Hey now... I stopped by My Sister's Closet on my way out of Last chance, as it is just literally a block or two away. They have some cute things in here, I scored a pair of Pilcro shorts for 10.00 as well as some Saucony running shoes for $12.00, not bad! This store is really small, and they have an odd mix of mall brand clothing all the way to higher end stuff. I saw a pair of size 9 tory burch miller sandals (brown brand new) for around $50.00, too bad they weren't my size or else I woulda snatched those bad boys up. Overall I think their selection is kinda small, I easily went through all the racks in 30 mins, if you have some time to kill you could get lucky and end up finding one or two things you really like.

$$$$ for breakfast or for lunch.. prepare to spend around $20.00 there is really no way around it. A meal normally runs around $13.00 and once you factor in a coffee/drink and maybe a fresh baked cookie or dessert.. you definitely end up paying a lot more than you anticipated BUT its worth it. Food is really fresh here, although sometimes their salads feel a little skimpy. I like to come here for the atmosphere, nothing beats a sunday morning spent on the farm eating brunch!

I normally don't like chain restaurants, but my boyfriend's family do, so we ended up here for lunch. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were definitely delicious! I also loved the idea of paying at the table with their new handy pay kiosks. Service was also good.

ZERO STARS, I have many pieces from this this company, and i lost the chain that went with my necklace so i decided to get a new chain, went to the store waited 20 minutes for service, no one wanted to approach me because they think that a college student cant afford to buy anyhing. when I finally was approached, the woman only showed one chain and said that was it, i said ok.. even though I had doubts she convinced me it was the only one they had available so I purchased it..... Transaction was fast.... in no less then five minutes she got hurried me out the door. Didnt say thanks or anything 6 days later I go to to the tiffanys in tucson... the manager heard my awful story, showed me all the pieces and even offered it to me for free.... thats what service should be, not pretentious but friendly and approachable

Last chance... the only bargain basement you will ever go to and see women with high end louis vuittons + chanel bags digging for cheap finds.   A couple reasons why I love last chance:  $2.00 basic tee shirts and tanks. Last time I was there I scored 3 north face jackets for $30.00 each.  Shoe selection is great, sometimes if you are extra lucky your shoe size might be going for an additional 50%.. this happened to me once.. and I walked out with 12 pairs of shoes.  High end Jeans/Slacks/Trousers are normally in the $20.00 - $30.00 range.  You can find odds and ends such as towels, decoration, blankets, sunglasses for really cheap if you have the patience to dig.  $30 leather boots!   A couple reasons why I hate last chance.  Anxiety level goes up when women trample over me, and plot to steal from my cart. Men's section is sparse, The line to the private changing room is painfully long, (if you are uncomfortable changing in their open changing area.) Make sure to wear a tank top and leggings so you can easily try on blouses/jackets and or shorts.. in the middle of the store. Many items are badly damaged, (holes, rips, stains) so everything you buy must be examined very very carefully.  Bag selection there is pretty terrible, prices are very high for Last Chance's standards, and bags are often broken, in bad shape, or need repairs. I often skip this section  Clothing/Items are regularly "dropped in" by the staff, during this time sections are "guarded" by security, and no one is allowed in that section until the staff has put all the new items into the section and has safely walked away. Security is very strict and almost mean, if you happen to even look greedy, as if you are plotting to get a particular good first.. security can kick you out so please be mindful of that.

Just came to this store and just this week they started implementing a new pricing system for the worse!!! All the items and the gems that I used to come here are priced so high that it's a joke. I mean seriously 50.00 for a Diane Von furstenberg blouse that is stained and has a hole on the side ? 50.00 for shoes that were normally 9.99? I'm fuming ! This place has lost my business until they can get it together

Schools out for the summer... Schools out forever? Haha just thought that was appropriate heading and ode to Alice Cooper since I am reviewing Big Bang + I came here last night and the place was kinda dead due to the lack of university students during the end of may. I liked this place, I really really did! I wish there was something like this in Tucson! I didn't pay a cover last night to come in.. unsure if it was because it was wednesday night or if its just summer.. and they didn't feel a need to charge since it was pretty much dead. Walking in you immediately hear the live performance and it really gets you going. I was able to sit front row no problem and I even talked and communicated with the performers. Service was great, and I really can't complain. I got to watch a "free performance" (I did tip them) and sip on some beers. Cheers to that!

Best dog park in Mesa... large area for dogs to play in.. tons of free poopy bags available, and theres even an option for us humans to exercise! Shoot if I walked this entire dog park 3x with my dog I would feel like I deserved an award (like some icecream perhaps?) because I totally deserved it! This place is clean, the people are friendly, the benches scattered around are nice, and yes there is grass! My dog and I love this place, and we will be back soon

Wow.. I love love D'lish. Food is so good and so well priced. I ended up getting the quinoa oatmeal for breakfast and with no regrets either. My friend got the breakfast bagel with eggs and bacon.. it was so filling that she ended up only eating half. I loved my oatmeal as well, the portions were perfect and it was D'lish! Would definitely love to come here for breakfast again

Solid four stars... food is great, and portions are good. I tried their fried okra and their sweet potato chips as sides and they were both very tasty. My boyfriend's mac anc cheese was not so good though, was a little lukewarm and the cheese was not cheesy nor did it have any flavor. Service is good, although I do wish they could just bring out tons of their bbq sauce all at once instead of serving it to us in a tiny little pan over and over again. Overall I'm a fan and will be back.

Whats up with the Zushi hate? This place is pretty good. There's a nice bar, the sushi is good, the service? I never had a problem! My favorite things to get here are the wonton soups HUGE PORTIONS.. so yes to that. The sunny beaches roll is divine, it has tuna inside and then nice pieces of salmon/lemon on top. Super yummy and perfect for these hot arizona days/nights. The only reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that this place is just a little expensive... 2 sunny beaches rolls, 3 orders of nigiri and 1 philly roll.. and Im looking at a 50/60 bill. Ehh.. oh well this place is literally   1 min away driving from my boyfriend's parent's house in Mesa.. so we definitely are partial to this place due to it's convenience.

Went inside a B-17 and received intimate knowledge of the plane's history and its crew. Tons of other aircraft and war memorabilia scattered throughout. Worth the admission price

Unfortunately this store feeds my lust for luxury goods.  Every time I make the drive up from Tucson.. I always try to come by. This store is set up like my dream closet! The staff here like many other Tory Burch stores are always on top of it. The customer service is A+. I absolutely hate it when salespeople try to push things on me, but these people never do! In fact they know just the right moment to jump in and help as I'm contemplating a shoe or a shirt. Oh and did I mention they offer little cokes and or water as you shop?

Two words people: FRIED PICKLES..   The fried pickles are literally what sent me over the moon.. they were nicely battered, fried to a perfect crisp.. and were juicy, spicy, sweet, and super addicting..  They were my favorite thing about Short Leash...   Now onto their amazing dogs... I ended up getting the March Special, it had cajun potato salad, bacon, and a spicy bratwurst.. soo delicious but definitely not healthy (if that it all even matters!). I honestly cannot remember what other things were in it.. but if you are in line right now trying to decide what to get.. like I was, please go with the fried pickles for $3.00, and try the March Special.. theres a picture of a cute white bichon frise on the food truck window that explains what the March special is, if that helps you out!

Really enjoyed this restaurant. I ordered the papaya salad and it was wonderful, although next time I would opt for no shrimps because the surcharge for adding shrimp was $4 and you only get 3 medicore pieces.. so that was a bummer. Other than that my entire party really enjoyed their food here. My bestie commented that although the place was good, it was a little too americanized for her taste which I could definitely see where she is coming from, nonetheless I enjoyed my salad and would come back to try more dishes.

YESSS this place is awesome. I can't wait to go back. The prices here are super reasonable for what you get. Shrimp and crabmeat cocktail was good.. and so were the stuffed bacon wrapped chorizo dates.  My ribeye steak was even better. I tried my boyfriend's scalloped potatoes they were creamy and delicious. Had I not been so naughty with food this past christmas season, I would have easily devoured the whole side of potatoes.. but too bad my conscious got the better of me this time. The complementary piece of fillet when we sat down was great, and so were the complementary bacon cornbread+bread basket.   Cholla's also gave us a small scoop of the sorbet as a palate cleanser which was a nice touch. For the price this place is legit. Honestly, the food, the service can't be beat.

I love Chipotle, and I love this location because they are serving sofritos here...what a nice option for vegetarians.. Chipotle's version of sofritos here is a tofu with a whole bunch of spices and beans.. so freaking good. I will be back for more for sure! I am also hopeful that other locations will start to serve this option because it really fills the need for an "Entree" meat for vegetarians!

Cheap burgers... love it, the original is the best. Burger sizes are definitely decent  , but the salads here are a little small even with the added on grilled chicken. I was still hungry after I finished my salad and even considered getting a burger to take home to eat, but decided not to since I was going to bed soon.  Shakes here are my favorite though, they are made with haegan daaz ice cream and they are the best, they even come with a little extra (whatever didn't make it to the glass) this reminds me of getting served a giant milk shake with the extra in diners back home in San Francisco when I was a little girl. I would recommend strawberry. =)

My favorite place 10 bucks for lbs and lbs and lbs and lbs of veggies+fruits!!! Make sure to get there early, you pay 10 dollars and get in a buffet style line.. you are allowed to take a certain ammount of whatever produces they allow. =) Supports a great cause... keep in mind you can't select your own produce here... and the produce here is very over-ripe, so make sure to get home and start planning+cooking your meals for the rest of the week!

Just came in and ordered several empanada s to try. Ham and cheese  El capitan The Cuban The peril The boricua The cheese And finally a sweet empanada, the fig cheese and caramel.   My favorites in the savory category are the boricua and the fig cheese caramel was jaw droppingly amazing. The boricua is filled with rice, peas, ham and is so moist it drips with a homemade sofrito sauce.

Friendliest starbucks I have ever been.. great hours!!!! open I believe at 4 am most mornings, the manager here is probably the nicest and greets everyone with a smile and engaging conversation. Tables here are always clean and is a great place to come and study.

TERRIBLE service. I came here on a Sunday morning wanting to get ONE smoothie. I asked the man up front how long it would take and they said less than 5 minutes.. 15 minutes later they give me my $6.00 smoothie HALF FULL. HALF FULL. These people were so busy that they had the nerve to give me my smoothie HALF FILLED UP. I paid $6.00 for that smoothie and not only did I have to wait 15 minutes for them to make my smoothie when the original wait time was under 5, they gave me a half full smoothie and then acted like it was completely OK. I ended up having to wait ANOTHER 10 minutes for my smoothie.. 25 minutes for a freaking smoothie, I could have literally gone across the street to Bashas and gotten some naked juice and called it a day. Instead I had high hopes for Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge and wanted to support a local business. I won't be coming back here, even though we literally live right across the street.

I love this place, my favorite cuisine first of all is peruvian, and I am so happy to say that El Chullo has become my favorite peruvian restaurant (thus far in my culinary journey). The ceviche here is perfectly spiced, the texture of the fish is great, and the sweet potatoes and the canchas (salted corn nuts) offset the spiciness, wow just typing this review makes my mouth water. I literally cannot wait to go back for more! The entree size of the ceviche isn't enough if you are starved, but its a perfect portion for someone who isn't too hungry. My boyfriend and I ordered one ceviche each and then we also ordered a lomo saltado to share. The lomo El Chulo serves is great, delicious thin fries, with nicely seasoned juicy pieces of steak topped off with onions, red onions and tomatoes. Order this if you are a steak and potatoes type of person. For dessert we shared an alfajor, 2 fine light cookies with dulce de leche stuffed between the two, finished off with a slight dusting of powdered sugar and chocolate on the side.   To be perfectly honest I was so full already from eating a ceviche and sharing a lomo saltado that I felt that I didn't have any room for dessert, but when the cookie came I HAD to have a taste, so I ate a bite and we ended up packing that bad boy up to go. All in all this place was great, people might think its expensive, but its 100% worth it to me. The flavours I get from peruvian cuisine is so unique and unmatched that I am more than happy to pay for it. Oh and did I mention our server Manny, *unsure if this is the right spelling* but man he was the best!!! He made us feel right at home, and even told us a little bit of himself and Peru as we were eating our dinner.    All in all it was a great time and a great meal! I can't wait to go back.. perhaps I'll stop in for lunch and or dinner tonight because honestly I just can't get enough.

Smoothies are amazing here. I would recommend their strawberry and banana =) Their thai tea is good as well. Their boba though was a little firm and too chewy for my preference, but the lady did say that they just cooked them up for me, so perhaps they pulled them out of the pot a little prematurely.

Really like this place, Nico one of the guys who works here is the nicest guy ever! Also bartenders here are fast, and the place is always really nice and clean even during a packed night! No entry fee to get in even with a full dance floor upstairs though its a bit too loud sometimes, as well as a stage where sometimes you can see great performers perform for free! I love the wasted grain and its one of the coolest places to hang out during the weekends!

Maybe I should have known better but given all the great reviews here I thought why the hell not? If its on the menu it should be good right? WRONG. We ordered the salmon with broccoli and sweet potato fries.. Salmon was super dry, the brocolli was super cold and was boiled should have been blanched, and the sweet potato fries were sooooooo soggy and cold to the touch! When we told the waitress she brought out a new hot basket but they were still super soggy. Literally limp sweet potato fries. Would not recommend the gourmet items on the menu.

Bad..  Came here Tuesday night and initially I was very impressed. The decor was beautiful and me and my friend were seated immediately. It was kinda slow, so we expected our food to come out quickly. Food almost took around 20 minutes to arrive, and when it did we were unimpressed. I ordered the 2 piece mackerel nigiri, and my friend ordered a $15.00 roll, (forgot the name).   We ended up getting 6 pieces of mackerel sashimi, with a bowl of rice (no complaints.. here.. more food for less money right? and the roll was really really small... like thinly rolled small and not worth the $$$ price tg.   Ok whatever, so I'm eating the mackerel sashimi.. and I literally started choking on what I thought was ONE fish bone.. turns out there were 3 fish bones stuck in my throat and I had to HACK them out. My pretty plate setting after this looked pretty disgusting with hacked up fish pieces and bone. I told the server and showed her the bones she seemed pretty shocked, but didn't really offer any real solutions other than that she would tell the chef. 10 whole minutes later she returns with MORE mackerel.. and she said that the chef checked it super carefully this time around.  I told her I didn't want any more but she insisted it was safe... I took one careful bite, and what do you know? MORE FISH BONES.   When she came back I told her AGAIN, and at that point she offered to get me something else (but did not tell me it would be on the house). I did not want to PAY more money to risk more fish bones in my mouth but I might have taken some cali rolls for free at this point cause I was STARVING, but I was honestly just irritated and wanted to get out of there.   She ended up offering free mochi because there would be no fish bones in there.. and took the mackerel off the bill. We ended up paying $15.00 for a bad roll, and me almost ending up at the emergency room because of the TWO times I had to pull fish bones out of my mouth.   Not worth it at all, but I guess it makes for a terribly cool, but still terrible story.
