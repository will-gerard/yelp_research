We love this vet! It's a cozy little mom and pop place that is just adorable. Both doctors are very knowledgeable and don't try to trick you into buying extra services just to run up the tab. We previously went to banfield at petsmart because we didn't know any better and we always felt like we had our pockets turned inside out when we left there. Not this place. They only recommend what you need and what is truely in the best interest of the animal. They are always available and accommodating and it seems like most of the employees really enjoy working there. The only downside is that the front desk girl can have an attitude which is definitely a turn off but the doctors themselves make up for it.  These guys are really good at what they do.

OK.... how this business doesn't have a million 5 star  reviews is unbeknownst to me.   I had ceramic tile and carpet throughout my home and I really wanted hardwood but I didn't want to do the work to maintain it. So i search and search on line and finally found the brand and style of tile that i wanted. I actually went to a different tile store down the street from these guys and on the way back decided to stop in.   Well... I was greeted by Kris who was very professional, asked what we were interested in but definitely was not salesy. She gave us a free sample and her card so we  could try it out in our home and some very rough estimates of how much things would cost. She offered to come out and do a free estimate and I accepted.  I did some more window shopping and found an even better version of the tile that I wanted so when she came to do the estimate (on time I might add) I asked if she could get that tile and she said no problem.  She was VERY patient with me because we should've started the work in March and I kept pushing it out and we finally started at the beginning of  May. But the entire time, she was completely understanding and not pushing to close the deal.  Now, because I have tile that looks like wood I wanted to get the smallest grout line possible,1/16 of an inch, I was VERY nervous about their ability to get it done right but at some point I needed to bite the bullet. Turns out I was nervous for no reason at all.  My floors came out ABSOLUTELY amazing. Like better than I could imagine. My floors look like they could be featured on Houzz.com lol.  They sent a VERY professional crew to our home, they showed up on time, explained what they were doing every step of the way, cleaned up at the end of their work day, even worked on Saturdays. It was all around a WONDERFUL experience. Carlos and his crew and PHENOMENAL! You're lucky if you are able to get those guys to do your install.  If you are thinking about getting any flooring done, do yourself a favor and call and ask for Kris. You definitely won't regret it.

I don't come to sushi eye for the sushi, I love the owners and the service!  The sushi is good but the service is amazing. Every time I come here I'm always greeted by the owners with a very exuberant welcome. I feel like I'm eating at my Japanese mama's house for Sunday dinner. It's a cozy family run business and the people that make the sushi aren't Mexican are actually Asian!   Anyway, give them in try if you're in this part of the hood, you won't regret it.

Hands down the best dentist in Arizona! If I lived in Prescott, I would drive to Scottsdale to see her. She worth every mile

This place is fit for a Queen! They have complimentary valet & wonderful customer service.  The grounds are impeccable, its really close to the crystal shops and the Aria and Cosmopolitan hotels.  They are all apart of the same chain so if you eat in Aria you can charge it to room at the vdara. The room is just DOPE. It is set up like a little apartment, two flat screen tvs a little mini cook top, dining area, two refrigerators, one with drinks etc and one empty one to put your own drinks in. We stayed here on New Year's Eve weekend and had a blast. It is located close to everything you need on The strip. stay and enjoy!

We contacted treeline to design and landscape our front yard.  Jeff came out, completely sold us on what we though would be a great design for our yard. We signed the contract put down an initial deposit and scheduled a start date. Well that's when the trouble began. 2 weeks after the official start date no one showed up.... we contacted Jeff and we were given some excuses them being behind on another job and we reschedule the start date.   The crew came on the second start date, did the job and it was 'OK'. The quality of the plants and the trees they put in were the poorest of the poor. It hasn't even been a year yet and most of our plants in our yard are dying or dead. The gravel that they installed is not the color gravel we agreed upon and they use the bare minimum, just enough to cover the dirt. One of the trees that they placed was so close to the house it almost looked like it was going to grow into the house.  The follow up is when it gets interesting. After the job was done we noticed a depression in the cobble stones plants that were dying that they installed. We called, emailed, sent smoke signals and we were completely given the run around between Tricia, Jeff, Mark.They completely avoid your calls, or communicate with you very unprofessionally via email. It took me reporting them to the better business bureau for us to get a resolution.  This should have been an great experience for us instead it was a contracting nightmare. We spent 7k on a front yard that will have to be redone. Find another contractor because if you use them ultimately you'll have to find someone to correct their shoddy work anyway.

Believe the hype.... it's true.  I haven't had my brakes checked in over a year because the last time I went to Just Brakes and got screwed. Well I decided on this place after reading all the reviews on Yelp and this is as good as it gets.  Called and made a same day appointment to drop my car of for general service and brake check.  When I walked in I was greeted by a friendly (but not too perky) girl who took my information and confirmed my reasons for leaving the car. 20 minutes after I dropped the car off, I got a phone call explaining what was needed to be done. I was told that if I did the brake job with them they'd do the other maintenance for free. I agreed to have them do the work and within an hour my car was ready to be picked up.  Everything from beginning to end was seamless and professional. They didn't try to sell me a bunch of crap that I didn't need. My brakes are great and I will definitely be going back to them for any other services I need.

Short Version: Go to Dr. Steig, pay him whatever he asks for, do exactly what he says,  HE'S WORTH IT.  Long Version:  The Office: Immaculate, relaxing, very open and airy. I go to the downtown Scottsdale, centrally located. I've been to the North Scottsdale office too, it's like a spa. Nice warm colors, beautifully decorated.  All in all a great physical place.  The Fabulous Office Staff: AH-MAZING!! Let me just say, I'll be getting my braces removed in a couple of months and I'm already having anxiety about what I'll do with out these ladies lol. Seriously, I actually look forward to chatting up with these girls. They're so friendly and welcoming. You can really tell they enjoy what they do and enjoy working with each other. Makes a HUGE difference.  The Doctor: This man right here..... KNOWS what he's doing. He is VERY confident in what he does (not cocky... although he definitely has a right to be) so he makes you feel very secure that you're going to look gorgeous when he's done with you. He's also has a very relaxed but focused personality. Just and all around great person. I posted some pictures of my "grill" before and now that we're 2/3's of the way through the process... that should be enough to drop what you're doing and call him immediately. BUT if it isn't let me give you a few more reasons....    The Experience: When I went in for my consultation, he was extremely professional, didn't try to sell me a bunch of stuff. He took some panoramic X-rays, and pictures of my smile, explained in detail how he would transform my smile from "meh" to "Daannnnggggg girl". After reading Dallas G.'s review I was pretty hype.... Anyway, the finance guru sat down with me to talk cost.... gave me the option of using the metal braces or the clear ones and the price difference but again, not salesy at all... more like option 1 cost X and option 2 cost Y.  I paid the bill and got the party started!  Every single visit I was always welcome with warm friendly smiling faces, seriously felt like I was attending a girls book club or something ... (well Dr. Steig isn't a girl but you catch the drift). The girls and the Doc explained in great detail what the next steps were, what i should expect, what they were going to do, how my teeth would be manipulated. They all know they're stuff.  I NEVER had to wait for any of my appointments, I literally would walk in and before my butt actually hit the chair one of the girls would be walking me back to the chair. I was in an out in a reasonable time and NEVER had an issue with scheduling appointments.  I stuck to the program and I kept progressing as promised.  This is important: WHATEVER HE TELLS YOU TO DO, DO IT.... RELIGIOUSLY!    If you're thinking about going to this place stop thinking and just do it, it's seriously will be the best investment you will make in yourself. He's a perfectionist and it definitely shows. I have a couple of colleagues who have recently completed their treatment  with a different doctor and their teeth still look jacked... now I know you definitely don't want to be that guy/girl that paid a grip to get your teeth fixed and you still come out looking like roger the rabbit...

Well I'm happy I finally found a decent Caribbean spot in the valley.  When you're craving some roti/buss up shut it's a good place to go if you're not in he mood to make it yourself. The service is kind of slow so  if  you are on lunch, might not be the best place.... but the great thing is it's real cooked food!

Overpriced...and underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, the food is flavorful but for $85 a couple I expected to be "wowed" and just wasn't.  There is a very large Asian section with everything from bone marrow to sushi. Unfortunately for me I'm not a huge fan of fish balls in the morning...   The presentation of the dessert was wonderful and so was the taste but again most people are not eating dessert for breakfast. I sampled a bite of everything so I could get my money's worth because I was not about to pay $85 for some eggs and bacon. I'll be damned.  Anyway, I think  there are cheaper alternatives to this.... Seek them out.

Good  food but the drinks are too expensive. Wait is usually an hour but the service makes it worth it. Pineapple upside down pancakes and the breakfast tacos are the best things on the menu IMO
