My week isn't complete without the message from Bishop Thomas! This church is amazing and does so much for the community. I am at home at Pilgrim Rest.

Rude Rude and extremely unprofessional! I walked in at 4:30 pm on Sunday requested fill with a polish change on my toes. After 15 minutes, owner walks up to me and says we close at 5pm. Told me to come back Monday. Wow, after 15 minutes of waiting. Bad business! Never ever ever ever ever will they get my business.

I meet a client for dinner and drinks. I was greeted by a Hostess who stated it would be a 30-40 minute wait. I wasn't given an option to order drinks or appetizer. Never the less, my client showed up 10 minutes late and we were seated 5 minutes later. It took our servers 5-10 minutes to greet us and order drinks. Our server was training someone that NIGHT. She suggested beef tacos and burrito and I LOVED IT TO DEATH!!! I almost LICKED my plate. drinks were GREAT!! The Chef sent me a few dishes to TRY and it was awesome. SERVICE wasn't the greatest but the FOOD made the difference. I need to get back there soon!!

WOOW!! I am so shocked about all the poor reviews! I have gone to this office every since it opened on 24th street and baseline with my whole FAMILY. My daughter contracted an eye ulcer and I didn't know what to do at the time. I called this office and asked for an emergency visit with no insurance. They rushed her into office to be seen and treated her to avoid her losing her eye. I didn't have insurance at the time because I was self employed they worked out a plan and payment for cash that was reasonable for me. If I had waited any longer she could have lost her eye like a classmate did the same week at her school. I feel like  they are family. They are so busy because they do GREAT work. I won't take any chances going to anywhere else EVER again...
