Big fan of LGO! Love the food and grocery store. Been here for most everything. Commuter sandwich is my favorite breakfast item and you can go wrong with pizza or rotisserie food here.

I went here with an emergency foot surgery back in 2007. Dr Crezee was my foot surgeon and he did an exceptional job, surgery was outpatient and only took an hour. Would highly recommend them! Back for other foot concerns.

We have enjoyed taking our daughter to swim kids! She has been in swim classes since 3 months and we have had great success with teachers Ms. Erin, Ms. Sage, Ms Shaunna, and now with Ms. Kelsey. Also tried their toddler tumbling course and it's a lot of fun. Highly recommend this place for the quality of their programs. The other staff have always been helpful with booking classes, answering our questions, and check in.

I typically don't give a place 5 stars unless the food knocks me off my chair but today The Good Egg on Dobson does. Christie was our server and she was super friendly. I ordered the eggs Benny and the sauce wasn't up to par. I made mention of it and asked if their batch was typ like this. They offered to bring me a new one or asked if I wanted to order off the menu, which I declined saying I would just eat around the sauce.. No biggie! But low and behold they bring me a new plate of Benny which my husband ended up eating. When we got the bill we noticed they didn't charge us for either Benny's and we asked if they could since I ate one but they insisted. So they get an awesome review today. We've been going here since we moved to the area in August and will continue to go here for brunch in the future.

This place is good! Total hole in the wall place, very Asian style decor, and decent size menu. Try the garlic beef and sesame chicken. Food came out quick and they always came by for refills.

Had a great time with my family! Super fun but a little time consuming if you get very detailed in the art. A variety of pottery options. Great activity with kids and for custom gift options. Download their app for coupon/discounts.

Friendly staff and great food! Always love going to Nellos and love the house salad and house dressing. Wish they took reservations for 5+ instead of 10+ but come early if you come here on Saturday. It fills up fast. Spinach pie, asian salad, and house salad all great!

I went to Alta today and was highly disappointed with the employees' level of customer service. I was looking for a particular shade and needed help with a make up line and no one was available to help, yet there was no one in the store. All three employees were chatting behind the counter. A girl in the store was checking out and returned to my area with the cashier for help. I asked them for help when they were free and they said they would come back to me when they were done at the counter. 10-15 mins later, no one came. No greeting, no help, no questions if I needed help, until I was checking out at the counter. I won't be returning to this store, or recommending this location to anyone. I sure do miss my camelback location!

One of my favorite pita jungle locations - great service, large space, and as all the other pita jungles, great food. I just wish the steamed muscles we're on the main menu. Waitress suggested the baklava bread pudding and it was very good.

For Chinese food this place is pretty good. Inside lacks a bit decor but what do you expect from a Chinese restaurant. They can accommodate large groups, and by large groups in talking around 12-16! Yes we had a group of 16 at this place. Some fav menu items: sesame chicken, honey walnut shrimp, and house fried rice. We've been here almost once a month since July. And the ladies know us pretty well now.

Yum! Definitely a good place for fresh seafood in Phx. Highly recommend! Make reservations and prepare yourself to not see the outside while eating at Salt Cellar. Had the crab cakes for appetizer, halibut and baked lobster as main course. All were excellent and service was an A+!

I'll always be a fan of four peaks; for their food and beer, especially the peach ale. Parking always sucks, and I wish they had a location open somewhere in the east valley like Mesa or Gilbert. Nachos and chicken strips are my absolute go to food items. You really can't go wrong with any of their beers.

Love sushi 101! Been going here since 2004. Great food and new specials weekly. All the managers are great. Try the spring rolls or yakisoba if your not wanting sushi. Otherwise the 101 and Palm Springs rolls are my favorite. Love their iced green tea too.

Yummmmmm I love breakfast and I loved my eggs Benedict. Only downside was my minuscule side dish of home fries and fruit was about 5 pieces hidden under my plate dressing of leafy veggies for decor. We called in for reservations (or to be on the wait list) and got there and was seated right away. They could do themselves a solid by expanding their space too.

We went here last night for dinner. The space is large with nice decor. Everyone was friendly and the food was great. We kept to our easy menu items; pad Thai, pad see ew, and Thai fried rice. They have a small kids menu and sturdy high chairs which was a bonus to us. The food is delicious with decent size portions. Wish they had crayons and coloring menus for the little one, but they were still very nice and prompt about everything.

It would be cool if the waiters menu tablets signalized with the call buttons, creates a bit of lag waiting for them if they're not around or see your light right away. Otherwise convenient, comfortable and decent menu. Mac and cheese, chicken tenders, etc., and bottomless popcorn!

If it weren't for the other Barros locations that I've been to in the valley, if probably NEVER go to a Barros ever again. This location hands down the WORST for a Saturday evening sit down with the family. Deserves negative stars. Manager on staff not helpful not apologetic for the fact that there are 8 families around me that have no food and have waited just as long as me for their food. It's been 45 mins and not even appetizers. If I called in an order 20 mins ago for pick up I'd probably have eaten my dinner by now. Horrible service and slow production by the kitchen.

We've had hit and miss here with groomers and them keeping tabs on groomer comments, one visit our dog was great, the next he's been having issues but we weren't told that in previous visits. Love the retail employees, super nice and accommodating. Great selection of stuff and treats. Can be a lil pricier than you chair pet stores, but why not support local owned!

I'm rating based on waiting on my reservation. If there were negative stars the reservation staff deserves it. Made a reservation, and showed up 35 mins early. Asked if it was better to keep on my reservation or to get on the wait list and low and behold everyone in the lobby has been seated before us, including wait and reservations. This is ridiculous.  Asides from the horrible hostess service, the manager was apologetic about the situation and our server and food was superb. Everything came out on time and tasted great. Drinks were filled and we were checked on frequently. Dishes were large portions so come hungry.

Went here a few weeks back and the food is great. Ambiance a lil on the darker rustic side, and music is pretty loud, so not the best family setting with kids. Long wooden tables and benches accommodate large groups and nice to have outside seating. Menu provides options from meat lovers to vegetarians, to sweet and spicy. Plan for about 15-20 for your food to arrive. Scene here is a mix of hipster and local residents on a weekday evening.

We had honest air duct cleaning come out to clean our vents to our recently purchased home. We knew previous owners had two dogs and with a baby on the way we wanted to make sure our vents were clean. Lance came out and checked out vents and assured and explained to us that they were recently cleaned. So nice and professional!!! Didn't charge us for even just the call out. Saved us money from having to do unnecessary work. They sure are honest! Brandon also was great to work with over the phone. Highly recommend these guys!

If there was an option to give this company negative stars, I would gladly do so. The owner of this company should message me directly so I can let them know about the horrible service we are and have had with them. Avoid using this company. They were contracted by our insurance company from the horrible storms from September and they have been horrible at communicating, billing, scheduling, estimators are not friendly. Their sister company Damage Control deserves high ratings, while DC Restoration does not.

Small family owned cafe. We went and it was busy but got a seat at their small bar table. Wife of owner busy working and super friendly. Owners kids work there too. Slightly under staff during busy time but they apologized and food makes up for it. Nothing fancy but good food. Try the chicken fried steak or corn beef hash. Everything looked appetizing though. Could use an upgrade or larger space.

Decently good gelato, variety of flavors, would definitely come back here again. Went here on a Saturday night with family and relatives. The place is definitely NOT great for big groups, and expect a line out the door if you go during busy times. They do have some outdoor seating. Cant remember what flavor I got but it was good. Id rank them higher than gelato spot for sure. They should open another place between biltmore and san tan.

I needed a back up hair stylist while my go to gal has been on maternity leave. My husband goes here and sees Richard Garcia. We took the whole family for a hair appointment and came out of here looking fabulous. Large flat screen TVs play shows while you wait or get your haircut. Richard does a great job and for someone who had never colored or cut my hair before he picked a color that I loved and was able to match and style my hair cut from my originally hairstylist no problem. I just wish this salon was closer to home. My husband has gone here for the last 4-5 years and he leaves here looking great!

This place is great. Didn't realize this use to be near where we lived previously until we were moving. Location is great, parking is so-so. Staff friendly, but definitely gipped me of my punch card. Some of the staff would only punch my card once, when I had bought maybe 4-5 drinks, when the card clearly reads items, not visits. Still have yet to try the signature "snoh" item, as Im writing based on my experience purchasing their boba drinks. Wish they could blend the drinks instead of just serving over ice. Overall good.

This place is understaff and needs more seating in the lobby. Labcorp in general needs more weekend locations to accommodate the overflow from this location. Let's add unfriendly check in staff to the mix and horrible parking. They may be swarmed with patients but they could help make the wait better by at least giving a little smile or something. Don't even bother with an appointment like I did, your still waiting a good hour or two regardless. And if you've tasted like me right now, you'd be all irritated as it is.

I love breakfast and this place was delicious. I love the pancake flight by far! They had a double chocolate on their flavor of the day and was by far my favorite. They get a minus star because I ordered sausage links on the side, and there was an eyelash or eye brow of some sort. Yes, I know it happens, but totally grosses me out. Asides from that incident, don't go late morning on the weekend. Gets super busy! They have decent outdoor seating, could use landscape upgrade, but all in all, good for big  or small groups and those with special diets.

Delicious and large portions! Small franchise burger joint with a full bar, they have two locations in Phoenix metro. We went to the Scottsdale location to meet up with friends for lunch and came hungry but left satisfied. Don't be deceived if you have little ones when you see the tall bar height table and chairs. They have high chairs and portable high chairs that latch to the table end. Very accommodating for a big family. Ambiance is loud, decor and style is modern, and great curb appeal from outside. I tried one of the recommended burgers by the hostess and it was delicious. If you have a sweet tooth like me, try the Nutella pretzel milkshake with your meal.

First time here this evening and food was yummy. The decor is a little outdated and the entrance doesn't provide much of an inviting area or place of respite if you were waiting for your table. It wasn't super busy when we arrived but slowly picked up while we were there. We asked for recommendations from the waiter and we selected the Stromboli, hero sandwich, and garlic bites that he recommended, all were delicious. The table next to us had pizza and pasta, and it too looked good. Large portions, as we had leftovers from out dinner. Looking forward to trying their specialty pizzas or even dessert next time. Wish the service was a little better, but our waiters swapped mid way through and the gal that helped us in the later half of our dinner experience was nice and apologetic for being busy. Didn't quite understand the swap. They are accommodating for young kids, but no children's menu? Or we did not receive one anyways. And do they serve free bread? It seemed like the other tables got complementary bread but we didn't get anything. Also, their water tastes funny, maybe time to upgrade the water filter system. But overall good food so we will be coming back.

This is a late review but wanted to give Green Tea bistro some kudos! Staff was friendly and accommodating and sat us promptly. I've been here for dine-in and take out and had good experiences both times. When we ordered take out they separated the sauce from the meat so that it wasn't soggy by the time I got home. Serving sizes are proportional to price. Good lunch menu as well. Can't go wrong. One of our new Chinese food go to places.

Large room atmosphere and friendly staff. Food is good and milkshakes are delicious. Ok kids menu, and they have happy hour on drinks and appetizers. Looking for basics? Try the zinburger. They have a veggie burger which is actually really good too. Decent parking nearby, expect a wait during peak time. Full bar too. We had great service last time we went here.

I had originally given this gym an ok review on FB, but I don't know that it deserves it ( I am going to remove it) my family Signed up in Nov 2015, and I patiently waited for the swimming pool to open (suppose to open Feb 2016, but was delayed due to inspection and construction), got sick for a month and today finally got a chance to check out their pool to lap swim. EXTREMELY disappointed. Pool was too warm and murky. None of the inset pool lights were working, which would require draining the pool to repair. Lane markers were painted, and not tiled. Not all the lane separators were installed. The gross part though is another person was using the pool when arrived, didn't realize I was there, and this guy blew snot into his hands 3-4 times and then rubbed his hands all over the pool deck!!! The showers are gross too. One area drain for 6 showers, no water pressure and the hot water took 10 minutes to even get warm. I heard they are opening another location but they need to give this location some TLC. I was trying to be optimistic for a local owned gym, but very disappointed in this place. Pool rating should have negative stars, but I am giving it 1 star for variety of equipment, and another star for having batting cages and gymnastics, as most gyms don't have. The place needs better lighting, and an interior designer to give it a facelift. Also forewarn, while they provide child centric gym classes, be expected to run into a group of kids running around the upstairs if you try to use any of the exercise equipment.

We called Lawson Family Plumbing to come out to check on something that we thought was a plumbing issue. Tony came out and assessed the issue and confirmed the work could be done thru our home warranty. The initial service call was of no charge and he was friendly and professional. If we ever have plumbing issues we will definitely give this company a call.

Friendly people and great food! Highly recommend this place to fulfill your Thai craving! We had the pad Thai, fried rice, and a recommendation by the waitress. So yummy. They accidentally forgot our pad Thai order but we're super nice and apologetic about it. They had great service and kept up with filling our drinks and water. Very welcoming upon coming in.

One of our local favorite breakfast places. Everything on the menu is delicious. They have a Nutella French toast on special right now, definitely try! Kids menu is only under $6, and decent portions. They've recently remodeled and inside looks great. Friendly and great service and there is outdoor patio seating. Come early, it fills up.
