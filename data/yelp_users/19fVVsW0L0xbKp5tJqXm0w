Well seems they were closed for some reason. But there was an older person inside that had no problem knocking on the window as we put down something on there door so we could pull out our phones and see where else we could go eat lunch.  We were going to trash it after (I was going to make sure of it). No talking other then to bitch about what we had done and make sure it was removed. No information or sorry they were closed. Shame as I'm a local and had 3 new co-workers who wanted to try this usually great  place. Great 1st image you created for yourself and for the Valley with this attitude!! Even I might think twice now before going to this location maybe even all locations. Time to hire people who know customer service even if you were closed a "I'm sorry we are closed due to.... We hope to welcome you back soon" would of been a nice touch. Not happy.

It's a Starbucks. Friendly staff at this location. They get the orders right and they are what it seems staffed properly as the line and orders are done in good time.

Love this place. Great food, wonderful waiters and usually food is served quickly. Great place to have a good night out with friends and colleagues. Now there loyalty program is AMAZING. Lots of places have you a free starter for your B-Day they give you a free burger. You also get $20 for going 5 times in a specific time frame.

Love how friendly the people are. This place has GREAT subs. Love going there and the way the food is super fresh and the meat and cheese is cut in front of you. Keep it up.

This is a wonderful community for all you pot/marijuana smokers out there! If you can't tolerate it or have an allergy to it like me then this would NOT be the place to move into. I have been complaining about this almost since I have moved in but they seem to never catch you smoking. Lisa has NO care for people's health at this complex and only thinks about money. If you should ever get cough by Phoenix P.D. for smoking pot then Lisa will give you a 2nd chance. (words out of her mouth) Sadly if you're in the same case as me and can no longer tolerate it and choose to leave you have to pay the break of lease fee of 1 month. I did try to fight it but sadly forgot to do one thing to avoid paying this and now it's to late. Lisa did not even have the guts to tell me the outcome of me having to pay after all this herself and had someone else from the staff call me to tell me. Lets not forget to add the cost of moving and breaking also ATD's contract and that's about $2,500. They also had break-ins with in the community and cars on the roof. The best part of all this is that they leave notes on your door to let you know about the break-ins so if you're out of town your apartment is now a great target. Bottom line if you're someone like me who follows the rules and AZ law and the others (pot smokers) don't this community will screw you over and this is costing me about $3500 total (Termination Fee, Move & ADT). So make sure you think twice before renting from here if you don't like the smell or have an allergy to pot/marijuana. If you do smoke it then this is a great place especially with Lisa here, as she seems to care more for the smokers then the non-pot smokers.  Now the positive side all the other staff here are wonderful helpful people and the community is close to the light rail. Another great point is they are very LGTB and dog friendly.

Great Place! When I was living in Phoenix I was there about once a month. 99% of the time the staff was great and super friendly. The food was always wonderful and there menu is changing for the better each time. I also worked for 2 of the big hotels in Downtown and would send as many guest as I could who were looking to eat out late or just a fun place to eat/drink. The mix of Asian food and a sports bar is wonderful and being open late also a big bonus as this is Phoenix where everything shuts early. They are also pet friendly on the patio for your 4 legged loved ones to join.
