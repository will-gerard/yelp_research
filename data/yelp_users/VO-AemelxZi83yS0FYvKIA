Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome.

Since the departure of Taste of Philadelphia at 32nd and Camelback years ago this has been one of the only quality spots in Phoenix for a cheesesteak.  Personally, I've never ordered anything BUT a cheesesteak but my wife says the Uncle Sam's Special sandwich is awesome.  They have several locations, but I'm partial to the 32nd and Shea store for some reason.  It just has that slightly dingy feel that makes the steaks taste that much better.  The waitresses in knee socks and cheer skirts don't suck either.  Only thing missing is a full bar.

I've been eating at Sesame Inn for more than 15 years, starting when there were down at Thunderbird and Scottsdale Rd.  I've even had the same waitress, Grace, all that time.  This is the only place I know of that makes Kung Pao Beef by deep frying the beef first.  It's unique and without peer.  Everything else is good as well, from the soups to the Mu Shu Pork to the House Special Chicken.

Awesome family owned business.  They always remember your name and little details about you, plus they do a great job.  Also, they'll box your shirts instead of using hangers which is the only way to go!

The original Cave Creek cowboy bar.  How can anyone argue with live bull riding?  Do yourself a favor though, eat before you go.  The food isn't bad, but I just kind of think its for the tourists.  The Pat James Band plays most nights and is incredibly good to have remained a house band all these years.  Go after 9pm, order something on the rocks and have fun.

The best fried chicken anywhere.  Period.

The original downtown "power" restaurant.  I could start a cult based solely on their bread with the garlic-leek-butter drizzled on top.  Everything on the menu is tasty, but don't expect Mastro's style steaks, great quality, just more of an old school broiler style.  Don't miss the "debris" as an app, delightful little skewers of grilled beef and veggies (they make a perfect lunch as well).  The red velvet walls, red leather booths and throwback waitstaff only add to the authentic Rat Pack feel.  Growing up in AZ every great story involving local politics seemingly involved the bar here.  Truly a local treasure.

Great steaks, perfectly executed side dishes, exceptional "steakhouse" wine list, meaning lots of full bodied choices, all the names that some diners seem married to and just enough obscure stuff to satisfy those who prefer smaller vineyards.  For a chain, they've also done an amazing job of giving the place a local feel.  Wine lockers with name plaques at the entrance, walls adorned with portraits of Arizona figures and a bit of Western Chic decor all help to set it apart from locations in other cities.  Oh, and their lunch menu is reasonably priced and packed with great stuff.  Solid place.

So I have this thing about long waits at breakfast places.  Every town in America seems to have at least one annoyingly popular place with a line  around the corner and overrated pancakes, omelets, etc.  Having visited Matt's on two previous occasions I found it to be great, but because it violated my "line theory" I've resisted embracing it.  Until now.  After meeting a friend at Matt's for breakfast this morning (and waiting about 30 minutes) I can honestly say that this place is the real deal.  The food isn't gourmet or even creative, it isn't supposed to be.  Rather it's classic breakfast done to perfection.  Exceptional pork, eggs, potatoes, breads, everything.  Although it pains me to say it, this is a breakfast place worth waiting in line for.

Really cool Cave Creek spot.  Everything's pretty solid, but try the Queso Guierllmo (spelling?) with a side of deep fried shredded beef (called "mochamos").  Yeah, I said it.  Trust me.

I have to admit, I truly don't think a better steak exists anywhere in the world.  Total perfection.  Also a great (albeit overpriced) wine list and great seafood.  Sadly, however, I find myself totally incapable of dishing out the requisite amount of ass-kissing required to dine and/or receive quality service here.  There's nothing I hate more than eating in a restaurant that acts like you're patronage is somehow inconvenient to them, especially considering the fact that I think my wife and I are pretty low effort, high return customers.   Ocean Club is worth it on occasion for the awesome food, as much as I hate to admit it.

After reading the reviews and hearing some word of mouth I finally had a chance to check out Forefathers.  It's umm, not rad.  It's not terrible either, but I would definitely drive several miles past it for Uncle Sam's or Corleone's.  For my money it's about a half a star above The Steak Escape or some similar abomination.

I'm surprised by poor reviews so far.  My wife and I go to Blowfish often and I don't think I've ever had a bad meal or what I'd call "bad" service.  The sushi and teppanyaki are always fresh, well prepared and tasty.  I hope people will give it another chance!

Ok, right off the bat I'll concede the steaks are quite as good as Mastro's (Ocean Club or City Hall) but they're damn close, and combined with the rest of the menu and the service its a better overall experience.   The food is GREAT, especially the shrimp with cream sauce (I forget the exact name, but its featured on the menu).  The steaks are well marbled, not overly seasoned and perfectly cooked, and my wife says the fish is terrific as well.  The bar pours real drinks and the waitstaff knows how to serve them.   My biggest problem with many of the best steak places in town is the vibe they give off that "you're just lucky to be here".  Not so at OP, rather it feels like they've been waiting for your party to arrive all night, which sounds cheesy I know.  Definitely a favorite.

Pretty good BBQ for Arizona.  The restaurant has a great Mississippi Delta vibe and the food is great.  If you don't feel like driving to Cave Creek they deliver through Delivery.com.

My wife and I went for lunch yesterday.  Really cool decor, perhaps a bit much for some guys, but definite points for originality.  The Lunch menu was varied but not overwhelming.  The skirt steak looked interesting but we were told it had been eliminated due to prep issues, bummer.  Overall the wine list was disappointing, although I did like the concept of a few really special wines by the glass, although at $35 per we passed. Wifey had the Kobe Cheeseburger and I had Shrimp Scampi.  Both were good, although neither were memorable.   The service was terrific all around.   We'll check it out again for dinner...

Dude, this place is beyond bad.  It replaced another sushi place called Katana Sushi that wasn't open long enough for us to try it.  We dropped in for lunch the other day and had the place to ourselves, literally.  My wife ordered a very simple roll with tuna, cream cheese and cucumber and I ordered what I thought was beef fried rice (primarily because nothing else on the menu looked appetizing).  Her roll came out resembling nothing akin to tuna and after one bite she refused to touch it saying it tasted "off".  My "beef fried rice" reminded me of something my mom would have tried to pass off to me as "chinese food" when I was 10.  It was like rice and odd beef chunks stewed in ketchup and soy sauce.  I'm serious.  Oh, and a bug crawled out of my salad.   A few days ago I passed a guy standing on Cave Creek Rd NORTH of Tatum holding a sign that simply read "Ari Sushi", no arrow, no address.  He was holding it up for drivers that were a block past his restaurant already.  Not sure what institution these folks escaped from but I'd steer clear.
