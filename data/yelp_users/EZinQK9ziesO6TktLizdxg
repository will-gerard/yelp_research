My two daughters and myself have all been seen here and I am quite impressed.  Great friendly service.  The dentist is very nice and patient.  I really like this office so far and would recommend them.

I have done many staycations and have to say this resort has a lot to offer.  Water is every where free of charge.  Bottle water in the room was free and water stations with citrus and cucumber was available.  This morning was surprised to see the water stations were now coffee stations.  Very nice staff, clean rooms, and a nice pool.  We will definitely be back.  They have spa specials, you can get a massage for $69. May have to try that out today. One star lost because both days while I was here I was woken up early by the hotel.  Day one housekeeping came knocking on the door to ask if we had an alarm clock going off which we didn't even here one?? Second morning fire alarm went off in the hotel only to go off a minute later?? So much for sleeping in on the staycation.  Otherwise everything was food.

I really enjoy this course.  Desert and water landscape.  Not to difficult for me as I am far from being a pro.  The staff is really friendly.  The only problem I have is I never see the beverage carts.  You have to stick up from the gift shop because you are not allowed to bring your own and I think I've seen a beverage cart once in the 10 times I've played here.

Great food!  Homemade tortillas that are very good.  The horchata is the best I had, others most also think so because it sells out before I get there half the time.  I have had their breakfast burro, green chili tostada, and menudo and been very pleased with all.

This place is awesome.  Whether your going to the lounge for an old time favorite drink or whether you are having breakfast in the diner portion.  I had a grasshopper the night we went and it was pretty yummy!  If your in Vegas this is a must do!  So glad some friends took us here, this will be a spot we will be sure not to miss next time we are in town.

This has to be the best Mexican market in the valley.  Huge selection.  We bought the carne asada and had them add the marinade, it was delicious.  They also have a large variety of prepared food we were hungry so grabbed a bowl of concido which was delicious.  The bread selection was very large.  We will definitely be back.  I gave 4 stars because the prices were a little higher then we have seen others.

Prices are not bad but you get what you pay for.  Twice I have paid an extra 5 for the hot rocks, gave them a second chance, both times they just slid the rock up and down my leg, no massage or technique, very lame.  The place is not as clean and I question whether they properly clean the tools.  I won't be giving them a third try.

We used to live right by Maria's, we now live 12 miles away and still continue to eat there as much as we can.  If you want real authentic Mexican dishes this is your place.

Food is always great at Outback.  We like to sit at the bar and eat and have a few beers.  We have been to this location three times and the same bartender has been on duty, Friday night.  She is rude and acts as though you should be grateful she is there.  VERY passive aggressive.  If you like to sit at the bar I would recommend heading up to Chandler location were you will receive customer service and not be forgotten (twice they forgot to put our order in) no apologies just rude sarcasm.

My car died.  Wouldn't start.  I have a push button start car and honestly could have been anything as far as I knew.  I took my car here based on a previous positive experience and the yelp reviews.  I called the morning after I dropped my car here and was told they would check a few things and told me they may have to do a diagnostic that would cost $95 but he would call me back to let me know.  Shortly after this Rusty called back to let me know the battery was dead.  He told me his price and I knew I could get a battery cheaper at Costco.  He told me no problem, they didn't charge me a dime.  I will definitely be back with my car any time I need anything.  Integrity is huge in this industry and I do believe you will find it here.

I live close to this place and have been quite a few times.  The few times I was able to get Michelle to do my nails have been awesome.  This review related to everything but Michelle.    All other pedicures have been mediocre or bad.  There is one gal who has done my nails twice that has in both cases made me cuticles bleed and be painful.    A few months ago I took my youngest daughter to get her haircut there and the lady did a great job, cut was super cute.  I had asked during that visit for a pedicure while I wait.  I was told they were too busy so I sat in the waiting area.  After about 20 minutes walk ins came in and they were taken right back for a pedicure?  Not sure what happened there but that was the last time I would get nail services here.  Today my two daughters and myself went to get haircuts.  Shampoo, cut, and style for $35 each.  My youngest did receive all but they lady never once asked her what kind of hair cut she wanted just trimmed it up.  My oldest was ridiculed for the tangled in her hair, her hair is very long.  She left with wet unstyled hair.    I showed my gal a picture of the cut I was looking for, in turn she cut my hair inches shorter then what I would have expected, she did no texturing or anything to the bottom of my hair, put some mousse in my wet hair and said the hairspray and products are there if you liked to use them and walked off!?! I went to the counter and asked about the style, I was told all haircuts come with a style.  I said does my hair look styled to you?  She did have a man come over and ask if I would like my hairstyles but at this point I just wanted to leave, I was mad.  I got home and blow dried my hair to find a large section in front that was about 3 inches longer then the rest of my cut and another 2 lumps in the back.  My hair looked like a bell.  After a little cry I went to. The Edge Salon.  I walked in clearly upset and asked them if I looked like I just left a salon and got my hair done, to which she just apologized for them.  Everyone in that salon was shocked that so much of my hair was at so many different lengths.  So a second shampoo, cut and a real style later my hair looks like it should have the first go round.  I have never experienced a bad cut until now.    I will never step a foot in here again and so mad that it cost me $120 there today to figure this out.  Shame on you, shame on your customer service!

Dropped in with my expired Groupon.  Basically used my Groupon as a credit which they were happy to do.  Got waxed and must say was one if the best waxing experiences ever, great job and she took her time will definitely use her from now on.  Then pedicure... Awesome pedicure.  The while experience felt relaxing, not rushed at all.

This was one of the best pedicures I've had.  Great massage.  Didn't feel rushed, was truly relaxing.  I will definitely be back and hope it's the same the 2nd time around.

After receiving a really horrible haircut from another place I came into this salon based on the reviews.  I was clearly upset that my hair was at different lengths and shaped like a bell.  From the receptionist to all the stylist they made me feel at ease.    They were able to accommodate my no appointment cut very quickly.  Jose immediately had ideas to clean it up and make it right.  He did an amazing job, I am very happy with my cut and will be back to see him.

Food is over priced and very bland.  Husband had the steak burrito and I had a chicken quesadilla.  Both of us agreed that it was bland and needed flavor.  The place was packed which leaves to believe that either it is new and people are trying it out or there is a market for bland Mexican food.  The drink bar did have a nice selection of options, that would be the highlight of our visit.  We won't be returning.
