I've been coming to MacAlpine's on and off for about 8 years and I still can't get enough.  Monica and Cary (owners) are two of the most hard workers small business owners that I've had the pleasure of knowing.    MacAlpine's is Phoenix's only still existing original Soda Fountain and a true gem.  Filled with vintage decor and charm, it's a fun time warp every time I go in there.  Their shakes are delicious and so big you get the leftover serving in the metal mixing cup.  Their food is tasty and like mum made it.  They always have vintage tunes on and you can browse the antiques and collectibles next door in between dining.

We've been coming here for years and the food is consistently yummy.  The service can be a bit hit or miss sometimes, but their complimentary banana bread and rolls surely make up for it!  Fresh baked and super tasty these pre-dinner freebies are one of my favs!  I usually always get a seafood noodle dish (Nagasaki Sara Udon or Yaki Udon) and am always delighted at the flavors and large portions.    Cherry Blossom is a quaint place, where you can watch the chef's at work and always good for a tasty meal.

Stop what you are doing right now, drive to Liberty Market and try their BREAD PUDDING.  Ok, I don't typically like Bread Pudding.  It has a bunch of raisins in it (not my thing) and it's usually a bit dry and uneventful.  The Bread Pudding at Liberty Market is moist, flavorful and topped with delicious fresh whipped cream, it's absolutely amazing!  The waiter even did a little song to accompany it's grand entrance.  Service has been great on the two times I've been there.  Their bathrooms are awesome and unisex (so European, ha ha) and on both occasions that I've eaten there the food has been delicious and fast.

Completely shady.  Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.  Completely unethical and total crooks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

The best experience I've had with a mechanic so far! You feel like a rock-star with their exemplary customer service. A great waiting area and prompt service, I will definitely be back again!

This past weekend I finally made it out to the NCT in Mesa.  And I definitely was not disappointed.  Nestled in a cosy strip mall in Mesa, with plenty of convenient parking I was thrilled at intimate and funky interior.  Cool old Movie Theater seats and the smell of popcorn!  The players were really funny and talented.  I like the competitive aspect of having them in two teams and I also really loved the games, especially 5 things!  Really awesome Independent Venue, we'll be back for sure!

If you want to experience PHOENIX then PAZ is the perfect place to celebrate the things that make this City unique and awesome: Fresh delicious food & tasty cocktails ($3 Marg). Vibrant murals and art adorn the inside and out, bringing the whole corner to life. Live music, dancing & ping pong. A super family friendly venue, you can feel the love that the owners have for food and this city through the presentation of their meals and the complete dining experience.
