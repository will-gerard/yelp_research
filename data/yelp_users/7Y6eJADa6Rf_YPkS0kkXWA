Worst nail salon ever. I have attempted to go to them 3 different times and my nails always look uneven and they chip the first day.

Best dentist ever! Especially if you have a child who is afraid of dentists because of a bad experience. Dr. Ostler is so nice and patient with my child. So much so that she is now not afraid to go to the dentist anymore as long as he is her dentist. I also just found out that one of my good friends also see's Dr. Ostler as well as brings her 3 daughter's to him. Her exact words when she found out that my child sees him too was "Isn't he the best and nicest dentist ever?!" My reply "Yes, we love him, he is so nice and patient with my daughter and I." I can't say enough good things about this dentist. He is awesome!

BE WARNED! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! DO NOT BUY A AUTOMOBILE FROM THIS PLACE! Horrible! Crooks! If I could give them a negative 100 rating I would. I bought a car a little over a year ago from them and have put $200.00 to $800.00 into repairs nearly every month that I've had this car. So I have put thousands of dollars in repairs into a car I bought only a little over a year ago and I just put $700.00 into last week and it is already causing me more problems. I need to get rid of this piece of crap car I bought from this place asap. I have bought used cars all my life and have never had such a piece of crap car in my life. NEVER! Not even close. The main guy who is over weight and missing teeth at this place is a sleezy crook. BE WARNED! GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! DO NOT BUY A AUTOMOBILE FROM THIS PLACE! I HIGHLY recommend going down the street and buying a car from 'WD Smith Car Company'. My family and I have bought multiple used cars from them for the past 15 years and we have never had any problems with their cars. I should have just stayed with them and not tried someplace new. Lesson learned. GO BUY A CAR AT 'WD SMITH CAR COMPANY ' BECAUSE THEY ARE DEPENDABLE AND NOT CROOKS. Ask for Brian. He is the owner and he is so nice!

I'm leaving another review because a few weeks ago I just had to put another $800.00 into the car I bought from them because it overheated. I now have to get my car towed to my mechanic once again this morning because it overheated again. I would also like to inform you that the owner of J & M Imports private messaged me on Yelp after he saw my first review on his crooked business. He sent me a message stating that I never bought a car from them and that they never had a fat guy who was missing teeth working for them as I stated in my original Yelp review of this crooked dealership. He used the word 'never'. And then when I responded to him saying that maybe they don't have a fat  guy with missing teeth working for them now but they did last year when I bought the car from them. So then the owner messaged me back stating that that guy doesn't work for him anymore.  Does anyone see the problem with this conversation I had through private message with the owner? Did J & M Imports  never have a fat guy with missing teeth working for them or did they? It can't be both, yet the owner claimed both options in his private message convo to me. He lied. He said they never had a fat guy working there, and then in the same conversation he told me that that guy doesn't work there anymore. What a liar! This dealership is so dishonest that the owner can't even keep his lies straight in a private message to one of his customers that he took advantage of. I screenshoted the private convo the owner and I had on Yelp and posted it in the pictures section on this Yelp page just so you can see what I am talking about. The proof is in the pudding. Also, I have had multiple people contact me on Yelp since seeing my first review of J & M Imports and tell me that J & M Imports screwed them over too. Even one guy suggested I call the BBB or '03 on your side' on J & M Imports. Be warned, this place is not a good place to buy a car from.

Fantastic food! Everything is made from scratch. I've even heard this place compared to the famous restaurant in the movie 'When Harry met Sally' called Katz's Deli. The customer said that Deli on the Boulevard made just as good of sandwiches as the famous New York restaurant in the movie.

Horrible! If I could give you guys zero stars, I would. You guys deserve a '-10' rating at the very least. I will never be back! I have a chronic pain condition called 'Interstitial Cystitis' and it is also known as 'Painful Bladder Syndrome'. I have been in pain from a flare up from my Interstitial Cystitis since Friday night and I have just been trying to deal with it and hoping it would go away. This morning(Sunday) it woke me up in pain at 3 in the morning and I couldn't go back to sleep, so I decided to go to your urgent care as soon as you guys opened even though I really didn't want to because it was Mother's Day and I had to bring my daughter along. When I got there the doctor refused to see me. He wouldn't even speak to me because he knew that what I needed was a refill on my pain medication just from reading what the reason was that I was there for off of the paperwork they had me fill out. I understand that you guys have had a lot of problems in the medical field recently with pain medication unfortunately and so you guys are protective about that. But to completely not even listen to a patient who is in excruciating pain from a very real chronic pain condition on Mother's Day when she shows up with her child is probably the most disgusting treatment I have ever received from a doctor's office. The empathy and sympathy factor is missing from your office. I read your reviews on your website before going and ALL of them are negative but I decided to try you guys anyways. Big mistake. Reviews are there for a reason.  You guys obviously have horrible reviews on your website for a reason. I am surprised that you have any good reviews on yelp because EVERY single review on your website is negative. I couldn't believe your doctor wouldn't even talk to me. He didn't have to prescribe me anything but he could have at least heard me out and faced me and treated me like a human being. But instead he had his front office lady tell me that he wouldn't do it. And when I asked her if I could please just speak with him she kept repeating that he would not do it. What a coward! What a heartless practice. And on Mother's Day no less. You have a mother standing there in excruciating pain and he didn't even try to listen to me. I ended up having to go to the emergency room where they actually understood my condition and where they actually listened to me and where sympathetic and treated me like a human being. But unfortunately I had to sit at the emergency room for a few hours on Mother's Day with my child to get that help which was what I was trying to avoid by going to you guys. I didn't want to have to go to the emergency room with my daughter on Mother's Day, I just wanted the pain to stop. The Emergency Room listened to me, and they understood, and now I feel much better no thanks to you guys. I will be telling everybody that lives in this area about my experience as well as putting my experience on Yelp and anywhere else I can warn people of your heartlessness. If you are going to be in the business of helping people then you could at least show a little sympathy and empathy when someone is very visibly suffering and at the very least listen. You guys just opened and EVERY single one of your reviews is bad. You guys better get it together or you are going to go down like a led zeppelin. And it's going to be nobody's fault but your own.
