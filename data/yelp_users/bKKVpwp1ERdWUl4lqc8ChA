Not sure how they got four stars. The place is cute but that's about it. It is unkept and feels dirty and old, it has a potential of being a great little cafe if they would serve good food.  Often run out of ingredients, the sandwiches are not cheap and they don't give you much for your $.

Tried it again. Still not good. Great service! Cute store. Sandwich just not good. I tried the tuna on white rye. First of all not sure why he recommended that for a to go and eat in the car option. Not easy... But the flavors were just not there. Oh well.

BEST croissants I had in Arizona !  Owners are very nice and friendly. I didn't try much more but it is worth a stop just for that !

I LOVE Postino. I come here often with my girlfriends for lunch or bring my our of town friends for a nice hangout, $5 glass of wine at lunch and brochette to die for. Really, the best lunch in town.   Service is always on top of it and friendly. Really outstanding.   My one note was my last experience - I came in Saturday and had a very unpleasant experience with the valet manager -  Logan. He was being so rude and short with us we almost left ! All we asked was - since when they block all the spot when you turn in to Postino Arcadia as it used to be available to self part.  If this was my first time coming to Postino - I probably would have... It was still great once we went it. As always is :-)

Love this place ! The owners are very friendly and make you feel welcome. It feels like you're in a NYC Italian restaurant. :-) Food is creative and delicious . Service is great. We keep coming back !  You really should try it.  Either as a couple or as a group - this place works.

Bar gets 5 stars. Restaurant get 3... atmosphere is awesome. Great design, amazing view ! Love this place. Drinks at the bar are good and the bartenders are friendly. Our service at the restaurant wasn't good , our server couldn't describe the dishes or recommend them. He kept forgetting about us and we actually went to the hostess to pay because we couldn't find him... Food was good but nothing amazing (I'm sure a big part of that is the service) .  Great place to take out-of-town friends or a first date ;-)

Had dinner there the other day. Again - I love the design and atmosphere. Service was good but the food... not worth the $$$ they are asking for. Starting with the kids option - I ordered the pasta with marinara sauce which the server told me will have short noodles for easy pick up by a small toddler, it was made of long wide noddle, even after cutting it was not fit for a child. I ordered the grilled cheese which was okay, really not tasty as it should be.  My friend and I shared the rock shrimp which was awful, tasteless and the shrimp was not cleaned through so we had some crunchy sand like experience. Then we shared the corn flat bread which looked and tasted like airport food.  We decided to leave and got our check - for what we got paying that much was a big disappointment. They didn't even take the kid pasta dish off... $5 people... really?  I will not go back unless it is for drinks only. The two stars rating is for design, location and an okay service. Food deserve ONE.

I like Over Easy. The former location had more charm but this one is bigger and you don't have to wait as much :) The food is great and the owners are wonderful and friendly.  We just ate breakfast there. I got the 3 eggs over easy with mushrooms. The eggs were way too raw. I told the server about it and I asked to just get 2 eggs over easy instead of remaking the dish as the kid in the table was getting grumpy. That's what I ate for breakfast. The server didn't take it off the bill. I wouldn't say anything about it but I didn't get to eat the dish I wanted but still got to pay for it. Not cool. The Ppllo Loco is great !  Hopefully this is a one time issue and the owners are still on top of everything like they used to be.

Well. Disappointing.  I like chompie's bagels. I stop there often on the go but this yime we decided to sit there. A jewish family of four.   Ordered scrambled and cheese for the little guy. Asked for turkey sausage. No bacon please.  Kid got the plate. Has bacon. I chase the server and explain I asked for no bacon. Giving him the plate back and walking to my table. He comes after me and says so you want turkey sausage? I say yes. No bacon for us.  He says oh okay, I'll just take it and grab the bacon from the plate with his hand!!! Beyond the shock I say : well ... it's a religious thing. I don't want bacon on his food please make a new one . He looked pretty surprised by my stand but walked away .  After that it was just all mediocre.  Food was okay service not. Never got offered more coffee even.  Would not recommend. What a shame letting it go like that.

One of the best restaurant in town. I have been there few times and they really manage to wow me every time ! The owner if nice and friendly and is really on top of things. The service is great and the food is amazing ! We are going again this Saturday and I can't wait to taste their New Years eve menu. Happy New year :)

We went there again on Saturday. The service was great this time! David was great. Our dinner was good, no doubt about it. But we were missing the WOW factor we had the time before.  Myshroom foie gras soup was the highlight. Escargot was dry. Lamb special was good.  Can't say it is one of the best meals I had in AZ but I would definitely recommend it! I will go again soon to see if the first experience was by chance or the second one :)

Probably the best sushi in town. Fresh fish - always ! (not easy in AZ) We always enjoy the strong drinks . Not much changes in the menu and the specials repeat, so I would like to see more creativity but overall I love this place!  The bar upstairs should be open for people who eat at the restaurant. You should not sand in line or pay the bouncer to get in after you spent $200 at the restaurant...  I would definitely recommend trying this place! I think they have great happy hours and summer specials right now. Worth a try !

Great spot for good food and great drinks! We sat at the bar and had few Mission margaritas which was great. Then we had the guacamole , table side. It is delicious but not enough for four people. I had the hanger steak ! It was cooked perfect ! I would definitely recommend it!

Amazing food, Brilliant concept ! You get a list of items and you pick which one you DON'T like/ want and they will improvise and cook for you according. It is such a fun way to explore and try things.  It is not cheap... but is definitely an experience worth trying :) It has been a while since I went but I still want to add my only bad comment, after our 6 course tasting menu and a foie gras add on (totally worth it !) the two guys at the table came out still hungry... When you pay this much you don't want that to happen. But again, it has been a while. Go try it and let me know what you think !

Great neighborhood spot! Love the deign and at atmospher. Service was amazing and the food was great.   We had the chicken meatballs ans Zucchini pancake for aps - both great! Child's quasadilla wasn't as popular but our server noticed, apologized and asked to replace it, they took it off our bill. Our dishes were D-lish! The cast iron chicken, searen salmon and shepherd's pie. The clams weren't as good but still enjoyable. We really enjoyed it and we look forward to going again soon !

One of the best meals I had in Arizona !  We decided to sit outside as we went there on a Wednesday and it was too quiet inside (but great design inside and we would try it next time!) . We heard good things and were looking forward to trying it. WOW !!! the setting outside is perfect, quaint and cute.  The Burata salad was just perfect. The basil pesto worked so well with the cheese and walnuts. We also had the pork belly my husband just LOVED and I had the smoked trout with goat cheese - delicious !!! For entree we had the papardelle and the gnocchi. Both were great ! the pastas are made fresh daily and you can definitely taste that. Really amazing food!   For dessert I got the cannoli. It was good.  My only comment about the place, which is not really negative, was that our server, as great as she was, would be better at a stuffy restaurant. She gave great service but was not friendly, did not encourage chatting or joking. More proper/ formal service than I would like at a restaurant like that. This place is still a secret. Not for long... ! MUST try.

Great spot! Went there last night with a bunch of girlfriends for HH. They had a great band playing (a little too loud for HH ). We shared some aps and flatbreat, their goat cheese flat bread was really good!  They really did a good job decorating the space and the round bar is great ! I would definitely recommend trying it !

Had lunch there. Service was great. Good atmosphere. Like the overall design. The food on the other hand was absolutely horrible.  The pretzel fondue to start was okay. Nothing exciting. We had a cheese burger that was thin, dry and really something you should get at McDonalds for a dollar (NOT $9!) Tabbouleh salad was just not good. Over all I would not recommend. Bad food.

Great restaurant. Food was fantastic. The crab cake is a MUST. The special of raw scallops were so good! Service was perfect.  The band playing Saturday night was really good !  We live closer to Wild Fish so we probably won't drive up to Scottsdale Quarter but I would recommend trying either when you can.

Well... I should have listen to all the reviews I read here so it is totally my fault.  When I booked my apt for a blow-dry I mentioned that I read reviews on Yelp that weren't impressive but I want to give them a try as I live close by. My hairdresser didn't know how to blow-dry my hair. It was a mess. She kept asking another girl (that just stopped working there) questions on how to hold the brush and which brush to use. I realize they all have to start somewhere but maybe they should be supervised ?  I didn't leave with wet hair like others but it wasn't what I wanted my hair to look like (and pay for) . It took her an hour (!) to do that so even though I mentioned I wasn't happy I didn't have the time to stay there longer.  The owner was there the whole time but it doesn't seem like she supervise her staff or care about the satisfaction of her clients.  Again, my fault, should have trust my fellow yelpers :) I love seeing places opening in Arcadia, especially that they are done so well, but that is not enough to keep us coming. You actually have to have good service for that.

This place had a great atmosphere for lunch, great people watching (Scottsdale women!) and great service. Food is a hit or miss . Some days I have a great experience and others I feel like the food is lacking in flavor and they are charging too much. It is not a cheap lunch but when it is good it is worth it .

What a shame, I was so excited to try it ! I booked a session for today and ran five minutes late, I called 30 minutes ahead to let them know I was late and heard a "no problem". When I got there my waxer took me back to the room and informed me that because I'm late she will have to remove one of the services, which one would I  like to remove... I explained I have a vacation booked so I need it all for this weekend, she explained she can't. I chose to leave and booked an apt with European Wax Center. Shame, so close to my house, looked cute, wanted to support it. Oh well.

I was really looking forward to trying this place out. I love their restaurant ! But I was disappointed. The concept is great ! I love the house rules and the "call us and we'll come get you" . But it is not as charming inside. It was way too bright for a lounge but overall cute space. The drink menu (which you can only order from) is nice but really doesn't cater to those that don't like sweet drinks. I personally will have one , maybe two of the cocktails on the list but then I won't want any more. too sweet, too fancy. I like my liquor simple. Now, if you have a professional mixologist there - wouldn't it be great to tell him/her what I usually drink and they will create a new cocktail for me based on that instead of making me leave the place beacuse I don't like their cocktails? It also takes long for some of the drinks, they should mark those that take 10 minutes to "cook". Our cocktail waitress was very nice and friendly and the mixologist definitely knows what he's doing.  They charge a 20% service fee that our waitress explained to us goes to everybody else and now much to her... NOT okay. Charge me more per drink. Don't charge me %20 service and then I'll have to tip over that. Overall I guess good idea, great concept. Wrong execution.

We had breakfast there for the fist time a couple of days ago. It was delicious !!! We set inside but the patio seating looks great ! They have one side for table seating and one  side for bar seating . I like the layout.  The food was great ! Their whole wheat pancakes are the best I had. and their buttermilk fennel bread was amazing ! The omelet was cooked perfect. We were pleasantly surprised (we haven't heard about it before) .  Go try it !!!

Really cute place. I ordered to go but can already tell service is great! I got two pizzas. The dough is fantastic, the flavors were good ! I added a picture of my mediterranean pizza. Really good i just thought it was missing cheese... I like cheese on my pizza... Got simple cheese for lids. They wanted more cheese but that could be a kid (my kids?) thing. I would definitely go back and try it again.

Great design. Very clean and pretty. Service, not great... girl at front has no idea what is going on. Made an apt but for mani pedi. My manicure was quick and just okay. Polish is bumpy. Then I was moved to chair and I had to wait 25 minutes for anyone to come . At that point I had 25 minutes left so I could only get their quicker service. The guy kept poking me, was unpleasant and it was not relaxing as we had to rush.  This might be part of opening pain so it is probably wirth a try later on but I left with no need to go back :-(
