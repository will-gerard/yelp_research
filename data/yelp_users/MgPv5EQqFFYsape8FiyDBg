While it's a great alternative to Circle K in that there is a huge variety of items available, it'd not necessarily cheap by any means. It's as if the owner went to Costco and is reselling it. I'd like to see more support of local products, especially if it's going to cost more anyway.

They have a vegan option. It's nice to have more options near the Garfield that are open late too. Also, it's all about the grilled cheese on the biscuit with bacon added. The sides that come with the dishes are disappointing. I'd prefer a smaller/easier to eat sandwich with some sauteed veggies.

I like the vibe of the place and it is well known because of First Friday. But I think they rely on too much with the vibe they try to give off and not enough with customer service. They need to understand although me and other people may not be in their circle, I would like a sense of respect because I am still a paying customer. Maybe if they extended themselves outside of their inner circle, they can get more revenue.

Worst America's Taco Shop location I've been to. I typically go to the 7th St. and McDowell location. My burrito came out incorrectly, and it's just beans and cheese. The service was horrible. The staff whistled at us to let us know our burritos were ready despite the fact that (a) they gave us a number and (b) we were literally a foot away.

Super helpful and nice. I had no idea what I wanted or what I was looking for. Someone helped me pick a good flavor for 30 or so minutes. I hear that organic juice exists for the vapes, and if it does, I hope they carry it. I enjoy getting my products there.

Super cool company. My mom's garbage disposal needed to be repaired. Tinker Plumbing wasn't the lowest bid, but they came on time, explained everything clearly, found and fixed the problem, and cleaned up after.
