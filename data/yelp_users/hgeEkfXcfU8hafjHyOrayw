I've been coming to this nail salon for awhile now and it never disappoints! The staff is friendly and helpful and I have never left upset with my experience. I love it!

Not pleased. I've lived here for 3 months and I am sorely disappointed. Initially, Dorsey Place seemed like a good choice; nice apartments, great location, and friendly staff. Oh, was I wrong! From the beginning, the staff couldn't figure out how to spell my name, which resulted in constant miscommunication. It took a minimum of three phone calls to solve that issue. After we moved in, we had a host of complaints that weren't addressed until very recently including a broken back door, a broken fridge, and chipping paint. They advertise that you can pay your rent online, however that is not true. I tried doing so and thought that my troubles with Dorsey Place were over. Nope. They never charged my bank and returned my payment. They ended up charging me a $50 fee for insufficient funds (which was not accurate) and threatened to take me to court, although I had received no summons. All in all, this place has it out for you. They're looking for young, college kids who don't know much about renting apartments and are looking to commit fraud against them. If you're thinking of renting here, keep looking. Not worth it.

This place is amazing! They were the only shop who would still my sister and I, even though we got a late start on Friday the 13th. The staff was super friendly, especially since we had to wait due to the popularity of the event. I was tattooed by Wyatt, who was a dream! He was so fun to talk to and did an awesome job-I'm so happy! I can't wait to head back to get more ink!
