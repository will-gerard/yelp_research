These are really good donuts! Fast service and lots of choices.  Bought a couple of dozen donuts for my co-workers and they loved them as well. My favorite was the plain glazed donut. It was so fluffy! They were all fresh. My only complaint was the bacon donut, I noticed in the pictures that some have bacon "sprinkles" were the bacon looks real and crispy but in little tiny pieces and then some just have 4 pieces of bacon placed on top.  Yeah, I didn't care for the one topped with 4 pieces of bacon and that is all they had. I will continue to come here and see if I get lucky!

Let me start off with a complaint, it was super cold in there. Luckily, my office is just as cold and I had a sweater with me. Mujer precavida vale por dos.  My coworkers and I visited this place as part of our weekly lunch date. I suggested the place based on the Yelp reviews. I bet I will win employee of the month just for this.  We all had the tomato, basil, mozzarella sandwich.  We all fell in love with it.  A couple who was seated next to us complimented our plate cleaning abilities.  The servers were attentive and if you are a fan of Ryan Gosling, you get to see his twin serve your lunch and refill your water, I was really thirsty for some reason.

I love, love, love Pane Bianco. I have become nearly addicted, I have only had the mozzarella and basil sandwich, I don't know if I will ever get past the love of that sandwich. I mainly take out from there and sometimes eat outside, the guys who work there are amazing.

I like to stop at this Safeway on my way home to get dinner on Friday nights. This store is clean, has a good selection of alcohol, vegetables and desserts. They have a Monopoly game going on right now, which has me going to Safeway more than I usually do. There is always a parking spot near the door and the lines to pay are not too long, plus they have 4 self check out kiosks.

Came across this place while running errands in Mesa. I had promised my daughter I would buy her ice cream after her shots. We walked in and ordered a banana split for her, I'm a weird person that doesn't love ice cream and ice cream doesn't love me back but I will still have a couple of spoonfuls.   We ordered from a really nice young man and received our treat quite fast.  Will go back to try a concrete soon.

NO! Do you want a bagel? Do you really want one? Ok, since you insist, there is a trader joes, a fry's and a Walmart nearby. Pick one of those places and buy yourself some bagels.  Just don't come here, they don't deserve you.  The service will be horrible. They will take a long time to take your order, even longer to make your food, and you will stand there waiting for your food wondering how there can be 6 employees behind the line with no other orders ahead of you and it's been 15 minutes and you still have no food.  Once you finally receive your food, you will leave ASAP because you can't stand the incompetence and also you want to eat in a place that does not look like a high school cafeteria after a food fight.  When you get home, your order will be wrong. You have been warned.

It took a year from the time I moved to Gilbert for me to finally visit this restaurant. My only regret is not coming sooner. We visited on a wednesday night and were surprised to see that the restaurant was almost full. We ordered from the nice cashier and signed our ticket with one of their very cool "spoon-fork" pens.   The FOOD:   I ordered the cobb salad with no egg. The salad was delicious, crisp greens, perfect combination of chicken, bacon, avocado and lots of blue cheese! They offer a choice of blue cheese dressing and balsamic. I like a mix of both and they were nice enough to accommodate yet another special request from me.   My daughter had their Best Chicken sandwich. Of course in my house I have a rule, I have to try everyones food so I can write a Yelp review that is accurate. So I had a couple of bites of her sandwich and it was delicious, perfect combination of all delicious juicy chicken breast with melted Monterrey jack cheese and that heavenly avocado spread, I almost didn't want to give her sandwich back.  My son had the burger special of the week: The Ruben Burger. Oh my, what deliciousness! This teenager of mine, who normally would just inhale a food he likes or refuse to eat it if it "looks weird" declared that he was going to eat this burger slowly, because  since it was a special, he wasn't sure he could have it next time we come here.  I had to sneak a bite when he got up to refill his drink and then of course the other mandatory bite for the yelp review.   THE REST  The ambiance is great, the decor of the place is amazing, the bathrooms are cool, a little awkward if you are not used to co-ed bathrooms in a restaurant and all their employees were nice and friendly.   I will make sure not a month goes by without making a second visit to them!

It would be totally unfair to you my fellow yelper, if I didn't update this review to tell you more about Liberty Market every time I visit, even if it has been less than a month since I've been here last.  I had a friend visiting from out of town and I would not be the hostess with the mostess unless I brought her to Liberty Market.  It was a busy saturday night, there was a long line, we were hungry and thirsty. We quickly made it to the back of the line and started looking at a menu. The hardest part about eating here is deciding what you will eat.   A seating host came by, asked us if we wanted to seat inside or outside, once we told him he gave us a card with a number and said he would go and find us a table. We quickly got to the cashier and ordered our food. White pizza and the Picnic Salad, the cashier asked if we would be sharing the salad and offered(anticipating our needs, whaaaaaat?) to split the salad for us. We also ordered some drinks from the bar. Once we had our water we headed to the outside area and there was our table! Great system to assign tables! Once we sat down our drinks were delivered so fast you'd think they were delivered by jimmy johns. The drinks were delicious and very refreshing.  Once the pizza arrived and my friend the avid instagrammer took pictures of the food, we were in heaven. This pizza is so good, it is making my mouth water. I am in love with Liberty Market.

Five stars for the young men(I didn't see any girls, but I'm sure they are just as good) that work at this location! We stopped by on a Sunday night looking for ice cream cones and ice cream cones we got. They were friendly, fast and had a smile on their faces.

One of the best breakfast spot in Gilbert! This place has it all, the charm, the exceptional service and the delicious food. My son and I stopped in for breakfast last Saturday, waited about 10 minutes to be called after putting our name down. There is no room to wait outside but they have some benches and misters outside (which is greatly appreciated).  The service was great, we had a waitress that was efficient, multiple people visited our table, to top off water or remove plates and the food was delivered hot and all at the same time. My son raved about their breakfast sandwich. Sourdough bread, over medium egg, bacon, lettuce and tomato. He also ordered chocolate milk, which was served in an ice cold mug. I had to try it, to report to you that is, and because, well it was served in an ice cold mug and that reminded me of beer. It was delicious.  I ordered the home potatoes, a ham steak and some tomatoes. The ham steak was perfect, not too salty and not overcooked. Finally we had a cinnamon roll, and oh my, that was one of the best I have ever had.

I haven't bought a gun from this establishment but I did sell them one and was very happy with the process. I walked in later in the day and asked if they would buy a gun. They didn't ask any stupid questions like they did in other establishments:  "this is yours?" "you were able to shoot this?" "why didn't get a smaller caliber gun?" They just asked why I was selling it, I explained why and that was it. This is a no nonsense shop, the gentlemen that work here are knowledgeable and respectful, we discussed which gun would be best for my needs in the future when I am ready to buy again and I will be happy to make my purchase here.

This is such a nice breakfast spot in the east valley area. With the number of chains and new fancy breakfast spots open and opening around the Gilbert/Chandler area, sometimes you just want a simple yet delicious restaurant that's down to earth, Hoosier cafe is such place.   I have been here a few times on the weekends and there is always a wait, typically 15-30 minutes but they tend to call you faster than the quoted time. The servers I have had have all been really nice and efficient, your cup will rarely be empty.   I love their pancakes, seriously, I am not a big breakfast food person but these pancakes are so delicious and actually make me crave them. Bacon is also really good here, well bacon is good anywhere.

I love it! The best fried rice I have had in a long time! They are nice enough to make me rice without eggs! Their lunch specials are a great deal! I usually have enough left over for lunch the next day. Most employees are friendly and they are really fast at getting your food out, it is served in togo containers, which is a great idea!

I am so excited to have found this place thanks to Yelp! One of the greatest pleasures in life is being able to eat a torta ahogada. Its spicy, to the point that your face will feel tingly and you start sweating, yet you can't stop eating it. Filled with delicious pierna (pork leg) and covered in a super spicy but also super delicious sauce all inside a roll that is crusty outside but soft on the inside. If you are not into self torture, as my kids describe my love for the torta ahogada, they have many other foods that are equally delicious. Torta de Milanesa, burritos, enchiladas, caldos breakfast and many more things. Don't be discouraged by the appearance of the place. The owners and all the employees are very friendly and kind. Also, skip the chips and salsa and order an empanada as an appetizer.

I've been using Super Shuttle for all my to/from the airport travel. Most drivers I have encountered were friendly and efficient. Had 2 drivers who had somewhat of an attitude, but not as bad as a taxi driver. They will send you a text message when your plane lands with instructions on how to do a mobile check in, once checked in you are given instructions on which area to go and wait for the shuttle. The pick up time is fairly quick, you usually ride with 2 or more passengers. Many times they are cheaper than a taxi and even Über.

My friend loved their quiche. For her sake I am giving 2 stars. My food was cold, we waited almost 45 minutes to receive our food.  Our server looked lost. You know when you go out the night before and the next day you go to work and no matter how much you try to focus you just can't. That was our server. The owner was nice, but the food wasn't coming out, and rather than visiting tables, I would expect her to be lighting a fire under the cooks butts or cooking herself and also letting the tables know why it was taking so long. Finally when our food came, my daughter's pancakes were not ready and we had almost finished our food by the time her pancakes were brought to the table. We tried to order the cinnamon roll, but they were out of them.

I am a huge procrastinator, I also hate going to Dr's, not because I am scared, but because I dislike the process and what it has turned into. You are seen by a receptionist, a medical assistant, a PA or RNP and you rarely get to see an actual Dr but end up paying Dr rates for. So I put off finding a family Dr in the Phoenix metro area and crossed my fingers we didn't get sick (huge mistake and also very irresponsible on my part) and of course one of those times I was sick enough that I needed to find a Dr that could tell me what was wrong.   So I went to this urgent care, I called before to make sure the wait wasn't too long and to see if they took my insurance, they said no wait and yes to my insurance.  I walked in, was not greeted by the receptionist who apparantly had better things to do then, you know, be a receptionist, when she finally finished doing those other receptionist things, she acknowledged me and handed me some forms to fill up.  I turned in my forms and waited about 40 minutes to finally be called in, there was one other patient in the waiting area. Once I was called, by what I am assuming is a medical assistant (who needed to wash her scrubs), she asked me about my symptoms, made her notes, asked me to pee on a cup and wait in a room. Then a PA came in along with a person who I assumed was either the trainer or the trainee, not sure, and it doesn't matter. The PA examined me, and told me what was wrong with me, there was no bedside manners and they both looked like it was awkward for them to examine me.Once they were finished i was told to go to the front to be checked out. At the front I was told this is your prescription and it will be $15.00 for it, I was given a Dr's note after I asked for it a second time. Only once I got home did I realized the "Dr" failed to sign it.  So aside from being less than friendly and having a wait time that was not what was quoted 10 minutes before I got there, I also have a huge issue with the way they handled the prescription situation. With my insurance, I pay a $5.00 copay for most medications, the medication they prescribed and filled without my authorization being one of them. Had I not been sick, I would have questioned that, but I was sick and wanted to go home back to bed. To some this may only be $10 and worth it for the convenience, but I would like to be the one to choose who fills my prescription.

There was a time in my life when I would not dare step food in a buffet. Buffets were not places I would spend my money. Well, life has a way of making you change your ways and for me, making me change the places I can afford to eat at. This buffet isn't specifically a cheap buffet, but it is a good deal for the selections offered. They have a wide array of choices. I wasn't too fond of their nigiri sushi but it was comparable to some sushi joints out there and I am not even talking of the AYCE restaurants. The roll selection was decent, they had spicy tuna roll, and I was surprised by how good it was. They have a BBQ section that I didn't get to try but looked really delicious! Also they had a lot of dim sum selections which I had not seen at a buffet before, they also had your typical chinese buffet standards. I liked the fact that like their name states, they are indeed a seafood buffet! Lots of different fish options! I would invite you to give it a try!

I wish the budget allowed me to shop at Costco every weekend! I wish I could get all my groceries from Costco! This Costco is awesome, it is never too packed, they have good prices and carry most of the items I need. I stopped at a Tempe Costco recently and I now appreciate this Costco location even more.

Food options around my workplace are plentiful. Some are awesome, some are meh. Thanks to yelp I found this hidden gem and I am extremely happy about it.  So far I have had a rueben sandwich, an asian chicken salad and a burger here. The rueben was really good and so was the burger. The salads here are meh, I had a Greek salad that had 4 pieces of tomato and 4 cucumber slices, stay away from the greens and stick to the sandwiches. The owners are nice and no nonsense. They have a great little place here.

I came here for the Sonoran hot dogs, which are pretty yummy. Not El Guero Canelo yummy, but good enough to hold off the craving until the next trip to Tucson. I also ordered the carne asada torta, that was muy buena ijuesu!  They have Mexican soda in bottles. Ample parking and friendly cashiers. If you are even in that area of Chandler, stop by for a quick lunch.

Why am I reviewing a McDonalds? Because I have to tell you about how awesome the employees at this specific location are!   I normally go there during lunch or in the morning, they are always courteous and they get the orders out really fast.   Recently, on what can only be described as the world telling me to go screw myself, I had locked my car keys in my office, only to realize it when I was at the park and ride in Tempe after taking the 45 minute light rail trip, having to go back to my office, where the alarm was activated which meant no access, to having a dead cell phone and a debit card sitting comfortably at home, I had to walk to a nearby walgreens and purchase an 18 dollar phone charger. The girl at the walgreens said they couldn't plug my phone to an outlet to charge. At this point it is dark outside, and I can't even remember the phone number of anyone that lives in this city to come and pick me up.  So I am walking alone on central avenue at 7:30 at night and I make it to this mcdonalds, and I ask if they will charge my phone for me and they do! I might as well eat dinner, so i order off the value menu and get my food. While I'm sitting there wondering what in the world I did before smart phones. Talk to strangers that's what.  After a nice conversation with a woman who was eating her dinner before going to work, I was handed a milkshake that had to be remade because the customer asked for no whipped cream, the girl said I should have it because I was having such a bad night.   So thank you MCDonald's employees, I will visit this location even is its just to buy an iced tea and I will forever be grateful!

CLOSED! This McDonalds has closed. Gone are the days when I used to conveniently walk here from work to pick up a drink on my break or get some coffee in the morning. Apparently the sales at this restaurant were not enough so it moved to a new location in a more centrally located area with easier access for customers. Funny thing is I still see people try to go through the drive-tru and park to go into the restaurant.

My child was starving after a dentist visit, so we waited the requisite 30 minutes,   and then off we were to Steve's Krazy Subs. We had never been here before and thought it would be a good idea to try this instead of the big chains.  In every city I have lived, there is always that one place were the service is awful, yet the food is so good, you are happy to put up with crappy service, well turn around and keep looking because this is not that place.  When I was ready to order, I looked at the teenage boy and said Hi! He glared. I placed my order. He told me the total and I handed him my credit card. He ran it and gave me a receipt, so I asked if he needed my signature since this was a credit transaction. He said no and stuffed the receipt in the register and slammed it shut.  The only friendly person there was the girl who handed me our food.  I don't know if this kid was having a bad day or what was going on for him to be so rude to us, but I do know I am not coming back.

I had an emergency and needed to see an eye doctor as soon as I could. Luckily when I called they were able to fit me in the same day. The Dr saw me as soon as I got there and listened to my concern regarding my previous prescription(from a different place) and took the time to make sure I had the right prescription. They had my contacts ready in no time, I went to pick them up and was happy with their service. Only issue is the place is small and kind of cluttered in the back are.

I am a bad car owner, I have been letting my car go and not keeping up with the maintenance as I should. I realized I had to get an oil change 5,000 miles after it was due and I was lucky to spot this shop driving down the street. They quoted me a reasonable time and had my car ready within that time. I asked for some things to be looked at and they did a great job at explaining to me what was and wasn't wrong with my car. When I got in my car, I did not have to re-adjust my seat to its right position, they did it for me! The price for an oil change was amazing! I have found my new car mechanic!

This guy is awesome! I took in my son's baritone to have some minor repairs done and I was very happy that he was able to do them while I waited and at a reasonable price. No complaints, will go here for any other repairs that my son's instrument needs.

I love Famous Dave's and have loved it for a very long time!  My favorites are their lunch combos and the big meal served in a trash can lid.  You get a little bit of everything and can share with the family.  Another plus for this restaurant is I have never encountered a rude or unfriendly server.

I took a gamble and I lost. I used Hotwire to find a room with a kitchenette around the Mesa area and this is what I ended up with.  I tried to stay positive, I only need to stay here for 6 nights. Only 6 nights.  The day we got there the front desk person informed me that since I had purchased through a third party, they would be putting a $100.00 hold on my credit card. They have a sign at the front that tells you this.   I was staying here until my new rental was ready for move in.     The day I checked in, my family and I had been packing the truck and we were exhausted and needed somewhere to cool down(remember this).We also had to unpack the things we would keep in the hotel.     I rented a 2 bed suite that had a separate living area. The living room had one couch, side table, desk and flat screen tv. The same room held a kitchenette with a "full size refrigerator" and range with an oven.   This refrigerator was so old, it had that metal plate inside that frosts to keep things cool.    One of the reasons I wanted a kitchenette is so I didn't have to go out to eat everyday and I could cook. I have stayed at hotels that have kitchens before and they always have dishes, pots and pans. Not this hotel. You get what you pay for.      The room smelled strongly of cigarette.  The wall AC unit would not cool the living area. It was so hot in that room! I literally wanted to go and rent another hotel and let them keep the money I had already paid.  Get this, the wall AC unit was THE ONLY ONE in the room. The bedroom and bathroom area did not have one and the rooms were divided by a wall with one door. Worst off the AC did not work or cool. It was hell!   The beds were comfortable, hence the 2 stars.  The bathroom was clean but old and needed a lot of work. Taking a shower in the bathroom was like being in a hot sauna. The extractor was not working only making a humming noise. Trying to put on jeans in that bathroom was a workout.   On the first night my cousin said he would sleep in the pull out couch, against my warning, and when he pulled out the couch there was this huge giant reddish brown stain on it we quickly put it away. DISGUSTING. Walking barefoot on hotel carpet is agains the rules for us, my cousin did not know this and his feet were black with dirt from the disgusting carpet.  On day 3, at 3 am my son wakes me up to tell me the bathroom was overflowing. KILL ME NOW.   Shut off valve is broken.   I call the front desk and the guy tells me he can call maintenance or give me another room. If he calls maintenance, they will take a long time to come. Ok, I take the other room.   I go to the front desk and the guy tells me I need to give him the keys to the old room before he will give me the keys to the new room. I asked him to confirm what he is saying, because I cannot believe it. He confirms. I tried to remain calm and explain to him that I have my children with me, we are staying there for 6 days and have all our stuff to move, what does he think I'm going to do with it.   He repeats the same thing.   Now I'm leaving the calm stage. I tell him I'm not putting my things on the sidewalk and that he will give me the keys to the new room and once I inspect the new room and move everything I will walk back there and give him the keys to the old room. He looks at me and starts talking. I turn into a rude customer and interrupt him. I demand to have the keys. They have my credit card on file. Think I'm going to occupy 2 rooms? Charge me. He gives me the new keys, tells me to make sure I get the old ones back to him. *glares*   The bathroom flooding turns out to be a blessing in disguise! This new room smells fresh, has a working AC unit that actually cools the living area and make the bedroom area feel ok. We no longer need to use the fans I bought on our first day there to keep us cool. The bathroom has a working extractor and it is cleaner and newer. The couch looks newer and so does the carpet. Everything is so much better in this room. Our last 3 nights there are not as bad.   I still would not recommend you staying here unless you are really low on funds.

El Súper is really far away from my house, but close to work and I will stop by every now and then to get some pan dulce.   The pan dulce stop always turns into a fruits and vegetable stop. I ask find myself going through the aisles and buying other items that I don't normally find at regular grocery stores or that are cheaper here like lechera, chocolate abuelita, café and so much more.   They have a wall section near the entrance that has a lot of cooking utensils that are used in traditional Mexican cooking, if you are looking for a corn tortilla press, a lime squeezer, or a olla for los tamales, then this is the place to go!  Last visit there was to get a Rosca de Reyes (King's Wreath) on Jan 6th. The tradition in Mexico is to share with your family/friends a king's wreath, a baby Jesus figurine is usually inside the wreath, whoever gets the figurine has to make tamales for the family/friends on Feb 2nd.   The roscas at El Súper had very good flavor, not a fan of the raisins inside the bread but I picked those off. The baby Jesus figurines were outside the wreath and I guess you have to insert them before cutting. Probably to avoid a lawsuit.   Cashiers are mostly friendly but not always.

The commercials are no joke! These guys are fast! The sandwiches are delicious, the employees there are friendly and keep the restaurant pretty clean. I had just finished swiping my debit card when BAAM my sandwiches were ready! The fact that they are so fast doesn't mean your sandwich will be wrong or lacking ingredients! Oh and yes, they are really yummy!

After many, many failed attempts to come to the library and get a library card, mostly due to my poor planning, we finally made it! I was pretty spoiled when it comes to libraries because of the Frisco, TX library which was amazing, and I am happy to report, just in case you were loosing sleep over it, that this library comes pretty close.  The library is good in size, clean and well organized. Employees are courteous and friendly. There is a separate section that has the children's and teenage area. They have a good amount of computer stations and plenty of tables plus private rooms.  Definitely a good place to come with your children or even by yourself to spend a nice afternoon.

I love my car. I may not give it the love it deserves, but I truly love my car.  Recently I have had to do some maintenance repairs to it and having moved so much in the last 4 years has made it difficult to stick to one mechanic. Seems every time I find a go to guy I end up moving away. In the spirit of saving some money I went back to my hometown of Douglas, AZ to have some repairs done which I was quoted in Gilbert and were more than my wallet could shell out. Well, turns out "lo barato sale caro" (cheap ends up costing you more) and the shop in Douglas couldn't do all the services I needed, after I had already paid them the money to order the parts and waited 2 days to have my car fixed.   So I drove back to Gilbert somewhat defeated and wondering what I would do with those car parts in the trunk of my car. I looked online for a week or so and kept coming across reviews for Highline Import Auto. I was skeptical because most reviews were from yelpers that had few reviews and also almost everyone referred to the owner by name. There were a few reviews from established yelpers (at least 20 reviews in my book) and a couple of ELITES, so I decided to call them and give them a try. Here is why they deserve 5 stars:  They were able to get me in the same day I called and use the part I had previously purchased at the other shop. They knew exactly what I was there for the minute I walked in (no need to explain again) They called me within an hour to tell me what the car needed done, and not only that but they were able to tell me what was causing the problem and what needed to be done to avoid future problems. They had my car ready in reasonable time. The price was, in my opinion, fair. When I picked up the car, it looked cleaner than it did when I dropped it off, no grease stains on my door or even worse on my steering wheel and maybe they vacuumed it? The problem I was having has disappeared. The car is running great!  I would highly recommend these guys! I dealt mostly with an older gentleman who was very professional and helpful. I met the owner Wes when I went to pick up my car and he was very nice, so now I get why all the name dropping on other yelper's review.

December for me means you will eat tamales, lots and lots of tamales. You will get tamales from your mother, your friends at work and you will even make your own.  I needed a break from tamales, and being too lazy to drive to the regular sushi place we decided to try this place.     The service was great , at first it was a little rushed but considering he was the only server there with quite a few tables he did a great job.   We started off with a tuna and avocado salad which was delicious! It would be perfect for lunch. We also had some nigiri salmon, which is my daughter's favorite sushi item.   We also had the What the Heck roll and another roll that had cooked salmon on top. The rolls were good, but I wouldn't order the cooked salmon roll again, stick with the raw fish.  One thing I noticed and was great full for at this bar is that they do not stuff all their rolls with imitation crab meat in the middle. I really dislike imitation crab meat and I dislike the was some sushi places have opted to include it in all their rolls.   Give this place a try!

McQueen Park is very close to my home. When I first moved to Arizona, we were driving around the new neighborhood and found this park, went and got some Los Favoritos and had a picnic here.   Now we go there to walk the dog, sometimes we go and watch the baseball games. It's fun to see little kids enjoy the game and sometimes it's fun to see how invested the parents are in their kids game, other times it's scary.   The grounds are nicely kept, they have a few "Ramadas" for parties, restrooms, tennis courts, basketball courts and 2 volleyball courts. The park also has an activities center which doubles as a voting post. I have never attended a class there, so I can't comment on that.   The park also has a lake, and 3 ramadas next to it. I have seen some people fishing there. It is  nice to walk there after work and watch the sunset.

I lose things. Usually I lose my keys, an important piece of paper, my driver's license and my debit card. I have lost my debit card so many times I have lost count (notice a trend here)? This helps my children's argument that I am old. Last time I lost my debit card at a Circle K in Tucson, the employee at the gas station where I left it decided she was going to have an early christmas. She charged $800.00 worth of gas to my card. Every cash transaction was charged to my card and she pocketed the money. Until my bank canceled the card and notified me.  So this time around, I stopped at this gas station, pumped gas and paid for it at the pump. Once I was done I walked over to use their very clean restrooms. I was going to get some snacks like I usually do when I stop here but I figured Tucson is not that much of a drive and I could wait to eat something there.  Once in Tucson, I was out shopping with my family and realized my debit card was missing amidst the eye rolling of my daughter. Oops, I did it again.  I looked in my purse and in my car, I thought it was gone until upon returning to Gilbert I decided maybe, just maybe, I dropped it at the gas station.   Once there, the guy quickly looked in a drawer and found it. He looked at the picture on my card and said this is you! Which made me wonder if this guy will marry me. The picture is 12 years old and well, I was 20 when it was taken. Much better looking me back then.  Amazed! They have great gas prices, they have clean bathrooms, they have a well stocked store and very friendly employees who above all are honest! Thank you Quick Trip! You guys rock!

Came here on a weekday with my kids. We had been wanting to try this place for a while and were pleasantly surprised. The server was really nice, very efficient and personable. She brought our appetizer of spring rolls. We loved them, they came with the traditional peanut sauce, not overly stuffed with greens so that you can't taste the shrimp and pork.   For dinner my son ordered the fried rice and was very happy with the flavor, it was different than most fried rice he has tried but he really liked it. (He likes to stick to one thing only) I had the thai basil chicken. It was very delicious, I loved it! In fact I ate most of the chicken and still had a lot of onions and peppers that I gladly ate the next day over rice.  My daughter ordered the Orange Chicken. Now, if you are expecting this to be a heavily breaded, overly sweet orange chicken, you shouldn't order this dish. Go to panda express instead. The chicken is thin, it is crispy and the orange sauce tastes like orange without being overwhelmingly sweet. My daughter and I loved it.   The service was great, prices are very reasonable and the inside of the restaurant is clean.

Of all the raspado places in town I have tried, Tropical Snowflake Raspados is the best. Located in a mostly empty and dated strip mall on 32nd st, north of McDowell, Tropical Snowflake Raspados is a small, but clean establishment that will surprise your taste buds.  They have many snacks to choose from, I get their mangoneadas, which are the top! Instead of using ice and adding mango syrup, they use frozen mango and fresh mango pieces to the top, plus some other tamarind candy treats!  I also tried their duros preparados. These were really good and could make  decent lunch.   They also have ice cream and aguas, plus other sweet treats you will enjoy. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed.

When I moved back to Arizona after living in Texas for a few years, I was ecstatic, overjoyed, couldn't contain my happiness! That is until I had to go grocery shopping, then I missed Texas just a bit. You see in Texas I lived less than a mile away from a beauty of a store called Aldi. I had the grocery shopping down, most staples at Aldi, a monthly Costco visit and then a Kroger and Tom Thumb every 2 weeks. Coming back to AZ I had to start all over, with the  visits to Walmart, Fry's and Safeway but not really happy with the prices or quality of their store brands. I still missed Aldi's bargain prices, the amazing quality of their store brand products and how super fast their cashiers were.   Where was I? WinCo. Yes, this review is for WInCo.   I drove by WinCo on a trip to Chuck e Cheese, so I made a mental note to visit. The first time I was there I was extremely happy! Now I have become a "regular" and since they have two stores close to me I try to alternate between the Mesa and the Gilbert store.   The Gilbert store is much bigger, but they are both equally clean. They have some weeks were prices are not as discounted on my favorite items, but they are still low enough that they beat competitors prices.  They will not bag your groceries, they will not help you take them to your car, but they compensate in their prices. I can bag my own groceries.

Growing up in Mexico raspados were a typical summer treat. I lived in a small town and we bought our raspados from whatever neighborhood lady took in the entrepreneurial spirit that summer and decided to make some extra money by selling them out of her home. The raspados of my childhood involved shaved ice with syrup. They were simple but delicious.   Now raspados have evolved into a delicious combination of shaved ice and anything you can top it off with. I have been pretty skeptical of this new(er) trend and have continued to order a good old fashioned raspado in those rare occasions that I have one.  I went into this shop and bought a medium sized (that made Starbuck's Venti size look ridiculous for something other than the name) Diablito. The Diablito is a delicious combination of shaved ice, mango syrup, mango slices, chamoy, different types of tamarindo candy and what is known in Mexico as Japanese peanuts.   Well, my dear yelpers, I am changed woman. I will never look at a traditional raspado with the same eyes. I had an experience that made me pull over on the side of the road after I started driving just so I could eat it and not place other drivers in harms way. That's how freaking good this raspado was. You have to try it!   Aside from the raspados they also tortas and other food items but I did not have any or pay much attention to that portion of the menu, I will definitely be back soon to try another Diablito and some of the food they have to offer.

Bahama Bucks has something called a mocha java which I imagined to be a coffee flavored shaved ice. It wasn't. It was more like the cup of coffee my grandmother would make for me when I was a child. A cup of milk with a splash of coffee and way too much sugar. I didn't care for it one bit.  Other flavors we have tried were the wedding cake, birthday cake and mango flavors, those were all really good. Service is very friendly and efficient.

For the first time in my life I left a sushi restaurant without eating all my food.  We don't go out to eat sushi too often because of the cost and when we do it's a special treat. We wasted our money tonight.  We sat at a table and were provided with menus, the menu is full of pictures. I read the menu many times and couldn't find nigiri sushi in it. Figured I could just order it and we did.  Note, this restaurant does not or at least did not give us, the slip of paper where you write down what you are ordering, by the time the server came I had forgotten some of the things we wanted to order.  We ordered Gyoza to start, when it came out I was surprised to see some of the wrappers were green. The menu just said they were Japanese Dumplings. Having ordered and made Gyoza many times I was surprised when I realized we got 3 vegetable and 3 pork Gyoza. I would be nice if the menu clarified this, didn't care for the flavor of the vegetable ones and the pork ones were bland, the accompanying ponzu sauce was watered down and did not taste anything like ponzu. Fail.             We also ordered nigiri salmon and that was really good. Great! The rolls we ordered were blah, spicy tuna was sweet and then spicy and was just not good. The lobster roll was a big mistake, not sure why I would even order something like this. Fail on me.  Now, I'd like to take a minute to comment on the service. When our gyoza came out, she asked us in a very condescending tone "oh you are splitting?" Well, it's an appetizer, yes we are splitting.  Once the rolls and nigiri were brought out, we didn't see our server again. I had ordered hot tea and was pretty much out and needed a refill. I put my cup at the end of the table and waited until we could see someone to get their attention. Once the server came to our table, she looked at my daughter's half empty coke and told her she would be bringing a refill. I didn't have an opportunity to even ask her for another tea. Now I know servers don't read minds, but if you see someone's cup at the edge of the table it has to mean something. Does this cup need to be cleared, does this persone need more tea? Something!  When she brought the coke I was done eating and just needed for my daughter to finish her food. I was over my need for tea.  We sat and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally we stood up and went to the front  desk and our server finally came. She asked us if the food was ok, we wanted to get out and said yeah. Liars, I know.  She gave me a total, not an itemized bill. Just a total. I could very well have asked for one, but I was tired and had given up on this restaurant. There are things that you shouldn't have to ask for. An itemized bill is one of them. I gave the server my credit card and she gave me the receipts to sign and one to keep, nowhere was the tally of the items i ordered. While I was signing it, it came to me that this would be the first time I was not going to leave a tip. I just couldn't do it. Service and food was crappy. I should have known when we got there at 6:30 pm on a Saturday night and at the most, they had 5 tables.

It has been a while since this company, hired by my former landlord, came to my home to clean my carpet as a result of a water leak. It was a relatively small area that they cleaned but they were amazing! The carpet looked great, there was no residual smell. They came to check on it often and left the carpet looking and smelling clean. The techs were so respectful and helpful, they left a great impression and I recommend using them.  A year after, my apartment flooded again (upstairs neighbors)  and the owners used a different company, I kept insisting on having Citrus Bright do it but the new owners refused, that's a different review but it made me appreciate Citrus Bright so much more.

Winco has two other locations in the east valley and this one is my favorite so far.  I went there today for their grand opening and was very happy to see their store was clean and well stocked. They sent a mailer with coupons for free cake, brownie and frosting mix and they had plenty of those left around 4:30 pm!  I love shopping their bulk foods section, you can always find those rare items for great prices. Having Winco so close by is great, now I can get all my groceries and don't have to make the long drive to San Tan area or east Mesa. Just like at other Winco stores you will have to bag your own groceries, but it's worth it for the prices!

I was treated to lunch here as an early birthday lunch from a friend in February. We were excited to come here because we had been to the Tucson location a few years back and loved it.   Well I was very disappointed.  The wait times for the restaurant during lunch seemed unacceptable to me. There were tables open while we were waiting. That usually means the restaurant was not properly staffed, which translates into poor management.  The food needs a lot of work. The burgers were so "juicy", and not in a good way, the bottom roll was soaked to the point where picking up the burger was impossible and the nice flavor I remember from the Tucson location was nowhere to be found. The food also came out to lukewarm. Maybe sat in the window far too long?  Best thing were the zucchini fries, we loved those. The restaurant has a very nice appearance and they did a great job decorating , I hope they can fix the other issues soon.

We came here on a late Thursday night after a concert at the Marquee. This place is a wide open space with high ceilings, didn't look at the decor too much because I was tired, hungry and really wanted to go home.  Out server was nice, but he was way too "attentive", this was our first time there and while having a server explain the menu is what most people prefer, my friend and I just want to be given time to read it ourselves. He kept stopping by which made it harder to concentrate and it became somewhat annoying. Maybe he was new or we were his last table and he wanted to get our order in quickly. Once we ordered he pretty much left us alone and we enjoyed our time there.  We shared the grilled cheese sliders and the seared tuna salad. The sliders look more impressive than they taste and we only ate one each. The salad was something else! It is probably one of the most delicious salads I have ever had. Just typing this makes me want to drive down there and have one for dinner. Definitely give this place a try!

Picante. Everything here is Picante in some way or another. For me that's a good thing, for other people, maybe not so much. The pollo was picante, the beans were picante, the cold pasta salad was picante. The fresh salad, rice and tortillas were not. I stopped by on a Wednesday night and they had a buy one (either half off or free, don't remember I am old). I bought the deal along with a cold 2 liter coke, which is a great deal for the price I paid. You want to know how much? I don't remember...  The chicken was delicious and had great flavor. One of the chickens was a tad bit dry but we still enjoyed it. The beans, cold salad and salsa were also great. Their red rice was so bland, i let my kids eat all of it.   The place is small and clean. The girls working that afternoon were super nice and helpful.
