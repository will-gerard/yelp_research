I love "hole in the wall" restaurants. This place has great decor, cozy feel, and great staff. Their menu has items to please all palettes.

I had an appointment set for 5pm, and they arrived right on time. Justin and Dax cleaned our fireplace and did it quickly and neatly. Both are real friendly, customer service was top notch. I will be using them for all our fireplace needs. I highly recommend this company.

It's tough to find good non cafeteria-style Filipino restaurants, and this one definitely impressed. Had to have Kare Kare (my all-time favorite dish) and Lechon Kawale. Very, very good. Had some halo halo, of course, and I gotta say the best part was the leche flan. Had to grab some cheese rolls to take home.   Service was friendly and we'll definitely return.

It was good. There were a variety of options to choose from. In a great location and easy to find. Wasn't blown away, though.

There's a reason why this place has 355 near perfect reviews. On our first visit, I had the Santa Fe and my wife had the Cali burger. Both were excellent. We shared a basket of fries that were cut in-house. This is the quintessential hole-in-the-wall spot. If you're in the area, this is a must try.

We came for restaurant week. First off, the decor was great. Love the bar and the open kitchen. It was a Saturday, so there was live music playing outside, but we could hear the performance from inside. I had the pork belly dish, while my wife enjoyed the beef shoulder. Both dishes were excellent. We both had a couple well-made cocktails. Their Moscow mules were refreshing. If you're an Old Fashioned fan like myself, try their Salty Sow'r.

Came here with my wife for a Sunday breakfast. Very close to where we live. Service was very friendly and the food was delicious. I had the corned beef hash and my wife had the 2 eggs your way with pancakes. Nice, modern decor and friendly atmosphere.

Came here with my wife for Restaurant Week. Beautiful building, this place is great for everything from first dates to anniversaries or just somewhere to have a drink. Very attentive service, great quality of food. We thoroughly enjoyed our first experience here. No doubt we'll be back again.

Came to this place with my wife. The location was good, decor and atmosphere was relaxing. The menu offerings were to our liking; we're very adventurous and the Asian fusion fits our palates well. Check out their happy hour. Great prices and they offer it every day. We'll be back again for sure.

Don't be fooled by the posts about having a dog friendly patio. I came with my wife and our dog and asked how long the wait would be for patio seating and that we had our dog with us. First, the hostess stated there was another dog on the patio, to which I asked if there were rules about having multiple dogs on the patio. Then, a gentleman asked if our dog was a service dog. I told him he was not, and the gentleman said that they only allow service dogs. Hmmm, that's not what the posts on Yelp say. I laughed on my way out the door. Needless to say, I'm no longer interested in this "dog-friendly" establishment. If you would like to go to a REAL dog friendly place, try OHSO Brewery.
