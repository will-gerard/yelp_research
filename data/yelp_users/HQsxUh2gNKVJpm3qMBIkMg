AS OF AUGUST 2009, I'M PRETTY SURE THIS PLACE CLOSED DOWN  Ok, this place does look a little ghetto from the outside, if fact they have began to put cardboard signs that read "Open" all over the exterior just so people know they have not closed down!  This is place is worth going into though!  My boyfriend brought me here on our first date (Valentine's Day) and we were blown away by the food.  I ordered pasta with vodka sauce and it was outstanding.  My boyfriend ordered the ravioli and it is his favorite thing to order since.  We also ordered calamari which is pretty good and they made a specialty dessert for Valentines day of heart shaped ice cream with chocolate over it.  They also serve make-your-own Bruschetta, really good that is compliments of the house.  What's so sad is that Macaroni Grill is right across the street and always busy, if people only knew that authentic AMAZING Italian food at La Locanda is a better place to go instead of some chain, I don't think they would need to put those signs up anymore!    The waitstaff is on-point and very professional. The Host is my favorite though, he is so funny and very laid back, it's very easy to feel like a regular there.  The host even makes fun of the decor on the outside!  The inside is pretty cozy, nice atmosphere, they could just do a lot more with the place but maybe that's part of the charm.  They have an extensive bar where you can have a drink before you are seated (rare though, it's usually not that crowded).    I want to tell everyone about this place, I love it!  If you or anyone you know is even thinking about going to that Macaroni Grill across the street, steer them to La Locanda, it will not disappoint!

Out of all the Mexican places I've been to in the Valley, this place has the best enchiladas!  It's not as healthy as some other places but if you are looking for somewhat cheesy and greasy mexican good, this is the place to go.

I definitely need to raise the ratings on Trader Vics!  My boyfriend and I went here for the second time on Christmas Eve for happy hour and again, had an amazing time!    When we came here the first time, our bill was over $200 so we thought we'd save ourselves some money and just check out the happy hour from 4-6pm Monday-Wednesday.  They have about 50 different drink concoctions and most of them were half off (so about $5-6) but not all of them. It's so fun trying different ones, they come in cool tiki-like glasses and are mostly rum concoctions and taste delicious.  We liked the Zombie, Suffering Bastard and Molokai MIke but I must warn you:  THEY ARE POTENT!  This turned into a "cab night" for us but that was after we walked to Coach House afterward...  For appetizers we ordered the Beef Cho-Cho, crab rangoons and the calamari.  The Beef Cho-Cho is sooooooooo good, it must be in some kind of plum sauce and you get to heat it up yourself with a hibachi.  Calamari is one of my favorite foods so I try it everywhere I go and it was very good here, the crispy kind and they didn't put any of the scary tentacled ones in there either that no one eats :-)  Good dipping sauces too...  I must prop out our waitress Brittany, she had great recommendations and was very enthusiastic and on point.  We were again very impressed with the staff there.  I definitely recommend Trader Vics (Home of the Mai Tai) and Hotel Vally Ho as well!

My favorite place in the valley!  Mostly because it is next door to where I live but have ALWAYS had a good time here.  Some people in the Scottsdale/Chandler area do not like it because it is not exactly the "Scottsdale" crowd, much more laid back. You don't have to dress up in heels to go either, flip flops are fine on Friday and Saturday nights.  But if you are in heels, beware of actual sand outside. Bartenders are always friendly, just a good place to chill with friends.  Also, the Baja fish tacos are awesome here!  The nachos are ok too.  They also show UFC fights each month and a fun place to watch football on the weekends.

So I had just gotten back from a weekend in Kansas City where I ate BBQ the entire weekend, I had been craving it since coming back to Scottsdale so we decided to try this place because of all the excellent reviews.  What a mistake!  The ribs were inedible, burnt to a crisp, I don't know how my boyfriend even ate them.  I ate a little of the beef brisket, it wasn't bad, the cole slaw wasn't too bad either but I still can not get over how bad the ribs were.  I will never go there again.

Best chocolate ever!  I tried Leonidas for the first time in Europe and have been looking for it ever since in AZ.  I'm so surprised they opened a store here, would recommend it in a heartbeat.  Also, staff was very friendly, a great place to get gifts!  I just got an assortment of chocolates and was very happy with my choices. The banana creme was surprisingly good and so was the champagne flavored...
