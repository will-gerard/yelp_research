They added broasted chicken to their menu... I love me some broasted chicken, so in I went to investigate.  I do not love me THEIR broasted chicken.  To me it tasted rubbery and had a strange odor, and it was so salty that an hour later I could still taste it. I ordered a few pieces and I ate part of one and then bolted.  I can't speak to anything else on the menu. Their garlic knots, for what it's worth, were fine.

Great homemade dumplings! Otherwise, I'd say good food. The dumplings (and the wonderful staff) are the stars.

Simply the best. These guys are friendly, they know their stuff, and they don't mess around or try to rip you off. Highly recommended.

I love this place! So friendly and they have really cool teas. Today I'm drinking coconut cocoa tea, which isn't actually that sweet but has a wonderful coconut aroma. I like writing here and I will continue to be a loyal customer.

I am in love with this place. I went for brunch on Sunday with three other friends, and we had an amazing meal.  First off, I read about the service here. Some said it was lacking. Perhaps I just got lucky, but the service at our table was stellar. The cute waiter was friendly and attentive and funny. We also got a visit from Chef Elizabeth Meinz, who was awesome. So nice to be greeted and chatted up by the chef!  I had the wildberry pancakes and thought they were perfect. Nice and tart and light. I generally never finish an order of pancakes, because even if it's a short stack, they wind up too heavy for me. Not these. I almost licked the plate. Also the bacon was just right. Thick and tasty and cooked to perfection.  Everyone else at my table had omelets, and everyone raved.  The only slight complaint I had was that they turned on the misters right over our table during the meal. But I'd gladly go home a little misted if I get to eat that caliber of brunch!

I can't actually say much about the service, the chicken, anything like that. All I can say is that I tried to order two pieces of spicy fried chicken--a breast and a thigh--at the drive thru window.   "That will be $9.23," the man said.  "Um."  I sped off.   Now, this was not for two pieces and a drink and a side. Nope. Two pieces, a biscuit, and a dollop of cole slaw.   On what planet are the KFC people living? I can go down the block to LoLo's and get two actual good pieces of chicken and a waffle for $8 bucks.   If they ever decide to lower the prices to fast-food level, I'll try it. Until then, I'll pass!

Really good food. I mean, like, really good. Their broasted chicken is insane. Try the spicy version. So juicy and flavorful, it's perfect. Is the crowd old? Sure. Is it a little "Scottsdale Boys Club"-ish. Yes. None of this matters when you're stuffing your face full of chicken. Very good service, too.

Picture it: Super Bowl Sunday, this year. I've decided not to go to a party because I feel like it will get in the way of me stuffing more and more food in my mouth while watching my Broncos lose. Well, first of all, they won! Second of all, when it comes to a personal Super Bowl Party, let's face it: there are no winners.  Steak. Crab legs. Italian bread. Jalape√±o potato chips. Cheese. Chocolate. Sour Patch Kids.  I woke up the next day and decided it was time to start eating better and to take my fat ass to the gym, but I didn't really believe it would work. I'd been to many gyms, many times, and I'm not great at motivating myself (unless it's about eating candy--then I'm pretty unstoppable).  The point is that I started to change my diet, and by the end of the month I found Mark and Lifestyles Fitness Personal Training. I liked Mark's manner, and I decided to go for it. There are some details that you don't need to know here about a gallbladder attack and surgery and stuff like that. Really all that did was slow me down. It did not stop me. Let me share with you what has changed from my intake in late February, to my test in early June:  Waist: from 40" to 35.5" Weight: from 199.6 to 184.4 Body fat: from 23.6% to 16.0% Lost: 18 lbs of fat Gained: 3 lbs of muscle  My cardio is similarly off-the-charts improved. When I started working with Mark, Drew and Keith, I hated it and my pulse would climb to 160-170 in a hurry and it would take forever to go down. I had to do very little, because I couldn't do much.  Today I did a full workout and while it was challenging, I loved the challenge. I still have a long way to go in terms of cardio health, and I'm not exactly a pinup model yet, but I'm moving in the right direction and I love that.   All three trainers have their own styles, and I like them all very much. They keep things interesting. And they're all really nice guys who will give you the attention you need. And they'll help you with food! Suffice it to say I didn't get here eating Sour Patch Kids.  I strongly recommend these guys. If you're ready for change, they can help!

I was surprised to like this place, given the lackluster reviews on here. Way decent bar food for a reasonable price. Great wings. Nice service. Lotsa eye candy. We had fun!

Insanely good chicken. Salty but not too salty. Crisp but not too crisp. Juicy (there is no such thing as too juicy). The proprietor and staff are always so nice and the food comes quick. Absolutely no complaints, and I have been here A) A few times (what I'd tell my doctor or other half) B) Like every week for the past two years. Old reliable. And good for you, too!

Feeling sad, let down by the world? Despondent over a recent hangnail or paper cut? Angry that your boss ignored your fine work yet again? All of these and countless more would be fine reasons to come to SOL and have a Mango Con Chile Frozen Margarita. Sweet, spicy, goes down real smooth. And then you need to have another. And then another. And then another. Unrelatedly, you should definitely have someone drive you here and away from here.  The food was good, I think. I was drunk, I don't really remember. I think I recall it being good. There was some shrimp appetizer where you have to pull off the shrimp's heads. Hey, they're already dead, I say. They don't feel it. They had some delicious corn appetizer, too, and then these cool taco things you can get a la carte or grouped for you, if I recall correctly. Again, I was drunk.  Nice ambiance, friendly waiter. And yeah, get that drink or three of them.

I really like this place and I think it's here to stay. Had a spicy beer hot dog with bacon, onion and Swiss. Should have added a sauce; oh well, next time. Had a chocolate chip cookie donut, and that was as decadent as it sounds. They lose a star because the service, though friendly, is really slow. We walked in at 12:30 and the dogs didn't come til 1:05. I get that these are upscale dogs and all, but it may be hard to satisfy big crowd with that sort of lag time. Still, great little place. Highly recommended.

I came in for lunch in a bad mood. After Shelby was through with me I was in a much better mood. The shrimp were delicious, she had all sorts of cool suggestions about dipping sauces etc., and all told it was a fun experience. Ask for her. You'll be glad you did!
