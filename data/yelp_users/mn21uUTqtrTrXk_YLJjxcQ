You know that combined feeling of excitement and anticipation you get when you walk into a restaurant and it's as if you've stepped into someone else's country?  Each time I walk into Sinaloa, I feel like I've been transported into a small beach side neighborhood in Mexico.  Although I feel out of place, I'm ecstatic because I'm about to eat some of the best pacifico style seafood in the Valley.  One of my favorite dishes is the Chiccarron de Pargo.  A botana plate of lightly breaded pargo fish (pacific red snapper) that is served on top of a delicious salad that includes poached shrimp, avacados and orange slices.  The "cherry on top" of this dish are the 2 large bacon wrapped peppers stuffed with a cream cheese and shrimp known as "Toritos" which are also available on the menu as an appetizer on it's own.  Oh did I mention there's also a full bar!  If you're not a fan of loud jukebox playing "ba bam bam ba bam bam" ranchero music consider ordering your food to go, which I did just a few hours ago.

I can't believe I'm just now writing my review on Yelp for my favorite sushi joint in town!    My husband has known Mo since way back in the day when Mo was working his magic at Sushi Ko.   We've been going to see Mo at Toyama for about 8 yrs now and we both agree that Mo delivers the freshest sushi in town. Hands down, this is the place to go if you are only about the fish.  It might not be the hip place to go to if you are all dolled up and looking for a scene.  But if you are a serious sushi fan, this is the place for you.

Binkley's is the best restaurant in town, period.   Chef Kevin Binkley, who I understand worked with Thomas Keller at the infamous French Laundry, has a genuine passion for innovative cuisine (foie gras dipping dots anyone?).   My husband and I have been to this restaurant several times within the last year and at each  visit we are completely blown away by the exciting choices on the tasting menu and the wonderful little amuse bouche treats.  The restaurant also has an impressive wine selection and the staff are top notch.    Don't let the unassuming stripmall location fool you....this place will be getting lots of national foodie press very soon!

Wonderful selection of unique pieces to enhance your existing wardrobe or you'll be sure to find a piece for a special occassion.  I've purchased 2 AMAZING dresses that I can't wait to wear when the right ocassion presents itself.  They have 2 "end of season" sales where items can be had for a fraction of the retail price.

Thought I should do a little review on Sala Thai while enjoying my yummy leftovers from last night.  Eating the Lad Na straight from the box, cold!  The value blows my mind.  The freshest and most authentic Thai in my opinion.  And it's BYOB!  This is not a seen and be seen kind of place.  Go to Roka Akor is you are looking for that vibe.  Sala Thai is a little "mom and pop" gem where the focus is on delivering delicious Thai cuisine.   The highlights for me are the shrimp pumpkin curry, egg bomb, and larb.  I get an endorphin rush every time I eat those dishes.  As of late we order take out from Sala every 2 weeks and are consistently blown away by how good the food tastes.  I have only 2 issues.    Their servers need to write down the ordered dishes.  Twice now we've had one particular server who has goofed up our order.  Don't mind waiting a bit for the kitchen to expedite a forgotten dish but when you have your 6 yr old and infant in tow you should NOT have to wait 45 min for your kid's dish to arrive (everything else on the table was too spicy).  They did comp us for the dish but I was glad that wasn't my first time in the restaurant or else we would have been robbed of frequenting the best thai place in the valley.      Second issue.  There needs to be some consistency with the heat scale.  Sometimes a "4" yields a dish that is only slightly spicy and other times a "4" is off the charts too hot.

I love finding amazing food in the pockets of the Valley where you wouldn't expect it to be there.  From the outside, this restaurant is easy to miss.  If you're a foodie looking for a decent place that can accomodate/ tolerate children, this is the place.  Their pasta giovanni is to die for...penne in a mushroom cream sauce with chopped chicken breast and italian sausage.  I've been here 4 times and the food is consistently awesome.  If you are a seafood fan, the cioppino and seafood salad (loaded with shrimp and calmari) are both excellent choices.  The best part of this place is that they can accomodate a customer craving pizza and wings with a beer at the same time they can accomodate a customer wanting oso bucco with a nice glass of wine.   In my personal opinion, Times Square is the most affordably delicious Italian restaurant in the entire Valley.

OMG, thank you Michael Mina for opening the best steakhouse in the Valley.  The Kobe tartare is absolutely incredible.  The tapioca crusted red snapper...beyond words.  And of course their steaks (I've tried the rib eye cap and filet) are absolutely decadent.  (I don't think I'll ever attempt to blow $150 on their A5 Kobe cut).  I'm still trying to comprehend why I wasn't wowed by the lobster pot pie since it's a Mina signature dish.  The presentation was very nice but I wasn't excited about lobster being covered in a heavy sauce.  Top notch service, beautiful interior and their wine list kicks ass!

We were very anxious to try a new Spaghetti Western Production but were suprised to find that the food fell short of our expectations. Pasta dishes definitely need work, al dente means to the bite, not to the crunch!  Bruchetta was tasty but forgettable.  My favorite choice was the Rabbit off the charcuterie menu, although I was looking for a lemon wedge or perhaps a citrus aioli (think crab cake accompaniments).  My husband's favorite dish was the grilled Caesar.  We were at fault for tolerating and not saying anything about the food.  The staff were so friendly and attentive that we didn't have the nerve to explain our experience with Peter Kasperski when he came into the restaurant a few times to check in with his staff.  Will be back in 6 months for another try.  The pretty Uglis, a delicious cocktail made with muddled basil and acqua di cedro uglifruit liquer,  were pretty amazing.   Love the edgy euro inspired interior!

Cafe Bink, the younger sister of Binkleys, is one little gem of a French/Italian inspired bistro.   Expect European sized portions of beautifully crafted dishes such as braised rabbit, crispy duck breast and the unbelivably delicious bolognese.  The staff are always warm and friendly.    We are committed to making weekly visits to Cafe Bink to show our support.

I'm so confused!  I love my fellow Yelpers and so based on reviews I was so expecting more Joy from my Joya experience.  I'm writing this review in my hotel room at the Montelucia....which is the place that I wanted to escape to the minute my massage ended. Over joyed?  Not so much!    OK, my massage therapist was very good so no complaints there.  But this spa place is so cheesy!  And I'm not talking about delicious well-aged Gouda.  I'm talking pure VELVETTA.  I swear the interior decorator went to TJ Maxx and purchased the lanterns, candles, crystals and other decor that is suppose to make guests feel as if they were in the Andulasian region of Spain or in Morocco.  Maybe this place can pull the wool over the eyes of Americans that don't have a passport....just saying.  The hotel is lovely and the staff are very friendly and helpful, but as far as the spa is concerned, I won't be back.    For my $$$, when in town and I feel like treating myself, I will go back to my #1 Willow Stream at the Scottsdale Princess or  #2 Revive at Desert Ridge.    I'm so bummed about this spa experience.  At least I have a nicely appointed bathroom.  (We got upgraded without being charged...likely due to current pool construction).  I'm gonna get myself all dolled up now, snuggle with my wonderful hubby (who couldn't stop giggling when we were giving the "grand tour" of the spa...I swear!  and refused to place his hands on their 50lb crystal...the attendant was not amused!), and have a wonderful dinner at the (for now) hidden gem called Tuck Stop.    Adios mi Amigos!

If you're looking for mediocre pasta dishes and minestrone soup featuring canned vegetables and thawed meatballs then you've found the right place.  On a number of occasions I've had decent Italian food at their older location at Scottsdale/Carefree Highway but at their new establishment the owners have hired cooking staff that serve substandard Italian fare.  Louie and his wife need to be sampling what's cooking in their new kitchen.  For now, stick with their pizzas and salads.

I'm pregnant and at the moment obsessed with pizza pies.  Over the last few weeks I have checked out every hip pizza place in the entire Valley in a quest to find the best pie of the moment.  Last week I heard about The Parlor from Mr. Bob McClendon who told me that aside from Chris Bianco's place, it was his favorite pizza place of the moment.  (McClendon supplies produce to both establishments).  Let me tell you that The Parlor is going to give Pizzeria Bianco some majorly stiff competition.  The Parlor gets my vote for best pizza in the Valley because while their pies are just as fabulous as Biancos, The Parlor has an ultra cool interior, and most importantly, less of a wait time (at least for now).  I checked out The Parlor yesterday for lunch and despite a pretty full house I found the service to be absolutely wonderful...then again maybe they were just fussing over me a bit because I was eating solo and preggers....

Not sure about the other valley locations but tonight's meal at the N. Scottsdale location that replaced Mark Gerding's Thai Pan was a disappointment.   In a nutshell, the owners need to scrap the plan to add a sushi bar (at a Thai restaurant?  Remember, it didn't work for Malees either) and focus on building the flavors and textures in their Thai dishes.  Creating heat in a dish takes more than adding red chili pepper flakes, and yes most can tell the difference in the texture of canned vs. fresh pinneapple. The peanut sauce was very tasty and the red curry was OK after my husband doctored it up with a tray of hot sauces that were brought out when he asked for them but other than that the 3 other dishes we ordered were mediocre at best.  I'm still trying to DIGEST the reviewer who actually wrote that "This place doesn't cater to "dumbed down" American palettes. This is authentic Thai food with that indescribable combination of spices and flavorings."  Dude needs to go to the doctor and get his tongue examined!   For now, when my family's need a Thai fix we'll stick with Swaddee and Sala Thai.

Conveyor belt sushi rocks!  We've been here a handful of times with our young children (just there last night) and by some miracle every time we visit Sushi Station, my husband and I are able to enjoy a decent meal without being interrupted by our kids.  They are too busy watching the revolving small plates of sushi and munching down on the shrimp shumai, edamame and jello.  As for sushi quality, I would give this place a solid B+.  For the price, you won't find better sushi in town.  I can get a 2-piece order of Nigiri Sake (salmon) for $2...and it's sushi grade fish!   We have towering empty plates at our table and the bill for 4 averages $50, sake bombers included!   For serious sushi fans, this place might not rock for you.  My husband and I are serious sushi lovers (we met at a sushi bar back in the mid 90's), so if it's a sushi date night in town we go see Mo at Toyama or head to Roka Akor or Pure.

My husband and I had brunch here last Sunday and it was awesome.  I was so surprised to see someone post a bad review.   The food is excellent...my french toast was the best I've had in a long time.  My husband was in the mood for a burger and it was picture worthy!  We had a wonderful server who offered us a table inside or outside on their patio...we couldnt resist sitting outside to enjoy the 72 degree weather!   And to top it off, they offer $3 mimosas or bloody marys....whoohoo!   By far, one of the best brunch options in the beautiful North Scottsdale area.  We will definitely be back soon because their wine list looks amazing!
