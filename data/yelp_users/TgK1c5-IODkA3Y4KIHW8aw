Wish I could select zero stars!  We were seated at the FURTHEST hightop away from rest of the  patrons. The waitress was friendly, but when a bug was found in a friend's drink, no apology given and no arguement from said waitress when all 5 of us got up and left (despite having a fresh bottle of beer delivered to the table). Ding! Ding! Ding! Probably means that this is not a singular occurrence... Do not go! :(  #gross

I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.  The bruschetta is amazing! The wait staff is uber-knowledgable about the wine and beer and it is a fun, hip, laid-back environment.  Even with 10 people for a bachelorette party, we didn't feel rushed, forgotten or neglected, and the waitresses were super nice! I'll definitely be back to Postino Arcadia!

This place was AMAZING! Amazing food, friendly and fast service, and a really great menu with lots of fantastic Italian favorites. Also, they have Pepsi products!!!! Hooray! I got the Italian sub sandwich and the hubs for a little personal pizza, both of which were cooked perfectly! Gooey cheese, crispy bread, and yummy, warm Italian cured meats!

I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.  Their carne asada burrito is the best I've had in the valley! I love it that you don't have to pay extra for the guacamole on the burrito!! And they have fantastic pico de gallo as well!  Great for a quick lunch or dinner...and I just realized they serve breakfast too! Breakfast served ALL DAY, at that! My friends even had their wedding rehearsal dinner here 2 years ago! Excellent and efficient service, no long line, happy man at the register...makes for a great place to eat!

My first visit to Rock Springs Cafe was pretty good. This is a cute little piece of nostalgia on the highway that would be fun to take out-of-towners to when they come to visit.   Live music in the saloon, cute little gift shop and baked goods for sale...not too bad. I will say that the honey fried chicken was AWESOME but the cherry crumb pie was okay at best.  For a place that touts itself to have the best pies around, one would think that they wouldn't keep them all in the refrigerator to get all cold and stiff. Myself, I like a room temperature pie that doesn't have a crust that shatters when you try to cut into it....but that's just me.  Also, I think that $18 for a take-home pie is crazy!

Blech. The Good Egg my dupa! It's more like "The Bad Egg"! As someone who loves trying new places for breakfast food, the one and only time I have ever eaten here, I got sick. In fact, both the BF and I didn't feel good the rest of the day after eating omelettes from this crap-hole.  Every time I drive by this place (which is every single day because I live in the neighborhood) I say out loud, "Blech. More like the Bad Egg!"   I don't know about other locations in the valley...but stay away from the one on 29th/Bell!

Okay...I'm sorry to those whom I may offend by typing the words that are to follow.  I didn't think that "the best pizza in the country" was that great.  I was super excited to eat here. I've lived in Phoenix for 5 years now and it was the first time that I've really had the opportunity to go. I was warned ahead of time that there is usually a long wait time...but a THREE HOUR WAIT is freakin' ridiculous!  It is nice that the little bar place is next door because it takes your mind off of the wait a little bit...but three hours is just a little much. If I hadn't been there with friends who had driven from Mesa to meet up, there is no way I would have even entertained the thought of sticking around.  By the time we actually sat down to eat, I would have chowed down on a piece of cardboard with pepperoni drawn on it in red Sharpie. Yeah, they use "good" ingredients. Yeah, they have this fancy-schmancy wood fired oven. Yeah, yeah, yeah...it was okay. For the wait we had, I expected a lot more...the pizza was average at best.  On the other hand, the appetizers we got were off the charts amazing. Prosciutto and asparagus, roasted veggies and bread w/ good EVOO...how can you go wrong, right?  Sorry Phoenix, you're pizza gem was a big disappointment. As a pizza lover, I think it was okay...but unfortunately the wait overshadowed the food and I'll never go back.

Slightly chaotic for this first time patron, but the egg sandwich was AWESOME! My friend talked it up last night and it totally delivered! The roasted tomato is definitely the best part ;) #nomnomnom  Despite living a little while away, I'll definitely be back again! #happygirl

This Fry's is pretty cool. It's really big, has lots of interesting fruits and veggies and has a really cool cheese counter area. The hubs and I like to go here once and a while on Sunday afternoons for a change of pace :o)

In the words of the BF, "The breakfast at the Place can't be beat. It's nothing spectacular, its just a good price and a lot of food."   That pretty much sums it up. I am a huge fan of both The Place in Phoenix and in Flagstaff. In fact, we just ate at the home base in Flagstaff this past Sunday for breakfast! My mother from PA and my best friend from San Diego insist on eating here every time they come to visit me in Phoenix. EVERY TIME. Also, being from the East coast...any place with Pepsi and NOT Coke products gets my vote! :o)  I always get the M.Y.O. Omelette and I am never disappointed! The biscuits and white gravy are AWESOME! The only real complaint on the food I can think of is not enough crusty bits in the hashbrowns...and honestly, that's not too big of a deal. I just like really crunchy hashbrowns!  The only bummer about the Place in Phoenix is that if you don't get there before 9am you're due to wait for a L-O-N-G T-I-M-E because its so freakin' good everybody wants in! However, if you don't beat the church crowd, don't fret....it's totally worth the wait!

This little tiny restaurant (which I NEVER knew was there!!) is definitely tied for the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. The penne alla vodka was amazing as well. Two small pizzas and two pasta dishes filled up the 4 of us to the brim!   Great atmosphere, reasonable prices, amazing food and excellent, friendly service...I'll definitely be bringing my family here the next time they visit Phoenix!

The Whiskeyberry drink is my favorite! Muddled blueberries, homemade sweet & sour, and whiskey....AWESOME! The couches make it a lounge-y atmosphere, the bartenders are pleasant and the music and artwork on the walls are definitely conversation starters.   Two thumbs way up!

Real London Bus Company FTW!!   We went for my Bachelorette party and it was AWESOME! For 7 girls out to have fun this was the perfect evening! We started at the Rose & Crown, traveled to The Duce, The Turf, and Copper Blues and ended up back at Heritage Square. Each bar was super fun, the bus drivers were amazing, they had beer ON THE BUS for each person, and the scheduled departure times were perfect at each bar. Just enough time to have fun, not enough time to get into trouble ;)  All in all, super successful and fun bachelorette party!

Veggie quesadilla was amazing! Perfectly spicy...and sour cream came with it! :) Good beer, decently priced.  I'll be back if we're in the neighborhood.

Loved the atmosphere. Loved the booze. Loved the vintage, hip vibe throughout the whole place! Can't wait until the future hubs starts wanting to go to more baseball games this summer! We're definitely going to hit up this place a lot! :o)

Went here tonight with the hubs after repeatedly hearing about it from friends. I got the brisket (no bun), macaroni salad, and coleslaw. All 3 were AMAZING!  I like that they serve their meat "naked" so you can add your own amount and type of sauce. The 4 sauce choices are awesome too! A spicy mustard, Carolina-style sweet sauce, smoky BBQ, and super spicy BBQ sauce...so nice to choose!   In true semi-gluttons style, dessert was devoured by the hubs and me before dinner....brownie with walnuts, marshmallow, chocolate sauce, AND BACON BITS ON TOP!!!!!! LOVE!   Despite not being a super BBQ lover, the casual atmosphere, happy and efficient workers, and amazing food have definitely given this gal incentive to return!

SO MUCH FUN! Went with friends for this event and enjoyed the whole day!   The different types of tequila were interesting (Cocoa Patron, nuff said) but the lines were a little long as the day wore on. Just glad that we went early and got done early because as we were winding down, some people were just starting to get crazy!  I'll totally go back next year if friends want to go!
