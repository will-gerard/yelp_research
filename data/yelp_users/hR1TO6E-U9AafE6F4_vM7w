La Bocca Rocks!! Our favorite place on Mill Avenue! We probably go there at least once a week!   The Bruschetta is off the chizzle!! The bread is perfectly toasted and dressed, and not super filling! Which means you can order some PIZZA!!! The Pizza is always very good, never a disappointment! Our favorite is the Margherita, then it's the mushroom and goat cheese one... it just oozes with flavor!!   The salads are very good as well   The Peroni on draft rocks my world!!! It is soo cold! Plus, it is served in Peroni beer glasses which are kept so cold, that I have a beer Icicle for a minute or two!! Their Mojitos are simply addicting! The restaurant always has great ambience, and is visually stimulating as well.  On Thursdays they have some sort of live entertainment and on Sunday nights they show a movie... kinda weird and frankly boring to me, but hey, do whatchugottado!   I walk to it, but what's even better is you can get there via light rail! Try it out!

My mail was being returned to sender, no forwarding address left...uh....and here I was thinking my renter tried to skip out on a month's rent! Nope! Her rent check was returned to her!  So I call the 480 number...speak with "Erick" I believe.  All i hear from him is "i don't know" to questions such as: Do you know why this happened? How long has it been happening?  Oh, I am lying...he did pass the buck and said to call back later and speak with someone else after they have hopefully talked to the courier.    No wonder all I've been getting is junk mail and one or two bills!!! EEEKKKK!!!! Ahh..nothing like the efficiency of a government ran agency!  Yes, I'm bitter. I don't have a rent check because of them!

Had Christmas Party here...and it was great! We ordered pitchers of Spaten and the waitstaff never let your glass get empty! They have a great selection of wine as well!   The mushroom pizza made my taste buds feel like they were bathing in heaven!! ooof! The pepperoni pizza was also delicious!!! If you're in the mood for pasta and like pesto, try their pesto pasta! great flavor, great texture to the pasta...not mushy at all!   YOU MUST TRY!!!! WE CAN'T WAIT TO GO AGAIN!

Zero stars! where do I begin.. stop by for dinner & drinks. Ask the bartender if he can wipe down the bar it was very dirty,he replied "it shouldn't be dirty I wiped it down last night". made my drink left it sitting at the other end of the bar for ten mins. We Asked for a menu ,gave us dirty one.(see pic.)bartender bitching how he wants to go home...this place is very dirty .dead on a Friday night,now we know why shut  this place down!!,

OVERPRICED! Came here last night,excited to check this place out... Nothing like getting undercooked bacon wrapped around a chili with ZERO crab meat. Menu said"lump of crab meat." The staff looked like they were bored To death oof! Not a pleasant experience.
