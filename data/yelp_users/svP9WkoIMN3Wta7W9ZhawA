The soup is yummers today!  Absolutely fabulous!    I do wish they would offer a soup and sandwich option, though.

Love the stars!  But you can get them online cheaper.  The other lighting that they carry is WAY overpriced and quite antiquated.

I visited here last Sunday afternoon with my ex-husband.  We ordered a Pan Crust  pizza and were told it would take 45 minutes to an hour.  I was pretty hungry so I also ordered the Shrimp Caesar Salad, that I got a glimpse of as a waiter carried one past us, to nibble on during the long wait for pizza.    The salad was ok....mostly lettuce and dressing.  There were about a dozen nicely seasoned shrimp on it but certainly not enough for size or the cost of the salad.    The pizza was ok too, but it was NOT worth waiting 45 minutes for...nor was the whole meal worth $50.00+ for one 12" pizza, one salad and one iced tea!

Turning the closet into a safe place!    I love this small little hardware store and they usually have what I need.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that usually the help is too busy gabbing with someone that they don't realize there are several people standing around waiting to ask them a question.  I've waited patiently several times now, only to give up and go find what I need on my own.

There are ONLY two people who work in this HUGE store today and neither know where lamp oil is or were able to call a manager because the "manager is busy in a meeting."

Love this store!  I can't wait until they get the Swedish Crisp Bread back in stock.    My only gripe would be that when they send out a 50% off one item coupon...they should at least have something in their store that is not on sale so I could use the damn thing!  The coupons are for regular priced items and EVERYTHING was on sale!  Bummer.

I do love cheesecake!  Those two words should not be combined to create a word to describe such deliciousness...but I will not allow such transgressions to distract from my indulgences!  The CF does such an excellent job...I should have ordered two to go.  The red velvet is superb...I'm now wearing it permanently on bum.  Yes...once on my lips and bam...there it is!!

Another Groupon Now Deal...I'm starting to see a trend with these...mediocre food.  I had the red beans and rice which came out warm...not hot.  My husband ordered the spicy fried chicken which was VERY crispy and the brown meat was tender and juice.  The breast, however, was dry and flavorless and needed to be brined before frying just to give it something.  I won't return.  I was barely worth the "deal" but I'm glad I tried it.

I love this airport!  It's so simple to drop-off and pick-up and there's always plenty of cell phone parking!  It's a major hub and I can easily get a non-stop to just about anywhere in the world!  Plus, it's only 15 min from my house!

This place is quite outdated.  It feels like I've traveled back in time 20 years.  It certainly wouldn't be my first choice for a place to stay but if you're going to a big event with 100s of people, they can accommodate the seating.  Plus, parking is fairly easy.

Love, love, love Southwest!  Their new updated app is amazingly simple now too.    I had a flight I booked with points scheduled for today and I had forgotten to cancel it.  A few hours before takeoff, I go on my app, cancel the flight, get 100% of my points credited back to me, and get the $5.00 fee credited back to me!    I simply cannot understand why other airlines do not follow SW's lead.  SW passengers are happier and treated fairly.  And TWO bags at no cost!!!!!    I fly frequently and I always choose a SW flight first!!!

Where's that EASY button?  What they lack in "curb appeal" they make up for in friendly staff.  I was greeted as I walked in the door and helped immediately.  The young man at the front counter even made a special effort to wish me a good day as I left.    Although this store is a bit on the older side, I appreciate the good service more than having to drive out of my way for a newer store.  I'd certainly return.

Menu says Crap Puffs...that should have been my first clue.  Egg flour soup looked like snot.  Lemon chkn = grilled chkn pieces with goo!  There were three of us and two of us were served together.  When we finally decided that they had completely forgotten one meal and got up to leave (as we all shared the two meals and were finished eating) they brought the third meal!

What does 5 stars really mean?  To me, it is based on the individual restaurant providing great food, over-the-top-service, ambiance, cleanliness, fair prices and portions for the TYPE of restaurant that it is.  I feel that some people here are missing the boat with their reviews, as they will RAVE about the restaurant, food and service, but then only give it 3 stars!  How completely unfair!   So, in my reviews, this means that I could give a FANTASTIC McDonald's a 5 star rating if they DESERVED it, but I wouldn't give them 2 stars because of comparing them to a gourmet burger shop!  They are who they are, and if they do it well, they deserve the best praise.  With this thought in mind, ANY restaurant, no matter how simple or elaborate, has the same fair opportunity to earn 5 stars from me, if they deserved it.  If you understand what I'm saying then here goes my review....  Mi Patio is a mid to low price point Mexican restaurant.  Most things on dinner menu were around $7.00 - $8.00.  The atmosphere is simple and not intended for a "night out on the town".    My ex-husband and I went there tonight.  We had two large entrees, two large size margaritas and the bill was $5.00 after our $20.00 Groupon was applied. The service was top-notch, fast and efficient.  Our waiter explained the specials in a way that enticed me to order one.  The bus-boy refilled our salsa and chips at the perfect moment without being asked.  Our food was served hot and in large portions.  In the middle of the meal, our waiter presented us with two shot glasses full of a "surprise" on-the-house-special drink that was very tasty.  When we approached the register to pay after the meal, the gentleman was very friendly about taking our Groupon and he had a genuine spirit of appreciation for us coming into the restaurant, leading me to believe he may have been the owner.    Although this was not a 5-star meal, this place certainly DESERVES 5 stars.

I may update this after tomorrow when I go back there to have them repair the damage they did to my dashboard....but they will certainly need to earn it!  Here's the story...  Yesterday I called to have them repair the navigation system in my Lexus is350.  Don, the owner was courteous and was able to get me in the same day I called.    This place is 30 minutes away from me (and I'm visiting from out of state) so I drove right over and made special arrangements to get a ride since they needed to keep my car for several hours.    When I picked up my car, they charged me $525 for labor...ok....but then $26.25 for MISC....I have no idea what that was for, plus tax too!  I didn't say anything about the extra charge but when I got in my car I was rather annoyed by them not understanding that you return a car the way you found it.  Had to reset the clock, change my radio station from BLARING RAP back to country, turn off the a/c seat they had on high (I don't use it), and hunt for my phone charger they took out.  Any one or two of those things is no big deal but I believe in a service industry you leave other people's property at least how you found it!  But here is the REAL issue....they damaged my dashboard with a huge gash and never said a word!  I'll post a picture.  I called them and then turned right around and returned to the store.  Don was very pleasant and said this happens all the time....SO BE AWARE.  He made arrangements for me to come back on Friday to have it repaired. But he made no other concessions. Now I'm having to take another day out of my five day trip here in Phoenix and pay the gas to drive 30 minutes out of my way and back again in order for them to fix the damage they did to my car!!!!  FAIL!!! :(((((((  ****UPDATE!!!! I was unable to go back to  Scottsdale for the repair, as it did not fit into my tight schedule.  Another Yelper messaged me to tell me to "dispute" the charge on my credit card so I did.  Don contacted me and, as consistent as he had been, he was pleasant and respectful and eager to resolve the issue even though me and my car were now in the Bay Area.  And to his credit, he did everything right...he never got angry, he arranged with Marin Lexus to remove the navigation system again, he arranged for a reputable repairman to travel from Sacramento to Marin to do the repair and he followed-up with me.    I understand that things can go wrong in every business.  I also very much appreciate when a business owner handles those problems fairly and kindly.  Five star update!  WIN :)))))

Wow...this place is AMAZING!  I've been to a few mega churches in Sacramento but this place is really unbelievable in size and amenities of a church.    It's a very casual environment so I almost felt overdressed in my slacks.  We stayed after service and had a nice lunch out on the patio, which was also massive.    The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the initial shock of the service being on screen.  I get it...why make someone repeat themselves 4 times just because I couldn't get out of bed early enough to see it live?  But also because it had a hint of the "get busy for Christ" mentality.  Overall, it was a great experience and if I lived closer I'd probably return.

Four stars only because they need improvement in their bar... like another person posted... the drinks are way over priced for a skinny glass of mostly ice.  (I'd really like to see them improve their lemon drop recipe too, as I won't order one from here again).  The food, however, is fabulous...no matter what you order.

I was impressed but did visit this place mid-day on a Thursday so it wasn't busy.  I was really hoping they would decorate my froth...I know, I know...shallow but these extra little touches lend to the experience.  Hence, only 4 stars.  I'll be back for more.

Hmmm....not too sure about this place.  Ordered the steak salad medium rare and they delivered it very well done.  Can they not SEE the difference?    The waitress replaced our steak salad and we enjoyed the first half of the Super Bowl.  Pretty good venue for that type thing but I wouldn't go here just for the food.  :(

Fabulous food, great prices and they are open LATE!  How did I not know about this place??!!  My fiancé and I stumbled on this cute little place while driving back to Phoenix from Scottsdale.  He ordered a burger and I had a salad.  Large portions, great menu choices and top-notch service.    I just love it when the manager works late, cleans tables and talks to the patrons!!  I've certainly included this place on my "open-late-and-worth-going-to-when-sober" list!

I had no idea there was a regular sit-down restaurant version of this mall-food-court favorite.  The place was absolutely packed and so many were waiting patiently!  I took a seat at the bar and was greater promptly.  I ordered my "mall" fav salad...the Mediterranean.  It was delicious but looked like a smaller portion...could be because of the larger plate.    Can't say it was worth $14.00...$10 something plus tax and gratuity.   I'll definitely come back to try something else though!

For $58.00 including tax...this place is AMAZING! It's the best motel remodel I've ever seen with details and amenities that you'd pay over $100 more per night for.  Yes, I'm here on the off-season but I just need a bed and a pillow and some quite and I don't want to feel like I'm stay at Motel 6!    A few months ago my husband and I were here staying at my daughter's house a few blocks away and we had dinner at the restaurant...I think it's called The Sevens????  It's attached (or next) to this hotel and the food was really good.  I would definitely return!!!

This Fry's is almost as nice as AJ's with their fabulous selections...ok...that might be a stretch, but compared to the Fry's on 7th Avenue, it's quite luxurious!  The produce is always fresh AND guaranteed fresh, which is better than AJ's and a LOT cheaper too.  I'm at Camelback and Central so I go a bit out of my way to shop here but it's much better than anything closer to me...just don't accidentally go on a Wednesday morning!!!  That's blue-hair day.

I like the store because of their prices but I have a hard time with the clientele at this particular location.  It's not that I'm a snob... It's just a rough crowd.    One thing that the store could greatly improve on is having friendlier staff and always having an attendant at the self checkout line. That seems to always be a shortfall for them.

Soooo slow!  Such terrible counter service...every time.  I have banked with VWCU for 13 years...I started back when they were DM Credit Union in Tucson.  Like with any bank, when you first open your account, you are treated like a criminal until you can prove yourself worthy.  Since I've never bounced a check and I have several loans with them...including my mortgage, it was easy for me to develop a good relationship many years ago when I lived and banked in Tucson.    Then I got divorced and moved to Phoenix 1.5 years ago.  I was glad there was a Phoenix branch near me, however, I had to open a new account (the ex got the old one) and start all over again.  But that's now where the issue is...  My beef with VWCU here in Phoenix is their attitude and that they don't know me...but it's not because I'm not there in person as I go into the branch several times each month...making sure to go into the branch, not the drive through, in order to get to be personable and friendly.   But the staff here is LETHARGIC!!  They never smile, they work at a snail's pace, they don't use more than 2 words to greet you, and they make every transaction worse than pulling out my toenails!  It's almost comical, the "rules" they follow in order to inconvenience their customers.  I'm all about safety, and ensuring my accounts are kept from fraud, but I have yet to experience a smooth transaction even ONCE at this branch.  Can't the Tucson staff influence the people up here to have better customer service skills?  If it weren't so inconvenient to change banks, I would have RUN to another bank a year and a half ago.  :(  I'm always VERY DISAPPOINTED every time I go there, hence, why I'm finally complaining about it on Yelp.  At least they have online banking...which is the only reason they even get two stars!

Always the worst customer service.  I've been waiting 10 minutes for a notary while only 1 of 4 people working in the branch is busy helping customers.  They are too busy looking at their computer screens to pay attention to the people standing in here waiting!  I can't wait to change banks!!!  I HATE this branch!!!!!

We met some long lost friends here last night.  Fast and efficient service.  The only issue was that music was to start at 9:00pm...we left at 10:30 and the music still had not begun.  At least we were able to chat with our friends but we were a bit disappointed as the sound check sounded great.  The fish sliders were super!  Potatoes skins needed salt.  I'd certainly go back.

I'm never really thrilled when someone suggests Maize's...even though it's attached to my building.  Not even on burger night when they advertise $5.00 burgers...which, btw, is really a $10 burger because you HAVE to order a drink to get the special.  Ok.  But $2.50 for iced tea, another $1.00 for cheese, and REALLY, you're going to charge me another $1.00 for a salad INSTEAD of fries??  The burgers just aren't that interesting or flavorful!  I'd much rather go down the road on Central to a different burger night special and get something delicious.

People love Maizie's!  I've tried to join their club but I don't see what the fuss is all about.   They get a star because they are attached to my building and they have great happy hour prices.  So, if I drink to much, I can crawl home.  They also get a full star for good service and being so sweet to my doggy...who is welcome outside.  Then another star for decent food.  But, just skip the $5 burger on Mondays...It's not that great!  I'll even give a 1/2 star for all the people that rave about how good this place is...round up and it's 4 stars.

I won't buy my dog food anywhere else!  They are a small, family-run store with EVERYTHING you need for your pets!    Super friendly, reasonable prices...and they'll share a coupon willingly!  I recently saw a sign for doggie teeth cleaning where they don't sedate your pet.  I'm looking forward to trying this service.

Update:  I'm upping this to 5 stars because I find myself saying out loud, "I LOVE Fresh and Easy!"  Even though they don't carry fresh beets anymore :(  I REALLY like this grocery store.  I can't stand to shop in a mega store and go back and forth between 27 isles just to get everything on my list.  I usually feel like I need to go home and change into tennis shoes just to do my grocery shopping...but NOT now that I've discovered this quaint little store that has almost everything...including fresh beets!   The produce is far fresher than what I've found at the regular Fry's, Bashas', Safeways...but I'm disappointed they don't carry jicama or living butter lettuce, otherwise, I'd never have to step foot in another grocery store again.  LOVE  the store, the staff and the concept...BRILLIANT!

There are no words for how horrible this place is on a Saturday afternoon...I honesty think a funeral would be better.  Every person in here smells bad, looks bad, and behaves badly!  I did not see one person with even a pleasant look on their face.  :(  Perhaps they have cheap prices on crap but I will GLADLY pay twice as much for ANYTHING to never step foot in this place again!     Zero stars!

Unbelievable FAST, FRIENDLY and efficient service!  I'm blown away by how nice everyone was....big smiles, kind conversation, joking attitudes and everyone seemed genuinely happy to work there!    Each customer service rep has a card on their desk with their full name so that you can go to AZDOT.GOV to leave a review of their service.  It's a Thursday morning....I was there to change my last name and I was in and out in under 20 minutes!!!

I've been here several times and it gets less and less fun every time.  Primarily due to the deteriorating clientele and over priced drinks.  $27 for 2 margarita plus the cover charge?  Mmmm...the drinks aren't THAT good!  Plus, it's actually a swingers' bar and because of that there's always about 4 sleazy men for every woman.    The outdoor patio is full of smoke so forget about enjoying any fresh air.  The music is pretty decent...soooo 2 stars.

Taco Tuesday!!  The shrimp tacos are so, so delish!    I took a friend to The Vig this past Tuesday evening and as soon as we sat down, I remembered Gallo Blanco!  I begged him to leave so we could go have shrimp tacos but we didn't have time.  NEXT TUESDAY FOR SURE!!!

Okay, you could not ask for a better staff at this location. They are friendly, helpful, smiling and just all-around happy people!  They were so excited when they heard it was my first time to. Dutch-Bro that they stamped my stamp card a few extra times and eagerly asked me to come back soon!    The coffee was great but I'll return for the staff!

I could eat here every day!  So what's not to love?  I've tried the competitor and it was just missing something...probably that unique Chipotle flavor.    I've been doing my taxes lately and so I've been reviewing all of my receipts for quick meals.  When I see that I've spent more money on a fast-food meal than I did on a very satisfying Chipotle meal, I want to kick myself for ever having strayed!    Consistent, delicious, filling, healthy (if done right) and CHEAP!  What's not to love...right?

I'm updating my review as I feel I was being a bit (or a lot) pissy the day with my 3-star rating.  I've always really like this place.  It takes an entire team of excellence to get a 5-star rating and I shouldn't have let just one bad moment define my overall experience with Hula's over the past 3 years!  It really is one of my favorite places!

First visit here and I'm pleasantly surprised!  Great breve cappuccino and I just love when they decorate the froth!  I can't give it 5 stars because it just wasn't THAT impressive but I'll certainly return.

Bought a jar of blueberry moonshine!  Wow!  Apparently you're not suppose to pour it into a martini class and drink 2-3....it's 100 proof!!!

This place gets 5 stars because it's the BEST full-set and pedi for the price.  I know you can get a classier atmosphere in a chic-ier spa, but you're going to PAY for that one hour and when you leave, you're nails and toes aren't going to look any better than if you'd gone to TDN!  I just took my daughter there on Tuesday for a full set and a pedi and it cost me $36.00 (not including the tip)!  I was paying $80.00 for the same thing down in Tucson.  I only wish you could set appts but I won't ding them a star for this due to the affordable prices!

Trying the Turkey Sand rage!    Seven stars for the Turkey Sandwich.  One star for the staff.  I hate writing bad reviews but where on earth are restaurants hiring their staff from lately?  Our waitress was the WORST...inattentive, sloppy in appearance, slow to respond and truly uninterested in her job.

Convenient location on my 15 block commute home from work...but I wouldn't give stars for convenience...the food HAS to be worthwhile.  This was pretty tasty.

Sicily looks FANTASTIC!!!  And Brandon left her long beautiful eyelashes without me having to ask!  Her paw pads were perfect and she did not seem traumatized by this visit like she had from Petsmart.  I will certainly return!

ANOTHER 5-Star shout-out to Brandon for making my Shee-Poo, Sicily, look SO incredibly adorable that everyone wants to know: WHO is her hairstylist!!!?  I won't go anywhere else!  Consistently PERFECT!!!

I moved out of state last April and I couldn't find a groomer in Marin Co. with a decent review...so what do I do?  I take Sicily to PHOENIX so that Brandon can work his magic!  I might have to move back to Phoenix just for this reason alone.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!

Although it was a bit difficult to find, once we found it, we were pleasantly pleased.  The meal was worth the menu prices and the service was decent.  Be sure to ask them to validate your parking.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the broom and mop being stored in plain sight along with a high chair....sort of gave the place an iHop feel when it really isn't necessary.

We don't seem to exist here.  The service was horrible.  Sat at the bar right in front of the bartender who was too busy cleaning glasses to acknowledge us.  I'm usually rather patient about these types of things, as I know they have other tasks to accomplish, however, it was NOT busy at all and it wasn't like she didn't see us.  She just gave us the impression that she would get around to taking our order when she felt like it...which was certainly not any time soon.  It was awkwardly rude and strange behavior.  If I weren't new to the area (and my guest from out of town) I would have thought she was an old enemy from days gone by.

I'd come back!  Great prices, good food.  Service was fantastic!  Kim (one of the founders) was very friendly.  Fun atmosphere...filling lunch for two WITH drinks only 13 bucks!  Nice!

The Honeydew Soba, Basil Seed Drink, BBQ Beef and Fresh Spring Rolls were super delicious!  I was very impressed with all if the food.  The clientele here were also very friendly the night we dined, as people shared their favorite dishes and talked to each other.  Extra friendly waiter as well!!!  I can't wait to return!!!!

I like the team service concept here.  The bartender picked up my plate when I finished since he just happened to walk by.  I LOVE that!    I had the brown bag chicken sandwich...SO DELICIOUS...how can you go wrong with avocado, goat cheese and huge chunks of chicken on your bun?  Be sure to add Cholula to the Mac and Cheese...YUM!!!!

I LOVE this car wash.  I don't particularly care for the customers here and that somehow this carwash is the new children's museum but as far as the establishment...they have thought of everything.  A wet towel, good machines, free air and vacuum.  I've never had trouble finding a spot under the canopy either.  Who can complain about a $3.00 car wash?

I received A+ service from Doug when returning my equipment.  Great experience...I would much prefer to go into this store than to talk to anyone on the phone from Cox.

I'm not clear why this place boasts "you can experience the best food the whole world has to offer".  The free chocolate covered strawberry was a nice touch but didn't make this the best restaurant.  It wasn't BAD...it just wasn't that good.

Awe...simple, cheap and delicious....the only fast food I'll do!  The manager here takes on an active roll and seems genuinely concerned about making sure the customers are happy.    I also like the outdoor seating area with the shade tarps...there's plenty of seating and the place is very clean!

First...I have not completed this procedure yet with Dr. Ali Mosharrafa...that's tomorrow.  However, I still feel qualified to give a 5 star rating, even now, but I WILL certainly update my review post-op too.  The reason for this, is that I've been interviewing Plastic Surgeons since November.  A total of 11 of them in Phoenix, Scottsdale and San Francisco.  Some of the other Drs. included:  Dr. Chernoff, Dr. Meger, Dr. Nachbar, and Dr. Simmonds....these listed had the best ratings, reviews, certifications, etc.    I have actually met with Dr. Ali Mosharrafa three times (2 consulations and 1 pre-op).  From the moment he comes out to the waiting room to greet you personally, to the moment you walk out the door, you feel completely confident not only in his care and expertise, but in the professionalism of his entire staff.  How many Drs take the time to really explain the good, the bad and the ugly?  He did not tout unrealistic expectations, nor did he (or his staff) try to "sell" me on doing this right away.  In fact, his overall concern for my well-being was his FIRST priority...at the risk of not going forward with the procedure now.   Dr. Mosharrafa welcomes as many questions as you can throw at him.  He takes as much time as you need.  I'm confident in my choice of doctors and I hope that if anyone reading this, who is planning a rhinoplasty procedure, will check back for my post-op review and also not waste as much time as I did with consultations.  :)  I'm looking forward to a new nose!

I did the procedure on Thursday and I'm VERY pleased with the results.  Bandages came off on Monday and there was minimal pain.  I was so happy that Dr. Mosharrafa does not "pack the nose" as I've heard that is the most difficult part of the procedure to deal with.  Having my nose drain onto a gauze is not only more comfortable but it just seems like a much more natural way for my nose to begin the healing process.    I experienced a post-op trauma on Sunday night.  (I got hit right in the face while still wearing the bandages).   I ended up calling Dr. Ali at midnight through tears and he was very considerate and reassuring.  When I saw him the next morning he again reassured me that it was best for me to have called and that he was there for ANY questions or concerns.    For bed-side manners...he gets and A+.  For skill and expertise A+.  For being a person that you just feel confident and trust in...A+.  I'm very happy with my new nose and my choice of Drs.  I would certainly recommend him to anyone!!

My balcony overlooks this quaint little place.  I was horrified when I first noticed it was a yogurt shop...as I am truly, madly, deeply in love with plain tart frozen yogurt and if they carried it, I surely would spend every afternoon and spare penny keeping them in business.  I could feel my butt getting bigger every time I looked at the cute little teal building so it was months before I dared to ventured in.    Now I have a deal with myself.  I will ONLY go there AFTER I work out!  Not only to keep my buns small enough for my jeans, but also so that adorable young man that works there doesn't feel stalked!  ;-)

The roast beef special today with caramelized onions and blue cheese was REALLY tasty!  Have you ever walked into a restaurant or retail establishment and just felt good about it?  I so want this place to succeed.  Something about the greeting, the friendly staff, the owner  personally making my sandwich, and then coming over to ask me how it was...you can't ask for more "heart" put into a start-up sandwich shop!!  Even a PB&J tastes better when someone else makes it...but these sandwiches are terrific.  I will certainly return!   Thank you, Zookz.

I really enjoy eating lunch here....so much, I've come here 2 days in a row and I don't ever do that!    The portions are perfect...you'll be pleasantly full.  But more than that....your taste buds will thank you!  Everything I've had here was uniquely different and delicious!!!

I purchased a Groupon and was very pleased with this experience!  The manager gives a VERY aggressive scalp massage and Delia styled my hair beautifully.  The BEST part...my hair was light, bouncy, silky and stayed pretty for 3 days!!!!

This place uses the same distributor as where I used to get Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar in Sacramento!  Superb!!!!  Best I've ever had!   Unfortunately last week I went by to get more of that beautiful balsamic and they are no longer in business.  Total disappointment, as I loved this and have told so many people about it.  Perhaps it was a cost thing...it was a bit pricey.

Brevé Cappachino!    I've never been a big fan of taste of Starbucks coffee but, certainly, it's always a welcoming environment.  However, today...my coffee was brilliantly made...even in the paper cup!  Hoo-rah, for the new Starbucks on 7th St and Osborn!

This is really a 4.5 star place....particularly for the ambiance and Clever design.  The food is pretty tasty but not over-the-top fab.    Daisy is a great waitress with a friendly smile and she's attentive without being irritating.    I've heard that old business next door will tow your car so be careful to park appropriately!

If I were not sitting here with an empty water glass and still feeling a bit hungry after having finished my delicious Wild Mushroom Tortelli lunch, this would have been a five star review.   As I was writing this, I had originally put 3 stars, but then a manager just came to apologize for the small portion and to offer a complimentary glass of wine or desert for my disappointment in the portion size.  (I'm only 130 lbs so it doesn't take a tremendous amount to fill me up).  I declined the atonement.  Perhaps I'll give them another try sometime...as the flavors were fabulous!

I started going here about a month ago.  It's very friendly and anyone at any level will get a great workout, have fun, learn some skills, and meet new friends!  Be careful, though, it's addictive!
