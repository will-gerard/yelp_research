My fianc√© and I have been searching for a new favorite sushi bar in North Scottsdale...well, we found it. Toyama is superb!  The owner/chef, Mo, is amazing! Very conversational and personable, oh...and he makes some absolutely delicious sushi! He asked us what we liked, and gave some samples of things along the way. We ordered one last roll, and he made one special for us based on what he thought we liked. It was fantastic!!  We will be back!!

Belsito saved my day!!! I am having a dinner party in a matter of hours, and the garbage disposal broke, causing a flood under my sink. From the time I called to the time it was fixed, under 1.5 hours! Jim was beyond professional, and honest in his repair. Very fair pricing, and the voucher from Yelp ($50 for $100) was just an added bonus. Belsito has my business for life!!

I'm a newbie to Jo Paris Salon, and I cannot say enough good about the service and friendliness of the staff.  My stylist, Rebecca Steele, was absolutely FABULOUS. Rebecca colored my hair perfectly and matched my new extensions.  She's an extension EXPERT!  I've had them for quite some time, and she is, by FAR the best.  Super thorough, and she knew exactly how to place them for the best coverage and they're totally undetectable. I always felt some discomfort for the first few days, but the way she was able to place them, I can't even feel them.  And...She's got such an amazing personality to boot!    SO happy to have found Rebecca and Jo Paris!

I don't usually write a review of a restaurant, unless it's stellar or completely awful. Unfortunately, when it comes to Sakura, it's the latter.  My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a go, for a nice Friday night dinner. We are sushi lovers, so we were excited for a good meal. Our order was wrong, twice, and on the third attempt we told the server to just forget our last order.   The sushi was subpar, and we were jokingly saying to one another, "well, I sure hope we don't get sick!" The miso soup was absolutely terrible. Carrots, celery & onion...in miso? Never in my 25+ years of sushi eating have I seen this...for good reason.   Note to self: when a sushi restaurant can't get something so simple as miso right, you should probably skip the rest of the meal.  Needless to say, we will never go back.

I can't say enough good about Javelina Wine Tours!  Had such an amazing time, enjoying 4 wineries with my group of girlfriends.  Trevor couldn't have been a better tour guide.  The luxury SUV was outfitted with healthy snacks, water, and was also super clean.  Trevor made sure our menu selections for lunch met any dietary restrictions, and he gave us as much time at each winery as we needed.  We will DEFINITELY use Javelina again!

Absolutely fantastic meal!   It's been awhile since I thought to myself, "wow, this is really fantastic". It's been even longer since I was super happy with the money spent for a meal out!  Twisted Grove, you've impressed. Joseph, our server, was fabulous. His recommendations were spot on, we all ordered from his list. And, his service was paramount.   The gnocchi with short ribs, crab cake, twisted noodle salad & tres leches cake are all highly recommended!  We will be back!
