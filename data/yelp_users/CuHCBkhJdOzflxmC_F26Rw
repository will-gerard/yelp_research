If I had I choice I would personally have given them a 0 star rating.  It was that horrible of an experience. I have been to many upscale restaurant and watching all of Gordon Ramsay's show. I am usually glued to his tv shows watching how great of a chef he is and the service he expects his teams to provide.   We traveled all the way from Arizona to celebrate my boyfriend and his buddies birthday at Gordon Ramsay steakhouse. This was the only reason we traveled all the way to las vegas. We had high expectations and heard so many great things about the restaurant.    First off, it started by the multiple attempts to try to make reservstions. I had to call atleast 5 times with multiple run arounds. The first time, the reservation line told me I had to talk to special reservation since I had a party of 8. They provided me with a number. This number they provided me could not take reservations for less than 10. So then I call the reservation line again. The reservstion line tells me they cannot take reservations for more than 6. They told me I had to talk to the restaurant. So I ask them for a number. The reservation line tells me they don't have a number.  They tell me they can transfer me. So they do and I end up back at the same reservation line again. After about 3 attempts of transferring they provided me a number for a manager. I was irritated already at this point. However, I continued to try over and over because this was for my boyfriend and our friends birthday. Finally, I got in touch with a manager.  When I spoke to the manager and made the reservation I confirmed with the manager atleast 3 times if this was Gordon Ramsay Steak inside of Paris hotel. The mamager reassured that I was talking to the manager at Gordon Ramsay Steak. She even guaranteed me the reservation was there and not to worry that she had it taken care. I took her word for it and thought after this horrible reservation experience everything was going to be great.   Forward time a month later..we show up at the restaurant to find out the reservation as the staff claimed was made at the wrong restaurant. The restaurant also never even called to confirm our reservation for saturday night. Most restaurants call the day before to confirm. Had they called I would have known there was a "mix up" and made arrangements or gone to the correct restaurant...as they claimed I was absolutely wrong.  I had no Gordon Ramsay even had a pub and grill. We get to the restaurant and we are told the reservations were made at the pub and grill. I asked how is this possible I told the manager I was reassured and guaranteed that I was talking to the manager at the steak restaurant.  The GM happened to be standing there..I believe his name was JP. He was beyond rude. He did not once apologize for the mix up. Blamed it completely on me and stated that his staff would never do such a thing and I was absolutely wrong and had no idea what I was talking about. He kept trying to give me a confirmation number.  Great that you have a confirmation number but what is this going to do? The fact was..the "GM" who I could almost bet should have been hired for great service provided the worst service I have ever seen in a high end restaurant.  The GM could have handled this is very many different ways. Had he offered to even call the other restaurant to let them know we were on the way or even apologized for a mix up that would have been fine and I would have appreciated the help. The fact that he just continued to blame me and give me a snooty stuck up attitude that was terrible and made us feel as though we were not good enough for his restaurant. Words can't even explain how he talked to us and how unbelieve the "GM" was. I have never been so upset before. I have managed restaurants before..I also come from 12 years of customer service jobs. I can reassure you my friends and family will never be back to any Gordon Ramsay chain of restaurant.  We were extremely disappointed and let down by this experience.  Especially after traveling all the way from arizona to celebrate and eat at Gordon's restaurant.

I love the food at this restaurant. I usually go to the one on Lindsay rd.  However,  today I had the worse experience ever with them. I called in an order before 11 am, they told me it would be ready in 15 mins. I got there and waited until 11:25 and still had no breakfast burrito. I asked them about it, they said it was on the way out in a minute. I waited another 5 mins. Needless to say, I left at 11:30 with no food and a refund, since they haven't even started cooking it yet. Not sure I will come back to this location again. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the woman up front who I believe is the manager,  was very nice apologized and refunded me my money and provided me a $5 gift card for my time.

We didn't even use the cleaning service due to the price we were quoted, when I called to try to get a price quote, I was told the closet was considered another room. The guy told me it was going to be around $250 for 3 rooms and 2 small closest that were not even walk in closest. I told him what we were quoted $148 with ZEROEZ and he told me that was 100% my best choice. These big companies do not consider a closet an extra room, they consider that part of the room. Called and confirmed with multiple big companies that they do not charge extra for the closets. I only gave the company one star because I had to give a star. If I could, I would give them zero stars.

Great customer service! New place in town..pulled up they were closed but the owners/employees came out and opened the door and invited us in. We weren't aware for the soft opening they closed at 6. We got there at 7, an hour after close, and they still welcomed us to come in and try them out. Not only did they open up for us an hour after their closing but they offered us complementary taro boba, which was delicious! Boba was perfect!  Their snow is very fluffy and just the right amount of topping and sauce! Definitely cannot wait for their grand opening.
