Ruffino Italian Cuisine has become a favorite for dinner since 2003. The food is consistently delicious and they offer NON-WHEAT pasta. Although, I am disappointed they have caved to the ranch raised fish--Cod and Salmon propaganda.  The wait staff is well-trained, efficient, courteous and accommodating beyond the call of duty.

Tme to boycott Starbucks Again!  First I boycotted because Starbucks didn't offer non-dairy or non-soy milk for the Green-tea latte`  Recently, I discoverd Starbucks began offering coconut milk. Happily drinking Green-tea latte` until I discovered they charge 60 cents extra for the coconut milk.  Not only am I paying for the milk for a latte` I pay extra to have coconut milk. Outrageous given the fact that the average cost of a 1/2 gallon of whole milk is $2.01, and a half-gallon of 2%milk is $1.92.  I do not know how much milk is used to make the green-tea latte`, however, let's say it is 1/4 cup for a '(medium) and 60 cents extra for coconut milk. Effectively, I am paying the equivalent for nearly a quart of milk and this is in addition to the price to use cow's milk.  If this isn't outragous I don't know what is. Boycotting Starbucks Again!!

Fresh delicious food and generous portions. Love Pita Jungle.  The roasted chicken salad is the best.  My 2nd favorite is humus with roasted chicken in a wrap. Because I do not eat  Wheat  they graciously substitute Brown rice.  As soon as they serve Wheat Free wraps I will come more often.    1949 W. Ray Rd. was the closest location.  Recently a location opened at 4921 E. Ray Rd. only 6 minutes from my house.  OH Happy Pita Jungle day.    Servers are pleasant, accomodating and efficient.  Never have to wait long for a table or service.

Good EGG - You are NO longer a 'Good EGG.'  You fell off the wall. Why??? Because you deceive your customers.  I am sure other restaurants do too and when I recognize the deception I am no longer a customer.  Good EGG has been (NOTICE: I said has been) one of my favorite places to have breakfast with family or friends. NO MORE!!!  WHY Because you are serving Corn Syrup with a hint of ([probably fake) Clover instead of the HONEY I asked for.  OF Course, I understand over 50% of the Honey Bees have been killed by Monsanto Pesticides and Herbicides. Therefore, there is a Honey Shortage.  BUT that doesn't give you the 'right' to deceive your customers.  If the waitress said, My apology, we don't serve Honey because it is too expensive.  Or we serve Honey with an uncharge of 20 cents, I could live with that. Blatantly serving me FAKE Honey is NOT OK.  Got it???  I won't be back until I am notified YOU have ceased to serve FAKE Honey.

Cameron, The Good Egg Customer Service:  Thanks for your response.  I am not convinced. The 'so-called' Honey was thinner than traditional Honey and had only a hint of Clover. This is definitely not the traditional Clover Honey that I have eaten in 47 of 50 states in the past 60+ years. Have you checked with your supplier? They might be selling FAKE Honey made with Corn Syrup and fake Clover flavor.

Oregano's service and food is top notch. The only negative is no (Wheat and Gluten free) menu. The Oregano favorite salad is my favorite since I am Wheat free. And to make it even more special one can choose lettuce or spinach or half lettuce and half spinach. A half order is adequate for lunch or dinner. A full order is more than most people eat. And if you aren't WHEAT free; (notice I cheated once of a few bites) the killer skillet baked hot from the oven Chocolate chip or Macademia nut cookie with icecream are a must. Or you can have half Chocolate chip and half Macademia nut. They aim to please.   I have eaten at all the Valley of the Sun locations and Flagstaff. They are all equally excellent in service and food. I was delighted when Oregano's opened a location at Elliot and I10 near where I live. I bring all my out of town guests to Oregano's.

I went back to the scene of the crime last night, Oregano's @ 1130 S. Dobson Rd., Mesa, AZ the location of my introduction 2005. To my delight, Oregano's has a Gluten Friendly menu. I have been asking for years and my wish came true with one caution. Because the kitchen equipment and working space are shared with Wheat products, Gluten Friendly means that there could be some contamination with Wheat. While some people might not be able to tolerate any Wheat, a little contamination won't affect me. Now if I can convince them to offer Wheat free sinful cookie cooked in a dish with ice cream on top, I'll be happier.
