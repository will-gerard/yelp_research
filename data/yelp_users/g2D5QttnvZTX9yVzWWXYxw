I don't know how we even came across this complex.  Luck I guess.    Did anybody say it yet? well I'm not gonna look through all of the reviews and I'm too lazy to CTRL+F.  But the water boiled beef is the SHIT! I couldn't decide between the chicken or beef, so the waitress let me do a combo. SWEEET.  Chinese broccoli, dan dan noodles, too many goodies to name!  Loav dees pless

my my my...  spectakski.  Not going to read through all of these reviews, and not wanting to be too redundant, I'll just say the fig/ prozuut  and tomato jam/ sheep's cheese were insane! I may just order a board of the two on my next visit.  Wasn't too jazzed about the salmon or buratta/bacon (they were good, but paled in comparison.  They sell the bread too!  I was doubting myself the whole way home as to why I would buy a $7 loaf o' bread, then I ate it again and realized I have short term memory loss ;)  CHEERS

I don't know how a place like this, that serves the quality of food that it does, and has the seating capacity of 5 is never crowded when I go in.  The tacos here are phenomski! There is no other way to put it, carne asada, cabesa (head), lengua (tounge)-my mouth is watering right now...  This place will give you the shitty-rickity cart flavor of a taco shack taco without the worry

As I think of my $80 tab and try and remember anything memorable about the meal, I stare off into the distance and forget to breathe through my nose.....  Beef bulgogi was run of the mill and the wee sized pot of steamed rice was, well, wee.  Nakji Dol Pan (Octopus stir fried with chili paste) was spiced properly and pretty tasty, but had no contrast and was getting monotonous  Tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlet) was pedestrian  kimchi and accoutrement were also pretty bland.  eh eh eh

This is one of the better places to dine in Casa Grande. The temperature of the restaurant and the speed of the service knock a star right off. It is freezing in the restaurant, and this coming from a guy that runs hot. The restaurant wasn't too crowded, so I'm not sure what was taking so long.   Anyway, I ordered the Philly Cheese steak, with sweet potato fries. The Sandwich was a very good representation of a restaurant style cheese steak (not to be confused with traditional). The roll was soft and buttery, meat was very tasty and the veggies and cheese were not rationed.   The sweet potato fries could have been cooked a little longer, as they were all floppy :( So if this is common practice be sure to ask for them well done.   Will return! Maybe for the Reuben next time!

Really good breakfast spot!  At times the two-waitress-wait-staff can get overwhelmed and your water glass may go empty for a while.  But the food is good.  My usual order goes as follows: M/R steak and eggs, hashbrowns well done, 1/2 order biscuits and gravy, pancakes, 2 slices of wheat toast and some coffee.  Gets me over my hangover every time! Everything is always cooked the way it was ordered and fresh.  They also make fresh pastries on sight, but never had the room for 'em at the end of the meal. One of these days Alice...

-Soooooper oily, straight inedible softshell crab -cold, dry roast pork -cold, soggy skin roast chicken -oily pan fried noodles -cold chinese broccoli  Saving graces were the rice noodle, which is hard to fuck up, the kongee, and the coconut bread  won't be back

If you go during the weekend, expect an hour wait.  You've got nothing to do so just sit in some of the lounge chairs out front and relax.  I had the turkey omelete with borsand cheese (on of my new favorite things), wife had the bagels with lox (capers, tomato, yadda yadda yadda) and my daughter had the chocolate chip pancakes.  We were all very satisfied with our meal, and from what I remember not that expensive. So whenever we're in the Scottsdale area and have some time to kill, we'll stop in for a great breakfast

Had the Delux with it's arugula and onion/bacon mush (for the record, if you're going to but bacon on a burger, it NEEDS to be in CRISPY, BACON-STRIP FORM), and I have to say I was immensely unimpressed...flavor was lacking :/ The french fries were ok, sweet potato fries fared a little better.  Häagen-Dazs choco shake was rich and super chocolatey (make sure you have some water on standby!)    That pretty much does it...probably won't go again.  Wasn't terrible, but was far from great.  I'll still get my late night/early morning burgers from Whataburger, yup I said it, Whataburger.

There is a bread machine in house! When I say bread machine, I mean industrial strumpf! It smelled of steamed pork buns when we entered, so my plan of just getting just a bahn mi was out the door!  First off the steamed pork bun was ridankulous.    I ordered the combo #11 and a thai iced tea.  The sandwich was not as full as the picture would lead you to believe, but the sub was still tasty; crisp veggies, tasty meats and crunchy, fresh-baked bread. Thai tea was perfect.  Over all awesome sammiches but........  CASH ONLY! so leave that plastic at home.

very good woodfired pizza! My wife, daughter, and I had the vegetariana (tomato sauce, mozz, mush. artichokes, roasted red peppers, and zuchini)  the quattro formaggi (fontina, parmigiano, and mozz) sans the gorgonzola and basil (too strong for the lil one's palate) and the Rustico (mozz, prozjoot, and arugula) respectively. light and chewy crust, fresh, high quality ingredients, overall spectacular pizza.  We are not from Phoenix, but visit often. We have heard of the mythical, never ending line that Bianco possesses, but I couldn't imagine the pizza being any better than this, maybe it's the selection they have, I don't know. My daughter savored the marscapone and nutella filled crepe that she got for making a happy plate! But it was much to small to satiate all  three of us without wanting to order 3 more, and at $5 a piece, we'll just stop at the store and get the ingredients. Overall really good dining experience, a little pricey but worth it.

OH.MY.WORD.  I have no idea where to begin.  Excellent dining experience! Great food.  Matter of fact, the apps and sides were the star of this meal.  The Breakdown:  Apps:            - Calamari. The best I've ever had. Asian inspired acccents                                melded perfectly, and the quantity was surprisingly                                adequate.       - Doz Oysters. Super fresh and delishious Malpeques. - Wagyu hot rock. Oh so tender and flavorful as it should be  Entrees:  -Sauteed Gulf   Snapper w/ crab. Über flakey and INSANE!  -Broiled  Swordfish w/  truffle fries.            Yada yada yada, super delish.  Sides:  -Truffle Mac   and cheese.         Holy tonail shredded control top pantyhose! Rich                                  and decadent and ridankulous! -Brussel sprotus. With BACON?! Need I say more?  Once again: APPS and SIDES!!!!!!

This place looks really elegant.  Great lighting, place settings and decor. Which would make me suspect if this place was authentic.  Like I've said before, and I'll say it once more: decor means nothing.  This place doesn't need it, that's how good the pho is! I could tell as soon as I stepped foot in this restaurant that it would be delish. The bouquet that smacks you in the face upon entering is a full on assault of awesomeness!  You know when you get your pho, and you stick your mug right over the bowl and you inhale those cartoon aroma hands that offer up anise, fennel and corriander? That's what you get when you enter this place! Needless to say, the Pho was excellent whether you pick the beef combo or chicken, lemongrass chicken, and fried rice (for the little one) were also superb. Very very good.  Cheers!

Always wanted to try a Fatburger ever since Ice Cube told me that he ate one at two in the morning.  Well I had my eyes did at Lasik Plus about 2 years ago which is right next to the fatburger, so after my initial consult we moseyed on over to try it out.  The burgers were aight, Thanks alot O'shea! Foo, I'm just trickin'! No, but seriously they were good, and where else can you add an egg to your burger?.  The relish was a bit strong, so I recommend that you get it on the side, or not at all.  Hey, it was clean, and the staff wasn't all loungin' around when I went. Maybe the boss was there!

First off, the entrance to this place confuses the crap outta me!  When you arrive, go to the door you THINK will lead you into the dining room, then take a 90 degree right turn and use the other door that looks like it's blocked off.  This food will do in a pinch, and it might not even satiate the craving...  The dining room was empty and they were prepping the days food, so I may have come too early....but they were.....open......  I ordered the Crispy pata (Deep fried pig trotter), and diniguan (Filipino deconstructed blood sausage is the best description I could come up with) two scoops of rice and two cokes.  The Crispy pata was over cooked and DRY!!!! I should have known when she took it out of the fridge wrapped in tin foil. Me aculpa. The Diniguan was good and tasted as it should.  I'm not sure what the total bill was, but it was definitely NOT worth it.  Very warm dining room.  Loose stools follwed shortly thereafter.

The char-crust on the burgers are friggin' ridonculous! Every bite is an explosion of flavorness and juiciness, and whichever other 'ness' you could imagine.  The Garlic fries here have utterly ruined any other chance that any other garlic fry out there would have-ever.  I have not tasted their equal anywhere! First taste brings me back to my childhood.  With it's escargot-like butter concoction, I lost my mind!  They get extra points for the pool of residue that collects at the bottom of the fry boat. My mouth is literally watering as I type...sigh  Chocolate shake rounds out the dining experience due to it's bombness! get a spoon, they're thickness.  Clearly they have more to offer, but I have found the magic equation and will stick to it.  The pizzas do look good however....

Well fuck my ozone! What a wonderful dining experience!   Started out with the Kobe and kimchi dumplings, which tasted like they didn't have any kimchi in it at all but still tasty, the INSANE pork belly! it'll make you slap yo' mama! and the yellowtail sashimi, which will make you slap yo' mama one mo' 'gin!  On the recommendation of the waitress, tried the O toro (which I've never heard of before) and it was thee best tasting, and most succulent piece of fish I have ever ever ever eaten! It was also accompanied by fresh wasabi, also, which I've never had, and I have to tell you it's so much better than whatever other wasabi you've ever tried. Ordered a second serving but was taken aback by the $50 per serving price tag when perusing the bill.  Still, well worth it!   Yuzu marinated black cod is also an OMG, for serious! Tasty, light and flakey, and just perfect!  I highly recommend this palendrome of perfection.

I wanted to review this place the first time I came, but I slacked.    In the two visits (yes two visits/ three dishes) I had the following:  #14-Hai Nam style chicken rice.  Never had this before, well now I have and I want more!  A very fresh tasting dish with an explosion of ginger, yet not too overpowering.  The accompanying sauce is ok, but the dish does fine without it.  #26-(charbroiled pork with vermicelli and egg roll).  Can't top this dish.  perfectly charred and sweet pork loin topped with cucumber, peanuts, cilantro, et al.  This dish comes in a big ass bowl, and I can tell you this dish is so good I could eat two bowls o' this junk. smack yo' momma good!  #15-House PHOnomenal- decent broth, not too fragrant, a little stingy on the meat portions, but overall a good bowl of pho  If you like lechee, they have a drink pronounced hot-ee and it has little pearls of lechee juice and tons pf basil seeds!  Really refreshing! give it a whirl.  good service, nice atmosphere, dope ass grub.

Oh d-d-d-d-dearrrrr!   I have no idea where to begin! Seriously.   Very cozy, not-so-churched up yet elegant ambience.   We sat down and were immediately greeted by Kyoko, our waitress, who got our drink orders out of the way and explained the menu to us newcomers.   Whilst perusing the menu we were pleasantly surprised with a gift of chicken liver/ port wine pâté with accompanying toast. 11/10!!!! At the expense of losing it as a free app. I strongly urge them to up the quantity and add it to the paid app list.   After we demolished the pâté, we were yet again granted manna from heaven. Gruyere popovers served with butter, sea salt, and the recipe!  So good! It was a struggle to not finished them, as I knew what was in store for the PAID apps, main and sides.   APPS:   Chef special: Escargot made with preserved Meyer lemon, garlic and  chives. Not so much traditional, but so very good =P   Roasted beets with apple and chevre. Still tastes like beets!  It was not very memorable, let's just leave it at that.   MAINS:   Spice rubbed cowboy ribeye! Oh yes. I usually go with plain steaks. No foo foo shit for me thanks. HOWEVER, I figured what the hell, I ordered the beets didn't I? When it came I immediately removed the chili butter, tasted it by itself then put it back on the steak. Pittsburgh style rare done perfectly. Accompanying head of roasted garlic and marrow bone were also friggin' spectak! =P   Cheeseburger and Fries for the dot. Pretty good burger and (whining voice) "these are too salty" cone of fries (she finished them anyway ;)) Also came with a side of really delicious cole slaw =P   Braised short ribs. Fall apart tender and just ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous! Even as a nuked leftover, every bite was as savory as the night before =P   SIDES:   I could eat the grilled asparagus all day long. ALL.DAY.LONG. my favorite by far.   Au Gratin Potatoes were tender and ooey gooey   Braised carrots were pretty standard and forgettable, eh.   Hen of the woods mushrooms were pretty good as well. Would skip next time though and replace with spinach maybe...   No room for dessert :( a damn shame because a safe assumption would be that It would've been awesome.

Oh, so delicious! Quality and service just like the one in Tucson.  What else can I say?  This time around I had the pesto with grilled chicken, and the dot had cheese pizza no sauce.  There really is not much to say that hasn't been said. AWESOME

First off, 1 star off for the Lavosh.  I had the Lavosh shawarma wrap, it was super tasty, but after eating it, it felt like I had eaten an entire box of Captain Crunch aka the world's sharpest cereal, and the roof of my mouth cursed at me. Really.   The Spanakopita (Spinach/feta phyllo concoction) and the hummus were yummskis.  reasonably priced, friendly staffed, delicious fewd.  Will def return

When I was in Iraq, we had this term called Iraqi princess. This phenomenon would turn a sub-par/ fugly girl into a goddess, this would be due to the fact that they were the only girls in Iraq .   That being said, I have to conclude that this event has been mimicked in Avondale.  Extremely slow service with only 3 other diners.  I didn't know Maruchan made pad thai! It was a pitiful, tragic attempt at a Thai staple.  The noodles were congealed into luke-warm mass of mush, and the chicken was cold.  Insipid doesn't begin to fully describle the lack of flavor in this atrocity.    The Mus Sa Mun curry was watered down, chicken was tough, potaotes were undercooked, and peanuts were few and far between.  Oh yeah, the dirt and smudges on the tile next to my table looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while.  I am completely blown away by the 2,3,4,and 5 stars this place recieved. Just because it's the only one around does not make it "royalty". I would rather eat at any fast food joint. ANY.

Bang-a-rang!  You wouldn't think looking at the dining room that good Messican grub would come out of it.  But then you'd be greatly mistaken.  It reminded me of a hip little coffe shop.   Started out with chips and salsa (you get a fresh poured bottle of red (fire roasted) and green (tomatillo)) and a side of guac. (There be bits of orange in it!!) Outstanding on all fronts!!  I did, however enjoy the green to the red.  Enter meat stuffs.  First off lemme learn you su'in right quick. Their Carne asada is not made with crappy cuts, they go for the gold and make 'em with RIBEYE!!! Oh, glorious fatty ribeye, how I adore thee...  Naco Torta. On butter grilled bread with an over-medium crown atop it. Disgustingly delicious!!  carne asada taco, conchinita taco, and shrimp taco.  All three better than any taco I've had in the past, I'd say, 6 years! Fo' Sewius.  I want to live here, that is all.

Prettyyyyyy prettyyyyyy prettyyyyyy good! Everything that's been said about the chicken and waffles is pretty much on point.  Went here for breakfast and in addition to the chicken and waffles, I had the breakfast fries (chili cheese fries topped with an egg and green onions) which were fraggin' awesome.  Opted for the sweet tea this time, and wasn't as sweet as I had expected but still good.

This go around I opted for the bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito (served all day!) and lengua (tongue), cabeza (head, and cheek meat), and carnitas (roasted pork) tacos.    The breakfast burrito was the tastiest, bacon filled treat I have ever had! I love bacon, and if you don't love it as much as I do, the bacon overload may be too much, I swear there might be more bacon than egg in this bacon bomb!  I should have figured that with a price of $2.50 per taco they would be slightly bigger than the average taqueria taco.  The size of these things are gAstronomical, and the flavor of each are equally proportional, the lengua, however,  would've probably been better if it hadn't been sitting in the cold whilst I ate the other three items!  I will no longer be eating carne asada at this place when I have the option of carnitas, cabeza, lengua, or bacon.  I advise you to do the same!

Just when I think I have had the best burger, I get to a place like the grind and prove myself wrong! This is not a bad thing though!   I usually go for the simple, regular burgers in order to put the meat up front, but the waitress recommended the sweet and spicey burger. Thank you thank you thank you! Best burger I've had to date!  French fries were good, but a lil too sweet for me.  Mac and cheese is the tits!  cheers

I think that about covers it. well, if you're like my mom and needs jokes to be explained, here we go, Barney style: Large "famous" philly (provolone wit) good sized roll, but halfway filled with barely visible onions and equally absent meat and cheese.. whilst still hungry and bored I picked up the remainder of this roll and began knocking on it!  wah wah waaaaaah

This place was a pleasant surprise!  The interior as other yelpers described it is pretty sterile, but the food is far from that!  First off I'd like to point out that Jungle Curry (which I ventured to try for the first time here)  is the epitome o' the opposite of favoritest things in the universe.  They gladly took it back and exchanged it for the Massaman Curry.  That being said, I love lamp.........and this place.  The massaman curry was rich, creamy and curryful, and with the help of the tableside chili powder bowl, all kinds of spicy!  Spicy deep fried fish? FUGGEDABOUTIT! Not a whole fish as I was expecting, and only about 6 good sized pieces, but lawd haveth mercy, it was phenoms.  The mound of fried Basil atop was a very nice and tasty touch.  Crying Tiger was the bees.  Granted I am a steak lover and the steak was cooked a little longer than it should be for medium rare, the dish was guud.

I was really excited the first time I came here, but unfortunately my experience was-well let's not get into that.   This go around I had the beef fried noodle with XO sauce and the fried tofu app. Noodle dish was awesome! Very flavorful and not greasy at all and the spicyness was right on point.  It could have used a bit more beef however.    Fried tofu was spectacks and piping hot!  had to cut 'em up to cool off a bit.  Will return, and get stuffed! cheers

Very good lechon kawali! It was great, tender, and fatty just like a good pork belly should be =9. But at $9 for the serving, it will leave you hungry for more.  Didn't try the other menu items which consisted of lumpia, bbq chicken etc. which I'm sure would be equally delicious. would be 5 stars if the money to food ratio was a tad better for a hungry dude.

I don't know what Cuban food is supposed to taste like, so, for authenticity I'm at a loss. However, I do know what good food tastes like and this food is good. I had the Vaca Frita which is a shredded beef dish served with rice and beans (separate or mixed together, I like it together) and a fried plantain.   The steak was tender and flavorful. The rice was awesome! I try and stay away from carbs as much as I can so I hated myself for eating every last grain and bean. There is something in there that I can't put my finger on that makes it ridiculous! The plantain was delectable as well.  Not open on Sundays? FAIL

OMGOMGOMG. So, I walk in and there are oldies playing on a jukebox! Perfecto.  I couldn't decide on the cheesesteak or a burger, so flip of a coin in my head and burger it was. I ordered the half pound with grilled onions and cheese. The burger was INSANE!!! I took a bite of the burger to decide whether or not I wanted to add the veggies. Get away rabbit food!!! The burger was so juicy and the flavor, THE FLAVORRR!!!!!!! This may make sense to some  of you, the burger tasted like beef! Like a great steakhouse steak, dry-aged type shit!! The fries were fresh and on point.  The guy who took my order (mike maybe?) promised a good burger, and delivered.  He promised a good cheesesteak, and I believe him. Will def return.  Cheers!

Went to get some Pho at Pho au sen today and was greeted with a Grand opening sign?...... Came in an sat down to the exact same decor but a different menu, they now have thai selections (which the server ensured me was top notch) I was a little hesitant to try a different pho than what I was craving, because I have been disappointed before.  But I said 'fuck it' and ordered the combo pho and charbroiled pork bún with vermicelli.  The menu only stated the combo had brisket, meatball  and sliced round eye. WHAT? no tendon or tripe?! Don't fret, they just left it out of the description. They're in there and still delicious.  The broth was fragrant and rich, noodles and meats were plentiful and bowls were bigger than i remember! Pork bún  was tasty and plentiful with more pork than I used to get at the old place =P  I talked with one of the servers and he told me they bought the business about 4 days ago, and made some improvements to the menu (fresher meats, bigger servings and lower prices) and from now until the 12/20/12 they are offering 20% off your bill.  Stop by and welcome your new go to spot for pho.  Pics and thai review to follow shortly.  cheers :)
