I grew up in Tucson, and this place rivals Mi Nidito in quality. Who cares if the building's a little run down? Architecture has nothing to do with flavor.  I would have my wedding catered by Carolina's, if ever that day may come!!

I recently moved to South Phoenix and have explored a few of the SM trails with my dogs. I've found that the trails are very sparsely populated on week nights, but weekends bring tons of traffic.   Mormon trail has become my favorite, and I hike it 2 to 3 times a week. It's the most easily accessible trail (from Baseline, turn South on 24th street and it meanders to the trial's generous parking lot). The trail inclines right from the beginning, and there are very few flat parts. It's a GREAT cardio workout. The first several times I had to take a few breaks to catch my breath. It takes about 30 minutes (1 mile) to get to the part that loops to the National trail, which is where I turn around. There is usually a fair amount of traffic but everyone is super friendly.   Kiwanis trail is lovely (accessed via Central, followed signs). It's in a "crack" between two hills, making it almost completely shaded, ideal in the summer. The shade also facilitates different plant life than on other trails. It ends with a "staircase" that would be great training for hiking the Canyon. It leads to the road that goes up to the top of the mountain. If you cross the road, you connect with Telegraph pass on the left, or you can hike to the hut on the right.   I did Holbert Trail on Silent Sunday (access via activity center). It was packed, and we were constantly passing unleashed dogs, unicyclists, large families leisurely strolling, etc. We hiked about an hour up and reached a lovely summit. The trail itself was beautiful and somewhat challenging, but I would not recommend on a weekend if serenity is what you seek.   Ranger trail is my favorite so far (access near Central/ mile marker 1). The views around sunset are amazing, and the switchbacks get your heart pumping, and really motivate you to see what's around the next corner.   I walked Las Lomitas Loop (accessed where it intersected Ranger) for about an hour, and never found where it loops to. It was ok, lots of up and down rocky river banks, but doesn't vary much in elevation or go up the mountain (that I saw, anyway) so the views aren't as good as other trails.   In February I hiked Alta trail. My first attempt I made it about 45 minutes up and didn't feel well and turned around. My second attempt I was eager to hike the whole thing, which is 4.5 miles! Including the .5 mile walk from the parking lot and up the closed road to the trail head, it was ten miles total. The first part is kind of boring and barren, but once you get to the top you can see the city on one side and the res on the other side. The trail wanders up and down and up and winds around the mountain side. I was thankful that I brought plenty of water and my headlamp as I hiked out in the dark. I was super sore but also super proud at this accomplishment.   All of the trails are fairly well marked, well maintained, and often cross a road or two so it never feels remote (for a single woman, this is a benefit).

I like both locations. Tempe is super convenient, and the Chandler studio offers lake views from the large (windowed) classroom.   I prefer level 1-2, level 2, and flow classes, averaging about 3 classes a week, to get my money's worth of the monthly auto-pay for $119. Having practiced at Inner Vision for about two years, my physical and mental wellbeing has drastically improved! I now can do many difficult postures, including inversions and tricky arm balances.  I would go more often if they offered intermediate-level classes more frequently in the evenings and weekends with my preferred instructors (some level 1-2 instructors are too easy, and I dislike one popular instructor). I definitely have a short list of favorites, but everyone is at a different level, and they do their best to cater to all.   Overall, I highly recommend.

HORRIBLE gel polish job !!!! Before we started I asked her to make sure it's very clean around the cuticles. She slapped everything on in a huge hurry and the bottles of gel polish were nearly empty. She was trying to get every last drop out of those bottles and spent no time trying to apply it properly. She could tell I was unhappy and I told her it looked very messy around the cuticles. She then use that cuticle clippy  thing to try to cut the messiness away, and made one of my fingers bleed. Looks/ feels really bad. Then she tried to blame it on my "dry cuticles". Unbelievable. I'm sure it will peel off within days, which is actually a good thing in this case. I'm in a wedding tonight, i'm leaving for vacation at 6 AM tomorrow. I'm going to have to hide my hands.

NOT FOR VEGGIES!  I was super eager to try this infamous place. I met my family (5 adults and 2 toddlers) here at 6 pm on a Saturday after hiking South Mountain. The wait was about 20 minutes, which was fine. The d√©cor was fun and festive, far from fancy.  All 7 of us squished into a booth. The service was fair, though they handed us the check without asking if we wanted dessert (we did). For some reason this caused our server tons of confusion. The chips and salsa were good. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, which was just okay.  My family seemed to really like their meals. The sopapilla was good, just simple. My family liked the flan.  However, the menu had NOTHING vegetarian-- the beans are made with lard and the rice and enchilada sauce has chicken stalk. The tortillas likely had lard too.  I ate chips and salsa for my meal. I was deeply saddened, as I was starving for a cheese enchilada or a bean burrito after a 2 hour hike. In this day and age it baffles me that a restaurant can't put together ONE vegetarian option. Plenty of other authentic Mexican places are able, why not Los Dos? I'll never return :(

Yes, their pastries are amazing. I love their vanilla bean iced coffee, which is a major diet splurge.The egg sandwich is good (though way overpriced). But their other food is hit and miss. Granted, I've only had their veggie options so I'm a bit biased.   Overall, the portions are tiny and way overpriced, and  the service is often slow and rude. The owner is nice, as are a couple of the employees, but there are several cashiers who don't even have the manners to say "please" or "thank you"!!   Usually I call ahead and pick it up, and when i get there they scramble to put everything together. Today I dropped in without calling, which I will never do again. I ordered, and the cashier said, "$9.75." No "please." No "thank you" for payment. So rude! I sat down and I watched about 5 people who ordered after me get served their meals.  When I asked the cashier after 20 minutes, then again after 35 minutes for her to check on my order, she coldly said, "we're backed up," without even checking, without a single apology! Finally I flagged down a polite cook to check on my food, who brought it right out to me at room temperature. Yes, they were slammed, and I can empathize. But why on earth didn't they give me a heads-up when I ordered, or give me an update after 15 minutes, or at the very least, APOLOGIZE? It's extremely upsetting to spend so much time and money at their establishment and be treated like this.   Today I got the $9 veg special and they gave me a small salad, a yummy round croissant thing, and a soup the size of a cappuccino. The 3 spoonfuls were delicious, but come ON!! Would it kill them to be a tad more generous?  Also, they don't have decent vegetarian options, which is insane considering how proud they are of their organic food. Now they have Vegetarian Tuesdays, which is the only day I eat here because I've tried every veg option and nothing is satisfying: Their meal salads are ok, but lack protein (adding nuts, beans, tofu, or even cheese would make it a meal). The side salad is a joke: a few leaves of lettuce and vinaigrette-- that's it-- no tomato, no onion, no crouton, no cheese, no dressing options -- just lettuce with oil and vinegar. The grilled veggie sandwich is slimy. The Mediterranean platter is greasy. And their grilled cheese sucks-- the mozzarella is like melted plastic (see below). Their hummus plate is served with ample crusty oil-drenched bread but only 2 tablespoons of hummus!  I have a small appetite and eat healthily and I still feel gypped and/or grease-sodden every time.   What bothers me more than anything is their holier-than-thou elitist attitude. A few times I've made suggestions and they clearly have zero interest in making improvements. My helpful attitude is always met with an insolent dismissal. Among them: have cheese options for the grilled cheese (they refused), and sell the mini macarons as singles, for those of us who don't like to blow our entire meal calorie count on dessert (they claimed that's too labor intensive... yet, if they sold 3 of them an hour it would pay the hourly wage for an additional employee).    That they're closed evenings and on Sundays, and sometimes for a week or more at a time, is a major negative too. As is their too tiny location and horrific parking situation.  I only eat here because there are no other options for organic, locally-farmed food options in the area. If they were in a larger city, or even if they were in a hipper part of this city, they may not survive.

Good nails but RUDE MANAGERS! Don't bother making an appointment!  The first time I went to Pink Polish was 3 weeks ago. I noticed that the (male) managers couldn't be bothered to express even an inkling of customer service. I was told (not asked) to sign in, and I got assigned a nail tech right away. She was sweet and did a FANTASTIC job--the best gel nails I've ever had. She made sure all the edges were cleaned up around my cuticles which is super important to me, as it leaves me no reason to pick at them and they last the full 10-14 days. While i was getting my mani, I overheard some techs lauging about one of the managers acting all suave. As if on command, he saddled up to me and complimented my yoga outfit and my nail color choice. I found it odd, but whatever. Just another flirt in a fedora.   But when I checked out, the managers were counting their profits at the front desk, and ran my card without looking at me or saying a WORD. I said please and thank you, and they remained completely silent, as if I wasn't even there. It made me think twice about returning, but my mani held up for a full 2 weeks so I figured I'd give them another shot.  So, about 2 weeks later, when my mom wanted to treat me to a mani-pedi a few days after I had an appendectomy, I suggested we go to PP.  I called at 10 am and made an appointment for us for 11:30. Again, no please or thank you on the phone. He said "OK" and hung up.  We arrived at 11:28 and there were about 5 girls who had walked in right in front of us without appointments. They were all tended to right away. The place was already packed (President's Day). We signed in and stood there waiting for the walk-ins to pick out their polish and to be seated at the nail bar or pedi chairs.   Finally, a manager came back to the front desk. We told him we had appointments and he told (not asked) us to go sit in the far end of the lobby, as if we were in their way. He didn't seem to hear us say we had an appointment, so I repeated it nicely. He said, "12:45 right?" And i said, "no, 11:30." (wtf? why would we come an hour and 15 minutes early to an appointment?!). It was now 11:40. Clearly he hadn't actually given us appointments at all when I called. This place is first come first served, without even the appearance of tending to those with appointments first.   We waited 10 more minutes until a manager finally told us to go sit down at the pedi chairs. The foot bath water was room temperature and felt gross. After a while, a tech came over to us and she seemed super stressed out. She asked me (but not my mom) to pick which pedi I wanted. I looked at the menu and selected "basic pedi." She didn't seem to like this answer and barked, "You decide!" and left with no explanation. Apparently "basic pedi" would not allow her to reach her daily upsale quota. My mom and I stared at each other, totally shocked, and at the same time, we said, "Let's go!" It was now 11:50 and she didn't even have a nail tech yet.  My mom dried off her feet and then mine (I'm post-op disabled), and when we were leaving, my tech ran up, clearly upset that we were leaving. Like, scared for her life upset, and asked us to please go sit. My mom looked at the managers and said, "We're leaving and aren't coming back. You guys are rude." The whole place heard us and the managers said nothing.   We then drove down the street and got our mani-pedis at a different, less fancy, less overpriced, much friendlier salon.     It seems as if the managers are so obsessed with their profits that they think it's ok to treat customers like dog turds, and they work their employees into a panicked frenzy that borders on abuse. I don't blame the techs for any of this; they are sweet and work their fingers off. The managers seem like cocky slave drivers, and I refuse to support this business. I suggest you do the same. However, if you can tolerate the managers' complete lack of respect, and want to support their abusive treatment of workers, by all means, go ahead!

The drinks are well made, and the employees are very friendly. But they are friendly to a fault. Inside, they never seem to have a sense of urgency like most locations. They really like chatting with customers, which is nice, but Starbucks is supposed to be FAST! Friendliness is appreciated, but this is excessive. I still go here once or twice a week (only when I can afford 15 minutes), but I will never use the drive-through again. Both times I used the drive thru it took over ten minutes.  The first time was understandable, as it was in the morning, and there were a few cars ahead of me. The second time was at 2 in the afternoon on a week day. There was one car at the window, none in the parking lot, so I decided to grab a quick iced tea on my way back from lunch. I ordered and pulled forward, and the employee was hanging out the window chatting with the customer in front of me for THIRTEEN minutes (yes, my eye was on the clock) before they even handed them their drink.  This chick was laughing, reaching in and petting the dogs thru the windows, just hanging out?! Talking about her own dogs?? And how unsanitary!! And I was just sitting there, and sitting, and sitting ....  When the customer's drink came, the customer sent it back to be remade (I could hear that they wanted hot, not iced). This chick was too busy chatting to pay attention to their initial order, and then had to remake it!! There is no excuse; they had no other customers!  I put my car into reverse and backed out of the looooonnnnnng drive through in a huff, as they made me late getting back to work from lunch and I wasn't willing to sit there another ten minutes. Having worked many years in the customer service industry, it's infuriating to me when people take their sweet time, sitting around socializing, when they should be servicing all customers.

Though I like the pharmacist, the pharm techs at this location have the WORST customer service! Several times they did not fill my Rx within 24 hours, for different reasons. Never did they call me or my doctor and try to resolve the situation ... they just waited till I showed back up to inform me there was a problem. No apologies, not even a smile.   The pharmacist once overheard me telling the tech that I had come back three times and my Rx still hadn't been filled. He offered me a gift card and apologized for my trouble, and I was very grateful. But really, me having to return three times for an Rx I fill every month? Inexcusable.   Once I walked up to the RX counter inside the store to ask where to find an OTC medicine. I was sick, could barely function, and the tech didn't even look up from her cell phone ... she just said, "Isle ten." I said, "I looked in isle ten and didn't see it." She totally ignored me and kept texting!! I muttered, "Thanks for nothing," and stumbled away. Thankfully the same sweet pharmacist saw the interaction and dropped what he was doing to come and help me.   There's a creepy tech with a greezy skullett that is rude every time (he has screwed up my Rx twice). Now he just takes my money and shoves my Rx through the window at me.   If it wasn't for the exemplary pharmacist, and the close proximity to my house, I would never return to this location.

This place rules! It's just great beer, wine, booze ... plus they have a cozy couch, and it draws a diverse crowd. Five stars for my  five favorite things.

This was the best, most pleasant, comfortable dentist visit of my life.  Allegedly there is free valet parking but I couldn't find it, so I parked at a meter right outside their door. As other reviewers said, the small staff of 3 are all very cool. The office just opened in Feb. 2010, and they use the newest technology (they said they are the only ones in AZ with their x-ray equipment). The x-rays were done right in the chair and the results were instantly displayed on the monitor for me to see. The lovely hygenist immediately erased my anxiety. The cleaning went very fast and was painless, and she actually complimented me on the health of my teeth! This was a huge relief considering its been about 2 years since my last cleaning (and that quack of a dentist claimed I needed gobs of work, which I thankfully ignored). I had two spots that I was certain would require drastic treatment, but the hygenist and dentist assured me they  were no big deal. They showed me fancy photos of the areas that worried me, and left it up to me whether I wanted to treat one issue, and the other issue they assured me was totally fine. NEVER has a dentist actually talked me OUT of getting work done!! Amazing! Also, all the paperwork is filed and appointments are made online.   Easy peasy. I'm raving to all of my friends and family about this place.  GO!

The Mini Cooper has always been my dream car. After my faithful 2006 Scion XA was totaled in an accident, I test drove just about every high-scoring 2013 subcompact car in my price range (~$17,000 msrp: Fiat 500, Honda Fit, Mazda 2, Kia Rio, Ford Fiesta), but I didn't want to drive the Mini because I didn't think I could afford it. I was not thrilled with any of them (though I did like the retro adorableness and color choices of the Fiat 500, but it felt too flimsy, and the mazda 2 was super fun to drive, but too sporty looking). They were all good cars, but they all just felt ho-hum.    I realized that any other car besides the Mini would be settling, so I made the bold decision to finally visit the MINI of Tempe dealership. My heart sank when it was verified that new models were WELL over my budget, but then I was introduced to a certified pre-owned 2011 base model in my preferred color with only 23k miles, which was comparable in price to the  others, and I got excited.  When I test drove it, I knew it was THE ONE!!! The salesman, Josh, was very personable, low-pressure, and sweet. I went home to do more research, crunch numbers, and sleep on it. I found that the asking price was on par with KBB, and Edmunds and Consumer Reports rated the mini base model very highly. Additionally, Josh had explained that MINI's certified pre-owneds come with an extended warranty, so I was sold.  The next day I met up with Josh again, made an offer,negotiated, and he worked it out with his manager behind the scenes and it was painless. I still splurged a little, but it's worth it to be driving my dream car!! I grin every time I see it, and giggle when I drive it. I can't even believe that it's mine.

Duong answered all of my questions over the phone before I scheduled my appointment. I arrived a little late and he didn't seem to mind (I was the only client in the whole salon as it was Memorial Day). He was incredibly patient and friendly.  He even ran down to put change in my meter!! He said ordinarily the front desk gives clients parking permits.   The nail salon is in the upstairs open loft inside the Pink hair salon, which is located in that new complex off Apache between Rural and McAllister, across from the SRC. There were lots of 20 year olds strutting through the courtyard in bathing suits. Inside, the salon has urban decor.  I got glitter gel on my fingers and toes (it was difficult to choose among tons of color options. I chose blush pink for my toes and copper for my fingers). It was a long process--about six coats of gel, one generous dusting of glitter sandwiched between, and UV curing with each layer.  It looks amazingly sparkly and I cant stop staring at my hands and feet!! He did meticulous work and I highly recommend NBM. It has only been open for a few months and he said it is very slow in the summer ... so take advantage!

What I keep reading in these reviews is complaints about scheduling and customer service (and frankly, most of these patients sound rude). There's only one review that questions an injectable procedure (and it sounds like it was quickly resolved). Such few negative reviews on injectables is actually extremely rare for med spas!! They do great work at 2 Drops! And they really go above and beyond to give excellent service; just look at all of Marilyn's replies to these reviews, or call Kim (mgr) and have a conversation.  So here's my story.  I've been coming to 2 Drops for Botox since the beginning--2012ish. The staff has always been fantastic--kind, patient with my budgeting obstacles, and always gracious and grateful for my loyalty.  I had mixed experiences the first year from different doctors, but then Sassy (RN) came on board and she's always done a perfect job.   I always get botox, but in May 2015 i got voluma. It looked awesome immediately after treatment. When I called in crying a couple days later because I had some hideously droopy looking puffy eyelids, they brought me in right away, and the girls & Sassy had tons of compassion. Sassy called a colleague and brainstormed solutions, and ruled out any crazy reactions. We all decided that it must just be swelling/ bruising traveling upwards, and that I needed to completely eliminate salt, stay upright, keep using ice packs, and drink tons of fluids. I did just that, & the next day I was markedly better.  I keep going back because they are seriously great people. Sure, sometimes I have to wait what feels like too long (to get an appointment, or waiting to see Sassy), but they are always apologetic. I completely understand the fluidity and subjectivity people enforce on time. Now i know to book 3-4 months ahead, & that when I'm there, some patients need extra time w Sassy (because sometimes I do, too). So i schedule my life accordingly. No biggie!   Be beautiful on the inside, too, ladies & gents! Practice kindness and compassion!! Others will reciprocate!
