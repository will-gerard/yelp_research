Probably not the prettiest shop, but super friendly... they get to know you by name just after a few times. If your nail breaks or a issue they will fix for free with no arguing. The only negative thing I can say, I am not a huge fan of two of the ladies nail art or how they do a pedi. I just stay clear of them. I love Julie and Jillian.

Was very unhappy after just going yesterday. My husband dropped off our battery to see if it needed recharged and we said we would be back in a couple hours. "we are trying to see if we had a bad battery or alternator" ..... so I come back to get battery the guy goes what kind of battery you have... i say I dont know my husband brought it in. I asked do you guys put a name on them, he goes usually then brings me a battery thinking it's mine.... i then asked how do you know if its mine .. he goes it must be ... I then called my husband and he said we had a walmart battery... this one was but just the attitude and not caring wether they gave me the right battery or not made me never want to go there again... even the manager on duty did not seem to care .. like well here is a battery and its good so be on .. like I was annoying him .... long story short always loved auto zone .......but not this one .....

Just last Friday night I had an extremely bad encounter at School of Rock I literally ran out of the club begging for police help the police officer drove away then I made a horrible decision to stand in the middle of the road way to get a police officer to stop the next thing I know I'm being slammed to the ground handcuffed and placed in a paddy wagon and sent to jail while in jail I was treated horribly by the detention officers nobody would take my statement or care to listen to what happened to me at the club I then got thrown down to the ground by another woman detention officer after trying to tell her my story I repeatedly begged for somebody to take my statement they treated me as if I was just a drunken crazy person still yet to this day have I got any one to call me back or to do anything about all the bruises all over my body and about how badly I was treated then I got a ticket for obstruction of traffic I was a woman that was sexually attacked at School of Rock ran out of the club to get away from the men begging for please help and this is how was treated still have not been able to make a statement and still waiting to hear from the general manager named Kevin from School of Rock if you are in need of police help I would not count on the Tempe police to be there for you they treat everyone as if they're just a drunk idiot

I love this place and so does my hubby summer or winter we are there at least twice a month. The staff is pretty friendly, we met the owner once he seemed busy but other than that ok.

My hubby and I decided to try something new, so he suggested this place. Said a bunch of his co-workers go there and he always wanted to try. He had the philly cheesesteak with fries ..... very tasty and the fries were very good just a tad cold... I had the chicago gyro with a side greek salad.... soooooooo yummy the meat was seasoned just right and soooo much of it ... i had to give some to my hubsters :)  very good and will be back .... extra plus is 2 miles from my house!!

My husband and I visited this location on Saturday, I had a appointment to get all 4 tires replaced on our newer car. When we showed up Jeff was our guy to help. I asked him at that time could we also do a oil change, fix a tire and do brakes on my husbands car. He added it on with no hesitation.  They called to give updates and were very nice, and honest. I usually don't like going to these places because in the past I felt like i was nickled and dimed for every little thing. Here I felt like I was darn near family to them and they were only doing work that was needed. I felt very comfortable and a valued customer. Not to mention I feel like Jeff gave us a great deal and saved us money. We had a lot of work done on both vehicles and left very pleased. I will always come back to Jeff and Big O tires from now on out for service. Thank you !!!

I'm not a fan of all the new hires I wish all the old people would or could come back they were way more sociable and fun with regulars, the new staff are uptight and treat you poorly unless you're an old perverted man that's basically tipping them... they have no sense of humor and it's sad to see that its reflecting on some of the old bartenders as well, my husband and I have been coming there for over 12 years on party nights on regular days for lunch etc in the last two years I've been there maybe 3 or 4 times and my husband's gone every few months and we have almost always had an issue with one of the waitresses. I'm drawing the straw I'm never going again since last Friday we went and I was joking with the waitress not to give my husband cheese fries because he's on a diet and she decided to get uptight about it tell the bartender day which then he ended up calling me a b**** and then the next thing I know I'm getting kicked out because she thought I was being rude to her. Last time I checked you're in a bar where people are going to joke and kid around and have fun and maybe you shouldn't hire such sensitive young girls that can't handle it. BTW the waitress was ashley.

I've tried this place over and over and over since they took over rally's again they have yet to satisfy me on my receipt says exactly what I want but they always get my food wrong I always ask for the same thing super nachos with extra Pico I'll either get with no pico or no meat or no cheese or something messed up again right now tonight I go and try one more time because my husband seems to like them which I have no clue why and I ask for the same meal super nachos with extra Pico I get chips with nothing but beans guacamole and sour cream on it and extra beans like wow this is not a difficult order why can you not get it right I am NOT wasting no more of my time or money coming here anymore!! Please do not waste your time or money on them just go down the street a little bit of the ways and go to Los favoritos they are always on point and never get it wrong!!!!!!

was pretty good for our first time. The manager / supervisor on duty was helpful with picking out a fun drink and gave advice on a meat to pick. We wanted to try crawfish since we have never had but they did not have it in. I assume a seasonal thing. But we did have the blue crab and mussels... delish .. will have to come back when they have crawfish for sure.

The food and drinks were great, the service was as good as it could be. I think the place is still new and possibly the staff too. There were a couple hiccups with our order, and then wrong checks being paid for. But all of this was corrected and the manager I believe brough our whole table a round of yummy shots to make it up :)  We will def come back when we are in downtown phoenix again.
