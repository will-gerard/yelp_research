I only gave one start because there isn't a "no star" option. This particular Zales is lacking in customer service big time. If a lady named Hope is helping you... RUN! I wouldn't even recommend my worst enemy to shop at this store.

Got a groupon for 3 works car washes for Francis and Sons car wash. Typically I go to the one off of 79th ave and Thunderbird (they are great) but when I pulled up to this location there was no one there to greet or any signs to direct customers. When we finally found an employee he was fast asleep and we had to wake him to get service. The issues don't stop there. I paid for a full service car wash and I ran my car though the wash and all they did was dry it... Do not come here!

Very disappointed with the customer service and couldn't help but feel like I was bother. From placing my name at the hostess booth, to getting a table, to placing our order felt like a big inconvenience to the staff here. Does not make a for a nice atmosphere to enjoy our food. I used to love this very popular breakfast spot but I will not be coming back.

We have been going here for a while... Then a groupon came up for FuNuGyz so I purchased it because we were heading there with a party of 3. We get there and I show them the groupon and they say they can only honor it for parties of 8 or more... I must have misread the groupon!!!! So we were just going to cancel with groupon and get my money back... but we couldn't. Now I'm sitting here with a groupon that I can't use that I already spent money on!!! Needless to say I am frustrated! Now this is where this business goes above and beyond... They talk with us and I tell them I can't cancel the groupon so they HONNOR the groupon!!! No questions asked! FunNuGyz is definitely here for their customers! :-)

We came home from vacation to find our AC unit running but nothing coming from the vents. We found Boldt on Yelp and called. Phillip answered right away and we had him at our house in about an hour. He inspected our system and showed me exactly what was wrong and we went over a few options to fix it and he gave me a quote. He arrived the next morning soon as the rain cleared and fixed our system. (this was on the day of the insane rainstorm that flooded everything in Phoenix). He was very pleasant and professional and the work got done at a VERY reasonable price (exactly the amount quoted). 100% calling him again if ever our system goes down.

My husband and I got married a year ago at Windmill Winery and we picked Lesley's Creative Cakes to do our wedding cake. Not only was the cake delicious but the styling of the cake was perfect! She was able to create the image of the perfect cake that I had in my head and bring it to life.  We had a great experience with Lesley's Creative Cake!!
