Goo selection of stores and I love people watching at this mall. Try chevy's next to the food court. Great tacos and cadillac margaritas and happy hour. Great deal.

A great place to go see some pretty cool animals!! Make sure to feed the lorrys during their feeding times. Its pretty cool. The Dragon World exhibit is really cool too. Tickets are pretty expensive. $16 for just the zoo and $31 for the zoo and aquarium.

There is a Starbucks right next door, so whenever I grab a coffee I'll usually stop in here for a bite to eat. (great decision for a location.) I usually grab a lox bagel and its always nice. It has the usual; smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, and onions. Never a complaint....although to give a full review I probably should try something else too :)

Always have a great selection and a great place to start getting crafty :) They always have sales of some kind going one and tons of clearance things too! I guess they're trying to make room for more cool stuff!!

Amazing food. I love coming here!! Its one of those places I can only afford every once in a while, but when I do its awesome. Try the bacon wrapped, blue cheese filet with port soaked mushrooms...wow...melts in your mouth.

Has about everything you need, but forget about asking for help. The employees are not very helpful.

Great selection of produce and specialty items. If you have food allergies, this place has a nice variety of great alternatives. The specialty food is a little pricey, but that;s to be expected. Go on Wednesdays!!! They have the deals from the previous week and the upcoming week every Wednesdays.

They have pretty decent and authentic Mexican food. Pretty large menu so lots of options. I bit on the pricey side, but they make up for it by having 99 cent margaritas on Wednesdays.

Long long long lines and employees are helpful but dont seem very happy. It must be all the older people from sun city who I see fighting with them.

This is not a sports bar. Its a wanna be club and it's horrible. Expensive drinks.

Ok...2nd review. After coming back a few times, the place doesn't seem all that bad. Bartenders are cool and can make a good drink. Plus street tacos on the patio on the weekends. Karaoke during the week is fun.Could still do without the club/ dance music though.

I love going here. The place is kind of hidden, but it's awesome! Always clean and the therapists have always been amazing. Sometimes you don't even have to tell them what you want worked on, they  just find the problem and take care of it. Definitely recommend this place.

I love this place! I've eaten here quite a few times and love going. The food is always fresh and tasty. I love their spring rolls, pho, and banh mis. My family is Vietnamese so I thought I'd be daring and bring my grandma here one day. She liked it, but said it wasnt as good as hers....and I do agree.....BUT its a great substitute if grandma is taking the day off :)

The BBQ is great at this place. Pulled pork, burnt ends, ribs...etc. It is awesome. The sides though are definitely lacking. My mashed potatoes and gravy and macaroni and cheese looked like they came from a frozen dinner. BUT....the BBQ makes it worth it...just go with the fries to be safe for your side. Also, if its available, sit next to the shark tank. Its really cool.

Went for wine Wednesday and to have some dinner. Decor is nice in the bar but tacky in the dining area. I asked for a wine list and was given a piece of paper with the server's handwriting on it. I declined the wine after that but the others I went with ordered some. The server came back to say that the wine they had ordered was not available this evening. They ordered a different glass. The server came back again and said that was also not available.    My party settled on a wine that was available and after delivering it the server said she needed to do her paperwork and asked if we were done. I guess so lady! So we went in for wine Wednesday for wine and dinner and left with having cheap wine and no dinner. Will not be going back.

Very helpful employees and awesome interest rates on car loans! They have bankers who actually ask questions and help you. This credit union isn't just about making money, they're about helping you.

Great place to hangout, especially with large groups. Laser tag, arcade, bowling, 3 full bars, VIP section, lounge, sports area with huge screens, and a pretty good restaurant. We seriously needed something like this in Surprise. I only with they were open later during the week.
