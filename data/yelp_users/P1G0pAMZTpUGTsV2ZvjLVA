I have been going to Dobson Lakes Chiropractic for about 10 years & Dr. Anthony is simply AMAZING!!!!  In my opinion very few places treat customers like family anymore yet, Dr. Anthony & his staff make me feel just like family! Also I never feel pressured to purchase anything or to try anything outside my comfort level. I KNOW my best interest is their #1 priority!

My first time at Thy Nails was on Wednesday and it was fantastic! My friend Liz has been there a few times before so when I told her that I wanted to get my nails done with her she recommended that we go to Thy Nails.  I was a couple of minutes behind my friend but when I got there I was welcomed and had a seat and nail tech ready for me to get my pedi! The massage was great...not the best but pretty good! I told the girl that I wanted a french pedi and that I wanted a design but I wasn't sure what I wanted...she put a cute flower and silver gem in the middle. It was perfect! After my pedi I got a mani! I don't think I've ever had my nails look so amazing!  They were cut at the perfect length and are shaped so beautifully. I can't stop looking at them!! The price was great too....$50 for my fill and pedi! :) I HIGHLY recommend going here! It's worth the drive to see these talented and friendly ladies!

Seriously, how does this place have so many wonderful reviews? All I experienced was bad service.  I called a couple of weeks ago and explained that we needed to rush a couple of bridesmaid alterations because a couple of my girls were coming in a week before the wedding I asked if that would be a problem & was told no. I also asked for a rough number as to what it may cost and was told $55 at the most but it would probably be closer to $25. I know that it totally depends on what needs to be done etc but it ended costing one girl $75 and another $100! Anyway, I made appointments for two of the girls and figured we would be good to go. Boy, was I wrong!  One of my girls was able to come into town earlier then expected so I called the store to ask if I could have her come in early. To my surprise there was NO appointments scheduled for either girl! They said they only schedule appointments for brides. They told me to have one of the girls come in anyway. We went in and they told us the dress wouldn't be done in time! WHAT?!?!?  She said they were over booked already but they could "make a special acception". They said it would be done by Saturday at 3:30pm but to come back first thing Saturday morning to have her try on the dress again so they can see where they are going to hem it exactly. They went in this morning and were asked if they had an appointment?!?!? Well no cause last time you said that you don't schedule appointments for anyone except for brides and YOU told us to come back Saturday morning. This place could not be any less organized. Horrible service, horrible price, horrible customer service. For what we paid I was expecting WAY better! Unfortunately we do not recommend them and will never be back.

My dog and I love going to this PetSmart  location! We have used both the training and Banfield (the pet hospital) at this location.   PetSmart Training- *Chris is the best and has a solution to almost any situation! *My dog LOVES visiting with Chris. If my dog and I are at PetSmart when we are not going for a class she gets very excited and wants to go into the training room! *Even if I have not enrolled my dog into a class for a while I can still as Chris training questions  Banfield-  Piece of advice, enroll your animals in one of the health plans. We have saved THOUSANDS of dollars by doing so especially when our dog was a puppy. The puppy plan included all the vaccinations and getting her fixed. We had an incident with our dog where she had something wrong with her ear. I took her to Banfield and then realized Banfield had just closed. I was debating if I should take my dog to the Animal Hospital right up the street then I saw one of the receptionists come out of the back. I said "I know you guys closed down a little bit ago but I am not sure what to do, could you look at her ear and let me know what you would do about this?" She told me not to worry and she went in the back to get a nurse. The nurse looked at her ear and told me this was something that would be ok to wait until tomorrow for (since the doctor was gone for the evening). I was so thankful for them taking the time after hours to look at her. Two things to be aware of-sometimes it takes a while to get into a room or for the doctor to come in (which is out of their control) & they are not 24 hours (which is also out of their control since PetSmart itself is not open 24/7)

My boyfriend and I went to the Melting Pot tonight to enjoy our Groupon that we bought a couple of weeks ago. This is the second time that we have been here in the past couple of months. The last time we were here our service was phenomenal and it was a real experience. Our waitress was so interactive and joking with us, it was a real treat. Unfortunately this time it wasn't so great. Our waitress was Megan and she was nice but defiantly left us on our own. She asked if we had been there before and we said yes. She then asked what we would like to order. That was fine except for it felt kinda awkward. She kept trying to upgrade us and was very short with us. I honestly felt like I was dining at an Applebee's not The Melting Pot. I think we saw our server a total of 10 minutes during our entire visit. All the other times before that we have gone we have always left feeling like we had a great waitress/ great conversation/great food but tonight did not live up to those standards. We also ended up adding things to our groupon so we spent quite a bit of money but both of us agreed if we decided to go back we would not have Megan as our server. A place like that should be more interactive and fun... Things shouldn't just be given to you and have the waitress walk off without opening her mouth at all. I believe she said the bare minimum of what is "required" & she wasn't personable at all. We actually almost asked for another server cause we were so disappointed. If the place is going to charge so much for their food then they should really live up to their expectations more & create a better, memorable experience.

The melting pot went above and beyond to make our experience amazing! I received a call from the manager and was told that our waitress had injured her arm that same night so she was in pain. (Completely understandable) he welcomed us back and we went a couple of nights after valentines day. We got a private booth and had a great night.  Thank you Melting Pot!

Quality nails? Ya right... This name needs to be changed. My BFF and I went to "Quality" nails the other day to get a full. The lady seemed nice but she was SUPER fast to the point that it made me nervous. Then she finished and I looked at my nails.... They looked horrible! You can see my real nail under the fake nail. Since I had a French manicure I asked her to paint the tips white... She said Oh that'll be $13 extra... Really lady? I explained that I have engagement pictures coming up and that I want them to be perfect. She just said "ok for extra I can fix". I couldn't believe it! First time customer and I have to pay extra to have the tips as a French manicure... So I just got up to check out.  She said "ok that'll be $22, do you want to leave a tip?" I said "sure $25 total" she goes "$27?" I go "no you heard me, $25, if your not ok with that then you are not getting a tip at all" she talked to her other family in whatever flippin language they speak and I just said I will be going somewhere else with better quality next time. They suck so just don't even bother!

I wish I could give a higher review but I just can't. I came to St. Joes for surgery a couple of weeks ago with Dr. Hibner (he is absolutely fantastic btw). My check in was smooth and the nurses were very nice to me. I went into surgery and everything was great! They even called my boyfriend to let him know that surgery had started.  Once I woke up I was in ICU/recovery. My nurse there was AMAZING as well. Everything changed once I got to my room for the night. My nurse Smitha was absolutely horrible. She had no bedside manor and was very rough with me. At one point she did a ultra sound on my bladder (I had surgery on my abdomen) and she was pushing very hard right under my incisions. I told her she was being too rough and she said she needed to do this. She could've easily gone down a little lower to check my bladder, directly under my incisions was not necessary. At one point she asked what my pain level was and I told her a 7. She smirked and walked away. She also told me I could just lay in bed and do nothing all night. I have had this surgery 2 other times and know to avoid pain in the shoulders it is best to get up and walk around. So my boyfriend helped me do this. I really just think she didn't want to do her job. Plenty of other people are looking for jobs, so why do nurses like her work for such a well known facility? Hopefully they can get better workers in their hospital before too long. After such wonderful treatment at first I was so disappointed to get such a insensitive nurse.

Review from 6/21/16: This is a horrible hospital. The only reason why I have gone here for 3 surgeries is due to my surgeon, Dr. Michael Hibner. My husband and I have absolutely no fear about my surgery (which should be the scariest part) we are terrified of my aftercare. I was yelled at, hurt and frankly abused by staff during my last stay. The staff does not care about the patients well being. You see "hello human kindness" everywhere in the hospital but sadly, its more like "hello? Where is the human kindness?" We were yelled at and veebally abused by a security guard named Larry. Late one night my husband and I decided to go to the vending machines located in the cafeteria since I was not able to eat dinner. Larry came down there and said we were not allowed to be there. He said security has been warned about us cause we had left the room many times today and were not listening. I said that he musthave had us confused with another patient cause we had not left the room at all that day and we were just trying to get something to eat. He told us that we were trouble makers and we needed to go back to our room. We asled if my husband could get me some chips before we went back up and he said no. I said again that I had not eaten and he said "well thats not my problem!" We walked away tp head back to the elevators and he kept egging us on by saying "ya thats right, keep walking to your room!" And "just keep walking, go faster". Keep in mind that I was a slow walker since I just had surgery the day before. It was very unacceptable treatment. We called his boss up there right after and he said that was unacceptable and he was very shocked. We also spoke to rhe head of security about this issue the next day and he couldn't believe it. This was just one of the hossible things that we had happen at St. Josephs hospital during our 2 night stay.  Whatever you do-- DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOSPITAL!!!!   08/14:wish I was able to increase my review but I simply cannot. I filed a complaint with st. Joe's and I got a call back from a manager. She insisted that Smitha was the best nurse that she had and that I couldn't have had "THAT bad of an experience". I was shocked that I didn't get any apology or anything from them. She didn't even say that should would talk with her. Unfortunately I do not recommend them at all. I would rather die at home then go back. To top it off they delete the bad reviews off of Facebook.... Good going St. Joe's!

This is a review solely on making an appointment and my appointment time not being kept, NOT the actual service.   I called Stapley Monday evening and left a voice mail stating that I needed someone to come look at my garage and give me a quote on what I would need to get done to get my garage functioning again. The garage opener completely stopped working and it is a old unit so I assume I need quite a few things done but I know NOTHING about garages, hence needing someone to come look at it and give me a quote.  An appointment was made for today between 12 and 3pm. I let the lady know that I had class until 12:30 today so a note was made in my appointment stating so. It is now 3:30pm and there has been no form of communication from Stapley stating that the service guy would be late. I just called and explained that no one has shown up & asked if someone is on the way. The lady was very kind but didn't seem shocked by what I had said. She had me hold and contacted the service guy. She came back and said he was stuck on a job and wouldn't be to my place until after 4:30pm & asked if that was ok. I said no cause I have been waiting at home for the service guy since I got home from school. If someone would have called and communicated that they got caught up and we're running late I would totally understand and would have gotten my errands done earlier so I could be home later for the service guy. Hopefully they improve their communication with customers if they have any schedule changes. A simple call or text could help keep a potential customer instead of drive them away.

If you want to spend a lot of money for a minimal amount of food this is the place to go. My boyfriend and I decided to try something different and go to Firebirds.  Our server was great! He seemed like a newbe but he was very sincere and always checking up on us, which we loved. The bread is pretty amazing but I've gone to cheaper places that have had just as good bread.  Once our plates arrived the food was good but we didnt have very much food on our plates. I was very disappointed by the $$$ to amount of food we were getting. In addition to the food, it was VERY loud and I think a lot of it comes from the kitchen being right off of the dining room.  All in all we will not be returning and we recommend you spend your money at Abuelos across the street. (Chandler Mall)

Horrible Horrible Horrible!  Tonight I went to Benihana for the first time for my friend's birthday. We had a reservation for 8:00PM for 20 people. My friends and I arrived at 7:52PM and we let them know we were ready to be seated...since one person who was with our group was not there we had to wait to be seated...ok that's fine. So at about 8:20 the last person arrives and we ask to be seated. The hostess told us that we could not be seated since our reservation had to be given up. I asked why and she said cause our entire party wasn't here by 8:15. I couldn't believe that they didn't tell us about this rule!  We were given free appetizers and some free rolls for the incontinence (which makes me think they double booked our table). At 9:25 we were FINALLY seated!  I asked a hostess if she could bring me some soy sauce since I had ordered rolls at the bar and she said sure. 15 minutes later I still had not gotten my soy sauce so I got up and looked for it myself. I have been a hostess before and MANY MANY times I have accommodated guests by getting them little things that they need even if I was not their server. I finished my rolls and shortly after I was sick. Seriously horrible customer service, horrible food and I will NOT be returning and I highly suggest that no one else visit this Benihana!

Horrible. We won't be back & I can't believe we actually came back after last time! We went to Logan's tonight for some dinner. My fiancé had to order about 4 different drinks cause they were out of all 4 alcohols that he requested. I wanted a specific rum and they were out of that too!  Our waitress informed us that they have been out for a few days now.  Last time we were here we had an issue with getting our drinks. It took them 20 mins to get us our drinks. This place is just a ticking time bomb. I have no hopes for it being open for much longer.

I recently visited this Walmart location for the first time a couple of weeks ago and I will never be back ...actually I will never go to another Walmart again after what I witnessed. I was doing some shopping on a Saturday around 12pm-1pm. The store was fairly busy. I walked by the beauty department and over heard someone yelling at another person. I followed the voice and found where this voice was coming from. The beauty manager was YELLING and very inappropriately putting down a demo rep. I hid in an area where I could watch without being seen by the manager (I later found out this managers name was Claudia). She was yelling at the rep for having her vendor sticker on incorrectly. This manager told the rep lady where to put the vendor sticker, then changed her mind and made her change the spot again and again. Claudia even said something to the effect of "I know you think you're too good for this badge but that's just too bad!" Really?!?! who says this?!?! There was NO indication that this rep thought she was "too good" for a sticker. This rep followed everything that the manager said and without argument. This manager walked away and the rep began helping customers...even me. She had a smile on her face even though it looked like she was gonna cry. She showed me her coupons and explained the sale then gave me one. I then just started looking at other beauty products in the area and that was it. There was NO WAY the rep was harassing me. I then heard Claudia's piercing voice call the rep over and tell her that she was harassing customers. WHAT?!?! No Claudia, you are the one who is harassing people. I got close again and heard Claudia tell the rep that she now needed to stand in a different spot and get a table to stand behind. The rep explained that she was not instructed by her company to bring a table therefore she did not have one. She then let out a huge annoying sigh and brought over another associate. She then took off and he got right in her personal space in her face and said "She is the boss. I don't care what the request is! You are NOBODY and I couldn't care less about your "little coupons" because your company will just replace you with someone who listens!" Ummmm....what? He then walked away. I then walked up to her and said I was so sorry about what just happened. Was there someone I could call to help her? She said that she was fine and wished me a good day. I ran into another associate and asked for the beauty managers name. I then said "it seems that shes a rough manager, I feel bad for you guys. Shes treating the rep like shit." The guy said "Yes, she hates having reps here and will find any way to possibly get them kicked out. Its because they make way more money then she does." Well Claudia, if you want to make more money then go find another job that will pay more and that you enjoy instead of ripping people apart and being incredibly disrespectful.  I later called the store and CLAUDIA answered. I acted like I didn't know who she was and told her what happened. I figure hearing that a customer SAW this treatment would shift her a little. NOPE. Claudia basically called me a liar. She asked where in the store I was multiple times and said she was going to pull tapes and review them (which I know they wont). I told her a person like the manager should not have a management position because they obviously cannot handle ANYTHING. She said "well there was other issues with the vendor that you don't know about" I said that I didn't care but a person should never speak to another person that way and a WALMART MANAGER should NEVER EVER THINK of speaking to another human that way...ever. It is just unacceptable." She didn't say much and told me should would take care of it and rudely hung up on me.  Since I got no where with the store, I called corporate. They thought it would be a good idea to have a manager from that store call me back...well I don't agree. I already tried to speak with the store manager and obviously got no where. I am now waiting for someone from the regional office to call me. This is an issue that is unacceptable. I can not believe Walmart has such a horrible, heartless person working as management. I really hope that Walmart takes this issue seriously and makes adjustments with their staff.

Ocean Trail is an amazing place to dine out. Everything from the lighting to the food are spectacular!  Please don't get this confused with a sushi resturatunt because it is not a sushi place (nor was it ever supose to be, according to the server, I just think the name throws people off) Anyway I highly suggest people come and give this place a try!

I went to Curtis Orthodontics after a recommendation from a friend whom had hers done there.  I must say the office is SUPER clean! I was very impressed by this! The staff is very friendly and amazing all the way around! Even with an issue I have had with them they have been acting fully professional and very kind! My only issue with them is I do not feel like I was given any options to my orthodontic care and therefore we are going back and fourth about what to do. I got braces put on a month ago. Clear tops and metal bottoms. Everything was great but then during my last visit I realized (by looking on their screen) that I was charged an extra $800 for clear braces on the top! I told the dental assistant I was not given an option and I should have been given an option to have clear or metal, especially since it was a $800 difference! I told her I was very upset by this and not happy at all. She said that after my appt she would have me talk to their financial department. During this appointment I was also given the Propel treatment which is supposed to speed the process up. Today I was told it was an added charge of $500!!!!!! During my first visit I was told that this was going to happen, they never sat down to explain my choices to me on having the propel or not. I honestly just thought it was something that they just did cause no amount was ever told to me. Sooooo there is $1300 that was never discussed with me.  Today I was told that the clear braces were actually $300 not $800.... Either way I should have seen some sort of itemized documentation. I wasn't aware of these things costing more at all, I just thought it was all the same. Especially since when I saw the final price I asked the lady "is this the best that we can do?" I understand that things happen and sometimes there is miscommunication but I feel that I should not have to be punished for not being told how much individual things cost. There are a couple other issues as well so I am very much hoping that things can be made right.  If my experience changes I will for sure be changing the ratings on this but until then I will leave this at 2 stars.

Curtis Orthodontics has worked with me regarding this issue. Of course I can't give them 5/5 because of the huge communication issue. I am happy to say that Curtis Orthodontics went back and fourth with me to make sure we could come to a good compromise. That right there says a lot about a company and I greatly appreciate it.

I received a massage from Touch of Healing as a Xmas present. I decided to use it last week and I am glad that I didn't pay for it myself. My massage therapist Thomas had ice cold hands for about half of the massage. It was very hard to relax due to this. Also during the last half of my massage I heard a big thud on the door which startled me and someone pushing paper under the door. That took me out of the relaxed state that I just got into. I then heard my door open and the massage therapist pull keys out of his pocket and give them to someone. It was the most unrelaxed massage I have received.  :-(  UPDATE: I received an email from Thomas offering me a free 30 minute massage BUT I could upgrade to an hour for $25.... I don't think so. The email seemed pretty unprofessional and he added that him disrupting the massage was for the best. This email was a little creepy at parts and unprofessional to say the least.

WOW! What can I say? Nathan and Erica went above and beyond anything that we had ever expected for our wedding day. They were there for us during all of our wedding planning stages and kept in regular communication with us & our other vendors.  On our wedding day/night Nathan and Erica worked as an amazing team and helped in anyway possible. Since its so easy to lose track of time on your wedding day, Erica even kept us on time with our dances, toasts and cake cutting. This helped us out immensely! One thing to know before you book; they are not your typical "wedding DJ", they make the entire night flow perfectly and best of all, a night you and your guests will never forget! Our wedding guests had tons of complements throughout our wedding night and still two months later, our guests are talking about how awesome it was to have music videos playing on the projector as they danced the night away.  We seriously can't say enough fantastic things about them! If you are on edge about booking them, let me help you out by telling you "You need to hire this true dream team!"

Best coffee spot ever!!!!! I am in love with Dutch Bros!!!!! I went there after my co-worker kept talking to me about it. Let me say that before I was introduced to Dutch bros I was a Starbucks girl. VERY DEDICATED SBUX GIRL! My first visit there I placed my order... I forgot to say that I wanted coconut milk & I apologized and told them it was my first time at Dutch Bros. Right away every employee greeted me and I got a card full of stamps for my next visit.  Every visit since has been amazing! I love how quickly I get my coffee even if there are 10 cars ahead of me. I am also a huge fan of the small talk that the employees engage in with me while I am paying/getting my coffee. The owner of Dutch Bros has this business down perfectly!!!

Today was the first time I took my Mark 8 to be serviced anywhere since I inherited it from my late father. I wanted my car to be serviced by the best since the vehicle Is so sentimental to me. Anyway, I dropped the car off and told them to just get to it when they could because I wouldn't be able to pick it up until later anyway. I gave them my groupon for this visit and was aware that the car would need an extra quart (which wasnt covered with the Groupon) and with tax it was going to cost me $5 out of pocket. About an hour after I dropped my car off I got a call saying it was done. Wow! Now that's service!!! Since I was still running errands and at that point knew I wouldn't be able to get it until after-hours I asked that my keys be left in the car. I then asked then if I could pay with debit card over the phone. Surprisingly, I was told not to worry about the extra quart or taxes! What???? I was totally taken back that an AUTO SERVICE facility was NOT going to charge me for what I SHOULD HAVE paid for. They not only treated something very sentimental to me with complete respect and got the car serviced very quickly, they went above and beyond my expectations!!!! I will be going to Carlife for now on and recommend them to anyone that has any automotive needs!

What can I say about Sparks' Locksmith that hasn't already been said? We just purchased a new home and were prepairing to change the locks on the home soon...well on Chrismas Eve we found someone looking around our home just enough to make us feel uncomfortable. We called Sparks and he was out within 20 minutes! Not only was he fast, he was friendly AND I was able to take advantage of the student discount that was offered! One of our doors also had a broken piece and he replaced it for us without any charge. He was absolutely amazing and we now feel much safer in our new home. I would highly recommend using Sparks' Locksmith to anyone and will use him again!

I bought a groupon for lunchtime lift. The facility was very nice but the lady whom administered my Botox was distracted by something else. I bought 20 units cause I require 21 (I've had it done before). She did the Botox and threw a good amount of it that was in the syringe away. My fiancé so saw this happen... Now it's 10 days later and I still have the same lines ( some have decreased a little but not as much as they should ). She didn't even ask if I would like the rest on another part of my face or anything. It was like she was trying to hide that she was throwing some away. Hopefully this business does the right thing and offers me a refund or allows me to come back in to get this all corrected since my wedding is only a few weeks away!  I will update and change my star status if they fix this.

Hopefully this business does the right thing and offers me a refund or allows me to come back in to get this all corrected since my wedding is only a few weeks away!   UPDATED: I called and scheduled an appointment and then got a call back the next day saying there was an emergency and the nurse at the Chandler location needed to reschedule. MY WEDDING is in a couple of weeks mind you. The guy said he wasn't sure if they would be able to fix it without charging me and kinda argued with me about what happened so needless to say, I made an appointment with another place that I have had Botox done at before. I don't have the time to trust them and see if it happens. Horrible business and unfortunately I wasted $100 and my time.  Don't do what I did.... Go somewhere that has Botox that works and to someone who will use ALL the Botox needed and fix the situation if need be.  If they end up offering me a refund or having me come in AFTER my wedding for Botox (without charge) I will change my review.

I came to Fire Me Up to attend a local fundraiser. Sadly, my fiancés piece was broken (along with a couple of others). I was not offered a refund and we were actually charged more then we were supposed to be charged at the event. After SEVERAL months of letting the head of our fundraiser go back and fourth with Fire Me Up, I reached out myself to Fire Me Up via Facebook a couple of days ago regarding a refund. They read my message right away but still haven't responded. I know it's only $35 but it's the principal of it.  If I get a response and a refund then I will happily change my review but right now I would never recommend Fire Me Up to anyone.  UPDATE: I was able to receive my money back for our Fire Me Up broken pieces. I do appreciate it but it took almost a year to get the $35 back plus I had to make many phone calls.
