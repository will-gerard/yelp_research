Beautifully remodeled store! It's Saks, so obviously they have very upscale merchandise. They carry the best of the best designers...BUT-b/c Saks at the Biltmore is such a small store, they don't get a lot of the merchandise selection as their other locations. So, it's good to go online, and check out the selection prior to going to the store to see what is available. Also, be sure to speak to a salesperson to see if they can locate what you are looking for at one of their larger stores. For example, there was a Gucci handbag I was looking for...I know Saks was going to carry it, but it wasn't on display, simply b/c they do not have the physical space. So do your homework before you shop if you want something specific, and get the "most coveted" things at the beginning of the season, before they sell out! Also they have the best sunglasses dpt of any major dpt store!

This is a truly fantastic place to have drinks. The outdoor patio off the lobby has an atmosphere that's great for a group or a romantic date. I love going when it's chilly and getting warmed up by the fire pits and heated lamps. They often have live music and I LOVED the Gondola ride. The gondolier sings you a song and it is very cute...and certainly a different way to spend an evening. (Of course I was cracking up the whole time but it WAS fun)

Dr. Miller is awesome and talented. The hygenist, Lauren is great and the cleanings don't hurt! Lovely offices, great location, and they will work with you regarding payment.

Always a good flick to see, even an art film or two. Unfortunately, there are so many broken seats! So NOT comfortable. They need to refurbish seats and make it stadium seating in all the theaters within the whole structure. I like that they have light lemonade though. I much prefer the 101.

This is the deal...it's Neiman's so obviously they have very upscale merchandise. They carry the best of the best designers...BUT-b/c Scottsdale Fashion Square is such a small store, they don't get a lot of the merchandise selection as their other locations. So, it's good to go online, and check out the selection prior to going to the store to see what is available. Also, be sure to speak to a salesperson to see if they can locate what you are looking for at one of their larger stores. For example, there was a Gucci handbag I was looking for...I know Neimans was going to carry it, but it wasn't on display, simply b/c they do not have the physical space. So do your homework before you shop if you want something specific, and get the "most coveted" things at the beginning of the season, before they sell out! Their men's stuff is pretty lame...Saks is way better.

Wow. This place was great. I had a fantastic massage here and spent the rest of the day, working out and relaxing. The gym was really nice, clean and had lots of equipment, each piece w/ it's own TV. They somehow managed to make it very personal despite the zillion treatment rooms. They also have these delcious 'spa' cookies and different complimentary beverages so you can continue to indulge yourself after your treatments. The only spas I prefer to this were The Boulders and The Sanctuary.

I absolutely love this place. From the minute you walk in, you smell the aroma of the candles...which is like being on a tropical vacation. The fun drinks are sooo good. You feel like you're at the beach! I usually order off the lunch menu, even if I'm there for dinner. The atmosphere is awesome, and it's great to take a stroll around Kierland afterwards. I have never been disappointed here. Make sure you get a good seat...either on the patio or facing outside.

I love this place because I can eat healthfully. Steamed chicken and veggies...also it's nice they offer brown rice. The ambiance is nice and almost always get seated right away. The waitstaff is a bit inconsistent but overall, I come here for a healthy big plate of steamed food!

I like the ambiance of this place...it's pretty and trendy but not too loud. The food and service are really good. THE BEST DESSERT is the Bars of Sin. It is worth going to the restaurant, if just to eat that! PROMISE.

Thank goodness for this theater!  I love the smaller art house type films with small budgets...Pretty shocking that Scottsdale has this theater, and it's always crowded. The ladies restroom needs remodeling, but other than that, you can't beat a double feature on a hot Arizona day. Thank you Mr. Harkins for having the guts to believe there are people in Scottsdale that will support foreign films!

As far as spas in Arizona...this one is fabulous. Not just because of their amazing treatments but b/c it is so indigenous to the Southwestern culture. The landscape is just amazingly breathtaking. You will feel relaxed, pampered and serene.

Whenever I have a friend in from out of town I take them here. Visually the restaurant is really attractive and feels comfortable. The people watching is fun and it's near fantastic shopping. Anything I've ever ordered here has been really great.  The 'cafe' in the front is good too, if you're in a hurry...even for breakfast.

This has got to be the LEAST appetizing name for an Italian restaurant. It's called "The Firm." Can't they make it  La Firma for instance?? The decor is a bit outdated as well. BUT the food was amazing! I was very surprised due to the lame decor...The waitstaff was friendly and the portions were big. Personally, I think it's more of a dinner place b/c it's kind of dark .. and the meals are heavy. Yummy pasta!

This spa was fantastic. The service attendants are helpful, there are great treatments and technicians. It is luxurious, beautiful and you will feel totally pampered. Make sure to have lunch in their rooftop restaurant as well. The food is great, and the views are spectacular. The gym was nice and the pool was lovely too..and very clean. One of the top spas in Scottsdale for sure!

This spa was so hard to find. There is no good signage on the property to get you there. In hindsight, that may have been a good thing! The place is pretty much, a dump! Very outdated, and I swear it smelled. I have no idea why this hotel is known to be so upscale. As far as the spa goes, I was seriously disappointed and would never go back. There are so many beautiful spas in Scottsdale...avoid this one. Yuck!

What do you expect? it's Michael Mina...This place is a fortune, but well worth it. It's not someplace you'd come to on a regular basis, I'd say it's more of an 'occasion' restaurant. The dishes are pretty much culinary masterpieces and the service is top notch. Even the 'bread' they put on the table is this rosemary baked potato truffle concoction. I can't tell you how disgusting you will feel after eating at this place, you will be so full! I could not believe that I was eating the most spectacular french fries (they give you a trio of flavors"...the secret ingredient? duckfat. uchhhhhhhhh. but sooo good. Definitely a heavy meal...be in the mood to chow on fine food. You will not want to eat the next day!

As a NY'er...I can tell you this pizza isn't THAT good...and it's inconsistent. I like Ray's far better.

Great staff and well fitting workout gear at affordable prices :) They really should open stores in all major cities across the US. Their bottoms fit better than their neighbor at Scottsdale Quarter (lululemon).
