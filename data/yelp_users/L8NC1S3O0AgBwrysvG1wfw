I hadnt been there in years, and it was all I remembered.  I went with a coupon that I go purchased on the Living social website.  Champagne toast, appertizer, salad and all you can eat entree.  They also do a complimentary photo for you.  Very quaint and romantic.  But the food was fantastic.  We had the cheese fondue that was just delicous.  The meat course was also wonderful.  But the thing that really made our experience great, was waiter.  He was great, and funny and he was there when you needed him.  But I do not suggest turning up there without a reservation.  You can make reservations online, very quick and easy and you get a confirmation.

I went to see Dr Richardson URGENTLY a few weeks ago.  They had me in after my phone call within 30 minutes.  I had severe pain in my lower jaw, a xray was done and it was determined I had an Abcess.  Dr Richardson was trying to explain to me what was going on but because of the Pain in my head, I couldnt think.   He fixed that very quickly with 2 shots of Novacain.  Now I could think about what he was telling me.  So we made an appointment for the following week as I was already taking antibiotics, and we would get this taken care of.  Over night the Pain was so bad, that I called the next day and Dr Richardson called another perscription straight away, and told me to call ANYTIME over the weekend.  That was some great reassurance that there was someone to call.  He explained everything, made sure I was numb before the procedure was started.  I am never a great lover of going to the Dentist, but I am so glad I went to see him.  I have to have some other work done and I will be going back to him for sure.  Everyone there is great also.

I really like this place alot the food is good, BUT, we got a delivery and it took 2 + hours. REALLY.  I dont care how busy you are, first rule, you never say I am soooo busy, everyone is busy.  I dont know that we will ever order from there again, if it is going to take that long to deliver food.

I have been here before, its a bar!  But last night my husband our friends decided to go here have some drinks and a bite to ear.  Our Waitress was NEW! We ordered our drinks and the place wasnt overly full at 9pm.  20 minutes later, our drinks arrived.  We ordered our food.  Nothing special, me Garlic Fries, my husband a small taco salad, our friends a Calzone.  Food was coming out of the kitchen, and I saw my fries at the pass, my husbands Taco Salad also there.  And that is also where they sat for another 40 minutes, until the Calzone was ready. In all it took 75 minutes to get our food.  Needless to say I didnt eat the STONE COLD Garlic Fries.  Also when it came time to get another drink, our waitress was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND.  We had to go to the bar to get out drinks, only to be told, we had to go back to our table and for our waitress to take our order again, that would be fine if we could fnd her.  We decided to move from the Bar area, to the Karaoke side.  Our waitress informed us we would have close our tab, and didnt serve that side.  At that point, that was fine with me.    The waitress had too many stations for someone who was new to handle.  There was a big party there, and they were taking all her time, so she should have given our table to someone else.   Ive been there before, and it wasnt like that at all, but if this is what its like from now on, I wont be going back again.

Went to this place with my husband for the first time yesterday. It was recommended to us by a friend.  I had seen this hidden treasure before, but never been in to the store.  Food was great, and the portion sizes were GREAT.  Prices were good for Happy hour prices, staff was very friendly, and if you need something changed, the staff were only too happy to accomodate this.  There was no Childrens menu, but when asked, the staff said they would be happy to make smaller portions for children.  All in all, we will be going back again.

Im in Las Vegas for a few days and my husband and I decided to go somewhere for Breakfast.  Found this place near downtown. I had the corn beef hash which was quite good but the potatoes that came with it, were like having Home made potato chips, which is not exactly what I was looking to have for breakfast.  The place was very nice, very clean a little hard to find, if you missed the sign, you would miss it.  Not sure if we are in town again that we would go back.

My husband and I had a gift certificate for $25, so we had the 2 for $25.  The place was packed out, but we ate at the bar, it was open, and it was great.  The gal there was very friendly, I had a lovely Moscato sangria.  We had totally enjoyed out meal, had the brushetta and calamari, yummy, and then I had Eggplant Parmagino and my husband like a seafood stew.  So much food, we had to take it home.  Well worth a trip for a taste of Italy.

My husband and his Buddy played golf here today. They just over seeded, they should have informed them before they played. According to my husband they had just over seeded and it was like putting on Shag Carpet.  Also the Golf Carts were VERY Loud.  He wont be going back there any time soon!

I contacted this company after another company failed to show up.  They sent out someone to see what we had going on.  Unlike the other company they wanted to BOMB our house and we had to be out for 3 hours, they put down baits, insecticides that are PET friendly and didnt sell us anything that we didnt need.  They told us what they were doing, why and what other things they thought we had lurking with the evidence that was around the house.  They were on time, and very, very nice.  I highly recommend them.

If this is fish and chips, then I'm a monkeys uncle!  They served some sort of RED sauce that i think had horseradish in it for your dipping sauce for the fish!  What the hell is that.  Fish and Chips get served with either Lemon and Tartare Sauce and  Malt Vinegar for your Chips.  Wont be going back there EVER!!!!

The staff are very friendly, very nice, very attentative.  The game was on, and the folks that go there are very passionate about the football, so it made it fun to watch the game.  The food was very good, and game out, very quickly.  This would be my choice of places to go on Mill Ave.

The only person to see in the Garden department is Annette, she knows the valley, and what is good to grow in the valley. She has never steered me in the wrong direction in the past 5 years of going there.  The Phoenix area is different for growing season and plants, unlike other parts of the country.

Love this grocery store, they have great parking right at the door.  I go to get a sandwich at lunch time, its quick in and quick out.  The Sandwich lady sometimes needs an attitude adjustment, but for the most part everyone is very friendly, and offer alternatives to just your regular old sandwich.

I go there most Friday nights with my husband.  We always sit at the bar.  Everyone is very friendly, and you never have to wait very long for your food or for drinks.  We take people when they come in for out of town, and they cannot believe how friendly all the waiters and bar staff are.  The downside, sometimes the welcome staff are not that friendly.

I havent been here for a year and half, they use to have great buffalo wings, and now ehhhh.  We use to frequent this place every week until they changed there buffalo wings recipe and they are now breaded, not naked.  Met friends down there last night for drinks, but you would hardly know its a Sports bar, because the Music was so loud last night I couldnt hear the person next to me when they were talking! Dont think we will be going back again anytime soon, unless they change things, so back to Applebees we go.

Went here the other day for the first time.  It was really good, and Im looking forward to going back again and trying other things.   I had the Meat and Cheese pastie with the Red Wine Gravy.  ummm YUM!  I also had a side of baked beans.  Probably the closest thing I have had to and Australian Meat Pie in years.  I am really looking forward to going back and trying sheppards pie, made with minced LAMB.  You can get to go orders as well.

Totally dissapointed.  I had purchased a coupon from TravelZoo, to try out this restaurant, which given its location I would have thought it was going to be very upscale and we were expecting a WHOLE LOT MORE.   The Service was great, but the food, not worth it.  The restaurant itself is very outdated, very 80's.   My husband and I had the crab cakes for appertizer.  They were cold when they were served.  We told our waiter, who in turn told the chef, and the message was passed back to us, that she appologized.    My Husband ordred a 12oz New York Strip ala carte for $29.95, 6 oz of that was pure fat!  and for the price you would expect to get more meat than fat!  I ordered a wild mushroom pizza, which was OK.   This place needs an over haul in a major way, if they want to make any money at the restaurant, which for a Saturday night at 7pm when we went, was empty.  I think the highlight of the meal was the bottle of cabinet!

My husband and I went her today for the first time, and we were NOT disappointed.  The food was great, our waitress recommended the Onion Rings, they were delicious.  My husband had the Bleu Cheese burger and he said "texture wise it was soft and succulent"  I had the fish tacos that were just Yummy.  We sat right by the water, and it was just a perfect afternoon.  I am in Laveen and it was a very easy 1 hour drive from our house to Scorpion Bay.  We cant wait to go back here and take our Canadian Family when they come at Christmas Time!

I got a gift certificate here for my birthday.  I went this morning and got a pedicure.  I had made an appointment given it is Saturday.  I had a man, and told him to please be gentle and that I was very ticklish on my feet.  He was very good.  I got a scrub as well on my legs and a really nice LIGHT massage on my legs, which is good as I dont like when people are too forceful.  I think I will be going back here.   just dont know the guys name who did my tootsie, but I will be wanting him back next time!

My PCP recommended Valarie Sorkin-Wells as I was having some problems and my OBGYN couldn't get me in for 5 months!  She was so nice, and spoke to me like a real person, and listened to what was going on.  But she also made me feel like I was incontrol by giving me options.  I had to have some testing done, that was done in house.   I had to have surgery, and my husband was impressed with Dr Sorkin-Wells also, she is just so personable.  While I was getting ready to go under general anesthetic she stood by myside the whole time.  I cannot say enough of how wonderful that made me feel.  I am recommending her to all my friends.  The OBGYN is usually the last place most women want to go, but this one makes you feel so comfortable.

I love this place, its had a 1950's feel to it, but the food is fantastic.  I always go for the Monte Christo Sandwich, its the Saturday special, but you can get it any time, if you ask for it.  The portion sizes are very good.  They have different daily specials every day.  And if you work around the area, you can call your order and pick it up.  I took my husband for his birthday yesterday for the first time, hes a fan now too, and I am sure we will be going back there again soon.

my husband called to get our garage door repaired, it needed a new spring.  The guy called early he had a cancellation.  GREAT thought this was looking promising.  He looks at my garage door "oh we dont service those kind of garage doors"  oh ok.  But then he proceeds to say but we could probably get the part for you, it will take about 4 weeks!  OK not exactly the answer I wanted but OK I could wait for weeks.  Then he proceeds to tell me he has a spring at his house that would fit on my door. I said OK, it would be a different brand than I had now.  I asked how much would this NEW system be.  Oh its only $900.  Really $900 to repair my door.  Ummm no thanks I called you to fix my door not sell me a new system.  I gave him his $45 service fee and sent on his way.  Meanwhile I have Wayne Dalton coming to fix my for $285.

Well where to start!.  We came to watch some of the Sunday's Games.  We sat down, no one recognized that we had even come into the bar until we called the girl, over to see if we could order some food and drinks.  That took about 10 minutes.  We ordered a round of drinks, while we were deciding what to order.  My husband and his buddy ordered a pitcher or beer, I ordered a Sangria, and my friend ordered something.  The gal came back with the beer, and 4 glasses, even though I ordered a sangria.  As she was pulling the glasses apart, one broke.  and there was a big chunk of glass that feel under my foot.  She took the broken glass away, and I thought she was coming back to clean up the rest, but NO.  I picked up the big chunk that was on the floor, and when she came back I had to tell her to bring a broom with her to clean up the shards of glass that were left on the floor!  My Sangria came, it had 8 Marachino Cherries in it, 1 lemon 1/2 a lime. I didnt realize I had ordered Fruit Salad.  My friend ordered something that tasted like Robatusin!.  Gross.  The bartender also made an extra drink that they didnt know what to do with, so they just gave it to us!.  We ordered the Football Hamburger Special.  $5.00.  The Hamburger was mediocre at best!.  And I got 10 steak fries!  My friend, got 6!  Wow!  I dont know if the waitress is to blame for just being young and inexperienced, or if it is Blondies fault for not training her properly.  And the Bartender, well dont know what to say.  Other than, we wont be going back there any time soon!

I went here with friends last night.  I read the reviews and knew I had to have the fried mozzarella which is home made every day and stuffed mushrooms with spinach dip, and I was not dissapointed at all.  They were delicious!  The pizza was amazing also. Everthing is Family style.   They have a full bar, and a wonderful menu of wines, and they also have some that are not on the list.  Would have loved to go and sit on the patio, but the Haboob had other ideas last night!  But definitely somewhere I will go back again to again.

Great Value, Great Food.  I had the Burnt pieces, they were DELICIOUS, but they wont be for everyone.  Got a Beef Brisket Sandwich.  You can put your own BBQ sauce on, so I did half BBQ and half Caroline Sauce.  Mmmmm both were very good.  There is also the HOT option.  I hope they get some other drinks in there, not a Beer fan, would have loved a Smirnoff Ice or a Mikes Hard Lemonade, maybe next time.  They are open for Lunch and Dinner, and you can call your order in for lunch and then go pick up.

I called to make an appointment for my husband today.  First of all when I call the line was busy!  I called back 15 minutes later, to be put on hold!  Once I got to speak to the scheduler, I wanted to make an appointment for a established patient.  Because of my husbands work schedule they couldn't get him in until July 11.  Oh but wait, because Dr Cardenas has left, he had to have an appointment with another Dr. So it is considered a NEW patient appointment to establish with the new Dr.  So cant have that appointment until July 18.  Mean while there are prescriptions that need to be filled, and they cannot be filled until July 18.  Lets hope my husband doesn't DIE while waiting to get these prescription refilled. SOLUTION: Dump Westline Family Medical Center, and do somewhere where firstly the receptionist DOESNT SUX WITH ATTITUDE, and go somewhere you can be seen timely.  We are changing Dr's already got an appointment set up with Dr. Cippola down the road!!

I have been going here now for about 6 weeks, trying to deal with some pain in my shoulder.  But they have started with saying we will get to the route of this problem, and we will go about it one step at a time, if one thing doesnt work we will try something else!  Yeah.  They have an Nurse Prac on staff, they have a Physical Therapist, you can get chriopractic if needed.  There can do X-Rays, Ultra Sound, take blood work, alergy testing, its really like one stop shopping.  I love Sim, shes the nurse prac I see, Carlos is my Physical Therapist, or as I like to call him, my physical Torturist!:)  These guys are Great, the whole practist is wonderful

I've been here quite a few times now I've had the Casbah Pizza which is absolutely delicious. The mass is also very very good. Tonight I tried a different pizza with lots of wild mushrooms and veggies very very good. My husband tried the barbecue chicken pizza which was also very very good. I haven't had anything yet that is not absolutely wonderful and delicious

Well I have been going to Leslies for 7 years, and I am done with them!  I needed to get my pool filters cleaned and last time I was at Leslies I was SCOLDED, because I hadn't had them done with in 6 months.  So I went to Sea Turtle.  Booked my appointment, told them what I needed.  Firstly Sea Turtle is CHEAPER for getting your filters cleaned, buy $30, bye bye Leslies.  They offer you cheaper alternatives to doing things.  And when the young man came to do my filters, he had the wrong ones with him, Don't worry Maam I will be back with the right ones.  Yes he was and he also brought some treats for my dogs.  They all knew what they were talking about and didn't treat me like an Idiot, like Leslies has done on many occasion.  Every one do yourselves a favor, and go see Kathy and her staff, they treat you like a real person.

Wayne does a fantastic Job, always on time, my carpets are beautiful when he leaves as is my grout that he scrubs back to the way it looked the day it was being put in.  He is always ON TIME, and his rates are fantastic,  He is the best I have ever used.  Give this company a try.  He is also owner/operator so it is always important to support local businesses.

I've been to another vet in Laveen that I shall not go back to again.  Dr Ware got down on my dogs level as he was nervous. He gave him so love and he started to warm up to him. We will be going back with our other 2 pugs. They are also very reasonably priced
