Two words: bug infestation.   Prior to tonight I would have given this restaurant at least 4 stars because I have been to this location through their drive through a couple times and they got my order right, were very friendly, and the prices were always good because I receive coupons in the mail. After tonight though, I'll probably never return.   My husband (this review is being written by Stephen's wife, Celeste, by the way) and I decided to take our two kids with us for an inexpensive family meal out, especially because we had received more great El Pollo coupons. Well we had never eaten inside the store and didn't realize we would be sharing our dining experience with hundreds of small and unwelcome guests. They were literally everywhere and even though I wiped off the table and chairs before we sat down my husband still had one get on him. He was so grossed out that he couldn't finish his meal (and he's not usually very squirmy about bugs).  All my 2 yr old son could keep saying during the meal was "bug! bug!" as he pointed at the floor or tables.   The service was still very friendly, but our bag of chips was very stale (they did replace them when I mentioned it though), and the place was generally filthy. I really hope that their food prep area is a lot cleaner than their guest dining area, because if the dining area is any indication of the kitchen I'll be very surprised if we didn't ingest a few bugs. It's too bad because I think If they would just keep it clean they would get a lot more service (certainly we would be return customers if it were cleaner, but will not be now).

Just tried this place out today for the first time- I may have found my new coffee home. :)  I like Starbucks but I've always been a fan of supporting the smaller guys (althought this is a chain, I'm not sure how big they are nationally).  Coffee Rush (in Gilbert and Chandler) has been my mainstay for years but its getting crowded and the hipster and high school crowds are really starting to wear on me.  I'm in my late 20's but I prefer a place that has less edge and focuses on an enjoyable experience. That's this place. The locals crowd appears to skew a smidge older - late 20's - 50's and the atmosphere is perfect for getting work done.  Music selection is awesome. Every tune that has been playing in here has been a treat. Normally I put a headset on right away and listen to my own stuff, but the headphones have been chilling on the table the entire time because the music is THAT good. Great selection- from old school swing to more obscure favorites like Massive Attack.  Service was good. The barista was sweet and brought the coffee to my table- an extra nice touch over starbucks 'pick it up at the counter' approach.  Wasn't too crowded- enough people here to feel homey but not stuffy.  Wifi was fast and speedy for me. I had dropbox running while here which pulled down some decent size files with no problem (I normally turn this off so as to not suck up bandwidth, but I wanted to test it and see how their speeds were today).  Coffee is excellent from what I can tell- mixed cold drinks are delicious. A bit expensive but delicious.  Will return for sure- nice job guys!

Really enjoyed a wonderful evening here. My husband and I were looking for a new, romantic, chill place to try and this restaurant fully delivered.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful (with a delightful French accent), we took her recommendations and split the goat cheese salad and the filet mignon and they were both very satisfying.  The bread that came with the salad, combined with the warm goat cheese and lemon-honey sauce, was very delicious.  The steak was very tender & cooked perfectly, however I found the flavor to be slightly less bold than I'm used to in filet mignon.  It was still very edible though, and came with delicious fries and a warm, bread-crumb encrusted tomato.  My husband enjoyed their Chilean Pinot Noir, I decided to pass on the wine  (mostly out of budget consideration, not for lack of selection).  We also very much enjoyed the live music which was a female vocalist with a beautiful voice who seemed to mostly be doing covers but was very talented (& it was not too loud or distracting but fit the atmosphere perfectly).  This has definitely made one of our new favorites!
