Had dinner before a movie, we walked in and it was pretty dead except for a few Jedis and pikachus, and marios bros (comicon weekend). We sat down and ordered our drinks the waitress was very kind and suggested a higher quality margarita for my sister since they didn't have patron... But seriously what kinda Mexican restaurant does not have Patron... Anyhoo, I ordered a Tecate and asked for a glass with Tajin (Mexican Chili lime powder) and they again told me they didn't have this.. Again I was shocked....This is something Mexican restaurants should have in stock at all times. Instead I got Dos Equis... We ordered or food and I swear they must have had these plates ready because they came out within 5 min... I got machaca chimichangas, my sister got Enchiladas... As expected it was pretty good... Decent I would say, but my mom makes them better. lol. The beans were good, but rice of course was boxed uncle bens rice.. I mean c'mon... Why even open a Mexican restaurant if your just going to not really offer real Mexican food. Overall I gave it a sideways thumb... If I was hungry and everywhere was closed I would come back, but if there was other options I would take those.

Came here with my sister last night before a screening of a movie to get some drinks. It was pretty slammed because NBA finals were on but we found 2 seats at the bar no problem. I got my ole faithful COORS LIGHT!!! She got Patron Margarita! The bartenders were slammed but were great at checking up on us and making sure we were ok. On our refills another bartender made my sisters drink and when my sister tasted it right away she knew it was not patron. The Original bartender quickly fixed the problem and made her a fresh one. It was great customer service, except for the wrong drink being made... All she had to do is read the ticket... It was my sisters birthday and they were more then happy to help me embarrass her! They had her dance on a bar stood and flap her wings. It was fantastic. Overall good night. Definitely go back again.

Spent a Saturday night here and glad we did. There was a awesome live band, and it wasn't slammed. The waitress was fast and extremely friendly. You can consider this a dive bar but I think its a step above. They had pool tables and the giant Jenga. Will def. make a return here.

Best Chinese food ever!!! I have been ordering from this place for the last 8 yrs. My favorite is the sesame chicken combo! I know the last few orders delivery has been within 30 min which is outstanding because before then they say 45 min, but expect a hour. Its well worth waiting a hour so plan ahead. I love the little lady that answers"Gowden Eggwoll, how can I hewp you"!!! When you hear that your gonna get some bomb Chinese food.

So this place is kind of awkward.. We walked in and there was a guest at his table pretty faded playing his guitar. He wasn't a employee, just someone having lunch and hanging out. There is no host podium, or anyone to tell you what to do so for about 5 min we awkwardly stood near the door. They finally told us to just sit anywhere. We ordered our drinks and my soda came in a can. So gotta buy each one separately. The set up was very awkward, no ambience. The waitress is no where to be found after she takes your order. They finally brought our food which was decent for a dive (Most Mexican dive places have the best). I sat without a drink until I walked over to the waitress who was chit chatting with a couple other girls and asked for another. Mexican food places out here in mesa are a dime a dozen, so I would have thought they would try to up their game. Unfortunately it was a fail, aside from the food being decent, the waiting and awkward kind of dirty feel to the place was too much.

Walked in with a buddy on a Friday nigh after 8 yrs of not walking in here and was surprised. Im used to the rowdy fight, and tough atmosphere... This place has changed. We hung out for a while and had a few beers. The band was phenomenal, and the bartenders were super fast, we just felt super out of place because this place was loaded with people in their 50's and 60's.... Which isn't a bad thing, but just not our scene. At one point my buddy was talking to the only young lady at the cantina and had asked her to dance. There was a problem with this because the old folks had taken up the whole dance floor and formed a circle... They were each taking their turn doing their best 1960 dance move... It was pretty funny to watch, but it got old quick. Maybe id come back and hang for a beer and music if im bored. The music was the best thing about this bar. If they can figure out how to market to the younger crowd this place can be a hit... Again....

My wife and I got our first puppy from a rescue. We went to the vca which I was not fully content with. I found Brown Road Animal Clinic and I gotta say my pup found his forever vet. Dr. Mcnulty helped ke the first couple times and I really enjoyed how much she seemed to really care about my dog. She was ok with my million questions and was great with the information she provided. Today I saw Dr. Zinn, I didnt know what to expect out of a young guy but he seemed to be knowledgeable and care about my dog just as much. The staff there is always so friendly. I would advise anyone looking for a vet to try out this place.

I have used them several times. He works alongside his other shop in the old firehouse on power and University. I read that the customer service is bad, however I have gotten nothing but great service from him James. He is a old school tailor so he does have a tendency of going of subject but that alone shouldn't deter you from using someone with his experience in tailoring. This guy and his staff has altered several of my shirts. They are usually super fast about it also, and reasonably priced. I would def recommend him to anyone.

I came to this location to get my vision done and get some glasses. The test went well, the reason I am rating a 1 is because of the experience afterwards. The sales people are only interested in one thing.... SALES... I picked out a Oakley frame from a book since it wasn't in stock and was told it would fit perfectly. When they came in they were huge!!! they were Oakley XL. I told the sales rep they were sliding off my face he took them to the back and melted the sides 4 different times. These were the wrong ones for my face. He didn't care. I complained to the manager and was told that that's how these glasses are. So she dismissed the whole situation. This happened awhile ago and everytime I wear have to wear these huge glasses instead of my contact it still pisses me off. I spent 450 dollars on glasses they said would fit and don't. Id watch your pocketbook here. Definitely interested in your cash.

I have been coming to Vito's since I was like 10 yrs old. I used to do yard work for a neighbor and I wouldn't even care about the end of day pay, I would always be looking forward to lunch because he would always take us to Vito's. Well, I always remembered how much of a treat this pizza was and it always reminds me of those spring and fall days, taking lunch after doing yard work. This has some of the Best Pizza I've had here in AZ. I'm a native so trust me, ive tried other places. We get the thin crust and ask for it well done since recently learning "well done" means they keep it in the oven for a couple min longer and the crust gets crispier. This last weekend I wasn't in the mood for pizza, and tried the Chicken stuffed sausage and I am carb cycling so they were really friendly and accommodating in switching the risotto to Asparagus. The chicken was freaking amazing!!! I talked about it till the next day to my wife. I usually don't venture out into trying new things but man, it was phenomenal and glad I did. The Buffalo chicken pizza is another I would recommend, since it a favorite of mine. I have had other dishes and have never been let down by the quality of the food. Partys of 6 can call to make reservations, but if your going with a date or just a few people its best to get there early. Its no secret that this place gets super busy fast and we've waited up to a hour before. It is well worth it. This is a true Gem in Mesa.

I always get amazing food here. Never fails, the wait is usually kinda long maybe like 45 min. but its a good thing because thats how popular they are in our are. Their service is amazing and so are the breadsticks. We actually had them cater our wedding. They are the best in the area.

We volunteered here with my wife's company and it was amazing. We worked in the store and I gotta say, I was impressed at how nice the thrift store was and how nice and how many items they had. We took a tour of the property and learned so much about it. I am born and raised here and Mesa, my parents told me how much sunshine acres helped them when they came here to AZ from Mexico, and I never realized how much good they do till walking the property. It was hard not to tear up, not because your sad, but because your so happy to know these people are doing so much good for younger generations that without them would be stuck with disadvantages their whole life. I will be going back to volunteer on a regular basis to volunteer. Its amazing the love you feel when being there. If your going to shop youll love it, if your going there to volunteer youll soon know the feeling I am talking about.

The talent has always been great! Aside from the talent the service is pretty bad. They give you a 2 drink minimum which is cool, except the only option if your a beer drinker is budweiser products which leads me to believe they sold out... also 6 bucks for a bud light is a little extreme... we had a good time went thru a bucket of crappy budlight... we got food which was pretty bad for 14 bucks. They didn't even ask how I wanted my burger so by default I got "overcooked"... no hot sauce cause they don't believe in it and waiter looked annoyed I asked for condiments. 1 thing that got me fired up above all was I got my tab and gave them my debit card. When the card came back I was going to tip and add the total... my brother pointed out that without my permission they added a automatic tip, didn't tell me, then left the tip line open to tip more. So if your not paying attention your probably over tipping. This is significantly shiesty and borderline fraudulent charge. I erased the automatic tip and only authorized original price of my food and drinks and was still charged for the automatic tip even though I didn't authorize this... Fun time, but bring the vasoline because they are gonna take it to you without telling you. I will email them and update what happened.

I am in awe at how delicious this place was! Came here for our 5 yr anniversary and it was phenomenal! Fernando the manager was super kind and accomadating, and the host miss Sammons was the best!!! We ordered some drinks wife got wine, I got be my honey since it's Jack Daniels Tennessee honey, and it was delicious! I mostly drunk beer and this is my first drink out of a martini glass, and I didn't care because of how delicious it was. We were brought bread before dinner, and miss Sammons  was extremely professional and amazing at explaining the process of everything. She made us spinning salads tableside, then came the prime rib! My wife got a lobster tail also that she was raving about. The prime rib is also cut table side with mashed potatoes and I added creamed corn and omg glad I did. My mouth was having organisms because of the amazing flavors of everything!!! Then they hit you with some bread for dipping into au jus. Lastly they brought us a amazing key lime bunt cake that was perfectly sweet and soft. I wanted to buy another to take home it was so good! There is not enough good things to say about this restaurant and it's staff!!! Thank you nandoand miss Sammons for making our 5 yr anniversary dinner so memorable.

Not very impressed at all. We got our tickets from a diamond member for dirt cheap, and was stoked about seeing the show. Only to feel let down... honestly if your hear a short time in Vegas don't waste your time with this show. It was extremely boring, parts were super drawn out,  and there were only a couple parts that really entertained. I wanted to leave but I didn't since the money was already spent, and we were already a hour in. For all the advertisement, the hype this show fell flat on its face.

I'm not a huge hiker whatsoever, but today we used to take on echo canyon since i am into fitness. If you are completely out of shape I wouldn't suggest it, or just take your time. We saw a few supermans out there that got buckwild and we saw them 15 min later throwing their brains out... Lol. It starts out in a moderate up and down, there are a couple placed where they have put in rails to help you not eat it, after that it's petty much climbing over rocks and boulders. The view was Well worth it. It was fun, super challenging and it a adventure! I'm wore out and sore like no other, but I'd say so it again.

Took a walk to this nice little restaurant. I was surprised at how nice and clean this place was. It was very nice. I got the omlete George with turkey and was surprised how delicious it was. My wife had Belgian waffle, aside from the pretty slow service breakfast was delicious.

Been going to Dr. Adair for awhile on and off. I am big into powerlifting, my daughter is big into ballet and dancing so we frequent the chiropractor quiet often. Dr. Adair is patient and looks into the real problem and how it can be fixed quickly so we can go back to living our lives without pain. They perform laser therapy along with adjustments. I was a big skeptic on laser treatment but have to say I am impressed at how well it works. I would recommend him to anyone needing any kind of pain relief. He doesn't push pain meds nor Xrays like most chiropractors. Also they are very flexible and if you need a apt asap they will make it happen.

Anytime I want a delicious breakfast out in the morning I think of Crackers & Co. I have been coming here for several years and cant get enough of it. I mad another trip here this weekend and got in rather quick, usually there about a 30 min wait. Like always I got great fast service. I usually get the chicken fried steak with gravy but I didn't feel like eating something that heavy. Instead I got the chorizo skillet and I was blown away. Im usually the guy that orders the same thing since in know how its gonna taste and its safe. Im glad I tried this. It became my new favorite. Chorizo was a tad spicy which I absolutely love. That skillet didn't have a chance. 1 thing I can say I was disappointed in was the ratio to chorizo to potato... The potato was the filler but shouldn't be 80% potato and 20% chorizo.. Ill still be back to order again...

Came here to see a screening. This place needs a deep cleaning... It looks like no one cares about it anymore. You walk in and it looks pretty clean, you have to stand in 1 long ass line to get concessions, and its like a bank teller, they call you up 1 at a time. Bathrooms are extremely nasty. The grime in the grout is disgusting. We got into the theater and the movie was amazing, but I have never been so uncomfortable sitting in a theater chair.. Imagine this: You let your grandma borrow your car, she gets in and takes 25 min fixing the seat to hit her...butt back, chest forward...Now freeze that seat... reproduce thousands of them... now put them in this theater.. My back was killing by the time we walked out of there. The seats do not recline or move at all. They are stuck and your body has to conform to that! If it wasn't for this special screening I would have left and not looked back. Too much competition when it comes to theaters to not update and clean this badboy.

Lucky lou's is a tucked away bar and grill. They have pretty good food there and drinks. I'm a big Coors light guy and they didnt have that on tap, also there is no jukebox. those were the 2 downfalls i had. Other then that its a nice place to hang and have some brewjas, we used to go there after shooting. Nice relaxing place. I've never had like a meal there. I've always gotten something small. like quesadilla, or something like that. Pretty good appetizers.. Overall pretty good.

I used to come here 5 yrs ago all the time and they did great jobs. So I bought these groupon deals and I come here. The front ticket guy tries to uprade me to leather wipes. I decline. And with a smart ass tone said "only guy today that doesnt want it. Guess you'll be sliding around". I do sales for a living and being a ass is no way to upsell a customer. Then I asked him for new car smell. He then told me "wow, you come in with a groupon ticket and you expect car scent too"? I gotta say this place has gone down the drain. This is no way to talk to a customer.  Gotta say ill be heading back to full circle after my groupons are used.

Hit this spot up after hearing so many good things about it and it didn't disappoint. We stopped by on the way to a event late on sunday night around 730. We got right in no wait and the waiter was super fast and courteous. We ordered a beer and some rib tip tacos. Honestly I was expecting some crappy unflavored meat in a tortilla but what I got was delicious. The flavor of the meat and the flavor of the toppings mixed well. My only complaint was 12 bucks for 2 tacos is pretty damn steep. Other then this it was a nice place to get good food for a quick bite.

We've been to cheesecake factory a few times. This was by far my favorite one. We had server jennifer p. She was fast and funny and was great with my sense of humor. We ordered the potsicker s and they were phonomenal, these are by far the best I have had anywhere. It was a cheat weekend for me to I splurged on the Mac and cheese burger. I asked the waitress of I would regret eating this, and she said the aftermath would be to totally worth it. Food came out pretty slow, seemed like it took about 45 minutes. Jennifer did a great job of checking in on us and refilling our drinks in the meantime. We were told they had a couple of in training cooks so that was why it was going so slow. We finally got our food and it was amazing! I haven't haven't had a burger in a little over 2 months that I could have toppings on it and this was the best way to have a cheat weekend.  Although, the aftermath and regret only took 5 min to hit my belly. The burger used my intestines as a water slide! Great burger but be willing to use public restrooms!

I love Nandos food! They are delicious. If you like hot hot hot salsa ask them for the salsa from the back.. Ohh its hot and tasty. I've had a lot here and love all the dishes. We usually end up with the same waitress which was crazy but great because she is fast with refills and food. We usually come for dinner.

Went here a couple weeks back and have to say one of the best places I have found for Mexican food. Corn tortillas were homemade and delicious. The chicken tacos were my favorite. I rated a 4 star because they were short staffed and I had to get my own refills a few times and wait a bit for my beers but for how delicious the food was id do it again. I just called them and they said otro café is their other restaurant and they are relocating Gallo Blanco. Looking forward to checking out their new spot!

So I have been a member at LA fitness Las Sendas in East Mesa for over 3 yrs now and I absolutely love it. I came to this gym because I figured being in a nicer part of Scottsdale it would be just as nice as mine if not nicer... Well, I was wrong. Its pretty tiny and when I walked in they just set the barcode scanner out so you can scan yourself in and nobody was maning the desk. I found my way to the locker room and it was disgusting. It looks like nobody has mopped the floor in years. I changed out and tried not to touch anything. I went into the free weights area and it looks half the size of a garage. It was tiny.. They had 2 adjustable benches, and of course those were being used by people doing bicep curls.... they had 3 seated benches for shoulder press, and a decline bench just taking up space.. It was 4pm and it was already crowded. I got a pretty good workout in but had to wait a few times for people to move it along. I did realize I only saw 1 staff member the whole time I was there training someone and still no one cleaning... After my workout I was going to use the sauna but was afraid to walk barefoot fearing I would contract scabies, diabetes, mono, herpes, or gingivitis from the nasty brown floor. For being in a nicer part of town I was not expecting this place to be so run down and unmaintained...

My wife, daughter and I decided to go get pedicures on Saturday afternoon. As a man it sometimes feels weird to walk into a nail salon wanting a pedicure, not at this place. They were very accommodating and nice. The group of women (customers) however have to stare and make it a tad awkward but I've gotten past that. All 3 of us got the Deluxe Pedicure and as much as I like the fact I'm taking care of my feet, I like the fact its just relaxing. I put my headphones in and let the young lady go to town. I have been to many other nail salons and i feel like Happy Feet tried to make it seem like your getting a 5 star treatment, but in reality only getting 3. My lady made it seem like she really took her time with my feet. She spent a lot of time massaging my legs and karate chopping my back at the end (supposed to be a massage). I feel like she should have spent more time on my feet. Callus remover is already included in the package and after I got home i realized she barely did the heal and overall did very minimal to my feet. While your there it seemed like she was really taking care of me, but I had my eyes closed and my headphones in enjoying the moment. For 45 dollars, it was not worth my time or money. There is too many nail salons that do fantastic jobs in the area to spend your money at a place that gives the image they are giving you the 5 star treatment. I had actually noticed the lady next to me eagle eyeing her nail tech, and correcting her a few times. I guess i should have done the same thing. Overall the location is very nice, clean and up to date... Of course a clean facility doesn't give you the service you pay for.

This is my local watering hole. Jody and his wife are the new owners and it has gotten a lot More drama free and chill. I love this place the food is always amazing, from there wings, to sliders, to California chicken sandwhich to their burgers. Happy hour till 6, and everyone is friendly... This place is like Cheers. This place is amazing during football season. They have nice flat screens everywhere, so you can watch all the games. I would truly suggest to stop by for a brewja or some chow. Its worth it.

Ive been coming here since it opened. I love the food here, and i think its time they name a burger after me. They are also very good about customizing the food for you, my favorites are the burgers and wings and mini sliders and i founded the buffalo chicken sandwhich here. Beer is the same everywhere, but for some reason it tastes like the end of a rainbow and there are tiny leprachauns dancing around a marvelous pot of gold in your MOUTH. They have a bunch of different kinds of beers on tap, i prefer my Coors Light though.  This place has a inviting firendly atmosphere. The bartenders are all great and fast, and they are all friendly.   This place has become my favorite bar thoughout the years. Everyone there including the customers are great. I have made some great friends hanging out there, and evertime i go there its hard to leave because i have such a great time. If your looking for amazing chow and a cold beer in a chill atmosphere On the Green is a spot to try out.

This place is a great local restaurant, I have been going here for a few years. They always have something going on. We went again last night and the atmosphere is a great. It was taco Tuesday and they have 2 Tecates for 5 bucks which is cheap and delicious! They had a live band from 6-9 which we missed because we got there at 850. After the band they still had music going on the jukebox. If you go there and get Tecate ask for a glass with Tajin around the rim. Its a Mexican chili powder that makes the drink phenomenal. They closed at 11, but still weren't rushing to get us out, so it was very cool to not have to be in a hurry. The food ill admit is not super authentic, but delicious. Tacos are good, chimichangas are great, we got some Peppers wrapped in bacon that were amazing... Its a nice chill place to relax after work, get some chow and a few brews.

Man this place is going downhill... Bartender was pretty good, other young bartender was too busy flirting and flexing and paying undivided attention to the old drink regular that was super inappropriate to everyone who walked it. I went outside for a minute and left my sister in law in the cantina and that drink side decided he wanted to be inappropriate to her. As soon as I walked back in he went back to his corner of the bar. I found out they got rid of the jukebox which sucked since they were playing 90's. I asked if they could play some country which they did but they had to argue and explain to the drunk regular why. He had the balls to talk crap from across the bar and instead of just calming him, they told him I asked for the country music and how they would only do a couple songs then change it back... Yes your right... Please the drunk inappropriate regular, and screw anyone else... The toritos were pretty good they were a tad salty. The cantina burrito however tasted like dog food. I don't think I'll be heading back there.

I have this place 2 stars because of the view. Sitting on the patio, it overlooks the fountain hills fountain. Aside from the view the place is not worth going to... Our party of 4 quickly got sat down. Server brought us out drinks and quickly brought us our adult beverages... We were chatting quite a bit so the 3 times the waiter came to get our order we had to tell him to come back. He seemed very attentive and I appreciated that. After we finally got our order place he never came back to check on us. I had to keep going up to him at the waiters station and ask for another round for the table. Other waitress and bussboys delivered our food and came to clean up our table. As for our food it was blah!I got the Mediterranean chicken with mashed taters, and broccoli and my only thought was why would they drench this in salt... I couldn't taste anything else then salt. Even this morning, the next day as I'm writing this im, tasting salt. It pretty nasty. My wife got the buffalo chicken sandwich and she said it was gross had no flavor. She didn't even eat half of her sandwich. We were with friends so we didn't want to complain in front of them. We just learned next time we will go elsewhere.

We ate lunch here for 2 reasosn... there was no wait and I love country music. We ordered chicken bites as a appetizer, do yourself the favor and don't waste your money. I got the jalapeño burger and I'm glad I did. Burned my mouth in the best way possible. Wife got Avacado chicken sandwich and devoured that bad boy.

Love this place. I love dancing and women. This place has a ton of both. Big dance floor and women everywhere to look at. Country music all night long. They got beer specials till 1030, this place is fun to hang out at. The east valley needed a place like this. They surpassed all my expectations. You can easily drop 120 bucks a night here and thats what i usually blow. Its well worth it though. Anyone can have a blast here, mostly old people till they have their warm shots of milk at like 800 and then it gets filled with the younger crown.

Going to fili-b's you already know you are either drunk or just want some Horrendous Mexican food. I've been going to filibertos in the area for the last 17 yrs... I gotta say this one is the worst.. I've had several wrong orders and I speak spanish, when I call they yell at me and make me feel like I should apologize... I will never go back this location main and power consistently gives you the correct order of shitty drunk food...

So i came to this place when it first opened and it was ok. Cheap beer made my trip worth it. My first experience with the food there was horrible. Waitress kept saying she was checking on the prime rib. finally did 30 min later and brought it out cold. My buddy ordered the patty melt and he straight looked at me and said "how in the hell do you mess this up". After 30 more min. Hells Angels walked in and that was our que to leave...  We tried it again last night after vowing i would never return. Bartender was fast, and courteous, Karaoke was fun. But after being there for a hour, it got hot as hell because 3 out of the 7 fans in the bar were broken, then people around me were talking about how they couldn't believe the owner... They were Saying his wife had just left and how he was taking a female singer to a band he booked to his office to bang her out. This was coming from their "friends" and a couple employees..... This was pretty inappropriate for a owner to be doing in his establishment for everyone to know. Owner found out i knew and had a chat with me and bought me a beer. talking about how long he had been married and all... To be honest with you all. It was straight drama filled. complete ridiculousness... I will never step foot in that bar again. Stay away from this place if you wanna have a good time....... I'd rather watch paint dry.... with a beer in my hand of course.

Best wings I've ever had!  Atl style wings and fries are off the hook! The employees or maybe owner was so nice, made some wings for us to try before we even ordered,  and after our meal they brought us delicious biscuits with honey and powdered sugar!  I love 30 min away and I'll definately be making the drive for more. great southern hospitality!

Went back and took my parents. I absolutely love this place, and my parents consider themselves wing condisouers. I have taken them to several places and each time critiquing each place. We got to atl wings and they got the Cajun hot wings and I got old school atl style rub. My parents loved it! They loved the fact it wasn't super sloppy and the loved the flavor. I let them try mine and they also loved those. Usually they try to tell me where else are we trying next time.. Instead they said when are we coming back here. After lunch I got some biscuits and again phenomenal! I'm on a low carb diet and I couldn't resist having one! This place is the bomb dignity. So yourself a favor and try this place. I've even told my wife once I was going to take her somewhere fancy for date night and brought here to Atl. She gave me a look, but appreciated because it was her first time trying Atl!

Except for their overpriced beer and overpriced drinks. this place is just ok. I went a few times when they opened. Nice place I was impressed at how nice it looked inside. I asked the manager what was good there because my buddy and i were gonna get some chow. i asked him about the nachos, he looked at me and said quitely... "DONT GET THOSE"... he told us the cheese tasted funky and he would never recommend those. LOL. we laughed at the fact this guy was trash talking his own bar. This is the kinda place i would go to if there was absolutely nothing else going on around town.

I've gone to the other fat willys locations and the vibe is usually great and thought I'd come here for lunch. This is a golf bar and grill so it's mostly old people, but compared to the other fat willys this place has way better food. I recommend the philly. Was delicious.

Came here to see a all time favorite of mine Keith Anderson!!! Didn't think it was going to be so small but I loved it! Im a huge fan of live country music and aside from having a super grungy vibe this place is a perfect place for it.. You get a kind of creepy vibe walking in, kind of like saying a "Hail Mary" in hopes you don't get shanked. After getting in its just a regular dive bar and the bartenders and most the security staff was very kind and polite. We hung out by the bar and watched the 2 openers, and then moved our way up to the stage, which wasn't hard because it was pretty dead. I didn't care however, because I felt like a school girl listening to my favorite songs from Keith Anderson and his guitar... No band all acoustic, this place was made for this kinda act. There is a nice dance floor right in front of the stage where I danced and spun the closest girl that would let me around the dance floor. After the concert Keith Anderson hung out signed a couple autographs and we closed the place down! He came over and had a couple drinks with us and just BS'd. It was one of the best nights ever... So my advice to anyone wanting to come here is: Come with a open mind and you'll be happy and surprised... Come stuck up and you'll be miserable.

I'm writing this on behalf of my dad, and also being a son that is depended on non stop. My dad had his starter go out on the car and I was thinking about changing it myself. I decided because of the year I would call around to get some pricing. Other garages were trying to price gouge, this place offered the best price and a warranty on the part. I was actually on the phone with them when they told,me my dad was already there. Lol.... He decided to take the car in his own. Please keep in mind my dad is 78 and speaks Spanish mostly. They were very nice to him and have him a ride home, they even picked him up to get his car. For a fair price and amazing customer service my dad told me this is the best and he will make this his local garage he takes his car to. Thank you for helping out my dad and making sure he got taken care of. I will recommend them to anyone I know.

After telling my dad it was a part that needed to be changed and him paying to get it changed, the same problem happened again with his car. So he took it back and they fixed something else for another 350 bucks... Seems like this problem should have been diagnosed originally. He spent over 600 on a part that should have only coated 350... This trumps my original post. You can be the friendliest person in the world if a error is made that makes me pay extra money my trust will go down. We've started using another shop since this experience.

Small taco place that has probably the best tacos I've found so far!!! It might have been the beer, but pretty sure it wasn't. Its A small shop with self serve Pico Dr Gallo which was delicious and spicy, limes, and salsa. My only complaint is they only offered flour tortillas from what I saw. Either that or I got it as default. A corn tortilla would have earned this place 5 stars! Delicious carne asada made right behind the cashier over a wood fire, doesn't get,more authentic then that... If it wasn't for that flour tortilla...... I think I might hit it back up and bring,my own corn! Definatly hit it up for a late night bite! Totally worth it!!!  *** update *** apparently seen in their update they do sell corn tortillas!!! That's all I was missing to have one of the best street tacos in East valley area! Congrats man... I'm very picky about my tacos!

Came for a Bachelor Party and was significantly disappointed. We went on a busy Friday night with the understanding this was a country Bar/ Club... I felt like I was at a MMA event with all the Affliction everywhere.. The dance floor was completely packed with people just standing around fist pumping to techno country music... several people thought it was smart to try to grab at my cowboy hat and try to put it on, one guy in the bathroom line got frisky after I scolded him after he tried to grab my hat. Maybe I've just gotten to old (32) to deal with 21 yr. olds, but this was just not for me. I love country music and beer drinking rowdiness, but this looks like someone dumped a room full of "North Scottsdale" in a room. This is not for the true Country fan... I can barely see in there with all the affliction and ed hardy bedazzled shirts in there. Overall was a fun night (mostly because of my group). True trendy club at its best.

I went to a empty Pacino's last night thinking it was another pizza joint. After the bartender advised where I was at I decided to go ahead and order the pizza for take out for my family. I saw their pictures on the website for pizza and it looked really good. I was placing the order and the bartender told me I should just do the smaller personal pizzas since they are on special and they are big enough to fill you up. I went ahead and ordered 3 to take home along with a Caesar salad. I had a couple beers while waiting. After I got my food I went home and opened the boxes only to find what looked like store bought frozen pizza (it tasted like it too, Little Caesar pizza would have tasted better). Only 1 looked like it was fresh. All of the pizzas looked like they were trying to conserve cheese because inly 25% of the pizza had cheese on it, Even the cheese pizza for my daughter was not covered with cheese.  It was disgusting. My Caesar salad was a complete disappointment since it had no croutons and I think they were hoarding the dressing since my Caesar dressing cup was just filled 1/4 full. You would think since the restaurant was dead they would be paying more attention to the food they were putting out and serving to the customers...  I suggest anyone who is hungry and is thinking about ordering pizza from here go to your local grocery store buy a red baron pizza and save yourself a lot of money and enjoy  a better product then what you would get at Pacino's.

After getting into it with the owner for a bit and told I was wrong and they have one of the best Pizza in the Valley. I still disagree... He gave me a gift card for the total I paid to try it again. My friend and I went back yesterday to give it another shot. Im rating it 2 stars because the service was great. The food however was still pretty gross and not consistent. I had fried mozzarella which was bland, and I regretted eating the meatball sliders at 3 in the morning. I tried my friends truffle fries those were bland. I also tried a slice of his pizza I still agree your better off with Red Baron Pizza from Albertsons. My buddy agreed. Total disappointment. I will never walk into that place again.

Came for my birthday. Gotta say I just expected a delicious taco with all the hype.... This is a super trendy taco joint, great vibe, great customer service. However the food was a let down. The tacos are piled with stuff that takes away from the little akward flavor the meats had. The best thing I absolutely loved is the corn tortillas it came on. They seemed fresh and homemade. For the price you are paying I was expecting authentic bomb street tacos, instead I paid for what looked like art in a tortilla, it looked nice but wasnt up to par with the taco cart in Juarez. It was a big disappointment when you can get a better taco from a taco cart, then you can from this potentially awesome restaurant. So if your into food photography this is the best place to snap some pics, if you are craving a authentic bomb taco, look elsewhere.

I usually give bars a standard of 3 stars just for having beer but this place only gets 2...My life is probably at stake over this review because rumor is Hells Angels own this Cantina!!! So I went here to hang with a couple buddies, 1 was playing poker, the other was drinking and as I walked it a smell overcame me.. It was kinda like Ball Sweat and tarter sauce. I went to the bar and watched the bartender who was acting like she was hopped up on something chit chat it up with a few guys at the bar without even noticing I was standing there. Keep in mind there was only like 15 people in the whole bar and 3 of them were sitting at the bar, on top of it I look like donkey kong so im pretty hard to miss. After about 5 minutes I started saying loudly "excuse me" and finally got her attention. I ordered a beer and a couple shots my buddy. I told him I wanted to go to a different bar but our other stubborn friend was winning money at the poker tournament and he didn't want to leave. So we stuck it out... We drank beer and hung outside in their patio. The bar itself is really nice aside from the smell, the crowd is more rough bikers, and again they already have the reputation to be a Hells Angels bar... We hung out and almost closed down the bar and most of the night I was on guard even watching my back in the bathroom so I don't get shanked by a sharpened toothbrush. HAHA! All this place is missing is a creepy guy in the corner table using a pen ink and paperclip trading his tattoos for top ramen and cigarettes. Id go elsewhere.

They have a ton of stuff all over the walls,  however they love to just put things in your hand without telling you bad side effects.  I decided to go back to driving 6 miles away to go to vitamin world over this place... People here are just not educated in the products how they work and if it's OK to take them with other stuff.  Seems like they just jam crap into their bodies because they think it'll make them huge..... If you know your stuff about supplements may wanna try it out,  if your newer to the try somewhere else. Also a little overpriced...

I recommended this place to the family for dinner because I saw it on yelp. We drove up and I was kinda nervous since it was in the corner of a dim lit strip mall. We walked in and it was amazingly beautiful. The ambience was great, and it was so clean. We sat dawn and ordered our drinks and some chow. It all came in a timely fashion. My wife and I got the brisket and mac and cheese, daughter got smoked turkey and my family got a smoked for 2 sampler. We devoured our food. It was so delicious. I was shocked at how good it was. We didn't leave any leftovers. We finished it off with a delicious jack Daniels brownie... I would recommend to anyone looking for good smoked chow!

Came to the brass tap after a cubs game. It was fun! I think I'm not meant to go to craft beer bars though. I asked my bartender if he could recommend a beer that is similar to coors light since that's what I love to drink. He looked at me and said "yeah I can serve you a glass of water"... then continued to give me a blank look.. I chuckled and said "ok, OK good one. I'm not into craft beers so if you could recommend something like coors light I'd appreciate it"... again he said "yeah I told you a glass of water". This was inappropriate since I was trying to give him hard earned American currency for a beer. I ended up just getting what my buddy got a blonde ale, which the bartender could have recemmended instead of being a smart ass.the rest of the visit was great. Food was delicious, I got chicken wrap with peri peri sauce which was amazing! I'll definitely go back since I know I like the blonde ale, and I don't have to ask the beer snob.

The owners have changed this place around a lot!!! Its become more of what its meant to be a sports bar and less family restaurant. I go to another bar down the street but when I don't want to drive coming here is nice. The food is pretty good, but I go to bars for the cold drinks and atmosphere. It would be nice to have a jukebox in there. but overall nice!

Alright, Well the beer is delicious, but that is the same for 98% of the bars in mesa that serve cold beer. The food however has become subpar. I went on Taco Tuesday and ordered what they told me are the street tacos. Right away I lit up like a kid on Christmas!!! Street Tacos are my favorite!! I ordered 3 shredded beef Street tacos and the waiter assured me these are authentic street tacos after I asked a million questions.They brought 3 cold corn tortillas with a blob of crock pot beef roast... It was disgusting. I even told the waiter the least they could have done was shred the beef. I took 1 bite after shredding it myself and the meat had no flavor and was chewy as hell. (being Mexican I had to say a quick prayer for the restaurant to be forgiven for serving and calling it tacos). There is a recipe on the world wide web that could have been followed and tasted phenomenal, but instead they served blob, fatty piece of pot roast, which was quickly returned.... I have not gone back to Echo 5 for tacos since then.

So I am a newbie when it comes to sushi, but Ive fallen in love with it and fallen in love with this place. I hate going to restaurants and only being able to try a few rolls and already having a tab of 30 bucks. This place I tried so many different rolls on their badass conveyer belt and its sooo not expensive. Each plate is between 1.5 dollars to 3 bucks. We had a stack of plates and 4 big brewjas and it only came out to 40 dollars.... Will definitely be back loved the atmosphere and the chill mood.

Absolutely love this place. Food is great, service is fast. Im glad they just opened one in Gilbert. We've already been there. If your looking for something delicious and new try chicken and waffles you will not be disappointed.

Never knew what a italian beef was until I married a Chicago girl! Now I absolutely love them. From what I know portillos is a Chicago icon, known for their italian beefs... Every time I go there I get the same thing big beef extra gaurdina with mozzarella cheese, large fry with dipping cheese! Something Chicagoans like is there italian beefs dipped in the juice, to me that's gross so I get the juice in the side. It's bomb chow and there is no place in the valley that makes them so good except for my wife at home... She can blow those out of the water. I know they sell tamales, let's be honest if your going to trust and try a tamale from a Chicago based restaurant be ready to be disappointed. They are squeezed out of a tube and look like something that should be thrown directly in the toilet.

So we stopped in to have a few beers on a Sunday afternoon, and I gotta say I was impressed. The beer was delicious. They look very clean and everything is new. This would have gotten 5 stars as a fist timer here, but the bartender kept 1 of those.... I'm new to these breweries and i'm used to my Coors Light. So when I walk into a place like this it sucked that the bartender was acting like a snob. My friend and I asked a couple question and I swear he acted like he was disgusted that we didn't know everything about the beers.  Maybe he had a crazy Saturday night and partied with Snoop Dogg and Dre, and spent his early morning flying back from the huge party that they had on their Yacht in Miami, where Alf and the a Kardashian made a guest appearance, or maybe he just got hammered in his Apt with his old frat friends... Either way he looked miserable and was being snobby, we would have probably stayed there for another couple rounds instead of walking across the street to another bar if it wasn't for him. We'd def. be willing to try it again though. I wont let a beer snob between me and my sweet, delicious beer.

45 min later and we still don't have our food... service is extremely slow and they are only maybe 25% full. I asked the host to turn the jukebox up after depositing money in my touch tunes app only to get a rude remark from her... that took all my strength to not go off on her since she was a young girl... I was called high maintenance from my waitress because I asked my burger to be made a specific way (I'm carb backloading). Cubs game will start in 20 min... we'll miss some of it I guess, so if your looking for a quick bite and beer. Go elsewhere. **** update.... food was pretty good. But for the service and the attitudes. I'd say go elsewhere. Gane started and we are barely leaving this place. I regret this decision.
