I love this restaurant. It is a hole in the wall and yes they charge for chips but the food is excellent. Worth the drive since it's not super close by. Customer service is always wonderful and o always enjoy eating at Rositas.

Love this place, its a little small but not a big deal. Customer service is always really great and  the drinks are awesome. Perfect for a nice pregame to a date or night cap after a nice dinner.

I love trying new places(especially Chinese) and this place was not good.  We ordered from Flamingo Palace because we were lazy and were looking for the closest Chinese that would deliver. We have only been in the area for a few weeks so relied heavily upon reviews. I ordered a couple of items and everything was super bland.  The General Tso chicken and the Orange Chicken looked identical- IMO- at a good Chinese restaurants, you should be able to tell a difference between general tso and Orange without having to read what the box says.  There was more breading than chicken and hardly any meat in the special fried rice.  I will not be going back to Flamingo even if someone offered it for free and I was 3 days starving.  Good luck!

My BF's mom was in town and had to get her toes done late- This place stayed open late for us.  only 4 stars because I don't really know the quality of work since I didn't get anything done.  But thank you for staying open late, great customer service!

Food was gross- I got the house chicken with rice and it was horrible.  I will never go back. Just nasty.

YUMMM!  Great food.  Venue is a little dated but it doesn't matter since the food is so good.  Very authentic.

Ordered Rolled chicken tacos and a side of rice and beans. I've said this on other reviews and I'll say it again.. I'm a huge critic of Mexican food because honestly it's really hard to mess up. Surprisingly the beans were the best part even though they were not great. The rolled chicken tacos were EXTREMELY DRY(not to mention extremely small)  and the rice was so dry it tasted like bits of cardboard were mixed In. I ate it because I was starving and couldn't leave to go and get anything else. I wouldn't go back.

I LOVE this place and all these lame reviews will not stop me from going back.  I usually only get a lunch special to go (cheap by the way).  They have THE BEST orange chicken and KUNG PAO.  I have been trying to find a good chinese place comparable to China Gate but NO luck.  Every time I eat at any other Chinese places, I always end up saying "its good, but it's no China Gate".  This is by far my favorite chinese restaurant.

Really good food but prices are too high for what you get.  Oh and when you order chips and salsa, they give you chips and black beans and a little tiny salsa. lol.

Pretty decent Pho but I've had better; I've definitely had worse also. I also tried the shrimp spring roll, it is was decent also.

The place is AWESOME! I love the Place and come here whenever I can. Yes the wait may be a little long but it is worth the wait and you definitely get more bang for your buck.   A few honorable mentions:  -The bacon is amazing. Biggest pieces of bacon in AZ(from my experience).  -There is a napkin dispenser at every table(I'm a napkin queen) -Mimosas are huge and cheap  Service is just Ok but the food speaks for itself.

Service is a little slow but WHO CARES since the food is SO GOOD.  I used to go to the Snooze in Denver when I visited and have always ordered One Bella Bella, one different kind of benny(changes every time but HAVE to have at least one Benny, and share a flight of pancakes.  I usually get a pancake of the day, pineapple and a chocolate chip with white and regular chips.  So Good.  You're crazy if you don't go here just because they have an hour wait for the table. One last thing-- I HATE pancakes but i LOVE them here. :)

The food was great!  The ordering system was not so great.  I was 2nd in line and had to wait a very long time.  I was not a fan of that system.  The fountain drink area was fun since they're different products what you don't expect to see- I like that they switched it up.  Our server was the worst server I'd had in my whole life, I really hope they invest in some training for Mariana if they decide to keep her.  She is completely clueless about everything and rarely finished a sentence; I'm embarrassed for her actually. Other than the weird ordering/ seating process and horrible server, I would recommend this place because the great food and cool atmosphere.
