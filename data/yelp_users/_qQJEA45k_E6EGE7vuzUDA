Mmmmmm...just thinking about this place makes my mouth water! I always get the shaved ice here, so that's what I'll review. First of all, a shaved ice is a great treat to have when you're watching your weight...225 calories (add 75 for tropic creme) for a small one & it hits the spot! The small isn't really small either...it's a tiny mountain of fluffy, frozen, sugary goodness.   I like that if you want something smaller a "baby" size is available :) (169 calories). They also have sugar-free options. Lots of flavors to choose from...I love to get 2 flavors side-by-side, usually pineapple & coconut.   This location, unlike others I've been to, has a drive-thru which is nice, but if there are cars ahead of you be prepared to wait awhile. I believe they close at 10:30 pm. The only drawback (like another poster mentioned) is it's in a pretty ghetto area.

Just based on my opinion: Bashas is crap...Safeway is good, but tends to be expensive...Albertson's, meh...Food City, ICK!...AJ's is fabulous (if you're a millionaire-don't get me wrong, I like to buy a couple items on occasion, but you need serious moola to shop there on a regular basis). Out of all the grocery stores I could shop at I choose Fry's. I've been to several in the Valley & I like this one the best. It's especially nice that we live practically right next door.     This Fry's was re-modeled awhile back & definitely looks more updated than a lot of the others. Most of the employees have genial dispositions with the exception of a couple crab-balls (eh...every store is gonna have them). A decent selection of groceries, great prices, and regular discounts make this my favorite grocery store.

*3.5 stars*  In the interest of supporting local AZ businesses, my husband and I had dinner here on my b-day (5/13). The first thing I observed is that they have a couple walk-up windows on the southside of the building so you can place your order and get food without having to go inside. Thought that was pretty clever! We arrived close to 8 pm and it was still pretty busy inside, but the line moved quickly.   The restaurant is set up cafeteria style with a kitschy country look. There is a huge mural on one wall dedicated to farm living and a John Deere tractor with accompanying bric-a-brac on the other side. Once we got through the line, I choose the meat plate with 2 sides...beef brisket and pulled pork for my meats, mac 'n' cheese and beans for my sides. I really wanted to get chicken instead of the pork, but they had unfortunately run out of chicken :( . My hubby got the full slab of pork ribs with sweet cut corn and mac 'n' cheese for his sides. We shared a piece of cornbread and for dessert, split the root beer cake. Happily I received a discount on my meal because it was my birthday (they advertise a "free" meal, though it's basically $10 off).  The beef brisket and pulled pork were so good! Tender, juicy, and delicious! Those meats really are the best reason to go Joe's. The beans and mac 'n' cheese were just ok...so far Fleming's beats everyone hands down when it comes to mac 'n' cheese! The cornbread was so-so, tasted like it came from a box, but the honey butter that comes with it made it pretty tasty. Regrettably, my husband's pork ribs were pretty fatty as compared to Lucille's (Tempe Marketplace). The root beer cake was good, but not as delectable as we thought it would be. Maybe we were expecting too much after reading how much fellow Yelpers enjoyed it? Another thing worth mentioning (some others have commented on it too) is how strange the beverage station is. It's smack dab at the front of the line where you get your food so you have to fight your way through the crowd (if there is one) to get a refill. Weird.     To conclude, Lucille's is still our #1 favorite place for BBQ, but we would still go to Joe's again.

*3.5 stars*  My hunny loves this place, so we went for his birthday last Friday. I'm glad I made reservations because the restaurant was packed (like sardines *har har*) when we arrived at 6:30 pm. It was VERY LOUD inside...This is NOT a good place for a first date because my husband and I were practically yelling and we still could barely hear each other. The 4-man N'awlins band playing was complimentary to the atmosphere, but the music just added to the din. Phil was our waiter and he was friendly and personable.  We started with soup...hubs enjoyed his shrimp gumbo, although he and I thought my cup of lobster bisque was better (my mouth is watering as I'm typing this!) The french bread that came out before the meal was standard and nothing special. My entree was filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I also added king crab legs which my sweetie and I shared. The filet was cooked right, but didn't have much flavor...had to ask for A-1 (gasp!) The asparagus were downright delicious and the taters were yummy too. Crab legs were fresh and tasty. I liked the tealight our server brought to the table to melt the butter for my crab because it kept the butter melted throughout dinner. My husband got mahi mahi with etouffee on top (came with dirty rice) and he was transported to food heaven.  I had a weird experience when I excused myself to go to the restroom. After admiring my hair, a woman (that I had never met) told me she was a spiritualist, said she saw lots of tension around me, and saw lots of change in my future. All I saw was the crab shell that had lodged itself in my eye when I had attempted to crack it. Along with the tears running down my cheek because of said crab shell. Bet you can imagine how annoying it was to be accosted in the bathroom...and it was......but I just can't be rude to someone who says I have pretty hair. Even if she was a wacka-doo.  Next time we go to Pappadeaux's I'm going to avoid the crab and the ladies restroom.......  Just kidding.  I'll still get the crab.

*4.5 stars*  Whenever BBQ cravings hit, my husband and I go to Lucille's. We've been here a number of times and rarely do we have a bad experience. I would suggest getting here before you're absolutely starving because there's usually a big crowd and the wait runs from 20 min to an hour+ on weekends (obviously the busiest).   The restaurant is sectioned off into several rooms and has a down-home Southern vibe to it, from the old-timey framed photographs and wall art, to the screened "porch" with the shabby chic bench. Once seated, we start off with strawberry lemonade in huge glass mason jars and homemade biscuits with apple butter...so yummy!   We usually share the Combo Porch Platter (it has the right amount of food for 2 or 1 REALLY hungry person) with my husband getting the Baby Back Ribs, myself getting the BBQ Tri-Tips (the Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket are good too) and we split the half chicken. So delish!  Also, the nice thing about Lucille's is that there are 4-5 different BBQ sauces sitting on the table to choose from. The 2 sides we normally select are the mashed sweet potatoes and potato salad. I've sampled the BBQ beans, mac 'n' cheese, and the coleslaw and have found all to be sadly lacking.  We're almost always too stuffed to get dessert, but when we have ordered, we've gotten the Old-Fashioned Banana Pudding and the Peach Fruit Cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Skip the pudding...it was bland and tasteless. On the other hand, the peach fruit cobbler was heavenly! Sweet, flaky, warm crust with juicy peaches and cold vanilla bean ice cream...mmm-mmm good (drool)   So, with a check of around $35 (when sharing the Combo Porch Platter), scrumptious food and lemonade, and left-overs that warm up great at home...Lucille's is #1 in our book.

My husband took me here for a special birthday dinner on 5/15 and I really wanted to like this place, but it just didn't work out that way :( . Maybe it's because we aren't "gourmet" foodies? I dunno.  We found it strange that this upscale restaurant is situated in a strip mall, but it IS a nice strip mall (lol) with a pretty water fountain and cute furniture/home goods shops nearby. The interior of Cork is small, yet really cool and modern with a chain mesh curtain running down the middle and suede seats in the booths. When we were seated, we were given menus that read "Happy Birthday, Rebecca!" at the top which I thought was very sweet.    All items are tapas style (essentially lots of small meals) which I enjoy because I love to sample several dishes. We started with salads. The Baby Arugula had fried goat cheese, pieces of watermelon and strawberries, cashews, and a blood orange poppy seed vinaigrette. The Organic Green Salad had blue cheese, spiced caramel popcorn, slices of pear, and a balsamic vinaigrette. Both were tasty, but I liked the Arugula the best. Next, we decided on Cork's Mac and Cheese which consisted of BBQ pork belly, smoked bacon, and cheddar (normally comes with mushrooms too, but my husband hates them). It was good, but nothing special. Especially in comparison to Fleming's drop-dead delicious mac 'n' cheese.   Finally, we ordered the Honey Glazed Duck Breast (mango sopapilla, duck confit, and cantaloupe gazpacho relish) and the Surf & Turf (tempura shrimp, honey lavender glazed ostrich, coconut milk, chorizo fried rice, and spicy mustard) These dishes were hugely disappointing to us. Let me mention that I've never had duck or ostrich so that could have been part of the problem. The ostrich tasted like cheap stew meat and the duck was just nasty. Our super nice server (forget his name, sorry!) was very thoughtful and did say he could bring us something else, but we were pretty much done by then. We shared the banana creme pie for dessert and that was incredibly creamy and luscious.    The 2 major reasons we will most likely never come back to Cork is:  Number 1) The food made my husband really crabby......he was seriously grumpy afterwards.  and (***WARNING: the following will be TMI for some of you***)  Number 2) Literally!!! About 15 minutes after eating here, I had the WORST squirts of my life. It was sooooo bad, UGH!

My husband & I took my 14 year old sister here Halloween night of '09. To start off, my sis & I had to use the bathroom (us girls have little bladders!)......there were porta-potties. I know from previous experiences that porta-potties aren't the cleanest things, but these little closets of stench were DISGUSTING. To add to that, there wasn't any toilet paper, so I had to drip dry (ewww) and the one my lil sis used wouldn't lock and some guy opened the door! I had to run over there and stand in front of the door to make sure no one else walked in on her. With the money they charge, you would think that they could at least make sure that the porta-potties had tp and the locks worked!  I'd like to point out that Fear Farm was situated in a dirt field with rocks...meaning girls, be careful of the choice of shoes you wear. Although I did see the predictable array of skanky costumes complete with stripper heels, so if you think you can rock them without busting your azz, then go for it. There was a good mix of people (including a few lone old pervs staring at anything female walking by...yick), but the overwhelming majority were teens.   $19 per person got us in 4 of the venues (you get a punch card that a worker will punch when you enter each one). Be prepared to wait in lines...some had up to a 1/2 hour (or more) wait time. We went through "The Asylum", "Carnevil", and "Apocalypse", but ended up skipping "Chainsaw Mayhem" because my husband was getting annoyed with the characters running noisy chainsaws by his face. The exhibits weren't that scary and for the most part they relied heavily on the old hiding-and-jumping-out-at-you-and screaming-in-your-face routine throughout each place. I thought The Asylum was the most creative/interesting haunted attraction because you had to go through a ton of different rooms and you didn't know where the doors were in some of them. However, I wasn't crazy about a couple of the workers yelling "Wow, you've got huge boobs!" in 3 seperate rooms. One female character even asked what size bra I wore. Can you say inappropriate?     Good news for the hungry......there were food stands similar to what you would see at the State Fair or any other carnival. Beverages, cotton candy, hot pretzels, turkey legs, and funnel cakes were some of the offerings. We split a funnel cake with powdered sugar that was surprisingly scrumptious (YUM!). In addition, there were stalls with face painting, temporary tattoos, and glow-in-the-dark items for sale.   To sum it up......My husband & I most likely won't ever go back, but my sis loved it and had a great time. IMO, Fear Farm is best suited to young teenagers and families with kids ages 8 and up. If you want to get the bejeebers scared out of you I'd suggest looking elsewhere.

I love coming here for the rolls & honey butter alone...Delish :) I totally have a food-gasm from eating them!!! This buffet wins hands down over any other. The last time I went to a buffet my sister (unfortunately) wanted to go to Old Country & it sucked hard-core. Dry food, unappetizing flavors, crappy choices, etc.  If you're wanting to stuff yourself silly go here...great selection of food to choose from. I especially like the sweet potatoes, Bourbon Street Chicken with rice, and meatloaf. Skip the mac 'n' cheese...very bland...blech.   The wait staff is ok, no one particulary friendly or fast, but I doubt anyone expects exemplary service from a buffet. This location is a bit better/cleaner than the other one at Stapley/Cooper.
