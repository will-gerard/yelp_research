So, I have to admit, when I initially saw the racetrack and electric cars I was not convinced that this would be a lot of fun. How fast can electric cars in an indoor track really go?  Turns out, pretty dang fast.  This place is immaculately clean and they have plenty of activities to keep your group occupied while waiting for your time slot. Arcade games, a climbing wall, a snack bar to name a few.  The race was a blast, you are given a paper copy of your scorecard and one is also emailed to you.   The only reason I have rated at 4 stars is that it is a little pricey for a few minutes on the track and the wait time, we went on a weekday and still had to wait nearly two hours for a time slot.

This has been bookmarked for a while because I am on a hot search for the BEST PHO in PHOenix. I was finally on the Chandler side of life over the weekend, so I excitedly stopped into Saigon Pho to get a take out order of Veggie Pho.  The place was PACKED when I arrived, which I took as a great sign. I literally had to carefully pick my way through the packed tables to get to the back of the restaurant to place an order.  I was never greeted or acknowledged, but stood there awkwardly for a few minutes until I finally stopped someone and asked if I could place an order to go. I ordered vegetable pho and waited.  I waited by the scary lobster tank in the back that I am positive Chef Ramsay would find appalling. I know it made me queasy quite a few times.  I was not given any utensils with my to go order, so again I had to wait another awkward few minutes to finally flag someone down to get chopsticks (seriously, who can eat pho without chopsticks, am I right?)  When I arrived home with my long awaited taste of pho...I was disappointed. It was 80% broth, 10 % noodles, 5% vegetables (literally 4 pieces of broccoli and two slices of carrot) and 5% sprouts, onions,basil.  I was still hungry after I finished all five bites of my meal and had to scrounge around my house to find something else to eat.  Will not be back, but glad I can say I tried another place...the search for the best PHO in the valley is still on!

There are endodontists...and then there are INCREDIBLE endodontists.   Dr. Grabow definitely falls into the latter. It may seem strange that there are people out there who are passionate about dentistry, but Dr. Grabow is that man. He is extremely personable, answers questions with patience (I can be a handful, trust me) and explains procedures in a reassuring and easy to understand way.  I was highly impressed with how friendly his staff was and how quick and easy they made my appointment and even offered to see me the same day I called.   If you are in the market for a root canal...you need to see Dr. Grabow. He takes the pain out of a tooth pain.

Elite Nails --  NAILED IT.  I was a little skeptical when I saw the Elite Nails sign...because let's face it, clean nail places are somewhat of a hidden gem in  the East Valley.   Let me say that I was blown away by the cleanliness and gorgeous decor that was awaiting me when I walked through the door. Clean, friendly people, a casual and comfortable atmosphere that is also VERY trendy. They have plenty of massage/pedicure chairs and nail booths...the place is massive inside.  And the best part? They are so reasonably priced! You can get facial waxing for a steal, a mini pedicure for next to nothing...and they do an incredible job.  Try to make an appointment because they fill up pretty quickly with walk ins.  Elite Nails is the cream of the crop. Go get yo nails did.

Mmmm...rice pudding!! Trust me...it's INCREDIBLE. No really, TRUST ME!!  So, obviously (well, obviously), we came here for dessert...and oh wow. So good. The line was a little long...and let me tell you it got even longer after we got in it. but it was worth every second of the wait. Aside from the rice pudding, we also had the bread pudding, which was really great as well.   I am so looking forward to my next trip to Phoenix to try some of the delicious looking pizza. Definitely a cool hangout in Gilbert.

The website boasts of an oil change in 30 minutes or less, so I stopped in because I'm in need of a quick oil change on my lunch break. Imagine my surprise when I was told an hour and a half when I walked in the door.   What happened to 30 minutes or less?   Now I've wasted half of my lunch hour getting here, no oil change and now I'm hangry (translation: hungry + angry).   Next stop: jiffy lube! :)

I have been to my fair share of 24 Hour Fitness locations around the country and this is on the upper side of them.  What's great about this particular location is that the clientele isn't uppity and this isn't a social scene (ahem LA Fitness). People come here to work hard and get it done. It's a clean facility and very no nonsense. You won;t find tv screen on each cardio machine here but everything works well.   The group classes are great Just get there early enough to sign up and get a bright orange or pink slip to secure your place. I would recommend the Body Pump class on Thursday evenings...the instructor is fantastic at keeping you moving and keeping the class fun while being SO nice.  The trainers here are really helpful and constantly offering small tips to help you with your workout such as: you will get better movement if you push your seat back a little or push your elbows in a little closer, etc. or a simple how's your workout going today?I appreciate it because sometimes I have no clue what I'm doing and I'm glad that the employees are friendly enough to stop by and help out.  I did a personal training session with Adrian and I must say, if you are looking for a great workout from a very motivational trainer, you should sign up to see Adrian today. He definitely understands fitness and is constantly encouraging and helpful.

Sofritas, black beans and pico, Oh my!  Seriously, love the chipotle concept, and love even more that they offer shredded, mouth watering, pepper infused, juicy tofu.  This location is great because they are quick and easy to get in and out of...(kinda wish this shopping center would take off a little more though).  The staff was really friendly and helpful and moved the long line  of customers quickly through the process and on to the every wonderful tasty chipotle goodness. I will be back soon!

Looking for a trustworthy car repair shop is stressful, nerve wracking and scary. You worry about the cost, being taken advantage of, missing work because your car will be out of commission, etc etc.   So, let me just make it really easy for you, this is THE best place in the valley to get your vehicle serviced.  Paul, the owner is a car genius! He will make sure that whatever is going on is figured out and fixed up right away. I appreciate the fact that he never tries to sell you something you don't need or adds unneeded repair to your bill. He is up front and honest about the situation. He has been trusted with two of my cars and I have always been grateful for the work he's done.  The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable and above all else, kind and considerate. Highly recommend!

I lived at Cambria for a year and had the best experience! The property is maintained extremely well and it's actually very quiet (I even lived right next to the second pool).   The staff is amazing! Kristen, the property manager is so friendly and always willing to help with any questions. Darcy, the leasing agent is incredibly nice and remembers the name of everyone who lives there.   I moved out of state, otherwise I would have been renewing my lease with Cambria in a heartbeat.   Trust me, you will love living here!

Love it here. I feel like it's a little piece of heaven! They have tons of great vegan/vegetarian options...so much so that you carnivorisaurs will still love it.  The calexico burger...omg. DO it!! Right now! The hummus is so flavorful and amazing. The "burger" itself is a little spicy, but perfectly seasoned. And for you usual meat lovers, I recommend the argentine po-boy. You won;t even notice there isn't meat in it. Trust me.  And save room for a soy-nami. Lots of room, these things are massive. Or share one, because after about 6-7 bites into it you might feel ready to explode. Yes, I know from personal experience.

It's been a while since I have darkened the doors of Buffalo Exchange in Tempe, but now that I am back in the great hot state of AZ, I headed right over.  The store is cleaner and more organized than I ever remember it being, so kudos for that BE. They are a tad overpriced...I mean, if I am going to spend $70 on a pair of jeans, I would rather go to The Rack and get them new, but BE does offer some one of a kind items and lots of fun vintage accessories and styles. And they seem to be better priced on shoes.  I love to come in and browse...my latest find was a pair of BRAND NEW Vince Camuto heels for $30. I had been eyeing these at Macy's for a while but hesitant to pay the $120 price tag so it was quite the find for me at BE.

In love with Oreganos. Like...in love.   Here's a little tip though...figure out what kind of pizza you want BEFORE you arrive so that you can order it when you sit down. Their pizzas can take anywhere from 25-40 minutes to cook, so you don't want to be starving yourself, smelling all the Oreganos goodness, feeling tortured with every table that gets their delicious smelling pizza before you.   Trust me.  Also, save room for pizookie. It's a skillet baked cookie that's just every so slightly underdone so that it's soft and gooey...and then they top it with ice cream. Can you say heaven in a skillet?? Try a half macadamia nut and half chocolate chip so you get the best of both worlds.

I was a regular at TC Eggington's for four years. And when I say regular, I mean every weekend.  The owner, Tom is probably the nicest man you will ever meet. He is extremely welcoming and friendly, even when the place is packed out. He never seems to forget a face and you feel like he's been waiting for you to walk in.  Ok...so now, the most important part of this, the food. Incredible. I mean, what other place do you know that can make something as unappetizing as a bran muffin taste so good that you'll be asking for another one after the first bite? This place.  Aside from the bran muffins, they have an amazing omelet, the Spain. It's just the right amount of spicy or the Vegetable Gardena fritatta. They even make oatmeal that tastes like it came from a gourmet kitchen. Seriously, what other place makes oatmeal like this??  And they must only hire the cutest servers, the girls are all wholesome and sweet, with cute little patterned socks and loafers. It's almost like if you aren't attractive, you are immediately dismissed from the hiring process.  If you haven't been here, you need to march your breakfast loving booty here now and order your heart out.

In love.  Olive and Ivy is a fantastic little place tucked in the waterfront at Scottsdale. They have two sides to choose from, the take out side where it's more of a bistro style, offering sandwiches and salads for a quick meal...and then the elegantly decorated dine in side that has TONS of outdoor seating. This place is gorgeous.  The bar is a great place for happy hour after work or to meet up with friends before a night out...and the restaurant itself offers AMAZING table side mimosas and brunch on the weekends. Delish. Absolutely delish.  If you haven't been here, get here quickly and enjoy every bite and minute of your visit.

Came here on a random whim for the first time a couple of weeks ago with a friend. We were talking about greek fries (translation: I was talking about greek fries) and said friend had never experienced them before. After a quick little yelp search for greek fries, I found Phoenicia!  Holy greek fries. This is the BEST I have ever had anywhere. I could eat them all day, everyday until I get so big that I can't have my own airline seat anymore. Thank God for the gym, y'all.  Aside from the all encompassing greek fires, the falafel is crispy and hecka GOOD.  I have now been here three time sin the last week and a half and I am bringing everyone I know with me.  Oh, and the hummus. WOW. The super hot boyfriend doesn't even like hummus usually and he thought this was amazing. They make it in house and can sell you a small container to take home for $6. We purchased the classic (which is what they serve with their dishes), but I heard mention of a jalepeno/cilantro one that I am definitely going back for when I get through my first container.  The staff is incredibly friendly and you will meet them all at some point during your meal. They all come over and ask if everything is great and offer to refill your water glass. Love this type of teamwork!  Oh, and side note, they are closed on Mondays. Don't do what I did and get yourself all worked up for greek fries and be disappointed when you show up on a Monday and walk away greek-fry-less.

Mmm...Chicken and Pine Nut salad and a glass of wine. Heaven.  Sauce is such a cool hangout. They offer the best pizzas and pasta (and salad!) that you will ever have in your life! This location in Dana Park is fantastic, but it is super busy (a testament to the great food, mind you).  If you haven't been here, you need to get here.

Holy homemade tortillas. Get in my belly!  This is a great fast casual mexican place that is mucho flavorful and at a great price! My favorite thing (aside from the freaking amazing tortillas) are the enchiladas. I try to always get one mild and one medium so I can have a good mix of green and red.   Here's a tip, if you want the crew to sing you a a little song, order the nachos!  They also cater, I have used them for past office meetings and they are very affordable and deliver right on time!

I have yet to meet anyone who says "I absolutely love going to the dentist!". It's one of those things you have to do...but with Dr. Sick, you may find that you actually enjoy your dental visits.  To start, the staff is incredibly nice. Every. Single. One. Seriously, they are the sweetest, most well informed staff you will ever come across.  When you arrive and get settled, they offer you a paraffin wax hand treatment to get you nice and relaxed. It's a really nice touch.  The office is very up to date on all the best dental equipment and the clinic is spotless.  Dr. Sick knows just about everything there is to know about dentistry and also happens to be one of the nicest people you'll ever meet. There is no fear of the dentist with him! He answers questions carefully and kindly and keeps you well informed during every dental procedure so there are no surprises.  If you are looking for a dentist, don't hesitate to call and make an appointment. You can thank me later. :)

I've driven by this place probably a thousand times and always thought to myself, "self, you should go check that place out". Well, friends, I am happy to say, the day has finally arrived.  Why, oh why, did I wait to stinkin' long to get here?? This place is amazing!!! The food is flavorful, generously portioned and the staff treats you like family. Oompah!!  Here's a little tip for all of you hungry greek loving people out there, get the meat lovers platter. But, now trust me on this, you can half the size you order. For example, a platter for two will feed four very hungry,  large men, and still leave you will a take out box to go. As the menu description aptly proclaims, the meat lovers platter is a SYMPOSIUM OF ECSTASY.   If you are like me, and keep saying to yourself "I should check that place out", learn from my mistake and get your booty there asap.

Mmmm....grilled vegetable scramble. Do it.  Joe's is amazing. And they are always busy, so if you decide to come in, plan on standing in line for a bit, but rest assured, every minute is worth the delectable tastes that you will encounter on your first bite.  They also have pancakes that are light, fluffy and YUM. If you are considering visiting here, consider no more and get your booty in for some breakfast!

This is one of my favorite hang outs in Gilbert. The coffee is tasty, the atmosphere is relaxing, the cupcakes are deliciousness...and the food is surprisingly yummy and filling.   Here's a little tip, they service quiche, breakfast burritos, oatmeal, etc etc. So, when the line is long at Joe's, don't fret, walk right over to The Coffee Shop and order up in no time. The staff is really helpful and they offer TONS (did I say tons? I meant it) of non coffee drinks for you silly caffeine abstainers. The lemonade is tart and sweet and so right.

Here's a fabulous tip: they serve breakfast ALL DAY on Sundays. Yes, you saw that right, alllll day.   Boyfriend got the papas grandes burrito and I got the waffle with fresh cream and berries...and here we have discovered the miraculous and satisfying pleasure of getting to half both savory and sweet. Perfection.   Also, try a monsoon. With almond milk if you dare. Seriously the creamiest, tastiest coffee confection you'll ever try.   The atmosphere is casual and cozy and everything you could possibly order is wonderful. You can't go wrong here folks!

As my profile so aptly states, you can usually find me in a coffee shop or in a consignment store. I love Name Brand Exchange. They have really great prices on a lot of really great name brands. The customer service is...adequate. They don't harass you a lot and ask if they can help you find something (thank GOD!), but they are also really friendly when you do have a question about just about anything.  The only reason I don;t give NBE a 5 star review is because the place is really cluttered...I hate bumping into other people or getting my purse strap stuck on a wayward hanger from a rack I'm walking by.

Mmmm...artichoke and avocado enchiladas are a veggie-saur dream come true! Delicious and then some.  The atmosphere is nice in here, and it's definitely a busy place because of San Tan being such a hot spot for shopping, but the service is really pretty great.  The drinks are somewhat pricey (thus only 4 stars instead of 5), so realistically, this isn't a place you want to come for more than one drink unless you plan to have a large bill at the end of the meal.

I seriously love coming into TSC. They make that other place (jamba juice) hang their head in shame. When I lived in Colorado and there were no TSC's in the area, I ALWAYS tried to replicate the Blimey Limey somehow at JJ and they could never make it just right.  They also offer incredible wraps and sandwiches and great meal deals so that you get a smoothie with it! The prices are great and everyone is very friendly and helpful.

What a cute place! We came in here for dinner and were pleasantly surprised! This is a definite family feeling environment, the service was really friendly and welcoming. We had told the hostess (who I think is part owner) that it was our first time and she came over a few times throughout our dinner to ask how everything was and offer suggestions. She also provided us with free drinks on the house to end our superb meal.  The Balsamic Chicken is AMAZING and the Pear Salad was a little piece of fresh heaven. Great combination of flavors and dressing.  You will definitely enjoy a visit here...slightly overpriced, but the service and environment make up for all of that!

LOVE me some Someburros!! Where else can you get an AMAZING, fresh, tasty, filling breakfast burro (burrito) at all hours of the day? Someburros I say!  I am always greeted by a friendly face and smile when I arrive at Someburros and they are always super helpful when it comes to making menu selections. Did I mention the breakfast burros yet?? SO GOOD.  Also, they have some of the best green chile tamales I have had anywhere (and they sell them by the dozen!!), the cheese enchiladas are the perfect blend of red chile sauce and yummy cheesy corn tortilla goodness. The beans and rice are fantastic...and the breakfast burros...GET ONE! For real!  Love this place, the drive thru is convenient for phone or online orders and makes getting in and out with your Someburro loot even easier.

Stop yourself right now. Walk away quickly.  Man, I have NEVER said that about a restaurant anywhere before. Like for the reals. Usually I can find one good thing to say about any place I go to, but this is the exception to the rule.  The interior of this place looks like an old Chili's...does anyone know if it used to be? The decor is failing and everything on the walls looked extremely dusty. It is run down in appearance and that was my first red flag.  We waited at our table for a good 7-8 minutes before we were even approached for a drink order and even then, we were told that he would be right back to get our drink order. Did I mention the place was not busy? There had to have been a max of three other tables that were seated.  We then waited 25 minutes for our food to be delivered once we were able to order...not sure what was going on there...but when the food arrived, I knew immediately that I was going to be in for a long night of bathroom runs if we stayed. I ordered a combo plate with a mini bean burrito and a cheese enchilada. My boyfriend had a chile relleno.  I choked down a few bites of rice and beans because the enchilada was out of the question after I precariously tried a morsel of it.  Then after very clearly pushing our plates to the edge of the table to signify we were done, ten minutes passes. Our server didn't even deliver our food and never stopped by to make sure everything was ok. I finally had to flag down a busser and ask if he could send over our server so we can pay. Another server came over and took our credit card for us and we were able to pay and get the heck outta there.  Will not be back and no amount of coercing or bribery would work. As feared, the bathroom and I became fast friends after this meal.

I have a nine pound cute little furry black and brown pup who absolutely HATES going to the groomers. Lucky for her she's got short hair so she only gets subjected to this every few weeks for a nail trim. I learned long ago that it was way too scary for me to trim them myself, so the wonderfully sweet girls at petsmart take good care of her for me.  $9 for a nail trim or $11 for the grinder which is a pretty great deal. You can also walk in and they will do it while you shop. Bonus.  Every staff member here is friendly and very obviously loves animals.

Imagine if you will, a world where everyone is friendly and uber smart and basically gives you what you want. That world is called Best Deal in Town.   We came in recently looking to purchase another TV (got the last one from BDIT as well) and were greeted immediately by Jordan (hey Jordan!). He walked us through the store and explained everything about HD, Smart TV, Non Smart Tv, LDC, LED, Plasma, etc. I know NOTHING about such things, so it is beyond helpful to have someone like Jordan to help navigate the process and keep my brain from exploding.  We got a great deal (seriously, they do have the best deals in town) and left happy with our choice of TV.  They also have DVD and Bluray players and mounts as well as laptops, etc etc. Anything you could possibly need electonically, they've got it!

Thanks to Yelp I found SunDust and the hot boyfriend and I went in to make a couple of pictures for my kitchen.  The cool thing about SunDust is that you can literally walk in at anytime before 6pm and paint to your hearts content. The prices are not bad considering that everything is provided for you.  Peggy, the owner is very nice and helpful, but doesn't hover, which I appreciate. We will be back again soon!

As far as casinos run in Phoenix, this is probably the best one. Maybe because it's also the newest, but still, if you are looking for the Vegas feel without being in Vegas, the Talking Stick is for you. It reminds me a lot of The Palms or The Rio. It's clean (minus the smoke smell everywhere, but whattaya gonna do about that in a casino??) and there's tons of tables, so you don;t have to spend too much time searching for an open place to play blackjack.

Nobody likes a flat tire. Especially bright and early in the morning when you're running late for work.   A screw was the culprit in my case (it's like I have magnets on my tires, this happens to me all the time) and I had the sneaking feeling it would be irreparable prior to stopping into Discount, but a girl can hope differently, right?  I parked and was just a few steps away from my car when I was greeted by Jean Luc. He was friendly and smiling and immediately put me at ease. He got me all set within just a few minutes (even though the store was fairly busy).   As it turns out, I did need a new tire and had one on in about 15-20 minutes and I was on my way. Fantastic service and my tire didn't even cost me an arm and a leg. I left happy and glad to be on my way so quickly.  Highly recommend this location!!  Oh, but P.S. to Discount, it would be nice to have wifi available for customers while they wait. :)

Holy yogurt!! This place has a lot of froyo options to choose from...but if I may offer a suggestion, the cake batter is the absolute BEST. I made the mistake of getting something other than that the first time I visited here...and it was a sad sad day in yogurt heaven for me. Trust me, stick with the cake batter.  The only (and yes, really the ONLY) thing I would add to this place is a larger selection of toppings. They have a lot of candy options, but I prefer nuts and fruit and somewhat healthier options. I have to balance it all out, you know?   This is a pay by the ounce kind of do it yourself froyo, so careful with the heavier toppings. Definitely worth checking out.  Let me say it one last time. Cake Batter. Get it.

I want to like this place. I really do. It's in a great location, there's plenty of outdoor seating...but...I just didn't like it. The food was ok. The service was...ok... Maybe a 2.5 star overall, but not a 3.  We ordered the Bruschetta Flatbread and the Pesto Chicken. Both of which weren't bad, but nothing extra special. The broccoli tasted a little fishy to me (and I don;t mean weird, I mean "fishy"), like they cooked it in the same water they cleaned the cod out in.   The service was ok, our server wasn't overly friendly and when we asked him for ideas or suggestions since it was our first time, all we got was a "um yeah, everything is good here".   Also, the food is a little pricey for what it is.  Overall, it was ok if you are in a pinch or if the line at Costa Vida next door is too long (which is why we went in).

Wow. The annihilator is INCREDIBLE. It's like drinking caffeine flavored bliss with all the sugar you can handle. It makes the caramel macchiato at Starbucks taste like dirty mush. For real.   The service is lightning fast and the hopped up, happy baristas are really friendly, without seeming overbearing. If you haven't checked it out, you definitely need to. Delicious drops of heaven await you, just around the drive thru.  Seriously, who the heck is Starbucks???

I have driven by here a few times and on a recent occasion I was looking for a quick and easy place to stop and get a bite and do a little bit of leasing paperwork.   Holly's has a nice comfortable, homey feel to it. I think I met Holly herself when I ordered and she was absolutely sweet and helped me pick out something to order...but listen anytime the phrase "breakfast burritos served all day here" I am sold.  My burrito was super flavorful and packed with green chiles. Definitely will be back for more deliciousness from Holly's, because some of those baked goods looked like manna from heaven!

I am an over the top froyo lover. I would eat it everyday if I could.  I have been to TasteBuds twice in the last week and have been impressed with the friendliness of the staff on both occasions.They are helpful and knowledgeable about the the yogurt and keep the topping bar looking clean and stocked.  My only complaint is the low number of no sugar added options. I think strawberry sorbet was the only flavor that was offered on my last two visits...and while it was tasty...it wasn't what I was in the mood for.  Aside from that, love the location and will definitely be back in the future!

Wow. I cannot begin to tell you how much Urgent Care Extra has come through for me.  After moving to AZ, I got hit with a MAJOR case of allergies. No exaggeration, I had never ever been that sick in my life with any kind of illness as I was with these allergies. I seriously thought this was the end.  I was greeted immediately upon walking in and after a few sheets of paperwork, I was on my way back to see the provider. They got me all fixed up and within a couple of days of using the medication prescribed, I was on the road to recovery.  $50 gets you in to see a doctor and $15 will cover each prescription if necessary. This is a GREAT deal especially if you don;t have insurance coverage. (fyi, use the yelp check in offer for a free prescription to save a few extra bucks).  I would highly recommend this location if you are in need of immediate medical assistance.

Love this cute little place! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so any place that caters to my love for eggs and waffles makes my heart happy. I liked this place so much that I went twice during a five day trip to Phoenix.  The service here is beyond friendly. They are so welcoming from the moment you walk in the door and from what I saw, they know all the regulars and even remember their orders. I love that! It feels like you are being welcomed by good friends or family. I definitely recommend the chorizo and the spinach and chicken omelette.

I have been wanting to come here for ages! Ok, well, maybe only since i moved back to Phoenix a month ago...but still...in hungry foodie days, a month is FOREVER.  The vibe is cool and trendy and Johnny Anonymous was playing the night we visited...love them!   So first off, I have to say, only two vegetarian options..UGH. Usually mexican places are an easy feat for me when it comes to finding delicious no added meat items. Not so much here...your choices are Vegetable enchiladas with zucchini, squash, sweet potatoes and mushrooms or nachos. Let me say that as a very white looking mexican, I know that sweet zucchini and squash do not go with anything mexican food related. Where the heck is the green chile and beans?  I ordered the Todo Santos Nachos. They were...ok. Not a lot of flavor, but luckily my super hot boyfriend had some tasty queso dip that I added to my mini tostada nachos to liven them up a little.  We also ordered guacamole for the table, which was, eh. The guy who mashes the avocados must have stormed out and quit during his shift, because it was basically halved avos served with a few tomatoes and feta on a sad looking lettuce leaf. Luckily, I am a guac expert, so I mashed those right up with my fork and added some salt pronto which helped us to at least be able to scoop them up with our chips.  I am willing to give TQLA another shot because I am a sucker for brunch, and they offer Sunday brunch, so I will be headed there on a not so distant Sunday. Stay tuned my pretties.

Oh, DB, you make all other coffee houses seem bland and boring and uninteresting.  Seriously, their employees are like a four year old on a sugar high. They are always super excited to see you and ask about your day/weekend/life/brother/cousin/friend/car/hair. Seriously.  My recommendation? An iced annihilator. Do it. You will love it. And if for some crazy looney bin reason you don't, I'm sure they would jump right up (quite literally) and make you something else your little taste buds would love.  Do it. Go to DB. Tell them about your weekend at the pool and get an annihilator.  You're welcome.

This is a cute little breakfast/lunch spot if you are looking for something low key and where you don't have to wait for extended periods of time just to get served a cup of joe.  I tried the strawberries and cream waffle, and it was great! The strawberries were fresh, the cream was not. Slight disappointment there, but I got over it pretty quickly when I tasted my over easy ice. It was an iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk. And let me tell you, sweetened condensed milk makes everything taste amazing!! They add a hint of mint, cinnamon and cardamom to it, which sounds a little crazy, but it's really quite refreshing.  The prices are really comparable and the service was really friendly. Definitely will be back.

Chop chop, get your self to the chop shop!  The protein plates are so so good here. I ordered the tofu with quinoa which comes with broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots and onions. My only complaint (and it may just be personal) is that they use silken tofu. Not a fan...it can taste a little like a non cooked egg white to me. No bueno. I prefer my tofu as firm as Jillian Michaels' booty.  Overall, a great place to catch a healthy organic meal, but a tip: order ahead and pick it up because the line is LONG.

So....this place is in no way terrible...but also in no way is it great.  The pluses: * The "mini" sized milkshake is the size of a bucket. I was anticipating a DQ sized mini blizzard. Not so my fellow ice cream lovers. You will NEED to share this with someone. Or face the consequences of gaining 12 pounds instantly. * Service was friendly. * They offer sweet potato fries.  The minuses: * No vegetarian option. C'mon...no veggie burger?? They offer a kids grilled cheese. * The young man who took our order was...well, young and got distracted easily and confused about the menu items, which thoroughly confused me when ordering. * The restaurant was not well kept. The dining area looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in a day. We ended up lightly cleaning our own table before sitting down. * The bathrooms...well...not clean. Waste of washing my hands.  Probably won't be back personally, but if the cons were rectified, could be an ok place for the High School crowd.

Ok, seriously why did no one think of this spectacular idea before? Healthy, reasonably priced salad drive thru. Oh and not to be forgotten, AMAZING breakfast.   My obsession with Salad and Go started in a cool morning with a warm berry quinoa bowl. So feeling good! It'll make you forget you ever had any desire for oatmeal in your past life.   Then I tried a caprese salad and the obsession grew. It's a HUGE salad (seriously three meals worth for me) bursting with pesto and balsamic. And for a little over $5?? Sold.   Then, addiction set in with a breakfast bowl. Anytime someone wants to give me red potatoes, pico de gallo and avocado for breakfast, I am totally in...at first I thought it was odd that's it's really more of a salad breakfast bowl (ie: the tons of fresh spinach leaves they serve up for you for breakfast) but holy breakfast...mix that in with some egg whites and I am SOLD for life on this.   Oh...and the iced coffee? Yum. I am such a coffee snob and I love theirs.   Everyone is super friendly and they even have organic dog bones for the furry kids if you bring them along for the ride.   Grab a salad and go at your next available opportunity, you will thank me (and them).

Why oh why do they offer so many good shows here? This place is a nightmare!  First off, the parking is atrocious. Get here like an hour early if you want to avoid the rip-your-hair-out-run-people-over-cuss-a-lot frustration that comes with the freakishly long line of cars that starts a mile before you even get to Ak-Chin. There's got to be a better system for this.  Second...we saw a girl squat down and pee (yes, really) just outside of the pavilion. I don't think we are in Kansas anymore folks...it was disgusting to say the very least...not sure why no one stopped her.  The show itself was great and the weather cooperated fairly well...the seats a re a little close together, which can make for an awkward nice-to-meet-you-sorry-I-brushed-your-arm for the 25th time moment.  The food is a rip off, much like any concert venue. $4.50 for a bottle of water, $9+ for anything alcoholic and at least $8-12 for any type of snack.  We left during the band's last song and before the encore because I could foresee another I-want-to-slit-my-wrists getting out of the parking lot moment. I think we will be staying far away from Ak-Chin as much as possible unless there is a must see concert there.

It all started with a search for pho in the east valley...which led me to Simi's Cafe and the fantastic reviews it has earned.  I must say, the stars are a great indicator of how fantastic this place is! A friend of mine and I went in for dinner on Wednesday and WOW. The place is so cozy and trendy inside. I love the red velvet touches! The sweet lady who waited on us was so helpful in answering questions about the menu and checked on us regularly and made us feel right at home.  Now...to the food...so so good. I had vegetable fried rice with crispy tofu which was  so packed full of veggies, snap peas, carrots, mushrooms and broccoli to name a few. The flavor was incredible and our server recommended adding some hot sauce to it in the future, which I WILL be doing.  My friend had the green curry chicken, which I stole a few bites of...and wow, the perfect combination of spicy and sweet with just a hint of lemongrass.  Very great experience and we will back back!

Hallelujah, Snooze has come to Phoenix!!!!  As a Denver native, I can only hope to describe to you non-Denverites the culture of Snooze. It has made all other breakfast places seem dismal. The quality of food is astounding, the atmosphere is upbeat and trendy and the servers are the friendliest, hippest people you will ever meet. You will never wait less tan an hour for a table, but the wait has always been worth it.  Snooze Phoenix is no different. They have captured the essence of the hipster vibe of Denver and brought it to the valley quite nicely.  The food, again will never disappoint. If you've never been, here are my suggestions:  Always ask what the pancake of the day is. Always.  Sweet: Pancake Flight with a Pineapple Upside Down Pancake, the Pancake of the Day and a Cinnamon Roll pancake.  Savory: 3 Egg Scramble with hollandaise, avocado and pico de gallo and corn tortillas.  There is nothing but love in my heart for Snooze. Now, Snooze, please get your booties out to Orange County next!!!

We came here CInco de Mayo weekend and this place was rockin! We ended up eating indoors, away from the festivities because we were looking for a quieter dining experience and let me tell you, the food, service and atmosphere are great!  They have well over 100 different kinds of tequila and a margarita flight where you can try four of your choice, which is actually a great deal.  Here's a tip, get the enchiladas done Christmas style. They mix the red and green chile so you don;t have to pick just one! Your taste buds will thank you (and me!).

The $5 hot and ready we grabbed for a quick dinner was lacking in sauce (literally none on it at all)...but did come with an added bonus of matted long black hair baked into the bottom of our crust.   Yeah...seriously...feeling multiple strands of hair literally ripping in my mouth when I take a bite is about as disgusting as I've ever experienced.   This is the last time we will ever visit this location...and probably the last time I'll have pizza for a while. Appetite ruined.

First things first...don't try to use the yelp check-in offer here. It will be awkward when you happily show them your phone and then get rejected in front of a long of people.   Yeah. AAAAAWKWARD.  Just don't do it. They don't honor it anymore. Someone at yogurtland needs to get that removed from the yelp system to avoid further embarrassing the yelpers.  Here's the thing, I typically LOVE me some yogurtland. I would stop in everyday if I thought I could get away with it.  This location is a tad messy...which sucks because it's so conveniently located to me and is housed at at Dana Park which is an awesome shopping center. This location is messy, the staff isn't overly friendly (I feel like I'm not allowed to have sample cups for example) and I'm ready for new yogurt flavors already! They rarely have any good no sugar added flavors.

LOVE this place! I had never been into a which wich before so an employee came out and explained the entire process to me.  You pick what kind of sandwich you want, get the corresponding paper bag, then mark off all the ingredients and sauces you want with a provided marker and take it up to the counter to pay for it.   They have fantastic options for toppings and sauces and it takes the guesswork out of building a sandwich. No longer do you have to say, no mushrooms, no onions, add avocado, etc etc.   Your sandwich, your way.  Great flavor and high quality products. Here's a tip, pick the skinny sandwich bread and they take some of the bread out of the middle to save you about 80 calories and make more room for more toppings!

I wish this wasn't the closest sonic to my house, because I get a craving for cranberry limeades on a regular basis...and unfortunately, a trip to this location is NEVER under 15 minutes. It doesn't matter if you use the drive thru or the drive in option...the wait is always horrendously long. I've even tried going in a different times of the day, hoping for a change, but it is to no avail.  On a good note, they do make the limeades well...must be what's taking so long! :)

I love me some froyo, yo!   I am a happy little camper to to see a Menchie's in Gilbertland because I am huge fan of their high quality yogurt (tons of selections) and tasty little toppings.  I am also big on choosing the no sugar added froyo because I am a freak about my sugar intake and milk has enough on its own. Menchie's had two perfectly suited NSA froyo on this particular evening, German Chocolate and Iced Coffee. Froyo HEAVEN!  The girl who was working was uber nice and friendly and always told every customer to have a smiley day, which I thought was really cute and different.

Mmmmm...quinoa tacos are freaking awwwwwwesome!!!  I met a friend for lunch, he had been, I had not. I always scope out the yelp reviews before coming, because as a veggiesaur I like to know if I have options or if I should pregame it prior to coming to I'm not starving.  I had a bit of an inward struggle trying to decide between the seasonal vegetarian salad and the medallion quinoa tacos and SO glad I went with the tacos. They are a little small, so if you have a huge appetite, I would recommend getting a side to go with, but for me they were perfectly sized and delish. Great flavor and mix of crunchy/soft ingredients.  The atmosphere is super cool as well, I am loving the walls in here!!  Oh and a small tip if I may, make a reservation on open table prior to your visit to ensure ultra fast seating during the lunch hour. :)  I will be back for brunch in my near future because I saw many great mouthwatering pictures on good ole yelp that are making my stomach growl!

Mmmm...chipotle black bean burger...GET IN MY BELLY.  Pita Jungle is one of those places that you just feel cool eating at. It has a hipster, artsy vibe to it and everyone is over the top nice.   As stated so slyly above, my fav is the chipotle black bean burger. I get mine with no bun, because I am not about to let bread fill me up when there's a tasty little dish like this one on the table (they have cranberries inside of the burger!!!). It comes with a side of chipotle hummus and garlic new potatoes, which are so flavorful and good.  Second fav is the falafel pita. What's a falafel you ask? Well, it;s heaven in a round crispy garbanzo bean package. If you have never had one, just try it. You will like it.

This place has been on my list for a few weeks because as a vegetarian, I am a sucker for natural, organic places.  I wish I could say that I loved this place. I really do. I wanted to. I tried.   *sigh* Didn't happen.   Pros: * The decor is cool and new. * They have the cool drink station with tons of beverage options.  Cons: * The vegetarian offerings are slim unless you want to eat a ton of cheesy, simple white carbs as the options are either served on white bread or are a pasta. * The food was very oily, which is not something i expect from a place that promotes healthy, clean food. * They are pricey and the servings are small. * NO nutrition info available anywhere. I like to know how much fat, sugar, calories are in my meals. * The staff was not knowledgeable about the menu. When asking questions, we were either told that they didn't know or they simply read to us off the menu.  Seriously bummed out because I was so excited about trying this place and most Gilbert residents will agree that we need some good healthy options on the east side.

Denver based companies have risen in the valley again!!  Seriously, LOVE me some TJ's.They offer great, healthy options (for real though, check out the nutrition facts on the website) and best of all, it's veggie-saur paradise, complete with rice, all the veggies you can fit into a bowl and even tofu. And the good kind of firm tofu.  If you haven't been in yet, get your booty in here...te service is FAST and friendly. Oh and they even offer freshly made sushi right before your very eyes if you're into that sort of thing.  And, bonus, they have four types of freshly brewed tea!  See you at TJ's!

This has got to be my favorite place to get breakfast at Sky Harbor. I literally walked all the way from a C Gate to get here and have a breakfast burrito before my last flight.  I get an egg and cheese burrito and add avocado, for 50 cents, it is SO worth the extra cost. The eggs are seasoned well, the pico del gallo is fresh and the papas (potatoes) are so tasty!! It's an amazing combination.  The past three visits to Los Taquitos, the same girl has been working the register and she is the nicest. She offers a lot of suggestions to travelers who have no clue what to get and is so friendly to everyone.  Highly recommend for a breakfast that will leave you full and happy for your next morning flight :)

Let me just admit something right off the bat. I ate SO much on my most recent visit here that I am almost (yes, almost) ashamed of myself. But when the food is this good, you can't stop yourself!!  The house potato chips with onion dip....OMG, get in my belly! So flavorful and crispy! Then, let's have a little chat about the soft pretzels and provolone fondue...I may or may not have eaten almost an entire basket by myself!!  Ok, and then here's my major confession: I am a veggie-saur, but pregnancy cravings have me devouring a juicy burger from time to time and this my friends was one of those times. The pub burger was incredible! Juicy and bursting with flavor! I could only fit half of it in my stomach after the little incident with the house chips and pretzel bites.  The service was amazing and the decor is gorgeous! They will even give you a tour of the restaurant at any time during your meal. What a great place to hang with friends, co-workers or your special someone.   The house potato chips, did I mention those yet?? Get them!!

Let me make this very very clear:  This is the BEST food you will ever have in your life.  Ok, now that we have that established...let me take some time to convince you as to why.  The Pineapple upside down pancakes are so good that every other pancake for the rest of your life will be dry and tasteless in comparison. Unless of course you can convince the chef to make you coffee and donut pancakes. Also FREAKING amazing.  The sandwich I am, three egg scramble, upstream benny (or ANY of the benny's for that matter) are slap yo mama good.  Oh and the best part? A Colorado based company!! When I moved from Denver a couple of years ago, I was devestated (no, but really, I was) that I wouldn't get to make my regular weekend stop into Snooze. And lo and behold, they came to Arizona! This is the second location in the valley. The other location is off of 20th and Camelback.  Just a side note, the wait times can be a little long, but I GUARANTEE that every minute is worth it when you take your first bite. Guarantee it.

OMG. I may gain an additional 50 pounds thanks to Kneaders.  My weakness is bread. Always has been...and kneaders is baking up a TON of fresh bread on the regular, nearly every type you can imagine, PLUS the dessert case is brimming with the best brownies, bread pudding, cake and pie that you have ever had.  Their sandwiches are huge, so if you order one, plan on sharing or having half of it to take home. And believe me, you will want to save room for pineapple cake, a cinnamon roll or brownies. BELIEVE ME.  They also server all you can eat french toast on the weekends. You are speaking my love language Kneaders!!! And why is is the best, melt in your mouth, gooey, cinnamony french toast ever?  Watch. 50 pounds are coming at me. UGH.
