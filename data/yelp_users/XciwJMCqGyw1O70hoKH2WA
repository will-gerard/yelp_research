Everyone and their mothers visited DBG while Chihully was in season, and I myself attended 12 times... And even as it warmed up and the exhibit was removed, I still found the enjoyment and peace of the desert tours early morning or late evening to beat the heat. Will always love this Arizona Gem. A great place to take out of towners when they visit. Remember... Our backyard cacti and wildlife is alien to these friends & family... DBG fascinates even the most boring uncle that never wants to do anything.... :)

I have held off writing a review for Moto for a year or so.  Sadly I have been subject to dining here multiple times, because I am sucker for 'second chances...and third and fourth'...  Moto joined the North Central scene years ago, and sadly has gone down hill.  The only thing helping it stay afloat is the lack of other sushi restaurants in the area for the citizens of the neighborhood to enjoy.    The service is pitiful, and it seems like they hire anyone that inquires.  Dining at Moto takes over an hour and a half, with just 3 people.  Getting water upon arrival is painful and receiving the exact food you ordered, is not an option.   Whatever you do...don't come to dine if you have any food allergy.   The bartenders are always eating and licking their fingers, touching their hair and then touching everything "sanitary" behind the bar.  The drinks made and ready to go to their respectful customers, just sit at the bar back and begin to water down for easily 10 mins before the floor server magically reappears from the kitchen.  The food isnt even good!  Sushi is sloppy, not creative, and poor cuts of fish.    The ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI...well, they bank on their horrible service to never bring you the goods as you request and are ready.  We sat in front of empty plates for 35 mins at one point.  Twice now, when we were ready to leave, the server is no where to be found (just the same as most of the meal).  I was literally trying to give them money and they would avoid all eye contact and assistance. *que bad SNL skit from the 80s....   Please, do yourself a favor, and do not dine here....and WHATEVER you do...dont take anyone here for dinner, you will embarrass yourself.

Be very specific up front if you need the interior glass cleaned and dashboard dusted. I've unfortunately driven away and not had a decent clean inside of the car.  Nice staff and hard workers! Be sure to tip the guys up front vacuuming and not just on the tail end... Think about it: which do you think is harder !? lol

The best advisors ! Helpful and genuine. They will tell you what you need to know, even if it doesn't gain them any business! They sell and repair vacuums and accessories.

We love the Village!  We only like children, however.  The summer months bring in all of the younglings to play, so whether you're walking across the gym, in the locker room or to the pool... there will be half pints darting around you.  Summon all of your patience to bare through your workout.  The facilities are always clean and the staff is polite and professional.  This place is definitely worth the high monthly membership fees.

Love!  We have now lived here for 4 months and I can confidently say that I am so excited to resign our lease next year!  I have never re-signed a lease with an rental, admittedly because I do have extremely high standards.  This community is not hundreds of units for a management team to run... There is just the perfect number of residents and nothing goes unnoticed. Hard wood floors, stainless steel appliances, tall green trees surrounding the entire property.  Once a citrus orchard, the spring climate gives the whole area an amazing perfume! Arcadia is the place to live! Central to everything...bike anywhere, and easy access to other city neighborhoods. 1, 2 & 3 Bedroom Units.  Mostly adult professionals who live here.  Not many families with children, which make for a quiet atmosphere.

By far the best Airport in the country. Large enough that you never feel trampled... Clean facilities and smart staff... And the FOOD! This place has a top notch list of non corporate, local favorites!  Say goodbye to the reheated airport pizzas and kitschy convenient store snack foods. You'll be delighted to spend time here before your flight and possibly even when you land... Taking a few extra mins to unwind and freshen up with a delicious plate of food or craft drink

Terrible service, but i suppose you cannot expect much from the hired 17year old girls. Walked in and went to the register to ask a question. The 3 girls stood there chatting with each other for a good amount of time, while I stood waiting and trying to make eye contact. I finally just interrupted the in-depth conversation about failing their driving tests. My question was sincere and it was answered with a terrible attitude. I did not end up doing business here... After all, wouldn't want to bother the staff with the task of doing their job.

I dont know why oh why I keep returning to the scene of the crime!?  I am constantly disappointed with the food quality.  The fries are always over cooked, toasted, hard and inedible at this location. Why only THIS ino ??  the burgers are sloppy and not stacked correctly.  I'd rather just go to Five Guys right across the street.  ugh.

The SLOWEST Einstein staff ever! Full of excuses... Every time we come they apparently are down a toaster or multiple staff members. I just want my ONE bagel... I don't even get it toasted, and yet... 16 mins after we order... I'm still standing here waiting for the food I just paid for. uggggh

I want to say this place has changed, but sadly it has not... Still just a handful of tacky chain restaurants and cheap imitation clothing stores. Unattended children running around and hordes of culture-less Scottsdale families who are probably too scared to go anywhere non-cookie cut commercial.  Music playing throughout is nerve grading Nickleback and Chris Daughtry. A little nauseating. There is so much potential for boutique, unique and clever eateries/shops... But I guess if nothing has changed in the past dozen years... It probably never will. Ugh.

The absolute nicest, most patient staff!  Reasonable prices and all of the help you need. They will put you at ease as you hand over your beloved computer... They will probably call you same day with a check in as to what the initial diagnostic is. They even called us once just a few hours later to say that they wanted to be honest, and that they couldn't get to my order that day... I was so happy to hear from them but told them I was fine with the 4 day quote time ! It was nice of them to care about exceeding any initial service expectations! Although I hope I never have another problem with my computer ... I will still return for tech products they have.  Chargers, covers, cables, keyboards, office bags etc.

I am so happy that America's has found such great success!  Simple Mission accomplished: Amazing food.   Love me some Bean & Cheese burrito. (tip: ask for it Terry's style...they add raw white onion and hot sauce).  Their vampiros are delicious of course....but the show stopper is the Carne Asada Torta.  As a native arizonan...I am assuring you, this is the best.    They offer a free Chips & Trio if you sign up for their loyalty club...and don't forget to follow them on Facebook!  it's always nice to have a reminder when their happy hours are, half of taco days and $2 coronas ! :)

I have so many wonderful feelings, and delicious experiences at el choreographed. So much that we are actually planning our wedding here ! From their sticky buns to jalepeno polenta, melt in your mouth short rib and buttery goodness lamb... Your experience will be outstanding every time.

This neighborhood treasure is something you must seek out, even if you're not already in the neighborhood!  Please, whatever you do...start your meal with their Root Beer Float!  Straight from the tap with perfectly smooth vanilla ice cream.   This place gets creative with each one of their burgers.  Salads, Sandwiches, Steak and even Meat loaf!   BeWare -- you must order your starchy goodness extra, as the entree's do not come with Fries, Tots or Rings.  I must tell you however, their Onion rings are perfectly tempura'd.  So Good!  Open late for those unexpected cravings after sun down :)   Mosey on down to Arcadia for the evening and enjoy this perfect lunch or dinner spot waiting for you!

The usual kind of so-so helpful staff. I can imagine they are extremely overwhelmed all of the time. The store was in horrible disarray and it seems they were choosing Saturday at 1pm as a great time to restock ?? Too much craziness.  They do have 15% discount for students or teachers... So that's nice :)

This urgent care facility is by far the best that I've ever been to!! it's sad to call myself an expert, but I have been to dozens of urgent healthcares around the country and here, the healthcare administrative staff is very knowledgeable, kind and patient. The waiting area is clean and organized -- the wait time has never been too excessive and in fact, if it is too long they let me know that they will call within 20 minutes of my appointment and I can come back another time.  we went in once when it was absolutely urgent, and they brought us right back even though there may have been a small wait. I really appreciated that they were able to evaluate our urgency over someone who just needed a simple consultation. The provider was nice and followed up with me personally -- the medical assistant and certified nurse assistant were very diligent.  I really appreciated that this facility had x-ray on property and I didn't have to wait, or go to a different place to get x-rays completed. the paperwork was timely and organized. I was able to provide the company paying for my out-of-pocket expenses, all of the necessary work because the administrator was so diligent in following up with me. I recommend people going to this urgent care even if it's not the closest to their home.  to boot, there is a fresh and easy 24 hours right next-door for any of the Gatorade and foods that you might need for your ailments!

Love this place :) great service, amazing staff, high end experience all around. Be sure to make an appointment ahead of time. Newbies get a free eyebrow wax and if you recommend someone, you'll get $10.00 credit when then come in :)

The real deal !  A speak easy in every way... There's not even any signage ;) once you find this Arizona gem you will understand, as the initiation for this place is just that. An initiation. So only bring your favorite friends to enjoy their wood lined cabin bar, skee ball, foose ball and dart games. The hand crafted and muddled drinks are amaze and the bites delicious. My favorites are the Arizona Mule and the Beeting.  Go. Go now!  P.s don't forget to sign and doodle in the guest books at be bar :)

Love my neighborhood Starbucks staff, however...Parking lot is tricky and does not wrap all of the way around. I see traffic jams as people make 23 point turn around a to exit. They really need signage !!! Management can easily step up here !

This area of paradise valley had prayers answered when this DB went in !  Love the product and service!  They will even create custom drinks for you if you're feeling adventurous and need a creative barista to match your spirit animal.  Recently, I was given a "white walker-iced-something-delicious" to enjoy while watching the Game of Thrones season finale. They get me. The Brothers le Dutch get me.

We have been regulars to the Sow since they opened their Phoenix restaurant.  This menu is for the adventurous and the hungry! Love the fried avocado with pulled BBQ pork and spicy fresca drizzled over the top. Smoked salmon toasts have a charred twist and pickled extras.  Their crispy chicken is perfect every time and their smashed roasted fingerlings are beautifully soft and crisp with bone marrow gravy smothering them to death.  Get excited for the giant pot that arrives to your table for the short rib entree. This dish is served cowboy style in a giant pot, with all of the cookout fixings... Carrots, potatoes and onion with the fried egg perched on top!  Whatever you do... Don't say no to dessert!    The cocktails are trendy, manly and refreshing... All of the local brews you love and some new ones that the bartenders can passionately introduce to you !  The Sow also has a free membership card to rack up the points and ensure your loyalty!

We have just died and found our new favorite, heavenly hamburger joint.  Their standard burger is picture perfect and even more perfectly delicious. Stand sauce is the bomb. Their French fries are magnificent... And they make them in house of course :) if you're lucky and the heavens are Smiling down on you... you'll find a potato end that is fried up like a golden nugget in the mix. You can't help but smile while you eat!  The staff is so incredibly cheerful and pleasant... Making sure everything is clean and orderly around the small restaurant.  Even when it was busy, the staff seamlessly acknowledged every guest walking in and out, without skipping a beat for the existing patrons.  The patio is adorable and intimate. Bike racks in front for the neighborhood peeps like us, but a decent size parking lot out back for the rest. No fear if your in a hurry... They have drive thru !  Such a wonderful find in the neighborhood ! GO! RUN! EAT AT THE STAND !!!!  #yourewelcome

Unfortunately no matter the problems at this venue... Owners and management have made it clear they won't do anything about it. And why would they !? If a concert or artist is scheduled here that we are dying to see... We will go, no matter how painful the venue is to visit.  This venue has changed names and ownership so many times and each opportunity to upgrade, is apparently snuffed at. I have nothing new to add to the list of horrible things everyone has already heard but to sum it up... For $150.00 per ticket, I was so sadly disappointed by the following: - Lack of structured traffic control and parking staff. Took 1.5 hours to get in AND WE PAID for premiere parking passes! - there was no police traffic control for even the pedestrians... They were trusted to get their drunk selves across the street to the taxis !?  - lack of thorough security... Sure they checked our purses but no one scanned bodies and pockets... At one point during the concert, some guy was waving around a gun, scaring the living daylights out of the ppl around him! - the bar and concessions has a sign that says "staffed by volunteer"... Um no. Not for $150.00 tickets and $14.00 drinks, am I going to be tolerant of some volunteer group to take their time getting though the line of 85 people ! No. - they do not have nearly enough vendors walking through the crowds selling WATER. It was 107 and we are dying.  - for summer series concerts they need cooling stations around the venue and misting fans throughout the lawn and seats.    We sadly will not go back to this venue for a concert... They don't bring in anyone that is such a "must see" to make us live through that pain ever again.

What you've heard is true!! Amazing salads and pizzas. The staff seems so happy to work there and be hands on. They take great pride in the food themselves :). Loved that I could build my own pizza with dozens of topping choices, including the meats and cheeses ! This is the place for me! I love different types of salami, chicken and sausages...there's no "typical" only offered here!  Delicious :)

The menu is great. Something for everyone ... You have the classics and the twists. We enjoyed some of both. Caprese bruschetta and the BBQ pork butt bruschetta.  The nookerdoodle dessert was delicious and we had absolutely no problem finishing that off-- however, I do hope the pastry team may have had a bad day because there was hardly any shortening or compound ingredient in the tart of the dessert. It fell apart as though it was dry, rather than crumble as a tart should. A little too grainy because the coarse sugar did not melt into the crust.  Also, wishful thinking... Serve in a bowl or pasta plate ? It was so hard to eat ice cream etc on a plate !

The Gladly makes it's Sister Proud!  We have an on-going love affair with The Citizen Public house, so it was absolutely relieving to find ourselves in a restaurant with just the same pride in ambiance, decor, food and service!  We of course enjoyed our regular Original Chopped Salad (made famous by CPH) but strayed from the regulars through the rest of the meal.  Our server was passionate about the cocktails and gave mouth watering descriptions of the menu options...which of course were spot on!    The location in central phoenix is, 'different' as I would call it.  Located in a business park on Camelback, it is still easy to find and even easier to give directions to others to meet you there!  Enjoy with friends and family any night of the week !

Such a terrible waste of time :( I have suffered through a personal outing here with friends and then again for a company event. Because of the slow service, rude and un-attentive staff, LONG wait times to bowl or do anything really... Dozens of people from the group started leaving in huge waves. The clients paid so much for this and their group was having a terrible time! Ugh. Don't do group events here... These people don't know what the heck they are doing ! Don't even waste your own money going here with a date or small group of friends

So delicious and unique. Not intimidating at all for new juicers like myself. Friendly staff that will take time to talk to patrons even if it's a little busy. Fox knows how to hire the right people and train! Golden Child is my fav. The Pom Pom is also delicious!    4 stars and not 5 because of the prices... I completely understand that fruit is expensive, but at the rate they are selling, I wish they could spill over the profit and lower the prices a bit   CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE CAMELBACK & 40th street LOCATION OPENS!  Eeeeekkkkk! :)

If you dine here and don't enjoy their 85259 Creamy Burrata... Well I just don't know if you know what a fulfilled life tastes like :) !  We were so happy when Grassroots moved into Town & Country central Phoenix (now we don't have to tolerate the Scottsdale cougar & spoiled kid scene at their other location). Service at the north location is appalling and I won't... Can't go back there! But I digress.  The shrimp PO' boy is amazing and our favorite smoked brisket is here too!  We've got the fat kid & prego chick syndrome so we make no apologies when we order these hearty, hefty entrees together.  On the lighter side their salads are delish (Cardiff is my favorite).  Omgoodness! I almost forgot...even better: you can purchase their amazing dressings by the pint and take home for nearly a month's worth!    Great place to take everyone because anyone can find everything they like on the menu! Laid back casual dress setting... Very Phoenix :)  Enjoy!

I really wish I could have my money back. And I'm kind of embarrassed that this was a gift activity too.  I'm writing this review actually, as I stand in a Disney-length of line to partake in a simple and probably overrated video game activity. Pretty sure the website hyped this up much more than needed. The "times of entry" that you purchase tickets for, are overcrowded, for one... And for the first 45 mins you are here, nothing is happening.  There is a ratio of 5:1 kids to adults. The age of these kids!? 3-6 years old. The rules and FAQs do specifically state that this experience is for older kids and adults. And sure enough... A kid is crying next to me while the mother yells at the poor staff member because her kid is too small and unable to activate the video sensors.   For the price of $30 per person, and then paying $10 for parking... You too can enjoy crowded rooms full of snot nose kids, screaming parents, long lines to pathetic "experiences" and a marvel themed café!!!   ... A kid just threw himself on the floor in crying hysterics next to me
