Great TURKEY BURGERS: The BF loved the hamburger bun (he's a stickler about that) Fries are ehhh. Can't wait to go back and try other turkey sandwiches.

Being a native of Phoenix, I buy/cook mexican food at least once or twice week. This Saturday after a movie at the Esplanade, I drove into the Garcias drive-thru to get some early dinner. I always order a green burro, enchilada style with rice and beans.The wait was very reasonable compared to other take-out wait times. I felt like $8.89 was a bit more than what I usually pay, but no real complaint there either.   The food was piping hot and delicious. I wish I would have specified green enchilada sauce but the red sauce was very good. I can tell the reheat is going to HIT later on (excited).   I don't have anything bad to say about this place as it was recommended to me by one of my coworkers. I am from South Phoenix, so my favorites are Carolinas and Ritos, and sometimes Ponchos (on central). I am not familiar with any Westside mexican food so I'm so happy I get to add the OG Garcias to the list.

Massage vets: book Vanessa or Melissa for a great massage. I can tell they have been massaging for a while and they are good at what they do. I know they both have 5+ years experience. Provided excellent massage technique and just enough pressure to get the knots out! They don't smell, they don't talk your ear off and provide a smooth massage experience! Love them both!  Also enjoyed the renovations at the Camelback location.

Came in on on Friday night in September. I really wanted some good food and the full parking lot reassured that I made the right choice.   Sat down within 3 minutes, ordered food within 10 more minutes. Waited an HOUR for our food to come out!  I ordered the 6" Shrimp Po Boy with dirty rice. Mom ordered the 6" Catfish Po Boy with Red Beans and Rice. A lemonade (yuck) and half order of Fried Green Tomatoes to go along.   Bottom line:  Atmosphere : 2 stars Food: 5 stars Service: 4 stars  Will be back to try something else and a dessert.

I work close to yoshis and for quick and cheap sushi rolls, it works! The chicken bowl was also delicious with lots of veggies. This is my third time here since March and today I saw they just added a crepe station where you can get nutella, fruit and other sweet goodies as toppings; there are also savory options. I would definitely choose this place over samurai sams or kyoto.

Not service -oriented at all. I browsed the selection thoroughly enough to expect an offer to try on some frames.  Not to mention, all their frames are locked so its pretty much a given that most customers need service! Cute selection of eyeglasses though.

Ever since I saw their menu on my door, I have been dying to try this place. I went today and stuck with the basics: turkey and cheese, lays potato chips and a cherry Coke. First bite: the bread was nice and soft and the turkey was thin and lovely. Great lunch for 6.50 and I will definitelt return to try the pastrami.

It was a very hot week in Phoenix when I went, but we got there after 8am. We ate inside and you can definitely tell this is an event space, but I love that there were other patrons enjoying the restaurant already. I like the self-serve beverage table and especially the mini coffee creamers that I always use at 7-11 and Circle K in the morning. The waiter were friendly and they all had on "The Grove Cafe" attire, an update  I ordered the Green Chile Omelette (with pork) with hashbrowns and a biscuit on the side. Deelish! My favorite part was the biscuit: it was light and soft on the inside and the outside was crusty annnnd, I'm pretty sure they used whole wheat flour or something similar. Bonus points for added fiber.

I was quite impressed with the smoked turkey baked potato! The turkey was full of flavor and moisture. I tasted the bbq sauce (original and sissy) and both were very peppery, which I didn't like. My vote is 4.5 because because they handle money and the food with no gloves but our order was very good nonetheless.

I love the freshness of their dishes and their soups have all been delightful. I usually order Chicken Fried Rice and the War Wonton Soup (hold the wontons). The fried rice is seasoned well, piping hot, and has nice cuts of chicken breasts. The War Wonton soup is a clear broth soup with chicken, shrimp, carrots, snow peas, mushrooms, broccoli, zucchini, and green onions. The omission of the wontons are just a personal preference; I'm just not a fan. However, I also make sure to get a side of the crispy wonton strips to top off my soup ( =\ they charge 50 cents for the crispies). I love this place and will continue to frequent here a couple times a month.

Everything was fresh and truly made-to-order. Have you ever had a taco with piping hot fish and shrimp topped with cold poco de gallo, cabbage and creamy chipotle sauce? No? Well go to tortilla fish and come back to this review after you have experienced that first bite from Tortilla Fish. Yummm!

I came in while I had time to spare in between dental appointments. (Shoutout to Dr Serrano and Dr Day) I was hungry and finally had a chance to sneak in some me time so I decided to take myself to lunch. There's a ton of local eateries in this biltmore-ish area so I was determined to check something off my Yelp! Bookmark list. Urban tacos it is! In a seemingly boring strip mall but beautifully designed inside. The door was open and letting in the cool breeze of the day. I was short on time and didn't want to overindulge so I stuck to my budget and schedule and ordered a Corona 2 street tacos and a half order of chips and guacamole. The service was good. She recommended the green chile cilantro salsa which was excellent and the short rib taco, equally as good.   I love this place and hope I can return soon with the beau.
