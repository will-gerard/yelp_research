Yum. Baja fresh is the place to go if you want something a step up from Chipotle in variety and warmth as far as the food goes.  It's not finger licking if I don't have this I"m gonna die good, but the food is made fresh, and the customer service is always excellent Highlight: the plethora of salsa choices as well as fresh cut limes for your meal & if you so choose your coke like beverage. :)

It helps to know that I give Starbucks in general great reviews because I love it so much.  This starbucks gets 5 stars because the people there are so kind. I have met a different person every time I've been there, and each person is not only nice but personable.  They seem to genuinely care about the people walking through the door, and that, afterall, is an important part of enjoying your coffee experience, the smile that comes along with the cup. :) Special feature: Drive through***

Normally I get a little frustrated at hardware stores because I often don't even know the name of the thing I'm looking for, so I have to do that awkward "It looks like this and it's shaped like this, and it does this" with hand motions.  Well I did that this time and the person who listened to me was very helpful.  Then a true miracle happened.  I was standing waiting to get a key made.  The person making the keys was helping someone else.  All of the sudden, another employee of the store saw me, asked if I needed help, and then made a key for me. Bing bam boom. Done.  Very helpful and friendly store.

I went there last night and really had fun. I'm not the biggest fan of tons of televisions playing sports games, but if that's your thing, you'll give it a five star review.  We got the Asian wings, which were delish.  There's nothing over the top or extravagant here, but then again, that's what you should be expecting when you walk in the door. I got a flavored Mojito, and it hit the spot. Our server was really helpful, and handled our table of 15 well.  My friend played the game where you try to catch stuffed animals with a claw, and he actually got one, woohoo!

Burritos and Bodybuilders  There's not usually much decor in Chiptole.  They keep their decorations and their food simple and to the point. But if you're in the age range of 15-40, there's plenty of male eye candy.  I think I saw 3 men who's muscles were 5 times the size of mine.  In fact, most of the people in the restaurant were men.  I'm not sure why or how, but it made my tacos a little tastier. ;)  Enjoy!  Turns out what I thought they were putting in the rice was sugar, was actually salt. Sorry for the mistake Chipotle.

I don't know if it's this Rubio's, or all of them, but for some reason I really love this place.   Last night I got: Gourmet shrimp taco & Tortilla Soup. At first I was a little offended by the price, but after eating the Taco, i didn't care. I can taste the non-microwavedness of the food (freshness seems overused :). Taco was hot not warm, melted in my mouth.    The soup tasted like it was prepared right before I ate it, in a good way.  I think they actually mix all of the ingredients in it with the base right before they give it to you, that's why it tastes so good.  And who know you could put an avocado slice in soup. Not this kid. But it tastes great.   Not too greasy, food that's cooked right then and there so it's worth the wait. I'll go back for sure!

If you're lookin for a place that's smells like smoke and grease mixed together, than this is your mecca. I can't totally bash it here, the food is edible, but that's about where it stops.  **On the upside** I'm usually unimpressed by the person at the front who either has facial paralysis and therefor can't smile (in which case, please forgive me), or just really doesn't seem to give a crap about well, anything, but yesterday I went in to grab some food for my boss (who is always complaining it's too salty but still chows down on their grub regularly) and the guy behind the counter was really friendly.  He asked me if I wanted water while I waited (+ numero uno) and then gave me regular updates on the food (+ number dos). He was the saving grace of this restaurant.   Now if they could just jazz up their drunken noodle we'd be in business.

It seems most of the people working here are under the age of 25, but WAIT...it makes for a great experience.  Everyone is really friendly and chipper.    If a burrito could be sincere, these are, or at least they're very sincerely made.  Unlike other Chipotle's I've been to where you can tell the iron fist of the manager is guiding their every scoop, the employees here are generous with their ingredients.  You don't have to keep asking, "Can I have just a little bit more?" which I really appreciate, especially when it comes to guacamole!

Fast review for a fast restaurant!   REALLY FAST FOOD! But good quality.  Love the coffee at the end.  Don't get the meatballs.  Not sure what kind of meet they are, and too chewy, but other than that.  Great!

I really like going here for a quick but really yummy breakfast.  It has a variety of options.  It would be nice if they had more Gluten free options, that's the only reason it didn't get 4 stars. Really good egg scramble combinations.
