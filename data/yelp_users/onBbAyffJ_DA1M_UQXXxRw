My girlfriend and I love this place. Great atmosphere, service and food. The bar is really cool looking. I have never had anything less than outstanding service.   My girlfriend always gets the balsamic infused rib eye and I can't blame her. It is really good. I like to try different things, but my fall back is always the Maytag crusted fillet. I like that they have interesting specials too. the best was a special vegetable side. Buttered mint green beans sounded odd to me, so I had to try it. I am glad I did because they were awesome.   Great place to take a date.

Got to the pharmacy at 5:55PM to pick up my prescription and it was not only closed, but gates down and locked and lights off. Guess I will have to get the pain meds for my broken wrist tomorrow. Never coming back to this pharmacy ever again.

My girlfriend and I decided to check this place out after getting a coupon in the mail.   We started with the Cotija Grilled Corn, which I was skeptical about since I don't really like corn on the cob. It was actually so good that I finished mine and had the urge to steal hers right out of her hands. (I was able to restrain myself.)   I ordered the Black Chile, which was really good, but I think it could have used a little more spice. To be fair, I like really spicy food though. The rice was not traditional, but I really liked it. The beans I loved, which is unusual for me.   My girlfriend had the Beef Enchiladas, which she loved, and I thought were really good as well. She wasn't a fan of the beans like I was, but loved the rice.   I have saved the best for last though.. the drinks. Well, really just one drink in particular. The Strawberry Jalapeno Margarita was the best margarita I have ever had in my life. I actually find myself craving it. I will definitely be back for another of those, and to try some of the other drinks and menu offerings.

My girlfriend and I had a couple of the protein plates. She had the tri-tip with quinoa and I had the chicken with forbidden rice. Hers came with something like a teriyaki sauce and mine came with a coconut curry type sauce. They were both really good, and a lot bigger than I thought they would be. I could barely finish mine. I forgot to ask for no mushrooms, and they put a lot of them in there, but they were easy to pick out.   I also had the kale cleanse juice and it was good, but a little too much ginger and lime for my taste.   Some of the salads I saw when I was there looked really good too. I didn't get to see any of the sandwiches, but they sound good. Their breakfast sounds good too. There was a breakfast burrito and an acai breakfast bowl with fruit and granola I want to try.   The service was really friendly and fast too. I don't usually give out 5 star reviews on my first visit, but I will definitely be coming back to try their other offerings. If my future experiences are as good as this one, I will be updating my rating to a 5 for sure.

I figured I should update this since I have been back on multiple occasions now and tried more of the menu. I haven't had a single bad meal here. In fact, everything I have tried here has been great. Not only does everything taste amazing, I feel great after eating it.  My favorites here so far are the chicken protein bowl with quinoa, the tri-tip sandwich and the chicken and prosciutto sandwich. I was a bit worried about the sandwiches because of the whole wheat low-carb bread, but these did not have that cardboard taste that I have come to associate with low-carb. The bread seemed like a cross between a pita and wheat bread. They were nice and soft and the flavor was really good.  I have yet to try the salads or the breakfast, but I will get there. I have no doubt that they will be just as good as everything else so far.

Just tried this place today for lunch and I was impressed.  First off, they have an excellent beer selection with a lot of local beers. I could come here for the beer alone.  That said, the food was excellent as well. My girlfriend and I both ordered burgers. She had the mac and cheese burger and I had the steakhouse truffle burger. The flavor combinations were excellent on both. The onion rings were also really good. The only small imperfection was the temperature. We both ordered medium and hers was slightly below medium while mine was slightly above. Notice I said slightly. They were both still cooked within an acceptable range for us, but something to consider if you are really picky about such things.  Expect to pay a little more than you are used to for a burger. That said, the food is worth it and the portion sizes are big.  Originally, I was torn between the chili mac and the burger. I was happy with the burger, but after tasting the mac on my girlfriends burger, I will be coming back soon for that chili mac.  Last, but not least, the service was great. It wasn't very busy, so I can't say what it is like when it is, but our server was very friendly and helpful. She seemed very enthusiastic about the restaurant, the food and making sure we were happy.  Four stars for a first visit is the most I will give any place, but if subsequent visits are as good as the first, this will definitely be a five star.

Well, it has been a few months, and I have been back here a handful of times. I have now tried a few of the burgers, a couple different mac and cheeses (including the chili mac), and the parmesan truffle fries. Everything has been really great. I think my favorites are the chili mac and the steakhouse burger so far.  The service, however, has been hit or miss. Nothing horrible, but never as good as my first visit. We have had a couple less than attentive servers and there was one visit where the music from the kitchen was loud enough to be annoying, but mostly because it was clashing with the music they were playing in the dinning area. Like I said, not horrible, but not great.  With that said, the food and beer are great, but the inconsistent service won't let me justify changing my review to a 5. I would give the food a 4.5 and the service a 3.5 if it were possible to break it down like that.

I have been here for lunch a few times over the past month. They have a really good rotating beer selection. I like that they have a section on their beer list for what is going to be tapped next. They also have a very impressive selection of whiskey, which surprised me for a beer focused place.  I really like what they did with the layout. The bar is central and all around it is really open, but welcoming. It is a very comfortable environment to relax and enjoy your beer, food and company. (I have only been here for lunch, so I can't comment on the atmosphere in the evening yet.)  I have had a few of the items on the menu so far and I haven't been disappointed. Their mac and cheese is my favorite. If you like salads, you should really try the Farmer's Market salad. Great flavors, and a big enough to fill me up for lunch. It paired really well with the Founder's Rubeus that they had on tap at the time. I wasn't the biggest fan of the bread on the Pear, Brie and Jam sandwich I had. It was a little too thick and crusty for my taste, but that is just personal preference. That said, the sandwich still had really good flavor and I wasn't unhappy with it at all. The fries also had really good flavor, but I wish they had been more crisp. Again, personal preference.  I have had nothing but excellent service here, both at the bar and sitting at a table. It has never been very busy at lunch, but I have always had friendly and attentive service from everyone here.  The prices are also very good for what you get here. I will definitely continue coming in for lunch.
