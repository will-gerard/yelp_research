I've been here a few times for lunch now. Very consistent. The drive-thru guy is very courteous. The burgers are good. The fries are great. The ranch dressing is out of this world. I hate ruining great fries with dipping sauces (no ketchup) but dear lord the ranch brings them to a whole new level. Don't be scared by the outside appearance. It's worth a try!

Yesterday (Saturday) after taking part in the Walk to Defeat ALS our group of 6 decided to check out Lo-Lo's new location, right up the road from the old location that we tried once before and loved.  We arrived at 11:30am and after searching for parking for 10 minutes (they share a small lot with a hotel) we finally found spots (sorry, I don't trust a $30k automobile with a kid who barely looks old enough to drive at the valet station). Unlike another reviewer, we were not warned we may be towed and had we been told, we would have left then! We were told there would be a 30 minute wait- no surprise as there were tons of people there. We were told this was a short wait as people used to wait up to 2 hours at the old location. Didn't make us feel better, but decided to wait. At the time we were glad we did as we only ended up waiting about 10-12 minutes before being seated.  About 5 minutes after we were seated, our server arrived to take our drink order. I think her name was Gina but may be wrong. She was very polite and had a great sense of humor. We ordered our drinks and because we had an appointment at 1 asked if we could order. Our party had 3 adults and 3 teenagers. The first teenager ordered a burger and , truthfully, was very picky about what she did and did not want on it. The server was patient with her and wrote down everything she wanted. Next was another teenagers turn... He didn't know yet what he wanted. Rather than skipping him and taking the rest of our orders (the 3 adults were already decided) she said she would grab our drinks, take the drink order of another table and be right back.  Over 10 minutes passed and she returned with some drinks. She had to go back to get the remaining and to exchange one of the teen's drink as it had lime in it (fancy adding lime to koolaid) and he was allergic. She mixed up the sweetened and unsweetened teas which normally no big deal but the teen who ordered sweetened received unsweetened and had already added sugar since it was bland. We didn't say anything. By the time 1:00 arrived (remember we arrived at 11:30, with parking and the wait it was about 10 til noon when we were seated- over an hour sitting there) half the table had finished their drinks and not offered refills and our food still hadn't come out. A table behind us had a similar experience and was complaining to the server. A table of 3 across from us had ordered about 5 minutes before us (and was seated about 5 min after us) and was almost finished eating when our server came out to apologize, saying the kitchen uses a new system for getting orders and there was an issue with the system and the kitchen is backed up. If they were backed up then why did some tables receive food and some did not?  We asked how long the wait would be as we were already late for our 1:00 appointment (thinking perhaps we would get it to go). She said she couldn't say. May be 5 minutes, may be 20. We appreciated her honesty but decided to go. We offered to pay for our drinks but she said we did not have to. We left, over 90 minutes after we arrived in the parking lot and without food!  Obviously our biggest complaint is the wait. That is simply unacceptable. The lack of attention comes second. Any time we've experienced an unacceptable wait, the manager has come to apologize, usually offering to do something to right the situation. Not this time. There was nobody who looked managerial in sight. What a shame.  I live in Gilbert and was excited to hear about one opening up here soon. I will wait a month or 2 before going in hopes they work out their kinks and can offer a better experience. Sadly, I don't think we'll return to their Scottsdale location again.

Love Zookz!  I work downtown so time was limited. I ordered online from their website, zookzsandwiches.com. It was so simple to do. I got to choose my pickup time. I got there at noon and was able to go directly to the counter.  The cashier was friendly and had a big smile on her face.  My food was out within 60 seconds and my sandwich (the #45) was nice and warm- and 10 minutes later when I got to my office it was still warm and fresh.  I had kale salad on the side. The flavors were excellent and ingredients were fresh and crisp!  With placing my order to go, I did not get a good look at inside, however I did notice it was clean and open to the outside eating space in the front.  With the quick & easy online ordering, the quick & friendly staff, and the fresh & delicious food, I will definitely be back!

We've been here twice now.  Both times was a Sunday around 11:am.  Both times we were told there would be about a 35-45 minute wait so we decided to wander around and run a quick errand.  When we returned 30 minutes later, our names had been called.  Since we weren't there they had given our table to the next party, but they put us on the top of the list and were seated within 2 minutes.  Lesson learned- the wait isn't nearly as long as they say it will be!  I will say, maybe because we've been there during a busy time, but the girls at the hostess stand didn't seem very happy. Both times I had the chicken fried chichen with waffle.  The waffle was average to good, but the chicken was awesome.  This is why I've yet to try something else- a decent waffle and a great piece of chicken is hard to beat.  Add saracha hot sauce to the chicken- a little is all you need!  YUM!  The servers, unlike the hostess, have been great.  Checked on us regularly, kept us updated on the status of our order, and best of all, they smiled.  My partner has had one of their breakfast sandwiches and a scramble with egg whites and steak.  The scramble looked (and according to him tasted) delicious.  Lots of meat!  Their prices are pretty average for the area.  The decor is nice and bright, it is very open and clean- a great place to start your day.  We've been there twice in a month and hope to keep going!

I have yet to meet an Upwards Project establishment that I didn't like!    The decor is awesome. Hip and comfortable. The outside patio chairs look uncomfortable but are. The chairs inside look comfy too.  The patio has misters- and you don't get soaked!!     The menu is simple. Tacos, burritos, sides, desserts, and a nice drink menu. As any good restaurant should, they brought out complimentary chips and salsa. Very tasty!  Chips were nice and crispy!  I had the chicken burrito.  My only complaint was the menu did not specify mushrooms were in it. It only mentioned a garden variety mix. Luckily they were huge chunks so easy to remove!  I also had the Mexican corn. If you like cheese, you'll love this.  Cheese was all I could taste. $5 for a piece of corn was a bit much, so between that and the fact the food does not come with a side (no rice or beans?).  This is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  The food was excellent though.  We also shared dessert. The Mo's Definitely was good, and I can't wait to go back and try the others.   The drinks were great too!  I had the Mexican Mule. Nice for a warm summer day out on the patio. My friend had a blood orange margarita, that was good too!  Finally, I have to comment on the service. We went on opening day (6/4) and I expected slow, quirky service. Nope!  Other than the fact our server thought the corn came with 2 cobs, which he quickly corrected himself on, he knew the menu, made great recommendations, had out stuff out to us fast and brought exactly what we ordered. All of the staff there were very friendly, smiling, always checking up on us and refilling water. You'd never know they just opened, no opening day kinks that I could see.  This is a great addition to the area, I can't wait to go back and taste more of the menu!

I've been there 4 times now. A random Thursday afternoon,  a Wednesday night, and 2 Saturday afternoon/evenings. No matter how busy it was, I always had prompt service. They are great with recommendations and are cool with letting you sample beers. The app is awesome for tracking what beers you've had & lets you make notes!  Inside is nothing great, it's kinda small. I love the patio bar- when you can get a seat. You've gotta try the giant pretzel & upgrade to cheese unless you're a mustard fan. The sliders are ok, although next time I'm ordering them without mustard- it overpowered the brat.

We've been here twice  now and have enjoyed it both times. I'm a huge fan of Postinos which is not too far so I had high expectations. For some reason, the ambiance isn't as good as Postinos, I think it's just because of the location and size.  Both times we were there they had live music. That was something I really enjoyed. It wasn't so loud that we couldn't hear each other either!  They have a happy hour with lots of options but I've always been there after it ended. The wine prices are ok, a little high compared to Postinos selection but not out of control... And they have a good selection of wines by the bottle and glass. They also offer flights which sets them apart. I didn't try their bruschetta only because I always get that from Postinos and wanted to try real food. I ordered the meatball lettuce wraps. OMG that was great. The meatballs were pork and so flavorful. They also included cilantro, shredded carrot, and cucumber. I was ready to cancel my dinner order and order another plate of meatballs!  For dinner I ordered the daily special flatbread. It had white sauce, chicken, jalapeño, cilantro. Very good as well. Big enough to share as an app or have for dinner. The first time I ate here I didn't not have an appetizer and had the pasta dish. It was huge and very tasty. The service was great both times and we never had a long wait (although both times we went it was around 7:30pm).  When I want light food and a place to sit and chat, Postinos is still my go-to place but for date night, MWC Bistro is where we'll go!
