My husband and I came to Rio Rico for the first time last week. We were even lucky enough to make it in time for happy hour. The house margaritas were delicious!  We had the carnitas as well as the chile relleno with beef flauta and every single bite was great. To top it off, we received awesome service by our waiter, Mario. When we return we will definitely ask for him!

I went to Yen Ching's for the first time last night with my mother. I was probably several decades younger than the majority of the clientele as well as the decor but don't let that fool you. This was probably some of the best Chinese food I have had in quite a while. I'll be taking my husband (he's very picky about Chinese food) here soon so he can try it out too! Thanks for a great meal (and tons of leftovers), Yen Ching!

First off, I have NEVER posted a negative review on Yelp before but I have also never felt as disrespected by a business before. My husband and I have gone to this spa for several years now and experienced poor customer service from the front desk at nearly every visit. We continued to go because we enjoyed the therapists but today was the last straw. The appointment was booked for a 90min massage and confirmed verbally by the receptionist at the time of booking. When the email confirmation arrived only the day before the appointment it read 60min. We contacted the spa only to essentially be called liars by the "manager" who answered our calls then laughed at us for asking if we would be charged for a late cancellation. If you don't mind rude staff and disrespectful owners, then by all means go here. Getting a massage should relieve your stress not be the cause of it! I'm more relieved to know I'll never have to worry about dealing with these people ever again.

Tonight was my first visit to this store. The food was great and the servers were friendly (especially Jeff who gave my roomie and I a sample of some tasty sangria). I'll definitely be returning!
