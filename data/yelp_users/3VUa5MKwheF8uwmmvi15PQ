I know why they don't have one of these in California. F'reals... if they opened this up, UCSD asian-ness would be all over it in a crazy eating frenzy.   Came here with UCSD dragon boat team before a race day and heck, we were ready to stuff our faces! This place makes Khan's Mongolian Grill in UTC look like trash.  Instead of yelling at you for piling on too many meat (or veggies if that's your thang), this place ENCOURAGES it! Yeah! Plus, you can opt for one massive bowl or if you're a crazy big eater, you can opt for unlimited bowls. YC must stand for "You Crazzzzzzzy" if you eat that much. Only downside here is that all the sauces kind of taste the same after a while.  If that's not enough for your stomach to explode, there's endless soup, chips, rice, drinks, and frozen yogurt for you to gorge on.   They take all your needs into account... including a plunger in each stall of the bathroom. Awesome!!

Asian buffets scare me... I usually don't know what half the stuff is, and if I do know what it is, it's a microwaved crazy sauced version of what I'm used to. Granted, I came here with a hungry hoard of UCSD dragon boaters, so we were all starved from a long day of paddling. Yes, I ate, but I was terrified that everyone would be sitting on a toilet for the rest of the night and that we would be totally unable to paddle our races the next day.  Microwavable edamame was my friend since I saw the costco sized bags sitting on the side (I figured I'd be safe with these), and I attempted to try everything else like the random seafoods, mushy sushi, and fatty meats. Their desserts were weird generic cakes that seemed to be salvaged from the sale section of the local grocery bakery, so I stuck with the frozen yogurt.  Lots of better options out there, but I guess since there were about 50 of us, we were limited.

Cute, hip, and with healthy options, La Grande Orange offers the hungry, tired traveller some good eats away from home.   What I was most impressed about by this place (aside from the fact it is not only a pizzeria, sandwich shop, bakery, grill, and gelato shop!!!) is that they offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options on their menu. They are well staffed and speedy.  I got their spicy chickpea lettuce wrap, which was chickpea, avocado, and sundried tomato on lettuce wraps since I was craving something filling, but healthy and not too heavy for my slightly upset tummy. Was very pleased with the size of it for the price, especially since it came with a little fruit salad! Cost me right around $8.   While waiting, I eyed other people's pizzas, burgers and fries, and baked goodies. All quality items!! Of note were their huge cookies, like the sea salt chocolate chip cookie.   Overall an amazing airport place. Would hit this place up even if it were not in an airport. Considering the prices, you wouldn't guess it to be airport food!
