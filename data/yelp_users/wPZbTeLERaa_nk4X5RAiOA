This place has one of the best HH's around.  The beers are fairly cheap in price and you get a lot of beer.    The tempura snap peas and asparagus are amazing.  The steaks are also good.  I will definitely be enjoying a free sirloin on my bday.  So join the bday club here.  The chocolate martini's are amazing as well (so says my gf).  They're clear and you can't even taste the liquor, just chocolate.  It's not on their list of martini's but order it and you will have a great chocolate fix as well as get drunk.

This is also very good Pho.  I think I still prefer Song Lynn over this but this is still really great Pho.  This place is slightly cheaper than Song Lynn which is great but same problem I had, the bowl is too small.  I wasn't even asked if I wanted a large bowl or not so when it came out I was disappointed by the portion size.    Taste wise, great Pho.  Price wise, perfect.  Portion size, disappointing.  Get the large bowl if you're getting Pho.

I could go into a long story about what happened but basically the girls taking cover and the bouncers can't count and are douches.  Will never go back to the place again.

Tried this the other day.  It was very tasty.  I didn't know it was Vietnamese at first by the name.  I was hoping for all sorts of different noodle dishes so that was slightly disappointing but I go some good pho and was very happy with it.  I had to add some spicy to it though which I thought made it better but it's a good price for a very sizable portion.    Great choice is you're looking for some good pho and are in the area.

Been here a few times now and love it.  If you're going for appetizers the ribs are fabulous.  The bartenders are friendly and cute.  The waitresses are also very nice and friendly.  Love just hanging out and people watching here with friends. The sake bombers are a great price will definitely get you lit.

I'm a big noodle and ramen fan.  This is a terrific place so far.  I've only tried a couple of their dishes but have not been disappointed yet.  Their default republic ramen dish is pretty solid and has good flavor.  I'd like to get back and try some of the others.  It would be nice if they possibly offered some of their dishes with a choice of noodles but being a ramen house they specialize in that type.  Very friendly staff and great portions for the price.  It would probably be best to add extra addins but then the price does tend to go up.  All in all it's a solid place for some good ramen.

Great tasting paletas.  All natural flavors, lots of real fruit.  The Mexican Hot Chocolate will satisfy any chocolate craving you have.  The Platano one is probably my favorite if you have a sweet tooth, that is the one to get.  The strawberry and orange/tangerine cream ones are also fantastic.  I think I've tried every flavor now.  It's hard to pick a favorite to be honest.  The Mango con Chile has some kick, it's cold but hot at the same time.  How do they do that?    Also, the drinks are yummy too.  The sidral mundet is great on a hot day in AZ.  Only takes cash but they are cheap considering the quality of the product.   And the digital moving menu looks awesome and is neat to stand and read the banners when they change.  Don't forget to come in an get a free paleta on your birthday.  If you missed that banner, made for a cheap dessert for my gf on her bday.

This is very down home good cooking.  The cinnamon bun was amazing.  HUGE, butter, lots of icing.  I thought I had a sweet tooth and this was a bit much for me.  Delicious though.  Was a little disappointed with my omelet, had the southwest special, it was light on the chorizo.  But the side... Full Order of Biscuits & Gravy... made up for the whole meal.  Amazingly light, fluffy, right out of the oven biscuit.  And the sausage gravy is some of the best I've had in AZ hands down.  And a full order is also HUGE.  I imagine all the plates are that way which makes it that much better cause you always have something to take home.  Prices were relatively cheap as well.  Was surprised how cheap two of us got out of there for breakfast along with 3 pieces of pie/cake to go.  If I lived on the west side, this would be a bad place for me but definitely good eats.

Great tints.  The Madico Wincos look really good.  Couple problems with my initial install but they redid the 2 windows that had issues at no added costs.  Great customer service, they want you to be happy with your tints.  Haven't hit the summer heat yet but so far I'm loving the tint job and heat reduction I'm getting.

I've been trying all the various ramen shops in the Phoenix area.  This is hands down the best ramen I've had thus far.  They were kind enough to provide us samples of their different broths although they did not have their Tonkotsu broth available at the time, I did get the Paitan broth although I think next time I will try the Shoyu one.  Now that being said there were a couple things I do wish they would change... Price, people have complained about the price and if you get enough add-ons the price does get pretty high.  I kept my add-ons simple this time around as I wanted to get the base experience here.  So I ended up with a reasonable $11 bowl of ramen which isn't terribly bad.  Considering they're very, very close to ASU, I figured it'd be slightly cheaper to attract the student crowd but remembering my college days the instant ramen was sufficient and much more affordable so hopefully that doesn't bit them later due to the location.  The other thing I want to discuss is the temperature, the brother came out fairly good.  It could have been a little hotter though (temperature, not spicy) as it's seems a lot of the ingredients are put in cold and expected that the broth will heat them up and cook them slightly more... unfortunately this has the added effect of really cooling the broth down more than it should.  So either the broth needs to be much hotter which might effect it's taste or they really need to pre-heat the ingredients more so it's not so drastic of an effect on the temp of the broth.  I'm still a big fan as I said as it is definitely my favorite ramen place so far.

I've been trying Pho places all over the valley.  This is by far my favorite so far.  Great broth, didn't have to add anything except some chili sauce to spice it up.  Great flavor.  The only problem is that you really must buy the large bowl to get enough.    The large bowl should just be their default bowl I think.

So normally I'm a huge fan of Chipotle so it's with a heavy heart that I write this review.  This review is more about the service though than the food.  I typically go to this Chipotle after my workouts because I feel it is a very healthy alternative when I am to tired to cook.  Tonight though, I usually order a veggie bowl which normally gets guacamole on top, they ran out on the person right in front of me.  Instead of discounting the veggie bowl or offering me free chips, which I asked about, they told me no basically and have me some excuse about a point system.  I can't imagine those chips are anywhere in the same price range as the guacamole and they probably go stale if they don't sell them out that day, so why not make a customers day a little happier when you can.   This will probably, in  no way, affect me going back but as a new vegetarian I look forward to the guacamole on my veggie bowl.
