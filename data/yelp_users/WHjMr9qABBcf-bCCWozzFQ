Friendly, family owned. Great coffee, free wi-fi and punch card if you buy nine you get one free. Great if you drink a shitton of coffee like I do. Im a grab n go type of gal but there's a nice patio on the lake if you are that guy that hangs at coffee shops. Could use better artwork/decor inside though. Update: of course the day after I posted this, the internet in my house goes out, so I head to the coffee rush to be "that guy" as I put so eloquently before, and finish some business with their wifi. The owner was there, turns out they were closed for renovations, but he offers us free coffee and pulls a chair for us to sit on the patio. Very friendly, and apparently redecorating.. so I felt the need to add another star. definitely a fan.

I've been to Cyclo twice. The first time was great. The food and service was really good. Pretty reasonably priced. Really loved the fact that you could bring your own wine. Went back about a year later. Again, food was great. The garlic green beans as good as I remember. Pretty good service. The owner was there again in another cute little dress (sorry, but I notice that kind of shit). Liked the check holders had customer graffiti all over them (more dumb shit I notice). Finished the wine and meal, hit up the bathroom before leaving. Only one and it was occupied. Fine, it's a small place I understand. Wait a bit, then our spiky haired waiter comes out. He gives me a shifty look, which I didn't understand. I Immediately get it once I make my way in and look at the toilet. Didn't even put the seat up. Piss everywhere. I was so mad. Unfortunately, the bill was paid and he was tipped by the time I came out. F'n disgusting. I hate to judge the place by one waiter, but feel like if they are gonna let this ahole work here, can't help but think what else they might be letting slide.   Sorry, won't be back.

So, I've been trying to check this place out for awhile. I love b-fast, almost as much as staying up late and sleeping in, so it did take me awhile to check it out before they closed at two (my average wake up time). In fact I arrived right at two, which having been a server, I know sucks. Our server Marci was super nice and welcomed us in anyway, without even one look of contempt, which I know is what I would have delivered had I been serving a table at closing time. The food was delicious, and it being a "fuck it" day, ordered bacon wholeheartedly. It was the most delicious, thick cut bacon I've had. And the rest of the meal was delicious and reasonably priced. Next time I'm awake early (or up late) I'll be back.

Went here cause I've heard from a few people it was good. Being a huge fan of Mexican food, I had to check it out. Pretty nice happy hour special, half off appetizers. Very nice staff. Food was just ok. Queso dip was the consistency of water. Valle luna is still the best i've had. Manager was very helpful and eager to please, but the food was just ok.

Switchblade salon is by far one of the best salons in the state. It's staffed by two of the most talented and creative stylists I've ever met. I switched to Switchblade from Toni and Guy about 7 years ago and haven't turned back since. Melinda always makes sure I get exactly what I want, no matter how long it takes. She is a styling perfectionist, and I always leave happy. Amazing considering I am also a perfectionist when it comes to my hair, and have left salons in the past in tears. The salon itself is very sheik and artfully decorated. I am always offered a beverage and Melindas head massages are awesome.

My all time favorite sushi place.  Very fresh, which is most important in a sushi resturant. Combats sushi I've had in japan. Owner Jackie is very sweet and always gives us a warm greeting. Service has always been horrible and slow, which made me glad, so this delicious sushi place would be kept my little secret. The last time I was in the service was quite a bit better. If you're a big sushi fan like me, great taste overrides waiting a while for your drink or check. Will keep coming back.

I went to this restaurant after a recent health kick, and had heard some good things, so I decided to check it out. The restaurant is more of a order at the counter, fast food looking atmosphere. I ordered the gobi manchurian, and the paper masala dosai. Let me just say, the gobi manchurian is one of the best things I've put into my mouth. And it's vegan! The dosai came to our table, and it was unbelievably big. Humorously so. But really tasty. The staff was really friendly, and I can't get enough of the bollywood music videos. Really great food. Will be back.

Best hot dog I've had in the states. Willy was incredibly nice, gave us a bowl of free chili, chatted with us, and showed us his steeler tattoo. Not to mention it's located in one of the best antique markets I've ever been to.

I literally squealed with delight when I found out P. Willys was open on my birthday. Got the Mailman Rick sandwich and started questioning why we don't eat here every meal. And now they serve breakfast! Holy shit! Complete with a birthday song from Randy! I love it!

Found this place on accident, on my way to see my dad in Gilbert. I went to euro cafe and they were closed, but a nice blonde buisness lady directed me to Bergies.  I love it here. Wish I lived closer. It's charming and quaint without being hippy. And they've got the best coffee I've had. Iced toddy with an inch of soy is the f'n best. And the bearded fellow ( owner?) who helps me is always most pleasant.

Ate here after another mediocre  movie choice and it was so good, it saved the day.  The croation (owner?) was amazingly helpful and gracious. He talked with us and treated us like family.  He pulled a table outside so my dad and I could sit in the sun. Even gave us sweet dates at the end of our meal to "finish with something sweet." Sanwiched in between two chain resturants, it's easy to miss, but don't be swayed. Support the small business owner and check it out. The lentil soup is delicious and my father said the same for his sausage sandwich.

I've been meaning to leave a review for months, now I finally have time. That it's still important to me after all this time is a testament to how great my experience was.  I went to the store with my dad, who after years of using a shitty pc that ran painfully slow finally succumbed to my pro-apple pressure. His crap pc took its final dump, and I took him to the store to browse the desktop computers.  We were helped by Greg F., who was extremely helpful and kind. My dad is a quadrapalegic, so Greg told us about the options available to mac users that don't have use of their hands. He told us if we brought in a hard drive with the pc back-up and paid $100 for the introductory 1 on 1 classes, they'd transfer all his info onto his new mac for us for free.  My dad needed some time to think it over, we didn't end up coming back in until a couple weeks later. When we entered the store, Greg recognized us immediately, blew my mind by remembering my dads name.  He helped us pick out the right mac, got us into the genius bar without an appointment, and even threw in the special keyboard my dad needed for free.  Then at the genius bar we met Fladdy, who said he was going to get all my dads data transferred while we wait, a process that usually takes 24 hours.  So in about 45 mins my dad left with a new mac loaded with all his old PC's information, and I left with a whole new appreciation for apple.
