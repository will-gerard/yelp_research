Before coming in to dine here we all read the Yelp reviews which show 2.5 stars over 76 reviews and went in anyway ?@#^&%@$    They were all correct... Over priced for marginal quality with slow service. We decided to go for the experience and to say we had eaten at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.   Maybe the best plan if you wanted to "experience it" is to go for drinks and possibly appetizers, listen to some music and then go across the walkway to Yard House to eat.  If you were wasted in Margaritaville the bad food and high prices would not bother you. ... so who knows.. maybe that IS the marketing plan!   No one was happy with their order, it was slow and not really very appealing.... that being said.. we won't ever be back.    The music was fun we saw some AZ Cardinals eating there but the food not so much! Won't be back.

Amazing place to eat! Everything is always fresh and beautifully presented.   Your taste buds will have a new bar to jump over when trying to compare entrees for lunch or dinner with other places.  My favorite: SEARED AHI CAESAR seared rare, hearts of romaine, parmesan crisps, croutons and egg free caesar dressing.  I feel so appreciated as a customer because when you check on on foursquare they tweet you back and thank you for visiting.   I hope other restaurants are reading this and take note... with the fight for the consumer discretionary dollar making the customer feel good bring repeat and referral business!    Don't be put off by the name....come even if you don't drink because it is so much more than a bar to get a yard of beer!   The service is great food is fantastic!  Must try you will be happy!
