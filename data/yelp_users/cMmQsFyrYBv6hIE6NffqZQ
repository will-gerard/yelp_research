This is an interesting property that is attempting to be nice in an area that is a mixed bag of new/old/and just plain worn out.  The hotel is attempting to remodel and is doing a fair job at it.  The furniture is new, beds new and bathrooms remodeled.  There is a no smoking policy, but the lobby smells like smoke and the manager who talks about the non-smoking policy smells like a giant cigarette.    The part where this goes bad is the management.  The main manager does not deal well with the public and I'm really not sure how this place is still in business with him running it.    Pay the extra $40 (I did) and stay at the Marriott (Springhill Suites) one block west on Van Buren.  Quiet, clean, big rooms, hot tub, friendly staff, big breakfast, store on site so you don't have to cross Van Buren and worry about the sketchy Circle K across the street.  I do not recommend this NOT-SUPER 8 motel.

I tried Pane Bianco last week and very glad I did  Yum!  My coworker and I went their for lunch and I had their mozzarella sandwich, then went next door and got a cup of dark roast from Lux.    I wish they had some indoor seating since it was rather chilly outside, but we did find a seat in Lux to eat.    Great food and great coffee at Lux.  Give them a try!

As usual Apple has taken care of me without a hassle. Two macs, years of happiness.  The power module for my MacBook Pro went out 55 days after my AppleCare expired, but they replaced it at no charge.    When I went to the store I did not have a "Genius" appointment, but they did help me out after I told them I didn't live near an Apple store and I was on my lunch break.  Thank you!  Once again Apple has proven itself to be an excellent company with great customer service.

This Ace is close to my home and they usually have everything I need as well as staff members who know what they are talking about.  The person I like to work with most is Sam.  He really does a great job of helping me find what I need and suggesting better ways to do perform a task if my initial description is incorrect.    The rest of the staff is helpful and courteous and the prices are in line with any other place I visit for home projects.

I've been eating at Cyclo for many years now and I have never had a bad meal.   I always start with the black pepper shrimp and since I've switched to a mostly vegetarian diet the past two years my choices have narrowed a bit, but Justina always modifies the food so it fits.   Over the years I've had pretty much everything on the menu and whenever a friend asks me what to get I say, "Close your eyes and point, you won't be disappointed".   The Vietnamese coffee at the end of dinner is a perfect ending to any meal.   The desserts are great and when I do get it I like the Mango Sticky Rice or the Creme Brulee. Both will not disappoint.   Justina is a great and I think it is funny when people take her too seriously. She has fun with her customers and they should have fun with her. She can take it as much as she can dish it out so just relax.   There have been some comments that when Justina is not there the experience is not the same. How could it be? There is only one Justina and once you get to know her you'll realize she is really much more than a crazy hostess. She is a really nice person.   I hope you enjoy Cyclo as much as I have.

Dr. Elliott has been my dentist for about fourteen years and I look forward to each visit.  Dr. Elliott and her staff are professional, cordial, helpful, patient and truly work to make sure my teeth are in their best condition possible.    I went through InvisAlign to fix my smile and am extremely happy with the results.  This was about four years ago and they have been helpful from the beginning to the present with their care.  If you are looking for a fantastic dentist look no further than Dr. Anita Elliott!!!

I was looking for a place to get my struts replaced and one of my friends recommended Granite Reef Service Center.  Mike is a great guy and tells you exactly what you need and does try and sell you more than that.  The work was done on time, at the estimate quoted and was done well.  I would recommend this business to anyone and have already told a few people about my excellent experience.  Check them out, you won't be disappointed.

I've had Cafe Boa over the years and have never been too enthusiastic about their food.  Last night I gave them another chance and it really will be the last time I go back unless it is only for drinks/appetizers for happy hour.  I had the seafood ravioli which consisted of five or six small raviolis filled with a mix of seafood.  They were not stuffed full of seafood, they had some seafood.  The sauce was overpoweringly salty and just didn't taste great for the $22 price.  I had initially thought that the price would mean it would be tasty and be of decent proportions.  I should have remembered my previous experiences with this place.  You do not get what you pay for here.    The wine was decent (Malbec from Napa) and the appetizer was small and overpriced as well.  Never say never, but I'm really trying to say never again to Cafe Boa.

Classic Italian Pizza was recommended to me by some friends who said, "You may think it's not there, but it is."  Oh yes, it is and is fantastic.  I crave their food!  Being a vegetarian many places don't have much to offer, but their menu offers many different options for those of us who don't eat meat anymore.  I have introduced many family and friends to this restaurant and each one of them has returned many times.  The appetizers are fantastic (Aglio Olio is my favorite) as well as any pizza I have had and any others that my friends have tried.  Give them a try, you won't regret it (I hope!).

This shop always goes above and beyond. Thanks!  I purchased the Ecopia EP100 tires for my Prius and they have been fantastic tires and when I had a nail in my tire the quickly fixed the tire and put my spare and all of the various tools back where they were supposed to be in my car.  Great work.

Trader Joe's always goes above and beyond in all of their services.  The food is fresh and delicious, the prices reasonable and the people are great.  I do agree with Xurri R. concerning their minuscule produce section, but other than that it has 99% of what I need.

Very inexpensive, clean room.  Small room, but all I did in there was sleep so that doesn't matter to me.  I paid $96 for three nights!  Having a Dunkin Donuts in there is a great idea!  Easy coffee in the morning and better than Starbucks (cheaper too!).   The buffet was awful, there are many better options for food around there.

Always good after many visits over the last ten plus years. If they have the pumpkin empenada you must get it.  The slow roasted garlic pork is amazing and even though I haven't had it for years after going vegetarian I still recommend it to everyone who accompanies me to Los Dos Molinos.  They all love it!

I've been eating Oregano's for about ten years now and after switching to vegetarian it is still tops on my list.  Their Veggie Wedge is really delicious and there are still many meatless options when dining at Oregano's.    The Pizza Cookie is always on the list of things to eat and we always get it half/half.    In ten years I have never been disappointed by the staff members or the food.  Great people, great fun and always great food.  The new Dobson/Southern location is the closest to my home so I have been eating there since it opened.  The location in Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale have been visited in the past.   Parking has consistently been an issue when going to Oregano's, but the Mesa location has plenty compared to the other two I have visited.  Enjoy!

The Greene House had been talked up by a few of my friends so I knew I had better check it out.  I am accustomed to the unique and delicious meals created at Tru Food and expected something better due to the higher prices, but it was not delivered. The service and atmosphere were great, but the entree I ordered was something that would come out of the Applebees kitchen.    I ordered the trout which is something normally prepared very simply and although the ingredient list in the meal's description did have quite a few ingredients it was how they were put together that ruined the meal.  When the dish was brought to the table I thought, "this isn't mine" because of how it looked.  Trout should be served very simply with no breading, gravy or anything else to cover the taste of the fish.  The people at the next table even commented on it.    I did bring this up to the server who also thought they overdo it on the trout.  My friend had another dish that was quite good.  I'll stick with Tru Food.

2010/07/08 - Had dinner at Cibo tonight with a friend and once again I am impressed with their service and food.  We started with some wine, the veggie plate which was much larger than expected (in a good way) and then the Genova pizza which is a white pizza with pesto, potatoes, onions, cheese and maybe a few others.  The wait staff was excellent too!  I look forward to my next trip to Cibo.

I stop at D'lish almost every morning for a large coffee and a bagel.  The coffee is delicious and is great black.  To me the sign of a good coffee is one I can drink and enjoy without adding sugar or cream and this is it.  The D'veggie (sp?) bowl for lunch/dinner is so good I would eat it every day.  I did try their version of breakfast oatmeal the other week and it was phenomenally good.  I will definitely be having it again.  2010/10/06 - Went for lunch today with some coworkers and it was as good as always.  All of the inside tables were full, but it was cool enough to sit outside and the guys brought our food out to us.  One of my friends had the protein burger and said it was really good.  I once again had the D'Veggie bowl and really need to get something else, but it is SO GOOD!

I have been going to McClintock Animal Care Center for almost ten years and could not imagine going any where else.  The staff is always so friendly and their love of all animals shows through their words and actions.  My dogs don't mind their visits and that is very important to me.  All of the vets on staff are fantastic, but Dr. Duplissis is who we visit.  She has shown such compassion for me and my pups as we have had to make difficult, heart wrenching decisions over the years.  My pups and I will continue to support them as they have supported us.  I can't say enough good things about them and recommend them to anyone who asks me for a good vet.

Trying it tonight...will update.  UPDATE!  Had a Tuesday special 1/2 off bottles of wine which was perfect for a first time visit.  The Six Goat Cheese Stuffed Peppedews were excellent and then we moved onto the Gnocchi with Fresh Sage Butter and Roasted Vegetables along with the Angel Hair Pasta with spinach, shrimp and tomatos.  Both entrees were perfectly sized portions, flavorful and well prepared.  A stranger recommended Amanos to me and I will certainly go again.    The restaurant is small (30 people max - guess), clean and quiet with soft music playing over the sound system.  There is a bar which had a few couples chatting and the dining room was fairly busy with a little over half of the tables full.  The restaurant is located near 16th Street and Baseline and is a nice option for those of us in the south Phoenix / South Mountain area who don't feel like driving into Phoenix or out into one of the suburbs.    Give it a try, you just might like this great little restaurant.

I have been to this Toyota Dealership before for my car's service, but this time I felt I needed to write a review because it was a very good experience.  The last one was fine too, but this one deserves some recognition.  When I pulled into the service reception area (garage) I was greeted promptly, told them why I was there (made an appointment for an oil change - 50k service), signed the appropriate paperwork and went into the building to go to the waiting area.  On the way there I stopped at the parts department to see if they had anything I wanted.  I did get some touch-up paint for my car and that was even reasonably priced for a dealership.  When I went to pay for the paint I noticed a sign that said "Free iPad use while waiting" so I asked about that, signed the check out sheet and had a shiny new (?) iPad in my hands.    While sitting and playing with the iPad I saw quite a few people using their little cafe area to get coffee, bagels and other snacks.  So...I wandered over there to see what I could find since I only had a coffee before heading up to the dealership.  They had a cooler with all sorts of sandwiches, drinks, etc.  I asked how much the coffee and bagels were and was told that they were free...free?!  Yep. So I grabbed a bagel, cream cheese and a coffee, and sat in the cafe area drinking my coffee, eating a bagel and playing Scrabble on the iPad.  I did beat the machine at normal level so next time around I am going to step it up to difficult.  When the service person came to tell me my car was ready he also explained that I had a recall on the car and they took care of that too.  I have a Prius so they wanted to fix something that didn't need fixing.  There was that whole BS about the gas pedals sticking so the gov't made Toyota replace some parts so that the floormat wouldn't get stuck under the gas pedal.  Whatever.  I've had this car since it was new in 2007 without a single issue with anything!    The service people were very friendly and did not try to talk me into anything I didn't need so the visit was a relatively inexpensive one.    I will definitely go back to Camelback Toyota for my services and when I need a new hybrid or electric vehicle they'll be on my list for my next purchase.

This last visit sealed the deal (for now) for me and Camelback Toyota.  I had a free oil change and after a repair done under warranty by RiverView Nissan (see review) I had a few parts missing.  Camelback Toyota took care of the missing parts and did not charge me.  Their facility is great, the upstairs quiet area (no kids) is great for adults who just want to wait in a semi-silent space for their car.  If you want to work with a great service manager, see Ed Hammer.  He has always provided courteous and thorough service.  I'm not a huge fan of going to dealerships, but Camelback Toyota has always done an excellent job for me.

Had part replaced due to recall, now making odd noises from that part. They want me to pay $100 to get it checked out. How does that make sense? Might be service tech's bad decision, but this does not make me want to continue to give them my money.

Morning Glory Cafe is a hidden gem in the middle of south Phoenix.  While sitting in the cafe or garden waiting to be seated (it can be a while) the sounds of bird song fills the air and enticing aromas from the kitchen flow by teasing your nose and creating thoughts on what culinary delights will soon be filling your belly.    The service has always been exceptional and the servers will always make sure you have a good experience.  One person that stands out in my mind as an example of how to keep things running smoothly is Cliff, he is the best!  He keeps the place cruising along at an unhurried, yet efficient pace with a calmness that is at the core of the experience The Farm offers.    Give it a try if you haven't and keep coming back if you have.  This place is great for biking, bringing your well behaved dogs and just spending some quality time with family or friends.

Have been here a number of times over the years and it's been constantly good.  I always get sushi and sushi rolls so I can't say anything about the other dishes.  The fish has always been fresh and well prepared.  The rolls are consistently good.    Always a crowd, be prepared to wait.  Get it to go if you want to enjoy the goodness in your own home!    Service has always been good with friendly hosts and servers.   BYOB/W is great since restaurants tend to mark up the booze so much.  Gets loud inside, but that's how it goes.

I completely agree with the first reviewer that the decor is great and the Gelato is very, very good.  However; I will disagree on the review of the coffee.  Coffee is meant to be taken in hot and this coffee spot makes it the way it should be made.  When traveling throughout Europe I have never had an iced coffee except for the rare Starbucks we have seen.  Their coffee drink selection is superb and the presentation of the different drinks is top notch.  Also, their breakfast sandwiches and other desserts are delightful.  The service has always been fantastic and it is always a special treat for us to stop in for a snack.

I've given Cien Agaves three chances now and they just haven't provided me with anything that makes me to try them again.  I've had the veggie tacos, the fish tacos, chips, salsa, beer and the chips, salsa and beer were pretty good.  This past visit the service was good so that raised it to two stars.  If you are a friend of mine and you want me to come to a happy hour or lunch, do not pick this restaurant.

I have driven by this location numerous times and would try to remind myself to go there when out with friends, but just never seemed to get around to it...until last week!  This location serves up the same great food as the other locations, but isn't as busy.  I will definitely come back.    If you are looking for the atmosphere of the one on Central, you won't find it.  It's more like the one in Mesa, but even toned down a bit compared to that one.  Go for the food!!!  The service was great and everyone is just as friendly so what are you waiting for?  Get in there and eat some food!

I take my dog to this dog park quite often and the park is large enough so the dogs aren't crowded together, people can throw balls, dogs can run at full speed and there are plenty of poop cans, poop bags, pooper scoopers and places to sit for the humans who hang out while their dogs play.  One of the reviews mentioned that there were quite a few dogs who liked to hump other dogs.  Unfortunately my dog will occasionally pick out a dog who he feels he needs to show who is boss, but this is fairly rare.  Dogs will do this, not sure if it is a dog park thing, just a dog thing.  It's up to the responsible dog parent to curb this behavior.  I do.  People are usually very good about cleaning up their pups poop, but there are plenty of us who are willing to grab a pooper scooper, wander the grass and rocks to keep the place clean.  If you are there sitting while your dog is playing, get off your butt, get some exercise and help keep the place clean.   Also, some dog parents will walk the path around the park and expect their dog(s) to stick with them.  This is a dog park, let your pooch run FREE and let them play and be a dog.  Let them have one place where you aren't screaming their name and telling them what to do. Just my opinion. :-)  There is one chocolate lab who loves to come over and act like he wants you to pet him, then he'll raise his leg and attempt to pee on you.  I have actually seen him jump up onto a person and pee on them.  WTF?  I've never seen the pet parent ever try and stop this behavior, but he/she should.  If this is your chocolate Lab, please try and get him to stop doing this to people. Gross.

After searching for decent Indian food in the Phoenix area I was introduced to The Dhaba a few years ago and it restored my faith that good Indian cuisine could actually be prepared in the valley.  I stick to the vegetarian dishes and have yet to be disappointed.  The staff is always friendly, the restaurant clean and the music fun.  Once in a while there will be videos playing on the flat screen above the bar, but normally just some good music.  I will update this review after eating there this weekend!

SideBar is one of my favorite places to go downtown (near downtown) and either there is something going on or there are enough people to provide the perfect atmosphere for almost any mood.  We were there this past Friday with a large group of people and the staff handled our size really well and with a smile.  The owner is a great guy and will go out of his way to make sure that everyone is satisfied with their evening (or day).    I absolutely recommend SideBar to an after dinner drink - You can walk up from Pei Wei below - and have a great evening within a few thousand square feet.

I drive by this car wash almost everyday to and from work and thought, "Hey, I should go check that cool looking place out."  I am glad that I did and at $14 a month I get to wash my car as often as I want and use the free vacuums.  The staff is helpful and friendly, the property well managed and the vacuums actually have great suction.    Bring your own SHAM WOW to wipe down the water that the dryer doesn't get and you are set!

I had to use this dealership due to the extended warranty in place on my Toyota.  They did not seem concerned about getting my vehicle fixed in a timely manner when I spoke to them on the phone.  Then, when I picked up my car the service manager told me that they had washed my car, but by the looks of it they had only smeared dirty water around.  The drip rail on the top of the car is missing and there is a missing plastic grommet in the engine compartment.  Why would they take that drip rail? If they missed the grommet which is in plain view I am wondering what was missed in the engine itself.  This work has me very concerned and I haven't received a return call from the sales manager concerning the missing grommet or drip rail.  I hope this gets resolved soon.

I have left three voice messages with the service person (Jacob) after the other service people who answer the phone tell me that he is there and at his desk.  I asked him to please call me back, that I would pay for the drip rail ($51) and I just want the plastic screw/grommets put back in my car.  No response.  )The plastic screws are about $.10 each.) Tomorrow I will call his manager.  This is the worst customer service I have experienced in years.

Back up to two stars.  I finally received a call back from Nissan.  I was told that they would reimburse me for the missing parts.  I went to Camelback Toyota (my usual dealership) and picked up the parts so we'll see if I get reimbursed. Still not happy with this dealership and would not recommend them.

Average food for an average price.  Nothing great and even though they do have vegetarian options their food hits me hard after a few hours.  I need to remind myself of this fact before thinking, "Chipotle is right there, let's get some".  No.

I've stopped in a few times over the past year and have always had good service.  The coffee is good, the selection of breakfast food covers both veggie and meat options and there has always been enough seating.  This past Saturday morning while picking up a coffee and snack I remembered that I was out of coffee at home.  Instead of making another stop on my way home I just purchased a bag of their locally roasted coffee.  Not sure how old the coffee is, but I think that they need to make sure old coffee is replaced.  The beans were so dry that I might as well have bought Folgers.    I'll be back for drinks and snacks, but won't buy anymore beans.

Sola is near my office which is hardly the only reason I visit this wonderful coffee shop, it is the process by which the Sola staff makes the coffee.  The beans are ground right before the coffee is made which makes for a delicious cup of joe.  The staff is friendly, the beans are fresh and the pastries are quite good.  Free wifi is available too!

Lunch - 20100708  Rice Bowl goodness - Kirstin recommended the Rice Bowl and it was really delicious.  The veggies had a fresh picked taste and the cashews were a perfect match when mixed with the rice. I really enjoyed my lunch (again) and look forward to trying the cucumber soup next week.  For dessert I ordered the apple pie to go.  Unfortunately I didn't heat it up as recommended, but it was still good. Definitely eat the pie warm!    See you next time!

Went back today to try the Watermelon Soup.  It was very good and actually would also be great as a martini.  For the price ($4) there should be more, but what is there is very refreshing and tasty.  I also had the mac'n cheese which was presented in a litter bigger bowl than the soup and was great tasting, but did require a little salt & pepper.  I rarely add s&p so this told me that it was missing "something".  Not sure what, but it needed a little zing and it just wasn't there.    Next week I WILL get the Nutella dessert that sounded so wonderful, but they were out of the crust. FAIL.  Next time there better be crust or star ratings will begin to fall.  Great environment, different tunes today (country?), but we survived.

Today I went with a few coworkers to Nourish and we had the Salmon burger, Teriyaki Burger and the Herb Chicken Sandwich if I remember correctly.  I hadn't had the salmon burger before and will likely get it in the future.  Very good sandwich.  My coworker who had the Teriyaki burger said it was good, but he likes the southwest burger better (VERY GOOD) and the coworker who had the Herb Chicken said it "kicked ass".    The lunch was good as always and Kirstin's presence always makes for a fun time.  She is great fun and seems like a very nice person who enjoys running a restaurant.

Singapore Rice Noodles. That is all you need to know. So good!  Sort of a hole in the wall place, but the food is worth the drive and visit. You won't regret it!

Great and fast service, tasty hummus, strong drinks makes a great place to stop if you are in a hurry before seeing a moving.  We stopped in to Brick about 30 minutes before the movie started, ordered some hummus and a couple drinks.  It wasn't a difficult order to get in a hurry, but the bartender made sure things got to us quickly and got our check right away so we wouldn't have to wait.  The hummus came with great add-ons - cucumbers, olives, onions, pita bread, etc. and was sweeter than most hummus we've had, but was so delicious.  The food we saw coming out for others looked delicious so we'll definitely be back for more.  Thanks!

I was in a bind and needed to find a landscaping / lawn service quickly.  Yelp to the rescue!  A quick search lead me to AMS Landscaping where I left a message on a Friday that was quickly returned by Eli who setup a crew for the coming Monday.    The crew was at my home around 1pm, we walked around the property discussing what needed to be done and as soon as a price was determined and agreed upon the crew got to work.  The three person crew worked very quickly and efficiently with great attention to detail.  When they were done the crew lead walked me around the property again to make sure it was completed to my satisfaction.  It was!    If you need a company that shows up when expected, responds promptly, performs brilliantly and prices reasonably I would recommend AMS.  Thanks for the great work!  I wish my HOA would have AMS cleaning our community!  See you next time.

Heavy sauce, mediocre shrimp, good and friendly service. Do not think I will go back after two other friends said that they felt as bad as I did after eating there.  The only reason it has two stars is due to the excellent service.

I have a coworker in from out of town and we all normally go out and try new places while he is in town.  The Herb Box was recommended by another coworker who hadn't been here, but had heard good things.  I had the trout entree and it was quite flavorful, flaky - but not too dry and was the perfect size.  Trout should be cooked simply (take note Green House) and my favorite way is cooked in a pan with butter, salt, pepper and lemon.  That is it!  While this entree when a bit beyond they did not ruin it the way Green House does.  I would definitely get it again.  My coworkers had the short ribs (=great) and the regular ribs (=excellent).  I am a pescatarian so I abstain from the land loving meats, but their dishes did smell great.  One BIG recommendation is the Gouda Mac 'n Cheese!  AMAZINGLY good.   The service was excellent and the location was great.  We all sat along the walking path by the water and it was very nice.  Great place to take a lady friend or any friend.

Herb Box has a new dish called "Vegan Nosh" and I definitely recommend it.  Very fresh and very tasty.   Our service today was extremely slow even though the restaurant was not too busy.  This will not dissuade me from returning, but it did reduce the tip.  No apologies for being slow, nothing.  This is not the service I usually receive from this establishment.

Great fresh food. The rolls on the front of the menu are excellent!! I've only had the vegetable pho (veghead) and that was really delicious too!  Great selection of drinks at the bar and a very friendly staff.    I will definitely return and will recommend to friends.

Nasty pizza and good service do not equal 5 stars.

First time trying Kokoro and the last time.  I wanted some ramen and who can mess that up?  I had the shrimp ramen and it just didn't taste right, the shrimp seemed off.  I didn't eat more than the first, but stuck to just the noodles.  I won't get too detailed, but very soon after eating I knew for sure that something was wrong with what I had eaten. I will not be going back.

Unbelievably slow service, do not go here for lunch if want to get back on time, servers do not care about service.

Great place. Good food, good booze selection and fast service.  Friends had told me about Umami but I never got around to trying it. Wish I hadn't waited!

Been doing this for about 6 years and it gets worse each hash.  I'm not sure why I keep coming back... Maybe it's the crappy beer?  The sh*tty trails? The horrible songs? The flour and chalk? The low batteries in my head(!)lamp that causes me to fall often (probably in combination with the beer)? I don't know...perhaps a few more and I'll have it figured out, but as a half-mind I'm sure it will remain a mystery and I just need to keep coming.

Have been here a few times and have loved it every time!  Great food, great beer selection, great patio! Please support this restaurant! They support our running group's activities throughout the year and we plan on going back as often as possible.

Chips & Salsa were good.  Fish tacos - unsure of the fish they used or if it was just old, heavily breaded with too much mayo.  Wish they had a sauteed option.  Won't be going back. Should have had a discussion with them since they are a new establishment, but I needed to get back to work.

I've been eating at Classic Italian for years and was so glad to hear they reopened near Guadalupe and McClintock.  The food is good, the service is good! Where are all of the people?! Eat here!

Started eating hear about a month ago and it's been great every time.  I was just there this morning after an appointment and it's a great place to enjoy a good cup of coffee, some delicious food and decent people watching.   Everyone is always very friendly and helpful.  Food wait times are minimal and the food is delicious.  I haven't had any of the meat items so I can't vouch for that, but everything non-meat having has been superb. Enjoy.

Very good food, good atmosphere, good service. Stated $$, but I'd go with $$$. $105 for two people is not $$. Not sure if I'll go back, was good, but not $100 good.

Rage Cycles is the best.  They have come through for me when other bike shops fail.  This is now the ONLY place I will take my bikes.  Their quality of service is excellent and they get the work done fast.  I recommend them to everyone!
