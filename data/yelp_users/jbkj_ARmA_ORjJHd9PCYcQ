I am very impressed with the Arizona Grand resort and spa. We stayed for one night in the mountainside rooms and it was perfect. Check in was fast and easy. I asked valet to show me the direction of my room and he got in his car and drove all the way around the property to show me--very nice and courteous!!  We ordered room service the next morning and something went wrong with our bill so the restaurant manager on duty took complete ownership of the situation and exceeded our expectations of it. I would absolutely recommend friends and family to stay at this resort, it was well worth it!

Ah-some!!!! The food was delicious, and the table-side grill show was incredible! The chef is really interactive with the table which makes it all worth it! I only have it 4 stars because I felt the chicken could have been better but it was an amazing dinner and great show!

The place was awesome! All the food was right on point. We ordered appetizers, and dinner, each meal was perfectly spaced out. Even the side salad was delicious. You can really see how much the owners are involved and care about their business! Way better than a boring chain restaurant.

The food was great and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich and I will definitely go back again to order that! The side potatoes weren't great, I ended up ordering another side because I really didn't like them. The employees were all nice and professional. The manager was kind of rude and snappy--she kept barking at the workers and ordering them around. But overall good experience!

The only reason why I gave this place 2 stars is because the food was good and it was a nice place.  However the customer service is AWFUL. When we walked in, no one was there to greet us, waited at least a minute for a kitchen person to ring us up. He didn't take off his kitchen gloves while working the resister, and he didn't not change his gloves when he went back to working in the kitchen.  While ringing us up, we asked a couple questions, in which he didn't know any answers.  While eating, we noticed other customers enter and we overheard the same worker complaining about having to ring up more guests and that he didn't want to.  Another customer complained to some chick who was stirring sauces that whoever cuts the pizza clearly doesn't know how to do it because it sucked. You can barely tear off a piece without touching all the other pieces.  More customers walked in and had to wait over 2 minutes before someone took their order (I timed it).  I do not recommend this place to anyone because customer service was absolutely awful. Just a bunch of teenagers who didn't want to be there or slightly care about cleanliness and customer service.

The menu has amazing options and the food was incredible! All the appetizers that we ordered were delicious and perfectly cooked. I recommend getting the fried pickles and the fried onion strings--those were phenomenal! I ordered a burger that was delicious and perfectly cooked, even the bun was awesome! We ordered milkshakes too and they tasted amazing. Our server Isaiah did a fantastic job! He was very nice, professional, and attentive. Even a manager came by to check on us and asked if we were satisfied. I highly recommend this place!
