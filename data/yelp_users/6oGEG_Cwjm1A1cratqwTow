My husband and I ate at the Siamese Cat for the first time last night. I am very disappointed in all the dishes we ordered.  When trying a new Thai restaurant for the first time, my husband I always get our favorite dishes. We ordered Laab Gai, chicken satay, phad kee Mao (drunken noodles) and phad bai kra prao. It's a lot of food but like most Asians, we like variety in our meal.   The satay came out first and it was ok. Nothing memorable- you could taste a hint of the curry power but not much. The peanut sauce was super oily.   Next was the Laab - I had high hopes for this because it usually is always good everywhere I go but this dish was much too salty.  The noodle dish was the worst dish. The noodles were really hard.  I could tell they did not warm up the noodles enough before cooking it. Also, there was no flavor to this dish at all. A big disappointment as phad kee Mao is always flavorful with the sauce and basil.   Lastly the stirfry tasted nothing like what it should have tasted like. It was a typical stir fry and it was quite dry.   Overall we phad 33 for everything so the food was cheap. The service is better than most Asian restaurants so we tipped our waitress well.  Sadly, we will not return because not one dish we ordered was anything near our expectations.

A few months ago my husand and I moved into the neighborhood near Landis Cyclery on Warner. My husband was really excited to see that we had a local bike shop nearby and paid them a visit for brake pads. As a supporter of local bike shops, he placed a special order with them knowing well in advance that he could have purchased the product online for a better deal and same delivery. The employee who helped him was named Bob.  When the product arrived a week later, my husband went to pick it up and upon returning home and opening the box, my husband realized that Bob had ordered him the wrong part. When he returned to the store, Bob tried to look up the right part but told us that no one made the brake pads my husband needed. He then suggested that my husband buy new brakes. After hearing this, my husband decided to return the product for a full refund which made Bob upset. He became very rude and told my husband that he was going to charge my husband a 20% restocking fee since the box was opened. After they exchanged a few words, Bob eventually gave my husband his full refund. This was the worst service we have EVER seen.   We will never support this bike shop again. Rude customer service. Also, my  husband found the brake pads he needed at REI.

My husband and I ate here twice. The first time, my husband was very pleased with his plate of albacore. Each piece was thick and tasty.   Last night we gave this restaurant a second try and was not thrilled. I ordered chicken teriyaki for $8 and could not eat it. The chicken was so dry and the food was cold when it came out. To be honest, I thought the chicken was precooked and reheated/sauced to order. The rice was hard and dry as well. My husband order a plate of albacore again. The pieces were much thinner than last but he said it tasted good. He mentioned that kabuki restaurant definitely gives more for the money than sushi 101. I don't think we will be coming back.   As for service, it was ok. Nothing special.

Pho is great although it hasn't been consistent lately.  My husband ordered some spicy chicken wings and that was tasty. The service is ok. This place is our top pick for pho.

Wow! What a RUDE staff! We were the only ones at the counter and the staff ignored us. My husband then had to ask if they were still serving! RUDE RUDE RUDE!! Anyway, we got our coffee and will not return to this location. This was during the evening.

Went to see adventure club perform at this night club and it was insane!! I like that there are multiple areas to get drinks. The space is small and on that specific night, it was super packed. I don't know if I would go here if it was a local dj spinning but I do keep an eye out for their special events. Tickets were only 15 a person. My recommendation for the company is to have a seperate line for folks who purchase tickets ahead of time.

Came to this location on a Saturday night. It was pretty dead with a few customers. The bartender was really nice and we told him it was our first time there. We ordered chips and salsa with a martini and beer. The chips were great but the martini tasted like juice so we decided to order two shots of my favorite grey goose vodka to get the alcohol kicking.   Things got awkward quickly because the shots tasted like water with a hint of alcohol. My husband hesitated on saying anything because we hate complaining but it was pretty disappointing.  When the bartender came by, my husband politely told him that he isn't trying to say that it was the bartenders fault but the shots we got tasted like water. The bartender immediately got annoyed. He just shrugged his shoulders and said he poured us shots and left it at that. My husband even said that he understands it's probably not the bartenders fault and that we didn't want anything else but thought it would be good for him to know. We've worked in restaurant before and know that sometimes management will water down the bottles. The bartender walked away and we got our check and left after paying.   Unfortunately, we won't be coming back to this place. it was really clear that the staff  had no interest in retaining new customers who were excited about finding a new place to enjoy their weekends.   When I worked in the restaurant business, I alway made sure that first time customers would be a returning customer. Our shots were $9/shot and that's pretty expensive when you feel like you drank water.

My husband and I eat here weekly. After long work days, this is a great alternative to cooking dinner. The food is affordable and good. Most days, I order their roasted hen which comes with rice, a couple slices of cucumber, and a lime sauce ($6.50). The hen is very well cooked - not dry and very juicy. It's also becoming my husband's favorite.  On off days, I would order their pho ($7 - $8). It isn't the best pho I've had but it's not the worst either (you guys know that taste where it tastes like fake pho? lol, I'm not sure how to explain it). Anyway, the grilled pork spring rolls always taste very fresh ($3). Their service isn't bad either. The waiters/waitresses are super friendly and will chat with you . I would recommend this place for folks who want affordable good Vietnamese food.

I've never eaten here but have been here for the drinks and music. This place is always beyond packed so my husband and i decided to check it out. It's a nice venue with nice staff. What I don't care for is the music. If you love top 40s, then this is your place to be.

Great picture menu. Ramen wasn't bad. Sushi has always been tasty and the presentation is beautiful. My husband and I sit in the bar and we always get good service from the bartenders. Best cucumber martini in phx. This is a restaurant we would take family and friends to if they visit.

Great Pho but I don't tip at this place. I found out a while ago from a few workers there that the owners take the tip from the servers. One worker went on to say that even if I tried and put the money in their apron, they would still get in trouble if they don't give it to the owners. There are cameras everywhere. I thought that was kind of sad..so I rate this place a 2 star for good pho but bad business pratice.   So remember to not tip!

First time eating here, the food was exceptional! Pho was the best I've had in long time along with the egg rolls! To top if off, the prices were super low! If I didn't live so far, I would definitely be a regular.

Ordered Togo for the first time and the pho was disgusting. I had to throw it out. Very disappointed and will not go back.

If you are looking for a place that would meet the needs of different people in a large group setting, this is a great place. They provide expensive bowling with cool tv screens, a dance floor, mini arcade and pool. My first time here was a few months ago when I was invited to a birthday party in the VIP area of the bowling alley. The service we received was horrible. My friend who had spent the money for her husband's birthday was very upset and mentioned a few times that it was a complete waste of her money. In fact, we didn't receive any kind of service - while our waitress was somewhere else, the guys ended up going to the bar and getting all their drinks that way.   I think this place has a cool concept and I wouldn't rule it out completely but I definitely think they should teach their employees the basics of customer service.

I hate that I have to give this place below average because the staff was super nice but I must.  My husband and I purchased NYE tickets that costed us about $70. We had never been to this place but heard good things so we were really excited to see what it was all about.   The interior was definitely not what I expected. It was really small--seemed even smaller than wild knight. The decoration looked older which threw me off-it definitely added to the ghettoness of the club. The drink prices were reasonable and the bartenders were fast to serve. There's no seating unless you purchase a table or sit at a counter located near the bar.   This may be more of a critique on the dj than the club but the music was really bad. My husband and I enjoy electro music and the music just did not hit the spot for us. We eventually left Smashboxx to wild knight and paid another $100 entrance fee there for better music.   I wouldn't go back to this club unless i knew the music was good.

My first time at this club was on Halloween. I went to see NERVO!! What I really liked about the place is it's use of the space. I would never purchase a VIP table at the other clubs but I can see how it would be worth it at Maya!   They have two bars that I noticed - 1 was located inside and the second was outside. During Halloween, it was a bit chilly outside so all the heaters were turned up which made a big difference. Also, they have poolside lounge chairs for anyone to sit which was a plus. The energy was absolutely crazy when Nervo came out! Everyone was trying to get close to them and me being so small, I couldn't see! People were standing behind all the VIP tables which made it worst- all I could see were the phone cameras in the air. LOL - Other than that, it was an epic night! I hope to bring my friends from out of town to this place in December so PLEASE...bring in an awesome artist for a Saturday night! :)  And it's my birthday today! Send me to see Markus Schultz! :)
