I needed to get my passport photo taken and remembered that AAA does it. Because I have an upgraded membership, it is a FREE service. As soon as I walked in and was checked in by the concierge, they were ready to shoot. They even offered to reshoot the photo if I did not like it. The prints were ready in minutes and in a handy little carrier. Overall, amazing customer service and experience which I have come to expect from AAA. Well done!

I love, love, love the restaurant, the food and most of the staff at Otaku, but there are times when they make mistakes on the order or the service is slow ... glad they finally redid their menu so it is not so huge (I mean size, not number of items). PS: Whatever that pineapple mojito type drink they have is SO yummy too!

By far the most polite, customer service oriented contractor I have dealt with on my bathroom remodel. They do a quality job, show up when they say they will and only deal with quality products. I am extremely happy with the end results. They redid the glass for my walk in shower and cut custom beveled mirrors for my vanity, installed both, and it looks amazing. They spent the time to help determine the right size of the mirrors and the bevel and were right on. Lastly, there was concern about there not being a lip on the step out of the shower so they offered to install a brushed metal (matching the rest of the bathroom's trim) "bump" as an added measure to make sure water stayed where it belongs. They did it as a complimentary gesture and it was much appreciated.I would hit them again in a second. If there was any constructive criticism at all, I would have liked it if there was not a service charge for using a credit card. BUT, I will say it was my choice to do so -- I could have paid by cash or check and saved the fee.

We ate here once and the food was terrible but the service was passible. Fast Forward a year or so and my husband took my daughter and I here one night because they were looking for a sports pub-like atmosphere for wings and pizza. After nearly an hour of waiting for ANY of their food order to show, my husband called me from the place and asked if I thought they should leave. I told them to yes, walk out after letting the server know. He said it was not crowded at all and they just left. Upon telling the server why they were leaving, the server told him this is just how long it took there. No offer to comp dinner, no telling him it would be just a moment longer, nothing. Just gave up on the spot. We will never eat there again. Not worth it. I have no idea how they stay in business.

I sent my daughter who is 5 here with a friend for their week long Spring Break camp. We had been here once for a birthday party and I thought they did a good job and the friend had positive experiences with her older kids. The reason the girls signed up together was because the friend's mom was going to be across the country tending to serious medical issues with another older sibling and dad works, so carpooling was key. When I walked in to drop the girls off the first day, the women behind the desk quickly passed me off to the teen-aged kids running the camp. I checked them in (gave their names) and asked them about changing a name on the pick up list they requested in their paperwork. I wanted to include the babysitter of my friend so she could pick them up the next afternoon and keep them at their house until my work was over at 5:30 PM. The women at the front desk had me hand write out a note to include in my daughter's file supposedly. The next day went without a hitch -- my daughter got picked up.  Wednesday was a field trip day and my friend and I miscommunicated via text (remember she is far away!) and the sitter did not pick up my daughter as planned. I arrived at the friend's house for pickup to be told by the sitter that she did NOT pick her up -- she was told not to today (again misunderstanding -- totally our fault and not the gym). HOWEVER, the gym was in possession of a note from me that said she WAS picking my daughter up FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK. Not one person questioned the sitter when she left without my daughter. They never called anyone of us to ask -- they just shuffled her to aftercare, which I never signed up for or paid for, which should have a been a sign on its own! Basically they were so complacent that they would have let anyone walk out with any kid if the kid would have left willingly. They were unaffected by the fact that my 5-year-old sat for two hours when they could have called me to come get her. After discussing it with one of the people on the phone on the way to the gym (in my panic to make sure was there since they didn't call I wasn't sure), when I got there not one person apologized or even tried to explain. They sent me upstairs to a room where my 5 year old girl was sitting on the floor watching some kids show with an older teen boy BY HERSELF. He was clueless and again did not apologize or offer any explanation. Though I asked for a phone call back from the camp director, no one ever called me back or mentioned the issue again. I begrudgingly brought my daughter back for the last day (I had to work and the friend was in tears without her) and no word -- they just don't care. They have so many people, you are just a number. They do not engage or get to know the kids. They did not care that my friend's daughter cried every time I dropped her off. I would never send my kids here for anything ever again. AWFUL EXPERIENCE.

I am a huge fan of this location and the menu. The manager is often in the store and the one time I brought a friend and she did not like her sub, her remade it for her on the spot and she said it was fabulous. They handle big crowds easily, the space is clean and well thought out, the bread and meat is always fresh -- never that chipped, pressed stuff you get at like a Firehouse subs. I have had both hot and cold sandwiches and they do both fabulously. And I love the seasoning that is included when you order "Mike's Way" -- it is not something I would think I would love, but it is awesome on cold subs. On your first visit they give you a free cookie, which makes kids so happy! I think by keeping the menu classic and simple, they keep the quality high. Two things I do wish would change: I am not a fan of Pepsi, so I wish they would get new drinks and I think their chip selection is sort of odd, but I rarely order them, so that is a good thing.

We had an excellent experience with Sam and Cloud 9. They over-delivered on all counts, especially customer service. Their technicians were polite, skilled and fast. The job was competitively priced and we are very pleased with the work -- windows spotless! Our screens were so dirty we thought they were brown and barely let light through -- now they are black again! Very pleased with the results. We would recommend them highly and would use their services again.

I have been blessed (haha) to have been crawled on by scorpions twice (once years ago, different house before we met you guys and once last week in present home) and never stung. YUK!!!!!!! Thanks for coming out to spray so quickly this week. Whatever you did seems to have worked beautifully because we went out with a black light tonight and there was NO SIGN of any more friends. With two neighbors behind us doing major yard work and us putting in all new flooring and moving stuff around, this is AMAZING. Yet, it is not that big of a surprise as you have been spraying for us since before you became "Vintage." We now feel very safe and secure once again in our home! Thanks so much for all you do!
