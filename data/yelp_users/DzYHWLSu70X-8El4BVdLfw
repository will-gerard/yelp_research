WORST eyebrow wax I have ever had. I believe the tech's name was Logan but left in shock. My eyebrows were completely off making my face look crooked. After this horrible result, I had to go to makeup artist for them to fill them in. Several people have noticed and commented about them. Will NEVER give them business again.

The most pathetic chipotle for online ordering. Rarely ever gets an order right. Consistently forgets to put lettuce in a salad order.

Great location and friendly service! I love taking my dog here. The food isn't the best but the beer and ambiance make up for it.

A simple gel polish manicure turned into two hours because of the technician doing a sloppy job. WAY Below par customer service and was still charged $46 (again a two hour simple gel polish). This was my second really disappointing experience with this salon.

Best waxing and sugaring I have ever had. Beautiful location and reasonable prices! First time I have made an appointment on the spot for my next wax to make sure I get in. Would recommend anyone to check this place out.
