I love this place...best pizza in Phoenix- hands down! Wings are amazing, service is always phenomenal. I simply love this restaurant. I have to admit that I may be a bit biased as this place holds a lot of sentimental value to me. My family and I have eaten here for years and years. At this point- 4 generations worth, that I know for sure, have dined at and loved Red Devil. My husbands favorite is the sausage and artichoke pizza- while mine is the Red Devil combo. We always split an order of medium wings and get bigger then we know we will eat- pizza so we can have some to bring home.   This restaurant also does well balancing the "family friendly" with the "date night" crowds. I will say that we live much closer to the Mesa (Tempe?) location and have gone there 4-5 times...completely not the same. Yes, same-ish food, but the other location just simply does not have it like the McDowell one. Dont waste your time at the other one- just go to the McDowell location and enjoy!

Go hungry! This place has THE BEST Mexican food in Arizona. Hands down. Yes, it is in a bad part of town. Yes the place looks like a total $#!% hole. But the food makes up for it 100000%.   No matter what you order, I promise you will not be disappointed. However, if you do order a burrito, order it double-wrapped. And do yourself a favor and get a order of the fresh tortillas to go. Amazing! At $3/dozen you will not be sorry.   I am torn on this one issue though....would I want this place to re-locate to a better area? Remodel to improve the atmosphere? I dont know...I feel like if they did it may get even more popular and then Id be annoyed.

We buy chicken feed here all the time. They are always well stocked and prices are very reasonable. I have no idea why other guy said that about gravel road/hard to get there. Yes, this is a small site but supper easy to find and right off broadway.

My family and I love Sweet Cakes- such a treasure in downtown Mesa! The food is well thought out and simply delicious. My favorites are the Turkey Delight sandwich, Cinnamon Rolls, and the Scochteroos. The cafe is cute and always very clean. I would love to see this cafe grow with a larger menu.

Food is pretty good and you won't leave hungry. Some of the waitresses are a little slow and clearly aren't listening to you when you order. The waiting area needs to be expanded as well. On a busy morning you can have 20 people shoved in this little corner. Plus more people coming in. Some people are trying to pay and some are trying to get a table. I think this could easily be solved by letting people pay their server.  I highly recommend the banana nut pancakes!

We had to bring our sweet 14 ye old Rottie mix in. We had never used this facility but it was late on a Friday and our regular vet was not going to be able to see him until Monday morning. We knew he couldn't wait to be seen so we went in. The staff was so kind and the doctor really took his time with us explaining all our options. Sadly, we ended up putting our baby boy down. I will never forget their compassion and kindness. In the end it was very inexpensive. When we went back to pick up our dogs cremated remains we were pleasantly surprise that they took a clay cast of his paw print for us. Free of charge. Its those little things that make a difference. Thanks!

We rent a violin for our son here and have come in several times for other supplies and tune ups on our guitar. Everyone we have worked with have been super knowledgeable and they don't talk down to me for not being a non-musical noob. I really do appreciate that. The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because they regularly have issues with their check-out system. The credit card machine goes down, takes forever... Kinda a pain in the butt. But overall, typically a great experience.

Eww. Just eww. Based on the previous Yelp reviews I was expecting mediocre, at best. However the food at this place was just gross. Add that to the horrible service- we wont be back.   There was 4 of us in our party, we were seated right away. I ordered iced tea to drink and it was so gross- clearly old and had gone bad. It was all downhill from there. Our four orders were taken correctly but 3/4 orders came out after about 45 mins. The 4th order took almost an entire hour to come to the table. Now, to be fair- if the restaurant was busy or the food was amazingly good- Im okay with the wait. However, the restaurant was not busy at all- and yes, the other reviews are correct- it looks like heaven's waiting room in there. Apparently the elderly like gross food. The servers brought out items and placed each plate, without any communication, at the center of the table. So, we were left guessing what items belonged to which order. There was never a refill on drinks, never a check back to the table to see if we liked the food, nothing. The only time we saw our server again was when she tossed the check on the table and walked away.

This place is small and jam packed with sports attire. I had to take some deep breaths to keep my claustrophobia in check when I walked in. However...  We came here to pick up our kids swim team swim suits for this season. When we walked in I first looked for someone who worked there to see if they knew exactly what suit we were supposed to get as it didn't say on the registration form (the reg for just directed us to this store). I didn't see anyone past the jam-packed store opening. I went off to the side and started looking through the swim suits to see if I could see anything directing us to what we needed...no luck. My husband spotted someone at a counter towards the middle of the store so I went to ask about the designated swimsuits my kids needed. The guy working was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about what my kids needed (size, how it should fit, care of the suits, etc). He was patient with us and didn't waste our time- we were in and out in less than 20 mins. While he went to the back to get a different size for one of my kids another sales associate came and asked if I needed any help, so that was nice. She was also very friendly and I noticed the next person she went to, she was helpful to them and did a great job answering the other customers questions as well.   I should also add that once I got more acquainted with the store I noticed small stickers on the shelves next to the boxes of swimsuits that told which team they were for. Helpful...if I knew to look in that area. They supply so many teams with their uniforms- Mesa, Gilbert, Tempe. It would be really great if they could open another store that isn't so far into east Mesa.   The store was busy, everyone getting their swim gear for the season, and with it being the only place to buy this stuff it felt a little crazy dropping over $60 for 2 swimsuits so I really hope they last all season. With the tips the sales guy gave, they should ... hopefully.   East Valley Sports is a great resource for sporting attire and the sales staff is very kind and  helpful. I would probably give 5 stars if the store was a bit more organized and if a sales associate would have looked for us in the beginning versus us having to look for him. Especially since we had to make sure we had a very specific swimsuit. Overall, great place!

I am not a big fan of desert camping but if you are going to do it, this is the place! Usery is very clean and well maintained with a surprising amount of amenities and things to do. There is lots of hiking options, an archery range, guided scorpion hunts, night hikes, and very clean bathrooms with flushing toilets and showers.   We have taken the archery 101 class with our kids and the scorpion hunt--both of my boys loved these and they learned a lot from Ranger B. If you have the class to do anything with him, DO IT! He is incredibly knowledgeable, does a great job teaching to every age, and is so funny. Seriously, this guy is fantastic and I hope he stays working at Usery forever! :)  The nature center is a cute little shop with lots of trinkets to buy at reasonable prices. The people working in there are very nice and helpful.   As a tip: book early. If you plan on staying there for more than 1 night anywhere outside of the hot summer months, book WAY ahead. Like, even a year in advance. They book fast. Especially if you are going with a large group.  Im not sure if Usery has a noise ordnance- or quiet hours-  but I wish that if they did that it was more strictly adhered to. I know people l like to get out of town and make noise and have fun. And that people camp differently- some like noise, some dont- But numerous times we have been out there and anywhere from 10:30pm-1am there can be some large parties still going on. Luckily for me, Im a heavy sleeper and I just bring ear plugs.   All-in-all a great park and a must visit place in the outskirts of the valley.

My husband has brought my sons here on their "man dates" and they all kept raving about it so I gave it a shot. As much as they raved I assumed this was a sit down restaurant. I was surprised this was "fast food"! We got an order of the famous cheese curds and some burgers. The food was all good and for our family of 4 it was about $35. PLUS, the kids all get free frozen custard with their meals. The staff was super friendly and I could definitely see us all coming back. The food didn't seem like fast food quality at all... much better!   Check in on Yelp and get a free scoop of frozen custard!

We were so happy when this HD opened up. My husband is a carpenter/contractor and is constantly running to Home Depot. He isn't always thrilled with the staff here, hard to find someone who can actually help and not just go to "find someone else", but overall good place.

I can't stand how this Walmart never has enough registers open and the employees all look at you like you are some major inconvenience to them. The site-to-store: nightmare. One register, you have to call for help- they disappear to the back for no less than 10 mins- and one two occasions I've picked up my items and they were damaged. Walmart is horrible. After my experiences this Christmas season... Never again. I'm done. Buy local and boycott Walmart.

This place is by far, my favorite coffee shop. Atmosphere is great, staff is wonderful, coffee and food is amazing! I also found out that the staff is 100% volunteer and ALL proceeds go to good causes. Can't beat that!

I way prefer SA to Walmart(I've boycotted Walmart at this point-see previous reviews), which is in the same plaza. Prices are comparable and sometimes even less that Walmart on some items. I think the shoes are way overpriced though. Even the "clearance" prices are way too high.   I do appreciate that the employees at SA are so willing to help and come up and ask if we need help with anything. However, I will say I wish they stuck to a section or something. We were looking at baseball equipment, just browsing, and we literally had 6 different employees come ask if we needed anything in a 20 min period. At a point I thought we were on hidden camera or something! It was really funny but I can definitely see people being annoyed by that.   Overall, good store- good selection.

We have been going to this vet office for a few years now. Dr. Senter has seen us through several well visits, some hip pain, and now treating on of our pups for hypothyroidism. I cannot express enough how patient, caring, and financially considerate Dr. Senter and the staff are at this office. They always take the time to answer any questions we may have and to give us info on things we may have questions on when we leave the office. My youngest son wants to be a veterinarian when he grows up and Dr Senter has taken time out to show him around and answer give him a better glimpse into the world of veterinary medicine. Fantastic veterinarian office!

This place is a little more then your typical Chillis. They seem to have very little turn over in staff and it shows in the quality of servers. Everyone is very nice and they do a great job. Always clean, always quick with the food, highly recommend. If I could move the entire staff to a non-chain restaurant with great food then they would get all 5 stars.  **Tip** If possible- always, ALWAYS, sit in the bar area. Even with kids. Seriously.

I love this store. It seems to be your typical BB&B but I will say the employees are very kind and helpful. I LOVE when friends do their registry here for weddings. Super easy to find the items they want AND you can wrap their gift for free right there in the store with their super cute wrapping station.   I totally agree with previous reviewer who talked about finding simple things like a butter dish or orange squeezer...maybe not things you "need" but things that are super helpful you cant always find in other stores.   When I visit this store I always pick up a few of the BB&B wax melts and I visit the clearance sections. I always find fantastic deals there. Got an adorable shower curtain for $5 because it was the floor model. Absolutely nothing wrong with it.

I really , really, really wish the Mesa Riverview store was still open but this store is just as good. I mean, its a chain store where they are all pretty much the same, right? The people that work here are nice and helpful. My only complaint is that it is in Tempe Marketplace and the parking sucks. Especially since this is right next to the uber-busy Target.

A little pricey but very excellent instruction. Both my kids went through their programs and loved it. Even after my kids were swimming really well we kept bringing them back because they loved it so much.

We are regulars here because the food is good, staff is super friendly, and well....you can't get that unlimited sushi for that price anywhere else!  edit*** 1/30/13 Okay, we still go to Volcano all the time but the ice cream situation is grossing me out. My kids love ice cream and the "freezer" the ice cream is stored in has a broken glass covered with tape, the freezer either makes the ice cream rock hard or way too melted. Please guys, just get rid of that thing and put in a soft serve machine. You can serve the green tea ice cream in soft serve. PLEASE.

This salon is so hit and miss but lately it is just going downhill.   The prices are reasonable for all the services they offer...IF you get good service. It is sometimes very busy but they are typically really good about getting people in and out of there. Maybe to a fault.   The things I am not thrilled with: The quality of the nail polish- the last few times I was there a good portion of the polish was very think and the rest had been clearly thinned down. To me, that is just being cheap. You are a nail salon- have decent polish! I brought my niece here to treat her to a pedicure and her polish came completely off the next day. We were not doing anything extravagant- just some shopping- and I looked down and noticed on over half her toes the polish was missing. We looked closely at one of the nails that still had polish and it was all pulling up. My polish was completely chipped.   Some of the chairs are broken and have been for awhile.   The techs dress very provocatively. I am not a super conservative person, especially in this Arizona heat- but when I can see all your goods- Im not a fan. I don't care how cute your figure may be, nobody needs to see your ass cheeks hanging out.   The Vietnamese. I get it. It is very nice to speak in your native language. But it is very rude. Maybe it is a cultural thing? Maybe they are just talking trash about their customers? Regardless, it irritates me.   I also don't like that nobody ever introduces themselves or wears a name tag.   All-in-all this salon has all the makings of being a fantastic and very lucrative nail salon. But they have got to quit being cheap with the polishes and broken chairs. They need to tighten up their customer service standards and stop being so complacent about how they treat people.

This place is mediocre, at best. I was so hot in there is was completely uncomfortable. They were cooling the place with swamp coolers during monsoon season....not exactly yet the best idea. The food was okay but the staff was really rude and inattentive.

This place is a favorite for my extended family. My Grandma likes to talk about bringing my mom and uncles to the original location on Fridays when they were kids. For me, the family tradition of La Fonda's adds to the comfort food feel. With all of that said the food here is great. I love the Fundido and the fajitas are great!  The customer service could improve here. The staff used to all be very friendly and talkative. It was very much a family atmosphere. Now, not so much.

Mediocre sandwiches, lame service, dirty restaurant.   It is hard enough as it is to find parking and get a decent table in an Old Town restaurant. I stopped in here because they didn't seem to busy and a cold sandwich sounded good. When I walked in I was the 3rd person in line and the gal taking orders started to get anxious with the older gentleman ordering. By the time I got to the counter there was about 4 people behind me. She was still very nice taking my order but very rushed.   About 10-15 mins after placing my order the rude guy making the sandwiches yelled my name and basically tossed my sandwich tray on the counter in my general direction. Uhhhh...rude.   The seating area itself was cramped for space (which is fine) but the tables were all sticky and had garbage littered all over the place. After seeing that I was turned off at the idea of eating there. I went back up to Mr. Sandwich thrower and asked for a to-go bag. He rolled his eyes at me and handed me a brown bag. Wow. I am so sorry to inconvenience you, jerk face.  I won't be back. Ill just go to a Subway. At least they serve a crap sandwich with a smile and hold the attitude!

I simply love this little store. I always mail my packages out of here and they are ALWAYS super kind and friendly. Prices are very reasonable and they have never tried to up sale me on shipping. They also have some cute trinkets in the store and my favorite Kerusso tshirts. Even when they are busy- I'm still in and out of there fast without feeling rushed.

This place is great! The attendants are always helpful and friendly. The automatic/drive thru car wash does a great job. There are several FREE vacuums that work fantastic.  Prices are very reasonable. Starting at $3 for a very basic wash, spot free rinse, and dry. Prices go up from there but are still very reasonable and customizable. There is a program they offer for unlimited washes by paying a small monthly fee. I haven't taken this offer yet, but might.  They do have signs up that ask that no loud music is played. I greatly appreciate this as I can't stand going to a car wash and hearing 2 or 3 cars competing to see who has the best system.  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because the car wash doesn't always do a good job on my tires/rims. Even when I've paid extra for the tire specific wash/shine.
