So once again, I ordered the wrong thing. I must have. Everyone loves this place, so it must be me. Most Yelp reviews are great (which is why we met there), the people I was with loved their food (a burro & a chimichanga), the various police officers who swiftly came in and out seemed to enjoy their food, but I thought mine sucked! This smarts, particularly because I was so looking forward to eating "good Mexican in a sketchy neighborhood," as I had told my cousin weeks ago was high on the to-do list for our trip to Phoenix.   The barbed wire behind the building, the rugged neighborhood, and the jammed paper towel dispenser in the restroom sure made it seem sketchy enough to be good, but the food disappointed me. So what gives?  Does it serve me right for not ordering off the giant menu on the wall?   I asked if they could make enchiladas verdes and they said yes, so I went for it. The chicken, by the by, was fantastic--very white and tender and it looked great, especially in my cousin's burro, but the sauce on my enchiladas was not green, it was more of a MRSA-discharge yellow. In addition, the sauce was so creamy that it was goopy, it was flavorless, and it was not hot. (Er, it was not hot temperature-wise, nor was it spicy).  My cousin ordered chips and salsa with her burro (an enormous bag), so after I finished picking the chicken out of the enchiladas, I ate some of her chips using my refried beans as a dip. The salsa was good, though, and the kind of spicy that accumulates and sneaks up on you. Also, their pop machine dispenses horchata.  Still, I would not go to Carolina's again.

I had the shrimp tacos, which were fabulous. My mom had the chicken tacos, which were less flavorful than mine. (She also didn't like that she had to put her own lunch together. I thought it was fun and I like to control the condiments, so I was perfectly happy to assemble my tacos).   Very knowledgeable and friendly staff, nice beer list. I haven't eaten in Carefree, but my guess is that it's worth the short drive to head over here for lunch in the middle of a Carefree shopping day!

My mom took us to lunch for salads. Mom asked to sit outside under an umbrella, and it was a lovely day. I felt a little awkward, though, when we got to the patio and the host (manager?) moved an umbrella away from a different table (without asking) and left the sun to beat down on a woman's head. Luckily, they left shortly after we sat. I ordered a Moose Drool and enjoyed a light breeze, an experience I couldn't have had if I were home in Illinois.   All of the salads were very delicious (see pics). I wanted seared tuna but liked the ingredients on the portobello salad better, so I asked to substitute one salad for the other. (I said I wanted tuna but I'd rather have the stuff that's on the other salad.) I ended up getting both the mushroom and the tuna on the fixings that came with the portobello salad, which was a strange communication error. I ate it all, though, and wanted more. My cousin ordered the salmon salad and loved it, and my mom got the lump crabmeat salad, which she's had before and is her favorite thing on the menu. It has asparagus!   Bobby's is expensive and the half salad is quite small, but the ingredients are fresh and the dressings are perfect. They have good coffee, too. It's an ideal place when someone (like your mom) is paying.

Very good and reasonably priced! I love that Greek salad is an option instead of fries for the same price. I went with my parents for a late lunch and we all enjoyed our meals. I ordered the chicken pita and it was huge.   I ordered a falafel, which was good, but I really love the yogurt cucumber sauce.   If I ever visit my parents in Arizona again, I will definitely ask to go back!

My parents had eaten here before its makeover by Restaurant Impossible, and they were interested in checking it out again, so we went to dinner here on Tuesday night.  The decor was nice but it was very loud--we had to shout at each other to hear and it wasn't even very crowded. I wished we had sat outside.   I noticed that the restaurant seemed understaffed or perhaps it was just that our server was inexperienced. Our server was hardly there. We were brought water very quickly (by a busser or host) after being seated, but did not see a server for quite some time. We put our dinner orders in on her first visit  to the table, but we hadn't chosen what to have to drink. I told our server I was going to pick out a wine, expecting her to check right back, but she didn't. Our food was delivered by a food runner and we ordered our drinks then.   After we got our meals, she didn't check back with us for quite some time, even when she was with the tables next to us. This tells me she was new at serving (and not down with multi-tasking yet. I remember that vaguely from when I first started waiting tables).  I ordered the chicken ossobuco because the description in the menu was delightful (braised chicken legs with roast herb pan sauce over mushroom risotto). Unfortunately, the flavors weren't very subtle and the risotto was greasy--plus, it had a yellow cheese on it, which turned me off. The chicken was good, though, and I got to share it with my dad, who only ordered a salad.  The others in my group, by the way, enjoyed the food more than I did. My cousin had the pizza gattopardo, my mom had veal piccata, and my dad had the della chiesa salad. I didn't taste their meals, but based on my experience, I wouldn't want to return.

The service, the salad, the drinks . . . this is a yumtastic place (but would be even better if someone else is paying). Definitely worth a visit when you're in Scottsdale!

When on vacation in Phoenix, after a good long hike, the next thing on the list is (or should be) beer!  After lunch on Monday, my cousin asked Siri if there were breweries nearby, and she directed us here. We ordered two flights so we could try all eight of their draft beers and it was loads of fun (and convenient as my cousin likes hoppier beers and I do not). The beer was delicious and the environment is laid-back. Definitely a fun, but low-key, place to hit in Phoenix.   A big problem was that our bartender lined up the beers in the wrong order in our first flight (the one he said was watermelon ale was definitely an IPA, of which there were two on that flight)--we thought he just had the four reversed, but after comparing the beer colors with other customers and the descriptions in the menu, we realized that, no, they were all sorts of scrambled. (In the end, I still wouldn't have felt comfortable buying any beer to go because I still wasn't sure which I liked best of those four). The biggest surprise was the watermelon wheat ale--I notoriously hate all watermelon flavored things (but can tolerate actual watermelon a few times a summer) but this ale only had the most subtle of watermelon flavor. It wasn't super fruity or sweet at all.  The yummiest, I thought, was the Ironwood Imperial Porter (on the second flight). It has high IBUs for my taste (60), but somehow I really enjoyed it. Perhaps it's offset by the chocolate malt. (Mmmm . . . chocolate).  I should have brought a growler home in my checked luggage!
