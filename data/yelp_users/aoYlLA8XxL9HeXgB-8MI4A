I used to regularly order from there but the last two times I did the pizza wasn't any good.  It was under cooked again and too doughy.  For the amount of money you spend it's not worth it anymore.  Way to much money for what you get.  It's nothing like a real Chicago Rosati's.  Papa Murphy's is better.

Had the Italian beef, it sucked & over priced!

Foods usually good, service still sucks.  Painfully slow.  Don't get the beef brisket.  Over priced.
