I've been going to this Macaroni Grille location for many years and it seems that over time it just keeps getting worse.  They are constantly out of signature items and the service has been dismal of late.  Most of servers are nice and friendly but they are constantly understaffed.  It seems as if the managers like to have as few staff as necessary on hand, so when it gets busy, the customers suffer.  I will look for better options in the west valley if they don't change this practice SOON!  If it wasn't for the delicious Penne Rustica, I would have probably stopped going already.

This family has been serving Mexican food  to west valley residents for decades.  La Loma is a sister restaurant with another location that closed down a few years ago. The food here is always delicious and the service is friendly. Once they get to know you, you feel like family.  As others have said, it's not the traditional restaurant experience, but we go there for the food and not to be waited on. Stop in for a great lunch or dinner and make sure you try the hot sauce...it's amazing!

Based on the reviews here, I called Jeff and he was able to meet me in the far west valley a few hours later.  I only needed some minor work done, but the service was professional, punctual, friendly, and priced fairly. What more can you ask for? If you need a locksmith, call A 1/Jeff!!

Went there for the first time the other night...I'd heard good things. It was very busy went we got there, but they were able to seat us quickly. The menu is pretty good if you like sushi, they have plenty of options. We also got some not sushi items and they came out great, very tasty.  The service was a little strange, we seemed to have three or four waitresses come by and ask us if we were ready to order, the first came after we had literally been sitting for 30 seconds...fine for drink order, but give me few to look at the menu. Felt a little rushed.  Overall I would recommend, good portions and the service has quirks but not terrible.

Great burgers and atmosphere at The Grind.  The burgers are HUGE and amazing...my personal favorite is the peppercorn.  Combined with some regular or sweet potato fries, it's a great meal. Service always seems to be friendly and prompt. They play music which I enjoy and have a number of TV's above the bar.

We decided it was time to get our old carpet out of the house and upgrade to wood laminate.  Searched all over the place for a good deal and found some reviews of Sean on Yelp.  Called him and he gave a very reasonable estimate for installation which included many of the things the big companies charge extra for. He doesn't care where you buy the materials, but will hook you up with his wholesaler if you choose (we did). Installation was very smooth and the floors look awesome.  We had a corner of one of the boards come up a tad due to the type of material we used, Sean came out and tried to fix it by cutting the board out, but when HE realized it wouldn't be to his standards he came back with Sebastian was took part of the floor apart and put it back together again.  In short, Sean gives great prices, great work, and even better follow-up. In my experience he is booking fast, so call them soon!

Tropical Smoothie Cafe has great smoothies...go with the Jetty Punch!  Had the food for the first time today and the buffalo chicken toasted wrap was excellent.  In my opinion, this is the best smoothie place around, including the two better known places.  Head in before 8:00 AM for a discount on smoothies.
