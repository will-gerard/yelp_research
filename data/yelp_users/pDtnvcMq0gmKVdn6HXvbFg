Worst place for mariscos. Food wasn't  good at all; extremely bland and Service was terrible. We stood there for a good 3-5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. The waitresses passed us by and just looked at us without saying a thing while we stood there waiting to be seated. We asked for drinks along with glasses of water and when the bill was given to us we discovered we were charged $3 for the water. This place always looks busy and I don't understand why. Phoenix needs more GOOD mariscos restaurants!

This place has great prices! The owner is a sweet humble Asian lady, shes not pushy and she even gave me a free lotion sample on my first visit! What other nail place does that?

They should have one of those red signs on the door "beware of the mean lady" --- the people that work here have zero courtesy. We came here for some rainbow cookies and although they were tasty, they werent amazing or anything.. I only say this bec ive tried pastries straight from upstate :D

"Comida chingona" for sure ! If you want higher end mexican, give this place a try! The Guava mimosas were sooo good! I tried a little bit of the cochinita pibil and although im not a fan of pork I did find it rather tasty! I liked my enchiladas but I'd have to say the spinach crepes were my favorite!

I used to love h&m until I came to this store. I had just arrive when suddenly the power went out! Some of the other stores were up and running and according to some bystanders the electric company was aware and working on it. So I headed to the neighboring stores in hopes that the power would soon come back up, and it did! I went back inside h&m and the sales people looked mad to be there. I over heard one girl say that other stores that were affected got to go home but they didn't.  The attitudes of the employees were terrible. Shortly after, the power goes out AGAIN!  This time i stayed outisde the door along with some others but the employees said they were closing for the night.  Within two minutes the power went back on and I watched as a lady knocked on the door and the sales girl open the door and yelled that they were closed. Its ok that the power went off, what's not ok is for employees to be rude just because their anxious to leave!

And this is why hole in the walls are the best! Felt like it was a taco that you find on the streets of Sonora

The food is aight! The fondu didn't impress me at all  :/ However, the concept is really cool! Its a nice place to hangout at... I love the games outside and the free valet is nice too, AND its kid friendly. Big plus in my book :)

Asian+mexican! Muy rico. We pretty much tried half the menu lol. Portions are small so ordered a few things. My fave was the passionfruit sangria and the chingon roll. The pad thai was good but I think I like the traditional version best. Also really love the tree :)

My balayage highlights look like CRAP! Not sure if this place is new or if Im just the lucky first to review this place! I was not happy walking out of that salon. My hair was done by Janelle, and she seemed highly knowledgable at the beginning of my first appointment with her . I went over all of my concerns and explained that my hair had undergone some bad color jobs. I had previously put box color in my hair thus making my hair multi toned and I thought she would try to correct the color but she didn't seem to care one bit. when I questioned the finished look, she said "oh well, thats just what happens when you have box color , theres no way around it " so im stuck with uneven diff colored highlights. Never going back there again! She and all the other stylists there seemed Bored and uninterested too, like they weren't enjoying what they were doing, just there for a paycheck and fat tips!
