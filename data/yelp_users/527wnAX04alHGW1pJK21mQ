Zero stars if possible. Went there and saw 5 cars in the drive thru, decided to go in and order. 5 employees working, all focused on drive thru, no one acknowledged us for 5 minutes as I timed it. Ordered a Mountain Dew Slush and no one had replenished the mix, employee seemed bothered that they had to refill machine. Whole thing took 10 minutes and still no drink. Cancelled my 1 drink order, manager on duty had no clue what to do or say. Will never be back.

Always happy to see you, cashiers are very nice and place is very clean. Great daily specials, I always wait for taco Tuesdays. Can't beat it.

Zero stars if possible. Young kid there named Shay.  I work 12 hour days and stay later if more customers come in. I never decline business no matter what time it is. Finally got a chance to leave work at 820 pm.  Called the store multiple times but no one would answer their phone.  Arrived there at 850pm,  and Shay said he was not willing to stay any later past 9pm to do any work since his ride was there to pick him up. I just needed some links taken off my new watch.  Frustrated that he declined business,  I asked who the owner was and he stated it was his grandfather and his uncle was the manager,  so they would not care if he declined business.   I hope uncle and grandfather are reading this..  And are good at math so that they can figure out how much missed revenue young Shay is costing them.   You have lost a customer for life,  and I dont understand his work ethic. If one of my employees declined a paying customer,  id say find a new place of employment!

Awesome service, great food, I always get the crab legs and sushi, the honey walnut shrimp is very good also. Get there early for dinner, cause all the tables are full, even during the week. Servers very fast the refill your drinks and take away your finished plates. Will be coming back again. Don't know why there are 1 star reviews on here. Have never had a bad experience at this buffet.

They cannot handle the traffic on weekends. If you get there an hour after they open if feels like you have to beg for food. Or the answer you get is I don't know, it's coming soon.

Starting up a business is tough..... Adding new customers and keeping them is even a bigger challenge now a days.  Went there with my family of 4. 4 burgers, 4 drinks, fries, onion rings, funnel cake, total bill $34. Fine with that.  Here's the thing that bothered me with this new business.... Forgot that I wanted "grilled onions" after I ordered and paid, and was told by one of the owners I believe that it would be another 75 cents or so.  In n out gets you onions anyway you want for nothing extra. Raw onions are included, why is it so hard to put some onions next to the patty and grill it too?  I will not be returning.

Been using the splash pass for over 6 months, now what I get is not what I use to pay for. No more tire dressing with my monthly fee. They would not honor what was agreed to. The people up front who greet you need an attitude check also. They act like this is the only place to get a car wash. I hope they go out of business!
