I love this place. Located right in the little city I grew up in.. along with the awesome craft beer comes some of the BEST food you can imagine. The reverse happy hour food is unbeatable. But! bring back the macaroni &cheese bites! Oh yeah, the bartender Ryan is the coolest!

I'm happy to see that this vets office has made positive impacts on people's lives. I'm glad that they provided great service to people and took care of the animals that they love. But what I experienced yesterday with this office and the employees I cannot stand for.  I came home yesterday to find my puppies eyes swollen shut. Immediately I began looking for something he could have gotten into that caused this so I would have an idea what to tell the vets. This clinic is the closest, by far, vets office in my area so I knew exactly where to go. There was nothing broken or chewed so I had no idea what was wrong with him, so of course I was panicking.  When I came into the office, with a big puppy in my arms (a Siberian Husky) the employee didn't even acknowledge me. She didn't even look at me. She just sipped her latte and slowly walked behind the counter and told another woman someone was there with a dog that doesn't look good. I didn't want to appear unhinged, which I was, so I waited until the woman came and told her 'I didn't know what happened, maybe kitty litter is in his eyes' please help. I literally said 'please help'. She didn't ask any questions. She just stared at me and told me to wait. Someone behind the counter said "they don't have an appointment" to which the woman said to me "we only do appointments and your not scheduled for one". I was already running out the door when she handed my mom a flyer for the emergency animal clinic 2 miles away. I said I was going to leave a review so here it is. What kind of veterinarian turns a young woman with a dog in her hands away because they don't have an appointment? No one was in the building except for employees obviously not wanting to be inconvenienced. I would be so much more understanding of they had been helpful or polite but the demeanor of the women I saw working there was so arrogant, unconcerned and rotten I had to share my experience.  Once we reached E.A.C. I was met at the door by the doctors, grabbing my dog and rushing him to the back. He was stung by a bee or a spider and was having an allergic reaction that could have caused cardiac arrest. No appointment necessary. He's doing fine now and is back to his happy self. I thank them very much for their immediate response and help. I highly recommend going to these vets over this business any day. I question their abilities as veterinarians. Nice office though.

Went three times and never going back. So my boyfriend and I LOVE Thai food and he recommended this place. On all three occasions once we started ordering I realized that whenever I asked for something, like chopsticks, napkins... a spoon.. the female waitresses, just like the male waiter wouldn't look at me or converse with me but to my boyfriend. As if he was my ruler and/or decision maker. For everything! We found it extremely low, disrespectful and culturally insulting. Not to mention, the waiters are super rude and some of the vegetables in the curry were totally spoiled. And the restaurant smelled bad! Like sewage and poop.  It's like this... Clean the restaurant, don't serve people spoiled food.. and have some dignity and respect!

I just paid $17.00 for 3 iced coffees that were only filled 3 quarters full and I'm Not happy about it. No coffee in the world is that expensive except for here.

I am what one might call a regular to this place. I love all the bartenders and staff. They are so funny and cool, professionalism is never an issue and I love that. I can honestly say the staff here is top notch along with the service. Oh yeah! You can order or substitute Gardein in everything! Try gardein nachos and/or gardein lettuce wraps! You will love it :)

Honestly, I really like this place. They have Four Peaks Hop Knot on draft which is awesome. I really like all the food I've had there but the big thing is that the bartenders, staff and I think the general manager have always been really nice to me. Met some really cool people. You should try it out!

I'm so happy that Draft house came into the location where McDuffys used to be. I loved that place too but Draft house has like 50 rotating taps of craft beer from California to New York. All American exclusive craft brews. Pool tables, darts, shuffle board and an awesome upstairs patio. And you should go! You'll Thank me later :D

Eddie rocks! Normally when going to Ross.. or any store for that matter we have to suffer with the burden of people's screaming, crying children. Not this time. Best experience I've had shopping maybe ever. Great employee! Very helpful and funny~
