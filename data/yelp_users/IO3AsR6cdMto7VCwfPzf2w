I've only been here for happy hour and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Margaritas for $3 and food items for $3, $4, or $5. I had two margaritas and a chicken quesadilla and spent only $10. Can't really complain about that. The bartenders are cute and friendly and they have MLB Network. What more does a girl need?

Went in here around 12:45 today and the place was packed but the service was still good. I waited in line for less than five minutes, ordered, and waited less than ten minutes to receive my food. They handle the lunch rush with ease. In my opinion, the food in general is overpriced but that's the same at any location. It is literally right off the lightrail, which is super nice. I usually go to Subway by campus but stopping here might become a regular thing for me now.

As I mentioned before, I am very stingy when it comes to giving five star reviews. An experience has to be pretty mind blowing for me to do so. That being said, my experience at Cheuvront tonight was definitely worthy.  Our server, Drew, was absolutely wonderful. He was friendly, charming, and not hard to look at. He made us laugh and made sure our meal was perfection. He provided some of the best service I have received period, which is a lot to say because I go out to eat frequently. I will definitely be returning and bringing my friends and requesting him.  The food was just as great as the service. We went for restaurant week, so we each did the $30 dealio that comes with three courses. I did the poached pear salad, salmon, and the peach cheesecake. We also decided to try their mac and cheese because we had heard good things about it. The mac and cheese (we got the pesto and spinach one) was TO DIE FOR. I am salivating just thinking about it. I love me some mac and cheese so I am always excited to find really good ones. They also had a couple other options to choose from that I definitely will be back to try. My salmon was cooked to absolute perfection. The cheesecake was also amazing.   My girls and I left totally stuffed but totally happy.  My only issue with this place was the bathroom. It was a little odd, but hey it had a toilet so I can't really complain.  They have a parking lot and they are also right off the light rail so they are super accessible.   I'd definitely recommend this place for a date or a girl's night. It definitely has a romantic, luxe feel. I will definitely be back!

I just really like the idea of this place. Sports and rock and roll? Who doesn't love that? The menu items all have clever names, some of which made me giggle. I was hoping the servers would be all Alice Cooper-ed out but they just a little bit of eye makeup on. The food is pretty cheap and they have drink specials every day of the week. We ordered the lobster quesadillas, onion rings, and a side salad. Everything tasted good and it was really filling. The service could have been a little bit better but I was so enthralled by the large televisions playing Sportscenter and all the concert posters on the walls that I didn't really mind. I definitely can see myself going here again after a basketball or baseball game.

Went to the Sun's game here tonight. I really enjoyed going to this venue. We took the light rail and it dropped us off a block away. I went with a group of ASU students and we got a sweet deal. $4 a ticket for upper level seats. And we got let in before doors to watch the shoot around from the front row. And we got free drawstring bags. I'm not quite sure how they got those tickets but they were pretty sweet.  The venue itself is pretty nice. A plethora of food choices and gift shops on each floor. They also have a game room/playground upstairs. I had a philly for my meal. It was good and a decent amount of food for what I paid. The crowd was into it, and even though I wasn't really a fan of the two teams playing, I found myself yelling and booing (or LOUUUUing) along with them. I'd definitely go see another game here.

This is basically the lesbian Charlie's. It was pretty quiet for a Friday night, but from what I have heard most people in Phoenix go out on Saturday nights so that's the night to go out. The employees were really friendly and the drinks weren't outrageously priced. They played mostly country, but switched it up towards the end of the night. There is a huge parking lot at the Food City next door so you don't have to worry about finding a spot. The crowd was younger than what I have seen at Z Girl Club. So far this is my favorite lesbian bar in Phoenix. I'll definitely be going back on a Saturday when there are more people!  $10 minimum on credit cards.

I had never been to an On the Border restaurant until Friday and I'd always wanted to try it. We ordered the made-to-order guacamole to start which was FABULOUS. They make it right by your table and give you these massive freshly made chips to eat it with. Yum. For my meal I got the fish tacos and they were delicious but really filling. We sat on the outside patio area and it was nice, minus the annoying flies and gnats. It would be nice if they put some screens up on the windows. Our waitress was super friendly and kept making sure everything was fresh and tasty. I will definitely be returning for that guacamole and to try what else is on their menu.

Dear Apple, thank you for consistently surprising me with your service. Love, me.  When I bought a Mac two years ago I didn't realize that the money I was paying was not only for the computer itself but for services for life. The battery on my Mac gave out this past week after years of going strong. I took my computer to this Apple store and received a new battery FOR FREE. Not only that, but the gentlemen dropped everything he was doing just to help me because I was in a hurry. I can't express how happy I am that I decided to purchase a Mac and I will continue to purchase Apple products as long as they continue to service me so wonderfully.

Best service I've ever gotten at a PF Changs. I love when a waitress actually takes the time to talk to us about something besides what we want to drink and eat. Ours did just that and made us laugh. The food was the same as always, but her animation regarding our mutual guilty pleasure, Project Runway, made the lunch memorable. Cheers to that.

We ate here last night for my friend's birthday. The restaurant is very small. They could definitely use an expansion. We ended up waiting about 15 minutes for our table, which wasn't bad. I really like their beer and appetizer deal. If you buy a Kiran or Kiran Lite, you get one of their appetizers for 99 cents. You can't beat that. The food was all really yummy and high quality. The prices are pretty good as well. Most of the time you can get either a 5-piece or 8-piece roll, which gives you the chance to try more without spending a lot. They also give you fresh oranges to end your meal. The service was a bit lackluster, but maybe that's just the way the restaurant is run. Since it was my friend's birthday, they brought over the lucky cat statue (excuse me for not knowing what it's called) and sang to him in Japanese, which was pretty cool. In the end, I would definitely eat here again when I'm craving some delicious sushi!

I've been looking for a smokin' hot birthday dress for my 21st celebration and hadn't had much luck. After being totally unsuccessful in Saks Off 5th, me and my friend wandered in here. I am SO glad we did. I found not only the perfect dress, but the perfect shoes as well. All for around $100. The ladies that worked there were super sweet and took care of us. I'd definitely go back here to get a cute outfit in the future!

I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We went on a Saturday night so it was bustling with young people. They have every fun bar game you could imagine: pool, darts, shuffle board, air hockey, karaoke, and more. They also have Shocktop on tap which is a win-win for me. Get a couple drinks in you and you are bound to have a blast here. I know I did.

I was a little apprehensive returning to another Sonic after some really bad experiences at locations in California but eating here made me a believer again. Needless to say I've been back twice since the original visit and its starting to show.

I finally checked this place out for the first time this week. My friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Sharks game and I always wanted to try Native so we came here. It was decently busy because it was a Friday night. We sat at the bar in the outside patio area. The bartender was busy but super friendly and turned on the game. He was even nice enough to turn the volume on even though I was the only one there watching that game. We managed to get there for happy hour which was pretty good. $2.50 and $3 beers, appetizers for $4, as well as long islands and some other drinks for pretty cheap. The thing that will keep me coming back is the $2.50 Coronas and Pacificos, which are served all day everyday. The food was pretty generic. The buffalo chips were disappointing as was the artichoke dip and the tailgater sandwich. The strippers (or whatever the heck they are called) and my greek salad were were pretty good though. When its hot, the misters make the outside patio so nice. I will come here again to watch a game, drink too many Coronas, and pig out on wings, but pretty much for that reason only.

This place is terrible. I had an eye infection and the health center at ASU sent me here. I wish they hadn't. The secretary is rude and so are most of the patients. You never actually get seen at your appointment time. I waited as much as an hour. They take people in whatever order they damn well please. They skipped me for some obnoxious woman who had a later appointment. Now that my eye is better, I will not be returning and I recommend that no one else does either. Unless you want to pay a heinous amount of money to get treated terribly.

We enjoyed our stay here very much. Booked it a couple says in advance. Was a good $40 cheaper than most of the hotels on the strip. We paid $80 each for Friday and Saturday night and another $40 for Sunday. Those prices do not include their resort fee of $10 a night that gives access to the pool, valet and parties for free.   The decor was beautiful. Very gothic. Each room was named after an artist and had their artwork all over the inside of the room. I enjoyed the shower and the large bed. We had some issues with the TV, but we weren't in Vegas to watch television. Our room had a fabulous view of the strip as well.  Staff was all very friendly and helpful, from the bartenders to the front desk staff to the maids. Our best experience was with one of the valets. I wish I had gotten his name, but he worked Friday, September 25th during the day and he was absolutely fabulous.  THIS IS NOT A FAMILY HOTEL. It is meant for young couples and singles. It is known as an after-hours hot spot so there is loud music until 8am. if you are going to Vegas to catch up on sleep, this is not the hotel for you.  It's close to the strip, but not on the strip. It was a quick 5 minute drive for us. It's a good choice if you want a boutique feel, but don't want to pay the ridiculous prices to stay on the strip.  We would most definitely stay here again.

I'm obsessed with this place. It definitely is one of my favorite bars in Vegas and in general. If I lived closer I'd be here every weekend. The crowd is great. It's a mix of older folk, tattooed kids, and locals. There is karaoke on the weekends and the crowd definitely gets into it. The drinks are really cheap, especially for Vegas, and you definitely won't spend as much as you would if you went out on the main part of the strip. My friends and I had a total blast here. Next time I'm in Vegas, this is one of the first places I'm gonna go.

I went back to Las Vegas a few weeks ago with a buddy. My one requirement while we were there was that we go to Dino's. Needless to say we ended up spending a couple drunken nights there. I hadn't been in nearly 2 years, but I loved it just as much as I did the first time, if not more. Drinks are still super reasonable and it still has the local feel. This time I bonded with their KJ (or Karaoke DJ). He does a great job of getting the crowd into it and is the nicest guy in the world. He was a champ and sang Endless Love with me and didn't complain when I kept changing my song choices (the drunker I get, the more I think I sound like Mariah Carey). Their regulars made me feel like I was welcome and at home.  After going back there I can only say one thing, I would actually move to Vegas to go here every weekend. It's that good.

I should have listened to all the reviews and stayed away from here. Here are my pros (few) and cons (several):  Cons: -They don't sell the $1.50 Bud Lights here. -There was not a blonde, large-breasted waitress in sight. Honestly they all looked like they were fresh out of high school. -Service was definitely lacking. Asked for a water and didn't receive it and had to ask again. -Food was super bland. The wings were not "hot" by any means. -There was a line out the door and it took forever to be seated, even though there were two hostesses and several open tables.  Pros: -To be honest, I can't even think of one. I was expecting so much more from the Hooters in the Hooters casino.  Save yourself the time and money and go elsewhere.

I had an absolute blast here. Hot bartenders dressed like cowboys? Yes please. The people that go here are all really friendly and outgoing. I made several new friends in the couple of hours me and friends were there. I danced my little tushie off and thoroughly enjoyed not having to give a crap what I looked like because none of the males there were looking at me. When I went, they were playing hip-hop, though I'd love to go when they have country booming. I had a vodka red bull and a few beers and the only downfall about the drinks was that the mixed drinks are really weak. The totally fabulous drag queen that was there dragged me up on stage because it was my first time and made me dance in front of everyone which was definitely an experience. She also bought me a shot of 151, also an interesting experience that I am unlikely to repeat. I spent the night dancing, laughing, and drinking and had a great time and I am surely going to return in the near future.

This is one of my favorite dive bars in the area. There is sports stuff all over the walls, great drink specials and daily food specials, and some of the best wings in the valley. Rick, Jeff and the rest of the staff are all super nice and the bar has a really homey feel to it. Be aware, the bar is known to be haunted and sometimes weird things happen when you are there. Sit back, order some wings, down some beers, and try not to get attacked by a ghost.

I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We went today around 10 a.m. this morning. We were quoted 40 minutes and waited about that. Prepare to wait because this place is always packed. I was really impressed by the service. The hostesses knew what every single person on their extremely long list looked like. There was no annoying, loud screaming of names or stupid buzzer things. They personally walked up to each person to take them to their seats. It was refreshing. The tables turned really quickly and were promptly cleaned and re-sat within minutes. The service inside was just as good. We were greeted right away and ordered. The food didn't take forever and was DELICIOUS. I can honestly say it was the best eggs benedict I've ever had. The portions were huge for the price. Our coffees and waters will filled before they were even close to being empty. The place runs like a well-oiled machine. Its no surprise they are always as busy as they are. I plan on talking my family here when they come out for spring training. If you are coming from out of town I highly recommend you check it out.  Oh and bonus points for the large television playing the Syracuse game.

I love Johnny Rockets. This location is a total disappointment. The girls that work there aren't very friendly and don't pay attention you order. I would recommend having them repeat your order so you actually get what you want. I ordered a tuna melt and ended up with a cold tuna sandwich that I had to throw away. It was a total waste of $10. I will pass on this place the next time I eat at the mall.

I grew up a tomboy. I am lost when it comes to a lot of this girly stuff. Basically, since I have moved to Arizona, my hands have gotten really dry because I am not used to the climate. I knew I needed some sort of heavy duty lotion to solve the problem, but I had no idea where to go or what to get. I walked in here and told the girl my issue and it took her ten seconds to respond with the perfect remedy. I then paid and left. I don't think I spent more than five minutes in the store, total. That's great customer service and the reason I will be back here next time I need something girly that I don't understand.

We went here last night for the Emmure, We Came as Romans, Woe is Me, and blessthefall show. I really like the venue. It has a really interesting layout, one you wouldn't expect for a show. They have tight security, but I didn't mind. I'd rather wait in line a little longer to prevent getting shanked. They have several bars selling semi-overpriced drinks, which was expected. They have clean, accessible bathrooms and a lot of space to mingle or join in on the pit. The acoustics could have been better, but it was also a hardcore show so I wasn't expecting them to be amazing. They have free parking in a garage right across from the venue as well, which is always nice. I'd definitely see another show here. It also doesn't hurt that Dos Gringos is right across the street!

Gah I hate this place. Such cute clothes, shoes, and purses. We went in about an hour before they closed today and were treated warmly and with respect. They grabbed the stuff we were carrying a set up a room for us, which I really appreciate. The ladies in the women's department and the teen's department were all very friendly and helpful. I would give them five stars but I didn't enjoy how I was treated in the handbag department. I felt like all they wanted was to get me to buy something instead of genuinely wanting to help me. Besides that I was happy with this location overall, and I look forward to spending huge amounts of cash here in the future. My apologies in advance to my wallet.

The happy hour here is pretty sweet. Sake and Kirin is $6 during happy hour as well as a plethora of sushi and appetizers for half off. I got gyoza, shrimp tempura roll, california roll, and their wings and didn't spend more than $15. Everything tasted good and the service was pretty good. We were lucky to find parking right out front but it looked like it could be an issue on a busy night. Sit outside. You can people watch and enjoy the beauty of Old Town Scottsdale.

I am an avid second hand shopper. I love Crossroads and Buffalo Exchange. I was not impressed at all. If I could change the name I would call it My Mother's Closet. Everything was very matronly and the size selection was horrible. A lot of the stuff was extremely used and very overpriced. The ladies that work there were old and not very friendly. I wanted to try on some YSL sunglasses and I changed my mind because they were so rude and didn't even acknowledge my presence. My mother would like it there but I found everything kind of ugly. I wouldn't even give the store a second chance.

I always have great service here. Their happy hour is banging, and the employees are nice to look at. I've never had a bad experience here.  The bathrooms are a little creepy though. You have to go through a separate door in the back, but besides that everything here is delicious and filling.  Also, if you check in on Foursquare, they will give you free edamame or miso soup. So don't forget to show it to your waiter!

I loved this place. The food, beer, service, and overall ambiance all worked for me. Both me and my friend had the salmon BLT and I got the Kiltlifter. The sandwich and the beer were absolutely delicious. There is nothing quite like enjoying a cold brewski outside with good friends and good food, and Four Peaks delivers that. Its worth driving around looking for parking, don't let that stop you. I will definitely be going back here in the future to try their seasonal beers (they were in between seasons when I went), buy fresh-brewed beer to take home, and try some more of their delectable menu. One of my favorite spots in Tempe by far.

I ordered from here because I was craving a good sandwich and needed some place that delivered. I used the online website and was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was to maneuver and figure out. They called to make sure they got the address right BEFORE leaving to deliver it which was refreshing. I ordered an 8' Dodge City and a side salad. The side salad came with fresh, yummy bread. The sandwich was the perfect size and tasted delicious. The portions were perfect for how hungry I was. This place is also great late night if you have spent the evening having several alcoholic beverages. They are open and deliver until 3 a.m. Check it out.

I loved this place. I can't believe I hadn't checked it out sooner. The concept is hilarious and the food is really good. I got The Kind (bacon, turkey, swiss, and mushrooms) and it was delicious. The guys that worked there were really warm and friendly and joked with me. They even have Kool-Aid which I think is awesome. The sandwiches don't need mustard or mayo; the oregano and oil and vinegar give it enough flavor. This has easily become my favorite sandwich shop in the Tempe area and I look forward to eating here again as soon as possible.

I love Pita Pit. I used to eat at the one in Syracuse all the time. Unfortunately, this location has some serious issues. I called to order a pita for lunch today for delivery. I was put on hold for a couple minutes and then apparently the phone was picked up but no one was there to help me. So in the end, I wasted five minutes of my life listening to their employees take other people's orders and completely ignore that I was on the phone. I would have possibly gone in here or ordered from here again, but now that will not be the case. The management should teach their employees phone etiquette.

I was looking for more of an edgy cut and didn't really know who would be the best hair stylist to do it. After research, I found Erica at Grooming Humans. Not only was she a sweetheart and extremely knowledgable about hair, but she did a fantastic job. At previous salons I've been to, the stylists focused too much on trying to sell me a product instead of explaining them and telling me which would be best for MY hair. Erica did just that. When she was finished, all the stylists and the owner thought she did a fabulous job and I couldn't disagree. I will be going back to her in the future and I recommend others do the same. You won't be sorry.

I'm going to open up this review saying that I have several tattoos and have been into many tattoo shops in my lifetime. I am not just some college girl who wants a tattoo on spring break. Saying that, this shop had a sign out Halloween weekend for $25 tattoos. I had a couple pieces in mind that I wanted to get done (most importantly my San Francisco Giants tattoo) so I decided to just go inside and see what the dealio was. They were doing Halloween-themed only for the deal. I jokingly mentioned that mine was orange and black. When I told them what it was I wanted, one of the artists said disgustingly, "I won't do that for $25." Wow that was rude. All you had to tell me was that it didn't work for the Halloween special. Now you lost a potential customer. If you are trying to get foot traffic, being rude to your customers isn't going to help. I'll just go back to Tattooed Planet, where I don't feel judged for being a young college girl.

My friends have recommended this place several times and I turned them down because I didn't realize that it is a sit down restaurant with food other than pitas. I wish I had gone sooner! I ordered seafood linguini and it was really good. It had huge pieces of shrimp and large mussels and the sauce was delectable. We also ordered the rice pudding for dessert. Its a large portion; you can easily share it. It came with fresh strawberries which really went well with the sweetness. The service wasn't fantastic but I also didn't spend the entire meal searching for my waitress. My only real quip with this place was the parking lot. Its small and fills up quickly. We had to park across the street. Besides that, I would definitely return!

I recently got into an accident and needed some small repairs done to my vehicle. State Farm was covering it and I was told to pick a repair center from their website and this one was the closest to my place. They were extremely friendly. Troy, the main owner I believe, was the one who spoke to me about the repairs. He joked with me that along with the parts needed there also needed to be some new seat covers ordered (I have Steelers and Red Sox seat covers.) I take the car in Monday for the repairs to be done and I look forward to bantering with him again. Great, hospitable service.

I'm still full after eating here. The food is really good and the service is wonderful. We ordered the bruschetta to start and then ordered a pizza and their alfredo pasta. The bill wasn't ridiculous and we had a ton of leftover food.   I agree that the parking lot sucks, but that's Oregano's for you.

My best friend collects college sweatshirts and has been begging me for an ASU one. As I was walking down Mill Avenue to get to the lightrail today I saw this place and wandered inside. It not only sells ASU clothes, there is also food, drinks, cigarettes, and pretty much anything else you could need as a college student. I found the perfect sweatshirt for my friend, for the fraction of the price you would pay at the bookstore and elsewhere, and thus left a happy camper.

We went here tonight to see Jo Koy. I have never been to a comedy show before at an Improv theater so it was a new experience. This place is pretty rad. You can eat dinner here before the show, so its perfect for date night. Be aware that there is a two drink minimum, regardless of whether or not you are drinking alcohol. I had to drink a coke AND an iced tea tonight and paid $7 for it. I understand why they do this; it just would have been nice to know beforehand. The tickets to the show were $20 so I spent about $30 total which was totally worth it. The venue itself is pretty swank. There is no backstage at all so the comedians just mingle with the people. I got up to use the restroom during the opening act and saw Jo in the lobby drinking before his turn. It is pretty intimate, with dim lights and pretty small audience. If you sit in front be prepared to be heckled by the comedians. All in all its a fun little place to go with friends or on a date for a good laugh, and I will definitely be going to another show here in the future.

Upon moving to Arizona I knew I needed to find another tanning salon. So, after speaking to friends, I checked this place out. They have ample parking. I walked in and the girls were very friendly. I was helped right away. I never felt pressured and was happy with what I decided to do. I decided on the monthly membership. it was $60 to start up and is $24 a month from then on. For signing up, I got a $25 discount on my tanning lotion (SCORE!). There were things about this salon that set it apart from the one I went to in Cali and in a good way. First, they set me up with a "schedule" of sorts so I would get the best tan possible in the best way. Second, they had after lotion, wet towels, and spray to make the experience a lot better and to make my tan last longer. I  am very glad I decided on this place to go for my tanning needs and I can't wait to go back!

$12 for four of us! Are you kidding me? I'm used to like four times that. My jaw literally dropped. The employees were funny and nice. My only quip is I think they should do some rounds to see if people need new coals. Instead we had to run and ask for some. But besides that I was sold. Oh and there is a tattoo shop next door. Oy vay!

This is now my favorite restaurant on Mill. I had never been to a Greek restaurant before today and I loved it. My friend got the village hummus here which was absolutely delicious. It comes with some delicious, warm pita bread. I'm definitely going back just to order it. I ordered the mushroom burger and it was HUGE but so good and the Greek salad it came with was also super yummy. We sat up and ate at the bar and the bartender was totally adorable and a sweetheart. I'm looking forward to eating here again in the future.

This probably some of the greatest service I have had to date from a Starbucks location. I really like the layout of this location. Its spacious. The employees are super friendly and my order was repeated several times instead of just being written on a plastic cup and sat down on the counter. I felt like a real customer. I will definitely be returning to this location for my caffeine needs.

The location is kept clean, there are loads of sale racks, and the employees are friendly and will start a room for you once you start to amount masses of clothing. I usually don't find things in here that fit me because I have a broad torso and I feel like a lot of their clothes run small. Today, however, I walked out with a cute tank top that I found on the sale rack and a dress and my friend got two pairs of shoes for $30. I can definitely see myself returning to shop here!

I will not be ordering from this Dominos again. Last week I ordered from here and the pizza took an hour and when we received it it was lukewarm at best. Tonight when I ordered from here they told me they couldn't take my credit card because their machines were down. Strike three and they are out.

I'm kinda bummed that this place lived up to the bad reviews. The hosts seemed to have no clue what they were doing. They seated tables that were obviously still dirty which was gross. The drinks took a while and the food took 25 minutes. The server was cute and friendly but didn't save the meal unfortunately. The staff stopped and danced which was cute but I wish they had payed a little more attention to their tables instead. I ordered the blackened mahi sandwich. It came with a big piece of fish on a cheap bun with lettuce and tomato. It needed something else. I had to use the sauce from my friends crab cake sandwich to give it more flavor. A manager came and checked on us but only briefly. I wish the experience was better than it was. Unfortunately I probably won't go back here.

This review is for the experience I had purchasing tickets for a show at the hotel. I did not stay in the hotel and have no idea how the rooms are or anything like that.  Here goes: we bought tickets here for Thunder from Down Under and Tournament of Kings. They have a package deal where you can get two shows of your choice for $75 a person which is a pretty good bargain. Our Thunder tickets were for Sunday night and our Tournament of Kings ones were for Monday night. We worked it out perfectly that we would go from the Lion King show we had tickets for at 4pm to Thunder which was scheduled at 9.  As I mentioned in my Mandalay Bay and Lion King reviews, we found out that the 4pm show had been cancelled and we weren't informed. Panic ensued. When we bought our tickets for the Excalibur shows we were told there were no exchanges or returns, so we had figured that we just wouldn't see the Lion King, which was a total bummer.  We went back to Salena at Excalibur and explained to her our issue. She was very accommodating and switched our tickets for us. We were relieved and thankful. Salena was professional and made us, the customers, really happy and I'm so thankful that she was able to help us. She really saved our trip.  Thanks Salena!

Me and my best friend wanted to check this place out. We both enjoyed it. Here are my pros and cons:  Pros: - There is ample parking across the street and the lightrail stops right by the bar so its very easily accesible.  - The drinks are decently priced. I mostly had beer and they were all about $4 each. Bartenders were friendly, cute, and fast.  - The music was good. I wanted to dance my little butt off.  - The drag queens were fabulous.  - No cover.  Cons: - We went on a Saturday night and the place was dead. I really wanted to dance but there was no one in the other rooms getting their groove on. I was disappointed.  - Its mostly men. There were a few lesbian couples there but its mostly gay men. (This could be a pro, depending on how I'm feeling.)  I look forward to going back on a busier night. From what I have heard, Fridays are the day to go so we will be checking it out another Friday.

I have been to many ballparks in my day, and I really like this one. Granted its not my favorite by any means (Fenway and AT&T are) but it does the job. Here's what I like about it:  Transportation/Parking- It is right off of the lightrail. If you live any where near a lightrail station this is definitely the easiest way to get there. It gets a little cramped on the ride back but it beats game day traffic getting away from the stadium.  Food- Like the park in Oakland, this park has some sweet deals on food. Oakland does $1 hot dog days on Wednesday. Chase Field on the other hand has deals on food EVERY day. $1.50 hot dogs, corn dogs, small popcorns, milk, and small sodas. They also have $4 beers. I can handle that.  Heat- Arizona heat can be really uncomfortable. Chase Field has a retractable roof that goes over the stadium. Problem solved. This does take a little bit away from the ballpark feel, but I'd rather be comfortable, especially when its 110 degrees outside like today.  Tickets- There are always tickets available and from what I have seen they are pretty affordable. I didn't purchase tickets for today's game so I don't know this for a fact but I assume its the case.  Crowds- Like I mentioned previously not many people come to the games here. This means short lines for food and beers and being able to walk around the stadium without being trampled.  All in all it is a nice, clean place to watch a ball game without spending a whole lot of money.

I really want to give this place five stars. Unfortunately, the service we had is keeping me from doing so. Our waitress seemed really overwhelmed and wasn't very friendly.  It's very similar to Hanny's. You can tell they are owned by the same people. AZ 88 is a little less spacious though. The tables are pretty small and really close together. They have a great patio area and from what my friend told me they open up the glass walls during nice weather to make it more spacious. They also have a DJ.  The food was fabulous. We started with the hell fire chips: homemade chips with melted blue cheese and hot sauce. They were delicious. Both me and a friend got the Burger Las Braises and it was SO good. It had jalapenos, salsa, cheese, and avocado on it. It was cooked to perfection and came with waffle fries, fruits and veggies, and a pickle. So much food but too good not to eat it all.  Prices are little high, but it felt worth it for what we had. Glasses of wine were $9 a pop but you could tell it was good wine so I wasn't too bummed about that.  My favorite part of the restaurant? The bathrooms. I love the pink lights and all the mirrors.  I'll definitely be back.

I have died and gone to shopaholic heaven. Walking through here I was salivating. They have everything you could ever dream of and the decor is fabulous. Its chic and upper class and I don't imagine a ton of high school kids venture here to hang out. If you are a poor college student like myself its a total tease but its always fun to look. We went right before they closed (which was probably a blessing) so we didn't get to venture into very many stores but we WILL be back.

This is the third hotel I have stayed at in Vegas and is by far my favorite. It is absolutely beautiful to look at. I thoroughly enjoyed the gondolas that go through the hotel and the guys that man them who also will serenade you. We stayed in a suite and it was, well, sweet. I am not sure how much it cost because I didn't end up paying for it but whatever it was I'm sure it was worth the money. I liked that they had people checking room keys before you could use the elevators as well. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because we wanted to ride the gondolas but felt it was pointless because the outdoor area it would go through was closed and dried up. Its in a great location on the strip and has tons of self parking which are both always pluses. I hope next time the gondola ride is back up and running outside!

This was the best food, by far, that I had my most recent trip to Vegas. The chips and salsa at the beginning were super yummy. I ended up asking for more of the green salsa. The tacos did not disappoint at all. Our waitress was a total doll and was super sweet. I didn't like my margarita and she quickly got me a beer. The only bummer was that we asked to change the television to the Dallas/Miami game and it took them our entire meal to do so. Besides that, it was a really pleasant and delicious experience, and I look forward to going back for their yummy tacos.

This is probably the cheapest sit down option in the Mandalay Bay hotel. They have all-American food like cheeseburgers, sandwiches, and breakfast options. We went for dinner. We were sat at an extremely tiny table that was outside in the hotel area so we could people watch while we ate. My mom ordered a burger and I ordered the tuna melt. The food was average at best. The service wasn't very good for how slow they were. Our iced teas sat empty for a while and our server never checked on us. All their entrees are $15 or more and honestly it wasn't really worth it. I'd recommend checking out Rick Moonen's or Hubert Keller's restaurant instead.

I loved this place. The ambiance and decor is really great. There was a short wait when we got there, so we sat at the bar to have a drink and appetizer while we waited. I had the watermelon margarita and it was super yummy. It even came with a gummy worm in it! Me and my friend shared the garlic and rosemary fries and we couldn't finish them. Once we were sat, we were graced with a very handsome, nice waiter. I accidentally hit him on several occasions (I am an Italian and talk with my hands a lot. Oops.) and he joked with me about it. For dinner I ordered the Casablanca chicken sandwich, because I had heard such great things about it. My taste buds weren't ready for how delicious it was. And again, the portions were huge so I barely finished it. Our server was a really good sport and put up with me flirting with him even though he had a "misses". Props for that. I'll totally be back to eat here again and try some of the other things on their menu!

I loved this place. Its super tiny but the food comes out pretty quickly and they turn tables fast. I ordered the special which had eggs, ham, Fresno peppers, and cheese and came with hashbrowns. Everything was absolutely delicious. Their toast, as well, was a huge highlight. We didn't wait long because we called beforehand and were put on the list. They don't really have a host/hostess, you just write your name on the list, which I found interesting. I spent most of the meal gawking at one of their employees, Travis, who was absolutely adorable. I wish they had eggs benedict, but the food they had definitely made up for it.

This location has the WORST service I have ever seen. I mean, I know people make mistakes once or twice, but EVERY time I eat here something goes wrong. I've had food not given to me that I paid for, really terribly cooked food, and order mess-ups all at this location in just the past few times I've been here. Come on, really, you work at a FAST FOOD place. How hard can your job be? The only reason I keep returning here is because its right near my apartments but it looks like from now on I'll be going out of my way to go to the location on University.

I walked in and felt like a kid in a beer errr candy store. I have never seen so many beers on draft. I was salivating just looking at them all. I ordered the devil eggs as a "snack" and the crab cake sandwich for my meal. Everything was really tasty. I'll definitely be going back to try more of their extensive menu and try every beer they have on tap.

As corny and cheesy as this show was, I totally enjoyed it. Yeah they can't really dance but who the hell cares? They are hot, half naked men shaking their stuff for all the ladies. Who doesn't love that? The host, Marcus, was not only extremely hot (I actually thought he was hotter than the rest of the guys in the show) but he was funny and entertaining. My favorite guy was a thick, sexy, bald man who could break dance like nobodies business. This is definitely a great place for a bachelorette or birthday party. If you wear a sash or a crown you have a better chance of getting up on stage and getting your own show. You have the opportunity to take a photo with the boys at the end for $20. Me and my girlfriend totally enjoyed it. We screamed and hooted and hollered the whole time and left with no voices. Its definitely a must see when you are in Vegas if you are a woman and are with your girlfriends.

My taste buds are still recovering after my experience eating here. I'm angry at myself for not checking this place out sooner. Now that I have, you bet I'll be dragging my friends out here to try it.   First off, if it's your first time, they give you samples of pretty much everything. I think this is awesome, especially if you haven't tried anything there before.  The jerk chicken immediately was my favorite. The chicken was moist and it was spiced perfectly. The jade red chicken was also delicious as well.  You can make a combo with your choice of two meats (alone, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla), rice, and beans for like $9. The portions are huge and you definitely won't leave hungry.  I got the chicken fried rice, black beans, jerk chicken in a quesadilla, and the jade red chicken alone. I couldn't finish much of the rice and beans because I was so full from the delicious chicken. I'm salivating just thinking about it.  The location is in a weird spot. If you don't know what you are looking for, it can be really easy to miss.  I highly recommend checking this place out. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

We finally got a chance to try this place Friday and loved it. The ambiance and design of the place is wonderful. The staff is super friendly and most are very good looking. We ordered a bunch of different appetizers including their nachos, quesadillas, fried calamari, and queso dip. Everything was good, not stellar, but tasted pretty good. The fried calamari wasn't crispy enough for my liking. I left full and happy though, which is all that really matters. We also ordered their sangria, because everyone had talked about it. They have four different flavors. Their passion fruit one is by far the best, a couple of those and you will have a great buzz going on. In general I really enjoyed my experience here, and will definitely be going back for their delicious sangria!

I really dislike the "gym" at my apartment complex so I needed somewhere to get my fitness on. I had passed by this place several times and wanted to check it out. Today, I finally did. The gentleman who helped me with my membership was extremely friendly and made me laugh. I ended up signing up for the $20 a month membership which includes free tanning and free guests on every visit (SWEET!). I look forward to actually going in there to work out and tan!

Oh my gosh I have died and gone to heaven. Why I hadn't been in to an Ikea before today is beyond me. My eyes literally popped out of my head. Pretty colors and even prettier prices. I got wine glasses, a couple frames, hangers, plates, and dish towels and spent $20. I also bought their famous Swedish meatballs, cinnamon rolls, and these marshmallow chocolate thingies. I definitely will be coming here next time I move into a new apartment. If you haven't shimmied into an Ikea yet you are definitely missing out. It's amazing.

There is nothing like a live football game. The fans, the food, and the tailgate. This is a great stadium. It's very new, I believe it's been there a little over four years. There is a ton of parking and a mall with some food and drink options for before or after the game. It's right off of the 101. I still can't get over the sound. We could hear noise erupting from the building from the parking lot. If you aren't there to actually watch the game and are looking to talk on your phone then you will be out of luck because the cellular service inside totally sucks. Besides that it's a great venue to go watch America's favorite sport. I look forward to seeing another game here this season.

This was my first stop on my 21st birthday. There was a $3 cover that I didn't have to pay because, duh, it was birthday! It was slow because of the holidays and lack of students on campus. It was still really fun. There were two guys playing piano and they played a big range of tunes. I was given a free shot for my birthday and my other drinks were purchased for me so I'm not sure how expensive everything was. It was super fun to drunkenly sing along to Kiss, Journey, and whatever else they felt like playing. I'd definitely go do it again.

We came here today for Lauren Conrad's book signing. There were a TON of people there and they managed it very well. It only took an hour to get through the line and get the autograph. The staff was calm, collected, and friendly. They didn't seem to get frazzled by the hundreds of screaming and squealing teenage girls. We had to purchase one of her books to get her autograph which wasn't a problem to me because that's the only way the store will make a profit.  As for the store itself, just looking around I was pleasantly surprised. The prices were really affordable and you can sell your used books back here. They also have a great selection. I really liked the atmosphere as well. I will definitely go back here again for another signing or just to buy some literature!

We came here for lunch today and were seated and helped instantly. The lunch bowls are a great deal. You get rice, your choice of meat, and a side cup of soup for under $9. If you get a beverage it ends up being around $12 for your lunch which really isn't bad for a nice restaurant. Food was great as always and so was the service. I'll definitely be returning.

We came and ate in the cafe. The gentleman behind the counter was extremely friendly and helpful. The food was delicious. I had the turkey grinder with a fresh lemonade. My friends got the tuna and grilled cheese. The restaurant is supposed to be very good as well, but is more for someone who wants to sit down and have a nice meal. For a quick and yummy lunch, the cafe is perfect.

I requested that they move closer to my apartment. This place is AMAZING. I used to work at an Italian restaurant so I know how gelato is supposed to taste and this place doesn't miss the mark. They have a ton of different flavors. I tried the bubble gum, lemon, and pumpkin pie flavors which were all very tasty but I went with my favorite: mango. I was not disappointed. The fellow behind the counter was actually from Italy and he was a total sweetheart. They make their own waffle cones there too and they were fabulous. They also gave us cups of water because we all know how thirsty ice cream can make you. I am in love and can't wait until I venture out to Scottsdale again so I can return here.

I didn't even know this place existed until a coworker suggested eating here for lunch today. I was pleasantly surprised. We both got the half sandwich (brie and beef) and half soup (clam chowda). It also comes with chips. The portions were large for the price ($8.25) and the soup comes in a yummy bread bowl. I was happy with the flavors and the bang for my buck so I definitely will be eating here again!

I think I'm in love.  My friends have been telling me about this place for months and I haven't had the opportunity to try it. Yesterday I finally did and my tummy has never been happier.  I love the ambiance of the place. It's very small, though they are working on an extension. The employees are all tattooed and rugged, which made me feel right at home. Motorhead, System of the Down, and other older rock and roll and metal music pumped through the speakers, making my ears nearly as happy as my stomach.  They have an extensive beer collection with different options from all over the world.  I had the portobello chicken pasty, and it was wonderful. The insides were so delicious and the crust was decadent. It was a lot of food, but I was determined to finish it.  I've heard this place gets super busy at peak hours and I'm not surprised. I am already looking forward to going back and trying another one of their delicious concoctions.  You can also buy their pasties uncooked so you can make them at home!

Absolutely wonderful. I wish I could give them 10 stars. They were that good. I am really picky when it comes to piercing shops and I usually stick to my main one but that one is 1,000 miles away so when one of the studs on my nape piercing came out, I decided to come here. Man am I glad I did. I walked in and was greeted right off the bat. The guys that worked there were honest, friendly, personable, and knowledgeable. I don't think I have ever been that comfortable in a shop before, even at the one I frequent regularly. JD was freaking wonderful. I had to take a significant amount of clothes off for the piercings I got and not once did I feel uncomfortable. He was very meticulous with the placement of the piercings so they would be perfect, which they are. And they are AFFORDABLE. The shop I went to back home was a great shop but it was really expensive. I will definitely be returning to this shop, not only to get pierced again, but to hang out with the totally awesome dudes that work there.

Cheap tickets, beautiful Arizona nights, this is definitely the place to go to catch a film. Its only $6.50 a ticket  and if you really wanted to you could see several films, seeing that they don't moderate who stays after each film is over. I didn't go to the bathroom, nor eat any of the concession food so I can't really speak about that, but it was a fun experience. I just wish that they took credit cards instead of only cash but besides that I'd definitely go back.

This review is slightly bias, seeing that I was in the press box. This park is very nice. Has ample parking and a ton of restaurants in the area for before or after the games. The food in the stadium is typical overpriced stadium food. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl for $7. The vendors are comical (you will hear the lemonade guy from across the stadium). I'd definitely see another game here in the future.

I go to this location a few times a week to pick up coffee for my coworkers. I usually have a large order and am in a hurry. The employees here always take care of me. There is almost always a line in the drive thru but I never feel like it takes too long. The employees are super friendly and fast. Watch out for people trying to steal your spot in the drive thru line!

I really wish I could like this place. We went and gave it another shot last night. At the door, the guys I was with were told that next time they can't wear jeans and flip-flops because they were trying to make it more of a "dance club." They then proceeded to charge us a $1 cover, which is a joke. I will admit, the drinks are cheap ($3.50 for a screwdriver) and strong and both times the bartenders I have gotten were smokin'. Besides that, this place seems to be going downhill fast.

This has quickly become one of my favorite hang out spots in Tempe. My coworkers and I often go here after work to have a drink. The employees that work there are super friendly and so are the other regulars. They are never busy so the drinks never take too long and neither does the food. They are open until 2 a.m. every night so its a good place to go after our restaurant closes. I love the baseball bats on the bathroom doors and the overall vibe of this place. They have happy hour specials from 11-close that include $5 appetizers as well as drink specials. The pizza is pretty good as well. I now stop by here a few times a week and will continue to do so.

I LOVE breakfast, and its places like this that is the reason why. Good service, great food, good atmosphere. There was a wait when we got there but it was pretty quick because we were only a party of two. I ordered the eggs benedict (shocker I know) and my friend ordered their whole wheat pancakes. Everything is delicious and really affordable and the portions are large. We were stuffed and only spent like $15 a piece. My friend swears by their fresh squeezed OJ. They also have a small lunch menu if you aren't in the mood for breakfast. The only problem with this place is how far it is from where I live. I'd definitely make the drive for a darn good breakfast though.

I have been here on a couple of occasions to buy donuts for my coworkers. Today I actually went grocery shopping here. I was very happy with their fruit selection and their customer service. I don't have a Fry's card but the lovely lady behind the counter gave me the discounts anyway. I will be going here again for my grocery needs.

I've been meaning to check out Tilted Kilt and the opportunity presented itself last week.  It was kind of funny. Besides the waitresses, I was the only female in the whole place.  Our server was busy but looked good so you can't really complain. Our food came out how we ordered and pretty quickly.  We got the Irish nachos, which were on happy hour ($5) and the Kilt Club and split everything. I really enjoyed the Club. It had a pesto mayo on it that was really yummy and really good bread. The nachos were good but I enjoyed the sandwich more.  I also loved the atmosphere. As a sports junkie, it was basically my kind of joint. They had drop down screens that played baseball so I was a happy camper.  Definitely a fun place to check out the eye candy and watch a ball game. I'll be back.

This location has super sweet employees, something I'm not used to when I go into a Panda Express. The food was good and I didn't have to wait long. The only bummer I had here was that they didn't have potstickers. The cashier explained to me that they don't carry them in Arizona stores and then proceeded to hold an actual conversation with me. It was nice to talk to someone who wasn't robotic and actual cared. I'll definitely be going back.

I came here specifically for the optical services. I have always had good experiences with the Costco back home so I didn't hesitate to come to this location. The prices are affordable and they really take care of their customers. I went in to sign up for a membership ($50 for a year) and the employee that helped me was very genuine and helpful. I made an appointment for an eye exam for the next week.   Today I went in for the contact lenses exam. The receptionist was friendly and put me at ease. He joked with me about something he saw in the paper and made me laugh. The doctor was great. He asked me a bunch of questions to make sure I got what I needed and was completely satisfied. The exam was $74 and that included two travel size contact solutions and my first pair of contacts.  I was very satisfied with the experience and I will definitely be returning their to get new contacts and for other shopping needs. My only issue with the Costco franchise in general is that they ONLY take check or cash, but besides that I left a happy camper more than wiling to return.

I really enjoyed this place. The lady that helped me was super friendly. The pizza was really good. Really crispy and delicious. They also have happy hour between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. everyday. $2.50 Bud Light pints and $4 pitchers. They also have wine and other alcoholic choices available all the time. The only bummer about this place is that they require a $5 minimum purchase if you use a credit or debit card, but the pizza is good enough that you will want an extra slice anyways.

I decided to go to this location because its closer than the Scottsdale one where I originally got my contact lens prescription. Next time I will drive to Scottsdale to avoid the terrible service. Ended up waiting nearly 30 minutes just to get my new contacts. There was only one guy working the optical department and a massive amount of people and phone calls coming in. Obviously they need to staff better because you could tell he was getting flustered and was blatantly rude to a couple of the customers ahead of me. For my new (disposable) contacts it was $50. $50 for a two-week prescription! Are you freaking kidding me? Needless to say I went in with a headache and left with a migraine.  Oh and on top of that I thought getting a slice of delicious Costco pizza would help after such a crap experience but alas I was wrong. The lady at the food court (again there was only ONE person working) was rude and I felt I was in a drill line. She literally threw my receipt at me. Well, geeze thanks. Oh and the pizza definitely didn't taste like the Costco pizza I'm used to.  Furthermore, what the hell is wrong with people who live over here? Not only were the employees rude but so were the customers.  Three strikes and I'm out of there.

I ordered the salami pesto and goat cheese sandwich and my taste buds will never be the same. It was the best sandwich I have ever had. Like I'm talking about a life changing sandwich here. Try this place. You definitely will NOT regret it. Oh and don't forget a dream bar at the end!

I am a huge fan of the invention called the cupcake, as my protruding tummy makes quite clear. Sprinkles is a snazzy little cupcake joint. It reminds me a lot of Kara's in Santana Row. Tons of flavors, milk, and they even have dog treats. You can also buy cupcake mix to make your own. Yum! We came in here because my friend is a fan of Sprinkles on Facebook and since we whispered the secret word we got our cupcakes for free. Unfortunately, now they have me hooked! Props to the fact that they literally come out from behind the counter to help you. The employees are super sweet (no pun intended) and seem to enjoy their jobs. I will be returning to get my sugar fix in the future.  Oh the only con here is the parking. It isn't bad if you are the only one pulling into the lot but if there are several cars in there it gets tight really quick.

This place it trash. I didn't really even want to walk in. I was gunna try and sell my stuff here, but I quickly changed my mind after walking in. The purses and clothes are pretty worn down and extremely overpriced. A lot of the purses were fake and were being sold for prices that were high for even a real, used purse. They sell other things besides clothes like jewelry and hair accessories for really cheap but its not really worth it. They have cheap gages which was the only redeeming factor. I'm definitely not going to go back here.

I'm a big fan of CPK. The food is decently priced and super yummy. Today me and a friend went to this location. We got there around 1:15 and asked to sit outside. It took about 15 minutes to be greeted. We ordered our drinks and waited another 10 minutes. Finally a manager came over and took our drink order AGAIN and took our food order. She brought us our drinks and 5 minutes later our "waitress" brought us drinks. The food was good as always but I ran out of iced tea quick. No one ever filled it and a whole bunch of servers/managers walked by. I almost got up and filled it myself. It was just a hot mess and I don't know if I'd even return after that.

Today I was craving a sandwich but didn't want to go to the typical Subway or Togo's so I decided to check this place out because it is close to my apartment and I had heard good things. Here are my pros:  Ample parking- the lot is huge and I'd be surprised if it ever filled up.  Friendly employees- she may have been a little bit lost but she was super sweet.  Large sandwiches- I was unaware of what I was in for, so I added salami to my turkey sandwich. Needless to say the sandwich ended up being HUGE. I literally had to deconstruct it to eat it.  Fresh produce and tasty meat- the produce on my sandwich was delicious and crisp. The meat was flavorful and as I mentioned there was a lot of it.  Pickles- The dill pickles I received with my order were scrumptious. I could see why someone would say they are salty but I LOVE salt so it was yummy.  Bread- the bread was delicious. I may have to go back and buy some of their sourdough bread to make sandwiches at home.  Cons:  Price- it was a wee bit more expensive than I was expecting. Its like $8 for a small sandwich and $10 for a large. I also wasn't sure I was charged correctly because the girl taking my order didn't seem to know what she was doing.  I still would like to go back and try their breakfast items, which I heard are fabulous and also to buy the "half moon" cookies they have. (If you are from upstate New York you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about). Oh and I want to try the Ultimate Slider Challenge one of these days.

I love this place. I had been dying to see Hunger Games in theater, but wanted to wait until after I had read the book. Once I had, it was out of regular theaters. It was playing here though and we went running over to see it. This place carries movies that just stopped playing at regular theaters for a fraction of the price. It's only $3 a person, compared to $10 or more at Harkins or AMC. They have a cool game area out front with Pac Man and other games as well as movie memorabilia all over that you can look at before your movie. The food and drinks are also cheaper than the regular theater, so you can have a nice night out at the movies for less than $20 and leave satisfied. The theaters are small but it doesn't take away from the experience at all. We are definitely going back here to see more movies without breaking the bank.

We went here Sunday to watch the football games, eat, play some games, and get our drink on. We sat up at the bar. Ryan, our bartender, was lovely. He was totally adorable and took care of us. We ordered the food and game deal, which I think is really cool. I got the Philly and a $10 game card for like $15. They also have happy hour during games. Blue Moons were like $4. After drinking heavily, we hit the game room and had a blast. The best game to win lots of tickets is the Nascar game. After playing so many games our heads hurt and giggling like fools, we stumbled into the store to exchange our tickets for awesome prices. I ended up with a Patrick stuffed animal and a pixy stix and I was extremely happy. No one bugged us and let us enjoy ourselves. I look forward to going back on Wednesday nights for half-priced games.

I absolutely love this Target. It is a hop, skip, and a jump away from my apartments and super convenient. They always seem to have what I am looking for. The staff is friendly and there to help. I didn't even have to search to find an employee to help me, they are pretty much everywhere. They even had a college night last week where they closed the store down and let ASU students come in and shop their butts off. They were pretty wiped out when I came in last week because of all the kids moving in but they replenished everything that night. As you can see by my amount of check-ins this is where I do most of my shopping and I will continue to do that as long as I am going to ASU!

I really like this mall. Its outdoors and high tech. From our lunch at CPK I could watch the Lakers/Celtics game on a big screen television situated in the middle. There are a ton of stores to choose from: Best Buy, Target, and all the regular stores you see in a mall like Hot Topic, Victoria's Secret, and Tilly's. My friend told me that at night there are lasers that go across the whole mall which I think is cool. There is a lot to choose from for nourishment options as well. They play music really loud which was kind of annoying. i can see why over the summer it may not be very nice because of the heat but, on a 70 degree day like today, I liked it. Parking was terrible which is why I was glad I didn't drive. I'll probably end up going back for all my shopping needs.

I had never been here before tonight and I'm not quite sure why. I like the ambiance, it's very old diner- like. The service was good. At the end of the meal they give you warm, wet towels which reminded me of flying first class. I ordered the Lucille's cheeseburger with mac & cheese. The burger was one of the better burgers I've had in a while. The mac & cheese was really good as well. I was so excited that we were given spear dill pickles with our sandwiches. I definitely need to come back here and try the ribs. The BBQ smell is intoxicating.

A DMV experience that wasn't totally crazy and only took 15 minutes? I didn't even know that existed! I came in here to get an Arizona drivers license. Being from California, I expected that it was going to take forever. Boy was I wrong. I walked in and was helped right away. It took a little bit just to get all my paperwork done and then I went to take my picture. They printed my ID out right then and there. Yes Californians you heard me: RIGHT THEN AND THERE. No two to three week waiting period before receiving it in the mail. It was SO nice. Oh and the ladies were super friendly, another thing that never happens at California DMVs. I never thought I would actually enjoy going to the DMV but I can honestly say I did.

What originally made me come here was the show on VH1 about their one of their So Cal locations. I loved this place and will be returning as soon as I'm back from out of town. Hot bartenders, free shots, and a bull? It doesn't get much better than that. We sat at the bar and our server was awesome. He recommended his version of the jalapeño mac and cheese and it was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. We also were given two rounds of free shots which was pretty sweet. They tried to sucker me in to joining the bull riding competition but I didn't end up doing it. I also got a pink cowboy hat here, which was an exciting find. Dishes are a little on the expensive side, but like most people have already said, the portions are very large. I already can't wait to go back to have that mac and cheese again. Try it, you won't regret it.

Went here with a few friends for dinner today. I had never been here before, and I'm almost positive I wouldn't have ventured in here on my own. I'm glad my buddies dragged me in here.  The food is good. You are given a bowl when you are seated and you get to choose the meats, veggies, spices, and sauce for your stir fry. So, basically, if you don't like what you made, its your own dang fault. They have recipes up on the walls if you are super lost. I didn't realize that the meat would shrink once it was cooked (I obviously don't cook often) so I probably could have gotten more. My advice is to stock as much as possible in your bowl.  They have happy hour daily. I believe Bud Light drafts are almost always $2. Can't complain about that.  The bowls are typically around $10 each, so you can get a decent sized meal for like $15. They also have frequent eater cards. Once you buy seven, you get a bowl free. And you also get a free bowl for your birthday.  My friends knew once of the servers, so we were given exceptional service. I am looking forward to eating here again.

Oh Genghis Grill, why can't you open a location in Northern California yet?  Was in town for spring training this past week and I HAD to stop in at Genghis, as it's one of my favorite restaurants in the area. I used to go in at least once a week for the food and my favorite server/bartender Mike. I was happy to see he was still there when we went in and still giving the impecable service he did when I lived out there. If I could steal him and make him move to Cali, I would. He's that good.  I was shocked when I walked in, because they have completely redesigned this location. I thought it was classy and beautiful. The upgrades they have made seem to be working in their favor.  Go in and ask for Mike if he's working. You won't be sorry.

I've been dying to check this place out and I finally did tonight. Apparently we got there right after it had cleared out, so it was just us, another couple, and the bartender, which I loved. The bartender was super friendly and knowledgeable about baseball which I appreciated. As a diehard Red Sox fan, I adored this place. All the gear and memorabilia around the place put a huge smile on my face. The drinks are super cheap as well. I had two Blue Moons and only paid $6. I also heard that Fridays after 9 its $10 for unlimited well drinks and draft beers. On special nights they also fly in Fenway franks, which I think is totally awesome. Since this place is so close to my pad and fits me so perfectly, I will definitely be going back here in the near future.

I love this place. Even someone who isn't a Boston sports fan should like this place. Here's why:  Yes, they serve stiff drinks for low prices. Yes, they have Boston sports memorabilia. Yes, they are a dive bar. These are all givens.  What do they do that sets them apart you ask?  Today I participated in a holiday toy drive. You bring in a toy for less fortunate kids and you get a free drink. I can't think of anything more awesome for the holiday season. I didn't even really want the drink. I just was happy to have the opportunity to help someone in need.  Also, they play Sons of Anarchy every Tuesday night. I can't think of any other bar that does this, and I totally dig it.  Point in case, this bar is different. They do typical bar things, but also go above and beyond for their customers and community.  This is by far my favorite bar, ever, and I've been to quite a few. And I will put my money on the fact that you will love it too.

We stopped here to get a few drinks right before they closed Friday night because it was happy hour. We didn't eat. The drinks on happy hour are dirt cheap. I had a tall beer for $2.50 and my friend had a glass of wine for $4. The server was friendly and funny and wasn't rude to us for going in as late as we did. I need to go back in here and try the food, because I'm sure its delicious.

I ate here for the first time for lunch today. We went in around 2:30pm and the place was dead. We were sat quickly. It took a while for us to be greeted and after waiting for 5 minutes the bartender finally came over to help us. We received super yummy chips and salsa to start off with. I ordered the fish tacos and they were by far some of the best fish tacos I have ever had. I wish they had come with rice and beans or something but it was definitely enough food. Our server was cute and filled my iced tea several times without me asking. I'd definitely eat here again. It looks like a cute place to take a date!

I somehow obtained a coupon for this place so I decided to check it out. I told the gentleman behind the counter that I'd never been there before and asked for his recommendations. I ended up trying the #9 which had roast beef, turkey, swiss, and bacon. They make the roast beef there. Everything was super fresh and yummy and I ended up completely stuffed. They guys that work here are super friendly and they gave me a free cookie since it was my first time. Free stuff always wins me over so I'll definitely be going back next time I'm craving a sub!

Wow I didn't even have to go into the store to experience the terrible customer service. Lord. I called today because I deleted some files on my hard drive that I needed to get back and spoke to a Geek Squad "representative." He was totally rude and unhelpful and basically made me feel extremely stupid. I am so glad I didn't waste my time actually visiting this location, and I won't be doing so any time soon.

In the past, I have spent hundreds of dollars on my hair. I was petrified that I'd go somewhere cheaper and I would come out looking like a poodle or something else unattractive. I'd heard good things about Arizona Hair Co. and that it was actually affordable so I decided to give it a shot. I went in today around 10:30 a.m. and only waited about 10 minutes before a stylist came out to help me. Originally, I was just going to get a trim but I decided when I got there that I wanted a bob. My stylist was lovely. I wish I remembered her name. She was super friendly and gave me honest feedback instead of just taking my original idea and running with it. The end result looks great and I have gotten so many compliments.   Haircut - $15 Styling - $15 Tip - $10 ----------------- Total - $40  I will definitely be going back here to get my hair done by her again!

Oh Cracker Barrel, where have you been in my life? I tried this place for the first time last week and enjoyed everything I ate. The place reminds me of a home in the country. Our waitress was a total doll and one of the cutest old ladies I've ever met. The plates are large and affordable and of course delicious. I had the spicy grilled catfish with green beans, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes and my friend had the country fried steak and eggs. It's home cooking at it's finest. They also have a cute little store up front with nick knacks and old school candy. I don't know what kept me from trying this place sooner, but I'll most definitely be back.

We checked this place out after going to Buffalo Exchange. Its a totally different atmosphere. Its smaller and less busy. The employees are friendly and helpful. Their selection is by far smaller than Buffalo but the stuff they have is better. I didn't see one piece from Forever 21. They have a lot of stuff from Urban Outfitters, American Apparel, and Michael Kors. Their merchandise is also a lot more affordable than Buffalo. I'll definitely go back and check this place out again!

Don't use the cab service at all cost. Its terrible. We called 411 for a cab company today and this is who we got. After nearly 30 minutes of waiting for our car we finally decided to call them. Apparently the driver was at the wrong place. The people over the phone were rude and the cab driver was creepy. When we called to get a cab back, the lady demanded an address. We were at the Target in Tempe Marketplace. Who doesn't know where that is? We ended up calling 411 again to get another, less rude, cab service. Terrible, terrible experience and I definitely will NOT be using this company again.

I needed a fix from getting my nails done in Cali and had no clue where to go here in Tempe. After asking a friend I was told to check this place out. Its extremely clean and well-maintained. I was helped instantly upon entering. The place was bustling with sorority girls and other ladies getting pampered. As soon as I sat down I was given a bottle of water (in this weather that was a huge plus for me). The lady who did my nails was speedy and efficient and fixed the couple of problematic nails from the last time I got my nails done. It was a little more than I would have paid at the other place I went to but they use better products so it ends up being worth it. The pedicure chairs looked mighty comfy and I look forward to returning to get my nails redone and a pedicure in the next couple of weeks. If you are looking for a place to get your nails did in the Tempe area then I would definitely recommend coming here!

I had to update my review and give them another star. I can't get over how fabulous the service is here. I went a couple days ago to get a nail fix and they didn't charge me which really surprised me. They consistently do a good job, regardless of which technician does my nails. I can't wait to go back for a pedi soon!

I can't say enough good things about this place. They always have a ton of employees on so you never need an appointment or have to wait. Everyone that works there is super friendly and no matter who you get they are going to do a great job. They are always busy, which is telling in itself. Great customer service and great work here, which is why I continually go back and have not gotten my nails done anywhere else in Arizona.

This restaurant is beautiful. It's super open and has great decor. We sat up at the bar to have a couple drinks and some appetizers. Everything was delicious, including some of the bartenders. :] They had a DJ up in the booth upstairs playing some music but it wasn't anything overwhelming. The restrooms are interesting. I was lost the first time I tried to use them but figured it out and ended up helping others who were just as lost. Drinks are kind of expensive, but pretty strong. There is a $7 lot behind the restaurant or you can just meter it. I love that it used to be a department store and is now a chic restaurant.  My only quip with this place? Usually when I have a drink, I like to watch some Sportscenter. But I realize it will kill the ambiance to have televisions in here. I just probably wouldn't go here to have a drink at the bar by myself because of it.

Peach mango froyo with fresh fruit = a satisfied tummy. The fruit is all very fresh and delicious and the yogurt is refreshing and cold which is perfect for the Arizona weather. I wish the girls that worked here were a little more friendly but still I will definitely be returning here in the future.

I came in here today with a friend who goes to ASU. I am a prospective student and wanted to get some gear. It is SO much cheaper here AND they carry the Victoria's Secret Pink college line too. I bought a cute white American Apparel v-neck with some ASU stuff on it for $12 and a ASU baseball tee for $15. SO much more affordable than the bookstore and the employees were super friendly!

I shop here frequently due to the fact it's right next to my work. I may stop all together after last night's experience. I went in to buy a bottle of wine and some beer. When I went to pay, I handed the checker my ID and she rejected it. I understood why, apparently in Arizona it's against state laws to accept an ID with a hole punch in it, even if it's from another state. That was no biggie. Honestly I was kind of expecting it. What I wasn't expecting was how rude the lady was. I didn't cause a scene and was actually pretty pleasant about it. She proceeded to scoff at me like I was some underage nuisance trying to illegally buy liquor. She's lucky I'm a nice person in general or I might have given her a piece of my mind.

I love froyo, especially now that I live in a place as hot as Arizona. Mojo satisfies my cravings. They have a mango froyo (my personal favorite) and lots of fresh fruit to choose as toppings. They even have animal cookies! I will continue coming to Mojo whenever I need a yummy, refreshing treat!

I love me some frozen yogurt but I am picky and will usually only get mango which unfortunately they did not have. *Pouts.* So I bit the bullet and got orange instead. It was still very good. The employees were friendly and the interior was super cute. They had big screen televisions playing Christmas movies and super comfy red couches. This place is probably poppin' in the summer. As soon as the heat returns so will I.

I go to this Subway regularly because it is right by the Cronkite school and one of the only food options in the area. The guys that work there are super friendly and they always welcome you into the store. It gets busy around lunch time due to the amount of students that go through here but the employees work fast and you usually aren't waiting for long. I think this location has given me the best service out of any Subway location I've been to and because of that I will continue going here regularly.

This review is just about the venue. I came here for the Jonny Craig show last night. I was expecting a large bar area but that is definitely not the case. It's super tiny. It's very homey, with a small stage area. You can touch the performers as they play. I like smaller venues so it worked for me. It's in the middle of nowhere and there is loads of parking for free in the immediate area. Eat before you come because there is no food in the immediate area. But if you like the smaller venue vibe I'd definitely go see a show here. Oh and bonus points for the big Boston Red Sox banner thats hanging in the bar area.

I went here for the first time last Friday and had a lot of fun. The bartender that helped me, though he was a Jets fan, was super friendly and remembered  my order everytime I went back to get more drinks. The drinks were pretty cheap. I also ordered some tacos that were really good. They have a ton of televisions and a small dance floor, as well as a couple pool tables, a beer pong table, and a cornhole set. It was busy but I was able to move around and enjoy myself. I'd definitely come back here to grab a drink and play some pool or hang out.

My taste buds will forever be thankful that I tried this place. We came in after eating next door because I'd been craving something sweet. The guy behind the counter was wonderful. He was super sweet (no pun intended) and was eager for us to try as many flavors as we wanted. He was very knowledgable about the product and sold us from the minute we walked in. The mango gelato made my knees melt. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend that everyone tries this place.

My friend wanted to come get massages before finals so we came here. For some reason I haven't had a real massage before, and I definitely regret not getting one sooner. Kyle was the masseuse I was given. He was fabulous. Not only was he really nice to look at (I had to say it) but he was professional and knew what he was doing/talking about. I never felt uncomfortable with him once.  As others have said, they are a bit pushy about getting you to sign up for the year membership. For ASU students its $44 a month and you get an hour massage a month as well as other perks. I caved and just did it because I believe it will be really good for my body and for the frequent headaches and migraines I get. Plus school is going to get really stressful and I'm pretty sure I'm going to need it.  Ask for Kyle. You won't regret it.

You know those douchebags that yell and scream at the television and chest bump after every play on Sundays? You can find them here. This is one of the reasons I like this place, because I can be one of those douchebags.  On Sundays it gets PACKED here. My friends snagged a spot early today so I just pulled up a chair to their table. You can hardly walk around the place. Normally this would anger me, but if I can see my football team play I could care less.  They have all the televisions labeled with the games of the day so you can make sure you have a good view of your team's game. From what I've been told, the owner seems to be a Patriots fan, because almost every Sunday that is the game that has the sound streaming. Totally fine by me.  If you are going to watch the Cardinals game, GET THERE EARLY. Or else you will be standing at the entrance squinting at the televisions, waiting for your table to be ready.  Food is typical bar food. They have specials on Sundays on drinks and food so you don't spend a lot of money getting trashed and trash talking the Dallas (or whatever team you despise) fan next to you.  If you like to enjoy a football game without people looking at you like you are crazy, this is the place to go.

I've always wanted to stop in here but never got the chance. I finally checked it out last night after work. They always have something going on here. Wednesday they have karaoke and Sunday they have trivia. Thursdays are two for one drinks and its packed. They also have drink specials every day. We were starving so we ordered a pizza, burger, and wings (the wings were $5 on Sunday). It was all delicious but way too much food. We ended up taking at least half of it home. The service was great. The bartender had great suggestions and was on top of things without being annoying. We are looking forward to going here again for karaoke or trivia!

I was excited to see a Jimmy John's near campus because I thought it was an East Coast thing. That being said I went in today around 12:45. The place was packed and I thought I'd have to wait a few minutes for my sandwich but alas I was wrong. As soon as I received my receipt, my sandwich was being handed to me! Great service during a busy lunch rush which means I will definitely be going back!

I hardly ever give five star reviews. My experience at Culinary Dropout today prompted me to do so. The reason we checked this place out was because I had a 25% coupon from Fox RC for Labor Day. First things first: The employees are extremely good looking. There is lots of tattoos and bare skin. Our bartender was awesome. He answered all our dumb questions with a smile and made some killer drinks. I had the Bacon Infused Bloody Mary and my friend had the Acai Mojito. I will be going back again to have that Bloody Mary. It was SO good. We started out with the homemade chips and onion dip and it was delicious. We pretty much filled up on those before we got our meals. I ordered the Havarti Burger, my roommate got the chef salad, and my other friend got the canneloni. Everything was super good, but it was too much food! My burger melted in my mouth and I kept stealing bites of my friend's salad. So, in a nutshell:  - Great vibe. - Great food. - Great drinks. - Hot employees. - Clever menu titles/ - Great experience!

I had a pretty great experience here and I felt inclined to write about it. I went in looking for a top for an important interview I had and the service the woman gave me was impeccable. I went to purchase the blouse I had found (and adored) and a white tank top to wear underneath it. She quickly told me that there was a buy one get one 50% sale and that one of my items didn't fulfill the sale. She directed me to a tank top that did indeed work and I was floored by her honesty and assistance. The only thing that kept me from giving a five star review was the other guy working. He wasn't friendly or personable and didn't acknowledge me at all when I was roaming around. It was kind of a bummer. In general, the service was really great and I look forward to going back.

I wanted a spray tan to look hot for my birthday and didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount of money to get one. I found a coupon to get a $10 one here so I jumped on it. The young lady working behind the counter was extremely friendly and chatted me up. She didn't pressure me into getting a membership but did let me know of the opportunities they had available. The only quip I had with the experience was that the towel I was given to wipe down afterwards was super teeny. Besides that it was a pleasant experience and I'd go back again.

After trying to order my pizza from Dominos and being unsuccessful, I turned to Pizza Hut. They helped me right away and I ended up getting more food for less money. They also delivered my food within a half an hour and it was hot and ready to eat when I got it. The delivery guy was very friendly and warm as well. I ordered their wings for the first time today and they were super yummy. I definitely will be ordering Pizza Hut from now on and will be ordering wings from them again on the 50 cent wing night.

I have died and gone to heaven. This place is a total dream for me. Televisions EVERYWHERE (including outside) playing different sporting events and juicy, meaty wings. Sure the service isn't all that great but with a ball game on and a beer in your hand you can't really go wrong. This place totally fills up for ASU games so get there early. It's a great environment to hang out and watch a game!

I finally saw a show here this week. We went to see The Ghost Inside and Redeemer and both really enjoyed the show and the venue. It's very intimate. You can get up in the musicians' faces and scream or sing along with them. It is actually underground as well, which was really cool.  Pros: -Intimate experience -Cheap tickets -Underground (no pun intended) bands play here -Lots of free parking nearby -Ins and outs  Cons: -No bar  They do not serve liquor, but the people working the door will gladly direct you to the nearest bar, which is only a few blocks away.  I like dive-y venues, so I really enjoyed this one. I'm definitely planning on going back to see another show here in the future.

It's a little hard to review a place when you don't actually see the bill. That being said, I enjoyed it here. We sat up at the bar and ordered drinks. They only have a small selection of beers on draft but that's not a huge deal to me. They had the ones that matter: dos equis and blue moon. I ordered the blackened salmon. It was incredibly flavorful but I was a little surprised at how small the plate was when I received it. It tasted really good though, and thats all that really matters. The hostess at the door was very sweet and helpful, as my date ran a little late and I was sitting there waiting for a bit. I would really like to go back here on a Sunday after and enjoy the $10 unlimited mimosas or bloody marys deal. All and all the place is clean, classy, and very open and the service was good so I'd definitely be back.

I work at a restaurant and therefore I am painfully aware of what good service is. Dan gave it to myself and my friends from the minute we walked in the door. He was friendly, hospitable, and gave some of the best service I've had in a long time. Besides his great service, the food was incredible. The dirty chips were taste bud heaven and the chicken sandwich made me drool. If the food and service isn't enough, they give a discount to other people in the industry on Sunday nights. You can't beat RnR for a good time, delicious food, and wonderful service.

I have to admit, I'm not usually a JCPenney shopper. Today, however, I needed to purchase an outfit for an interview and felt I would have the most luck here. I was correct. I found a nice blouse for $14, tights for $7, and killer pumps for $30 (my splurge of the day) for the occasion. Besides finishing my interview attire, I found a cute zebra-print romper for $4 dollars. Yes you heard me correctly, FOUR DOLLARS. I also found an adorable tank top for another outrageous $2. Head in there this weekend, they are having a killer Labor Day sale and it's totally worth it. Oh and on top of that the employees were super friendly AND there is a Sephora inside. I never thought I'd say this but I might shop at this JCPenney again.

I love this boutique. The ladies that work there are super friendly and they have a ton of cute clothes as well as Steve Madden shoes and purses. I got a cute LBD and a shirt for $60. Oh and they give you heels to wear while you try on the dresses. I love it. They also have really good customer service. We went in right before they closed last week and they didn't ask us to leave or act rudely towards us. This is why we went back and will continue to go back!  Right now they have a parents weekend sale going on: jeans are buy one get one free.

We loved this place. It makes it better when you have connections and can get it for free, obviously, but I would have enjoyed it here even if I had to pay. It was also one of the only clubs we went to where the gentleman in the group were also not forced to pay. We went to see Steve Aoki and it was awesome. There were tons of people there dancing and having a great time. I kept expecting someone to fall into the pool in the middle but didn't get the pleasure of seeing it. I would love to get one of the rooms up top that overlook the strip as well as the club. The drinks were expensive but not as bad as XS. This was my first experience with house music and I have to say after coming here I am a fan.

Good drink specials and cheap food. It doesn't get much better than that. They have tall Miller Lite drafts for $2.75. We  ordered a huge plate of nachos. It was $10 and the five of us still couldn't finish it. We also ordered several shots of patron which were $6 a piece. They have tons of televisions playing sports and pool tables as well. Its a great place to drink and eat bar food and watch the game.

I had a great time here. We made a large reservation in advance and they were very accomodating. There ended up being more people than we originally thought and they took great care of us.  The service was good, especially from the owner/manager. He made sure to ask us how everything was and shake our hands when we left which I found really refreshing. The server took a while to bring our check, but we were having such a good time talking it really didn't matter.  The atmosphere was great as well. They had a flamenco dancer there and the ladies and I really enjoyed oogling him over the course of the night. He also would teach you how to dance if you wanted to and dragged the two birthdays in our party up on stage to dance with them. He was definitely a highlight of the night.  The food was absolutely delicious. I had one of their specials for the day, which was basically a seafood chippino with a side of safron rice. If I could have, I would have licked the bowl clean the sauce was so good. The bread and dip they give you at the beginning of the meal are also very good. It's really easy to fill up on them. I tried the eggplant and crab tapas my friend got and they were so good. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food as well.  The only issue I had here was the bathroom. It wasn't stocked and could have been cleaner.  Besides that, the experience here was pretty wonderful and I'm already planning on dragging some of my friends and family back here.

We came here on last night for the first time. The service was absolutely fantastic. Haylee was absolutely adorable, super bubbly, and really friendly. She made sure we had everything we needed and did it with a smile. We started out with the nachos which were some of the best nachos I have ever had. They make their own chips and cheese sauce and both are delectable. Unfortunately, a bug decided to join our nacho party, which is the only reason I am giving this place four stars instead of five. Me and my friend both did the Tuesday night special, which comes with a glass of wine, a sandwich (burgers and wraps included) and a side salad for $10. After all the yummy nachos, we were pretty full and couldn't finish our meals. I got the bacon burger and it was really good. They used the same cheese sauce as the nachos so I was on cheese overhaul. We also ordered the brownie sundae and peach cobbler for dessert. The brownie was super yummy, but I was a little disappointed in the cobbler. I love where it is located. You barely notice it. It's tucked away on the corner and I almost felt like I was in the woods somewhere. I will be back to hang out with Haylee and eat those nachos again, as well as try some of their other daily specials.

I rarely eat something and wish that I had an even bigger portion. This was one of those occasions. My family was in town from the east coast and this restaurant was right across from the hotel they were staying at, the Sheraton. The decor is very swanky. The servers were cute and friendly. Both myself and my aunt ordered the lunch special: half a pizza and a salad for $9.95. The dressing on the salad was delicious. The pizza was to die for. It had no sauce, tomatoes, avocados, cheese, and onions. By far one of the best pizzas I have ever tasted. I'm salivating just thinking about it. I'd definitely go back here! Yummy.

This is going to be my new go-to place for football on Sundays and any other important games I want to watch. Today was the opening day of this location. They were pretty busy but still managed to provide good service. Me and my guy friends sat up at the bar to watch the 49ers game. Because it was opening day, my buddy got unlimited Bud Lights FOR FREE. Yes you heard me correctly. FOR FREE. The employees at this location are super friendly and outgoing. They seemed to really enjoy working at a sports bar and bantered and cheered with us. The location is perfect. Right off Rural and University and walking distance from both my apartment and school. Cheers to Joe (cute bartender who served me) and Madison (server who came over and chatted up my boys) for being so friendly and welcoming. I can't wait to go back here Sunday morning to watch some football.  Oh only bummer is that button thing they have in the commercials isn't real. We wanted overtime in the game and they couldn't provide. SHUCKS!

My friend's band played here on Friday and I would have never even known it was here if it wasn't for that. They have really good looking staff (men and women), good drink specials, a ton of space to mingle or dance, plenty of televisions showing all the sports events, and a stripper pole. The night I was there they had two "mystery beers." They were $3 each and if you guessed correctly what type of beer it was, the drink was free. I've heard they have a Grateful Dead cover band here on Thursday nights that I am definitely going to have to check out. The band I was there to see totally dug the venue and said it had some of the best sound they had experienced. They also have an outdoor stage for during the winter months. I'd definitely go see another live show here in the future.

I totally dig this place. The ambiance, the food, and the bartenders all work for me. Dulia, a bartender, is a total doll. Their margaritas are strong and decently priced. They do have food, but the menu is small. Me and my friend shared two appetizers: the fish tacos and the quesadilla, and an order of onion rings and were happily stuffed and it only cost us $10 each. Once it gets later this place totally fills up and people dance, drink, and have a good time. The sinks being outside of the bathrooms is kind of odd but not really a big deal. Its totally worth checking out if you are on Mill.

I am going to start this review off with a disclaimer: I have been an athlete all my life. Today I finally decided to check out the women's cardio kickboxing class that they offer here Monday-Friday from 4:30-5:30. Man was I in over my head. This workout was by far the most intense I have ever experienced. Even with my athletic abilities, I was unable to do the whole class without sitting out a few times because I felt like I was going to pass out. Jordan, the teacher, was super encouraging and told me that most people took a few classes to actual complete the entire class without stopping which made me feel so much better. It is all women, which also made me feel better, but the guys from the class after it do come early and stare as you pant, sweat, and turn red. I am definitely going to try this class again, but only after a few days for my body to recover.  I would give it five stars but when I had spoken to Spencer, the office manager, he had told me that the first class was no charge. Unfortunately, I had to pay the $10 even though it was my first time. Besides that this class is great for women who are trying to get into shape. Just don't underestimate how hard its going to be. It definitely is a workout.

I can honestly say that this place had some of the worst service I have ever had. Our server, Nicole/Nikki was absolutely awful. You know the service is bad when you see all their other tables looking around for their server and looking generally disgruntled. We asked several times for things that we ordered with our meal and didn't receive them. I literally filled my own water with the water bottle I had because no one would fill our waters. The other servers were hanging out by the computers and not helping anyone in the restaurant, which was super frustrating. My burger was alright. The bun was super hard (almost inedible) and I didn't get the mushrooms I ordered on it so it was really disappointing. The side salad I got, however, was really good. I'm not sure what kind of dressing it had but it was delicious. I'm not quite sure why but we were given popcorn at the beginning of the meal. I would give this place another chance because it did have some redeeming qualities, but I would hope to have a more friendly and competent server next time.

We came here for a pool party during the day. It was super packed and we had to wait a little bit to get in. The club itself is beautiful. The pool is lined with palm trees and they have awesome glass jacuzzis. They also sell food (not sure how good it is). The bartenders were the only disappointment. They weren't very friendly and steadfastly ignored my requests to close my tab several times. The weather was perfect when we there, which really added to the experience. I'd definitely come back here to another pool party and to check it out at night as well.

I have a huge sweet tooth. This place is like heaven for me. They always have coupons and if you get a stamp card you get a free 1/4 pound after you buy five. They have all the candies you used to love as a kid. They also have chocolate, PEZ, salt water taffy, and pretty much any other candy you could think of. This place is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I will continue going back when I'm strolling Mill Avenue.

I'm a poor college student, therefore, I don't eat at places this nice very often. We came in last night around 8. The room is very spacious and beautifully decorated with a nice ambiance. The service kind of confused me, because I'm used to servers wanting you in and out as soon as possible. Here, they get your drink order, then get your appetizer order. They don't get your meal order until AFTER you finish your appetizer, just in case you change your mind after eating the appetizer. The head chef, I believe, of the restaurant personally delivered our appetizer and chatted us up for a good 15 minutes. We got the pork belly as our appetizer and it was really good, basically melted in your mouth. I ordered the AZ BLT and my friend ordered the grilled halloumi cheese. Both were REALLY good. The BLT came with homemade bacon and the cheese on the grilled cheese was super tasty. I ended up switching sandwiches with my friend because I enjoyed the halloumi cheese more! We finished off the meal with the bread pudding which, like everything else, was absolutely fabulous. I'd give the restaurant five stars, but the drink orders took FOREVER. This was there only downfall. Besides that, I would definitely return, especially to check out the sexy, bald bartender with the tattoos.

A place after my own heart. From the parking lot, I could see the Boston sports memorabilia and I was already a fan. Then we talked to the guys who own it, who the people I was with were good friends with, and they were such great guys. The food was so good. We had the garlic knots, mozzarella sticks, and then pizzas. I was stuffed upon leaving, but I was a happy camper. They also had televisions playing college football, which made the experience even better.  The only this that could have made this experience top notch? If they served beer. I was dying for one with the delicious pizza. But besides that, I definitely give this place an A, and will try to go back next time I am in town.

Me and a friend went here for lunch today. We got here before the rush which was definitely a good idea. They filled up with businessmen and women around noon.  The staff was super friendly and good looking (seems to be a FOX thing). I liked their outfits: crisp, white button down shirts and a tie, jeans, and Converse.   The food was really good and came out in a timely manner. My friend got the special which was a pork sandwich w/fries and I got the fish sandwich w/a side salad. My sandwich was really tasty. The fish was flaky and the sauce it came with was delectable. The salad came pretty much dry so I had to ask for extra dressing, which I received promptly and tasted really good. My friend enjoyed her sandwich. I really liked her fries as well, which are made fresh there (think elevated In and Out fries). My strawberry lemonade was really yummy too, but unfortunately, didn't come with free refills.  I loved the interior, like I do most FOX restaurants. My favorite part was a room off to the side that had comfy looking tables with nice booths and a ton of pictures all over the walls.  I'd definitely go back here, especially for a business meeting or possibly a first date.

I've been meaning to check this place out, but its in Scottsdale and that's not usually where I go out. Last night we ended up here after going to a couple other bars in Oldtown.  It was pretty packed and we had to wait outside for like 10 minutes before they let us in but it was worth it.  The first thing we noticed when we walked in was Steve Nash chilling with some guys. I wouldn't have expected him at a place like this but it was really cool. They also had Mr. T upstairs dancing with a bunch of women.  Drinks are cheap. We got a couple mixed drinks and a couple beers for $14. Bartenders are cute and friendly from what I saw.  They had two girls up on the bar with a beer bong and I thought that was awesome. I didn't participate, but it was fun watching other people do it.  We got there kind of late, so it ended up clearing out a little bit and we were able to get our grove on. The whole vibe of the place was just really cool. I ended up having a blast here and I'm definitely planning on going back next weekend!

Went in here today for a consult with Lauren regarding getting extensions put in. I was a little apprehensive because I have gone to the same place for years but seeing that my old salon is a state away I figured I needed to look at other options. Lauren was great. Extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and not the least bit pushy. The salon itself is beautiful. Its super open with comfy chairs and televisions so you aren't twiddling your thumbs while you wait. She didn't push me to make an appointment right away which really put me at ease. For now she will be doing a touch-up and a cut for me which I will definitely Yelp about after the appointment. On a first impression based review, I find this salon welcoming and well- kept. And I am expecting nothing but the best at my appointment!

Alright here's the update I promised. I went today to get my hair dyed and cut from Lauren. I got there 30 minutes early so I decided to get my eyebrows done as well. The lady who did my eyebrows (I wish I had gotten her name) was wonderful. I'm usually a huge baby when it comes to getting them waxed but she was so gentle. She actually took the time to find out what I wanted first, instead of just doing her thing. All in all the end result was better than I could have asked for.  After getting my eyebrows waxed I went upstairs to get my hair done. Again, Lauren was great. She definitely exceeded my expectations. My hair looked fabulous at the end. When she was done, my face was still a bit red from the waxing and she took the time to redo my makeup. Great, great service and I can't wait to go back.  A word of advice. Book your appoint in advance and you get $5 off your services!

This place is a disaster and a half. The word "rude" to describe the hostess was an understatement. The kitchen couldn't handle a rush to save their life. My server got my order wrong as well as the table next to me. I waited nearly 45 minutes for a salad. One redeeming thing is that the food was actually quite good once I got it. This place may have been great if  it wasn't busy, but they were going down in flames when I ate there. My advice? Stay far away if they are busy. Check it out if you aren't in a hurry to catch a flight or it isn't packed.

Don't eat here. The employees are incompetent. I clearly asked for no onions or mayo on my sandwich and got home to find that both were on there. Their job is not that difficult. I don't understand how someone can screw up something so simple. They are lucky I'm not allergic to onions or else things could have been way worse. I won't be eating here again.

My friend and I have been waiting for this place to open, because it looked so good. We finally went today and weren't disappointed. It is very similar to Paradise Bakery (price and food wise), but in my opinion is better. They have sandwiches, salads, soups, pastas, and paninis. Both of us got the chicken pomodori and it was SO good. Super flavorful and filling. This place gets super busy, but there is a ton of space so you won't have trouble finding a place to sit. They will bring your food to your table and also grab your plates when you are done. Great food and good service. We will most definitely be going back.

Have you ever wished you were morbidly obese? You would if you went here. If you are over 350 pounds (no lying, they weigh you in the middle of the restaurant) then you eat for free.   You walk in and are greeted by a hot girl dressed as a nurse. Every guy's dream right? And then said nurse helps you into a hospital gown, which you are required to wear throughout your meal.  They have burgers, fries, shakes, and liquor. That is all. If you are expecting more, you will be disappointed. Everything is calorie-filled and tasty, and you won't leave hungry. The shakes have a pad of butter on top and are around 2000 calories.  They only take cash but have an ATM in the restaurant with a small 75 cent service fee.  If you don't get a heart attack from eating their food, you will definitely get one from looking at the waitresses.  This is definitely a fun place to go if you are in town, but I definitely wouldn't come here on a regular basis, unless I wanted to gain a bazillion pounds.

This is one of my favorite places to eat downtown during school. Their salads are huge and super affordable. One with chicken is only $7. They also make smoothies that are all fruit for $5. The people that work there are super friendly and are always quick to give you their recommendations. It's in a great location and is very accessible for students. Because of that and the great food and prices, I will definitely be coming back here often during the semester.

I love this place. We were looking for a place to clean our cars and stumbled upon it. It is a mix of hand washing and a machine, so it's very thorough. The prices are very affordable as well. $7 for the extra stuff and $5 for just a general wash. They also offer a $1 off discount to college students, which is always nice. It took less than 10 minutes, and my car looked great for weeks after. It's definitely the place to go when you are looking for a quick, thorough car wash. It doesn't hurt that the gentlemen that work here are really good looking too! :]

I loved this place. We were looking to watch the wild card games somewhere and other places were packed so we ended up here. They had great music playing and an even better happy hour. The margaritas were buy one get one and the appetizers were all half off. The bartenders were really great as well, super friendly and outgoing. I'd definitely come back here again.

I have avoided urgent care centers like the plague, thinking they'd be total steps down from going to the ER. Man was I wrong. I've been in twice in the past month for totally separate issues. Both times I was the only one in the building and was helped immediately. The front desk ladies are sweet, friendly, and very helpful. I have Kaiser, which is a medical care center located only in California, and always worry that places in Arizona won't take my insurance. Not only did they take mine, but they also didn't make me pay a copay. Both of the doctors I had were very knowledgeable and provided me with the correct medicine to fix my issue. I didn't feel uncomfortable at all and wasn't left waiting in the room for hours on end. It was actually a pleasant experience for how awful I felt. I'm definitely going to go here from now on when I have a medical issue.

I've only been to a Ruby Tuesday once in my life and that was in Upstate New York. Yesterday I needed to eat somewhere close to my work and this was the closest option.  To start, when I walked in the door the first thing the host said was, "Who are you?" I have been hosting and working in a restaurant since I was 16 and I've never ever said that to someone. It was really rude.  My buddy was sitting at the bar so I went to sit with him (insert evil glare from the hostess here). They had the Red Sox game on so I couldn't really complain. The server was good, but I noticed she was doing her homework behind the bar. I needed water a couple of times and didn't get it because she was distracted. I know how these businesses run and I would never allow my employee to do their homework where someone could see, or at all for that matter.  Food was good. I had the chicken fresco with mac and cheese and a salad. The salad was disgusting and wilted but the rest of the food was pretty tasty.  A couple other things I disliked about my experience here: they were cleaning the restaurant in front of the customers. I don't mean just cleaning the dirty tables, but getting on their hands and knees and scrubbing parts of the restaurant. I nearly knocked a guy over walking out of the restroom. I realize they were slow but it turned me off a bit. Also, the other employees were talking about tables right in front of me. They could have refrained from that and filled my water that was empty right in front of me. They were also eating right in front of me which I find unsanitary and unprofessional.  In a nutshell, the food was this place's only saving grace, but I am not going to go running back anytime soon. They are a little better than Applebee's but not much.

I worked at Hohokam for spring training a couple years back. The stadium has a lot of history, but the Cubs definitely were due for an upgrade. This ballpark is beautiful.  Pros: - Ample parking ($10) - Affordable tickets - Shade! Hallelujah! - Rotating food trucks mmmmm - Wrigley-like sign that you can add scrolling text to and take pictures with it for free - Lots of lawn space - It has distinct similarities to Wrigley - Across the street from a bunch of restaurants, bars - Dos Gringos bar  Cons: - I can't really think of any to be honest  Love, love, love this park. Look forward to going back to games here in the future. Nice work Cubs, nice work.
