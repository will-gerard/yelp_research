Server was cool. Beers took awhile to get. Food took also a lot longer than expected. Chips weren't fully fried. Brought me the wrong burrito... But whatever. I'm trying to give this place a good rating but it wasn't what I expected. Won't come here again unfortunately... A lot of other great Mexican food around the area.

Well, I'm gonna be honest. The service is good. The food is bad. Sauces taste nasty. meat is not the freshest. The prices are ridiculous. 4 dollars for a bean and chez burrito?????  I'm sorry I would rather have a filbertos in this place.... at least I know that I'm gonna eat bad food. Just bc the "guy" shows up 5 years ago doesn't mean you have good food now. Redo the menu and prices. No Beuno.

Well, I just have to say.... This place was a real find. Yes there is very gorgeous girls who work here.. But the hair cut was exactly the way j wanted it, perfectly done. The stylist took her time and was a really nice girl. Hands down.. The best place in the east vally to get ur hair lookin nice.  They have tvs at every seat... Sports playin so you can relax and enjoy. 10 out of 10. Just make sure you get the girl with the beautiful blue green eyes... Youll know exactly who she is ;)

I love the food and the prices it's very fair and the best begel shop in the valley... But ever since the owner hired a bunch of young kids i haven't wanted to go back... The kids have messed up my order 3 out of four times and they all have attitudes when you go in. I want the owner to come back and run it again.
