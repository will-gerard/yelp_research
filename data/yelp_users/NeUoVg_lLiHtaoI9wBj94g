The meat and cheese board is one of the best deals in town, and I love the Pizza Rustica! Real, authentic pizza.

I enjoyed my breakfast which was the crab and avocado omelet. I'm leaving with a bad taste in my mouth. After my fianc√© asked if it was cheaper to order mimosas individually if she was only going to have two versus the bottomless mimosas for $15, I was charged $18 for two. When I asked the waiter if he could change it to the $15 price (since bottomless was only $15 and two was supposed to be cheaper than that) he replied that this was how his manager told him to charge me. So if you are having thoughts on having two mimosas, that is more than bottomless!
