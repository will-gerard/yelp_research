I have had a couple of really great experiences at Pizzeria Bianco so far. I really enjoy the menu. I think the staff is great. They have a couple of locations, which is really nice.   Surprisingly, I wasn't so thrilled with the pizza. It was just "okay" both times. I've tried the Rosa and the Margarita and both left me feeling like I was lacking. However, the fresh mozzarella salad is amazing and I get it every time. I would certainly recommend people to this place.

Wow, was I excited to have breakfast here! Unfortunately, we didn't have the greatest experience. I've heard so many good things about Bouchon and I expected this breakfast to blow my mind...but no.  We took a couple of clients to Bouchon for a meeting and to be honest, the waiter was a bit snobby and uptight. He seemed annoyed by us. He was really short and quick with us and didn't seem warm and welcoming at all.   I ordered the French Toast and I was hugely disappointed. It was just not delicious. I can't believe this, but it wasn't seasoned well. It didn't really taste sweet at all. It was just sort of a bland, mushy type of flavor. Also, my french toast tasted like it was pre-made and heated to order, rather than fresh. So sad!   I had a side of sausage, which was okay. They tasted barely heated through as well. Not fresh. My colleagues ordered eggs, hash, etc. and none of them had anything great to say either. All in all a huge let down. I was expecting something reminiscent of the French Laundry, and I got something that didn't even really rival Denny's, sad to say.  Now this might be harsh, maybe I caught a bad dish or a bad day. I'll probably go back, but this was sincerely the experience I had.

If you're in Vegas you should probably head over to Joe's and check it out. VERY GOOD New York style pizza.   I like that you can order pizza by the slice and that they are super big. You only need 1 or 2 slices in order to be really satisfied. The only downside that I can see is the staff. Not very nice. I mean, it's NY style pizza, so that sort of comes with the territory, but it would be nice if they'd pay a little closer attention to what you're saying. They take your order and then just sort of say "pepperoni" when it's ready. Anybody could really just walk up and take your slice. Not a great system.  However, the food is great. Check out this great slice of pizza just off the strip!

We really enjoyed this place. We went back twice over a 4 day period for breakfast. Our team went back a third time as well. It's not really anything special, but the food is special.   Babystacks offers a lot of great different kinds of pancakes, which are amazing. In addition, their savory items are pretty top notch as well. I tried the Cinnabun pancakes (amazing) and the Red Velvet pancakes (very good). Also, I had the Portuguese sausage with white rice and eggs.  I have a feeling everything on the menu is good, so give it a try.

This is the best BBQ I've ever had. Period.  This was just one of those chance happenings upon. We were in Phoenix for business and Yelped a place to eat. We saw Little Miss BBQ and thought we'd give it a shot.   There was a line out the door and everyone in line had great things to say about the place. They were right. I ordered the fatty brisket, pulled pork, sausage, jalepeno grits, coleslaw, and a bottled coke. If you ask me, that was about as close to a perfect meal as it gets. This BBQ really reminds me of Franklin's in Austin. Just a salt and pepper rub. Smoked simply and perfectly. Nice people. Little place to sit. All in all a perfect BBQ experience.   Anytime I'm in Phoenix I will be returning.

Not the greatest hotel experience I've had. I think the location is what does it in. It's just out in the middle of nowhere in sort of a sketchy neighborhood. I didn't feel unsafe by any means, but it just wasn't that great of a location.  The service was fine. However, the room wasn't the cleanest. I found hairs all over the bathroom and bed. Pretty gross.
