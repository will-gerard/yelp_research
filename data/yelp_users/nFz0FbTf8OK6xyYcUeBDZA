I pass by this JITB twice a day on my commute. Every once in a while, I decide to give them yet another try to see if their food quality and service have improved.  Today I went there and ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl. I was, yet again, dissapointed. I've had this same dish at another location (99th Ave and Thunderbird), where the veggies are bright and the rice is fluffy. The bowl I received today was a sad, sad misrepresentation of this JITB product.   The broccoli was so overcooked that it was dark green clumps of mush mixed into the mushy rice. The carrot strips were ok (can you really mess those up?) and the chicken was dry, but edible. I ended up fishing out the broccoli nastiness along with the inedible rice, which left me with 4 strips of dry chicken and a tiny pile of julienne carrots.   I won't give this location another try. Their customer service is horrible to-boot, and doesn't even kind of make up for their disgusting food. The manager should take a serious look into what his/her chefs are doing there, because they certainly aren't making food.

Very helpful employees--really know their stuff!  I go in constantly with stupid questions, and they never laugh at me. Even though a new Autozone recently opened closer to me, I will still go to this location.

Absolutely horrible. I've had bad service at other IHOP locations, but this particular location receives a gold medal for Worst Service EVER.   I was told the wait would be 15 minutes max, and 30 minutes later my party was seated. The sodas were flat and warm (ICK!), so the waitress exchanged them for "fresh" ones, which were also flat and warm. We settled for water and coffee..can't go wrong there, I suppose, except for the water glasses had bits of food stuck to them from  The food took an absurdly long time to come out. When it did, we were all disappointed:  Friend's pancakes included several black hairs inside of the pancake. My side of ranch was obviously old with a yellow tinge and sour taste. My breakfast sandwich was drenched in butter. Other friend's pancakes were so soggy in the middle that they kind of congealed together. Everyone's breakfast sausage was dry and bland.  For specializing in pancakes and being known for their breakfast dishes, this place sucked. I won't be spending my money here again, EVER.

Visited this place before getting coffee. I had a plain bagel with cream cheese and my husband had their pretzel bunned hot dog. We were both satisfied, and will definitely come back again.

This location is the worst around. The baristas were rude and pushy with their products. When I refused to buy their nasty tea or over priced coffee the cashier became overly sarcastic and short with us.  While waiting for our drinks, the baristas loudly bad mouthed a coworker and one even went as far as to talk about cutting the hated girl's hours so they didn't have to work with her as much. Not professional, not impressive, just plain rude and off-putting.  The inside dining area is small, crowded, and disgusting. The girls could spend less time talking trash about their fellow coworkers and more time doing what they're being paid to do.   The outside dining area is mismatched (not in an attractive way) and is reminiscent of walking through crap at a yard sale.   I won't be returning here and I won't be recommending this location to anyone.

Went here on a Sunday afternoon, and only one employee was working. The line was long, but she kept her attitude up and got through everyone's orders flawlessly.   Clean restaurant, clean bathrooms, good lacation.

I asked a business near Chang Lee's if they would recommend their food, and everyone said yes. I was greeted immediately upon entering Chang Lee's by two less than enthusiastic waitresses. I ordered take out (sweet & sour pork, fried rice, and a coke).  While waiting in the lobby, I noticed several displeasing things. There was a half full coffee carafe in a soda/water mini fridge, their fish tank had scum all over the inside with little foliage or rock (these help de-stress fish), and their TV was set to Unsolved Mysteries--not exactly an appetizing show.  I received my food and headed back to work. The soda tasted...dirty. I don't know how it is possible, but my Coca Cola in a Styrofoam cup tasted as if there were dust or dirt in it. I couldn't even choke it down.  The pork wasn't bad, good flavor, but very fatty. The rice was nothing special, just a filler by far. Hardly any veggies or egg included in it.   I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Great, hardworking employees offer fast and friendly service. They are pleased to help with any inquiries and take their time, even if the line is getting long.   The place is well maintained, with little to no trash lying about.   The parking lot is tiny, and entering/exiting the parking lot can be a pain.

I recommend this company and location as often as possible!  I went for my first time ever waxing earlier this year at this location. I was extremely nervous to have my lady bits waxed, but my esthetician was very professional and made me comfortable.   The facility is very clean, modern, and classy and the receptionists are friendly and bubbly.

I want to like this restaurant. I've been here twice and each time I'm disappointed. This time I had the French onion soup and meatball sliders. The soup was very salty, so much so that I could not get two swallows down. The sliders were okay, nothing over the top or impressive. The meatballs had good.seasoning, but the slider lacked sauce completely.   The waitstaff are always friendly and accommodating, but slack in customer service after you've been seated. We were promised our check and a to-go box and waited nearly 20 minutes for our waitress to appear again, only to have forgotten both.   I won't be coming back to Uncle Bears.
