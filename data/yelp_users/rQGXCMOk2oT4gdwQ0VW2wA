This was our 7 year wedding anniversary and we had  very high hopes of having a wonderful time. The grounds themselves are gorgeous, and the hotel is kept up very well.  The problem lied in the staff. When we came back from breakfast, our room was being cleaned with the French doors propped open by the housekeeper's cleaning cart. There is a specific sign that says to please not leave the doors open because bugs get in, and indeed they did as we had both dead and live bugs including a baby lizard!  While at the pool, my husband went up to ask for our tab as we wanted to leave, and the server was apparently having a terrible day. He lit up my husband about what a terribly run place this bar is, and how they were out of everything, computers down, & a litany of profanity in expressing his dismay at having to work there! We could not believe this, and were taken aback.  We asked that are covers be turned down on our final evening there, as there were yellow stains on the comforter. While it seems that the sheets were changed, the same yellow stains were on the comforter after they cleaned the room.  There were other issues, I won't bore you with the details, we did make the front desk aware of the entire list and she did deduct $75 off of our stay of 3 nights, but that didn't make up for the ridiculous charges and abuse we endured while being there. The parking charge of $15 per day is also absurd, especially since we took other means of transportation everywhere we went during our stay.  While the grounds are beautiful, I would appreciate going to a place that is was not as unprofessional as they were here, including some snide remarks made by the valets, in an attempt to be funny.   I fully expected management to call me the next day after my list of gripes, however our business was apparently not important enough for them to do so. I also suspect that the front desk person did not even convey these to management, which we did ask to speak to before we left, but were told she was not in.  There are plenty of other gorgeous resorts in Paradise Valley and Scottsdale who will receive our business in the future.

Awful. Got here around 9 on Saturday morning, two other parties were seated right after we were. We ordered a sandwich and one coffee. Until I reminded her, we didn't get cream for the coffee. All of the other parties got their food well ahead of ours. I finally asked the waitress  what was going on, she said she wondered the same thing, and another 5 minutes later she came out with the sandwich that we ordered, at least 30 minutes after we ordered it. The French fries that were supposed to come with it and the sauerkraut that we added as a side for the sandwich were missing, she said she was waiting for a fresh order of french fries and didn't want sandwich to sit in the window and get cold any longer. We said we wanted to sauerkraut FOR the sandwich, and if it was not ready we didn't want the entire meal whatsoever. We left. For $15.79, for a sandwich alone, we expected a much larger sandwich and better service than what we got. An apology would have been nice, however we didn't receive that either. No wonder this place is putting out deals to attract more people.

First, thank you Wendy for reaching out and letting us give Chompie's another chance.  It was great!  Food was superb (lots of leftovers to boot!), service was excellent and we will definitely be back.  Thank you for changing our minds about Chompie's!!  Regards, Rachelle

I love Brighton and have been buying their products for years.  When I met my now-husband 5 years ago, he also started buying me their luggage, shoes, loads of handbags, earrings, watches, you name it.  We've always had a great experience at the Fashion Square location but this one at Kierland stinks. The associates always seem put out to help you, even if you're buying and not returning!  When I walk in there wearing their pieces from head to toe, I expect to be treated like I matter. I was not.  This is about the 5th time we've bought here and have only continued to do so after the other 4 crummy experiences because it's the closest one to our North Scottsdale home. However, we'll make the extra drive to old town from now on, so we can be treated like our money and we as people have actual value from now on. In an economy where luxury items like $350 handbags and $250 casual shoes aren't a commodity, these reps need to realize that they should appreciate their customers and our patronage!  Get it together, Brighton.

After my last experience, I'd vowed not to shop here again...so glad I changed my mind!!  My experience last week was one of the best I've ever had in any retail arena.  As soon as we walked in, the associates were welcoming, helpful, and very, very warm and helpful. We exchanged a handbag that was just too large for me, and the rep (can't remember her name, sorry!  Very pretty lady with long blondish-brown hair and a super personality!) was just the best in helping me find other things to replace the bag.  We ended up with a transformer necklace that I just love, a ring  and necklace that are just perfect.  Thank you, Brighton, for giving me the 100% perfect experience I am used to receiving, and for a staff that really "gets it" and cares!  Love you guys!!!!

We've tried giving this place the benefit of the doubt so many times, and now we're just over it. We won't be returning.  The service is terrible, whether it's slow or busy in there.  Came around 4:30 after a movie, a few tables in the bar area but most were finishing up.  Server took about 10 mins. to come and get our drink order. Finally brought our soft drinks, but no chips/salsa. We ordered a cheese crisp (very good) and it came out about 2 mins. after the chips/salsa finally came.  We split a combo dinner, which was very tasty. We needed drinks refilled but that didn't happen until we flagged down the server.  Never checked on us to see how anything tasted or if we needed anything, just terrible.  Similar experience about 2 wks later, came again at dinner time, server took our order but didn't bring sugar for our tea. I asked her about it, never came. Then our meals came, our drinks were empty, she asked if we needed anything and I told her, "Yah, sugar for our drinks, and DRINKS!" in a nice way.  It didn't faze her, she seemed oblivious.  Never checked on us to find out if we needed anything, or how the meal was. Sucky service every single time, no wonder they keep putting the Groupon deals out but alas even that will not bring us back. Stick to Arriba's for great service and excellent food.

Arriba's is great. They have definitely changed management at this location, because a few years back it was awful, but the last 1-2 years it has been awesome. We make the decision to sit in the bar area, as service is almost guaranteed to be excellent.  The bartenders they have are both friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. We never have to wait for a refill on either a mixed drink or a soft drink.  Their happy hour is great, 1/2 priced apps. that are so filling you won't need a main entree! If you opt for one, split it, as it will be more than enough. Food quality is very good, and we always enjoy our time there.   Keep it up!!

What a wonderful time Dolly Steamboat gives its passengers!  We had a wonderful time and saw bighorn sheep on yesterday's trip! Beautiful scenery, informative and interesting commentary from the captain, and just an overall awesome experience.  We ate at the restaurant afterwards and had great nachos and super service from the bartender. It was well worth the long drive and we will plan to be back! Thanks Dolly Steamboat!  Also--very affordable items in their 'gift shop', bought a cute wooden roadrunner! :)

The service was unfriendly and the owner acted like he was doing me a FAVOR by re-filling my tiny salsa cup "(I'll do it for you this time; next time there will be a charge.")  Wha???  Most places refill your chips/salsa until your heart's content.   The ambiance is artsy, which I like, but the seating is uncomfortable and stark.  The food was ok, but nothing special. I had a veggie burro and hubby had cheese enchiladas.  Those were both good, but not great. WAY too pricy for what you actually get, for sure.  Good Mexican?  Los Dos Molinos is a much better bet!

This restaurant REALLY varies by the location you choose; the Pima location was fantastic, but this location's service was deplorable.  We were seated right away, but after bringing our drinks, the server disappeared.  After 10 mins. we finally found a diff. server to ask if we could order our food. She was nice and said she'd find our waitress.  A couple mins. later she returned, didn't act like anything was odd about disappearing upstairs for so long, and took our lunch order.  It arrived, the food was really good, but she didn't return to ask us if we needed anything while we ate.  We needed tea refills but they came when the ice had almost completely melted already.  When we were finished she brought our bill but didn't clear our dirty plates! Mind you, we were the ONLY table in the entire restaurant since it was an 'off' time for lunch. She was more concerned about using the bottle of cleaner on the other tables and re-stocking silverware.  She rang up our total and brought our bill back. Still didn't clear the plates. Just a bad experience all around.  She was friendly enough, just not attentive whatsoever.  We walked out the door, no one said 'thanks' or 'see you next time,' nothing!  We are so disappointed because the other location was SO awesome! Guess we'll stick to that one, closer to home anyway.

We returned to this location and a great experience.  The service was much better, our server was diligent about making sure we had everything we needed. The food came out hot, well prepared. Our server checked on us throughout the meal and everything perfect. Thank you for encouraging us to give this location another try!

We love this place so much that we actually had them reserve the room upstairs of their North Scottsdale location to host our wedding shower in!!  Of course tons of southwest chicken rolls and hummus were served, along with the delicious beers they are so well-known for.  Being vegetarian, I appreciate that they have a nice selection of veggie stuff to choose from (cheese enchiladas, artichoke dip, blackbean burgers, nachos) and the service at the North Scottsdale one is just great.  We like the Tempe one, but usually find it a bit warm and a bit too far from us.  We always have super-fast service and perfectly prepared food, I just can't give this restaurant a better review!!

The service was excellent from the young man who brought our tea, salads, and lunch items.  No complaints there.  The tea was great, the salads, too.  However, the cucumber sandwiches were bitter, and so was the tunafish.  When we told the woman server of this, we were told "Well, sometimes you get a bitter cucumber."  When we asked her to substitute those with the ones we DID like (cranberry chicken salad or egg salad) we were told, "No, the chef already made all she's going to make for the day, and we won't make you more."  I about fell off my chair, so did my mom. For a 70th birthday present, I couldn't believe we had to endure 'no substitutions' for SOUR food.! What a joke. We will NOT be returning, and will take our business to better establishments for high tea, like the Ritz.  We also did not care for the fact that gratuity and tax were automatically added and would NOT have tipped that much on a $70 bill for such POOR customer service. I'm surprised this place still sticks around, what a disgrace.

FAR is an excellent place to shop for unique clothing, housewares, art, furniture; just about anything you may be looking for!  Most of the people working there are volunteers, so ALL of the money taken in by reselling gently used items goes right to the welfare and care of the dogs and cats they rescue.  It is a great organization with a very nice staff, and the store is maintained very well to make it easy to browse and save!

We absolutely love this restaurant!  We usually frequent it during happy hour or before a movie, and enjoy the nachos and/or quesadillas.  We ALWAYS have exceptional service, and most recently, Suzie has been our server in the bar area.  She's the most pleasant server we've had in a long time, and I felt she deserved to be mentioned here.    In addition to remembering what we drink each time, she's always quick to ask us if we'd like another before we have to ask her. Also, if we request a side of hot sauce or ranch or anything else, she or another staff member are always quick to bring it to us.  The other staff members are equally friendly and helpful, and the food is always fantastic. Being vegetarian, it isn't always easy to find quality meat-substitutes, especially in a sports bar and chicken restaurant, but BWW has a tasty selection served with a smile.  Thanks, BWW, for always assuring a great experience with a super staff and excellent food.  We'll be back!

We came here around 5 on a Sat. evening and it was already really busy! Surprising for such an early nite.  The ambiance was really cool, brick walls, old-time feel that we found refreshing among so many new and modern places everywhere else.   The server was very busy but attentive and helpful. We both ordered chicken dishes with the salad bar, which was well-stocked with a lot of options, all of which were fresh.  The prices were fair and the portions were reasonable.  I wouldn't say the food was anything extraordinary but it was tasty, hot, and filling.  We'll be back when we're in that area of town again, for sure! :)

We love this place! They are always busy, yet always get the order completely right. We have had the Thai chicken pizza, Gardein chick'n nuggets, & a multitude of different beers.   Service is always excellent, whether you were at a table or in the bar area, and the hostess station is always very well manned. Prices are a little high, but the quality of what you get is worth it. We will be back again and again.

We love Blue Agave, and have been coming for years.  The service is always very accommodating, friendly, and attentive.  We usually order the Chohulo (sp?) salad which isn't a typical taco salad, but a much different, "spunkier" type of meal! :) It's excellent.  We've also had the enchiladas and Owner's Burrito (I think it's called) and all are very, very tasty.    They attract a vast array of people from business lunch-goers, to sports fans, to kids and older adults alike. There's something for everyone on their menu and we continue to call it one of our favorite restaurants.

Zipps is awesome. We usually sit in the bar area and the servers are attentive, prompt, and courteous. We have never had a problem with the food, never gotten sick, and always enjoy our time there. I am shocked at the negative reviews, as we have been going to zip and Goldie's for 10 years. Never had an issue other than excellent service and food.

We love this place! First discovered through the use of Groupon almost a year ago, and have been back numerous times ever since.  Happy hour specials are great, the food takes a bit of time to arrive, but is always worth the wait. It's not a place you want to be rushed out of anyway, so waiting a bit on a nice patio with a beautiful view is not so bad...  The staff is nice, professional and friendly.  The only thing they could use are some misters on the patio, since it can be a little warm in the summer months up there.  Other than that, this place is perfect.  The art and the couches are great, we love it!

The pizza is excellent... The service is not. We were greeted right away, but drinks took literally 12 minutes before they arrived and we were the only table in the whole restaurant. When I did make eye contact with a waitress, she must have felt bad and realized she'd forgotten us, and said she had to go in the back to get some drinks. Then they came out right away. The pizza took as long as we expected it to, probably about 25 minutes, but once it did arrive she never checked to make sure we had everything we needed or that it was okay. At the end of the meal, I had to ask a different waitress for a box and our check.  Service aside, the food is excellent. The pizza is fresh, crispy crust was delicious, and next time we will know just to get a pizza to go rather than sit in the restaurant itself.

This place is awesome!  We got there when they first opened at 11, were greeted and served chips and salsa and water right away.  Sat outside in the bar area, server was friendly, attentive and prompt. Hubby and I both ordered lunch combos, they were hot, delicious and plentiful!!   We've been here a few times and it's always a great experience! :)

Temple is great because they have a huge patio that allows dogs! It also allows smokers which is a huge bummer. :( They should enforce a 50 feet away policy or something.  The food is really good and service is almost always excellent. They have great happy hour prices and a friendly staff. We always have a nice time there.

We had an excellent lunch here last Saturday. It wasn't busy which can sometimes mean poor service, but that was not the case here!!  We had baked ziti and a pizza salad combination. Both were excellent with plenty leftover. Our server was Excellent, refilled my water constantly and kept checking on my hubby's beer to see if he was OK.  Great food, cute and clean environment and superb service. Can't wait to go back!

What a great find!  First time here, had breakfast dishes, omelettes that were hot, filled with veggies and more than enough food (neither hubby nor I could finish our plates!) Our waiter was busy but extremely attentive, friendly and prompt.  Came around filling our drinks, asking if things were ok, and was genuinely nice and sociable.  These things seem like 'givens' when you dine out, but we find ALL TOO OFTEN that isn't the case!  Bathroom was clean, other staff members really friendly and when we left were told to 'have a great weekend, thank you!'   Little things to a LONG way with me, esp. after being in the restaurant biz for 5 years back in the day and knowing what it takes for one to be successful. We'll be back! :)

I like 18 Degrees a lot, and bonus that it's close to home.  The food is nothing spectacular, but they don't promise to be a gourmet eatery; they're a SPORTS BAR!  You're mostly going there for a drink, appetizer, and to watch the people skate, since you can't do that at very many other places across town.  The service is always above par and the food is pretty tasty.  We'll def. go back!

This place is a great find! Even though it's been around awhile, we finally got a chance to check it out for lunch and were so happy we did.  The ambiance is awesome; cute tables, couches, and hi-tops to accommodate any type of party.  There are HUGE original Ron Burns paintings of his famous colorful dogs which any dog enthusiast will appreciate, I loved them.  The server was friendly and attentive. I had a veggie salad that was crisp, tasty and satisfying; hubby had a turkey panini/wrap that was very good.  We will def. go back for a happy hr. and sample the wine and patio when it's cooler. Also looking forward to the bruschetta that looked delish.

We came in for lunch today; what a great place! Very cute ambience, clean and well lit.  Our server, Denise, was super outgoing, attentive and a genuinely warm person who really seemed to enjoy her job and people.  We had pizza and salad; the pizza was hot, the ingredients were fresh and plentiful, and Denise kept assuring our soft drinks were refilled. The salad was fresh, too.  We've lived here for years, but don't frequent this shopping center often so didn't think to try this location of Streets until now, but we'll definitely be back now that we've tried it! :)

What a great place! We have lived here for several years and Twisted Lizard is one of the best sports bars in the neighborhood! We sat at the bar and the service was impeccable. The food was very tasty and served with plenty of garnishment and condiments. The band was setting up and everybody seemed excited to hear them. It was great ambiance and we will definitely be back.

We had a Living Social deal that introduced us to Barney's.  What a fun place!  The Hawaiian BBQ chicken quesadilla was amazing, we would definitely go back for another!  Hubby had fish tacos that were pretty bland.  I had a chicken salad that was "eh."  The chicken itself was really good (blackened) but the lettuce/tomatoes were a little mushy.  I thought draft beer was a little pricy ($4.50) but the server/bartender was awesome!  She provided excellent service and was very attentive.  We'll def. be back for appetizers, and the fun patio atmosphere!

We've always loved the Tempe location, and this one is also a great addition.  Got the jerk tofu salad, hubby got the diablo bowl--both were as good as always. Would have liked more 'stuff'' in my salad (only has greens, carrot shavings and tortilla strips along w/the tofu) but it was my fault for not asking more to be added.  Service was awesome; one girl in particular was especially jovial, helpful, always smiling and very personable. Another at the counter looked like she just swallowed a lemon and acted irritated or just rude at the mere asking for a condiment.  Maybe she was having a bad day...  Overall we love Green and plan to come back when we're downtown again. The location is artsy and nice, limited parking is tricky but we made it work. ;)

We really like SMG.  We initially went with a Groupon, but have been back without one as well.  The service is great, the food is good (not great) and the seats are comfy.  They have fun events like Classic Movie Night on Thursdays for only $1 and half-priced draft beer.  Plus if you sign up for their newsletter they have deals like 2 new release movies (specific ones) for $10.    The one drawback is the overpriced drinks.  $9 for a shot of Jack Daniels is crazy, so I suggest going on deal nights and/or not consuming alcoholic drinks unless you have the money to burn.  Even a soda is $3.75 which is quite spendy for soda!

We love this place!  Holly, our server, is awesome; very attentive, positive, and gets our order right each time we're there!  We live a good 20 mins. from this restaurant but well worth the drive over!  The food is amazing, I get the blackened tilapia salad and it's delicious; hubby has gotten the enchiladas and chicken tacos, both dishes are very good.  The salsa isn't as spicy as the Camelback and the food is much more casual than the Palo Verde location, but just as yummy! We love all 3 locations and look forward to returning again! Thanks Fuego Tacos!

We really liked this place! It's decorated very cute, and although it's small, it's quaint and light, and the food was delicious.  I had the tostada salad, hubby had chile relleno, both were very fresh and tasty.  This is def. more of a To-Go place because seating is so limited, which is fine because the prices are great and the food is, too. We'll definitely be back!

We loved this place!  The ambiance is so different and COOL; musical instruments as light fixtures, cool Jazz album covers on the walls, and a great mix of alternative and contemporary music being played.  The draft beer selection is extensive, the service was impeccable, and the food was excellent.  Ordered the artichoke dip to start; hot and tasty.  Then the Veggie Madness medium pizza for dessert and it was amazing; so many veggies and even tofu for protein!  We had half of it leftover, that's how generous the toppings were.  The crust was great, too, Parmesan and olive oil drizzled on it which made it just awesome.  We'll be returning in the next couple of weeks, if not sooner!

This place needs some serious overhauling. The food, once you finally get it, is pretty good. But, the service is terrible. We were there at 1 o'clock on a Monday afternoon when a lunch crowd should have been underway. There are about 3 or 4 tables total in the whole place, and our server, while very friendly, was super slow. Hubby had an iced tea, needed to flag Jebidiah down for a refill. There is no reason food should have taken literally 28 minutes, I had a salad and my husband had a sandwich. Like I said, it tasted fine once it arrived but I think a cardboard box would have also tasted great as we waited so long for its arrival. No wonder this place keeps putting out Groupons, I think it's the only reason people actually frequent it. My initial visit to this place a year ago was great, however every time that we have been back since has been terrible.

My mom bought me a Deal Chicken for a gel mani and pedi for my birthday and I had a great experience here!  I'd never had gel before, was apprehensive about it because I'd heard bad things about the chemicals in it and inability to have it removed, but Kaitlynn pushed all fears out of my head. :)    She was a great nail tech, personable and knowledgeable (as I thinks someone else also noted) and I could tell she cared about her profession and her clients as well.  I didn't care for the colors that were available for the gel mani so she offered to use her OWN polish that I loved instead!  They turned out great, and I couldn't be happier.  My toes were also done very well, and the conversation and experience were all top notch.  I don't live close to this salon whatsoever but will definitely make the drive to see Kaitlynn again when my color needs changing. Thank you!!

A Groupon brought us in here but we would have come anyway as we missed the BWW that was here prior and were anxious for a good new sports bar to open in its place.  We had a great experience.   Hubby had the pastrami (loved it) and I had the BBQ chicken salad; both were excellent.  They were warm, fully-cooked, unlike some of the negative reviews on here about this restaurant.  We experienced only positives from dining here.  It was a Sunday lunch crowd, getting pretty busy, yet our service never suffered.  We sat in the bar area, so the bartender had both bar clients and high-tops and never missed a beat.  We will definitely be back!!

Zoolights has only gotten BETTER every year! We've been members for years and still enjoy going every year to see the lovely lights, displays, and hearing the music.  The zoo has no control of how many people show up on any given night, nor if couples make out during their visit, so these factors shouldn't even be considered in a review as some have noted!  As a wonderfully run not-for-profit zoo, they do a fantastic job at putting this on each year, as it takes MONTHS of preparation to get the displays ready for season. We noticed several new animal lights this year (namely tigers) and love that they keep improving. Keep it up, Phoenix Zoo!!

We came in on a Friday around noon, and were only 1 of 3 tables in the entire place.  The food was pretty good; I had a grilled chicken breast and a garden salad and sauteed veggies as sides.  Hubby had the Schnitzel which was tasty and huge.  4 stars for food, but service lacked.  It took a long time to get our food, and refills on tea/water.  Then we redeemed a deal we'd bought online and were told we had to "buy more" to use the entire amt. of the deal! We've never experienced that before, if anything it's a benefit to the restaurant who doesn't have to give us "more" since we were willing to forfeit it!  But she said that was the case, so we agreed to a piece of cake to go...the bill went from $27 to $36 (with tax).  The dry piece of thick-as-cement chocolate cake we brought home was inedible and NOWHERE worth the $7 or $8 price tag it came with!  We'd never go back. Too many good restaurants in S'dale to come here...and the bathroom was FILTHY.  Fluorescent light kept flickering in there so I was in the dark 1/2 the time and trash all over the floor. Gross.

We went here for a Kentucky Derby party and had a wonderful experience! The bartenders were attentive and made awesome drinks (mint julips and Jack/Coke).  We ordered a Margherita Pizza which came out quickly and was delicious. The owner gladly brought me an extra side of marinara (which the pizza didn't need, I just wanted more!!) that was larger than any side I could have ever expected; very much appreciated!! :)  The ambiance was very cool, each vase on each table had a unique live flower in it, and the chandeliers were very artsy and enjoyable to view.  We will def. be back for a more romantic dinner experience than just a casual lunch/horse-racing viewing.  It was great!

Wow, can't believe how many negative reviews are on here, especially after the awesome experience we had!  We have always loved Z's and this latest location is no exception!  They were packed for a Sat. early evening, and the servers were jumpin'. We were approached in the bar table immediately and our server was friendly, gracious, and prompt. Ordered a couple drinks, appetizers, all of which came out quickly and served hot.  I asked what certain apps. consisted of, and she explained in great detail how they were served.  She was spot on and the dishes were delicious.  Maybe they read the past reviews and stepped up the service and food, because we had the experience we always have at Z's; excellent and delicious...or maybe we just aren't as particular or have extreme expectations as some readers have...

As per our last visit, this place is still awesome! Came here on a Sun. around 4, it was happy hr. and they had a nice crowd going.  We sat at the bar, although the bartender was really busy, he got to us immediately and checked on us throughout our visit.  We shared the shrimp tostada bites and each had a drink, such a reasonable and tasty HH menu that doesn't break the bank! :)  We will be back when in Phx. again!

This place ROCKS!  Stopped in around 10:20AM and was happily surprised they were open so early, as I'd rather give a locally owned restaurant the business over a chain any day.    We ordered the grilled veggie pita and a small jalapeno hummus w/falafal and split both; EXCELLENT choices!  They were served very hot, the sauce on the pita was delish and the service was impeccable.  We have a PJ 5 mins. from the house, which is also awesome, but this place will def. be worth the extra drive for delicious food served quickly, hot, and with a smile.  We'll be back!!

This place stinks. The waitress acted like she had better things to do, blamed her bartender for her incompetence, and our drinks took forever. She thought that by apologizing that would somehow make it better? At least she acknowledged that it did take forever.   Compared to a jam-packed Sandbar just across the parking lot, this place was dead. There is no reason that anything should've taken more than 2 minutes to arrive at our table. The food was decent if you like Irish food, but it was a lot of carby, saturated fatty, overpriced junk. We will not be returning. And to echo another reviewer's comment, this place will probably will not be around long.   I hate to give bad reviews, but this place deserves one. I'm more than generous when it comes to the great places that we often frequent.

This PJ's food is as good as any of the others, which is excellent.  We ordered the hummus trio for starters, and a chicken philly and Greek gyro for the main entrees. Both were hot, delicious, and we wanted for nothing insofar as the food goes.  A couple things that seem to be a recurring theme in this area is the lack of enthusiasm in the staff.  Maybe it's the local youth who work in restaurants around MMR, but there is a general malaise about them that you don't find in other parts of town.  Another thing many restaurants do that I find annoying is seat you RIGHT on top of another table even though there are many others available!  I know this helps the server maintain his/her section, but it's annoying to overhear the next table's conversations when I don't NEED to!  Please take note of this, PJ. : )  Other than that, this place is awesome and we look forward to riding our bikes down here to HH.

Love it already!  Had to go on the grand opening as we'd been anxious for this BW's to open since we first saw the sign that it was coming!  They were BUSY at 11AM and they didn't miss a single beat!  Servers were friendly, smiling, attentive, and seemed genuinely excited to be there! The vibe is awesome there, the layout with the TV's and decorations were excellent. Every other restaurant in this building has closed within the first couple of years, however I'm betting with this Buffalo being here, they're in for the long haul! Keep up the excellent work, we look forward to coming back! :)

We had damage from a local car wash and they asked us to bring it here for an estimate. Very professional environment and overall experience. Our car came back in the 2 day time frame as promised and they did an absolutely wonderful job on the bumper repair. Will be back in the future if needed. Thank you for such a great experience!

Came around 9 on a weekday, we were the only ones there so we were a bit worried, but the food didn't let us down!  Service was fast, we had lunch items that were fantastic.  Great portions and served hot and delicious.

Such a classy place now that Nori moved in! Sat on the patio, just wanted a quick happy hour beer and roll. We had sweet & chili tofu which was unique and delish! Also Las Vegas roll which was great, too. The plants and waterfall are relaxing and the menus on wooden boards were really awesome! I do not remember our waitress's name, however she was exceptional and checked on us several times. We will definitely be back.

Yum!!! Been meaning to check this place out for months, so glad I finally did!! Excellent server, friendly and knowledge about menu and questions we had. I had the vegan burger, delicious homemade patty and very generous size. My friend had chicken tenders which she said were great.  Nice patio which we're excited to bring our dog to soon!

This location has been many things, and this one seems like it won't be around long, either.  The roasted cauliflower was ok, not hot, and the flavor was decent. We had the Messina pizza, asked for artichokes to be added--they weren't.  Pizza had very little sauce or cheese, and was more like an appetizer with its thin crust and lack of toppings.  No way could a normal sized person make 'dinner' out of this!  We wish this location could land a winner because it's close to home and has great potential, but alas, this won't be it.

At the owner's request, we gave LP another shot and were very pleased we did.  We had two pizzas, the Michelangelo and Messina, both were hot, heavy with cheese and the perfect amount of sauce. We got them to go so I can't comment on the service, but the quality of the food was great and the server handling our order was very friendly and professional.

Breakfast was really good. Had the one egg with hashbrowns and wheat toast. Hubby had biscuits and gravy and said they were awesome. Service lacked but food made up for it.

This restaurant is awesome. We've only been twice but both times the pizza was delicious, filling and very reasonably priced.  The service was ABOVE excellent and we are happy  to make the 25 mile commute from Scottsdale for such great service.   We will continue to frequent here as often as possible! Thanks for such a great experience!
