This place is ridiculous!!!!! I have been working on vehicles for 15 years but I can't do it all with my busy schedule. I had my wife bring in her car to have an alignment done and these guys estimated an additional $2200 worth of work that needs to be done. B.S. I then sent her back in there to get her car and the guy at the front counter said the estimate is $45 which I had no problem paying. Then he asked her to go get cash for the estimate?? (Fishy) So I decided to call and ask how much an inspection costs and the district manager was randomly there and said that inspections are free!!! They see a pretty girl come in and take full advantage!!! If you plan on using this scammer company make sure you have a knowledgable person with you. I will never use this place again and am getting another estimate somewhere else. I will make an update review when I hear back from the next place but for the time being I will make a formal complaint to the BBB!

Best sushi I have had in AZ, the presentation was spectacular and the food was awesome! We had the Phoenix roll, crazy salmon roll and the golden dragon roll and they were all amazing.I will be going back for sure.

I have been meaning to write this for a while. The guys at CCC are great. I called for an estimate for my 4 door wrangler. It was a very tall order that included, head unit, full speaker replacement with beefy sub, remote start etc.... They were about $1000 cheaper and were very open to my requests. This having being one of the first JK's with these suggestions we tried a few different options for the sub. After them swapping out 2 other subs they installed the best sounding full system I have heard in a JK unlimited. Sounds ridiculous and as with any system there are some fine tuning that needs to be done occasionally and they are always happy to do so!!  I also asked for an additional speaker for my cb which they found one sitting around and installed for no charge. Use these guys, you won't regret it!!!!!
