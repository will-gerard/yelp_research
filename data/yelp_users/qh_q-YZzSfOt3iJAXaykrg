Upon entering the place has a cozy home feel to it. May be a little too cozy for some as the tables are fairly close to each other. The menu isn't very extensive, lots of pasta, some calamari, chicken and veal.    My boyfriend and I were seated and had napkins laid on our laps. We were left there , forgotten for about 15 min, while other tables around us were being attended to.  The whole meal went that way, it was not a very pleasant experience and we will not be returning.  Other patrons were offered choices with their entrees, we were not, others were offered sambuca after the meal, we were not.    I don't want to say that our experience was racial, but it felt that way as I was the only non-white customer in the establishment that night.

Great happy hour prices. Fast service and friendly staff. Cheater chopsticks available for the chopstick inclined.  I really enjoyed the raw salmon and tuna. The rolls are also very tasty, but I prefer to gorge on the raw fish. It was Delicious.

My daughter and I and arrived at 4 pm (our appointment time) and sat there for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged. Walked out and went to Autumn Lee nails instead.  The only good thing I can say about the place was that it looked clean.

My Fiancee and I visited this new establishment after watching a movie at AMC.  We are so glad we did! The decor is very modern and clean, and the food is delish! We got lunch specials and left feeling very satisfied. The food was fresh and very flavorful. We will definitely be back again! ALSO, everyone was SUPER friendly and NICE! It was awesome =)

This is our second time here.  This place was just as good as the last time we were here.  It started with our waiter Rishad.  He was nice and very quick.  He made sure we left the restaurant satisfied.  Even his manager came by to see if we were enjoying the experience.  The meal started with their Q-Rolls.  Seasoned beef brisket with a BBQ dipping sauce and a chipotle dip.  They are always great.  Aggie ordered Smoasted chicken (smoked. & roasted) with BBQ.  Her sides were Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes.  She enjoyed it very much.  I ordered Beef brisket with Ranch Beans and mashed potatoes.  It was very, very good.  I enjoyed every bit.    Mikaela ordered the Kid's Cheeseburger with fries.  I took a bit of her cheeseburger, and the beef tasted better than anything from other burger places.  I couldn't believe it.    To drink, Mikaela ordered their sweet tea (best I have tasted from any restaurant), and Aggie and I ordered Frosted Lemonades.  They were tart and sweet, and sugar coated the glass.  That was a nice touch.  We will definitely come back here.  It is just epic!

Beautiful little garden. Buy the Koi food at the gift shop,  it is very funny to see all the fish swarm with the mouths wide open. Very peaceful and relaxing. You can take personal photographs.   Will definitely return, especially to feed the Koi. =)

Beautiful dolphin exhibit. The closest I have ever been to a dolphin as well.  Not too much to walk around and see, but what they do have is beautiful and well kept and the animals seems well taken care of. Your photo is taken before entering the lion habitat and you can view it and decide to purchase in the gift shop before you leave. Very nice experience for the family, though a little on the steep side price wise, it is a great stop if you have little ones or if you love dolphins, lions and tigers =) Entrance was about $55 for 2 adults and 1 child, full price as we did not have any coupons. We purchased a photo package of 4 shots and it came with paper frames and 1 nice frame surrounded with lions and tigers for about $38.

Went during lunch time. Wait was long to pay, and then another long wait to be seated. Food was average, there are better buffets to choose from if you are willing to pay a couple of extra bucks.  For the price, you get what you pay for.  Waitress was friendly.

"How much did you spend?"  "Twenty-something."  "We should have went to Chipotle."  If that exchange does not give any indication of our view, I will just type it out.  They are good, but they are a bit overpriced, and their food lacked that punch.  It does not help there are better restaurants in the vicinity.    The stew tasted like baked beans, the smothered BBQ chicken sandwich was bland, the Shaniac was okay, but it was very messy, and the sweeten tea was almost like straight sugar. So, that requires unsweetened to dilute it.    The better options in the area will not allow me to make a repeat visit.  I am not heart broken by it.  ~David

I was referred to this office by my dentist for a root canal.  I have had a root canal in the past, but my experience this time around was great :) everyone is friendly and the office is welcoming and clean.  I had my root canal scheduled and taken care of quickly. I am writing this a day after my dental work and the terrible pain I used to feel when drinking cold liquids is finally gone :) the procedure took less than 30 minutes and virtually painless from start to finish.   - Aggie

Very friendly and courteous staff. My daughter and I arrived around 4:25 on Sunday (they close at 4). As they still had customers inside they greeted us as if they had just opened. The wait was not long before they did mine and my daughter's nails. The technician who did our nails took her time and did an amazing job on our gel manicures. Amazing service all around. So glad to have found this gem so close to home. Will definitely be back =)

Dr. Carson has been treating my family and I for years. The treatment that I received for my cavities was a cut above the rest.  I am glad I have a great dentist in my area, and I recommend him to anyone looking for a good dentist.  ~David

Was referred to this location by my favorite chiropractor (Dr. Miller - Miller Chiropractic) to get some pain meds when my back got out of whack! The place is nice, comfy chairs to sit in, your typical wait area. I am pretty sure my wait time may have seemed longer than it actually was, but I was in paid and when you are in pain waiting is agonizing.  When I thought I was going in to finally be seen, it was only to take my temp and blood pressure, get asked a few questions and then got sent back out into the lobby to wait once again to be called in. Everyone was super nice though. I was asked if I needed anything, a wheel chair, ice pack. I denied the wheel chair because although it was very difficult at the time to walk, I still wanted to feel some what in control of what was going on to me =P I gladly accepted the ice pack though. Doctor was very helpful and informative. They have a pharmacy onsite that will prescribe you all the meds you need at $15 a pop. Good for those that do not have insurance, but if you do have insurance it is probably best to ask them to write you out a script to get filled elsewhere for a bit less. Overall a good experience =)

Went here for a late night breakfast when a pancake craving hit. Was decent. I stuck with the original pancake syrup. They have flavored options such as strawberry, blueberry and butter pecan, but they tasted like medicine to me. I was allowed to order from the kids menu, so that was a plus as i was not feeling like having a huge stack of pancakes.  Waitress was friendly and attentive, kept the water and coffee coming. Interior was clean and quiet.

My go to AMC for matinee movies. $5 movies and close to home, gotta love it. Seats are comfy and theaters are clean.   Perks if you are a stubs card member, small discounts on food and drinks.

Okay, this is an awesome place.  I recommend getting the "All You Can Eat" fondue special.  You get one appetizer (a cheese fondue), a salad (either house or caesar), main course with vegatables (put those in the pot right away), multiple meats that you can refill until you had your fill, and then a dessert fondue.  Because fondue is more methodical than just stuffing your face at a buffet, you will eat a lot less.  But, the food is soooooooooo good.  The quality of the meats are excellent, and I do not feel like I am overcharged at all.    Quality costs money!

I went to Strut during their 1 day a year sale and I couldn't have been any happier. I was greeted by Ann who asked me a few questions on my style and the look I was going for. Luckily my Maid of Honor was with me because I have NO CLUE when it comes to clothes terminology. Haha. I'm a goodwill kind of girl, jeans and tees.  Ann made me feel very comfortable and I did not feel judged. Being a bigger girl I am always self conscious about my body, but Ann made me feel so relaxed I had no problem undressing to my undergarments so that she could assist me with putting on the dresses she picked out for me. The very first dress she put on me was PERFECT!  I could not believe it and I felt like a princess :) I can not wait for my wedding day and to see the look on my Fiancees face. Haha. Thank you Ann! My experience was amazing.

Aggie and I wanted to try some French cuisine, and this place came up in our search.  This is a well hidden gem behind Starbucks and Jamba Juice.    We ordered escargot (us), frog legs(me), Beef Bourguignon (her), Tarte Flambee, and french onion soup.   The escargot was great.  It was very tasty, and the subtle spices made it one of my favorite appetizers.  They come in a ceramic dish that holds a single escargot in a dimple.  5 dimples = 5 cooked snails.  The French onion soup had a thick layer of cheese.  That was very good, and it was oh so tasty.  I would highly recommend it.  The frog legs was seasoned with olive oil and thyme.  They were very succulent and tasty.  I will definitely have them again.  The Tarte Flambee was ginormous but very tasty.  Its size is about the size of a large pizza.    The Beef Bourguignon was succulent and it came with four carrots and some quinoa (seasoned with olive oil and thyme).  Twas a great dish.  She finished every bit.   It was a great experience, and it is nice to have an authentic French restaurant in the Scottsdale area.

I love coming here to wash my car. I have the cheapest plan, $16 per month for unlimited monthly washes (2x per day) this includes your basic wash and free vacuums. I started out with the highest plan $22 per month which included air fresheners and little wipes to wipe down the interior of your car as you rolled through the 3 minute wash. But, I felt it was a bit much for myself as I carry my own wipes and have my own air fresheners as well. With the and, they stick a small bar code on the inside of your windshield so that you just pull up and the machine will scan it and you roll on through. It is pretty awesome. They do have a restroom inside as well as additional you can purchase to clean your car. Oh, almost forgot to mention the bug prep station. A long handled brush to scrub away all those bugs you picked up on long trips before heading into the wash.  Definitely worth a try. I personally love it :)

The best breakfast I have had in Phoenix. Hands down. All natural, real butter, Maple syrup!  The pancakes were soooo delicious. They come out buttered with a little jar of maple syrup to pour over them. I thought the syrup was not going to be enough to satisfy my need of having to eat pancakes smothered in syrup, but TRUST when I say these pancakes were so good that they did not need to be smothered. Also had an omelette with bacon, sausage and peppers with a side of home fries. Yes, it was as delicious as it sounds. I love food and Matt's did not disappoint. Portions were large, expect to take home leftovers unless you arrive with a hungry man appetite :) the only bad thing I can comment on is the wait. If you do not show up bright and early, expect to wait at least 30 minutes. But once you are in you will realize the food was worth the wait :)

It was empty when we arrived, but I am glad we did not let that decide on whether that meant the food or service was lacking.  Clean restaurant and restroom, Friendly and delicious food is what we received. Free miso soup, and delicious rolls which were on the happy hour menu (ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR!!) My daughter and BF loved it, as did I. Will definitely return =)

They are a great place on GCC's campus to get a nice smoothie, snack, or any assortment of coffee beverage.  I really enjoy their chai tea (hot-best, iced-great).  It is also a family owned business.

Love Chipotle and super stoked this one has opened near the house! As it is new, the store is very clean. Staff is super friendly and the food tastes the same as any other Chipotle, Delicious!  I have to go to another location  to be certain, but either prices went up or this location  is a tad bit pricier. I only say this because I am used to hearing "that'll  be 1.80 extra for guac" but here it was 1.95.   Not a deal breaker for this chick. Lay it on me! Om nom nom.

We saw TJ Miller for their opening night.  I give it 4 stars for two reasons, the place was a bit on the warm side (I was not drinking either) and the host was not very funny or relating much with the audience.    Aside from that, the place is great. We didn't order any food, but they have many food and beverage options and NO TWO ITEM LIMIT! My husband ordered two Coronas at $9 a pop. Seemed a bit steep to me, but hey, it's part of the fun of going out, spending money. =P   The seating was fantastic. I have been to comedy clubs who pack people in like sardines and I did not get that here. Big plus!  Parking is ample in the parking garage and it is situated in a shopping center. I also saw signs of a Toby Keith restaurant opening up soon practically next door.   The employees we interacted with were very friendly. Would definitely go back for more shows =) Would only hope they crank up the AC so I wouldn't have to use thier menu as a fan =P
