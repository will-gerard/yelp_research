After a lot of begging and convincing, me and my boyfriend decided to get pedicures together. I searched for places close to home and after reviewing Fancy Nails decided to give it a shot. We got there and all the techs and who seemed to be the owner or manager made us feel very welcomed. The place was clean and inviting. We got to the chairs which were probably the nicest chairs I've seen in a while and I loved that the spa pedi bowls had one use plastic liners that are disposed of after every single use. My massage was AMAZING!!! and the polish and selection was good!!! I was very happy and even my boyfriend said when we were finished "that was awesome, we need to do that a lot more" SCORE ;)

So i'm going to start out by saying I know we are in a recession and money is tight but this was the worst mini golf course that I have ever seen. I loved that when we walked in all the arcade games were shut off and didn't work....probably because our round of mini golf only costed $12 for the 2 of us. We proceeded to the course which was a total joke. The turf was totally beat up, the staging and props looked condemned, and at one point I smelt something that resembled a dead body or animal. At one point I bet this was a nice place but the ponds that went thru the course were all dried up and not working and everything was a mess! It wasn't enjoyable and we were very disappointed, Spend the extra couple dollars and go to crackerjax or castle n coasters.

Me and my Hubby bought both sets of rings from Shane Co. We loved every aspect. From the shopping experiences, down to the sneaky purchasing that we both had to finagle around the other lol. He ended up sneaking my ring while we were there looking, I went to the bathroom and bam it was figured out so that was so neat and I had not the slightest clue! Brian went back and got a beautiful band to match my ring and had it engraved "better together". I went back and got Brian's band there another occasion and had a great buying experience! I also had something engraved on Brian's ring, my fingerprint. They took my print there and engraved it on the inside of his ring. Neither of us knew the other was engraving so the day of this was such a cool surprise. Very reasonable. Best warranty. Best customer service. Best quality jewelry. So happy! Thank you Shane Co.

This is by far the poorest excuse for sushi! We happened to be on this side of town and by the other reviews and it being rated 4 stars we thought it was a safe choice.....I was wrong!!! I eat sushi because I like raw FRESH fish. I do not like rolls with deep fried fish, with imitation or fake substitute ingredients, and garnished with 2 oz of spicy mayo. They do not have more than 3 or 4 rolls that don't have some sort of tempura, deep fried, or "krab" mix. So the food alone will be reason enough for me to never go back. The service mirrored the food. We had to ask for everything (ex. Ginger, wasabi, soy sauce, refills, check) It got to the point where we felt like we couldn't bother or ask them for anything else. For the price we were charged I could have had sushi at a 5 star restaurant. Being an ex bartender/server I couldn't not tip, but was very hard to tip. DO NOT GO HERE!

I would say this is one of the best Vegetarian/Vegan restaurants I have been to in a while! Their mock meats are seasoned so well and the food is really healthy you feel good leaving there! Appetizer: Chili Fries...Yum! Entree: Kung Pao Chicken...Yummier! Dessert: Tsoynami with bananas, peanut butter, mallow...Yummiest!!!!! So good you must go!

Talk about a secret local gem! This place has so much to offer. The food, being the most important is always delicious. Yes! Always, meaning we've gone more than once. It's authentic Italian food! The servings are on the larger side so this makes the family sharing and trying is a fun touch! They even have gluten free options. When Arizona has nice weather the patio is so charming, cute little courtyard, fire pit. The servers are always sweet and great service. If you are looking for a place this is it! Soooooo yummy

I eat a Gluten free diet and I love Scramble's Gluten free crust for the Brizza (breakfast pizza). The food is Always good. It's nice that you order and then sit so it moves pretty quick. Everything on the menu is delish. They also have a great patio that is also dog friendly

So when i moved back from Portland, Oregon I realized that AZ is the poster child for the Corporate world. I had a hard time finding restaurants that were small and intimate with unique and great food. I heard of 25 degrees and gave it a try.....The food was KILLER! this is the best "burger joint" ever! Also, they have great drinks, a big wine selection, and beers that expand beyond Bud Light. I am a pescatarian which means im a vegetarian that eats seafood so also finding places that fit my diet is hard sometimes. I got the yellowfin ahi tuna burger and im telling you, OUT OF THIS WORLD! cooked to perfection and served with the sweet potatoe fries you just can't go wrong. My boyfriend got a "real" hamburger and said it was one of the best burgers he's had. Now as if that wasn't enough we decided to splurge and check out the sweets, we went with banana fosters, dark rum milkshake...enough said! Get over to 25 degrees so you can taste what we did! AMAZING!!!!

So this is a little secret i'm gonna blow! Toast was soooo amazing! located on 7th st just past Thomas, on East side of street. The food was out of this world. I had an delicious smoked salmon sandwich on ciabatta, and my friend had an egg and veggie sandwich with cheese.  The coffee is great served in Big mugs, and the staff is so enjoyable! I recommend this restaurant to everyone, meat lovers or vegetarians, all will like! Yummy!!!!! You must go! DO IT!

I love this place! Aesthetically pleasing. Very clean. My Gel nails look great and the girl who did them (Kelsey) was very sweet and thorough. She talked me into something fun! I loved everything about this place other than one thing...it's really really crazy busy packed with people. But that is the only thing that was slightly overwhelming. Other than that this place would have rated 5 stars!

Well I'm reviewing this place and I have not even had the opportunity to work out there. I called to get some info on pricing and classes. I HATE GYMS for a couple reasons. 1. I don't use work out equipment I join only for the classes 2. I don't like the pressure you get to buy a better package or a trainer. I don't want any of that. 3. Some gyms are clean and some are not. I called because this location was close to my house. The guy on the phone was rude. I asked at least 5 different times and he literally would not give me any pricing over the phone. Not a range or anything. We started going back and forth telling me I need to come in and speak with him. Finally, after asking to speak with a manager and him telling me he was at lunch....I told him that the impression I've got over the phone was no good and I didn't know if I wanted to come in now...he said oh ok well I can tell you our packages start around $19.99 a month. How hard was that?! He didn't say bye he literally hung up. Wow exceptional customer service, makes me really want to come frequent your gym... NOT!!!!!

If you want a super fun way to get your guests involved this is the way to do it! The photo booths as a hit at our wedding thanks to Erica and Amy! They were so professional but really fun and made sure to grab me and my groom to remind us we needed to get in there too which I appreciated!!! They managed our guest book w the ex photos the booth prints out so no we have this awesome guest book w pics. I can't rave enough about the booth and girls! It was perfect!

Gluten free vegetarian options and their truffle fries and queso are seriously the most amazing. You HAVE TO TRY THE FRIES!
