Harlow's is hands down my favorite breakfast joint in Tempe. Their portions are generous and always delicious. Definitely order a side of their biscuits if it doesn't come with your meal. They are Baked fresh and come out still steaming. Can't beat em!

Food was good but the service was the worst ive ever had. To top it all off, my server charged my card a different amount than was on the receipt. $17 more to be exact! Will never go back.

I work at centurion restaurant in downtown Phoenix and had one of the servers from here come into my work. She was delightful and recommended I come try it out- what a recommendation it was! My girlfriend and I came here on a Monday evening during happy hour (which is 7 days a week) and sampled the entire tapas happy hour menu and had our fill of the red sangria as well. All of it was phenomenal! Once happy hour ended we were still hungry and decided to share the arr√µs negre paella. This dish was truly authentic Spanish cuisine; calamari and prawns with blacks beans, rice, peas and doused black with squid ink. it looks intimidating but if you can get past the rich black color, the flavor is remarkable. Absolutely delish. We also both enjoyed a glass of wine recommended by our server Laura, who is from chihuahua, Mexico and has an accent that is as enticing as the food. She was very knowledgeable and provided wonderful service. It was obvious she was passionate about her work and providing a memorable experience. This is definitely my new favorite restaurant and will be back time and time again. My only issue is that I can't tell more people about it fast enough. Can't wait for my next visit!!

This a a new trendy place in the mill ave district. Breakfast here is delicious, although the portions are on the smaller side so if you're starving it might not be the best choice.   Tip: best bloody Mary I've ever had.
