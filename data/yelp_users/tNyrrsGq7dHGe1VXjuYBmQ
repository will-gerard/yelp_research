Very clean. Staff is very nice and helpful. The food is great. Never had a bad meal. I am a regular at this place. Chorizo burrito for breakfast and carne asada burrito for dinner!

McDonalds is bad as it is and this is the worst. The food is always dry and tastes horrible. Go to Wendy's or Whataburger, or at least find a different McDonald's location.

Food is pretty good. The wait usually sucks and the parking is always horrible.  Last time I was here, they messed up my order bad and I didn't realize until I had driven off. Keep your receipt in case they mess it up!

Music is good. Fun place to go. Service is okay but the waitresses have too many customer to handle at once. The cover charge is a little too much. The bartenders are horrible. Ever watch Bar Rescue and see what horrible bartenders do? They pretty much do the same thing. For instance, when they use the cocktail shaker they flip the glass around and use it to drain. The glass has their dirty hands all over it and now all of that is in your drink. Nasty. Drink bottled beer cause you know it's not tainted...

YardHouse is the one positive about west gate. Food is pretty good. Great selection of drinks and beer. Staff is always very nice. Call me a regular here. There are better restaurants and there are better bars but this is a good mixture and is close to home.

Real classy place let me tell you. Tables are filthy. Paper towels all over the ground. A hand written paper says "this area is for bottle service only" and of course no one is in there. Cover charge at this place?? You know they are dying. Jon Taffer needs to come in and over haul this place if they ever want customers again. It's very ghetto so stay away if you are looking for safety!

Love their tacos. It usually takes a little while to get your food but that's how you know it's made to order.

Food is decent. I had the short ribs and they were dry and over cooked. We also had the Mac and cheese and it was cold. Way too over priced for what you get, especially since the portion sizes are small.

I consider myself a regular here. The donuts are great. The coffee is great. Their blended ice coffee is much larger, tastier and cheaper than starbucks and they have more flavors. The workers are VERY nice. I highly recommend Daily Donuts. And no I am not in any way affiliated with the owners.
