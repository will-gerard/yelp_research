Well, if I want to be a Yelper I need to post unsatisfied reviews as well as the good.   I took my car in June 2016. I called at 8:30am on a Friday and told the man the a/c wasn't cooling as it should. The man who answered told me to bring it in. I got the car there at 9am. The man told me they would call with an estimate. I didn't get a call so I called at 12:30pm and was told they were busy and hadn't gotten to it and they would call me. I didn't get a call so I called at 3pm and was told they were just getting to it. By 5pm I had places to go so I gave up. They called me at 5:30pm to give me the estimate. By this time I had no more trust in them. I went the next morning and picked up my car to take somewhere else.  I think, if they were busy, they should not have told me to come in and instead made an appointment for me to go in the next day. Waiting all day, just for an estimate, is not good business.

Lamar's Donuts has the tastiest donuts I've ever had!! The store is very clean and they have a large donut selection. They have lots of coffee selections as well.  This donut shop is a must try. You won't be disappointed!!

If you're looking for a diner, that isn't a chain, this is the place to go. The servers are friendly and the food is fantastic!!  It's always busy on Sundays but we seem to be able to get a table right away. This is important because we bring my 99 year old Grandma who doesn't want to wait.

I had a sample of the Mocha Almond Fudge and it's a winner!! It has the bitterness that I look for in chocolate.   My daughter had the Fat Elvis flavor. There is real peanut butter and bananas in it!  My Grandma had the Oatmeal Cream Pie flavor. There is real oatmeal cookie in it!  The service is fantastic here! Also, free Wi-Fi.  Very unique flavors!!  I highly recommend this place!!

I really like the idea of Muscle Maker Grill. They advertise healthy food. They have pastas, wraps, salads and entr√©es. They have choices of chicken, shrimp and beef  Each item on the menu has the calories listed, which I appreciate. I only gave 4 stars because I'd love for them to really embrace the healthy food. I had the Arizona. It has brown rice, but a healthier choice would be quinoa. It's not available. The Arizona I was served looked exactly like the photo which is always a plus! They also serve fruit & veggie smoothies, shakes and coffee drinks.  I will definitely go again.

I got the hook up at Jackson's. Getting the car washed, scrubbed, steamed and waxed. Also, they told me about a new special they have of $30 unlimited basic wash, vacuum and dry. Sounds great!  I picked up my car 4 hours later and it is Sparkling!! I'm very happy with the service and work done for me. I will be going back.

Oriental House is great! As you walk in there is hand wash to cleanse your hands. I like this idea!! We were greeted and seated very quickly. It's a lovely place; very pretty. The wait staff is very friendly. Most of the lunch specials are in the $6 to $7 range; lots to choose from. I got the Sesame Chicken with Fried Rice. Yummy!
