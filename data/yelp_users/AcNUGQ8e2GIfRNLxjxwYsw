So I checked around yelp for a new place to try for tacos and i came across Tacos De Jaurez. I was downtown so I decided to check it out with my sister.... I ordered the #5 carne asada soft tacos off the lunch menu and a large horchata ($5.99 and $1.99) and my sister order just one chicken soft taco............probably because I brought her to a place she's never been before, plus there were a few guys outside working on a vehicle and it sat in an open lot between two odd buildings... haha. So we got our food within 8 mins, not bad at all... she opened her bag and took one bite then scarffed the rest. I gave her a look as I was opening my food, as if to say your not touching mine because I had enough faith to order alot and i'm going to eat it all look.... It came with very delicious pico de gallo and red and green salsa. All three combined in my taco was awesome:).... full of flavor! The tacos came with rice and beans, both cooked perfectly... We didnt dine-in so i can't comment much about the service, but cashier lady was helpful and nice.   So yeah I enjoyed it very much, although I didnt get to finish it all myself because I decided to share with my sister...yeah I know..snooze you loose, but I did.  I can tell she enjoyed the unexpected stop at Taco De Juarez, so we will be back:)

Okay I know this is a chain, but I had to review because I was expecting average service and food. First off superb service from the hostess to the waiter to servers to table clean up crew. Now onto food, I usually stay away from places like this because they seem to offer the same bland overcooked food (i.e. Macayos, Manuels, Pancho's), but everyone in our group enjoyed their meal. We will most likely visit whenever we're in this part of town again.

This place is a must find and try! Its kinda a hole in the wall place that will make you question its' goodness, but get out of your car and order something! (before the line triples in length) I came here with a large party, so we did find it kind of hard to sit together, but still we enjoyed our meal. I tried the tacos and tamales, both delicious and leaves me wanting to try more.

OK i had to write a review because I was very disappointed!  I gave this place the benfit of the doubt only because i heard they had a great happy hour and it is a brewery! Plus they only had 3 stars when i looked over the yelp reviews, I wanted to help improve that......Big mistake .....I should've listened to my fellow yelpers. I decided to have my birthday dinner here on a friday, we decided we would meet early for happy hour then move to dining area for dinner. Well my small party of 4 got there around 6:15pm, we thought it was just in time to put in a quick order for cheap food and drinks, but it took forever to find an available server, one guy stopped by and said he'll be "back in a sec" but never did. So we decided to move to the patio where we thought it would be easier to put in our order, the lady taking orders was nice enough to put our order in 2 minutes before it ended. We were rushed and didnt even have the HR menus to look over because they guy never gave us them and there weren't any on the patio table. She was also pretty slow at getting them, i'm sure we would've had 4 minutes to order if she knew the urgency of HR ending at 6:30pm!!  Come on now.....There were alot of older people and it got pretty dead after HR ended..  After that we moved to the dining area where other members of our party met us. The menu looked good from the pictures and description they gave....but the beer selection was very limited. :( White ale, red ale, dark ale??? ok.. at least put some personality into naming them and make sure your server is educated on each beer.  Over all the food sucked and beer sucked. No taste in either one.. It was a sad birthday dinner, yes i ate all my food because i was starving! I didnt get sick so that's good.... We had one beer/drink each and regreted the beer choice after the first sip, we left right away to get a real drink. Oh I did have a choice of either a free cake or drink for my Bday, I chose the carrot cake.. it was good, not the best. She just sat it down on the table said happy birthday then walked off......uh thanks yay happy birthday to me... oh and she charged us for the cake.. but corrected it after we mentioned it.   I know better now to stick with the good ol' Four Peaks Brewery for GREAT Food and Beer!  They have an extensive selection of beer to choose from, even if it isn't made in their brewery!  Servers/ hostess were nice, except for mr. invisable...   Just dont go....maybe for HR but you wont taste much:(  *Excuse my spelling and sentences, just so much happened and I can't think right trying to get it all out!

Good place to practice, but sometimes it can get a little crowded.. A plus is that on Friday ladies are free, but have to pay for target and rounds..

This recent visit (9/13/2014) was because I received a BOGO coupon through my email and thought it was a great deal. I visited this location awhile back when I lived nearby and thought might as well go again since I remember it being good.. wrong.  Sad to say it wasn't the same, it was far from it. First off at 8:30am on a Saturday morning it was rather empty, that should have been our first clue. Second, the hostess (older lady with glasses) was rather indifferent about us being there. She looked me up and down, then said " just two?", without so much as a Hi or welcome attached. That was the only glance we got our way while she wiped stains off the menus and made smacking sounds with her gum..oh and can't forget the awkward silence before she finally said to follow her. After she sat us down, my boyfriend commented to me about her not even looking as us. He was rather annoyed at the unfriendly greeting and it kind of ruined the start of our breakfast on a beautiful Saturday morning.   Thankfully, what changed the mood for the better was our server, she was what you'd expect a hostess to be. She was friendly, conversational and made us finally feel welcome. For awhile she made us forget about the rude person in the front.   So onto our food experience: Our food was alright, not amazing.. I'm not sure what changed with this place, but something is different. No complaints about the food, it was average and came out like we ordered. I've definitely had more memorable food.. hehe i'm a breakfast lover..  When we finished, we felt satisfied and happy with the service from our server.... but as we were leaving we passed the hostess again... and well she was filing her nails by the hostess stand near the menus and only looked up to say "thanks for coming" then looked back down without even stopping what she was doing.. That is grooosssss, but at least she looked at us this time..  I really hope the managers actually read these reviews, because if they cared about customer service and hospitality they would make changes. This experience makes me not want to come back, the BOGO was not worth it. Can you imagine how far her fingernail shavings flew around inside?  By the way... I recommend Sunny's Diner in Tempe. 10x better than this place and half the price.

Pizza by the slice.. crust is crunchy and just right:)   We had a chance encounter with this place, by just driving by and decided to give it a whirl. Its a nice tiny eatery on the corner and it must be legit, because almost all the people ordering take-out and dining in were Italian.. We only tried the pizza by the slice, so cannot comment on anything else.   Give it a try!

Stumbled upon this place thanks to Yelp. The food price is above the norm, like Spinatos, but still worth it. We ordered a plain pepperoni pizza that came out to about $23 for their 16inch. The crust, sauce and pepperoni were all delicious and even reminded me of pizza I had in Rome (i'm serious).   This will stay on my list of DELICIOUS pizza places. Next time i'll be sure to try the other items on the menu, like the lasagna (it looked amazing).

We always come to this place for some good wings:)   This place seems more family oriented than that one in Tempe, probably because the bar is separated from the dining area.. Waitresses are nice and attentive.

Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so very picky:  I eat here every so often with my boyfriend, its family owned and pretty darn good.   You'll find it in a small, almost deserted plaza on the NE corner of Mckellips and Mesa Dr. I like it so much, I brought my family here this past saturday, they seemed kinda hesitant cause of the location and it not having the normal chain name (ihop, dennys, village inn)..but they loved it.. my brother is pretty picky about his biscuits and gravy, but he approved.. weirdo.   The usual older man at the front is the owner I think. He is very nice and very welcoming...but the older lady that serves is kinda questionable? maybe i just come on one of her stressed out days? She serves the tables in The Duke room, anyway she warms up towards the end, maybe cause she knows the tip is coming. She forgot to bring our drinks that day, but remembered when she came out with the condiments... no big deal.   Food prices are decent for the portion, but i noticed they did go up within the year.. still good though.   oh and they serve breakfast up till 2pm, which is also the closing time.

Never say never i know, but this place NEVER disappoints!! This place is the best place for great beer and great food. Always have been a fan and i'm finally writing a review, sorry!   Just make sure you get there early and be prepared to wait for a table, its always packed on the weekends.  *SIDE NOTE-Make sure you show the server the amount and methods of payment before you hand back. We placed a twenty and debit card in check folder, but she lost the twenty between our table and the register and she charged us all on the card. Luckily she believed us when we mentioned the cash and corrected the bill.

A place for ultra-cool hipsters.. might as well sell PBR.  Sadly some people don't know what clothing should be bought or sold for, so this place seems like a great find. .

When am i not here? This is my nerdy boyfriends:) go to place for parts, so we're always here shopping and browsing. They have everything needed for building a computer, movies, music, electric stuff, software.. and pelican luggage.. which is what our last visit was for. I just hate the sometimes long line that seems never ending...

Ok so the only time i come here is with a restaurant.com certificate.. Good deal usually.  The total comes down from $35-50 to $15-25...depending on group size (i'm usually there with 3-5 ppl) not bad, yes it is kinda weird they have you tip 18% there...only because there is no service to tip. You pay and order at the counter..  oh well the sushi maker needs it.   The food is great, I always order water everywhere i go, so can't comment on drinks. Oh the green tea sorbet or icecream is yummy! its served in a bowl with 3 scoops, good for up to 4 people maybe..  Yes and the decor gets kind of boring after awhile......kinda like a clean institution? ikea, ikea, ikea..............  But yeah try it out:)  oh and its a pretty small place, not that good for groups.. they have one long table in the middle and a few tables around..

It was fun and lively for a Thursday night. Very scottsdale-ish... Tight dresses, tons of makeup and guys in affliction shirts...eww.  It was a mix of cougar and cougarettes, young and old...i mean mature:)  Casual and Dressy attire everywhere..  The bar was having a special on imported beer, and a guy bought a round of drinks for everyone there..so that is a plus for being in Scottsdale I guess.   I'll try to go back sometime and try the food...

The only reason I give 4 stars  is because I can't bring in a big party! haha... It is that good, love the food, the drinks, and how snug it is.   I brought my boyfriend here awhile back and he kinda had a confused look on his face when we walked throught the door and sat down. But as soon as he read the menu and beer list he was happy. Now I hear he likes to take his co-workers there:)  If you love the "homecooked" food feel, then go there... whose home?... I don't know, not mine for sure, maybe if I had an old english grandmother I guess.   Just arrive before 7 on weekends, it gets packed late into the night. Its not that big inside, so if your claustrophobic sit near the back by the door...you'll see some light:)

My laptop flat lined and I didn't know why, just one day it didn't turn on. I cam here based on the yelp reviews and happy I did. Although my laptop couldn't be revived due to the fried motherboard, they did give me a full explanation about what they found and my best options. I was grateful they didn't charge me for looking into the problem, other places would have. I will definitely be coming back if needed..

Love this place, they have good deal on gently worn clothes.. Now before you head there, you need to realize this place is for bargain shoppers who love to shop. Your not going to see things catorgorized to the T, but sweaters here, tops there, shoes up there kinda place. You have to be willing to look!   So don't complain if you're too lazy to look!!   I always come here first if I want to recycle my clothing and they always give me a fair deal:) better than any other place I've been. The buyback price varies, something like $2-4 for shirts, $4-6 for heels, etc.. first off don't buy tons of items not wearing any, then cry when they won't give you full price. They are going to buy it for half of what they are going to sell it for. Set up your own yard sale!  If you can't handle it, don't shop or sell there.

Worst manager and worker on May 21st 2016!!   This is a customer service business, and denying customers the chance to order from their first choice is bad business. The door clearly stated the closing time as 12am but when we arrived at 10:30pm, a young worker with brunette hair ran to the door and locked it in our face without saying a word, she then turned and snickered at another employee. We then decided to call thinking they were doing delivery only, (even then she could've said that to us at the door) but we were hung up on when she was taking our order.   The hotel we were staying at has promotions of Papa Johns in the rooms but with enough complaints I'm sure they can change that since no one wants to be affiliated with poor reviews. I understand you have a life outside of your work, but you are on the clock and you are there as the face of Papa Johns.   Bad service and bad business, this definitely could've been handled better by the workers..but then again it's just papa johns..what really irks me is lazy employees, especially when they think they need a raise but don't have the basic skill or ability to run a business.   BTW: We went to Hungry Howies and they had our order ready to go in 20 minutes:)

This place has alot of stores I love to shop at. I can spend the whole day looking down the main mall area then onto the stores surrounding it.   Just sucks the restrooms are way out of the way, best places, near mojo yogurt, barnes&noble, and paradise bakery.. haha  On the weekend they have local bands playing on the stage and the night owls come out to play... so its fun for everyone..  Only thing I question is the signs you see around the marketplace..........Why are there only white people in them?

This place never disappoints... The food is great and prices reasonable for the restaurant, not an everyday kind of thing. ..  I almost always come here with my boyfriend when we feel like having a great dinner night out...located right at tempe marketplace, you can walk right to the theater from there. I always order water with lemon at restaurants, but here it has to be the sweet tea...the huge mason jars with mint are a great combo...yummy:)  The weekdays are quieter, but on the weekend they have a band playing the blues, so I dont' mind waiting for a table while listening to the music.  The place is very comfortable, the staff is always helpful and welcoming..   The smoked chicken pasta is delicious, they used to have a pork chop plate with a tasty glaze and a sweet potato pancake, which was a favorite, but it's no longer served:( I don't know why i'm even mentioning it, but guess we both can't have it anyway, sweet memory i guess...haha  Fried green tomatoes very good as well for a starter, if you order the rib tip as a starter you might not have room left for main course,They have huge portions so expect to take some home or share with someone. My boyfriend usually orders the catfish or steak, he's never had complaint- had a few bites myself, they are both really good.. The gumbo and jambalaya are very tasty and spicy, but more hot sauce never hurts....  All in all, the place is relaxing, the food is great And the staff is very friendly..

Love a good ol' brewery, this place hits the spot...well enough:) My boyfriend and I love argue about which valley brewery we think is better, I'm more of a 4Pks fan myself, while he would choose this place any day... oh well:) I did enjoy myself the one time I was there. The place is pretty big and busy during lunch time, but was seated quickly. The food was pretty darn tootin' good too, but the beer.... I couldnt decide, I am more of a cider, ambery, wheat-ish, light on its feet kinda beer sipper, but I ordered something that was too thick and bitter for my taste, which was recommened by our waitress. Next time I'll sample each and see which fits me better.  I will definitely visit again, when I'm in the area:)

Paintball aspect was fine a dandy, the young guy inside the arena was very helpful and welcoming............................................... but the experience before made me not want to spend my money there.  I wanted to treat my younger brother out for his birthday, so I dropped him and our cousin off to get started. I left and ran a few errands before I joined them, but when I returned about an hour later, they were still sitting in the main area on the tables. I asked them why they weren't already playing, and my brother said they told him there was no available equipment yet. No equipment available? there was only a handful of people there, so I went to the front to see what was going on. Well I waited, and waited, several workers saw me, and then another group came up too, suddenly someone was there and asked them first if they wanted to play.. I of course spoke up and said I had been waiting before them and the kid finally helped me, but didn't show me the same helpfulness.  We watched the video then walked to the back to get the equipment, I looked around as the kid was getting everything, and they had a whole wall full of paintball guns and safety gear... I asked if they were all working and available, the kid said yeah. hmm... really.   If you haven't guessed it yet, I'm brown.  Teach those kids some manners and educate them. Obviously they have some personal problems, otherwise your business needs a "whites only" sign on the front door.   Never going back, and never recommending it.

Very yummmy:) We ordered from the lunch menu about 1pm in the afternoon, it was busy so we waited for our table..not long, maybe about 5mins. If we were a smaller party we probably wouldve been seated sooner, alot of seats for 2-4 groups.It is very nice and cozy inside, they were very welcoming and attentive. Our waitress was great and very hospitable. The food and drinks came out very fast, they sure know how to keep up with the hustle and bustle of the downtown lunch rush, so i recommend this place if your in a hurry!  The lunch plate is enough for 1-2 people, 5 of us shared 3 plates and left pretty satisfied. They bring out miso soup with water to start, always my favorite.   Overall pretty good! The thai tea is always best in the summer!

This place is TASTY! Love the pho and spring rolls... awesome food and prices.......but one thing i had a problem with was when I order the appetizers. Make it clear how many orders you want. The last time I ordered 1 order of the 2 spring rolls, so my boyfriend and I could have one each, but the server brought out 4 and charged me twice. This also happened with a larger group... 2 orders came out to 4 orders.. i think the server counted the people and assumed we want 2 each.. anyhoo...its yummy and cheap, not a big deal. Peanut sauce is great on everything, I mean everything...

This little place can be good or evil....... depends on the day/time..  Well to start off I do enjoy coming here whenever i'm on this side of town. This is the best place for cheap eats thats filling and delicious... during happy hour that is... Cause you can't beat $3.50 Gyros, $6 Pizzas, etc...  The pizzas are big enough for 2-3 people or one hung over person. Oh and just look over your check before you pay, they messed up a few times by not adding HR prices and mixing up the checks.. oh bother.  On the weekends, it's a good place to stop off for that first drink to get your feet wet. They usually do 2-4-1 drinks until 12pm, so my friend and i usually split the  cost. And well yeah those drinks can sneak up on you, so be careful..    The different times I was there I enjoyed the music they played, dance, old school hiphop...etc.. And its a mix of people so thats always nice, unlike the other places, this place has different people all the time.

I love the food...BUT the service is horrible. I am writing this update because I recently visited them again and well the service didn't change. There was at most 3 groups of ppl around 4pm and the waitress would disappear for long periods of time, for awhile we all glanced at one another and I know we all silently thought "where the heck did she go?"  We had to wave her down if we wanted something... she seemed like she didn't care to serve, but it's what you were hired for- Remember!?  I left annoyed, but full of good food:)    (if you want to know which server i mean, she has really bad hair coloring-blond/black?)

OK, so there seems to be a party going on here everyday!. my local grocery store has never made me want to dance like this place does..haha...so when you want a quick pick me up, head over there:) Music is upbeat, place is colorful, food is delicious and fresh made drinks pretty darn tasty too! Nothing beats the cheap prices for the quanity and quality of food. The Tacos are gooooood.......As for the store part if it, they have a huge selection of things, haven't shopped there much, but the food never fails...

This place has become a family spot since we discovered it. The prices are amazing and the food is superb! I tried the boba thai tea (2.99), Vietnamese coffee, pho (reg under $6), spring rolls, and some other yummy dishes..still trying to work my way through the menu. They start getting pretty busy in the evenings after 7pm, so come a little earlier if possible.

I've only been to other locations around the valley, but finally had a chance to visit during my lunch break with my family. I must say the line looked pretty long as we pulled in to find parking, and we almost left thinking it would take forever. Luckily we didn't leave and to my surprise the line zipped by and everything we ordered was delicious.   Besides their good food, I was pleased with their customer service and speed. Everyone was friendly even though the place was crowded with students and business people on their lunch break. The manager (?) came around and asked how everything was and gave my family children vouchers for free meals the next time they visited. We were happily surprised with the service and thoughtfulness and a little later when leaving another employee asked if we had a good meal.   I would definitely come back to this location again:)

Been there more than a few times, but never ordered food.....until now. I stopped in late about 9pm after class one day and ordered a carne asada burrito and drinky-drank to sip on. I saw no other customers, so I wasn't sure if they were still serving food, but one of the guys there said he'll be right with me. I ordered my food and after he was finished cooking the meat, he let me pick and choose what I wanted inside my burrito too.   Well good thing I got there when I did, because when I was finished paying the line was already 7 people deep and bustling with customers.   Service: The cook, cashier and a random worker were all friendly and didn't get creepy vibe at all.. haha  Food: I wish I took a picture before I started but it was huge! I ate half and saved the rest for lunch the next day.   This place is good any time of day and not just for those late night after partying food cravings...well maybe that too:)

So i'm an avid movie watcher, love to go out and enjoy a good flick with my boyfriend.....but when you have kids running around and babies crying, it ruins the night. .....  Which brings me to UltraStar Theater: This place is awesome...you can get upgraded to star class, which bascially means no one under 21 allowed!...yep not allowed even with a parent. They have a separate family friendly screening. So yeah I love it.....plus you can order food, 10X better than harkins food and you can enjoy a nice glass of beer.. $7 for a blue moon was ok but cheaper elsewhere of course.  So if you hate when people/kids bump your seats, come here and enjoy the space, food and drinks...  Oh and the service was awesome too, so friendly and ready to serve!

I decided to try this place based on my cravings for Indian food in addition to the yelp reviews. I've only tried the basic korma curry and samosas, but will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu...eventually. haha. The prices were decent and affordable for the college/family budget. I had take away so I can't comment on the service, but the girl who rang up my order was very welcoming and nice. Tip: Grab some craft beer or wine next door and you're good to go! haha

It seems a lot bigger than the other locations, I always forget that this place is here, because the location is somewhat new. We visited for late lunch on a Sunday and shared the Caesar (Jr size) salad and wings... Both delicious and enough for 2-3 ppl.. I was hungry and didn't believe that the Jr. size would be enough, but it was! Had my food with a side of beer, what's not to like about this yummy lunch.    The servers and hostess were both pleasant and very attentive!   I will definitely remember to come back to this location soon!

Good beer selection and pretty decent choices on the food menu. This place has a huge outdoor patio that's perfect for those spring/summer/fall evenings. The majority of the seating is large communal tables, makes it a little awkward if there's only two of you.   I will be going back to try the brats and the different sliders.

WOWZA!! Try this place ASAP! Too good to pass up, especially on those hot summer days. I love the Thai Chew, all the different ingredients taste amazing together! If i'm ever on that side I always make a stop for snoh, Thai tea or the iced coffee. I will definitely be back again...and again :)

Visited on a Monday morning with a party of 8 people. The place was right off the road and canal, very convenient parking and we were seated right away.   Food: Delicious diner breakfast! Not too greasy and the plates were enough to share. The prices averaged $8-11am per person.   I will definitely visit again. Yummy!

Ahhhh where to start? I love Korean food and this just hits the nail on the head. FYI-This restaurant prepares the meat for you, so no grill on the table top. However don't let that stop you from visiting (I always like grilling my own meat.), but still a wonderful meal with all the fixings. Most specialty meat dishes like Bulgogi ($17.99) are over $15, and they are enough for 2 people.

Stopped by for a quick bite to eat before the Dbacks game and was surprised by how cheap and delicious the pizza was! I will definitely be back for more and have already told some friend how good it was. The only thing is that I wish they served bottled beer or margs like chipotle...haha. But yeah make a stop, your wallet and tummy will be satisfied:) It was $5.99 for their regular topping pizzas and 7.99 for specialty ones. I had the Hawaiian pizza that was only $5.99!

So my boyfriend found this place during a fast online search for sushi. I'm super happy we decided to give it a try because it was so worth it!  okay so basically as of 6/11/16 the lunch price is $12.99 and dinner $21 for all-you-can-eat sushi plus other food on the menu(A LOT MORE). The catch is that you have to eat it all with no waste otherwise they will charge for leftovers not consumed. That being said, I did notice they add a lot of rice to the sushi, but not overly crazy. I recommend ordering the 6 pieces instead of the 1 hand-roll since the handroll is 80% rice and fills you up faster and equal to 3 rolled pieces. The 6 piece rolls have more flavor and are actual sushi rolls.   Holy cow we had our fill and enjoyed it all:) We will definitely be going back!

These fast build-your-own pizza places are great in a hurry and surprisingly very tasty. I usually order something off the menu like Marguerita or hawaiian pizza, but always add jalapenos. On my last visit I ordered a side of caesar salad and boy that thing was huge. you can order a pizza and salad to share with one or two people, but I'm pretty sure you'll be alright alone. The veggies are always fresh and service is great!   It never occurred to me to write a review, but the service this last time was *super* great.

Decided to drop by on a hot 110 degree AZ day to try their thai tea with boba. Welp, I've had way better... should've gone to my usual spot.   First: the workers have no concept of customer service. Second: the drink was a major fail, I never thought I could be disappointed in a simple drink made from powder.   The drink was watery and the boba was old, lacking all things boba.  Not going back.
