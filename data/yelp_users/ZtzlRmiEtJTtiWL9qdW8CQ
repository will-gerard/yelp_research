Food, coffee, & tea are pretty good. Iced tea costs $3 a cup, but they will overfill the cup with ice. Then they have a sign that says they do not do refills, citing some gibberish about "heath code reasons" or whatnot. I know for a fact that this is not true, as l have worked in several restaurants myself. We asked a manager at another Paradise Bakery about this & they said that this is completely out of policy. I tried to look for a corporate phone number on the company website, but evidently there is none. I do understand that many of the locations are franchisees, but this is no way to run a company. Won't return~

I've tried them all and this is the best Gyro in all of Phoenix.  Big, meaty portions, Tzatziki Sauce made w/ Greek yogurt~not sour cream.  This is a family~owned restaurant.  My wife and I have been coming here for years & will continue to as well.

Best auto mechanic shop in the Valley if you ask me. I live a little ways away, but drive the extra distance to have vehicles worked on by Frank. His staff are really nice guys. Honest, affordable family owned business. Very rare in the automotive repair industry these days. Keep up the great work guys!

Cool place, great music/food. The entree & dessert pies are great, covered with delicious French pasty & full of culinary goodness. Maybe a few too many hipsters for my taste, but will still return all the same.

Never used their service, and never will.  Yesterday I was driving along side one of their cars in Glendale, and one of their drivers~a 400 lb. behemoth of a man rolls down his window and litters a bunch of paper all over the street.  I tried to call the company, but evidently their is no supervisor EVER available, and no way to even leave a message.  Rude operators too~I'm done here.  Edit~l'll bump it up to 2 stars because Jason P. addressed the situation so quickly & cordially. Still have never used this company, l rideshare!

Great service! Half the price of a taxi cab, cleaner vehicles & friendlier drivers. A no brainer to me!

DO NOT DEAL WITH THESE PEOPLE!!! You have been warned. They are dishonest from top to bottom. They have great looking "ringers" with low miles advertised on websites everywhere, but guess what?? They exist only as prevalent as unicorns do in the Eastern Sonoran Desert. When they don't have the vehicle that they used to entice you onto their slimy lot, they will always tell you that they haven't updated their online inventory yet. Same ringers up 2 months later though, that's a sure bet. They will attempt to charge you a nearly $700 window tinting fee on every car there~whether it rolled on the lot tinted or not. They sales manager fought desperately like a rabid 'possum when l tried to leave the lot. So take from all of this what you will..

Great rideshare app, easy to use, affordable & handy anytime day or night. The drivers are usually really cool & sometimes very interesting too. I will continue to use Lyft, thx guys!
