As the city is growing more, labs need to be open till 7 or 8! Taking off work for this is not always and option, that's why people like me and others are looking for later lab openings! Your employees can't wait to shut the doors on time! Get 2 shifts and quit overworking them!

Dr. Lee is the best doc. He puts my daughters ear tubes in right in the office with very little discomfort. He is very gentle and kind. We see a lot of doctors due to a lot of health issues and he is for sure 5 stars plus!!!!

This is a great place to take your kids,because they offer kids cuts for 8.00 on saturdays.. Everyone made you feel comfortable and gave me a list of specials for the next time.I even got my own hair done while waiting for my little boys hair cut. They gave me the best  hair color,it goes great with my skin tone.
