Omg! The oven baked pancakes are heavenly and worth the 20 wait. They could use another waitress, but the food is worth it.

One would think that finding a decent happy hour location in Old Town Scottsdale would be easy, but in fact, it is not. There are places that seem to have great prices, or great atmosphere, or great food, but it seems none of them ever go together. Why is that?!  Recently, we visited Mabel's on Main, which is located on (wait for it), Main Street in Old Town Scottsdale. Mabel's is typically a great bar to check out on a Friday or Saturday night if you are looking for a club-like atmosphere, but not real busy during the week. Some may appreciate that, especially for happy hour. The rectangle bar is located in the middle of the space, surrounded by dark woods, leather booths and a few dining tables. It's quite dark and dingy, which lends to the loungy atmosphere. The service is always friendly and attentive, which is good. But it's the food on their happy hour list that needs improvement. And be careful to try to understand how their happy hour operates when you look it up online. Their website boasts that their is in fact a happy hour menu, and their Wednesday special is $20 bottles of wine. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, it is. Once we got there, turns out that you can't order the $20 bottle of wine AND also enjoy the happy hour food prices. You can only have one or the other. What? Isn't saving money the point of happy hour for customers?  Anyway, of the 13 items on their happy hour "matinee" menu, we tried four. First we ordered the butter lettuce with beets and sherry vinaigrette, but sadly, they said they were all out. Didn't they just open? Okay, so next, after needing more time to reconvene our decision, we started with the deviled eggs three ways. You get six, and we have to say, they are just okay, they don't suck, but it's not like you couldn't make them at home the same. Moving on, we tried the wedge salad. I traded the blue cheese dressing for the sherry vinaigrette on the side, but my friend stuck with the blue cheese, which was literally drowning the lettuce. Honestly, wedge salads are so boring and have no nutritional value. I would be much more impressed if they offered a spinach salad option.  Oh, let me mention here that of all the options on their menu, the ONLY vegetable choices were the butter lettuce and wedge salad. Not cool for someone who wants to stay away from bread and is trying to consume more veggies. Anyway, I digress. We also ordered the Swedish meatballs and the chicken lollipops. The meatballs were decent, but small, but tasty. The chicken lollipops were poorly described on the menu, only indicating that they came with a house ranch sauce. I had imagined some chicken skewers coming out with a tasty dip, but that was definitely not the case. What showed up was four fat little drumsticks, buffalo wing style. By that I mean that they were covered and cooked in some sort of buffalo sauce. This should have been mentioned on the menu, because I do not like anything buffalo sauce flavored. And their ranch sauce was pitiful, in taste and amount supplied, so I had to dig into my friends extra slop of blue cheese dressing left behind from her wedge.  Other menu choices we could have picked included flatbreads, burgers, grilled cheese, mac n' cheese and soft pretzels. All great bar food I suppose, but then why the dining tables? However, what I will say is that if you like this type of food then the happy hour prices are definitely right, ranging from $4 to $11. And glasses of select wine for only $5. We walked out of there having two appetizers and two glasses of wine for only $22 each. Not a bad deal. I was just disappointed in my food intake. I really don't like to be disappointed about that. It's the one thing I hope to count on when I go out. Unfortunately, we decided we probably won't be back there anytime soon for their happy hour food.

If you love authentic tacos, not just the ones from taco bell or filibertos, then you will love the taco menu at Barrio Queen. The taco menu consists of 20 different types of street tacos to choose from. And you can try one of each if that is what you wish, or order all of the same kind. It's up to you, which is what I love about it. One of my favorite flavors includes the Salmon y Mango taco, with chilled chunks of smoked salmon, diced mango and pico de gallo, served on a tiny corn tortilla. Delicious! I also tried the Carne Asada taco with fresh orange and garlic marinated grilled beef, topped with diced onion, cilantro and avocado., as well as the El Pastor taco with chile and spice marinated pork topped with diced onion, cilantro, pineapple, and salsa borracho.  Tacos is not all they serve either. Their menu includes enchiladas, tortas, burritos, quesedillas, and more. Barrio Queen serves up some authentic Mexican flavors while adding in their own rendition of spices and other ingredients to stand out from the crowd.  If you haven't tried this place yet, you need to. Excellent food! And don't forget to order their Barrio signature guacamole made table side - chunks of fresh avocado, pomegranate seeds, diced red onion, and maybe one other ingredient I can't remember. AWESOME!

restaurant is now open in Scottsdale. The first Searsucker restaurant opened in 2010 in San Diego by Bravo's Top Chef, Brian Malarkey, and Brian has recently opened a Searsucker in Scottsdale as well.  Located on the northwest corner of Camelback and Goldwater, Searsucker has taken over a 9,500 square foot space inside an office building. Large, inviting, rustic, yet classy is how I would describe the decor upon first entering. Large planks of rustic wood cover the windows and walls, the high ceilings with lights draped in thick rope offer the perfect dim lighting, and the rustic style wood tables lend a boat-like appeal, while a few couches and chairs fill the middle of the space lending a loungy area as well. The square bar near the front has plenty of space to enjoy hand-crafted cocktails and food, while the dining room seats approximately 150. The music is fun and upbeat which keeps the mood high as well. And the service that evening couldn't have been more attentive, friendly or helpful.  On to the menu! Executive Chef Malarkey's menu is both serious and fun, with dishes divided into categories like, 'Bites,' 'Greens,' 'Ocean,' 'Ranch,' 'Farm' and 'Ands'. The waiter first delivered our bread to the table, which they call cheddar puffers. These delectable little balls of joy were similar to the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster (c'mon, who doesn't know about and love those), only these were pumped up on steroids a bit. Yum! Then, sticking to my usual regime of ordering as much food to taste as possible, I always must try the mussels whenever on a menu. These mussels were served with chorizo and toast ($12). The chorizo added a nice flavor in every bite. Next, the egg and bacon "pork belly" small plate ($12). This is the kind of dish that you might make inappropriate faces while eating, it's that good. We also tried a tuna tartar that night as well, served with wonton chips ($12). And of course, we had to order a dessert as well, which included peanut butter ice cream, nuts and caramel. Um, HELLOOOOO! Delicious.  Offering a full bar and a decent wine menu, this is not only a great place to start for happy hour, but a fun place to dine with friends or a date.
