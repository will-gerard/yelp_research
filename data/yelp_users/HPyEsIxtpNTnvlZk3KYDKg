Went in today because my tire kept going flat.  I had purchased many times from this location and they have always been great.  This time was exceptional.  They promptly greeted me and took my car in for inspection.  It was done in about 25 minutes and was no charge due to the tires having a warranty from them.  I am not sure if it would have been free otherwise, but another discount tire location fixed my tire for free once when something happened to my factory tires that came from the dealership.  Overall a great, fast experience!

One of the best workouts in Scottsdale! Love the instructors- especially the owner Shandi. She really keeps the classes moving and definitely knows how to work and tone all of the muscle groups without the bulk.  These classes are high intensity!  If you enjoy barre style classes but wish to incorporate cardio and strength to your workout this is for you.

This place is a great little gem in this area!!! I am so excited that it is near my house and they also deliver! You can get sushi and chinese!! Whatever you are feeling. The rolls are always fresh and tasty and their 1/2 price sushi deal is amazing.

Worst cleaning service I have ever used. It took me contacting the voucher company that I purchased for them to call me back, then when they called they back they were super rude and unprofessional. I was going to see how they did at cleaning before I left a bad review, and to no avail, this was the worst house cleaning I have ever gotten.  Left spots all over the floor, we had to consistently ask them to sweep different places.  AWFUL! DO NOT USE THEM EVER!

Love the whole Amenzone concept and the workouts are great! I especially notice definition in my arms after starting these workouts.  Pullups, pushups, and lots of workouts with the tire are really effective.  Love the boxing workouts and most of the instructors are amazing.

The workouts here are great, and for anyone.  Everyone does the same thing but you can kind of go at your own pace and you are never racing against anyone.  The people are very friendly and you will definitely notice a change after the first week.  I workout regularly at many different high intensity classes, and my muscles have been sore after several of these classes!  Get a living social or groupon or just try it for a week.  That is how I tried it and I was hooked after a few classes.
