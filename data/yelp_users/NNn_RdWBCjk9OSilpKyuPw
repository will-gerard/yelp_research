I really like the location of this restaurant but after eating there this past monday i don't think I would come again. We sat in the resturant and our waitress seemed nice.  I ordered the teriyaki beef (medium rare) with rice but when it came I found it overcooked and kind of hard and chewy. So I asked her if she put in the order as medium rare like I had asked and she said no but she could make me a new one (she was kind of rude about it though). But we had already waited so long for our food that I didn't want to make the others wait for me because they were almost done with their food so i declined. I continued to slowly eat and talk to my family when the waitress came over again and asked if i would like the food taken off the bill since it wasn't made correctly. Of course I said yes because why would i pay if i wasn't enjoying the food and she offered so why not. but as soon as i said yes she abruptly picked up my plate of food that i was still eating, i mean the chopsticks were still in my hand hovering over the plate, then walked off. Everyone at my table looked at each other in shock. WTF? seriously? when she came back I asked if she was coming back with the food and she said no because i wanted it off the bill she took it, but she never explained to me or asked me if it was ok to take the plate that i was still eating off of. She was so rude about it. So finally i just decided to have them remake the food and it was ok. But after that experience I don't think I could ever go back. They still charged me for the food since they remade it but it was awkward and no longer an enjoyable dinner after that.

I had bought a grouping for an oil change. I have to make an appointment a week in advance but the service was good and they didn't try to up sell me into doing a bunch of stuff I didn't need. I will go back :)

Bank of America as a whole sucks. Switched to chase and it was the BEST decision I ever made. I closed down my bank account IN PERSON a year ago and it stayed open for some reason? Since then, they have been changing me a maintenance fee every month for having the acct open. Relations manager Troye was absolutely no help. She said that I had to pay off the negative balance if I wanted to close my acct even thought I had already closed it. She looked at the history of the acct and sees when I "thought" I had closed it but even though I went in to close it, it doesn't guarantee that it will close... What? In the end I paid my negative balance for no reason and "closed" my acct. but we will see since it isn't guaranteed. What a joke of a bank. No wonder they are closing a ton of branches..

The park is separated into a small dog park and a big dog park which is a good idea but inconvenient for me because I have both a small and big dog. Another thing I noticed when I was last there was that there was a group of people all with their huskies, id say at least 8-10 of them. I have nothing against huskies or any dog for that matter but they seemed to be very aggressive towards other new dogs whom they did not know. Im guessing that these dogs always hang out with each other and so kind of have some kind of park deal going on because they teamed up against this one dog that had come in and it got to the point where the dog was yelping and the owner had to leave because the other dog owners weren't doing anything and just laughing as their dogs bullied another dog. it was really sad. nothing against the park itself but this experience just turned me off from coming back.

I can't comment on the food because I am still currently sitting at the restaurant and I just placed my order but honestly I already want to leave. The server is so rude I am contemplating leaving. They aren't even busy and she is acting like she is so overwhelmed. As soon as my boyfriend sat down he was looking at the menu looking for the drink menu and the server came over and he stated that he has never been here before and was looking for the drink menu and she didn't even point it out to him. She just said "ok, I'll be back" and took off. I decided to giver her another chance so I put in my order and handed her the menu and she roughly yanked it out of my hand and walked away. If I didn't already order food, I would just leave.

Their big rig with sausage is to die for! It is so delicious I wish I could have it all the time. But since it is kind of pricey, I tend to get it less than I would like. The service is always good here but wait times to get a table on the weekend nights are kind of long sometimes so come early!

I'm literally obsessed with chipotle but this location wasn't very professional. My boyfriend and I went today 11/29/15 at 5:30 and I went and ordered a steak bowl and it was at the bottom of the steak and wasn't a lot left. Steak didn't look appetizing at all. Asked her if they were making new steak and she look annoyed and said "no, there's enough" then scooped half a scoop in my bowl. Asked for a "tiny bit" more and she just looked at me and ignored my request. Then as we were paying they brought out new steak. I asked the friendly cashier if I could have a small cup of the new steak since I got barely any and it didn't look appetizing and he was nice enough and got some for me. As he was getting it, she looked annoyed at him and was like "that's for you right?!" And when he explained it was for me she looked at me and rolled her eyes.... Rude.

I honestly can comment much on their food because I have not eaten here much and the only thing I have ever ordered from here was their cheese curds which by the way is AMAZING! This place is right by where I live so we drive thru for cheese curds when we want a quick snack and a drink. This last time we went after our trip to the dog park so we had our dogs with us and the driver thru cashier was so nice to our dog and gave him some dog treats! Now my boyfriend has had their cheeseburgers and he did think they were good.

Kinda sucks that I have to leave a bad review. I wanted to like this this place but I didn't even have a chance. First off, I tried to call and schedule an appointment but they didn't answer their phone so I leave a message to call me back. No call back. I tried again the next day and as soon as I got someone she asked if she could call me back in a minute, I said sure and gave her my cell number. I waited 5 hours before calling back. Finally I was able to schedule an appointment for my boyfriend and myself. Now today my boyfriend had his appointment today at 10:30am and he had to be at work at noon. We called to ask him he could come in earlier and the receptionist said that he could come in at 9:15 to do his X-rays and exam but cannot do his cleaning until 11. We asked him he could do that to try and save time. She then said it wouldn't make any difference and he would get out at the same time whether he came at 10:30 or 9:15 because either way his cleaning starts at 11. Ok makes sense. But she assured me they can get him done by 11:40 so that he could get to work on time, they even noted it on his chart. My boyfriend shows up to his appoint early to fill out the paper work then at his scheduled time he gets his X-rays and exam done but then they had him sitting there waiting for the cleaning and by 11:10 she asked the person how long and she said the cleaning would take 1 hour. He said ok well if it's going to take that long that he will reschedule. I called me after the situation and I called back asking if they were just running behind and the receptionist put me on hold to find out what happened. She then came back on he phone and said that they would have had him out by 11:40 but my boyfriend just seemed like he really wanted to leave... Uhm no that's a lie because I was on the phone with him while he was sitting there waiting and then asked how long it would be. She made it seem like my boyfriend just didn't want his cleaning done. She then started to have an attitude.. She then called me 5 minutes later to confirm my appointment for the next day because I never apparently never called them back the day before when they called me. I did call them back the day before but just decided to cancel my appointment. Super disappointed :(

Honestly I was reluctant to consign because of the negative reviews but decided to give it a try. My boyfriend and I came on Friday night and were both seated right away. The temp was a little warmer than I would have liked it but I quickly forgot about it. We sat and looked over the menu deciding what we wanted. The very kind waiter suggested the sobo wings with the green chili pineapple marmalade which WAS SO GOOD!! Then for our actual entree my boyfriend got a pepperoni pizza which was huge and delicious and I got the short rib, which was also amazing. Idk why there are any negative reviews. Give this place a chance, it was worth it to me :)

Usually have a good experience here but this last time i experienced horrible customer service. The girl whom i ordered my ticket from was very rude and snarky to me. I guess coming to the movies for my birthday was a bad idea because it ruined my whole mood. Told the manager about her behavior and he just said "uhhh ok" and looked at me like i was stupid. Go to amc, smaller theater but nice and friendly workers. Also its way cheaper.

Went to this place today at about 1pm (3/31/16). Honestly the location kinda sucks for a restaurant because it's kinda hidden in the back corner of this huge parking lot filled with car repair places. The restaurant itself was very spacious. There were about 5 tables filled with people. It was seat yourself. As soon as we walked in my boyfriend was pumped because they serve beer! We sat and ordered the garlic soy sauce chicken half order for $9.99. The portion was HUGE! So worth the price. Caution: it's very garlicky! So if you don't like garlic, order something else. Food was very good :) the waitress was very nice and attentive :) definitely coming back!
