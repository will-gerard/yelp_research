Around Thanksgiving, we went to Mint Thai for lunch (it being our usual thai lunch spot). What a mess. The food wasn't tasty when it arrived - and it had taken forever to get the attention of the waitress for anything. In the end, out of a party of 4, only 1 of us had received what we ordered, 1 of us was violently ill (and remained so for DAYS - having to visit the doctor, etc), 2 of us felt moderately ill later, and only one of us felt ok. Such a disappointment.

I've been to the Breakfast Club dozens and dozens of times, but I will never  go there again. On Saturday, I attempted to go with my husband and 2 friends - and the hostesses wouldn't seat us.   My friend and I got there and were told of a 30-40 minute wait. As we were waiting for our husbands to join us, this was no problem for us. Then..they got there, and we still weren't seated. When I went to check with the hostess, my name had been crossed off list. Now, we were waiting by the front door, but I know my name was never called. I was kind, understanding that mistakes are made, and I was informed that we would be seated next.   She then proceeded to seat a group of our size that had arrived after us. I went back up to the hostess station and demanded to know why people who had arrived long after us were being seated before us. The hostess lied to me, telling me that she hadn't told me we were to be seated next, but that we were just "coming up."   I was shocked that I was getting the runaround, so I took the news back to my group, and as we were discussing whether or not to leave, the hostess seated ANOTHER group of our size that had just arrived instead of us. At this point we got up to leave. The hostess, seeing we were leaving, said "you know you guys are coming up." Whether that was a taunt or what I will never know, but I do know that I will never go there again.   It was ridiculous to be treated like a second class citizen while trying to get breakfast. I would rather eat at Denny's, which I loathe, as I know they will at least seat and serve me.

A group of friends and I tried it out (was my second time eating here) last week and we ALL got sick. We all had different things, and the food was greasy and gross. I do not recommend this place and I won't be back.

Absolutely my fave local spot. I can always count on delicious fries (regular, cajun, steak, cajun steak), awesome burgers, and a completely delish grilled cheese sandwich (swap out the tomatoes for avocado). With great customer service, this genuine neighborhood bar and grill has a fantastic atmosphere and probably the best wing sauce in town. LOVE IT!

At this point, I've had three of the four crepe selections, with the Veg being the only one I haven't tried. The verdict is that they are fantastic.  With choices both sweet and savory, the real winner remains the My First Time, a collection of Nutella, Bananas, and Walnuts in warm fresh crepe. This is an amazing piece of food.   Now, in addition to all of the delicious delicious crepes, there are fries. And the fries are SO good. Made with Duck Fat, these are exquisite bits of fried potato. Combined with homemade dipping sauces, they just can't be beat. Check them out at Farmer's Markets around town. Go get some! They're delish! :)  Check out more pics and a longer review at http://rapunxelle.wordpress.com/
