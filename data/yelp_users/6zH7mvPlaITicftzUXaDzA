Been coming here for over 10 years. In that time they have been the only place I bring my car. No other car wash will clean your vehicle this well. In recent I have had a few minor concerns; staff turning up my radio and blasting my AC while cleaning it. I'm happy to say that after I mentioned it eventually it did stop. That's the thing with Cobblestone and manager Ryan. If they're not already doing an astounding job they will instantly rectify any concerns. You simply cannot get better a better wash or service here.

The restaurant is a little smaller than you might be used to, maybe it's the layout. About half of the square footage is upstairs with the pool table. The patio is nice and feels more roomy. The food is ok, not as good as Yard House, Rock Bottom, or O.S.H.O (which is right around the corner by the way). They do have some unique brews special to 4 Peaks, I recommend the Kilt Lifter.

Be advised! This place has NOT changed (they will tell you it has with new management). There are so many drawbacks about living here. I have had grass and leaves sprayed all over my new car from the landscapers, the mail man park in my space and I had a crying baby in my car, and even paint sprayed on my car while they were repainting the lines. . . Guess what, the office could care less!  Worst part is, we are currently trying to get our 2 year old to sleep while the Birds Nest is playing insanely loud music for the TPC event in Feb. Look, I'm not the old complaining type of person, I love having a good time! But, when it's 10pm 7 nights a week and I have to listen to my walls rattle (literally!) the office should have at LEAST let me know this could be something to be aware of. . . By the way it is Wednesday!  The place is very out dated and the plumbing here is AWFUL. We've been here a year now and have a plunger handy throughout the week. A friend of ours actually told us that they had terrible plumbing and they were very right. Plain and simple, the pace is 25 years old and they wanted to charge us $1,420 a month. Yes, it's near the Promenade and the 101 but you know what, Hayden is a terribly busy road.  Oh and...the maintenance here is incredible unprofessional and uneducated on their craft. We called them over once winter came because when we started the heater unit black smoke poured out and filled the apartment, it stank up our entire place for 3 days. They said it's normal and to run it until it stops. That sounded like an EXCELLENT idea for all of my furniture. On another occasion I had to tell them how to fix my washing machine, argued with him that the replacement part was under the washer for 10 mins because I wanted it fixed, he finally pulled it of and realized that it was an easy fix and fixed it. Seriously! So many problems here!!  It is not convenient finding a way onto the "private road" that the apartment sits on. The list continues. . . Honestly I was so happy moving in here, they couldn't have been nicer in the office. Seemed like it was sure to be the best place I've ever lived in my 32 years. Do yourself a favor and don't fall for it.   P.S. I've even written Pillar to complain and they don't care either.

Randy is always very considerate and helpful. It's nice to know that there are still some companies out there that value the customer.

So far I'm just ok with the gym. Been a member of 24 hour fitness for 8 years and finally made a switch to try out Golds Gym since it was closer to me. (I'm still a life time member at 24 hour). First impressions are always what you remember. Mine was not good at all. The girl that helped "sell" us our membership did not have any answers for us and probably wanted to be anywhere else but where she was, dealing with us. There was no explanation about the signup, contract, or questions we had about military discounts. She actually seemed upset that she was talking to us. It could just be because she's young and it's possibly her first job. Another girl at the front desk asked us what was going on when we were trying to figure things out so I explained our questions to her and she said she didn't know and then walked away immediately. There was one very helpful lady at the front desk, unfortunately she had no answers about anything either. Unfortunately, first impressions being what they are it left a poor taste in my mouth (hence the 2 stars). Theres still a chance for improvement. I did eventually get my answers but the reviews about one particular girl at the front is all too true. I'm a bit amazed that they haven't done anything about it considering.   The gym is busy after 3-4 pm, what gym isn't? Kids Club is AWESOME. The girls in there are great. Parking is terrible but that's not their fault at all, I don't mind a shirt walk.  Equipment works fine. Layout is a bit cramped and awkward but wasn't a big deal.  Bathrooms are kept very clean and nice.  I think the ladies workout room is a nice touch for the girls.  They have a small sauna in each bathroom. The circuit room is also a nice additive, although I'll never use it personally.   I hope that the contract rules and hardcore collections rumors are not true. We got their best plan. Now I'm a bit worried.   Maybe I'll meet friendlier staff in the weeks to come. If not I'll miss that about 24 hour fitness.

TERRIBLE!!! I have absolutely had it with this gym!  First the trainer gets into it with me on the gym floor after he takes the weights off of my bench press to re-rack them as I'm using them, and tells me that I'm going to be out of there because it's "his house".   Secondly, I hear that the morning child care lady is dragging my 1 year old across the floor. I try to ask Ryan (the "assistant" manager) to pull the video for it and he says he is not sure if he can.   Third, someone takes my things from the locker room and moves them, obviously playing games and I mention to Ryan that I'm over all not happy because I'm in a bad mood already about someone moving my personal property and he lectures me about not leaving my things unattended in the locker room. My point was that I'm already upset because of the quality of people that attend the gym. It's not the appropriate time to lecture a paying member with a (platinum membership of all things).   I am frustrated with him interrupting me to lecture me so I tell him to cancel my membership and he reply's happily, "absolutely! just call 1-800-...".  I wont even mention the promises that they made to me when we first signed up or the useless sales girl that showed us around as if she wanted to be anywhere else but at the gym.   They so very obviously do not care one bit about their members. Like someone else said, I really wish I could give them 0 stars. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  *24 hour fitness member for 10 years and I'll never go to another golds gym again.

I have sent a lengthy email to the President of Gold's gym, Aaron Watkins about my frustrations. . .  TERRIBLE!!! I have absolutely had it with this gym!

The absolute best place to shop and dine in Scottsdale, possibly in Arizona. I've lived in Arizona all my life, everywhere from Peoria, to Phoenix, to Tempe, and Scottsdale and there no no better location in all of Arizona. Dining might be a little more pricey but you get what you pay for. Shopping is the same price as it is anywhere so may as well enjoy the surroundings at Scottsdale Quarter!

Twenty 20 exceeded my expectation. My wife insisted we have our windows professionally cleaned so we called this local company. Customer service is far beyond what I ever expected. This is a lost practice, it's so enjoyable to see a hardworking man treat his clients like friends.   Loyal customers hence fourth!

Fantastic customer service! Even when my bill came, after I got unwarranted service done there the representative was more than kind when explaining it to me until I was fully understood. I asked for them to pick me up down the road because I had no other way to pick my SRX up and they gladly sent a driver.   The only down side is that they told me one day turn around and it took two. Not a big deal for as much as they had to fix, I just wasn't expecting it.

I previously reviewed this company with a great review on their service center. Mario is excellent. I had to re-write my review now that I just purchased a 2016 SRX. Stan is absolutely incredible. The entire staff, manager, director, and everyone I saw was beyond helpful and nice.   I cannot say enough about this company. It's not just the best place to purchase a car it might just be the best company for customer service and excellent period. (yes, I feel that strongly).   If you go you absolutely have to use Stan...seriously!   Very, very satisfied!

Absolutely the best food you'll have. The only draw back is that the kids who work the line and register there are a bit off. It's frequent that my order will get messed up but at least you can watch them make it so you can correct them. They simply work too fast as if their under constant pressure.   It's still new so we'll see if it gets better. . .
