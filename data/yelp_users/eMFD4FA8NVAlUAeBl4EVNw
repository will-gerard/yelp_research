The buying experience with any dealership, I found it to be as expected. The reason I gave them a one star was their after care in the VW department. I complained in a letter form of my various complaints, with a cc to Volkswagen headquarters. The local dealership never responded to my complaint. However, the corporate office did call but can't help because the dealership is locally owned. I would avoid this dealership due to their rating coaching and lack of care after the sale.

This place rocks! The food is absolutely delicious. The Hummus is amazing and only fresh ingredients are used. We try to go there weekly as it is that good.

Lou Gordon and his team made the car buying experience one of the best experiences I have ever had. If you are thinking about buying a new or used mercedes I would highly recommend Lou and his team!

We attempted to get quotes from Paddock and Shasta pools. No response. We did get quotes from Thunderbird, Presidential, Tribal waters and Cameo pools. Only Tribal and Thunderbird pools really understood what we really wanted. In the end we met with Les and toured some of their work by real homeowners. The quality and craftsmanship was by far superior and made our simple. We told them what we wanted and they came through. Yesterday we had our final meeting with them. It was a bitter sweet goodbye. We  will miss Lisa and Cohl because they are genuinely wonderful and professional people. If you go anywhere else, you have gone the wrong direction. What we ended up in the end was exactly what we had  hoped for. Thank you for a wonderful experience. Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions. This company is exceptional. Thanks Thunderbird Pools!

I was shocked to see all the negative reviews. Is this place Ruth Chis? No. However for the value and what you get I think its pretty good. Check out the tuna noodle skroddle and Strawberry shortcake...Yum!

This place looks great after their remodel. The salad bar was amazing and the food tasted great. Clifford, our server, was super nice and helpful. I will be back!

I was treated so horribly by Susan from cosmetics. Unless you like poor customer service, a management team that doesn't return a call and a totally disorganized store, then I would suggest this is your place. If you don't. Stay clear.

This place is always on wait, but well worth your time. After being discovered by Diners, Drive in and Dives, this place is jam packed. I love their pancakes and peppered bacon. MMM...my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Yum!

One hour on the phone to try to fix an email problem, then I get transferred to a different department, who then stated that they couldnt help to then get transferred to a different person who stated that they couldnt help me with their own service! I wish they had Centurylink in my neighborhood. Maybe they dont give a shit because they dont have to. Given a choice: run forrest run!

Got a notice for the preferred customer sale last week for their sale on April 21, 2011. Their flyer stated that they had been successful in arranging with their suppliers to stage a fabulous clearance at their store. They had arranged for special discounts, including electrolux, however when I went to the store, they said that Electrolux was not on sale, even though I showed them their flyer. I asked two separate salespersons and their response was "must have been a typo" and yeah, we don't discount electrolux. What a bait and switch type of operations. Too bad, I really was looking forward to spending some cash there.

We used to love this place. We were regular Sunday morning visitors. The place is named after their two sons. The oldest son was super nice and recognized us and we talked about school life etc. He went off to school and then the son steps up and acts like its a bother for you to be there. Last time and the straw on the camels back was he never said one word to us while ordering. He never made eye contact and rolled his eyes several times. When it came to paying, he just pointed at the total. Have him a credit card and then he walked away. We had guests with us and they were somebody should report him. I said he's the owners son, they don't care. So we haven't been back since.

This was my second attempt to try to get a bid from this company. Both times I had someone waiting around and they didn't show up. The first was leaving a message on the wrong telephone number. The second time today, they were supposed to come out between 11 and 2. At 155p I called and Jesse was supposed to call me with an ETA, after waiting 30 minutes for a call, I called and said just to cancel. If it was going to be this difficult just to get an estimate, I can only imagine what a poor experience it was going to be. Buyer be aware. They don't respect your time or your money. Run, don't walk, from this company.

I have been to Someburros one other time, Food was just ok. I decided to today to try their breakfast burritos. After waiting for 30 minutes they had forgotten my order and then lied and said that it takes a long time to cook chorizo. She speaks to the cooks in Spanish to make my order and then turns to me and states said that it was not her fault, then whos fault would it be? Blame it on the cooks? Avoid this place! Poor service, awful food and employees who blame others and don't even apologize when they make a mistake. Eek! Me thinks not.

We had a schedule appliance repair contracted through our home warranty company. The scheduled appointment was between 9am -noon on 06-06-2012. At 12:20 we called to see where the technician was. We were informed that he was running 30 minutes late, which would have meant that  it would be at 12:50pm. At 12:55pm,  I received a call from Sears to make sure that the refrigerator was working and to our satisfaction. I told the woman from India that no one has shown up. She stated that the ticket was closed out at 12:10pm and the service was repaired. I told her no, that wasn't the case. She put me on hold then came back on the line and said that they had attempted to call three times and left. That was a blatant lie. No one called my number.  She told me she wasn't going to argue or get in between what the tech was saying and me. I asked to talk to her supervisor. She said that they were all in meetings. I told her that I would wait. She said you can't. I asked for her name and then she hung up on me.  I called back the number and asked to speak to a supervisor. I was then placed on hold for 29 minutes. At the 29th minute, your company hung up on me. Luckily as I was calling back in, the supervisor called me.  She was apologetic and stated that the reason was we lived in a gated community. I told her yes and the tech had the gate code. She couldn't get the tech to come back out until June 12th. Another week later.  I am very disappointed that you have chosen to outsource your calls to India and have such rude people representing your company.  When I asked if the call could be listened to and have the employee spoken to, the supervisor told me that it was impossible for them to trace the call as they don't record conversations on outbound calls.  Based on my experience with Sears, I would not recommend the service company ever again to repair my appliances, nor would I recommend anyone to buy from Sears. The lack of professionalism and courtesy is clearly lacking.

I have seen this place in north Scottsdale several times. So we decided to check it out for dinner. Had the so Southern California that had  Quinoa Noodle, Chicken, Spinach, Red Pepper, Avocado, Cucumber, Feta, Mint, Balsamic Flax. Can I just say that it was so delicious! Went back for breakfast and never knew that healthy and delicious could be synonymous with eating. If you like healthy eating, this place is what you have been dreaming of. Oh and the app is a great touch if you are in a hurry.

I love the food, but the service and the customer service are bad. Five employees standing around and you have to ask for someone to help you out. Then they make the pizza and it just sits there. 30 mins in and out is a long time to wait. When complaining to the manager, the response was, oh sorry about that. Do you still want the pizza? How about you just make the pizza in a timely fashion and this rating would be a 5. Instead they never fail to disappoint. Tip--be rude like they are and insist they work at something other than a snails pace.

Avoid this company if at all possible they are rude and abrasive. They cut you off when talking. They are condescending and act like its a burden to listen. When asked to talk to manager was told too busy. Avoid like the plague!

I have asked this company to take me off their call lists as they completely damaged my car. When I ask politely to take me off they just hang up on me. Jessica was so rude, if you get a call from (928) 583-4863 Prescott, AZ. Don't answer she was a complete b@@@@@! Filing complaint with Bbb!
