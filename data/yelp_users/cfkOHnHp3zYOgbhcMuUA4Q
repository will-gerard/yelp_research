My husband and I have been going to Sekai for years. We haven't been going as often since we moved out to Tempe, but we try to stop in once a month or so. Moon, the owner, is as sweet as pie and always tells us to "Enjoy dinner!". The baked green mussels are yummy, and so is the squid salad. For sushi rolls, you can't go wrong with the Killer Roll (eel roll topped with salmon, drizzled with eel sauce) and the Phoenix Roll (Crab mix, cream cheese, salmon, and some others deep fried). If they're not on the menu, write them down on the bottom, and you'll get them. The sushi chefs are always friendly and have been more than happy to make a custom roll for me (salmon and yellowtail is pretty good, as is unagi and yellowtail). I'm probably one of the very few who adores the cheesy karaoke videos and music that play.

I went to get my right tragus pierced, and they were very nice. The piercer (I think CJ. He has his ears stretched out rather large, and I think stretched nose piercings, too.) was super nice and tolerant of my slightly-nervous perky chatter. He called me "hon" a lot, which, originally being from Texas, I totally dug. I will definitely go back to get my left tragus pierced, and whatever else I feel like getting poked.

I adore this store. The staff is insanely friendly, the yarn is beautiful and well organized, and it's in an awesome location. My only complaint is that the bike rack for the strip mall is kind of lacking, but that's not TYF's fault.

I kind of liked Kobe. The teppanyaki has always been great. The sushi is often hit or miss. I used to be a somewhat regular there, living through the meh sushi to get the good. What stopped me going there completely, besides discovering Sushi Eye not even a mile away, was an event that happened one Saturday. My husband and I were sitting at the bar like we always did when an off-duty waitress showed up with a puppy she had just purchased. Not only did she take the dog to the sushi bar, but stood right next to us at the end of the bar so the sushi chefs could pet her new pooch. The manager joined in on the doggy loving and then took her and the dog to the back, towards the kitchen. Granted, there was probably an office back there, but do you really want a dog in the kitchen where your food is being prepared? Granted, this happened at least a year or two ago, and I called the county health department, but I haven't been back since.

My husbean and I have gone here twice, and both times the food was amazing. The second time we went, the owner and his daughter both recognized us even though it had been a month or two. I always end up with leftovers for the next day, and the cilantro chutney they serve with the bread is so yummy.  The last time we went, it was rather busy, but the service was still great. Both the owner and his daughter are incredibly friendly and willing to answer whatever questions about the food you have (such as what halal means, what makes meat halal, etc). The Turkish coffee is really good, as well.
