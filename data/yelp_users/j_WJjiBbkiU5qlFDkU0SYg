AZ Mills is really worth going to only if you are: hoping to see gang members; interested in meeting a gaggle of single mothers; or really pinching your pennies.  Even though it's an outlet mall, I didn't find many "deals" here.  The prices at Gap's outlet were great, but every shirt I picked up was clearly a defect.  The V-neck sweaters looked nice, for example, except the Vs were all skewed and cut against the grain of the fabric.  Fifty percent off a piece of crap is still too pricey.  But even if you loved the low prices, you'd still have to decide whether you want to wade through this crowd.  Maybe it's the economy or just that I went at a busy time, but the mall was packed with a rather unsavory potpourri of screaming toddlers, overweight schmos with plumber's crack, semi-hardcore cholos, and mile after mile of chatty single mothers.  As others have mentioned, the bathrooms need serious attention and the crowds are prohibitive.  But I suppose if you're feeling very light in the pocketbook, you could snag some pretty foxy almost-V-neck sweaters for cheap.  Shop on.

So, it's 9:35 on a Friday and Xtreme Bean is the destination- why?  Honestly, it's only because they've got the only game in town.  That's right, America's largest public university is served by exactly 1 coffeehouse that is open to midnight.  Cartel recently pushed their ridiculous 8pm close to 10pm.  But no one else does the late night thing except Xtreme Bean.  In fact, the extended hours and generous sizes are still all I can recommend.  As ASU has grown, XB gets more and more crowded.  Good luck finding a table any night after 9pm.  Plus, all the extra people also slow the wifi to a crawl.    So why am I going?  It's coffee.  It's a place to study.  It's the only place open after 10.    Note to entrepreneurs-- want to make some money?  Open a decent 24 hour coffeehouse a few blocks away from the nation's biggest university.  Even though 60% of the student body are frat rats and future single mothers, the remainder need places to study that don't close when Mom falls asleep.

Gold Bar has a lot of potential, but disappoints me.  1.  The decor is typical "throw junk on the wall" chic.  There's a bit too much clutter and not enough seating.    2.  The prices are a bit steep.  A large mocha will cost you well over $4.00  3.  The espresso is somewhat weak.  Of the 9 or 10 places in Tempe/ASU area I've tried, Gold Bar is the worst when it comes to espresso strength.  I only knew there was coffee in my latte because it was light brown in color.  It still tastes better than Starbucks I guess and it's close to home.  But I've had much better.

Pranksters isn't the best bar in America.  It's not the best bar in Arizona.  Hell, it's barely the best bar within a 3 block radius.  But it is close to home, affordable, and I've never gotten food poisoning or skunky beer there.  In fact, I think the best thing about Pranksters is that it's not other bars.  It's not some fake Irish pub serving $8 Guinness pints.  It's not explicitly aimed at the college crowd.  It's not full of wanna-be gangbangers or middleaged Harley owners.  It's not full of the creepy plastic people from Scottsdale.  It's just a dive bar full of locals who show up for a few beers after work.  When you've had a shitty day and you don't want to brave Mill Ave, drop in to Pranksters.  Order a mini-pitcher of Kiltlifter and the Cardinal Potato Skins and thank me later.

Do you like going to the county fair?  Are you from back east?  Do you just like eating something that tastes so good that you know it's bad for you?  If you're nodding your head, you'd like Ted's.  What do you need to know about a hot dog restaurant?  Well, first you need to know what you want.  I've seen people walk in the door and immediately be asked, "what are you having sir?"  In addition to regular hotdogs, they've got footlongs, jumbo all-beef, white hots (veal & pork), bratwurst, polish sausage, italian sausage, and burgers.  You also need to know what you want on it- and this place has lots of options.  Ketchup, mustard, hot sauce (sweet and peppery), onions, relish, dill pickle spears, pickled peppers and onions, sauerkraut, chili, and nacho cheese are all available.  But the most important thing you have to know is that they ONLY TAKE CASH.  If you screw up and order food without having the green to pay for it, they might hold it for you while you run a quarter-mile across the parking lot to the ATM.  But wouldn't you rather just be part of the cool crowd who can read the giant signs on the doors that read "CASH ONLY"?

Without a doubt, one of my top 3 restaurants of all time.  Certainly the best Thai I've found in the state of Arizona.   The menu is large, diverse, though mildly pricey.  If you're looking for Thai on a ramen budget, I recommend Thai Basil on University Dr.  But if you've got $13 for an amazing Thai dinner, I suggest the Drunken Dragon noodles.  Everything I've had here has been flavorful.    A note about spicy food:  As Thai restaurants go, this one is on the hotter end.  Though I typically order my food "Thai Hot" at other restaurants, I typically stick to "Very Hot" here because it's sooo hot.  Just a note of caution :)  The service is occasionally at a slower pace than I would like, but I attribute this mostly to their crowds of customers rather than inefficiency.  Perhaps the best reason to go to Malee's for your first Thai meal?  The staff are incredibly good at keeping your water glass full- a necessity when trying those spicy entrees.

In a town littered with strip malls and chains, Carlsbad Tavern is a one-of-a-kind restaurant that blends New Mexican with middle American.  They've got a big menu and a lot of great quirky items--the green chile blue enchiladas are great, the tomatillo machaca chimichanga is heartcloggingly good, and the habenero burger is 5-alarm hot.  The service is not particularly stellar here and their drink prices are steep unless you get there for their late night (past 11pm) menu.  Still, it's a great place that's rarely crowded, the enclosed patio is nice, and the food's wild.

"One Sorority Special!"  This is what the lanky barista announced as he handed me my sugar-free vanilla latte.  His humor was, without a doubt, the best part of the Cupz experience.    The espresso ranges anywhere from average to mud, but I've never had what I would call a good drink here.  This is all the more annoying when you remember that Cupz is generally a bit *more* expensive than Starbucks.  This place remains in business for one reason:  ASU is huge and people get sick of waiting in line at Starbucks.

If you're stuck on Mill and you want some coffee really bad, they've got some really bad coffee for you.  Honestly, Coffee Plantation isn't on my top 20 best cups of coffee, but it's one of only a few places where you can get a latte near campus.  It's not very cheap and the barista range from friendly to hipper-than-thou art school drop outs.  Nonetheless, it is a coffee shop, they do make espresso drinks, and there is some good people watching to be had.  WiFi's free- you can pay to use their computers if you're technologically disadvantaged though.

Thai food can be so amazing, that it really bugs me when it's not very good.  Tonight I stopped in to Chars.  Restaurants are in the food business, not interior design, but a clean and welcoming atmosphere still makes a big difference to me.  I don't know what business used to run out of this building, but it was probably "western" themed because there are wagon wheels and longhorns adorning the walls.  As I was noticing the wagon wheels, I made the mistake of looking up.  If you're like me, you get a little discouraged when the air vents are black with dust and mold.    As far the food goes, it was not near what I would want from a decent Thai restaurant.  I ordered a spring roll (which was really an egg roll, given that it was fried and contained meat) and Pad Ka Prow with chicken.  The spring roll / egg roll arrived quickly and very hot, though it also came with super-generic "sweet and sour sauce" that didn't exactly scream authentic Thai food.  But, I'm an adventurous guy, so I stick around for the main course.  My food arrives quickly after I finish trying  the eggroll.  The Pad Ka Prow was essentially just a large-ish sized plate of chicken..pieces...in a brown garlic sauce.  Despite having asked for it to be prepared "Thai Hot" it was extraordinarily bland.  Worse yet, I experienced pain twice in a row as I found bone in two different mouthfuls of the chicken before I finally called it quits.  So if you're a big fan of thai restaurants decorated like Tombstone and you're not bothered by bone fragments in your chicken, I recommend Char's, it's cheap.

Thai Basil straddles the middle ground between Pei Wei and Malee's on Main.   The prices are probably the most memorable thing about this restaurant.  At $6.95, Thai Basil might be the cheapest Thai dinner I've had.    The food is good also.  The vegetables are fresh, the sauces and curries are powerful and tasty.  As some others have noted, the biggest problem with the food is that there's nothing to say about it.  It's not bad at all.  In fact, the Thai Basil Chicken and Spicy Noodles were both quite good.  However, they taste much like every other Thai place I've been to.  The food is good, but not a standout.  I will offer one complaint.  The restaurant is small.  Too small for the number of tables and waitstaff.  The result is a relatively cramped feeling.  Last time I ate there, my company and I were hustled out of the restaurant to make room for more patrons.

I love TJs!  They have so many great products at fair prices (not Wal-Mart cheap, but fair and much better quality foods).  Nearly everything in the store is organic or, at least, a better choice than the usual junk you find at Safeway or Fry's.  Although I suppose it's possible, you'd have to look long and hard to find high fructose corn syrup or transfats here.  What you will find is a ton of great dry goods (TJs is my trail-mix supplier), a reliable house brand, a limited variety of affordable organic produce, great frozen goods with real ingredients rather than chemicals, tons of great snacks, protein powder, vitamins and supplements, great teas (I love their Earl Grey!), and their famous affordable wines.    You'll spend more here than you would at Wal-Mart but way less than you would at Whole Foods and you'll feel a lot better.

Gross.  I love Mexican and New Mexican cuisine, but this is just the most bland, arterie-clogging mess.  I've been here three times, and each time has been as bad as the last.  Sadly, they're very close to Solo Cafe, so I've made the poor choice to eat there after a day of studying on occasion.  I always regret it.  No flavor, lots of styrofoam packaging and plastic utensils, microwaved cheese, and no spice to it.  Save your money.

Let's review your options in Tempe.  You can brave the traffic and half-human barbie cyborgs on Mill Ave for Coffee Plantation or Three Roots Cafe.  You can sit in a tiny cafe decorated by your mom's PTA board and drink watery drinks at Gold Bar.  You can rock out to AC/DC and Iron Maiden while sipping a latte at Xtreme Bean.  Or, you might stumble into Steve's Espresso.  This is not the greatest location, nor is everything absolutely perfect. But viewed in context with their competition, I've found Steve's to be the absolute best in town for a number of reasons.  1.  The coffee flavored coffee is amazing.  Steve uses french press for his coffee and the difference is tangible.  Steve's is home to the smoothest cup of coffee I've ever had.  I'd advise anyone with acid reflux or heartburn to try his java.  2.  The espresso drinks have that perfect balance of coffee and flavor.   I've personally watched the baristas (and Steve himself) throw out shots that didn't meet their standards (ie, a lot of crema).  3.  The atmosphere is great.  Urban and upscale, but not pretentious.  They keep a steady stream of eclectic and soothing music playing, and the lighting is great.    4.  You can work here.  Steve's is quiet enough to get work done.  They really seem to cater to the grad student and professional- every table along any wall is outfitted with its own powerstrip.  There are two wireless networks available- one in-house and one from Peter Piper.    5.  The prices.  A large sugar-free vanilla latte cost me $3.65.  Try that at Starbucks and you'll pay over $4, same thing at Gold Bar or Xtreme Bean.  6.  The temptations.  Try a pumpkin muffin.  I hate cinnamon as a general rule, but even I can't resist these pumpkin-pie-tasting wonders.  They're huge too.  Seriously, I crave them.  So, what's not perfect here?  I only have one gripe- the wireless is so damned slow that webpages sometimes time out.  I don't know if the neighbors are stealing access or what, but it's by far the slowest WiFi I've gotten in a Tempe coffee shop.  I ran a bandwidth test and got about 120 kbps, as compared with 800kbps at Xtreme Bean.  Nonetheless, it's free and completely unrelated to the best thing about the place- the coffee.  As a professor, I give Steve a 98 out of 100.  UPDATE:  If you went to Steve's on my recommendation of their pumpkin muffins, I am sad to report that they've cut them in half.  They still taste great, but what used to be a pretty large muffin is now slightly smaller than average.  Bummer.

In the last year, they've made a few changes that really killed this place for me.    First, their supplier of pastries must have gotten uppity with them because the size of their excellent pumpkin muffins has been halved.  And yes, the price has remained the same.  Second, they've decided to close at 8pm now.  As a student who needs a place to study until at least 10, this is totally unhelpful to me.

On my most recent visit, I chatted with the owner about two disappointing trends I've noticed at Steve's.  A few years ago, you could count on a neat little plug strip next to each table.  In addition to good coffee, glorious muffins, and burbling chilled-out house music, you could find at Steve's a good place to get your work done.  The Wi-Fi has always been spotty, but a lot of the good tables have been replaced with little cocktail tables and, worse yet, those ubiquitous plug strips are gone.  Steve explained that he's tired of people buying his coffee and studying, thereby taking up space in his store.  So in order to make more money, he's getting rid of the plugs and plans to get rid of the free wifi in the next few years.   He seemed to think this would not be a problem; I think he underestimates how many people require wifi to do their work and how little most folks care about gourmet-level coffee if it comes without a good place to do work.

So, after reading Kristin's glowing review, I decided to give this place a shot.  They're on my way home and I've had a craving for chicken fingers ever since I left Texas, where Raising Canes is huge.  Let me first talk about the good.  If you're from the south and miss Raising Canes- this place has their schtick down perfectly.  The flash-fried chicken fingers, the squishy fries, and of course, the special sause.  PSssst!  The special sauce is 50% ranch and 50% barbecue :)  But I didn't have a very good experience and it all boils down to management.  I ordered a "regular plate" which amounts to 3 chicken fingers, fries, toast, and 1 ramekin of sauce.  This amounts to about $7.00.  Did you want a drink with that?  That's another $2.  Personally, I always take water.  The counter-jockey, who very well may be the owner given his age and demeanor, informed me they were out of water cups and I would not be permitted to use one of the cups they give to those who shell out for soda.  No problem.  I was walking home, so I had my water bottle.    So, rude owner aside, we're still doing good here.  Owner appears to be the only guy in the place because he leaves the front counter, picks up his cell phone and begins calling people while preparing my order.  At no time did he A.  Thank me for my business.  B.  Wash his hands or C.  Tell me whether my food would be right out or if I should have a seat.  After about 5 minutes, owner reappears with my food and plops it down on my table.  As mentioned earlier, the food tastes pretty close to Raising Canes, so if you're looking for that ridiculously hot greasy fried-chicken + sauce thing, they've got it here.  As I think about my french fries, I realize there's no salt to be found in the whole restaurant.  I scour the booths, I check the counter, nothing.  I see the owner sitting on a chair, still on his cell phone, and wave as if to get his attention.  He waves me off as if to say, "I have no time for you" and keeps blabbing on his cell phone.    Dirty hands, no condiments, no customer service.  Three strikes, you're out.    I will not be back.

This is not a terrible place, but it's far from the best.  In fact, you can take your LA Fitness membership card and go to the much nicer newer LA Fitness on Scottsdale Road just north of the 202.    So why would you come here, where the machines are older, the trainers look a little dumpy, and the weights are fewer?    1.  Fewer crowds.  Although ASU kids do come here at night, this place is often a ghost-town in the morning.  Unlike the Scottsdale location which is stocked with the hip-replacement crowd and Stepford wives in the morning, this location is usually pretty quiet.  2.  Less pressure.  I've never been hassled or sold anything while working out here.  At other gyms, the personal trainers have a habit of approaching me while I'm working out to sell their services.  Here, they largely leave you alone.  3.  Location.  It's very close to campus and doesn't require you to drive near the increasingly congested ASU/Rural Rd/202 nexus.  Contrary to some other reviews, I've not yet encountered a signifcant amount of broken or unsafe equipment.  But this is a very basic gym; it reminds me of the weight room my high school football team had.

Fast, Efficient, Honest.  I drove in with a front-end steering problem.  Several mechanically-inclined friends suggested that I would require a new steering rack.  It was thus with great concern that I pulled my ailing car into Gene's parking lot.  Long story short: in two days, the man had my car back on the road.  Though he could easily have convinced me to pay for the new steering rack, Gene found that he could take care of my steering problem by tightening my power steering belt.  It's rare to find a mechanic who would turn down a thousand dollar job in favor of the honest answer to a customer's problem.  I'm grateful and I'll be back to him anytime my car needs work.

Every once in a while, you have an experience that reminds you of the way things are.  And you know what?  There's just no better way to clarify once and for all how disgustingly lopsided America's class system has become than a trip to Sprinkle's.    A friend from Cali just had to go here and so I was brought along.  I watched with a mixture of amusement and anger as silicone-stuffed Scottstitutes lined up one after another to pay over $3 for 5 cents worth of ingredients in a box.  I wondered, "what sort of moron pays $36 for 12 cupcakes?"  I'll answer that question for you: someone with more money than intellect.  My friend insisted I couldn't judge their decisions until I purchased one myself.  I grudgingly forked over my $3.25 for a Dark Chocolate cupcake.  With near Willy Wonka-esque inefficiency, the ladies behind the counter finally presented me with my cupcake which had been placed in a box and sealed with a sticker.  I can't imagine a more wasteful way to disburse with a single baked good.  I'm sure part of the $3.25 pays for this cardboard and sticker which will be promptly discarded by the consumer.  On to the cupcake itself.  It was good.  Not great, but good.  I'll make no excuses; it tasted nice.  The cake tasted like it should and the frosting was soft.  It tasted like something mom might have made when you were kid.  With that said, my mother would never have spent $3.25 on a cupcake.  I have no problem with paying more for considerably better food or expertise in preparation.  But you can't tell me that there's a rocket science to making cupcakes.  This is purely conspicuous consumption for people with lots of extra cash and very little going on.  How is it that in a country with more than 45 million without healthcare, the wealthy have nothing better to do with their money than the purchase of designer cupcakes?    My advice: do something better with your money.  You'll weigh less and feel better.  And if you want a cupcake, go to the store and buy the ingredients to make a dozen.  Cupcakes are not exactly tough to make.  And with the $30 or so you have left, buy some food for your local shelter or food pantry.

The In-N-Out Burger on Rural Road & 202 East is always clean, bright, and staffed with friendly kids.  Fast food places aren't known for their well-spoken and friendly teenage work force, but In-N-Out always feels a cut above.    Their menu is very simple.  You can have a double cheeseburger, a cheeseburger, or a hamburger.  They all taste great, and the fries are made while you watch.    There's also an unwritten menu at In-N-Out that has developed over the years.  If you'd like sauteed onions, pickles, and extra sauce on your burger, ask for your burger to be prepared "Animal Style".  I know it sounds goofy, but the cashier will know exactly what you mean- and it's amazing.  If you're in the mood for a burger and fries, it doesn't get much better than In-N-Out.

Though my prior complaints about their hours still stand, I've been back enough times that I felt the need to elaborate on my previous review.  First, Cartel makes what is, in my opinion, the best cappuccino in Arizona.  It's simply perfect and they serve it in the traditional size and fashion.  If you are a member of the weight-loss crowd, this one is not for you since they don't offer sugar-free syrups or skim milk.  But believe me, this one is worth the calories.  Next, you will likely have to contend with the crowd.  During the school year, Cartel stays pretty full of hipsters toting their macbooks and self-aware ironic t-shirts.  Nonetheless, I advise you to wade through the horn-rimmed glasses and men in women's jeans, at least once, and try the best cappuccino in Tempe.

Apparently I'm just learning what others already know; this place is amazing.  I'm honestly reluctant to review it just because I don't want them to become too popular.  Don't get me wrong, I hope they make plenty of money.  I just don't want to lose the perfect atmosphere they have going.  As others have said, the cafe is warm and well decorated without feeling overfull like Gold Bar.  My latte was phenomenal and the coffee they were grinding smelled amazing too.  All in all, the perfect place to get work done and feel good at the same time.

The last two times I've returned to Solo Cafe, I've brought friends.  Each of these friends have remarked that their drinks were the best coffee they'd ever had.  I have to agree that the espresso drinks are absolutely perfect.  I wish they were open later, but the quality of the drinks, the very friendly staff, and the atmosphere still makes this my favorite coffeehouse in Arizona.

Thai Elephant is another offering by the same folks who own Thai Basil, and the similarities are obvious.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and the large menu is fairly priced.  That said, I was sorely disappointed by my first trip.  First, my "Drunken Fried Rice" was identical to the spicy fried rice at Thai Basil.  I mean identical.  Disappointing in the extreme considering how good Drunken Noodles or Drunken Fried Rice can be when prepared correctly.  Second, the service was woefully inadequate.  My lunch companions arrived at 11:55 and we placed our orders at 12:05.  Our waitress disappared, not to be seen again until she brought our check.  Another waitress finally delivered our order at 12:57.  The food, though still warm was no longer hot.  It also did not rise above the level of Thai Basil's average, but not impressive, menu.  I may go back sometime, but I'll give them 6 months to figure out the whole customer service thing.

Second trip failed to impress.  The service was better this time; though practically anything under an hour wait would have been an improvement.  Unfortunately, my main gripe with Thai Elephant remains the same: they are scared of spicy food.  I ordered Pad Kee Mao and specifically asked that it be Double Thai Hot (that is, as spicy as possible).  What I received 20 minutes later was what might only be described as mild.  It was a huge disappointment.   If my friends all insist on going here again, I may tag along.  But I'll do my best to steer them to something more exciting.  Thai food for grandmas.

I think I like this place more in theory than in reality.  The idea of a great little cafe attached to a great independent bookstore is appealing.  The idea of fresh warm breads, savory soups, and light pasta dishes is even more so.  Unfortunately, this place isn't all roses in reality.  First, it is often annoyingly crowded.  So crowded that you may have to stand around waiting for someone to leave so you can sit and eat your food.  It's also not my crowd.  I'm often the only non-mom in the room.  The quality is also hit and miss.  The Lemon Garlic Penne, most of the time, is an amazing dish.  But a few times (say 3 out of 10), it's been so lemony that could barely finish it.  I also made the mistake of ordering a sandwich (I forget which one) on toasted ciabatta bread.  They sure did toast it.  I stopped after a few bites for fear that I'd lose a tooth.    However, the passion fruit iced tea is great, the soups and pastas are generally excellent.  It makes a great little place to get a bite and study, especially if you're willing to go at an off-time like 4pm rather than 6.

Despite being a red-blooded American male, I find this place a bit below average.  Yes, the waitress wander around in shorts that would make a cheerleader blush--but rail thin bottle blondes don't do anything for me or the food itself.    I've eaten here twice: the first time, I ordered huevos rancheros and coffee; today, I had the protein pancakes.  In both cases, the service was mixed and the food was bland.  My food came out quickly both times, but my server disappeared each time as well.  Today, I sat for 15 minutes until I was able to get the attention of a manger who located my server for me.   The food itself is not bad, but nothing to cheer about.  The protein pancakes were enormous and dense, but not nearly as flavorful as one expects from an item filled with almonds, blueberries, and cinnamon.  As others have noted, they'll ding you on side orders--sour cream, tomatoes, guacamole, and the like will all cost you a pretty penny for diner-quality stuff.  Finally, it doesn't affect the food, but the decor is garish and plain.  Remember that first apartment you got after college with the white walls and tan carpet?  This is basically the US Egg aesthetic.

I've now made three trips to Lobby's.  The first was an enormous disappointment, the last two have been exceptional.  On my first trip, I made the mistake of ordering the Italian beef sandwich.  What I received could best be described as a thinly-sliced beef sandwich on a baguette that some jerk spilled soup on.  My sandwich was soggy to the point of disintegration from the moment I received it.  I tend to be a very neat eater, but felt I needed a bib that day.  In addition to the mess, the whole assemblage was bland and unremarkable.    However...  I'd happily recommend Lobby's to anyone who wants a burger.  Upon hearing great things about their hamburgers, I returned to Lobby on two more occcasions.  On both days, I got a ridiculously large, juicy burger with great quality beef and fresh ingredients for a price around half of their competitors (I'm looking at you, Smashburger and Five Guys).    So, go for the burgers and read the menu carefully: the single patty burger is 1/3 pound.  If you order the double, you're ordering more than a half-pound of beef and you will need a nap.

There's no warrant for labeling these sandwiches "gourmet."  There's no fancy mustard, no snooty ingredients like fennel, orange chutney, or aubergine, and no organic/vegan/gluten-free menu.  These are just nice sandwiches made as fast as humanly possible.  I ordered and continue to order (hey, I'm a man of habit) the Italian Night Club which is, to my understanding, just every italian sounding cold cut on a bun with shredded lettuce, onion, tomatoe, mayo, oil and vinegar.  Everything's always fresh and it's not too pricey.  Good enough for me.

I received a nasty note from a user named Michael M. from Chandler for this review.  He has no reviews of his own and has bookmarked this page. Guess he's the owner or a manager? Rather than harass your customers, maybe you should try actually making decent food at a good price. The last thing PHX needs is more bad Mexican.  ---  Average to below-average mexican food at uptown prices.  I know these folks get a lot of praise for their downtown location, but the food at the Tempe location did not impress me at all.   I ordered carne asada tacos and was horrified to find a thick layer of slimy guacamole in between the meat and tortilla.  Filthy :(  I'm also not down for paying $3 for a 7 cent soft drink or paying stadium prices for a beer.    I won't be back.

Low pressure, friendly folks, and a fair price.   When my old car finally had to be replaced with something built after World War II, I found myself perusing the lots at More Mazda.  I was never harassed or pressured, and found their asking prices lower than those at CarMax and considerably lower than other Mazda dealers.  They're a much smaller dealership than most and that meant that I never felt like fresh meat being handed to sharks like I did at the mega lots in North Scottsdale.  I got the car I wanted, at a price I wanted, and one person (Tracey) helped me from start to finish.  She even worked to help me squeeze the lowest possible rate out of the lender.  If you're in the market for a Mazda, I'd definitely recommend More Mazda.

5 Star Service at a 3 Star Price.  I brought my Mazda MX-5 to Andy at Car Guys of Scottsdale to have them take care of about 7 door dings on the driver and passenger doors. $350 and 4 hours later, my roadster looks showroom new. The work looks flawless and the price was very competitive.  If I had any doubts about Andy's honesty, he advocated AGAINST some potential bodywork I'd been considering. In his opinion, the repaint would not provide a satisfactory solution for the relatively high price. Despite being in the business to make money, Andy revealed himself to be a man more interested in making his customer happy than in making a quick buck off unnecessary work. For that reason, I'll always recommend him and his business.

After hearing that this place was not only the talk of the town but also our esteemed President's favorite, I figured I'd give it a try.  Sadly, I'm not impressed.  There was nothing wrong with my dinner, but I expect a burger and fries costing $11+ to be more than just ok.  In the end though, Five Guys tastes like a neighborhood cookout.  The burger was fine--nothing unexpected, and the fries tasted homemade.    They seem to be going for a less-is-more motif in the store.  Unfortunately, it just comes off as cold and cheap--In-N-Out does the clean 50s diner look a lot better, and Smashburger does the upscale burger menu better.  It won't kill you, but you'll feel like you got overcharged.
