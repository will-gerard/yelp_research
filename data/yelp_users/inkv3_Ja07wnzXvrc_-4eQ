***GREAT PLACE FOR FRESH, LOCAL FOOD***  La Grande Orange Grocery is not your typical grocery store. Consider it to be a casual cafe-cafeteria-ish where you can order fresh baked, homemade goodies and comfort meals from breakfast, lunch and dinner. They use ingredients that are pure and natural - nothing here is made with preservatives or additives! They also have items for those who are vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free.   La Grande Orange (LGO) reminds me of Elephant's Delicatessen in Portland, OR. And if you know me, I love Elephant's Deli! So as you can imagine, I fell in love with the atmosphere at LGO. I came to visit one morning for brunch with the parentals and also met up with an old elementary school friend who lives in town. You pretty much order your food at the cash register, pay and wait by the pick-up window for your plate/orders, afterwards, you just find a seat anywhere.   The atmostphere of LGO is hustlin' and bustlin', they are quick to serve and food is made within minutes! As you can imagine, the place is quite loud, so stay tuned for your name being called as they serve your dish at the pick-up window.   FYI: They have a second location at the PHX Sky Harbor Airport (Terminal 4-D). I'm kinda glad that they have a location in the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport, so I can grab a few goodies to go on the plane and devour!  [devour] *LGO FAMOUS ENGLISH MUFFINS ($1.95/each; $9-half dozen; $16.50-dozen) Ohhh emmm gee! Their English muffins are large! Lightly toasted and sliced in half, the English muffin was served with a side of their homemade preserves and butter. You can tell this stuff is homemade by the texture as you chew into each carbalicious bite. I found out that they sell a bag of them at the airport, so I was able to grab a half dozen to share back home with my foodie friends! *highly recommended* http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#bJEjXkOfQmAZdkt106R1QA  *FAMOUS FRENCH PANCAKES ($6.75; **4 STARS**) The French pancakes were very light and fluffy! It sorta reminded me of a crepe texture. The pancake was made with honey and creme fraiche. It was topped off with several slices of fresh strawberries, which made the meal quite delightful and refreshing!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#3RCEJaMiE1A7SYjfmw-Gsw  *BIRCHERMUESLI ($5.25; **4 STARS**) Consider this breakfast dish something you can also grab on the go! (Also served at the PHX Airport!) Here you have chilled Swiss oats, mixed with raisins, slivered almonds and organic vanilla yogurt, all combine to make a healthy and fulfilling breakfast! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something to grab on the go and wants something that is healthy!  [dessert] *RED VELVET CUPCAKE (**3 STARS**) Was kinda dense. The cream cheese frosting was very thick and delightfully complimented the cupcake. I wish the cupcake had a bit more fluffiness in the cake's texture. But nonetheless, it was a decent sugar fix - but nothing to go wild and crazy about.   *SEA SALT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE (**3 STARS**) This cookie was recommended by the employees. I didn't think the cookie would be uber salty! I like salty-sweet mixtures, but there was too much salt in the cookie for me to eat. The chunks of snow-frost-like sea-salt, had to be dusted off so that the cookie was bearable to consume. I think this cookie would've been awesome if they decreased the sodium content. I did prefer this though over the red velvet cupcake.   [imbibe] *FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE  Why not get orange juice from a place that has "orange" within their name and logo! The orange juice was very refreshing and full of pulp! I wish I had ordered a larger cup of this instead of a small! They also sell this item at PHX airport so you can grab a cup of it to go! *highly recommended* http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-grande-orange-grocery-phoenix?select=N1JQGiauJS_Wgt-ozRdB2w#OWoA9xTlsGQf9iC_uN5kRw  FYI: parking can be quite limited in the front, there are spots in the back and sometimes they offer valet (no charge).  If I lived in the area, I would probably be a frequent flyer! Seriously!!! If I'm in the area again, I would try out their burgers and pizzas since that's also a popular item on their menu. If you're visiting Phoenix, definitely make a visit to LGO (or at it's airport location!) Happy travels!  Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #33

Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport's claim to fame as "America's Friendliest Airport" is something I do concur!  Upon my arrival to Phoenix, I was graciously greeted as I entered the gate of the terminal for Southwest Airlines.  They have three main Terminals 2, 3, and 4 available (not sure what happened to Terminal 1). But majority of the airlines are located at Terminals 3 and 4. I flew into Terminal 4 and it's pretty much one of the larger terminals compared to the others. In Terminal 4, their major gates are A, B, C and D.   Airlines that fly through here: Southwest, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Frontier Airlines are just to name a few.  Walking around like a lost child, I found directions from a cheerful, friendly employee who was able to help me find my way. In addition there were large directory maps to show you where to go if you were lost and also showed departures/arrivals. Using that, I was able to meet up with the parentals in Terminal C.  FYI = - Free WiFi - Tax ~9% - Many of the shops/restos are native to Phoenix (LGO, Olive & Ivy, Chelsea's Kitchen, and Barrio Cafe are just to name a few) - Golf cart drivers available to transport you around the PHX airport (from gate to gate) - Paging Assistance Locator (PAL) available to hollah at your lost ones - Car rentals are all located in the same place, you must take a shuttle to get there  Overall, I wouldn't mind flying through PHX! It's really a friendly airport and I didn't have any hassles or frills throughout my travel time here!  Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #37

One would think that there are only casinos on the Las Vegas Strip or Old Downtown Las Vegas. Guess again!!!!  There are several casinos outside these areas, but they aren't as "spectacular" in the typical "LV scene" as one might think. So all in all - not much to expect from here other than the gambling.  What has gotten worse about the casino is that it has gotten a bit "cheese-y" with the decor. It has no theme. In addition, the ventilation has gotten worse and you know how you walk into a Korean BBQ and smell like that after you've eaten there? Well once you walk through this casino for a good 5-10 minutes, your clothes will possibly smell like you've smoked a pack. Just sayin'.....................  **CONFESSION** I'm not much of a gambler. I'm even scared of loosing $1 on a slot machine! I always feel that if I'm going to spend $, I should benefit in some type of rewards wether it is in a form of retail therapy or indulging in meals. So I cannot attest to the casino level of Sunset Station nor the Hotel since I didn't stay here either. But I would imagine it would be a lot cheaper since you're not staying on the strip. You'd just pay for the commute.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ So why am I writing a review about this place if I didn't spend the night here nor contribute any losses on the slot machines?  It's because if I'm in the area (Henderson) and visiting my grandmother, we would watch movies at their Regal Theaters. I can remember watching movies here since I was in elementary school. Yes the place is a bit dim, carpet sucks, bathroom needs an upgrade, but for some things that they have improved upon are the seats in the theaters and the screens.   Overall, you won't get the razzle-dazzle-ness from the typical casino, but you can watch a movie here in peace and serenity. Just be cautious you'll smell like cigarettes after you've watched a movie........

What a NICE church!  Constructed about two years ago, All Saints Catholic Church is an amazing piece of architecture for prayer!  I came to visit extended family in Mesa, AZ and we met up at church for mass. We attended the Saturday, 4 PM mass. Usually a Catholic mass on Saturday would either be at 5 or 5:30 PM, but here it was 4 PM! Something that I wasn't quite used to.   Majority of the parishioners were of retired age. There were a few young families with babies and toddlers, but they were hardly seen in the crowds.  So how modern is this church? Well they've installed 3 projectors and screens (one for each side of the church to view during mass) for videos or presentations given during the mass. I must say, this is not typically seen in your traditional church.  Everyone here was kind and friendly. Although there is a lot of elderly parishioners, it's nice that they are very active with their community and hold fundraisers and food/clothing drives for worthy causes.   If I lived in the Mesa area, I wouldn't mind attending mass here every Sunday (or Saturday).   Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #35

The Taliesin West is Frank Lloyd Wright's "Winter Camping Home"   A MUST DO if you're visiting Arizona! A great way to admire and pay homage to one of America's Famous Architects - Frank Lloyd Wright (FLW)  [history] Frank Lloyd Wright's original Taliesin home is in Wisconsin. After one of his major projects, he had money to purchase land in Scottsdale, Arizona for only $12.50/acre back in the 1930's. Frank wanted to pass on his legacy on and so he had apprentices and mentored them in Arizona and Wisconsin. Frank had drafted the architecture for his new home, but the apprentices had built/constructed the home itself. Frank named this place Taliesin West since it was located West of his Taliesin home in Wisconsin.  [tours] INSIGHTS TOUR - 90 minutes; $32 adults (student and senior citizen discounts apply) The insights tour is one of the signature tours at Taliesin West, which gives you a glimpse of the rooms that were built. Your fees go straight to the FLW Foundation - a non-profit organization dedicated to "conserve the priceless tangible and intangible assets that are the legacy of FLW.   NOTE - there are several other tours available (i.e. night tours, group tours, etc) so you may want to check their website for the other packages that they offer. You can also rent out the area if you want to book weddings, host parties, conduct seminars, etc. (requires rezzies).  [limitations] FYI - all models, drawings, designs and works by FLW and the Taliesin Architects are exclusive property of the FLW Foundation and so therefore CANNOT be photographed, reproduced, copied, duplicated without written consent.   You may take photos throughout the tour, but your tour guide will instruct you to when that time is allowed. They are just preserving and protecting the legacy of FLW and I totally understand!  Our tour guide was very knowledgable and was able to answer questions throughout the tour. He had been a tour guide for the last 13 years! Many of the employees here know their stuff about FLW! Each tour would be different as you would get a different spin from each tour guide, but nonetheless, you'd have a wonderful experience.   FYI - *No smoking on tour *Bathrooms located in the gift shop *Parking is free *Located minutes away from Downtown Scottsdale *Beautiful view of the city and sky *75th Anniversary of Taliesin West (2012) *Correct address: 12345 N Taliesin Drive, Scottsdale, AZ 85258  If you love architecture or would like to admire one of FLW's pieces, definitely stop by Taliesin West! Highly recommended whether if you are a tourist or not!   Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #34

***This review is for the new TERMINAL 3***  It's been a LONG, LONG time (11 months) since I've flown into LAS (Las Vegas Airport) and wow, such a big upgrade has happened here! I don't even think Terminal 3 existed until recently! No wonder it took a good ten minutes for the plane to park at the terminal after landing (LOL). Upon my arrival from PDX to LAS and stepping into the new terminal, I didn't recognize where I was.   PERKS + New facility + Helpful staff (will give you directions if you're lost) + Easy to get through TSA + Ample room for seats (some handicapped seats) + Some slot machines if you want to gamble + Bathrooms are equipped for you to place your luggage in the stalls  DIRTS - Driving around can be confusing for the "passenger pick up" - make sure you read the signs if you're going to pick someone up from Terminal 1 or 3. In addition, you may have to pass through Terminal 1's passenger pick up to get to Terminal 3's passenger pick up.   Terminal 3 is quite modern and I'm glad LAS got an upgrade for this area. It's a tad of a further drive from the usual Terminal 1 (which I think needs an upgrade), but nonetheless for any domestic flights, you'll be passing through Terminal 3. It's not too shabby and wouldn't mind flying through here again!

Barrio Cafe is a great up-scale Mexican restaurant in the heart of downtown Phoenix!   Since 2002, Phoenicians (local Phoenix residents) and tourists have been flocking to Barrio Cafe to check out Wendy Gruber and Silvana S. Esparza's amazing concoctions! Cooking up authentic southern Mexican cuisine, Barrio Cafe is worth checking out if you are visiting Phoenix!  [devour] *BREAD & OLIVE TAPENADE (complimentary, **3 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#hotQFFC1GATHL5k4SK9RlA I love toasted bread and I found it interesting that there was a type of olive tapenade accompanied with this in a Mexican restaurant. I must say though, I like the concept, but I wasn't sure how it fits in with the Barrio Cafe theme and authenticity of Mexican cuisine. The olives were rich in sodium, so I needed to drink water to dilute the saltiness. Nonetheless, it was out-of-the-box, interesting, but nothing too memorable for me.  *GUACAMOLE CASERO & CHIPS ($10.50, **5 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#MeFFk_MnYU7HeBUO3kpXYg I've fallen in love with their guacamole! I'm a guacamole slut and love everything about this dish! First and foremost, who puts pomegranate seeds in their guac?! They do! This gave a bit of sweetness, which complimented the acid from your typical guacamole ingredients. Prepared table side and made in a jiffy! I was impressed with this dish and would order it again!   *COCHINITA PIBIL ($19, **5 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3TUF75Ror8SVevRy-CoaNA This dish is their FAMOUS 12-hour slow roasted pork marinated with achiote rojo (Mexican spices)! As you can imagine, the pork was quite succulent and there was a side of au jus in case you wanted more "oomph". The pork was topped off with salsa Yucateca, which elevated the flavors of the pork's richness! The dish was served with sauteed veggies and a sweet potato mash. It is a heavy dish to consume, but nonetheless, amazing dish that is taste-bud worthy! I can see why this is the popular dish amongst the visitors and regulars! Get it if you can!!! *oink*oink*    *CARNE ASADA TACOS ($14) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3NI_va9ekIdN_V8MzGYahw *FILETE AZUL (Filet Mignon) ($26) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#lsSphM27AH9f18-2r00T7A -I can't attest to the other two dishes since I did not try my fellow grubbers' dishes. But both were content with the dishes they had ordered that evening.   [imbibe] *HORCHATA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#wACvkrnyMEzHvYvvJh1iAA  Barrio Cafe was honored a couple years ago for having the most authentic horchata in town. As I had a glass of it (served in a glass Coke bottle), I was expecting the drink to be over-ly sugared! Surprisingly, it was quite tamed and it was refreshing to drink throughout my dinner here.   FYI = *No reservations - it's a first come, first serve kinda place (so expect to wait) *Closed on Mondays! *Parking on the street or nearby neighborhood lots *Nearby a random strip mall *Brunch served on Sundays only (11 AM - 3 PM) *HH Tuesdays - Fridays (3-5 PM) *They carry 250 types of TEQUILA!!!! *The restaurant's walls has plaques and awards for their food and service over the years! *If you love their food, you can find their 2nd location at PHX Sky Harbor Restaurant for their food to-go!    Service - our hostess was quite busy, she forgot to let us know how long we would have to wait to be seated. We didn't really have to wait too long (15 mins) and she apologized for the delay. Our waiter was quite attentive and was able to answer any of the questions we had about the menu. Our water glasses were filled promptly and although the restaurant was quite busy, they didn't forget anything we had requested! Thank you for your service!  Overall, I had a great experience with the Barrio Cafe and would recommend this place to someone if they are looking for an upscale kinda Mexican restaurant. I wouldn't mind coming back for their guacamole, since they put a twist to the original dish!   Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #25

I did not stay here, but I love the attractions here!  Two things to love here: - Water fountain show (which can be seen outside of the strip) - Garden of flowers   What I love about Bellagio is their garden - how they change the atmosphere every season. And every time a different décor. I love the use of the flowers and pieces. Everything is so colorful and this is what brings in the tourists and crowds.   I don't blame them! I am forever a fan!  P.S. You can ride a tram to Aria from Bellagio! (Hollah!)

One of the most extravagant casinos you'll see in Vegas!  SWANKY RESTAURANTS * Aureole (Charlie Palmer) - amazing 4-story wine tower! * Fleur (Hubert Keller) * Burger Bar (Hubert Keller) * Border Grill (Mary Sue Milliken & Susan Feniger) * RM Seafood (Rick Moonen) * Charlie Palmer Steak (voted "Best Steakhouse in Vegas") * Lupo (Wolfgang Puck) * Stripsteak (Michael Mina)  FEATURES * Shark Reef * Convention Center * Wedding Chapel * Tram is connected to travel to Luxor and Excalibur  Although I did not stay at the hotel, it's worth visiting if you're in the area! The place is pretty clean! Unfortunately I did not have time to dine at the swanky restaurants, but I know where to find them when I'm back!

Formally known as the BELTZ Outlet, the LV Premium Outlets South is quite an understatement.  The only places that they've got going for them are: - Coach - Nike - Michael Kors - Gap & Banana Republic  They've done an upgrade to the place, although the interior still needs to be worked on. There are a couple shops that I feel don't even belong as an outlet store. I feel that most of the places here are just last year's items or merchandise made specifically for outlets to sell. Like they just put a nice brand name label to unworthy quality of goods!  Like all malls, they have independent kiosk shops that sell frou frou items that nobody ends up purchasing! Pillow pets?! Hair straighteners?! Massage?!  Overall thought: Just be cautious purchasing items at outlet stores, it might be best to take your money elsewhere for decent quality than a cheap-made-for-outlet-item that will only be worth 2-3 wears before it gets worn down. I prefer the Charleston Outlets (off the 15) over this one.

SO-SO gelato in downtown Scottsdale!  I was in the area of Scottsdale's little art-walk village and needed a little snack. The Gelato Spot sounded really good for an afternoon fix and so I went to check it out with my fellow travelers. Known for their homemade gelato and many flavors, I thought this place was going to be a hit, but unfortunately it was the opposite.  Popular flavors recommended from the employees: Tiramisu*, Chocolate Caramel Brownie*, Almond Snickers and Coffee (note: * = what I ordered)  - You can order a small, medium or large.  - Prices range from $3.50-$5.50 per cup.  - If you order a medium, you can have 2 flavors in your cup.  - If you order a large, you can have 3 flavors in your cup.  - Unfortunately, only the small can have one flavor.   I ordered the a medium and tried the tiramisu and chocolate caramel brownie. The gelato was UBER sugary! I thought gelato was a bit too much in sugar and not enough in the flavor. I sorta kinda tasted a banana flavor in my tiramisu gelato. Not sure if the spoon that was used to scoop my flavor was mixed up with another. The chocolate caramel brownie was rich, but was probably a better choice than the tiramisu. Topped with a triangle cut piece of waffle cone and a cylinder chocolate swirl cookie, you can imagine this is sugar overload!  I did have a chance to sample my grubber's coffee, almond snickers and pistachio flavors. I thought the coffee was the best out of all the flavors I had tried.   Service was decent. No complaints there. It's nice that you were able to sample the different flavors prior to you making a final decision.   Parking is within the downtown Scottsdale Art Village area.  Not sure if I'd come back to this gelato spot. And to be honest, I've had better. I do have a sweet tooth, but unfortunately I was not impressed by the over-sweet gelato that was offered. I may have ordered the wrong flavors, but not sure if it's compelling enough for me to come back and re-challenge other items on their menu. I do hope that in the future - they don't make the gelato as sugary as I had during my visit.   Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #26

I am a fan of Thomas Keller. And I also have a thing for French Macarons! Enter Buchon Bakery of Las Vegas, NV.  Located in the casino level of the Venetian (under the escalators). You can find this one-stop shop infamous for their coffee, cakes and other carb-a-licious sweet goodies!  What did I try? - BOUCHON = the French term "bouchon," in English means "cork stopper" or "cork in the mouth of a wine bottle". In this case their "bouchon" was in the shape of a cork but in a cupcake form since it was a mini-brownie! This was VERY delightful! (emphasis on the VERY) In fact, the bouchon was soft and moist, chocolate-y, yet not over-powering. There was a touch of powdered sugar and for ($2) for one of these, you better savor the scrumptiousness! It was very heavenly!  - FRENCH MACARONS = I bought the to-go set (for $17.50), which includes all 6 flavors of their French macarons. They have chocolate, espresso, pistachio, strawberry, lemon and vanilla. ESPRESSO was my favorite out of all of them!  - CROISSANT = simple, buttery, flaky and couldn't stop myself from eating this! Caution for some of those buttery flakes falling upon your self! Word of advice: don't leave the evidence laying around!  - BREAD PUDDING = was very delightful! Filled with some custard, cinnamon, raisins and apples, this dish was very well put together! If you left me alone with this, it can be quite dangerous! I'm glad I shared!  - VEGGIE BREAD = made with fresh tomatoes and greens. It also had olives, pinenuts and delicious cheese! It tastes even better when TOASTED! (FYI = if toasted, expect to wait 3-4 minutes for it to be complete). But overall, even though I'm not vegetarian, I'd opt for this again!  Overall thought? Awesome with a capital "A"!!! I was a carb-fix so I did not sample the coffee. But there were lines of people who were ordering the stuff! Service was quick and it was nice that they were able to toast the veggie bread! The next time I visit here I'll be sampling the cup of joe with an espresso-flavored French macaron! Until next time my sweet, carb-a-licious bakery, I am forever a fan!

I like shopping here since they have a great selection of OBEY clothing.   Zumiez caters to those who love to skate, snowboard or surf. If you're looking for gear, they probably carry it! They are also big on the fashion that intertwines with these extreme sports.   Brands you'll find here =  OBEY, LRG, RVCA, VOLCOM, DaKine, Toms, DC, Neff, Vans, Nike, Element, Fox, Nixon, G-shock, Converse, Emerica, Fallen, Roxy, STUSSY, Billabong, Hurley and O'Neill (just to name a few)  This location not only has the items I am looking for, but the customer service is great! The employees are very cool and were able to help me with everything I needed! I'd recommend this place if you are looking for any of the brands I mentioned earlier!  If in dire need of an item, I'll be sure to look here!

This H&M location is nice that you don't have to go thru a casino to get to the store. Located in the Town Square outdoor mall, near Old Navy and the Rave movie theaters.  H&M in general is = Fashion forward, yet can be classic Affordable yet if you stay here too long you'll hurt your wallet Messy, but sometimes when I'm here it can be clean (depends if it's a busy weekend).  Can't find a present? Get a giftcard!   I'll forever be a fan!

Glad this place exists!  I like that this place is very accessible and you don't have to worry too much of the chaotic traffic from the strip.   FYI = I suggest going here after you've done some shopping at the outlet stores in the LV area.   Below are a short list of places you can go to: EATS: Lollicup, Chipotle, Claim Jumper, Kabuki, Yogurtland, Alehouse, CPK, i love burgers, Teavana, Yardhouse, Wholefoods   SHOPS: A&F, Origins, Crocs, H&M, Old Navy, Bath & Bodyworks, Clarks, Sephora, Express, Victoria's Secret, Sanrio, Banana Republic, GAP, American Eagle, Bebe, Guess, J. Crew, Apple store, Armani Exchange, Zumiez, Hot Topic, Hollister, ALDO, Chicos, Aeropostle, Ann Taylor, Puma, Fry's Electronics, MAC, Oakley, Steve Madden, Staples  LEISURE: Rave Theater Entertainment (movie theaters)  Overall: great selection of stores and probably better quality (since outlet stores have degraded their use of material - in regards to clothing). I'd be back if I need some retail therapy!

After being in Portland for quite some time, I've been craving for the good ol' In-N-Out Burger!  I convinced my grandma to make a pit-stop here for my usual: #2 with grilled onions + fries + strawberry shake = happy tummy!  Service here was quite superb! Friendly, fast and no frills! This location is very close to the 215 freeway, so you can't miss it!   Thanks, In-N-Out for satisfying my cravings!

The name says it ALL!  PERKS + Fresh produce items + Easy made meals which are also healthy + Marked down items occur daily! (Can be dirt cheap!) + Friendly employees + Rewards program  DIRTS - Self-serve check out  - Bag your own groceries  Back when Fresh and Easy started opening up in the country, this was one of the first locations I went to. My grandma lives in Henderson, so whenever I visit, I definitely stop by here to grab some goodies for her!

Like this place needs another review!!! (I THINK SO!!!!)  For $30+/per person for either BLD, I think it's worth it! Vegas is all about their buffets and extravagance - Studio B is probably the epitome of both! I heard lines can form and people wait for hours just dying to eat here on the weekends. BUT!!!!! If you just come a little bit earlier (which is why the early bird gets the worm), you'd be able to not wait as long and just chow down as you intended to.  I came here for my grandmother's 75th birthday. My fam bam took her out to brunch. Service was awesome and the food was grastronomical!   Food that they cater to: Mediterranean/Lebanese, Japanese, Hawaiian, Filipino, American, Southern, Mongolian, Italian, Chinese, Seafood (FRESHLY STEAMED KING CRAB LEGS & OYSTERS!!!), Mexican, Indian and the desserts!  Memorable foods I'd love to eat HERE again: - Hawaiian Poke  - Hawaiian Lau lau - Caprese Salad - Ribs - Sweet Potatoes - King crab legs - Oysters  [SODIUM WARNING] I took off one star due to the HIGH salty taste of their LOBSTER BISQUE SOUP. It sounds amazing, but just tasting the darn thing reeked sodium overload! I couldn't finish the bowl I had poured for myself and hated that such great food went to waste [**insert sad face here**]  DESSERTS: I enjoyed all of their mini dessert shooters! Pistachio, Tiramisu, Cookies N' Creme are just to name a few...... Not to mention their gelato, yummy cakes, cookies and other decadent delightfuls! Desserts weren't over-powering sweet! Just right to end your meal extravaganza at Studio B!  Overall thought? I will definitely come back to Studio B when I'm back in the neighborhood! Great service, great food (minus the lobster bisque) and come hungry (and early) to get your moolah's worth!  Next time: I'm going to tackle the "unlimited wine" I heard about!

BEST HOTEL OFF THE STRIP!!!! (Sorry I didn't stay here, but was a tourist checking the place out!)  Consider the M Resort as a mirage you see on those cartoons, and when you get there they don't exist..... well in reality (not in cartoon-world), this place DOES exist and is quite impeccable!  Shoot! I didn't know this place existed! It's been about 2-3 years since I last visited my grandma in Vegas! And all this time I heard her talk about this place, I thought it was off the strip! BUT, it's so close to Henderson where my grandmother lives that it's nice that I don't have to deal with the traffic on LV Blvd. This is quite a swanky place! From the bathrooms to the casino - this place went all out with their upscale décor.   If this place isn't panty-dropping it for you...... maybe check out their buffet to consider otherwise!  I'll leave it at that!

Location: Town Square Mall (an outdoor mall)  If I ever need some make-up, Sephora never fails! Especially this location since you don't have to worry about going through the casinos shopping mall and long walk from the parking structure just to get to the store!  Excellent customer service - very friendly and were not shy about giving you samples! [***insert happy face here***]  This location always has something that I need! Other locations always seem to have run out! Eeeek!  Overall - I'll be back!   P.S. - Sign up for their Beauty Insider Rewards program (it's free and you get free samples on your birthday!)

What an amazing convention center!!!!  PERKS + Ample parking + Bus routes available for those attending the convention center + Taxis and limos available outside as well + Friendly employees to assist you to the right direction + Bathrooms are kept clean!  DIRTS - Overpriced food at the food-court - Need more seating area for those hanging around the convention center - Be prepared for lots of walking! (Bring comfy shoes!) - Taxi and limo drivers can be kinda reckless!  FYI = * Nearby hotels: You can stay either at Excalibur, Luxor or Mandalay Bay * Tram from Excalibur & Luxor connects to Mandalay Bay so you can just walk towards the convention center (~10-15 minutes travel time) * Wedding chapel and Shark reef attraction is in the same area as the convention center * Border Grill is walking distance towards the casino if you're looking for a better bite to eat than at the food court!

This is not your typical Catholic Church!  Consider St. Sharbel as an Eastern Catholic Church, where there are still main components as the Roman Catholic Church, the only difference is that the language that is used in some of the responses are in Aramaic (Jesus' language).  My grandma brought me here, as she has been visiting this church since Easter. She loves the sermons and the fact that this parish uses Aramaic within their masses. The church is nestled within a neighborhood, where there is still development going on. The hall is quite large, while the church is somewhat in transition as it is just a huge bungalow (the parish is raising money to build a nice church). But the decor of the church-bungalow was not your typical Roman Catholic design. The stone work reminded my grandmother of Jerusalem (where she happened to travel back in the day for a pilgrimage), while the use of incense was abundant throughout the mass. Most of the parishioners were Filipino, Italian, Lebanese, Hispanic and Indian.   It was my first Aramaic-English mass that I've ever attended. I liked how there was a flat screen so you can read-along to what the readings and the responses were. Overall, if I lived in the area, I wouldn't mind attending mass here as it is quite different than your traditional Roman Catholic churches!

Renting here wasn't that bad. I know a lot of the previous reviews may seem a bit bad, but maybe they have improved(?).   Anyways, my family and I rented a Hyundai Elantra (silver) 4 door automatic sedan for a few days during our visit to Arizona. I must say though after driving around in the city, there are several Elantra's! I'm so used to seeing Subaru's in Portland and BMW's/Lexus's in L.A.  For a 5 day rental, we only paid about $240-ish (in cash). It was nice that the rental area was combined in the same building as all the other car rental companies and also had shuttles to bring you to Sky Harbor Airport.   If you are able to find a deal with this company (I believe there are coupons online), it's not too shabby. No complaints here!   Yelp 2013 100 for 100 Challenge - Review #36
