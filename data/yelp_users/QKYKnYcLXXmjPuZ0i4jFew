Heck with the bill, Fork is awesome!    Our table had salmon and trout, and all were extraordinary. I think sometimes fish has to be fried or heavily seasoned to be super tasty.  I make blackened fish at home with my own seasoning recipe, and it's a wonder there's anything recognizable under all those herbs.  Fork accomplished the opposite--huge wonderful flavor and taste without frying or overwhelming the trout.    Plus they put a single perfectly HUGE ice cube in my whiskey. What is nom nom for whiskey? Until I figure that out, "I'll have another" will have to suffice.

Nowhere can you find outlets to charge phones or tablets!!  What's up with that?  This place is 15 years behind in making improvements that passengers need and want. I found one "charging station" that made it look like they were doing us a favor by providing a dozen outlets in one very small area. It's still fun to come here, but abandon hope ye who are low on battery life.

Fire on tall obelisks, booze around a big pool, and the word "spa" in there somewhere. Add the heat of a Scottsdale evening and you have Firesky. Signora approved.    The lobby and pool grounds are first class. Yeah they have some rough edges; it's an aging facility. But their staff is great, and the spa (out of my budget) seems truly glorious. Our fridge was warm on our arrival, and a cheerful fellow brought another one straight away. We wanted to rent a cabana for the day, but the price ($150) seemed a little steep, at least when the resort is not busy. When it's packed, I bet it's a good deal. You could hide behind the cabana curtains and tell the rabble, "keep  your distance!" Then to the pool-side waitstaff, "another mojito if you please." That's livin'.

Cartel is exceptional! Notwithstanding diminished expectations because of its location by the gate in an airport.   The instrument of choice for espresso consumers is, naturally, La Marzocco, the Sophia Loren of espresso machines. CCL's version is a 3-port "Strada." Sleek, tight, stunning, lovely. The espresso is complex and bold, and served on a wooden board with a cup of water and a spoon. I liked the accessories but the espresso alone is Whoohoo.  Provided you don't get it in a paper cup. Not allowed.
