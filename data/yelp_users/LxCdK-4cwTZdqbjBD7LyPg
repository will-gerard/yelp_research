I moved to North Scottsdale a little over a year ago and have been in search of a local bar, I finally found this place on Yelp probably 2 or 3 weeks earlier. I had been meaning to come in and check it out. Went in on a Sunday evening and I asked my waitress what she recommends eating since it's my first time in the establishment. She recommended I get the chili relleno, which was amazing. Then we went back on the following Tuesday, sat at the same table and got the same waitress who was awesome, she remembered the drinks we ordered from Sunday night and was kind and wrote down the daily specials for us. We went back last Sunday but earlier in the day and again had another great waitress, the waitress who normally helps us came in and had lunch with her family before starting her shift and she came to chat with us for a few minutes. I'm sad I didn't find Arena Sports Grill sooner, it's a great local area bar and on nights we just want to go out and grab a cocktail or beer we stop by.

Jorge sold me my car. He's the best. Whenever I have someone looking for a car, I give them Jorge's number. I bought my car a few years ago, I went in with an intent to get an import, Jorge worked with me to find one, the moment I saw the car, I knew I had to have it. Every year on my cars "anniversary," I get a phone call from him checking on things and wishing me well. Whenever I get my car serviced, and he's there, he comes and checks to make sure my car is still up to my standards. I must say, I will only buy my vehicles from Jorge. Superior service years after my purchase, I don't think it could be any better.

My most favorite place when I go to Old Town Scottsdale. I have been coming here for years. This place never lets me down. The bartenders and staff are awesome and super friendly. I have even come here a few times during the day and the food is delicious too. I always have a great time when I go to DJ's of Scottsdale.

I use to come here all the time but then I moved out of the area. It has been a few years since I've been back. But I happen to be in the area and in need of a pedicure. This place is not like it use to be. I walked in and had to wait five minutes before the receptionist discovered I was there. Even clients were looking at me and trying to track down the receptionist. After I finally got helped I was instructed to pick a color out then she just kind of pointed in a direction and told me to go sit over there. After I sat down, I had to wait another five minutes and was told by three nail techs that someone will be right with me. Then someone finally came to help me and she took out what looked like an oversized shower cap to put into the foot spa to fill up the water!!! I had never seen this before. Of course she gave me the list of options I can get with my pedicure and they charge for everything. From what I hear this place has changed hands so many times. It isn't what it use to be. I know I won't be back.

I like to try new places out every now and then. I was in search of a breakfast place and stumbled upon this hidden gem. I discovered coming in early afternoon is the best time to come by. You get seated right away and can find good parking. I had the Southwest Country Fried steak it was delicious. I love eating country fried steak and I love green chili and this plate brought the two together. We also found the place with the best and most amazing biscuits and gravy.

This place is great! Went here for a birthday dinner. I just made a reservation and in the reservation I stated that it was a birthday celebration and to make it special. So when we arrived, the table was decorated with happy birthday confetti. We had Allie, she was so sweet and attentive. The food arrived promptly and was so delicious. The dessert was great. All around, I cannot wait to come back here.

I came here for the first time over the weekend. I have been to several bars/lounges/clubs as my drinking years go on. However when I went to Shotgun Betty's for the first time ever I was asked by security if I had another form of ID other than my drivers license. I have never been refused entry for not having 2 forms of ID. After this experience I will not be returning

Been here a few times. After hearing about the rooftop dining, I decided the next time I came here I would try to get the poolside table. So this past weekend we decided to come here and just as my request they seated me next to the pool. The service here has never let me down. The food has always been amazing. It was just so beautiful being able to see the clouds and stars while eating. The rooftop has a different ambiance more quiet and intimate. I cannot wait to come back again!

I have been wanting to try this place since I drove by...then recently for my splurge meal during Arizona Restaurant Week, we decided to try Bootleggers. I made a reservation and was seated promptly in the private dining room. It was actually a surprise to me that I was able to be seated so quickly, I went in with the expectation I would be waiting approximately 10 minutes or so just because it was AZRW. The service was decent, I could tell the server was just overwhelmed. He did as best as he could. When our food came out, there was a minor issue, with the fries but we addressed it with the food runner and he came back with the correct fries within 5 minutes. We ordered a sampler for 2 and it came with tortilla. I am not a huge fan of ribs and I demolished the ribs on the platter. By the end of the meal, our waiter was apologetic about not being able to spend more time with us because he has been running around nonstop since he started his shift. He did make some recommendations on what we need to order for next time. Yes we will be coming back next time.

This place is amazing. A great local spot. I tried just the Lucky Dog and it was top notch. I also got the loaded fry masterpiece and it was to die for. The owner was so nice and friendly he greeted us, checked on us to be sure the food was to our standards and even shared the ingredients with us. I think it's great that he chose to use the healthy options. I was so excited to hear that they had Thrifty Ice Cream. I live down the street from here, I can't wait to go back for more food.

We came here twice. The first time we sat in the back and last night since a storm was coming in we sat inside. Had the same waiter, he remembered us from the first time and he even remembered what we ordered and where we sat. We found this place one night when we were driving home from a night out. It's a cute restaurant. Love the outdoor seating. The service is just top notch. I recommend this place to anyone who will ask me. Both times I got the fried chicken with the ssrriranch and it was amazing!!

Drove past this place a few weeks ago and took a mental note. Had a taste for pizza tonight and decided to order. BEST decision EVERRR!!!! The pizza was great. I like that it wasn't very heavy in my stomach if that makes sense (lol). I was also able to try some wings. I decided to order golden medium bone in and they were just as amazing. There was just one minor issue I had, the pizza slices could have been cut better but that is such a minor detail, it didn't affect the taste or quality. The staff was great, everyone was friendly. I was able to be helped promptly. I have found my new go to place for pizza. I can't wait to try other menu items and even dessert next time
