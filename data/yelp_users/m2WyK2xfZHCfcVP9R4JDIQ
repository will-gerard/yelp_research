The staff here is very nice there is just never enough of them. This is not a single occurrence. I was third in line this morning and from the time I walked in until I walked out it was 13 minutes.

OK, the vibe at this place is pretty cool. They have done a fantastic job of creating an outside dining space. However, the organization leaves a lot to be desired. We waited in a looooong line. One one person taking orders, really.....they even have two windows. In addition to the long line the two people in front of us kept welcoming their friends into line with them - all eight of them. Wait time in line - 30 minutes. Now interacting with the staff there was pleasant so I do not want to take anything away from them, it really is just the organization that needs work.   If you are hoping to find something healthy you are going to have limited choices. Pretty much fried everything and some salads. The food gets three stars but the items above and the cost take it down to two. All in all an interesting experience that is worth the trip, just needs some tweaking to get them across the finish line.

OK, the restaurant experience is only as good as its weakest link. This lovely little place has great food. However there are two big issues. First, the service has to be good. We got caught in the shift change. Our 1st waiter was fine but our second waitress seemed to care less we were there. Second issue, $2.75 for an ice tea (brewed), and $2 for a refill, give me a break. As sort of icing on the cake, the waitress (yes, the one that didn't really care we were there) simply brought us our check when we finished lunch. We asked her, "hey don't you guys have pastries here?" Never had to ask for desert at a pastry place.   All in all a nice place to eat but they need to focus on getting the little things right to earn those five stars.

What a wonderful place to dine. My wife and I were looking for someplace new to grab a bite to eat. Mazie's is a short 10 minute walk from our home so we decided to give it a try - especially since the heat here in Phoenix has subsided.   First and foremost the service is excellent. We were greeted with smiles at the door and delight in answering our questions about the establishment. OK, it's a restaurant so food is important. We found the menu quite delightful and peppered with a few surprises. You have to give the buffalo blue cheese appetizer a try - it was wonderful. We were delighted with the rest of our meal as well, especially the $35 bottle of Spanish Tempranillo.   Desert, yes desert, was wonderful. We had their version of Strwaberry Shortcake. Well it's Sunday morning at noon and I am still full from our wonderful dinner.   One of the best parts of the meal was when Mazie herself cam over to talk to us. Her excitement for what she is creating was contagious. We certainly wish her luck with this gem of a restaurant.   In short the food is great, the service is wonderful,  Mazie is a proud owner and you can't go wrong with the very reasonable prices. Now get yourself to Mazie's and get ready for a wonderful/refreshing experience.   PS - Ask for Cha Cha, what a great waitress!

Over the years we have enjoyed our experience at Total Wine. However, as of recent the customer service has deteriorated quite a bit. Customer service failure #1. We reserved two kegs for a wedding this weekend and when we arrived to pick them up the lady said she did not have a reservation for us, and she was kind of snooty about it. After looking in the back they had both kegs with a big sheet of paper with our names on them. Customer service failure #2, no apology for being snooty. Both of the taps for the kegs had issues. One would not hold pressure at all and the other required us to pump like crazy. When we returned the kegs I mentioned it to the gentleman at the service desk, more just so he would know. Customer service failure #3, he grunted at me (yes, I said grunted) and handed my deposit receipt back to me he then told me "go to the cashier". I sure felt like I was an inconvenience to him.   These guys have a great model and we enjoy purchasing from them. However, if the customer service does not improve we will certainly take our dollars where they are more appreciated.

V's is a pretty good barber shop. I get my hair cut here frequently and they do a great job. With that said I am often frustrated at their initial customer service when you walk in. I am never greeted and if there is a queue of people they do not take your name down or give you an indication of how long the wait is. This is particularly problematic when there are a number of scheduled appointments.   A great haircut is only half of the experience. You have to make the customer feel valued from the time they arrive until they leave. If the guy that is doing the cleanup would pay attention to incoming customers instead of talking to the barbers that would be a start.

I have been eating at the many locations of the Good Egg Egg for years. The food is great and the service is exceptional. The only item that needs some work here is their coffee. It would be wonderful to have some options for lattes, cappuccinos, or flat whites. The coffee they serve is weak and not much flavor. There really is nothing better than a good cup of coffee with your breakfast. Keep up the great work and add some awesome coffee and this place will be perfect.

The worst hospital care I have ever observed. My wife had to be taken here after she developed severe abdominal pain on a flight to Phoenix.   The ER team was nice but quite unorganized. It took them 5 hours to transfer her out of ER and admitted to the hospital. After another seven hours the team on the floor still did not have her test results from ER. But they sure as Hell made it a priority to get her gall bladder surgery scheduled for the afternoon - yes, without the test results. We insisted on being discharged (which took another three hours) and moved to another hospital.

The staff at the store is very friendly but they are severely understaffed. I was second in line and it has been an hour. AT&T should really pay attention to this, the have been the customers that walked out thus far. Not sure what that is worth but lost customers are hard to replace.

Bad Attitude - Well, that about sums it up. I moved out to the north valley in July of last year and thus far have spent $1900 at this shop. On two occasions I have had to deal with attitude from one of the bike mechanics there - big guy with the beard. I took my road bike in today to ask a question and the condescending mechanic only made fun of how old my bike is - yep, it's a vintage 2003 model. Not the best bike in the world but it has been a great ride for 11 years.  He also felt compelled to tell me "you really need a new bike but don't worry it won't make you any faster". Here's the kicker, I did a race last weekend and decided I was going to upgrade before my next one in September. Sorry Bicycle Vibe, I'll be taking the $4K I have for my new purchase elsewhere.   Why do people have to talk down to others? Did that really make him feel better? Not only did he have a chance to make a great sell and win a customer, he had a chance to be nice to another human being. Does it really matter how old your bike is? It would be so cool to have a nice bike shop here up north, without the attitude.  13 April 2015 Update - I found a great new bike shop in the North Valley. If you are looking for great customer service and a knowledgable staff checkout Sonoran Cycles at 38th Ave & Happy Valley Road. I had a great experience there today.

Boo!!! We had a pretty good experience until we went to checkout. The coupons we printed off of their website TODAY were expire and they would not honor them. Update your damn website!

Came here tonight since my wife is traveling to see what the place is like. I really wanted to like this place, very close to my house. I would like to echo that the service and people are fantastic. However, the food is a 4 on a 10 scale. The Generals's chicken was heavily breaded, made of chicken parts and very salty. I am a bit of a health nut so I was hoping for more white chicken than bread. Fried rice was nice and so was the hot and sour soup. Would be nice to have some healthy options on the menu. I would pay an up charge for chicken breast not breaded.

If you are going here make sure to make an appointment, it will make your wait far less. I had an 8a appointment and was out by 8:11a. The staff was very helpful.  If the team at Sonora reads this just a simple recommendation, open the door a few minutes early. A couple of elderly people arrived early and did not have a place to sit. Would be nice if they could go in and register early and sit in the waiting room.

I absolutely love this place. The food is fantastic and the staff is very kind. Everything is fresh and prepared to order. The only minus is the music is too loud and the speakers are so sharp, which is not a good combination (my rating would be 5 stars if the environment was more enjoyable But don't let that stop you from enjoying some excellent food.

My wife and I had a nice lunch sandwich here today. Some of the reviews indicated the sandwiches are too small and not good value. In my opinion the are the perfect size and the price quite reasonable. Our supersize world seems to demand twice as much as we need during a meal.   They are still pretty new so their staff is coming up to speed. Everyone was very friendly and our orders were prepared in a timely manner. They could really use better design of the space inside to create more seating and give the atmosphere a better vibe.   I am sure to be back and look forward to rewarding that 5th star as they iron out the kinks.

We eat at Chelsea's Kitchen all the time and love it. Wish I could say the same for their location here at Sky Harbor. After a dozen or so meals here I can give you a pretty good idea of what to expect.   The location is great, terminal 4 outside of security between the A & B concourse. Very nice design and comfortable.   Unfortunately that is about where things go south. The service is abysmal, it takes forever to get your food and more often than not the food is cold. This morning I ordered a hot breakfast sandwich which came out room temp and the turkey was refrigerator cold. The one bright side is our waiter was very attentive today.   So let's talk about the caliber of service. Who trains these people? The hostess practically ignored us indicating that when the other lady returned she would seat us. Hello, the place was dead, show some initiative and seat a customer. First impressions really do matter. After waiting a minute the lady who did seat us didn't say a word or make eye contact. Hello again, customer service rule, make guests feel like you want them in your establishment.   Whoever trains the people at the airport gets an F as the experience in no way resembles what you get at the 40th street location.   If I were Chelsea's I would be concerned that the additional revenue would not be worth a tarnished reputation.

OK - I have been very sad since Franco pulled out of the Esplanade and moved his cuisine to NYC. I found out yesterday he was back and my wife I and I promptly went there for dinner last night.   The service was great, food exceptional and as you might expect Franco was there a working the restaurant with his passion for customer service to create a wonderful dining experience.   It was such a delight to order a meal that was very tasty and well portioned. The wine list is also fantastic. They have $20 bottles that go great with an Italian meal as well as some pricier bottles if you are so inclined.   Franco, we are glad to have you back!

Wow! So the folks who run TSA think the best think to do is shut down TSAPre because they do not have enough staff. Tell me what the hell about that makes sense. Hey let's shut down the line that moves people through the fastest. I would honestly rather take my chances with the old system. TSA is incompetent and has no idea what they are doing.

I cannot tell you how much I want this place to be good.  With that said they have some serious work to do. My wife and I are admitted foodies and as a result have some relatively high standards for food and service.   We had dinner here and to put it honestly it was very disappointing. To start, our waitress knew nothing about the wines on the menu. After about three questions she asked us to wait a minute and came back with the bartender. He was great and explained exactly what they had. I will say their wine list needs some serious work. After our wine was served I was talking to the waitress about how she could learn more about wine, she proceeded to tell us she did not plan on being there that long and was not sure she needed to learn anything else about wine.   Strike two, we ordered our starter salad and entree - yep, you guessed it, it all arrived at the same time. My wife mentioned we would have liked our salads first - her reply, well you should have told me that. I am sorry, you are a server, your job is to know how to serve food, one course at a time.   Strike three, our medium rare bison burger came out as regular beef well done.  If Tru plans on making it in this market they need to dramatically improve their service, food and attention to detail. If you guys want to know what I am taking about take a trip to Hillstone or Houstons and order a burger. The service is impeccable and the food cooked perfectly. I certainly hope you guys can make it happen. We really need some good dining in the Anthem area.

Our server was fabulous. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for the two cocktails my wife and I ordered. Her margarita was undrinkable and my mango margarita tasted like sunny delight. I would advise to not drink here and based upon the other reviews eating here sounds just as bad. Just a quick add here. The two margaritas were $26. WTF?
