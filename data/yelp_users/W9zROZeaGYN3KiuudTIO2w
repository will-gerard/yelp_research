Service 5/5 Staff was awesome...Friendly, quick, & attentive! They doted over our baby too so that helped!  Food 4/5 Food was honestly pretty darn good! I had the Eggs Benedict w/ hashbrowns. The baby had Scrambled Eggs & the French Toast. 4/5 because the french toast was dry & maybe a smidge over cooked.   Ambiance 4/5 Really small & tight squeeze! But everyone (including the patrons) were super kind & friendly...like a family!  Overall Experience 5/5 It was an awesome experience!   Total 4.5/5 (I'm gonna truncate (round up) to 5 Stars because Yelp doesn't do half points.)  Bottom Line... I'd definitely go back & I'd definitely recommend to a friend!

I ordered 2 eggs over medium hashbrowns & the Griddle Cakes. My husband had the Classic Reuben.   SERVICE - 2 stars - Waitresses were rude. And were transparently erked when we asked for Non Dairy Creamer. TASTE - 4 stars - Food was really good. But my eggs were over easy not over medium, the way I ordered them.  VALUE - 1 star - they give you 2oz of syrup for an entire order of Griddle Cakes... then charge you $1.50 for every 2oz of extra syrup you order. My husbands Reuben had hardly any meat on it.   OVERAll - 2.3 ... Taste was excellent but service and bang for my buck did not meet, even my most minimum of stanfards.  BOTTOM LINE Will I be going back?... probably not.  Will I recommend to a friend... NO!

Love This Place!  Food 4/5 - I had the Eggs Benedict with pancakes. I think the Hollandaise is a mix but other than that it was great!  Eggs cooked just right & cakes were delicious.  Service 4/5 - Servers are always very nice but they can never get my order right...   Value 4/5 - Pretty affordable for a family of 5!  Overall 4/5 - Love this place!  Will I be back? Yup!  Would I recommend to a friend? Yup... with the caveat "Just be patient with the waitstaff!"

BEST BURGER IN THE WORLD! THE WORLD! Jesus himself would have loved this burger! Awesome service. Awesome music. About this time of year I usually get super fed up with X-mas music. So theydefinitelyget extra points in my book for that!

What a fabulous restaurant! I can't believe we did not come here sooner. We were greeted when we walked in by a smiling hostess who was very pleasant. We sat in one of the cute little booths that was next to the Vespa oyster bar. What a great idea for an oyster bar! Gino, our server was very charming as well as knowledgeable about the food and wine. His recommendations were right on. I had the incredible Filet of sole Puttanesca and my friend had the Pappardele pasta with some rapini saut√©ed with fresh garlic and extra virgin olive oil. We shared a bottle Gino recommended of a delicious chianti riserva. It paired perfectly with both dishes. Dessert was an incredible molten salted caramel torte, double espressos with some sambuca that again was suggested by our server. What a finish to a fabulous meal! Food- 5 Ambiance- 4 Service-5 Overall - 5

Food - 5/5 Stars - I had the Lump Crab Eggs Benedict & the Nutella & Banana French toast. Hands down THE BEST EGGS BENNY I've had in a long time! French Toast was just decadent! Oh, & the nectur of the Gods they serve with it (home made maple syrup) is something straight from heaven. Our meal was pretty much perfect!  Service - 5/5 Stars - Wait staff was attentive & worked well together. We didn't have to hardly ask for anything. They were on it! Ask for Jesus, he was great. Very knowledgeable and friendly.    Ambiance - 5 / 5 Stars - Awesome! Witty sayings & quotes on the wall (in a chalk mural style)! Love it! Bloody Mary Bar was a nice touch, too!  Value - 5 / 5 Stars - Inexpensive for the whole family.   Overall 5 Stars   Will I be back? Yes Would I recommend to a friend? Yes
