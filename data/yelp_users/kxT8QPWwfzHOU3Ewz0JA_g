My girlfriend and I tried this place out the other night as we were on a date. The atmosphere, service, and food were all great. We joked that our waiter was a ninja, because he was constantly on top of refilling our drinks and such without us even noticing. Big portions of food are given. We could have shared a plate between the two of us. We could only finish half of our sandwiches, so I had a whole sandwich to take home at the end of the night.

I visited Lux for the first time with a friend for coffee and breakfast. The atmosphere was great! The place has hipster vibe as well. It is also has plenty of space to sit inside and outside.   The coffee was everything coffee should be. I ate a blackberry orange scone - delicious!   There's much more to be explored about this place, so I will definitely be back to try out some other things!

This McD's service sucks. I have been here numerous times and have had some sort of bad service every single time.

This was my first time to visit this location. Great service. Nice atmosphere. Amazing coffee. The baristas are very personal. Will most definitely be back to visit.

My previous experience at this location was great. My experience tonight was anything but great. It took the barista five minutes to even come out from the back room. Then she was rude when she took my order. She wouldn't even talk directly to me except to ask me what size I wanted. She was too busy talking to her co-worker and friends that had come to visit. I watched for my drink after I ordered it, but it took a few minutes being that there was a lady ahead of me. I was getting my stuff around for a minute and she didn't even call out my drink - she just left it sitting on the counter. I mix it up and take a sip of it, ready to ignore all of that, only to have my tastebuds be overcome by all the extra flavor in the drink. I got a venti caramel crunch frappe and could only drink a fourth of it, because it tasted like I took a bottle of syrup and drank it.  I say all of that to say that it was the baristas working that made this experience a bad one. I still very much like this location, but I will have to watch for some decent baristas.

I haven't had bad service or a bad experience at all since my last review - it's actually been great each time! I've been back at least 10 times since then. And will continue to go back.

This is a regular hang-out spot for me and my friends. We come here late at night all the time for coffee and food. It has easily become one of my favorite coffee shops downtown. The coffee and food are awesome! I love that they stay open until midnight every night (and 24 hours on the weekend with a full menu)! It can become really packed inside at night as many people hang out here, but there is plenty of outside seating as well. Give it a try!

I've been here many times for coffee and tea. It's small and has a relaxed atmosphere. The service has always been great. It has become one of my favorite coffee shops downtown.

This Starbucks location is one of my favorites in Phoenix. The size of it is suitable for fairly large crowds - Comic Con was in town, and they had plenty of room for everyone that came. The baristas are super friendly and do their job very well - very professional. I spent a couple of hours there in between my meals and walk around the city. The drink I ordered was spot-on. The men's restroom was very clean (not sure about the women's... ha). There are plenty of outlets to plug in your electronic devices.   Would I recommend this Starbucks location to others? Absolutely. Will I be back? Most definitely.

A guy from 8th Day Coffee House recommended this place to me. How convenient that I was looking for a place to eat lunch after I got coffee, and there just happened to be a restaurant right behind them. I walked on over to Angels and grabbed a seat inside. A lady was bussing the tables near me as I took a seat and told me that a waitress would be with me in just a minute - she arrived within thirty seconds. She took my drink order and gave me a menu.   I am reviewing the food and service; I am not reviewing the beer as I have not tried any. The menu has so many great things to choose from. The Brewlee Burger is what caught my eyes. It consists of many things including (but not limited to): beef (or pork/chicken - your choice), pepper bacon, red sweet onions, chipotle mayo, spinach leaves, romaine lettuce, pepperjack cheese, and an over-easy egg on top. How does that NOT sound good? The fries are not frozen; they are real potatoes. They are seasoned well, crispy, and come with a homemade dipping sauce (not store-bought ketchup).   I put in my order and connected to the FREE WiFi to do some browsing. My burger was ready within ten to fifteen minutes. I knew that it would become one of my favorite burgers in Phoenix as I took a huge first bite. The flavors danced around on my palate and it began to rejoice. The burger is a great combination of spiciness and sweetness. The price was very reasonable for an enormous, outstanding burger and a large, crispy portion of fries.   The service was remarkable! Although busy, they made sure I had enough to drink, asked if I was enjoying my meal, and checked to see if I needed anything else.  Would I recommend this place to others? Absolutely. Will I return? You bet.

My previous review about the food still applies - absolutely amazing! I got the Brewlee Burger again. I want to try out those homemade poptarts sometime!  A friend and I went here for lunch yesterday. They were fairly busy, but that didn't stop this place from having great service last time I came. We waited (after our drink order was taken) at least fifteen minutes before our food order was taken. It wasn't too much of a problem though (except we were hungry) since we didn't need to be anywhere else afterwards. Once the order was taken we got our food within another fifteen minutes. The service was decent but has been better.  The atmosphere is amazing, like always. I'll definitely be back and continue to recommend this place to friends.

8th Day has become one of my favorite coffee shops since moving to Phoenix just a few weeks ago. I've been to 8th Day at least six times. My first experience was during First Friday. A friend and I walked to 8th Day earlier that afternoon to get some coffee - and I'm glad we did. We returned later that night for more coffee, music, and poetry readings. Their art displays are very unique and encouraging. My favorite cold, summer drinks so far are the Rwandan Chill (with hazelnut instead of vanilla) and a Honey Hazelnut Cream Chill (non-coffee). I definitely recommend both of those drinks! They like when I get creative. haha! The coffee is very good and is fair-trade. The service is beyond outstanding. There are plenty of places to just relax and enjoy your drink/food or even to meet with people. The only food I've tried so far is the blackberry bran breakfast treat - it was very good! It's great to be able to sit down with friends, drink coffee, and do good.

I work at Chipotle. I came here after our Cultivate Festival in Scottsdale. I immediately felt familiar with the ordering process and was amazed at all the choices and even the fire oven! I got two enchiladas with some mashed potatoes. Ordering was simple as you walk down the line and tell them what you want inside, on the side, and on top. The food was every bit of delicious as I had hoped! They even had some homemade pumpkin-spice maple brown sugar cookies that were a great addition to the meal! I'll be back!

I go to Short Leash pretty often. I was very disappointed at the service tonight because Short Leash is one of my favorite places and generally has great service. I sat down for 10+ minutes and the waitress passed by me many times without acknowledging me in any way. A large group walks in the door and in less than a minute she sat them down and gave them menus and everything. She then told them that they would have to go to the register one-by-one to order. There was no sign or anything spoken that it had changed from the usual sitting down and ordering. I waited another couple of minutes just to see if the waitress would say anything to me. I finally just walked out. If that's any preview of what the service would be for the rest of the meal, then I didn't want any part of it.

I waited a month since my last review to return. I realize they were in transition from sit-down service to counter service at the time. That doesn't bother me, but they had nothing displayed to show that they were transitioning, and nobody said anything about it to me when I walked in. I returned last week to see that they've moved the counter that used to be right beside the front door to the wall you face when you walk in. Now, you walk up to the counter (or grab a menu and stand in line), place your order, and pay. You then sit where you want and grab your own water by the patio door. They'll bring your drink and food out to you. They may check on you once, but if you need anything you'll have to ask. Also, the dessert (donuts and other things) are located in a display case beside the front counter.  The food was great as usual! I got a bratwurst and fried pickles with the dragon sauce - so good! I'll definitely continue to recommend this place to others.

This is a great place! I've been going here for a while and normally have Joe cut my hair. He takes his time and does a very good job. Today I set an appointment to have Joe cut my hair, but another barber (Gary) called me over to cut it since Joe was with someone. I should have waited on Joe.   Gary cut my hair and trimmed my beard in 20 minutes or less. It wasn't even busy and, according to him, had not been busy all day. I was left with a lot of long strands of hair, mustache hair still hanging over my lip (after specifically asking him to line it up), beard patchy (some spots with more hair than the stubble) on neck, and did not style my hair. Now I have to finish the job at home that I paid him to do. If I'm paying $31 for a haircut and beard trim, the person cutting it better take their time and pay attention. I'll only have Joe cut my hair from now on.

This is one of my favorite coffee shops in DTPHX. The owners, Troy and Kyu, are very friendly and get to know their customers on a personal level. I recommend the 6th Grader sandwich, Boylan Root Beer, strawberry rhubarb toast, cold brew coffee, ice cream, and cookies! They're all great!

I love this place! The Teapot is located only a couple of blocks away from where I live. I went many times the first couple of weeks after they opened, but I haven't been able to frequent it as much as I'd like lately. I work early mornings to early evenings, so I don't have a chance to visit during the week. They are typically open until 2 pm during weekdays. Jonathan (owner) said that they were thinking of doing some later hours later down the road.   The place is absolutely beautiful! It is very kid-friendly with a kid's corner inside and playground in the backyard to keep the kids occupied. If you are a parent and love coffee and coffee shops, this is the place for you and your child(ren). They also hold events from time to time like date nights, yoga, and build-your-own cactus (for the kiddos).  Jonathan and his wife are super friendly and love to have conversations with their customers and do a great job of remembering regulars! Definitely check this place out if you are ever in the area!
