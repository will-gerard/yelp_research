Mimi's never fails to be a good breakfast, my experience always vary's from server to server but the food is always consistently good.  Let be clear the service is never bad, however if it is busy they may forget your juice or muffin form time to time, just ask and they always make it right.

Normally we go to the breakfast spot around the corner, and with a longer than normal wait at our usual place we decided  to give Liberty Market a try.  The place is nice on the inside and the pastries on display look amazing.  So we ordered our food, the items on the menu look really good.  The food arrives and my Wife starts looking at the eggs strangely. I asked her what was wrong.  She slid the plate over to me and there were several long hairs cooked into the scrabbled eggs; GROSS!! So my kids, Mom, and me looked through the rest of our food, before calling the manager over.   Thank goodness we only found the embedded hairs in one set of scrabbled eggs.   We called the manager over and they apologized, and said they would bring a new plate of eggs out, which I expected. However in any restaurant I have ever been to, Management at the very least will cover the cost of the plate, but normally will comp the meal and/or give you a gift  certificate, so you will come back. Were we offered any of those from the management?  NO!!   The food is good, but not off the wall good like others have reviewed.   We all had different versions of the Demi-plate.   There are lots of places to eat and not management not offering to at least comp the plate of eggs ($3.50) is just bad business. If we had  been given a gift certificate, to come back,  we probably never would want to.  Next time we will wait an hour to go next door instead.

I like Venezia's for lunch, the slices are huge the wings are some of the best, and you don't have to spend a lot!!   If you like NY style pizza your will enjoy Venezia's.

So I finally got a chance to go here for the first time, and YUMMY is the word to describe this joint. My advice get the challah French toast.   My Wife got an omelet it was really delicious too. I need to come back and try the Amanda Burrito.

Mesquite Groves is awesome, and my little guy loves the bucket of water, I mean I think I can get him o pick up his room, clean the living room, and be nice to his sister just so he can go to the water bucket.  Seriously the amount of fun you can have for such a small amount of money, it would be redonkulous not to try at least once.

First time at Frio Mio it has great flavors and a fun atmosphere.  They offer 50% off for players in uniform, which is nice right after playing at Snedigar.  My kids liked the Xbox 360 that was setup.  We will be coming back here again!!!

How do I describe the experience at  Little Miss BBQ to everyone I come in contact with?  It's like waiting in line for the best ride at an amusement park, and once you step through the door your feet away from the ride, the smell and excitement is immense, and you've already forgotten about the wait, Scott mercifully give tasty bites of heaven to those waiting to order, then you get to order get your sides and checkout. If this is your first time you're probably limited to just sounds and utterances of joy with a big grin on your face. By the time your all done you'd happily do it over and over again.  It's breath takingly  good!!

I like the The Original Chop Shop, however this time my salad came out dry no dressing I had to ask. One of the other people I was with commented that their sandwich was good but noticed as well that there was no dressing. Chalk it up to an isolated experience, so I will have to try again.
