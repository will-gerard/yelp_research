I really should not enjoy bashing a Phoenician dynasty in the opening lines of this review, but what the heck, PF CHANGS SUCKS.  Yes, I said it, Its garbage.  Its a semi formal dining hall serving bland white meat chicken in a variety of sweet and sour sauces.  Restaurants like PF Changs exist, so that people don't have to motivate their taste buds to explore further reaching foods, especially Asian cuisine.    Then there is the Gourmet House of Hong Kong, masked in an entire ideology against Chain/Bad Chinese restaurants.  To say this is a "hole in the wall", would be an understatement of epic proportions.  Found on the corner of right around 10th street and McDowell, this inconspicuous dining hall stands, ready to show anyone who will listen, what true Cantonese cooking is.   Upon entering, do not be scared. No, it is not travertine tile, elaborate fish tanks, black napkins and the playmates of the month serving you your food.  Yes, that is really just a plain circle table with a white paper napkin and some soy sauce and chili oil containers. Yes, the restaurant is old and beaten up.  Yes, that is the smell of fish in the air, do not worry, in around three visits you will be swooning for that sweet aroma to come to your table.  Now lets talk about what matters.  THE FOOD.  Hands down, the best noodles in Arizona.  I recommend the shrimp chow mein.  It is a bed of soft egg noodles, crunchy on top with at least a dozen U-20 size shrimp and baby bok choy resting on a delicious sauce.  I could have this dish by itself every other night of the week and for ten dollars, I might as well.  The wor wonton soup is a deep flavorful broth, filled with not just one piece of broccoli and a few wontons, but swimming with shrimp, beef, chicken, vegetables and wontons.  The crispy dry noodles are a great accompaniment to the soup and are always on the house.  Want to try something different? How about a "scramble with shrimp".  This is just as it sounds, a Cantonese variation of egg foo young, that is a medium bed of fluffy scrambled egg with shrimp and green onion mixed in, just phenomenal.  Right now they are serving 1.5-2 pound lobsters for eighteen dollars. That's a ridiculously great deal for such a large lobster. They will make it any way you want, I recommend steamed with black bean sauce and green peppers.    I could go on and on and about this place, but I will stop here.  Let it be said though, if you are looking for atmosphere or a contemporary hip restaurant, this is not your place. If you are looking to get down and dirty and eat some real Cantonese cuisine, you will not find a better place in the valley.

Tacos De Juarez never fails to satisfy my Mexican food cravings.    This is another one of the valleys long running, authentic, Mexican joints that just use a tried and true method of success: keep it simple!  Fresh ingredients and traditional menu choices make for a consistent and tasty output, each and every visit.  I always love the tacos here and the chimichanga is cooked perfectly and covered in sour cream and guacamole, both of which are the perfect accompaniment. I order an extra side of rice because I never feel like I get enough, but for the price point, who cares, you never spend more than 10-15 dollars per person.  If you are on McDowell heading down towards the arena to take in a Suns game, you can stop here and be rest assured that the food will be great.

Let me just preface this review by saying that it does pain me to write a negative review about almost any establishment in the valley.  Unfortunately for India Delhi, it has to be done.  Honestly, I have not dined inside this restaurant, my experience is purely from multiple take out orders over the past year.  Living in Arcadia and loving food as I do, I am lucky in the fact that I do not have to travel far to enjoy ethnic culinary delights that other cultures have to offer.  If your a foodie in the 21st century, Indian food is all over your radar.  India Delhi, found at 54th street and McDowell in Phoenix, fits the bill of almost every other Indian restaurant in the valley. Nice external building, clean looking restaurant and the normal tinctures related to that region of the world.    Always friendly and eager to take your order, the young gentleman at the front counter has never let me down in taking care of my to go order. Always checking each container to make sure it has the correct contents, etc.  On the Saturday I am referencing for this review, the young man was not there, but the owner and his wife were. In my opinion, Indian food is not a cheap venture. I always find myself wanting to try a dish as well as getting a staple that I know is going to be solid. When you add in the extra charge for rice(never included), yogurt sauce(not included), etc, the bill for myself and companion always tops $40.  I usually do not gripe as I know the quality will be there and I just love the food, what can I say.  On this Saturday though, something was different. This was evident from the moment I walked in the door, I could not put my finger on it, but something was just not vibing.  The owners wife(or co owner for all I know) was at the counter and asked if I wanted the buffet. I politely turned it down as I am not a fan of buffet food, especially with Indian cuisine.  I politely turned that down and proceeded to order tandoori chicken, saag paneer, chicken biryani, basmati rice and some naan.    What happened next is not something I will forget soon.  I watched as the owner walked out of the kitchen with the pan in hands and used the spinach for my saag paneer from the buffet.  The owners and my eyes met as he processed that I saw what he was doing.  In that moment, the owner sold and gave up all his culinary credibility. He proceeded to head back to the kitchen to use said items.    I waited for another fifteen minutes and took my order home.  What did I find? The chicken biryani, the only item I might add not in the buffet, was extremely hot, almost too hot to touch.  The saag paneer was warm at best. The tandoori chicken was a collection of small legs(customary for Indian buffets) and once again, not hot.  I knew what had happened and could not help feeling beyond annoyed with the situation.   Normally, I just deal with what is, I do not ever send food back and especially on to-go orders.  This time was different, I could not let it go.  I called the restaurant and without pause the owner got on, knowing exactly who I was and what the problem was. He put up a fight for around 20 seconds saying that he just used the spinach as a base for the saag paneer and what not, but then finally just apologized and said he would "make it right."    I do not really see myself going back here, but who knows.  This is a good excuse to venture out and try some more of the valleys offerings in this arena.

Wish I could echo the sentiment of the others who received great services from here, but after waiting for an hour on Friday at 3 in the afternoon for a trim, Ill have to pass and go back to V's.  At the very least, they understand the concert of supply/demand. If its friday, hey, maybe we should have more than 2 barbers. Just a thought A&D.  Congrats to the others who got service here, there was no way in hell I am waiting over an hour to get my hair cut.

Why did I not get the name of my Barber? It is only once in a while you meet a barber who is so talented, they know they are going to give you a good haircut no matter what you look like when you walk in.  I will just have to call back and ask for the name of the brilliant barber wearing the yalrumaka:)    I love going to the barber, for me its the entire experience.  I love getting shaves, it is one of my finest pleasures in life.  Whenever I travel I make a note to get a shave at whatever the highest rated barber in the area I'm traveling in is found.  Here in Phoenix there are a few places that you can get a great shave, this is definitely one of them.  Looking down on my barbers workstation, its hard to miss the picture of John McCain, who is one of his regular clients.  The haircut was fast, fluid and precise.  There is absolutely nothing more you can ask for from a haircut then when the barber shows you the mirror and you got exactly what you wanted.  I am not even sure I described to my barber what i wanted, but he just took the reigns and made it happen.    As for the shave, well, I believe at this point in my life I am a very good judge of the barber shop shave. Having experienced it in more than ten countries and many more here in the states, I feel i have had the best and worst our valley tonsorialists have to offer.  This shave was spot on.  The initial hot towel was temperature acclimated. The blade strokes were short and even and my barber checked every nook and cranny to make sure all the little hairs were taken care of.  I would have liked to have seen some of the middle eastern rituals of the shave, IE. threading of the face to get the small parts you cannot see and few more hot towels, but for the price and quality, this is amazing.  For the time being, this establishment has at the very least, my haircut business.  As for the straight razor shaves, it is hard to ignore some of the long term skills of the valleys barbers like Mr. Mirzakan at Exclusively Mens or Sam as Goodfellas in North Scottsdale, but this place still brings it. I am giving this one four stars and will update this review upon my next visit.

On a Sunday morning in phoenix, you are often left thinking about the fact that a good breakfast is neither close nor available.  In fact, you could sum up the valleys breakfast nooks as vacant or un found.  There is one beacon of breakfast hope that can be found in the central corridor, and Vincents be thy name.  Obviously Vincents is a culinary staple in the valley that is known far and wide and adorned by all.  What is somewhat unknown to valley foodies is that right behind the main Vincents restaurant sits "Vincents Bistro."  What does that mean to the food masses? The best price point in the valley on fine dining in a great setting.  Before you engage the menu, make sure to enjoy the house made croissants and butter, this little treat will get your senses going in the right direction.    The menu at the Bistro is not complex(neither is the main dining room), but has staples such as Vincents famous smoked salmon quesedilla($10) and main lobster with handmade basil pasta($14).  The Bistro has a daily prix fixe menu that uses the following methodology. An appetizer of choice, a main entree of choice and dessert.  The price tag is never greater than $20 for the prix fixe and I challenge another restaurant in the valley to beat it.  Choices can range from prime new york steak, to lamb chops to a wonderfully cooked piece of fish.   What are the cons? Good luck coordinating a take out order with the normal busyness of the operation.  Wait times for pick up can range from forty-five minutes to over an hour.  If you feel like your caught in the middle of a whirlwind circus when picking up your order, don't worry, that's just the normal pace.    In 1982 Vincent Guerithault catapulted Arizona into the beginning phases of the culinary elite the other larger metropolis cities were already enjoying.  Now, thirty years later, he has done it again with the Bistro.  I applaud Vincent and his family on their success and longevity in the valley culinary circuit.

Sinaloa does not look like much from the outside. Well, lets be honest, it doesn't look like much from the inside either.  That is okay, in this town, that is usually a good sign that you are about to have a killer meal.  That thinking did not fail to prove true, Sinaloa is fantastic.  When I ask my friends which Mexican seafood restaurants they like around town, I usually get this return glare that says "are you being serious?"  Yes folks, the Hispanic community can cook(or crudo) seafood the same as the rest of the world and it is good.    I usually get the cold squid appetizer.  It is a salad of squid, lettuce, spices and it just delicious. I have never ordered this and left any on the plate. This dish has converted more than a few people to the treasure of Mexican seafood.  My dad loves the filete de chef, which is a large fillet of fish cooked with the chefs special sauce on a bed of rice.  I love the seafood stew which is always filled with goodies like fish, shrimp and squid.    Do not expect the bill to be cheap if you eat like I do, but certainly reasonable for the quality and quantity you are offered.  Four stars for this restaurant, I will be back soon!

Tea Light Cafe is a great restaurant, no doubt about it.  The only reason for not ticking in at five stars is because of the lack of depth to the menu.  Other than that, the food is impeccable, owners are extremely friendly and the decor and seats always accommodate.    I always order the same thing here, the chicken pho.  I grab a table next to the wall and proceed to wait approx three minutes for that cart to come rolling out of the kitchen with various goodies, all for my consumption!  The huge bowl of soup that arrives, steaming all the way to your table, has a fantastic aroma.    I highly recommend hitting this place up after you see a movie in the theater next door.

I am going to visit C-Fu for dinner again and write a review for that separately. It has been a while since I visited this place for just dinner, so I will keep this review to my recent visit for dim sum.  In my humble opinion, C-Fu is the best Dim Sum in the valley. I am a firm believer in having to switch up dim sum joints between here, China King and Phoenix Palace, to keep it fresh. That being said, when bringing someone new into the world of dim sum or when entertaining from out of town, C-Fu is old faithful for consistency and variety.   The owner is constantly walking around with the most exotic of the dim sum dishes, lobster, clams in black bean sauce, calamari, etc.  Plenty of the standard dumplings and spring rolls to be found for the timid while the next cart brings chicken feet, tripe and tofu wrapped egg rolls for the more experienced.   I generally order the 50/50 jasmine flower tea instead of the normal fare, but both are solid choices, no matter what you end up with.  When the meal is done, you simply take your card to the front, tip is added automatically and you are on your way out.  Giving C-Fu four stars for the dim sum and dinner review to follow.....

THE VALLEY HAS GONE/BEED MAD   Alright folks, as I am sure most of my reviews already spur scorn and outrage to those who read me trashing their favorite establishments, this one cannot be avoided.  This place is garbage.  This is not fish and chips and it is an insult to the term "fish and chips" to suggest otherwise.  The "fish" is some hybrid type of fish that I have never known in my thirty one years of seafood eating.  It comes in a weird pocket shape that reminds me of a potato knish from Coney Island(which is phenomenal if you get a chance to try one).  The shrimp appeared to walk through on stilts, but thankfully was surrounded by a sub par and tasteless breading.    What does the valley see in this place? Someone explain it to me because I am truly baffled, this food is just terrible.

What makes a great restaurant? The food? The ambiance? The service?  The Golden Greek, found in an inconspicuous strip mall on the west side of town, is a valley treasure.  It is a treasure because its encompasses the best of all the traits listed above.  Yes, now that I live in Arcadia its a long drive.  Living in North Scottsdale, it was even worse.  It just doesn't matter, this restaurant is where its at.    Run by the same family, for what seems like the past 30 years, the food is always amazing, the service always kills, and the vibe/mood of the restaurant has never changed.  Only ten or so small tables in the dining room with minimal Greek infused music playing on the speakers and a few pictures of the Greece on the wall.  The sister of the family runs the floor and has watched much of the valley grow up eating from her plates.  There are both a list of hot and cold appetizers.  I always get the calamari and the smelts, they are both outrageously good.  My mother usually has the cold appetizer platter, which has mounds of grape leaves, feta, taramasalata and many other treats.  For dinner, I always get the same thing, the garithes scorpios.  Its a plate of large shrimp cooked in lemon white wine sauce over a bed of rice.  I could eat this every day of my life and be more than content.  They also serve some Italian staples like pasta, ravioli and lasagna, but the genius of the restaurant are the Greek delicacies.  Thank you for staying in the Valley and gracing us with your presence, you get the highest rating, Five Stars!

Had the pleasure of enjoying House of Tricks last night, for the second time in the past twelve months.  With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.    Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went.  I had the pork belly, on Jamie's suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They weren't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening.  For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.    With little room left for dessert, we ordered three selections for the table to share.  All were good and once again our plates were cleaned off.  The dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces.    All in all, this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service.  I would eat here again and recommend you to do the same.

So here I was thinking I was going to really hook up this shop with a 5 star review and shocker, the whole world already knows this is the best place on the planet.    Jeremy and his crew quite simply run the only automotive spot anyone should consider going too. Feel free to check out my other yelp reviews, I am generally a picky bastard who tears business's apart for being assholes. This place does it all perfectly.  Jeremy owns the spot and seems to be there whenever the doors are open making sure the place is run perfectly.   I have now had Exclusive Collision help me on two accidents and they changed the entire scenario both times. Saving me thousands of dollars wasn't required and yet this shop seems to thrive on doing right by people and helping them out in their darkest hours, which lets be honest, is usually when dealing with family drama and auto accidents/insurance companies.   Do yourself a favor and just have your car towed straight there if you get into an accident. This place has years of experience in dealing with all the insurance companies and how to put a car back together or know when to throw in the towel and total it out. This type of experience and management from their team is invaluable, you just don't know it until your actually in an accident.  To Jeremy and his entire staff, Thank You, you guys are crazy awesome, there needs to be a 6 star rating on yelp for the true business game changers.

I LOVE THIS PLACE  El Grand Taquito takes me back to a good memory during a painful stint on the west side of the valley I spent when I was younger. My dad and I would take the proverbial fifteen minute drive down 59th avenue, always hoping to not get stopped by a train at Grand avenue.  Throughout the years, nothing has really changed about El Grande Taquito, especially the food.  This restaurant is the most authentic form of Mexican cooking I have found in the entire valley.  The people who run the restaurant are extremely friendly and have always made myself and father feel at home.  Be prepared to order your food in Spanish, no one here really speaks English that well.  The decor of the restaurant while plain, includes a jukebox with all the hits from Latin America.    As I write this review, I am reminded of one of the first trips my dad and I took here.  I do not remember what landed us there, I think we were heading down towards the library. Nonetheless, we stopped in when we saw the sign for food and figured what the hell.  It was an interesting first few minutes, I will admit.  A few of the patrons seemed to be eying us up and down, wondering why we were encroaching on one of their treasures.  My dad, being the brilliant doctor that he is, decided to buy a round of beers for one of the tables of gentleman sitting next to us.  It is too bad that world conflicts are not solved so easily, because we became the hits of the restaurant that day.  Besides the fact my dad was bought at least two beers by other people there, we were welcomed into the restaurant and were ready to enjoy the trough of food we ordered.  The menu includes many normal staples found on the menus of the valley, but then the you get to the tacos.  It is hard to find tripas and cabeza around the valley. It is even harder to find it prepared properly.  Now don't judge us, but when the old man and I get together to eat Mexican food, it is not a pretty sight. We generally order a minimum of eight tacos between us and various other entrees.  I always get the chicken chimichanga, two tripas and one cabeza taco with a side of rice.  My dad gets a few of the same, minus the chimi and usually an extra tripas burrito.  At El Grande Taquito, we dine like Kings and all for under thirty dollars.   All of the food tastes so vibrant, fresh and just outright delicious.  Each taco looks meticulously put together by hand and in perfect unison with the next in line.  The meat is cooked perfectly and the perfect blend of spices and marinade make each bite more explosive than the one previous.    I would not necessarily recommend it for a first date or really any date for that matter.  This is a place to go with your friends, on a nice day, when you are craving the absolute best, most authentic Mexican food in the valley.  I hope this restaurant never leaves the valley, it is a gem.

So I finally went out and experienced this valley staple that so many recommended to me.  My thoughts are summed up by the two star yelp description; Meh, I've experienced better.  What am I missing here? This food is not very good.  I guess if you like big portion's I do not), then that would be a positive note for this restaurant.    My companion and I ordered a few different menu items, including the Chile Relleno, a Chimichanga and beef taco.  Let us start with the beef taco.  The appearance actually looked good. Crispy taco shell with colorful lettuce, tomato and cheese all over and the beef was decently cooked.  Unfortunately, the bottom of the taco had broken apart from the amount of oil, which make it hard to eat, but not bad.  The chimichanga was huge and covered with what seemed like three different sauces, and way too much of all three.  The chimi itself was not crunchy and totally lacking in flavor, most of it went un eaten.    I left the Chile Relleno description till the end, because this was nothing short of funny.  I have had Chile Relleno around fifty times in my life, minimum.  Never, ever ever, have I seen a plate of Chile Relleno look like this. You need to picture a football sized shell of some white substance with a plate of melted cheese below it. Seriously, it was bizarre and complete disgusting, dish was left completely untouched.  I am unsure how the kitchen lets a dish leave looking like that, totally revolting.  Anyways, I am on my lonesome on this review, based on the fact there was an hour wait tonight on a Sunday and you cannot even get into the parking lot.  Go figure. I will not be back.

Yes Yes Yes  China King is just another reminder, that the drought left by the absence of China Doll on 7th avenue, is long over.  China King is a medium size restaurant found in Chandler(shocker) and serves both a full menu and dim sum on the weekends.  The dim sum, while light on the variety in my opinion, is always spot on, meticulously made and phenomenal tasting.  You can always count on China King to bring the best quality dim sum each and every service.  The regular dinner menu consists of time honored traditions that the Chinese community in Chandler has embraced with open arms.  My favorite selections from the menu are the hot pots and unique vegetable dishes.  The tofu and seafood hot pot selection quite simply cant be beat.  The braised bok choy is always tender and explosively flavorful.    Never had a bad meal here and do not see it happening in the near future.   Four stars China King!

Would like to have rated the restaurant better, but unfortunately I cannot eat there as I am 5.2 miles away from Corleone's and there delivery radius is 5 miles. Nope, not kidding, called in for delivery, was asked for my address after a 2 minute wait, was put back on hold and the woman came back on the phone to tell me, "i am sorry, we dont deliver to your area". My response was, "uh, we are 10 minutes down the road, what is your delivery area?" Her answer "the delivery area is 5 miles, you are outside of it."  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, COMICAL REALLY.

Visited this spot for the first time last weekend.  Upon entering, you notice the internals of the restaurant are immaculate.  It is a less is more attitude on the decor and it works for the intended setting.  There is a viewing case of the offered pastries of the day and that is where you will find most people bobbing their heads in excitement of their anticipated treats.  Upon the initial review of the menu, I was happy to see such a strong price point in a specialty cafe.   Having your entire breakfast repertoire being priced below ten dollars almost made me want to try a few different breakfast ideas.  After a brisk review, I decided on the breakfast sandwich and an iced latte, while my companion chose the eggs benedict and a cappuccino.    I could see the chef via the semi open kitchen, working furiously to move the orders up to the window for delivery.  Upon arrival, I was pleasantly surprised by a fluffy croissant filled with a perfectly cooked egg and ham stuffing.  The sandwich, while not huge in size, most certainly delivered.  The accompany spinach salad had side container of goat cheese, which made the entire dish perfectly pulled together.    My companions eggs benedict turned out to be just one minaret of egg, ham, perfectly toasted english muffin and silky hollandaise sauce, rather than two.  The hash browns were home made, textured and tasty, making it a great accompaniment.  It should be noted that the heavy majority of restaurants serving eggs benedict consider two eggs the standard, rather than one, so be prepared you might want more.  Both of our coffee beverages were made with care and tasted great.    I would recommend this establishment to anyone looking for solid food at a great price point in a comfortable atmosphere.  Further review coming after I visit again to try out their dinner ideas.

What even is the real name of this restaurant? Is it Kanpai as written on the door? Is it Kampai as written on the sign? I actually have no idea and for the sake of this review, it doesn't really matter. Here is what is important about this little restaurant on the west side of town. The two chefs who own and run this restaurant, brought sushi to the valley. No, I am not kidding and its not debatable, AJ and Yuki are the original gangsters of the sushi manifestation that has occurred in Phoenix.   In order to understand this revelation, we need to go back to 1985(see what I did there). A small sushi restaurant opens in Paradise Valley, right across the street from the mall. It is called Shogun and for many years is the premier sushi restaurant in the valley. Actually, for a while, it was the only sushi restaurant in the valley. Shogun has gone through various restorations and renovations over the years, but originally, it was AJ and Yuki at the small sushi bar inside Shogun with around five or six tables. These sushi geniuses built Shogun into the dynasty that it was and after a few years, moved onto their own venture, named Kampai or Kanpai, depending on which signage you are currently viewing.   Kampai, found in a very shady strip mall on Bell road, has the best sushi in the valley. There is not a close second. Yuki is the main sushi chef and AJ runs the back end kitchen. Word of warning and the reason for the lack of five stars in this review. If Yuki is not your sushi chef, I cannot vouch for the restaurant at all. I know I know, that sounds brutal, but it's the truth. Yuki is an artist and meticulous. The other chefs just are not in his league and some of the specialties of the house, only taste their best when made from Yuki's hands.   What makes this place so special? It certainly isn't the decor, which could not be more plain. It is far from the waitress service that is at best, hard to understand. It is the fact that the spicy tuna hand roll is the best I have ever had. The southwest salmon roll, while not only amazing, is only found at this sushi bar, no matter where in the country I have dined on sushi. The southwest salmon roll Is an inside out roll, with salmon and a house cured chili pepper with cucumber and masago on the outside. It is my favorite sushi roll on the planet. As for the sushi, this is the only place in the valley, besides Hiro in North Scottsdale, who serves live scallops. At Hiro, you will pay an arm and a leg, at Kampai, they will be fresher and you will pay fair market price, as set by AJ. The yellowtail and salmon sushi are always cured perfectly, not salty and melt in your mouth.   There are both entree specials and sushi specials listed on the white boards above and next to the sushi bar. AJ makes the best salmon and yellowtail collars in the business, while serving better versions of the standard sushi bar appetizer fare, IE. Fried oysters, tempura, etc..   I will end this review here, but rest assured, if you are looking for the best, most authentic sushi dinner in the valley, Kampai is the place.

Seing as how I work right down the road from this location, I have become a frequent mid day visitor of this Starbucks.  The drive through is always moving and they are consistent with every return trip.  I had to wait for a few minutes, no more than 10, and when I got to the front of the line, they comped my entire order of four drinks, nice touch.  I always see them moving people in and out with efficiency, so they get a four star review from me. At this point, you either have gotten used to the burnt taste of Starbucks or not, but complaining about, this late in the game, is annoying.

Let me begin this review by apologizing in advance, to all I offend and the other previous yelpers who have reviewed this establishment with such high regards.  My companion and I were greeted by a warm welcome by hostess and immediately seated at our table.  My first impressions of the waiter was that he was both friendly and attentive, that would be the saving grace(if any) of this experience.  While there were many open booths and tables, we were seated in between two older couples in the back of the restaurant. It was so quiet, I asked our waiter if we were allowed to talk.  We ordered the bottled water service and received our menus.  Upon receipt of the menu, my eyes lit up.  There were so many dynamic choices and eye catching listings, that I was having trouble deciding upon both my appetizer and entree.  I ordered a dirty grey goose martini with extra olives and my companion a glass of Cabernet.  My martini was not dirty at all, which made it somewhat enjoyable as it was just chilled vodka,  but the blue cheese olives were abundant and phenomenal.   Our first course arrived and we had decided to share the sweetbreads and the vegetable risotto.  I was a few bites in when it dawned on me that I was about to have an "Avalon" moment.  An exhilarating menu with food that falls infallibly short.  The sweetbreads were covered in some charred type substance neither of us could make out. The sweetbreads were tough and had absolutely no seasoning. The lack of seasoning would become a trend of the entire evening.  The vegetable risotto is not listed or advertised correctly.  It is a small layer of sauce, a few kernels of arborio rice and a pile of vegetables.  I like vegetables as well, but when I am ordering risotto, I would actually like the starch as well.  The risotto needed more than a few pinches of salt and the sweetbreads were inedible.    I thought at this point, that the entrees we had ordered would save the day.  I would be wrong.  My companion ordered the house specialty, the squab.  In my twenty five years of dining, I have never been so embarrassed for a kitchen, as i was for this kitchen, when the food was tasted.  The squab was supposed to be a two legs, confit style, and two breasts that were roasted.  Oh my.  How this dish was able to leave the kitchen I will never quite understand.  It was entirely undercooked, gamey, unseasoned, uncuttable and overall ghastly, just ghastly.  My scallops looked appealing, but for a thirty-two dollar price tag, I was hoping for a bit more than four scallops and a small stack of greens.  Nevertheless, i forged ahead and gave it a try.  The scallops were undercooked, underseasoned(see a trend here?), and utterly tasteless.    My dining partner and I stared at each other for a few moments before we started laughing. One of the best parts about having a really bad meal is that you get to joke about it for a while and the bad meal repays itself in comedy.  That would not be the case here.  When the bill was brought to me and I opened to review, my mouth hit the floor.  Fifteen dollars for that crappy martini? Fourteen dollars in water? We figured that one out, that the waiter brought us a new bottle at the end of the meal, without us asking us and the bottle remained 95% full, but we were charged an additional seven dollars for it.  The bill of $154 dollars, was an outrage to say the least. The squab was inedible, the scallops a disaster, and the appetizers a joke.  Sorry for bursting the bubble for people on this one, but my recommendation is to PASS.

What can I say that everyone else has not already confirmed. This place is great!!!!  Its always hard to fine Billecart-Salmon Champagne in the valley, especially at a good price.  Total wine was selling them at eighty seven a bottle, unbelievable!!!  Excellent selection of each wine category.   Very nice staff, lines were moving at the checkout, five stars all around!!

As a frequent patron of Hula's I figured it was about time to write a review. As other yelpers have found, based on the four star rating achieved, this place is a good find.   Your often greeted by a man in a Hawaiian shirt with a smile and a friendly hello. If you are lucky, this is the person who will be making your drink(s), because he is one of the best bartenders in the valley. Future patrons would be wise to let him know what you like and leave the rest in his hands.   The patio is not only spacious and comfortable, but somehow shielded from the sounds of central avenue traffic. While I certainly prefer to enjoy Hulas on the patio, the architecture of the inside is amazingly well presented, as an extension of the patio.   The food is certainly solid with certain stand out menu items like the Poke, pulled pork and the ahi eggs benedict for brunch. Obviously being a bar, the main attraction are the libations being poured, but its important to have food that compliments the both the vibe and experience and Hula's achieves this with gusto.   Highly recommend this place if you are in the central corridor looking to cool down on a hot afternoon or celebrating Friday night with your friends late night.

Let me start this review by simply saying, thank you to Crudo.  Crudo, found in old town Scottsdale, is actually inside of a salon right on the corner of 3rd avenue.  Yes, that is right, its inside a retail business operation.  Parking has never been a problem, including last night on a Saturday on Valentines day weekend.  Originally founded by Cullen Campbell and Branden Crouser, formerly of Atlas Bistro, now the kitchen is run by just Cullen, as Branden as moved onto to take over as executive chef at Avalon.  Let me be clear, Cullen Campbell is a culinary genius.  It is reflected not only in his menu or dishes, but in the entire way he operates his business.  This is a chef who will not compromise quality for quantity, on any level.  When yelpers describe what a five star requires, they are speaking about the qualities that Mr. Campbell bring to the valley within Crudo.  Last nights visit brought my standard choice of going off menu for a seven course tasting menu with Chef Campbell making all the decisions for both myself and companion.   Our waitress, with her ever present English accent, informed myself and companion that the live sea urchin would not be on the menu, as there was rough seas yesterday, and their supplier could not fish.  No, I am not kidding guys, this is the type of information you receive at restaurants that tout authenticity and true culinary inventiveness.  I was informed though, that there was some amazing foie gras in the house and I would be seeing it later.  I am getting off track though, so lets get down to what matters.  The Amuse presented to our table was a delightful plate of in house smoked olives.  They were beautifully presented and tasted unique, even for olives.  We were not even into our first course yet and my companion and I shared that look worth a million dollars between us; This was going to be a great evening.    Our first course arrived and it was Chef Campbell's tried and true favorite, his butterfish crudo.  This is a beautiful, inviting, and absurdly delicious plate of sliced butterfish, marinated with olive oil, spices and what tasted like candied nuts.  No matter what changes to the menu the chef makes over time, this dish will always be there, just ask Thomas Keller at the French Laundry if he can remove his pearls of tapioca or tuna ice cream cones from the menu.  Our second course arrived at the table touting a bright red piece of tuna and fresh heirloom tomato.  Well seasoned with cracked sea salt and the tomato being extremely fresh made this dish satisfying and enjoyable.  We were almost done with our first bottle of champagne when course numero tres arrived and the conger eel made its appearance.  Chef, what are you trying to do me here?  This Eel was so good its scary.  It was a rectangle piece of cooked eel over braised kale.  This dish just kicked my ass, plain and simple, I could eat it for lunch or dinner every day of the week.  We somewhat left the fish courses for the second half of the menu as the braised veal with polenta arrived.  The veal was tender, succulent and tasty as hell.  The polenta, surely house made, was excellent and the perfect accompaniment to the veal.  As this dish ended, some risotto hit the table. Not just any risotto, no, squid ink risotto.  I am unsure where else in Arizona I can acquire squid ink anything, let alone risotto, but here it was, sitting in front of us, in all its glory.  The risotto was cooked perfectly, spread out across the bowl in its perfect texture and sauce and tasted as if I was eating on Iron Chef Japan, the real Iron Chef television show(not the bullshit you see on food network nowadays).    Just as I thought the evening could not get any better, course number seven arrived, the foie gras.  Lets talk for a second here, alright.  Chef Campbell served my party, a peanut butter and jelly foie gras sandwich. True story.  It took me a second to figure out what was going on my plate as it hit the table, but i quickly figured it out.  There was a thick and delicious slice of prime foie gras on the plate. Underneath, a silky and savory peanut sauce with nuts, while on top of the foie gras was a delicate sauce of poached pear.  Served on the side were thin slices of homemade Challah bread.  Who does this chef think he is??? When put together, this dish kicked the ever loving shit out of me in a way that cannot begin to describe.  It was genius, it was brilliance, it was inventive, it was one chef single handily taking the valley to the next level of culinary adventures.  There is not much more I can say about this restaurant. There is no six star rating on Yelp.  Here is my conclusion, if you consider yourself a foodie, if you consider yourself a culinary adventurer, then do yourself the favor and go to Crudo.  Call ahead, introduce yourself, make a reservation and let them know you are coming for the time of your life. This is the restaurant to treat yourself too, this is the future.

This restaurant proves the theory that good food in Phoenix sells, no matter what the location.    Becketts Table is found in what was previously an Italian restaurant that never had a wait or what appeared to be more than two cars in the parking lot.  Now, as Becketts Table, your lucky to get a reservation on Friday or Saturday and even luckier to go on a weekday and not find a line of people waiting in the rears.  The interior of the restaurant has been completely renovated and it looks great.  Whenever I see an open kitchen, i cant help but think it gives some credibility to the kitchen ethic.  Myself and companion started out with the chicken liver pate and the appetizer special of the night, a pork belly enchilada.  Both appetizers were a real treat and something I would not generally find around my local restaurants here in Arcadia.  For the entrees I had the short ribs and my companion had the chicken and dumplings.  The short ribs were very tasty and by the amount of orders going out of the kitchen, I can tell its a big hit.  The chicken and dumplings were a solid dish, but I think I would have liked a side of rice or some starch to go with it.    Service was right on point, environment was great and the food was extremely solid.  I would recommend this place to anyone and I will be back soon to enjoy it again myself.

This is a great dentists office.    I have had the pleasure of visiting Dr. Hoods office for the past three years and the service, professionalism, and friendliness of the staff has never changed.    Dr. Hood has decades of experience in all aspects of dental science and is always expanding his knowledge base to be on the cutting edge.  When you add into that, that the office maintains a very old school family practice feel, its the perfect melding of both worlds, old and new.    Located just south of 16th and Camelback, you will have no problem finding the building.  More important, you will not have a problem working with the scheduling of the front office as they are always finding ways to get people in and out and make special accommodations to fit all schedules.  Once you are in the care of Dr. Hood and his loyal staff, many of whom have been with him for multiple years, you will have no need to look elsewhere.

Lets start with the positives.  The staff here is super friendly.  Everyone behind the counter is in good spirits and looks to be enjoying their time as much as possible during work hours.  They also have free peanuts upon arrival, much to the like of the Teakwoods bar establishment in the valley.  Those would be the two positives encompassing the lack of just wiping the floor with Five Guys and giving them the one star rating.  I ordered the normal burger, which is actually two patties as opposed to the little burger which is just one patty.  I added the bacon, grilled mushrooms, grilled onions lettuce, tomato, and light mayo. I made sure to ask for light mayo, because there does not need to a gallon of it on my hamburger, like most places in town like to garner.  Of course I am going to try the french fries, so an order of those went on the bill to conclude.  After a short wait, I collected my order and proceeded to survey the land.   The hamburger is tasteless, there is no other way to say it. It is not good. Its not an opinion, this burger is just plain garbage.  Perhaps the staff could take the half gallon of salt they are putting on the fries and move a partial amount to the meat, because there is quite simply no seasoning and thus no taste. Ah yes, a nice treat, my light mayo was in fact slathered all over the top and bottom of the bun, always fun to take the mass napkins given to me to deconstruct the burger, wipe off superfluous mayo and return burger to original state. I took two bites and through the burger away, its just not good.  The fries are decent, I suppose. Maybe I was just really hungry from not eating the burger I had such high hopes to enjoy.  So much for Five Guys, total bust.  Note of review, the establishment does happen to have those cool tech soda machines that let you mix all sorts of different soft drinks together. I made a 50/50 coke zero lemon/lime mix.    Take my advice, avoid this place and make the trek to Zinburger, you will not be sorry.

Truly a bizarre experience here, more than a bad one, but shitty nonetheless, thus the one star.  I will start with the positives in fairness to the restaurant, as they did just open a few weeks ago.   1) The food is alright. Nothing too special, nothing bad.  Alright, with the good out of the way, lets get into the bad. This place is an epic service fail, with the hash-tag and all.  Originally, I had four friends at my house and we ordered take out from the restaurant. I placed a $70 order for food and please take note of the dollar amount, it will be important later.  We each ordered a combo plate, so five combo plates, each with a couple different items. I made sure to tell them on my order, that I do not want beans, as I am allergic to them.  Order was taken and I was told to be there in approximately 30 minutes.  I showed up to the restaurant right on time and was told to wait. Not a big deal, a few minutes wont kill me, at least they are getting the order right and it was a large order. After waiting twenty minutes, they delivered the order and I left.   What ensued was quite simply the most absurd packaging job ever. I will try and break it down. So on three of the five combos, we had a taco ordered. Well, they put the three tacos in the same box ,not with their respective combo. They did this with everyones order. So it was kind of like a buffet, but having to rebuild what you had ordered. Why on earth would you do this? Add to that, they still got the order wrong and left out items while including stuff no one ordered.  To cap it, they had beans and rice in every box, so I could not eat it anyways.   I politely called the restaurant and the manager eagerly took my call. She apologized profusely and offered to either refund the money or would rather have me come back in and will credit my meal and mark it in her log. I really respected her cantor on the call and her professionalism and took the credit instead, as I was willing to give this neighborhood spot a second chance as the manager had won me over and I wanted to have another go to Mexican restaurant near by.  Fast forward a week later and myself and girlfriend go into said Garcias to dine in person. Upon walking in, I asked the hostess about my credit and she said she would ask the manager. We were seated at a nice table for two and within a couple of minutes a manager approached our table. She introduced herself and for a moment acted like she didn't remember our call. Then I said check your log and she came back with our waiter and said "oh yes, I spoke to you on the phone and noted it, I am really glad you came back" She put her hand on the waiter, who was standing literally next to her and said "he will take care of anything you need". Everyone smiled, situation is good, lets order. We order one appetizer, the espinaca con queso and we each order a combo. Food is delivered timely, hot, and pretty good, not great, but decent enough, we think all is fine.  Now the waiter says "I will bring you your check." So I am thinking, he must know I want to tip him and didn't bring cash, so he is going to charge me a dollar so I can tip on my card. Nope, this guy brings me a $32 bill. I look at him and say, "Sir, we were supposed to be credited, by your manager who was standing here." This guy literally looks right at me and says "What? I don't remember". My girlfriend and I just look at each other because we are now sure we are on camera, this must be an elaborate prank. I say right back to him "you were standing right here, are you on something?" He looks at me and then says he will go ask another manager, that manager we spoke too, with him there has left. He comes back over ten minutes later with a $22 bill. They took $10 off.   My girlfriend and I just bust out laughing, we pay the bill and leave, just enjoying the massive humor this place has just provided us for years to come. We spent $70 on bad pickup order and instead of being credited back $70, or at just the $32 to cover our smaller meal this time around, we actually spent more.  TOTAL SHIT SHOW. AVOID.

This is as good as it gets in the car buying world. There is no need to go anywhere else. Its bizarre I did not find this place before, but I can assure you I won't be purchasing a car anywhere else for the rest of my days. Frank is the man. Professional, honest, quick, reliable. No bullshit at all and a superior product at better pricing than larger dealerships. Do yourself a favor and at least let Frank try for your business, it is worth your time.

Some bowls are gonna be better than others due to who makes them, but they are always fire no matter what. Five stars all day. Must be tough for the previous lease holder so see such success when they couldn't pull it off with a somewhat similar idea.
