Echo the comments of others on the complete lack of customer service.  However, this by itself would not necessitate a one star review.    When they "drycleaned" a suit but returned it to me wrinkled I dismissed it as a one-off, despite their total lack of professionalism in the situation.    The final straw was when I asked them to repair a broken zipper.  I begrudgingly paid a "rush fee" despite the fact that it wasn't a rush by any measure.  When I picked up the pants, the zipper didn't work.  I had to bring it in a second time and wait three days.  No surprise, but they refused to refund the "rush fee."

Was there today and the staff made it a pretty miserable experience.    First of all, the food is overpriced and just okay.  Ten dollars for a turkey sandwich and some leaves that didn't do much for me.    But the service was atrocious.  The waiter couldn't have been less interested in his job.  I drank two Arnold Palmers and asked for a third; the third time, he seemed like I'd asked him for a kidney, and said "we don't refill those."  So I could have had 10 diet cokes (or 10 iced teas for that matter) but not another Arnold Palmer?    Second, I had a fifth member of the party join us late.  The waiter advised us to take a chair from a different table.  An old friend sits down and we're getting caught up when the manager comes and makes a huge fuss over it.  If I'm conscientious and ask for permission for something like that, I'm expecting not to get admonished for it ten minutes later.  As we were nearly done with our meal anyway, the manager should have let it go.    Waiter capped it off by twice forgetting a "to go" box, forcing another member of my party to simply give up on bringing their food home.

Total delivery fail.  I'm stuck at home doing work today and can't leave.  I ordered a salad online and was told 45 - 60 minutes.  Fair enough.  An hour and twenty minutes later I call, spend 6 minutes on the phone, and learn that the salad is ready and will be going out soon.  No explanation.  It's still not here.  When the result is waiting 1 1/2 hours for a salad when 60 minutes was the outer end of the delivery time, maybe no explanation would do.  Update: Arrived one hour later than the latest possible time I was quoted at the time of order.  There was no chicken in my chicken caesar salad.  2 hours to move a salad 2 miles and then to get it wrong; this is why Yelp exists.

Update: Went back last night and tried the pizza (chicken pesto).  It was phenomenal.  Same incredibly friendly service.  I will be going back regularly (and looking forward to trying the rest of the menu).    I had the turkey slaw sandwich.  Giant portions, absolutely delicious.  Really cool decor inside.  Friendliest staff you could imagine.  Looking forward to trying the pizza.

This will be an Arcadia staple in no time.    Excellent, healthy food.  Tons of mix and match options.  I had the pho (and substituted chicken for tofu).  It was delicious.  Beautiful space.  Looks gorgeous inside.  Really tasty lemonade and tea made in house.    To think that this was the Blockbuster where I rented DVDs in a time not so remote.  The world moves...
