I love the cheesecake factory! I've been to this location several times. The management is very active and concerned with the individual customer and the food is amazing of course. My mom and I were there on wednesday night, it was busy for a weeknight, but the service was good and the waiter took his time with us. We originally were seated at a small table sandwiched between a group of teenagers and a woman that was (literally) screaming in my mothers ear (I believe she had some old-age hearing loss). I went to the hostess booth and requested to be moved outside, and the hostess moved us without problem.  We ordered the Orange chicken and Bellagio chicken and shared both of them. Both dishes were delicious and distinctive. The portions were big enough to have food left over for the following day. We finished off with Godiva cheesecake and Kaluah cheesecake. Everything was incredible. $72 dollars for two people is not what I would call cheap, but it was an amazing meal and well worth it. :)

My all-time favorite Starbucks!  They always greet you with a smile and wonderful service. Most of the Batista's get my order (which can be a tad picky, I admit) right all of the time; and when it's not, they fix it without hassle or complaint. Love.

The coffee is fine, I stop into this location several times a week simply because I work in this mall...the service however, is slow. They're all (mostly) nice. But it should not take you 10 minutes to give me my grande latte when I'm the only person in the store. Also, I'm in there, as i said, several times a week and I always order the same thing...they have yet to remember me; and I wear a nametag.

I love the chain: The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. The coffee is fresh and smooth and delicious. Any other CB&TL gets 4 to 5 stars from me. However, my experience at this particular store was not good. At all.  My mother and I got out to coffee to catch up several times a week, and we usually go to starbucks. On this particular day we headed to CB&TL for "something new". Since we're not regulars, it took us a minute to order. There was no line, but the barista (guy) was visably irratated and rolling his eyes. I inquired as to whether or not my mother could try a sample of the tea latte to see if she liked it, and while the girl at the register was nice and tried to offer a sample of just the tea, her male coworker interruped and said "no, no we don't" and immediately turned away. The whole experience was less than savory. The cherry on top? The guy was clearly the supervisor.  Great coffee, not so great customer service.

This is clearly the best mall in Arizona. There's just no question. I will agree with everyone else that says: if you wear flip-flops and look like you're going (frankly) "to the mall", everyone will know that you aren't a local. Be prepared to deal with snobby people, they're everywhere. Other then that though, this mall has something for everyone. The Barney's is beautiful, they're upgrading the Victoria's Secret (reopens this summer) and the H&M they put in July 2010 is incredible.

Since there are soo so many long reviews for LUSH, I'll make this quick LOVE LUSH. I'm what you'd call a "Lushie". Bath Bombs=incredible Face masks=indispensable (my fave is BB Seaweed) Toners=sooo refreshing (I keep a small bottle of tea tree in my purse in the summer, a great way to freshen up without messing up your makeup) I would not call it cheap, but it's deffinately worth the money. Also, the sales tactics are somewhat pushy, yes, but it's so much easier to navigate the store with someone by your side!  Ask for samples, they're generous!!

I have searched long and hard for a good salon in Arizona. I told Jenn that I wanted (to go from a deep brunette to blonde) and she delivered. She took her time to make sure that she had a firm grip on what I wanted, and she took her time during the appointment to make sure it was perfect. My hair looks amazing and my friends and co-workers love it. I will deffinately be back!

Love sprinkles! The plain old milk chocolate is my favorite.  & I agree with the several other people who have said it...3.50 for desert is NOT expensive! I could find that change in my couch! :)

Had a great experience here! Their happy hour is unbeatable and the drinks are good. Such a good place to go with the girls for a night out. Also, they have a great sushi selection that includes a number of rolls with NO FISH. That may sound pointless to many of you, but since I am highly allergic, it's refreshing to find a place that I can enjoy with all of my sushi-loving friends.

Old navy... I used to work for this company. There are so many positives behind this brand and its sister brands that I have a hard time writing a negative review now. So let me specify that this review applies exclusively to the Desert Ridge location. The store set up is awful. The stock is seemingly always too low for the square-footage. The visuals look as though there was no thought or effort put into them whatsoever; and today, the service I received while shopping with my mother was atrocious. We found some great deals, made our way over to the registers, and stood there, waiting; just waiting for one of the four associates (two of which I'm positive were managers or leads of some sort) to notice and assist us. There were no other customers. I had to loudly announce our presence; and when a teenage girl finally did meander her way over to us, she was rude and inattentive.  So sad to see such a great company give such a horrible experience. Next time, we'll take our business to the Scottsdale road location.

I really used to love this place...but after coming here on a Saturday night, I kind of hate it. This used to (say 3 years ago) be a laid back, funky and yes, predominately gay place to hang out and have some whiskey-berry sours...now it seems to be overrun with trashy girls in mini-skirts and guys that want to take them home. Sad. And gross.

I love the keg!  I'm a little baffled by the bad reviews, to be honest.  I always get the fillet, and it is impeccable. I do not, as a rule, eat red meat. However, about 3 times a year, I make my way over to the keg and get a delicious steak. The asparagus (one of my absolute favorite underrated vegetables) is always amazing, tender, but never undercooked. Their cheesey-garlic bread is also very good (though the last time my mother was there she said they may have changed the recipe). the staff is a little bit overly attentive at times, but at least my drink is never empty!

You could not pay me to come back. You would think that this club was exclusively for men, based on the ratio of men to women. Also, although it was entertaining to watch drunk people stumble into the pool, it was kind of a hot mess. Yikes.

You could not pay me to come back. I've been 3 times, so it's fair to say that I gave it a chance...always way more guys than girls, very rude bouncers, odd flow with not nearly enough space to dance. Too bad, because it truly is beautiful.

You've got to try their bell peper hummus!!!  I get it to go about once a week.  Also if you're on a budget, get a chicken wrap from their kids menu. Pleanty of food (comes with grilled veggies and a drink) for only 5 bucks!

Ugh. We wanted something low key and simple, so we came here for a "quick" dinner on a Friday night. There was maybe 7 people total dining, the food was SO BAD and our server refuses to bring the cheque. We had to beg it from the manager. Never again.

Every time I come here there is a crazy line at the cash register, with plenty of people on the sales floor that could support. I get that your associates are in zones, but whatever happened to teamwork?? The worst part is the manager walking past, noticing the situation and not helping out this poor cashier.

I really wanted to love this place! The outside was so cute, great bar and patio...the inside got a little confusing with a boxing ring and...shopping?   The drinks: fine, good even, but way overpriced at $12 for weak margaritas.   The food: atrocious. My brisket sliders were 50% fat, my potato "chips" were soggy and the Mac n cheese muffins were in desperate need of flavor.   Also in a really shady neighborhood. Yikes.

I looooove this store! Fashionable clothes at great prices!! I got an adorable bathing suit for 28 bucks total and a dress to wear to a wedding for $25! Yes, the lines are long, but it's worth it.

We loved it. The negative reviews are a bummer because it was so good. Our faves: Gyoza: little dumplings with ponzu sauce and red chili sauce. Yum! Singapore noodles (with chicken): super-flavorful  Malaysian yellow curry: perfect balance of sweet and spice...veggies cooked perfectly Panang curry (my fave!!): the sweetness cuts into the spice. Green beans have never tasted so good. Fair warning, it is SPI-CAAAY! They let you pick 1-10, we went for five and it was really spicy. I can't fathom what ten would taste like.

I've moved away from Az, but this is my "must-go-to" spot whenever I'm in town for work! The Lilikoi Margarita, Crunchy Spicy Chicken Tacos and Jawiaan Jerk Pork plate are all excellent!
