Tried this place out and the food was ok, what concerned me was the cleanliness of the kitchen. The floor was really dirty, under the burners or stove seemed to have months of grease buildup etc. 50c extra to use debit or credit card btw.

So I called and reserved a storage unit a month in advance. Gave credit card # and got a confirmation #. The room was supposed to be available to me today. I called ahead just to make sure everything was set and they tell me they canceled my unit and are now 100% full. I have now spent 4 hours on the phone, Mostly on hold. While also being transferred 7 or 8 times and having to start over with each person. So now I had to go to a storage unit that is 10 miles further away, and I am paying double what they originally told me because each location has its own pricing. Worst customer service I have ever delt with. Bait and switch advertising.

This has been the most unprofessional rude and inconsiderate experience I have had in a long time. I realize each stylist is independent so this refers to Ori Brown. My fiancé and I are getting married and we were referred to Ori to get my fiancé hair and makeup done for the wedding.  After communicating with Ori and agreeing on a price we set a trial date and made a partial payment of almost half what we thought we would owe. Then after finishing the trial run of hair and makeup (which was a subpar job in my opinion) Ori proceeded to tell my fiancé that the final cost would be almost double what she had quoted! Which made us mad of course, but since we had already paid a large portion of it we just let it go. But then after going home a few hours later Ori proceeded to call us and say she had still under quoted us and raised the price again and needed us to come back and make another payment. How you can run a business cheating customers and more than double the price agreed on after payments have been made is beyond me, nor do I understand how sp salon can endorse such an associate.  Not to mention how rude ori was to my fiancé when she tried to ask about it. Needless to say ori will not be doing her hair on our big day!
