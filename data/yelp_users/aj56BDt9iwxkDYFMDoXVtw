THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE PIZZA.   If you have never had a Spinatos Pizza you need to try this place. You will be very impressed.   Great Service!   Great Food!   Great Desserts!   We have been coming here for a while now and cannot get enough of this place, They have a great tasting pie. We usually get a Hawaiian and once you put the first piece in your mouth you cant stop eating it. I highly recommend this place for your next stop. They have 4 locations and all family owned and operated. I have ate a lot of pizza over my time and this the best hands down.   Also try their desserts they were created by the owners wife and are a great compliment to the end of a great meal.   Once you eat at Spinato's you become like family. MMM GOOD!

Great place to get a cup of joe and enjoy the scenery. Love this Place! Just not the smokers. Great customer service and wifi availability. Coffee is average but I love supporting local businesses. I will be back

Always a great place for some coffee and great place to meet new people. The customer service here is outstanding! My drink was a little too sweet. After telling the Barista she offered to top it off with more coffee to accomidate my taste. Prices are average and lake side scenary is fantastic!   This is my favorite Eastside coffee spot!

I am so impressed with the pharmacy staff at this location!! They consistently exceed my expectations. For example, today I went to another Walgreens (Kyrene/Ryan) which never seems to have any of the medications in stock that I need, so I had them transfer my prescription to Rural/Chandler. Crystal the Rx Manager had my prescription bagged and ready for pick-up before I even arrived which was less then a 5 minute drive away. They have done this numerous times for me in the past as well. I have never been in the store only the drive-thru, but the Pharmacy staff is friendly, quick, thoughtful, precise, professional, and knowledgeable!! 5-Stars. I cannot thank them enough for helping my family with our health! They will be my pharmacy of choice for all my prescriptions from now on! :)

You can never have a second chance to make a first impression.  I thought I would try this place out and support my local taco shop. Unfortunately I got screwed!  Ordered a Combo platter and a muchaca taco.m to go. They have me my combo platter w no rice and no beans then handed me bean tostada instead of a muchca taco.   The food was very bland and had no cheese on the enchilada, tacos or the bean burrito.   For a combo plate and an extra taco it cost me $13, I will not be back and only have it 2 stars because I likes the customer service, but the food sucked! Fast food would have been better..

Great value for the money! Cheaper than Main Event. $25 for 2 hours of bowling vs $42 an hour at the Main Event.   Went here with my daughter on a Friday night and had a blast. Only issue I had was lane 10 was super oily! I had to ask for a towel and keep wiping my ball off. Super friendly staff and overall good experience.   We will be back!

While not having reservations on a Saturday night during the BCS Bowl games we were lucky to get a seat. In the bar area. However I had a great view of the 2 plasmas and was able to leave the sports coat in the car.  We had to wait a few moments to get a server, but once we got our server she was FANTASTIC! My wife and I have just gone thru Gastric Bypass Surgery and had a limited amount of choices to make on the menu. We both shared a bowl New England Clam Chowder. Which was THE BEST WE HAVE EVER HAD!!!! Then we ordered from the appitizer menu (Gastric Surgery has it's perks) We decided to try the Chilled Seafood Platter with Lobster,Giant Shrimp,King Crag legs, and Snow Crab. It was so fresh we barley needed any dipping sauce. We also ordered a side of grilled carrots another thumbs up! We ended up filling ourselves and had left overs to take home. Total bill came to $56.93, w Tip! We not only enjoyed the food but the atmosphere and the service. I would like to give Flemings Steak House a 2 thumbs up! Thanks for making our 17th Anniversary one we will never forget.

NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BUY IT'S COVER!   This place may look like a dive from the outside, however the wine burger is DA BOMB!   Had the turkey burger w grilled onions & blu cheese 6.00 and a bowl of chili 2.75. The burger was unreal for not being beef. The chili was a 3 star, but who comes here for the chili?   I have brought several friends here and they all say. It is the best they have ever had at a bar. You cannot go wrong with this place. Compare this place to a Carl's Jr. It will beat it hands down.  If your lucky enough to see the owner (Bill) you will feel like you have known him for years! He is a riot. Lol...  This place is like Cheers where everyone knows your name.....

First the bad: Atmosphere was dark and intimate, however the loud pop music playing in the back round was a bit strange for such a dark and elegant restaurant. We felt like the music belonged in an Applebee's.   The water that was served tastes like it came out of 50 foot garden hose. I would expect at least filtered water in such an upscale place. We had to order a bottle water.   The Good: Menu had a great selection, we chose a $13 salad and a $20 chicken n ribs platter. Then we ordered the clam chowder for an appetizer. Soup was AMAZING! More meat than potatoes. The salad and the dinner entree was a nice size and tasty. We asked ahead for a half order but they would not accommodate :-/  Service was excellent from the moment the doors were opened for us until we left. Waiter was very accommodating and nice.   Overall nice place...

This place is NOT the same!  Paid over $5 for a slice with 4 toppings on it and the box would have tasted better. Next time I'm buying a whole pie at Papa Johns for only $11.00!  I give this place a month :-(

Being new to the Eastside I was looking for a good mechanic and noticed Genes incredible reviews. I have an older Lexus w a power steering leak and trusted Gene to give me a diagnosis of what the issue was. Come to find out it was the rack and pi√±on that needed to be replaced.   I proceeded with the repairs and also added an oil change. Gene installed the rack and noticed the part was defective. He then had to reinstall a new rack. Because the car took longer than expected to be completed Gene resurfaced my front rotars as a courtesy.   Overall we are very satisfied with his honesty and customer service. I highly recommend this shop to others. I will be coming back for my other cars now that I found such a great shop!!!

Went for the crab leg special. Had no idea it was $17.99 a person!!!'  Wow things have really gone up here. The quality of food from the side items to the fried items all were horrible. I have never seen grapes with seeds in them and watermelon that tastes like rhine.  The bathrooms were not too bad, expect for the light switch that hasn't been wiped down in 5 years! I could only imagine that back kitchens sanitary practices are like???   We were served by an American gal, she was point on with drinks dirty plates and crab crackers . If no stars existed I would give this place that, but because our service was good one star remains.

This place looks as plain as the food tastes. I could get a 3 piece meal at KFC with a drink for half the price of what  I paid for lunch here. 14.00 vs 7.00....  Just because it's homemade doesn't make it better....  The only thing good here was the Coleslaw (taste like KFC).  Keep your money and move on. There are plenty of places besides this one that serve much better food and service it's just not Mrs Whites :-(

What to expect when coming here? GREAT HEALTHY FOOD at fair prices. Had the chicken and hummus. It is FANTASTIC!!!!! My wife had the Greek salad and my son had a plain cheese pizza. My son 12 was not so impressed. My suggestion be to just add some pizza sauce to the kids menu pizza. My son thought it was too healthy, but NOT ME! We love this place and will be back..   Don't forget to add some sliced cucumber with the chicken & hummus it goes great together!

First and the LAST time I will go to Brads Place.  Our Uber driver just dropped us off at Brads to enjoy a night of Karaoke. We had 3 couples with us and wanted to have a great night. Went to the bar to order drinks and within 30 seconds the bartender Sarah DENIED service to our girls.  She told us that our girls were way to intoxicated because my wife was stumbling. My wife has a handicap and always walks with a limp and I am absolutely APPALLED to think she was mistaken for being drunk. This was our very first stop of the night and no one even started to drink yet! We then went over to CACTUS JACKS next door and spent well over $300 on food and drinks  between the 4 couples and had a great safe night of fun. Look around Sarah next time before you judge a person. You might just learn something!

Called for a roof repair estimate and trusted the company to do the repairs.   The job came in within budget but also on time. I had Mark do all the work and he was fantastic from finishing the job to stellar results to fantastic follow up on his work.   I would highly recommend this company for your roof repair needs!!

New to the area, I decided to see what this place was about. Great service, wine, and food. A little pricey compared to other Italian eateries around the area (Picazzos,Oregenos,Babbos)   Portions are big, but wish they had half orders to accommodate people with no so much of an appetite.  I wine tasted 3 different red wines before I decided on one. Very accommodating!   Food was very good! I highly recommend the Lasagne it's big enough for two people so I would suggest splitting it.  Overall I give it 4 stars for a great family owned  restaurant. Next time I will come with a bigger appetite! :)

This place rocks for value!!. I just had a California Sub and it was FANTASTIC! extra sweet coleslaw with pastrami stuffed in a fresh yogi roll. I really reccomend this one.  This place is kinda tucked away behind Churches Chicken but way worth the trip. They even have exotic sodas in bottles including REAL DR PEPPER. You should try it sometime. Best of all they now have Pepsi in the Fountain drink. A perfect compliment to an awsome sandwich.  If your on a budget and want to get stuffed come here you won't be dissapointed!

This is the BEST Italian food in town!  Been coming here for years and have tried everything on the Eastside of town. We have taken out of town guests here and even they AGREE!    Every time we come here we always order a take and bake for home after we dine in. This place has got great service, good, atmosphere and great prices.   If you want the best, come try this place. Many yelpers agree. :)

The BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD!  Our first visit to Coach & Willies and it won't be our last!   We had the privilege to be served by Tanya on a Sunday afternoon and the burgers were so good we even tipped the Chef!   We highly recommend this place and happy we tried something new.   Don't forget to try the Lobster Bisque. I'm not a bisque fan but I am now :)

I yelped doggy door reviews and found JGM Pet Doors. Since it had such high reviews I decided to purchase a door from them. I was so impressed with the service!!! The customer service rep ordered the size, inside/outside colors of the door all via the phone. The tech installed the door and nicely packaged the drywall & stucco so that the wall could patch it up later if we wanted too. Our dog loves her new door & we are so impressed by the look & quality of the door that 5 stars is not enough!

After spending $90 for my family to be scared out of their minds. I was the only one scared that I just spent that much money in 15 minutes.  Props were great! Characters were okay but not too scary.   The best money I spent was on drinks at the end. Maybe I should have drank before I went in????   Keep your money and go see something else. Thumbs down for me.

Meet with Dr. Swarnjit Singh for the 1st time I've ever meet with a GI Doctor. Needless to say I walked out feeling as though I've wasted my time & money. He gave me a speech regarding my sensitivity in relations to a fairy tale of the Princess & the Pea. Bottom line I asked to switch doctors at the office, but since he's the senior partner he has a policy that you cannot switch doctors for any reason at their practice even if you are unhappy. This is unbelievable in my opinion, I should be able to choose another doctor if I am unhappy for any reason with the one I was assigned to.  It should not be based on the fact that he is the major shareholder and has his own set of policies which doesn't follow the best practice for patient's rights. I also had to cancel my follow-up appointment to have some procedures done, because he also owns the endoscopy center.  The staff was aware of his unpleasent beside manner and kindly refunded me for the visit and apologized for time I wasted at his office, if only he was as accomidating as his staff was there would not have been any issues.

Great food, service, and ambiance!! Reserved my Birthday for 40 people with Hannah which she coordinated a set menu for our guests to speed up service. From start to finish this was an EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE! Tyler & Jake were our dedicated waiters for the night which didn't skip a beat! Steve the Manager insured me that all would be taken care of and even drove our guests around the lake in the pontoon boat! Spent the entire evening in a private room called the Captain's Lounge which had a fireplace, 2 TV's, pool table, and even a sound system that we connected with our cell phone to keep the guests entertained with our favorite music.   Outside there was plenty of seating on the deck along with darts, cornhole and portable heaters to make everyone feel comfortable. Come around 5pm and wait for an awesome sunset.  The only opportunity we experienced were the bathrooms, several ladies complained that the bathrooms needed attention.   Overall a great experience and we will defiantly be coming back to enjoy this hidden oasis in the desert.

Fantastic honest service and very affordable!   I highly recommend this Father & Son business. Anthony (Son). showed up just an hour and half after I called the SAME DAY! My refrigerator went down and Anthony put my fridge thru a serious of tests. Less than an hour later she up and started working again all for less than $100. I highly recommend these guys too you. Very honest and good :)
