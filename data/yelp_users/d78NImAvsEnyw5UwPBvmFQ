Not a fan, not even a little bit. Underwhelmed by the overall taste and the sauce on the slice, which I think is the most significant ingredient was bland. Not likely to give Ray a chance to make a second impression.

If I could possibly give negative stars, I would. I love a good bargain and unique clothes & am certain you will not find either here. Really tacky clothes & cheap brands selling at 80% what you could buy them for new... I even came across garments that were frayed & holy. Save yourself some time & money & go to Goodwill instead.

Yumm Yumm Yummmm! I just went here for the first time just a few days ago and really liked it. They have a large menu with lots of authentic options. I had a chile relleno which reminded me of the ones my Abuela used to make. Can't wait to return and try more of their enticing options!

For a while now we've been going to Whole Foods to get their gelato & I thought it was time to go directly to the source. Just as delicious if not better here at their shop. My only reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish they had a larger selection of flavors, I'm a big fan of options. For AZ standards this place is primo! Try the buttermilk strawberry! The best strawberry ice cream/gelato I've had ever!

Yummy everytime. The staff here is always willing to help with recommendations(must try the pho), their prices are decent, and the atmosphere is great - all reasons why Xinh Xinh has become one of my favorites.

Great place to go to for those of you with sensitive skin. I had stayed away from waxing for years because it always left my surrounding areas embarrassingly red and bumpy. I had done my research on this place and they use different type of wax, that makes ALL the difference! The only bad thing I could say about this company as a whole is that not all esthiticians are created equal, I went to another location(Arrowhead) before moving to N. Scottsdale and left with unpleasantly thin eyebrows! ):  Ask to see Brandy here, she did mine recently and did a great job! Also, she recommended a regrowth product that they have because I mentioned my encounter with the brow butcher and a week later, I am seeing great results! Super Exciting!!!

Today was my second visit to the Tavern to catch some football and food with friends. My first experience was just okay, I don't want to be entirely negative so I'll admit the veggie burger that I ordered on my first visit was really good and made in house. My experience today however will not likely secure a third visit. My friends arrived before me so luckily I didn't have to wait. I did however feel sorry for those who did since there's not really any "waiting area", people were standing in the entrance door trying to catch glimpses of the game. My beer was served warm which is a sin in my opinion, my pizza was very salty which made it hard to eat which sucked because I was hungry. The absolute worst part of this experience was the smell/smokiness - I felt like I was in a small room next to a gigantic deep fryer. I'm not sure if it was the location of our table or what??? I wasn't the only one that noticed it. It was unappetizing to say the least & I couldn't wait to get out of there. Not returning anytime soon.

I came here this past weekend while we were in Vegas celebrating my birthday. We had a dinner reservation for a party of 10 and after a long day at the pool and drinking everyone was running late. They were very accomodating and held our table while our party trickled in. The service was great and the food was fabulous! Absolutely loved everything we ordered. The veggie pizza with truffle oil was great, I've been craving it since I had it and the caesar salad was superb! I will definitely be visiting this place everytime I'm back in LV.

I wanted to like this place, I really did. I had a super craving for mexi-food and unfortunately where I live(N. Scottsdale) doesn't have too many authentic options. I have grown up eating mexican food from my own nana's,  & my tia's, prima's, nino's... (you get the idea) so I consider myself an accredited taco critic. I ordered an asada and a fish taco, which also came with rice and beans. The rice was the best part of this meal. The fish was unidentifiable and very mushy, it came grilled(? I'm not even sure). I took maybe two bites and that was it, salsa couldn't even save this. I personally prefer the baja style and would recommend rubio's or basically any other place for fish tacos, unless you like canned tuna fish in a corn tortilla. I'd also like to throw out there I thought their salsa lacked flavor and was watery! Ugh!!! Tragic!!! The carne asada was only slightly better it came out room temperature and had an odd smoky flavor. I'm all for grilling food but I get the feeling this carne had maybe been grilled a day or two before and reheated? However, my boyfriend had an asada burrito and his carne was considerably better. All in all a disappointing experience and I will not be coming back. I am curious as to how this place was chosen to be featured on Food Network?! Hopefully for their sake this was just a bad day for them and they step their taco game up. As for me, my venture for great tacos is aimed further South (:

Dined here this past Friday night... We showed up a little past 8pm and were seated right away, and as if that weren't lucky enough we got a great table on their charming lil patio. I had high expectations for this place as the owners here are the same as my beloved Postino's. The food was great and did not disappoint. Their wine menu contained great options and the food menu contained alot of unique dishes, which I dig. I chose the mixed grain salad which was perfect, seasonally fresh items which all blended very nicely. The boyfriend had their burger and mac and cheese which I could tell he genuinely enjoyed, which is not easily accomplished. We passed on dessert this time, but I've had a Churn red-velvet ice cream sandwich before and it was uhhhmazing! We will definitely be returning here soon! (:
