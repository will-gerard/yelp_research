Came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in NYC's Chinatown. I know it's really not fair to compare this place with what we had in NYC, but I definitely left disappointed.   The service was lightening fast, but there was definitely the feeling that we received different service since we weren't Asian. For example, soup dumplings are pretty impossible to eat without the small porcelain spoon, but we received no utensils to eat them with at all.   The eggplant was good, but was saltier and more sour than I was expecting. My mother said that her duck was pretty dry despite the copious amount of sauce on the plate.   Overall, I would say good effort for Phoenix, but I won't be returning.

Professional, safe, and clean shooting range.  I've been coming here with my dad for a few years now, and it's always been a great experience. It only takes a few minutes to get set up with everything to rent time in a lane, and the service is always great!   You can rent many different guns or bring your own, and they have many different targets for purchase which can be fun. I usually get the typical silhouette, but every now and then the zombie target can be fun.     They also have Ladies nights (I think on Tuesdays) when women can rent lanes at a discounted price.

I've loved Lola's since it was located on Central, just south of Camelback. The newer location (Roosevelt and 3rd) is a bit smaller, but the quality of the coffee and snacks is still always excellent.   Their iced tea is excellent, but I'm always a sucker for their Matador - a mocha with cinnamon syrup that is out of this world good. They don't always ask you if you want whipped cream, but you're really missing out on something special if you don't get it!   Parking can be a challenge, but if you drive a but north in the lot, you can park in the covered garage which is only for customers of the spots in the area.
