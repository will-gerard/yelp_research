John was fantastic and knew exactly what to do with my hair and eyebrows. He was very detailed in shaping my brows and cutting my hair. I'm the type of person that tells the stylist to do what looks best and going to an Asian salon, it's obvious that they know what they're doing! $24 for a haircut and eyebrow wax? Can't beat that. Definitely will be returning.  They have a bit of Asian mom personality where they tell you what will look best in you and some people may be turned off by that, but I appreciate it and find humor in it.

I needed to have my car repaired because the check engine light was on and I'm due to emissions and registration.    Carter is the one who deals with the calls, the work, everything.   He came out with a truck to my condo and worked on my car right then and there.  He is very professional and friendly.  He is honest and explains things regarding the car, without just fixing things or diddling with things and then giving you a bill.  His prices are extremely reasonable and it is obvious that he enjoys what he does and genuinely wants to help people with their car problems and help them understand what's going on for future reference.  I would highly recommend him.  He was honest, reasonable in price (cheap!), and educational.

I agree with the first review on here.  I had a terrible experience with this company.  I purchased the vouched from AMAZON because I trust AMAZON and thought this would be a reputable merchant to use and the deal was good.    When I called to schedule and book for the moving, the manager, who stated that his name was Al Sagi, was incredibly rude to me and unprofessional.  He took all of my information, then proceeded to tell me that I would owe an extra $104, which he was giving me a discount from $140 for 4 pieces of furniture that were over 100lbs.  I told him that I did not understand how they could make the assumption that the couch we have was 100lbs and charge me for that.  He then countered and stated that they could instead bring out scales, weigh everything, and set up a price that way, but it would be more expensive.  I said I didn't want that, but he wasn't explaining properly why they are allowed to make assumptions that something is over 100lbs and charge people for it.  He then asked me if I could move the couch.  I said of course not... to which he laughed at me for.  Then I stated that it was not a matter of me not being able to move/carry the couch because of its weight, but because it is long and requires 2 people to move it.  Also, I would not be calling a moving company to be asked if I can move things myself.    He continued to chortle and argue about the price and told me that if I was dissatisfied with them, I could go to another agency and take my business elsewhere.  I told him that he was being unprofessional and rude by laughing at me and the tone he was using.  To this, he stated that he has never been called rude before and stated that he wasn't laughing at me, that he was just a happy man and that it is not a problem to be happy.  There was no ownership of his fault, rudeness, and lack of professionalism.  When I asked to speak to his boss, he only gave me a first name and refused to give me his number.  When I asked for the address of the office to speak to his boss, he gave me cross streets.  He finally gave me the address and the owner's last name, but again refused to give me his phone number.  When I asked when he would be in the office for me to speak to him, he stated, "He's the boss.  He's busy.  He's in and out".  So there is no way to make a complaint to the boss and if you do with "Al", the manager, he'll just laugh at you.  He again told me that he was giving me a discount and I should be happy with it and that if I wasn't, I could take my business elsewhere.  Then he asked me what I wanted to pay.  I told him that our couch is not 100lbs and I was not interested in paying for it when it would not be under the qualifications for a price of $35 extra.  He then accepted, in a brief manner asked me if I was finally satisfied and gave me a booking number.  I called AMAZON and cancelled the voucher.  I called the company and no one answered, so I left a voicemail to cancel the booking.  I have never been spoken to in such a manner and have had a company member laugh at me various times facetiously the way he did.  There were no apologies for his rudeness, he just tried to defend himself and then became brief with me.  Luckily, AMAZON is an amazing company and let me know that they take the feedback and contact the agency to see what happened and if they continue to have issues with them, they will no longer use them as a merchant.  I am glad that at least someone takes accountability for poor customer service.
