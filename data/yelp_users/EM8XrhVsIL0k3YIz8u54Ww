I have been a big fan of Oregano's in the past, but today i went there for lunch and tried their Pablo picasso salad. the chicken was so dry and the lettuce i think they forgot to dry off the water because it was swimming in its own pool of juices. Not that big of a deal. Nobody's perfect all the time. i sent it back and the manager came over and asked if i wanted something different since i did not like the salad (started out very nice) i really wanted that salad. he informed me that this is the way the salad comes and if i did not like it to get something else, and better yet eat somewhere else. i was in a state of shock for a moment and took the advise of going somewhere else. I will go back to Oregano's just not the Old Town location.

Wow that is what i call a carne asada taco, plus i had my first $3 marg that you can actually taste the tequila in. Wow! Chips where nice and hot had to salt then of course so i can drink faster. Salsa was good, did not like the green one though, red one had plenty of flavor asked for the hot sauce to heat it up. The Carne Asada was actually real steak. Nice! will be back for sure, rumor has it the have taco specials tomorrow too.
