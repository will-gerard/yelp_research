I really like this place. They have awesome waitresses; they're always so nice and sweet to us when we come in. I love that it's a diner and it hits the spot when I have a mad craving for breakfast food. I love getting their country fried steak, which is like twice as big as the portion sizes you can get at the other places, like Denny's and such. Their serving sizes here are huge in general. The cinnamon bun, which is delish with the melted butter, is pretty big; it looks like it's be as big as one of my jazz hands. The fried chicken is yummy although, I don't really care for their veggie sides cause they're over cooked and all the goodness seems to be gone. I think that's my only complaint about the place.

Sky Harbor has always been an easy airport to get in and out of. It's pretty much a giant loop. And since the renovations and whatnot, it looks awesome. They've even changed up the signage, making signs bigger and brighter. The layout of the airport is people friendly; one can navigate their way fairly easily through it. The people are friendly, and they have a decent selection for food, probably more so when some of the local restaurants are going to open in the airport.

I've been to quite a few buffets and this one was actually pretty decent in comparison to the ones I've been to. This one does have an okay sushi bar; the sushi is made to order rather than just sitting there, waiting for people to pick them up. There is quite a bit of food selection here. My favorite part of the buffet is the Mongolian stir fry just because I love my noodles made to order and their grill was one of the better ones in a buffet that was decent.

Love this place. It's yummy, cheap and the portion sizes are huge. I usually get the same thing even though I tell myself to try something new, but I can't help myself lol. I forget the number, but it's the one with noodles, pork, egg roll with veggies :P I tend to get the same meal every time I try a new Vietnamese place to try and gauge how I like it before I stray to something new. I failed to do so a few times and I ended up unsatisfied lol. Yes, the place looks sketchy, but it's yummy!

I really love this place. The staff is great, the drinks are great and it's a great place to hang out with friends or study. The location is really awesome, being right next to a lake. You can sit there and enjoy or you can take your coffee and take a nice lil stroll around the lake. This place is one of the few places that make my soy caramel macchiato right - it's not too sweet and it's mixed just right. Their Italian sodas are also really yummy; I love the deadly one. And what's better to go with your coffee than a pastry? I love getting a slice of baklava to go with my yummy coffee. That combo is a perfect start or end to my day :)

I do love this store. It's now Sprouts so yay! I love that when they have a wide array of things when some places don't seem to have them. I love the variety of the fresh fruits and veggies! Their deli meat is yummy. The staff is friendly. This location is clean and well lit and spacious and always stocked with what I'm looking for. It's one of my go-to's when shopping for my week's food.

I went with my friends for brunch New Years and this place was nicely packed, the wait wasn't that long. I ordered the Whole Hog omelette and it was good and meaty. It was a huge portion size; I couldn't finish the whole thing. The Bar Harbour flapjacks were really delicious too with their berry puree to top it off. My friend got the Bird, the other omelette I was thinking about ordering, and he gave me a taste of it and I knew I should have ordered that. It was really good. I'll be sure to order that next time I go there.

Taking a break from the Old Town Scottsdale club scene and trying the other bars in the area had me going to the Rusty Spur Saloon. And I must say, I loved the place. The bar decor is that awesome cowboy look. It was a small place and yet they still managed to fit a band in there along with some seating. I don't know how but they did lol. The drinks were good and cheap and it's a great alternative to the usual scene.

This place is too cute. All the pink, the Family Circus comics, and the throwback to the old school soda parlors makes the atmosphere and ambiance of this place. I've been going here for a while. I remember my pre-21 nights when I would venture out with friends for a late night treat. The place, on the weekends, would be open till midnight. I love their ice cream, I will get my mint chocolate chip ice cream to go. I also really love their Top Hat and Tin Roof Sundaes.

Love this place to get my late burrito fix. I especially love it after a night out. The place is awesome. Yes, it's greasy but it's yummy. I know, bad, but like I said, yummy. The portion sizes at this place are huge and their food is pretty cheap. I like getting my carne asada burritos as well as a California burrito. I also really enjoy their carnitas burrito, thanks to my friend Jason, and I do like their chorizo burrito when I get in the mood for a breakfast burrito.

The place is awesome. Love that its a dive! It's close to Old Town's douche baggery, but still far enough. The place is laid back with some awesome beers. There's a pool table and the patio is heated during the colder months. And the people that stroll in there are a good mix.

Love this place. And it's so close to home! I love their selections of beers! I love that the servers there are so knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to trying to figure out what beer I want. Thanks to all the random samples, I've expanded my favorites to not only include their orange blossom, which by the way taste like an orange creamsicle, but their hefeweizen. Their food wasn't anything exciting, just good to nosh on while you get your drink on. Since they've changed up their layout, adding more space and tables, it makes it easier to find tables. The other patrons are cool and chill. It's an awesome place to go to and spend any night in :)

I use to be a Los Betos girl, but I have converted over to Super Burrito lol. I still like them, but I find that Super Burrito has more choices and they have things available 24/7. Los Betos no longer has some of their breakfast items available past a certain time as they once did. And they don't let one do some changes to some of their orders the way they do at Super Burrito. And their churros are yummy along with their tongue tacos. I really dig their Arizona quesadilla. For some reason, I find it better as a quesadilla than as a burrito. It's a good place when it's late and you're fiending for some food.

I ordered delivery from here recently and was pleasantly surprised. I had read previous reviews that had me putting off ordering from here. But, when I was moving and had nothing to cook with or eat with since it was packed up, I ordered from here. And the delivery time was about on par for other places. It was a bit busy when I ordered, given it was right around lunch time. But when it was delivered, it was still hot and yummy. The volcano chicken, one of their lunch specials was good; it came with rice and crab puffs. The happy family was good as well. This is a place I'd order from again. Oh and I did like the fact that when you get delivery and use card, they bring the card reader with them rather than giving my card number over the phone.

I really am a fan of this place. It has good food and good beer, and also is associated with some good memories here. This place is a great place to come to and watch a game or two. Or in our case, a great place to come to after watching out team win or lose the game. The parking here can be difficult since there is no lot or anything designated for costumer parking. The beer is really good here. I like the lighter beers, such as their regular peach beer, but their other beers and seasonal are awesome too. The food is delish; I always get a hankering for their beer battered fries. Eat it with their jalape√±o ranch sauce and it's perfect. That and some loaded chicken nachos are easily split between friends; their portion sizes are fairly huge. It's really an awesome spot to get together with friend, have a pint, enjoy a game and some good food.

This place is awesome. I stumbled upon this gem when I was googling a comic shop. It had been a while since I've been to one and I have been nostalgic of the days when I read more graphic novels as they're now called, making it okay to indulge in my geek comic book side.   I went on a Saturday night and to my surprise, they're open quite late. And apparently, they have a tourney there, which apparently goes on every weekend. I went on a weekend when they were slow, which was still fairly busy, considering it was a Saturday night. Anyways, they had quite a selection of the fan favorites and a few other ones that aren't so mainstream, but awesome finds.   I was looking for a series in particular, which they didn't have, but the staff told me they could order them for you which is awesome. And, also, they were able to suggest a few, which was awesome, being out of the "scene" for a while. I love this place and it's a good place to get my comic book geek on.

If I knew vegan food was this fantastic, I'd totally convert and be a Vegan. I recently went to Green out in South Scottsdale and I have been trying to eat my way through the menu.   For their starters, I've tried the samosa, the chili fries, the egg rolls and "wings." Out of those, I'd say my favorites have been the wings. If you didn't know they were mock meat, I'd still think they were just like boneless pieces of chicken cause the sauce with the wings was fantastic. And the chili fries were fantastic! I usually get the chili on the side to avoid making the thyme fries too soggy.   I've only done two of the bowls - the drunken mushroom chicken and the diablo red with mock beef. The two bowls were seasoned fantastically and yummy. I do need to try more bowls. I've tried more of the sammies and burgers. The original "g"spicy po-boy is fantastic, but I may be biased since I really loved the wings and that's what they put in this po-boy lol. I tried their no-harm parm chicken sandwich, but wasn't that big of a fan of it, but it was because my mock chicken patty and its breading was coming off and apart due to the tomato sauce so it wasn't enjoyable. My favorite by far was the Mexicali burger; it's a fantastic, slightly spicy, mouthful. As I've said, I'm trying to eat my way through the menu, but I couldn't pass up having another mexicali burger again lol.   The tSoynamis, their ice cream dream desserts, are a simplistic tasty orgasmic mouthful. The have specialty ones featured off their usual menu; I love their recent one with the butterfingers. It's so yummy and makes me want a butterfinger lol. Their Soy Captain tSoynami makes me want Captain Crunch. Their Cookies 'n' Cream and Ts'more tSoynami is yummy as well. The Cookies 'n' Cream one is a chocolatey heaven. They have an awesome PB&J tSoynami, which is by far my favorite!   I am so going back and making a dent in their menu!

Love this place. I always tell myself to eat my way through their menu but I never do. I always get the same thing I usually do, which is the chicken shawarma plate. I love it! I get my hummus & pita fix as well as the always yummy garlic sauce on the chicken. I try and get extra garlic sauce with mine :) Get extra pita cause they do give a good serving of hummus. Also, the rice is yummy, although last time I was there, the rice was different than usual.

I love this place. They have a large selection of fabrics, ribbons, and other paraphernalia one would need for an arts and crafts project. I usually hit up this place when I want to make a skirt or curtains or pillows or make book covers. I find it way cheaper than some of the other chains and a way better selection. You could spend the whole day going through all the piles and find something you'd like and probably then some. The costumer service is usually really good. The people there are helpful but a few can be a bit "crotchety" or have those kinds of moments, but that's been rare in my experience.

I have to say, I really liked this place. It's a convenient location on the strip. It's not too bad on the price front. It's connected to the tram system. The room was a good a decent size; there were four of us in a 2 queen bed room. It didn't have an amazing view, but it was decent. The food court was standard; I appreciate that they had Subway as a choice rather than just things like McDonalds. There were other places to eat in the hotel, but I didn't get to try those out.   There are a few bars as well, not a surprise there, but I did have my own personal favorite one, the Ignite Lounge. It was favorite because there were awesome bartenders that got to know me and always had awesome drinks. I would just say, "Make me something strong and fruity," my standard order, and they would come back with something new and yummy. And they got to know me and my friend and would look out for us.    Also, I have to say, I enjoyed their pool scene as well. It's not a pool party that one can get at places like Wet, EBC or Rehab. But it's not bad; it's chill and there's still a good mix of people there.

Delux has expanded their menu as well as added sushi to their repertoire. And can I just say, "Holy hell there were a lot of menus that got dropped down on our little two top of a table" lol.   I tried their Samba roll; it was alright, nothing to write home about. The Vegas room was okay - it was a standard Vegas roll. The fries, the one thing I remember being awesome at the place was alright. Maybe I built it up in my mind and it didn't live up to the hype or perhaps it really wasn't super awesome as I once thought it was. The lobster bisque was good. Didn't have that finish that Wild Fish had, but it was still pretty good. I really appreciate that they have local brews available cause who doesn't love Papago's Orange blossom?   Now onto dessert - had a sample of their some pie and their peanut butter cookie which was chewy but not like undercooked or anything. It was a good finish rather than a full dessert. Topped with ice cream was just extra yummy. The apple pie was okay, but you really need the ice cream to combat the top of the pie. The crust under the filling, which has all the yummy flavorful goodness is better and not so dry. Both desserts are a good size and perfectly capable of being split between two people.  I'd come here again and give the sushi more of a chance cause I do love the burgers here.

So not impressed. If I wanted to spend this much on brunch, I would've gone somewhere better, but no, the people in the group wanted this place. I think we should've questioned her taste buds since she was slightly sick/congested.   The place had different stations. There was American, Mexican, Italian, Asian, a Salad station, Seafood, Desserts, and MIddle Eastern, which included Indian food because apparently India is not Asia according to Planet Hollywood.   The line was quite long, but it was around brunch/lunch so my party and I waited in line, which didn't seem that long of a wait. Or maybe it didn't seem that long since they had TVs playing a Nets game and people were all about Lin, but I digress. Once we paid, the total came to $31, we had to wait to be seated, which again didn't seem so long a wait. We marked out drink orders on a paper and went off in search of belly fulfilling food. I got the usual breakfast food: eggs benedict, bacon (a lot of it since I don't really eat bacon lol), as well as some fruit and harsh browns. Another plate contained stuff from the Middle Eastern station, like some chicken curry, basmati rice, their lamb stuffed tomato thing, and pita and hummus. Well have to say, I enjoyed the breakfast stuff, aside from the non-runny eggs benedict and was kinda disappointed in the Middle Eastern station. I found the food at that station a bit bland and asking "Where is the spice that makes this whatever it is suppose to be?!"   Luckily there were drinks, although the OJ was a bit warm for my liking. And the mimosas were more like an Orangina than a mimosa. We asked for water, but that didn't come till later. I almost thought the poor server forgot. Anyways, I went back to the buffet to see what else I could eat. I didn't find much too appealing cause I was a bit full, but I soldiered on. I went back for a crepe which was at the dessert station. They didn't have any strawberries (big boo to that!!!) so I settled with cherries topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and powdered sugar. I found it a bit blah; too chocolatey and the cherry filling was a bit off putting for me.   I got another fruit of plate and found I was more satisfied with fruit than I was with anything else. I could've gotten it and a decent mimosa somewhere else or found better food at other buffets on and off the strip. Aside from the fruit, I liked the cotton candy :)  I like buffets in Vegas, but not this one.

I recently went here for brunch/lunch with my mom since I eat at the Chelsea's airport location quite a bit. I always hear from people at the airport that the street side location is so nice and I have to say I agree. It's so pretty, the layout and the patio area was gorgeous the day we went since the weather cooperated. Since the street side location has more items than the airport, I decided to venture to give them a try, such as the lobster slidersand the mac and cheese, both items that I wish were available at the airport cause they were delicious. The service was awesome; the staff were really friendly.  Next time, I totally need to try the veggie tacos or the tuna burger. My mom liked her Howie burger and I told her to get it with the kale slaw, but I ended up eating her kale slaw and she had to get a side order of fries lol. I really wanted to do dessert, but that didn't happen cause I should have known better; I should have known to leave room for dessert. I know, I was a ditz that day and wasn't thinking, but next time I'm all over it.

Zuma is a seemingly fun happening place on Mill. I've been to Zuma a few times in the past and have never really cared for it. And I have yet to find a reason as to why it seems to always be packed. The smokers' patio in the front must be why it always seemed packed thereby giving off the illusion that it's packed because at times, when you get past the packed smokers' patio, and actually enter the bar itself, it's dead.  Given, they have some decent music and they have drink special that aren't that bad, but the atmosphere and the people aren't enough to overcome their shortcomings. The crowd there seems to be trying a bit too hard to be something they obviously are not. The girls are trying a bit too hard and end up seeming classless. For The men, well can anyone "Tool Academy, future class of ..."? Actually, the students of Tool Academy might be a step up from the men that seem to gravitate to and work at Zuma. The bartenders are a bit of an ass hat, what with their superior attitude and their less than superior looks. You think if they'd be trying to imitate a Scottsdale feeling, the tool of a bartender would at least mix like one and look like one if they insist on wearing those tight V neck tees. Their mixing abilities, not the best. I get my usual mixed drink and it wasn't up to par as it is in some other places.  The only way to survive this place is if you're already drunk.

I really like this place. It's always a fun time when we go out here. Since I first went there way back when, it was tiny and cramped, but since then, they're redone their layout, such as their bathroom and dance floor area. Also, they're extended their patio areas which is fantastic. Love the fact that they have yummy 2-4-1 drinks with the use of their poker chips. I have a few saved so when I need a night out and can't afford it, I use my chips! :) I love the music; they have a DJ and they play music videos that are always fun to dance to and watch as well as the cute go-go dancers lol.

Love this place! It's a great change from the usual Old Town vibe. You can wear whatever; you don't need to be dressed up or for the dudes, douch-tastic. The crowd is awesome and the drinks are cheap and yummy. If you check in on some of the apps, you can find cheap drink specials. And girls: awesome tip - the bathroom mirrors are fantastic! I always go check myself out there lol.

Love the central location in Old Town. The place is clean and quite for the most part. They have a decent book/movie selection and what they don't have, you can try to reserve it or get it from one of their other branches or from the Phoenix library or even from some of their online libraries. You can get their e-books sent to your Kindle. Parking is easy since there's a garage. In the garage are the book return bins, so that makes returning things after-hours easy as well. The staff is helpful and nice. It's a nice place to come study or just hang out and read.

Love the G-Spot. I like gelato in general just cause I don't feel so bad when I start fiendin' for some chocolate. And The Gelato spot is as good as it gets. I like the variety of flavors they offer. And if you're wondering what it'll taste like, you can always get a sample. You can mix and match all the flavors as much as you want. I really like the snickers gelato flavor with some mint chocolate chip. Just writing this review makes me want to get some lol. I love this location; being on the corner and on Scottsdale Rd, it makes it perfect to sit and people watch. It's really great for grabbing dessert after dinner or if you just want some sweet yummy goodness.

I love this place. It's way better than the chains in Cali. I love their BBQ sauce and their curry chicken katsu is yummy. And I love their mac salad. The mini portions are not really mini, at least for me. It's a fairly big portion size. I will make the short trek out here when I get the craving for Hawaiian BBQ. The others aren't as awesome as this place :)

I really like the boba here. They have an extensive menu, full of different boba flavors and different ways to get it. I like my taro and getting taro is usually my way to judge a boba place. The taro here wasn't too sweet and had enough of the taro flavor to make it yummy. The place also had nice little snack foods like fries and calamari, which aren't bad. I make it a point in stopping by here when I get a boba craving.

I've had better than this place. Yes it had unlimited sushi and other seafood, but the rest of the food was not bad but not good. I found that the only "highlight" was the dessert selection. I really wouldn't go back unless someone else paid.

I have to say I have a love/hate relationship with the hotel room mirror. It makes a girl look slim and on point, but when you get out of there and look into a regular mirror, you can't help but thing, "WTF was I thinking when I was getting ready?" lol.  That aside, PH was pretty awesome. It's a great location, there's a good crowd there. The Miracle Mile Shops were a fantastic place/temptation and there was a wide array of restaurants to go to. The staff were really helpful. The room we stayed in was the Donnie and Marie room; it was great, aside from the mirror. The bathroom was fabulous with their double vanity, one on each side of the bathroom. The room was spacious; it had two queens and room for a sleepaway bed. And speaking from experience, the chairs in the room are super comfy, comfy enough to sleep in. The view from our room was Paris and Bellagio fountains so that was pretty sweet :) The elevators were always pumping music I wanted to sing along and dance too so that was also fun lol. Another sweet perk of staying here: Earl of Sandwich lol. I love it so much that I started my day there and ended my day there lol. I'd stay here again just for the convenience of having them in the hotel lol.  I think the only thing I didn't really care for was the parking or trying to get to it. There's no entrance from the strip, you have to go onto Harmon I believe to get to the parking, valet and cabs. Their buffet was all right, but for the price you pay, you can get better food at the other places on the strip. Also in the elevators, they have their screens not on the side or above the panel; they have it on the roof. I didn't care for that either. I didn't get to check out Gallery so I can't comment on their nightclub.   Overall, I liked it. I'm a fan and I'm staying there again for my b-day weekend!

Have to say I love love love this place. It was so yummy. And cheap! And quite hefty! Where can you get that on the strip?! It's the perfect cure to a hangover, at least it was for me, and it's the perfect thing to eat after a night out. I tried their Full Montagu and their Club. I have to say they were yummy in the tummy goodness. It's their bread that makes it so awesome! If I didn't do breakfast at the buffet there, I would've just asked for their bread toasted lol. Also, their desserts are yummy. I was eyeing their sweet cream brownie and was not going to get it cause I'd rather save my calories for my drinking, but my friend got one and I decided to have a piece and it was so yummy that a piece ended up being like half the brownie lol. I will so need to go here every time I'm in town after a night out :P

I really like this place. My food was not disappointing. I've had their tortas, specifically their Ranchera de pollo and their Torta Nortena de pollo. I liked that there was a slight bit of heat, not enough to send one running for water and not too little that one would want to douse their tortas with hot sauce. Their tortas are served with a side of potato chips. The tortas are a good size. I can finish a whole one when I'm starved, but otherwise, I take half and save it for later since the serving size was a bit much for me. Next time, I totally need to get some sopes since i have yet to find a good place yet and need to check out their Lengua torta. I have to also mention their aguas cremosas, which are delish; it's a yummy drink/dessert. Also, the staff was nice, the prices were good and its a clean lil place.

This place is ok at best. I can see why people would like it - it's only good during like happy hour. The food was all right. The Drinks were all right. The service was all right. There really wasn't anything awesome about this place that would make me rave about it or go out of my way to go there.

I never knew this place was here until my friend brought me here. I'm an anti-Starbucks girl and I'm a bit picky when it comes to my coffee places, but this place was really good. And I really like their chai and I'm not one for chai, or maybe it's just Starbucks chai. This place is deceiving; it looks tiny from the outside, but when you go in, it's bigger than it looks. The artwork that adorns the space is really cool and interesting. I just wish this place was open later.

When I am craving really awesome fish and chips, this is the place to go. Especially on fridays, where their fish and chips is all you can eat! Although, be warned that the fish and chips servings are huge so come super hungry lol. And Fridays, they have some live music adding to the awesome vibe of the place. It's an awesome cool place to have a drink and get my fish and chippies on :)

This is a good place to start the week for the Sunday Rock Garden night. It's basically happy hour, but it last all day :). I really love this place. I've become a Sunday HH regular here. I can't believe I didn't go here sooner in my whole time living here. The house rolls were half off, appetizers were half off, and the drinks were half off as well.  My favorites here: For the signature drink there, and I did a fair bit of sample them, was the Blue Berrymore. It was a nice drink on a nice summer day. I enjoy their house rolls. The Geisha A Go Go roll was delicious, wrapped in their "Geisha Green" soy paper with a jalapeno sauce. The Gaijin roll, a specialty roll here, was yummy. It was an interesting take on a chimi, topped with their chipotle sauce made it super yummy. I really enjoyed the calamari here, again paired with the chipotle sauce for dipping, and the teriyaki ribs, which were so good and tender. The fried rice is really yummy as are their other apps. The ones I mentioned are just my favorites and ones to try. The apps here are a good portion size, unlike some other places, where you can actually share with people.   It's a good place for food and the environment is really awesome! There's an awesome DJ mixing fun music, nice eye candy. It's a good place all around :)

Been to Pearl a few times now. And it's always been during their happy hour. I have to say that their happy hour is pretty great. I think I've had a good few items off their happy hour menu and they were delicious. The Korean pork tacos were yummy along with their signature rolls. I particularly like their fish shtick.  And their bombers are pretty delish too. My favorite is cluster bomb. The vibe of the place is pretty awesome and it's a good place to go out to whether is be for happy hour or a place to go to before a night out. It is in Old Town and in the same area as Jackrabbit.

Love that they have a variety of beauty products. I know that between Ulta and Sephora, I can usually find what I'm looking for. I have to say that their customer service leaves something to be desired. I had to look for someone for a while but when I did find someone, they were super helpful and knowledgeable.

I have to say, I'm use to clubby/bar scene of Old Town and that's usually what one thinks of when they think Old Town, but venturing south of Indian School in Old Town is a whole other vibe and discovering the Old Town Tavern has me loving Old Town for more than just the club scene. I love that it's more laid back, the people are awesome, the bartenders are speedy, and the drinks are cold. I really dig the place.

Pros: I have to say, I was surprised with the Tropicana rooms. I wasn't expecting them to be as big as they were. I went with a friend and we were in a 2 queen room. And there was still plenty of space, even after we scattered our things about as we seem to do. And it was a room with a view of what was once Club Nikki/Nikki Beach.   The casino didn't smell of smoke as most of the casinos seem to. It smelled of something else, which to me, was a good thing, but a bad thing for my friend; I think the smell made her allergies act up. There was a good amount of food places on the way to the rooms, so that was convenient, as well as the coffee place right at the elevator bay and the 24-hour Starbucks and food court. Their food court was not the usual, with McDonalds and Pizza Hut or whatever they have. They had their own menu and was better than a run-of-the-mill food court.   Con: Self park is a bit far from the front desk. And the front desk is a bit far from the rooms. The walks to the cabs and the rooms were horrible, especially in high heels and sober - You girls know what I'm talking about lol.

I love Mojo. And this location is great when you're out at the Tempe Marketplace and you have a craving for fro yo. Like their other location, they have awesome flavors and toppings. You can't really go wrong at Mojo, whichever location you go to.

Mojo made me fall in love with fro yo. I love Mojo's Twitter Tuesdays where you can get half off of your fro yo. The location is awesome; I can go to Mojo between classes. It's here where I found my love of the pomegranate & acai flavors as well. They have awesome seasonal flavors as well as the other usual staples. I love their different toppings and it's a good place to hang out with friends and get your Mojo on :)

So I have to say, for the most part, I like this gym. I like the array of classes they offer and they do have special class events as well. Although, I wish they had more during the weekends. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hours are awesome cause it lets someone like me and my erratic sleep schedule get in at random times of the day/night to get my workout on. It does get busy at the predictable times and you can have to wait for some machines when that happens. But I find that when that happens, I can just go grab free weights.  I did notice that they changed the layout a bit in one area (I don't know when that happened, maybe I just lack powers of observations since I usually go for classes and then I chuck those deuces) and I have to say I'm not a fan of that. I am already self conscious when I'm at the gym so to have me doing my floor work and ab work in front of people using machines is something I don't love.

i love this Yogurtland due to its proximity to home and school as well as the price. Yes, I know Mojo's is closer to ASU, given it's on Mill, but this place is cheaper than Mojo's and I do love the flavors they offer and their toppings. I always have to be on the look out for my favorite, pomegranate raspberry tart, which I usually mix in with some other flavor I feel like. And then I top it off with my strawberries, almonds, yogurt chips and sprinkles. All of which costs me like $4! I love it! I love this place. And I've tried different places, but this is still my fave.

I love yogurtland, at any location. I like this one due to its location to the Old Town scene. If we wanted froyo after our dinner, we could just go here. I love their seasonal flavors and their toppings.

I recently went here with my friends for a late night dinner on a Saturday night. I like the ambiance of the place. There was a live band and they were all right, but I found them to be a bit loud and made it difficult to talk to the people at the same table. The drinks here were really awesome. I really enjoyed the clown punch. The dirty school girl was also really good. The wait staff was really attentive and would check up on us every so often that we rarely found ourselves without want, but not so attentive that we found ourselves annoyed. The food was all right. I ordered the fish and chips here. And it was just all right in my opinion. I prefer a thinner filet of fish so I get the crispness rather than the softness when getting into the meat of the filet. The real highlight, for me, was the dessert. They have an awesome apple monkey bread that is made to order and served with vanilla ice cream. Now I'm not one to like to eat fruit, especially apple, in my desserts, but this was just so good. I'll go back again just to top off dinner with the monkey bread :)

Love the vibe of this place. It's fun and chill and can have a good crowd. Didn't get to try too much of the food, but what I did try, the mac and cheese, was really yummy and the wine selection wasn't bad and the fact that they had happy hour certainly doesn't hurt either. My friend had a table for his birthday and it was really great and the staff was super. And the music was pretty good and there was a place to actually dance if you wanted to. It's a place worth going to when you're looking for dinner and drinks or an alternative to the usual dance clubs in Old Town.

It use to be Dirty Pretty and I'm so glad they left and are now the awesome Roxy Lounge! Love this place! Love when they have bands! Love the vibe and the different music that's there. The area seems bigger now that they've opened up the area. They have a great open area for a dance floor and things seem more accessible. The prices are about on par with the rest of Old Town. This place will be a place I come back to :)

I saw their ads on like CL and had to see this place. I wanted to see if this too place was too good to be true and see if they weren't selling hot items lol. This place has super awesome deals here.  This place is behind the main buildings from the main street. It's best to turn on College and get to the store from there. Anyways, upon entering this place, I thought I was in the stock room or something with all the TVs and blu ray players around, but that's how the floor is. I went here specifically looking to a blu ray player with a built in wi-fi and found one - for like $39!! They have other name brands like panasonic, sony and all those for a bit more but not too much. If I had more money to spend, I'd probably would have walked out with a TV lol.  I know now that I need to shop here for my movie theater room stuff. And I don't need to wait for Black Friday for deals.

Place wasn't bad. It's okay. I've been a few times and wasn't too thrilled with the service. The drinks weren't anything special, it's just like any other bar. Based on the times I've been, the place looks packed and super fun, but I think it's just because their patio is in the front and that's where the smokers are. I dig the music, not really the people and I love my bars and clubs and Old Town but if I want a good bar with good service and people, I'd probably go next door to DJs or Giligan's or the Old Town Tavern or to the Rusty Spur and that list could go on.

I moved and needed a place to replace my go-to coffee place cause I like a good place for coffee if I have the time to enjoy, sit, and write. Found this place and I really like this place. The coffee is yummy and I like the vibe of the place. Didn't try the yumminess yet though.

I love donuts! With that said, I love Bosa donuts! The place isn't anything special but their donuts are are! I love that there is a good variety of donuts. I love french crullers and this place does my donut right! Another one I like, which is boring, but a good way to judge, is the sugar glazed donut. It's another favorite and can't go wrong. This donut, along with the other ones, are ones you can't go wrong with from Bosa. Aside from having awesome donuts, they're awesomely cheap! I can get a dozen donut holes for super cheap!

I went last night, Saturday, and I have to say it was a pretty good place. I was in the mood to dance and this fulfilled that wish. There was no cover and the drinks were reasonably priced. At first glance at the bar, it seems difficult to get to, but the further you get away from the entrance, which is close to the bar, the easier it is to get to.   The dance floor was awesome for the lights as was the DJ. While the DJ spun, there were videos projected on the wall. And as mentioned, for a place named Disco, it doesn't play disco, which would lead me to assume they named the place Disco short for discotheque. The dance floor was surrounded with booths and behind some of the booths had the usual stripper poles which the girls love to dance on.   There was still the stuff mountain lion overlooking the dance floor, which I did love lol. There were lots of different spaces in the club  to smoke, socialize and sit, which is quite rare; seating is usually scarce in my experience.   The only thing I found unenjoyable about the place was the lack of air getting to the dance floor. The fans or air vents were only located in certain places and didn't circulate well.

I have to say, when I first went here, I was not a big fan of this place. I thought it was all right. I didn't care for the crowd; it was super uber douche baggy. The music wasn't enough to make up for the crowd, but the drinks were. I did like a bartender, since he seemed to be one of the few that knew how to make a proper drink and the one to introduce me to to a pineapple mind eraser, which I have found to be a Scottsdale drink. I ordered a mind eraser when I was in Vegas, and was sorely disappointed; it was horrible and not at all the yumminess I had in Old Town, but that's another review.    Well since that first time, I was hesitant to go back there, but I was dragged back there on another night and was surprised. Yes, the crowd was still filled with the typical douche baggery and the Scottsdale Barbies, but found it to be a hell of a lot better than my first time. I love that it's a change from the usual places that play crappy music and it lets people get their dance on. The drinks are still yummy and strong. And it's now one of my go-to spots when I'm in the mood to dance. It's even better on Thursdays.

The food was all right, nothing too outstanding about it and nothing too bad about it. The service was all right. I find that the price was a bit much. I can understand paying extra if they were including their hot pot in the price, but they don't; they charge extra.

I have to say, I was a bit bummed that the last night we were in Vegas, we were not going to a club. But lo and behold, we practically ended up at one. Bond has a nightclub-esque feel to it. The music was awesome, the go-go dancers in their lil boxes were cute and had a cute theme going on. And being a girl, there were places to wander and sit since it's in the casino. The LED lights behind the bar were an eyeful, in a good and bad way lol. There was a wide array of people hanging out there, drinking, dancing and having an awesome time. And must say, their drinks were on point. They were surprisingly moderately priced and yummy. Their signature Cosmo was an orgasmic mouthful of a drink.  Love this place! This is now going to be a go-to spot for me :)

If I were writing this review on food alone, I'd give the place like 4 stars. They have really good food. They have this awesome pork belly biscuit app that is yummy. Good grilled cheese sandwich with some bacon and arugula that makes it a bit different from the usual. They have a good sangria that's like juice. I was looking forward to trying out different stuff when I went again, but I ran into the same problem, but magnified that I ran into last time I went, and that was poor service.   I and a group of my friends went back, wanting them to experience the food as well. And we went on a Friday night around 9:30 and, as expected, it was busy. Now, the last time I went, it was another Friday night around 8 and their place was slow, like the only tables in were ours, a table of 6 on a high top, and a few other patrons at the bar. Service was slow then too. I chalked it up to the fact that our server was pulling double duty and playing bartender.   But tonight was different. It was busy. It was like 15-20 minutes before happy hour, the band was going and the place was packed, like the usual restaurants in the area on a Friday night. And tonight, we were seated fairly quickly. Well, more like we were escorted to our table and then stood around, waiting for it to be bussed, but we were fine with that. We were able to sit down and peruse the menu. We were trying to make up our mind, when the person we thought was the server came over. It turned out that the guy wasn't our server, just a guy dropping off the silverware and plates. He apologized and corrected us in our error and assured us that our server would come by shortly.   Well that didn't happen. People came by, and they kept on going by. At one time, one my friends attempted to call the restaurant in order to get someone to get to the table, but no one answered. Maybe the band was too loud or maybe they just don't answer their phones. It was then, that was had a glimmer of hope - a server heading in our direction. And what did this server do? Keep on passing us by. Well, needless to say, that was the end of that visit. We had had enough. We don't think we're gonna be back, at least not for a long while.

So this place use to be awesome. Well at least I remember it being awesome. I remember the pizza was better and I remember the Greek fries were hella awesome. It's not so awesome anymore. I had the fries recently and they kind sucked, I was super disappointed. It was too cheesy, the dressing that it comes with didn't have the flavor it had. The fries left me feeling wanting. And to think, I used a cheat day on those fries makes me feel worse lol.

I like this place. It's close to campus for a good price and good portion sizes. I like their yummy Chicken Tikka Masala! They give you a good portion sizes. The other dishes were pretty good, samosas were ok, their curry is tasty and the food isn't that spicy. Super love their tikka masala fries. Yeah, I said tikka masala fries!   They're currently undergoing renovations to make the place a bit bigger and it's needed since it can get busy and full.

This is a good place for a night out and great for a girls' night out. I like it way better than when the space was the Crown Room. They remodeled a bit, changing the decor and the layout. It's has good music, great drinks and has the same crowd that would be going to Smashboxx. I say that because we saw a lot of the same people there we saw at Smashboxx. Haven't had any of their specialty cocktails. I wasn't even aware of them when I went. It was a bit loud and more a club than a lounge in my opinion. I'll have to make it a point to get one next time. The staff was awesome and the service was really good. I suggest this place every time I go out now with the friends.

I love the 99 Cent store. Not only is it super cheap but they have a good selection of things and fresh produce! This place is a broke college kid's haven; it has like 5 packs of ramen for 99 cents and energy drinks, and water. It's always a stop when I have to do some shopping. Oh, tip for getting yummy produce before it's all out - go at opening when they're stocking their produce section. I get a lot of salad ingredients and a lot of my fruit from here.

This place recently opened in January, I believe it was. It's where Huahachinango use to be. I live nearby and got a flyer promoting their restaurant and decided to try it out today. I went with a friend of mine for lunch and the place was empty. Now I'm chalking that up to the fact that we went for a late lunch; it was around 1 or so.   I had a carne asada plate. The carne asade come on top of a macaroni salad and fries. The meat itself is topped with mustard, onions and a meat sauce, which I opted to have on the side. I'm glad I did, as I found the sauce a bit bland. I wanted a kick or something, but I didn't get it without adding any of their toppings or anything. The macaroni salad was all right. Rather than using an elbow pasta, they used conchiglie and the mayo wasn't that sweet mayo I abhor. The fries weren't bad either. They weren't the usual shoestring cut and they weren't overly salty or oily. The carne asada itself was all right. It got a little too salty for me at one point. It was moist enough without the sauce. I was expecting more since the pictures on the wall make it seem like they'd have more to their dishes. My friend had a devil blanco plate and had the grilled chicken. It came with the same thing mine came with. She unfortunately got everything on it and it kinda dampened the enjoyment of the dish. I'm willing to give this place another try to see if something else there will be better.   A bit about the place: it says on the window that they're open on Friday and Saturday till 3am, but I'm not sure about that since as I've said, I live nearby and I haven't noticed them open. They're having a special, or at least did today when I went in - the plates were like 5.95 and it came with a drink. And according to the flyer we get, they're offering a two for one thing - buy a plate and you get one free. I don't know if that's still going on, but that's what the flyer we got said.  ***Edit to add a tip: add hot sauce to the food cause it makes the difference. A huge difference. It doesn't really change my rating, except to maybe a 2 1/2 stars. Still gonna try something else, so till then the rating is staying.

I really appreciate that there's a Sauce at the airport. It's a better alternative to the other pizza places that are a bit blah. It's a good place to have lunch. Food is always yummy and comes out in a timely manner, which is always appreciated since I have a limited lunch break. I've eaten my way through most of the menu, but haven't gotten around to the breakfast just yet. I did see that they have a breakfast pizza which piques my interest so I'll have to give that a try sometime.

I recently checked out this place after a friend had a craving for a hot dog/brat. I was curious to see how this place was, now that it was taking over the space that was previously Oregano's. The area that was once parking is now an awesome wide open patio area. And the fans going in the patio area made it bearable to be out there.   I wanted to guest chef sausage, but sadly, they were out, so I ended up going with the beer brat with relish. It was yummy. There was bit of heat to it, but not too much, just enough to keep it from needing any condiments to help in the taste department. They offered not only the usual, but they had a section for gourmet and exotic meats. Also got a side of fries with their hush hush sauce and their chipotle aioli. Their hush hush is reminiscent of In N Out's sauce which was yummy as was their chipotle sauce. They did offer ketchup and curry ketchup, but I didn't really indulge in that, but the curry ketchup was good with a fry or two. I did appreciate their beer selection. I tried their Lindemans framboise and their one that was apple. I think next time some of the other beers need to be tried but in the boot :P

Well I finally tried this place with a friend of mine. I was kinda interested to see how this would go since I saw that it had opened. They let you choose your own soup base, the type of noodle and the "toppings" you want. Well I didn't really know what to pick. I didn't any explanations as to what kind the soup bases were; I had to google them on my phone. And for me, the soup base is the most important part so I know what sort of toppings I wanted. So, I sort of just winged it. While my friend went with one of their soups from the menu.  Well, his soup was served first and upon looking at it, it looked like it was lacking, just things in general and was getting worried about mine, which came out a few moments afterwards. Looking at mine and looking at his, I found mine to be very full - full of noodles, veggies and toppings while his, well as stated, was lacking. Well, I can't say I loved my soup. I found it missing something, maybe if I knew more about their soups bases, I might have been better equipped to make choices. The soup didn't suck, but it wasn't as awesome as I wanted it to be.   I don't know if I'll be back anytime soon, but I'd probably try it again to see if it gets better.

This is one place I keep going to on my break while at the airport. I love the fries! I don't know if it's cause every time I go on break I'm super hungry or if they're that good, but i'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they're super awesome cause they still manage to taste fantastic even when I'm not having a craving for fries. The burger isn't too big, but it's yummy. I didn't find it soggy or whatnot, even after I had to walk a ways away to eat. Really love their shake of the month, which for me was a Kit Kat one. It hit that chocolate craving I had. I did find the shake a bit more liquid-y rather than thick so fair warning to you on that. I'll probably hit up this place again. As I said, I love their fries :P

So since I started working morning and being around breakfast food, I get a craving for fried eggs and bacon on my burger and thank goodness for Modern Burger and their breakfast burger. I get the yummy cheeseburger with my breakfast accoutrements lol. And to top it off, I still get their awesome fries. And when I want to splurge, I get another shake of the month, which so far hasn't disappointed me yet.

I love doing my veggie and fruit shopping here! They have a great variety and it all looks so yummy and tempting when I go. I like that they have seeds and grains so I can add some to my salads or make yummy cookies. Their deli section isn't bad, I wish there was a bit more in terms of meats and cheese to get sliced to order although they have plenty in their display coolers.

Came here expecting the worse just based on the average reviews for this place on yelp. And I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were super helpful in recommending alternate beers and they even give you samples to make sure you'll like something. Even on a busy night, the staff still made it to our table and had time to talk and recommend beers and even do samples :) And for the friends at our table that didn't want to wait, which wasn't too long, just went to the bar and got service there fine.  Some nights are louder than others, depending on the amount of people and if there's a band, but every time I go back, the level of service hasn't changed and I always find more and more yummy beers. And I have to say, that some of the beers they offer here just don't taste the same at other places where they offer the same beer. I really like this place. And it's becoming one of the places that I like to go on a regular. I so need to go back and get like a service industry card!

I super love that they have Spam and can add it to things! Love the different types of beer. I had #3, a raspberry wheat by grand canyon brewing; smell of raspberry and initial taste is the fruit with the after taste being kinda creamsicle-y. They also have draft wines.  So, to start off, we had the Mess, which was a mess, but a hot delicious one! The gravy that comes atop the fries was delish. The fries weren't too skinny and didn't get too soggy from the gravy but then again, I don't we let it sit long enough to get soggy. And the cheese curds made for a nice crunch with it. After eating it, I really wanted to add Spam and get a side of gravy lol. Maybe next time.  After the mess, it was now onto the pizza - the meaty treat. It certainly was a meaty treat for your mouth. It had all sorts of meat but with the added Spam, what can I say but 'heaven' (I'm Asian and I love my Spam). Next time, and there will be a next time, there should be a flight involved and another pizza with more Spam lol.

So since that first burrito, I have been back a few times to try something new each time. And I have to say that the burritos haven't changed in taste or size lol. It's still yummy and still hefty enough to be shared. There was still a weird after taste but I found that it grew on me. The chicken burrito was yummy but I think I like the machaca burrito the best. Get a burrito with some salsa and some guac and I'm a happy girl.

I love that LGO is in the airport!!! It's a great place to go for a break cause I can only take so much Modern Burger lol. LGO has a good variety of food and for a good price! It's as yummy as the street-side LGO in my opinion. I just wish they would make more had more of their salted chocolate chip cookies or at least have more in stock if they don't make them in house at the airport cause Chelsea's Kitchen pre-security doesn't have them for sale or in the size that LGO has. I also prefer their pizzas to Sauce's in the airport. They also have gelato, which is yummy. I have to say that LGO is totally worth getting past security early and walking to the D gates, even if your flight is in B or C lol.

Well I just keep loving LGO! I blame the baked goods that always seem to entice me when I go. Just when I think I'm done placing an order, I look over in the display at the pastries that seem to call out to me and say "Dani, look at me! Eat me! I'm yummy!" I'm making my way through their menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Well I'm not counting the time where I found that they stopped serving chilaquiles, I'm meaning taste wise.

I've been here once and thought it was alright. I only had the pizza and thought it was delicious - it was the crust that made it super yummy as well as their wine coolers, but there was nothing fabulous that would have me coming back all the time. So when I went again, I knew I was in store for yummy pizza but not sure what else.   I, and a friend, went back on a busy night. There were people waiting, even outside on a cold rainy night. While we waited, we managed to find a place at the bar and grabbed a beer. The wait didn't seem long and we were seated at a booth. The service was awesome, which was expected since last time was awesome, regardless of knowing one of the bartenders who took care of my friend and I.   Anyways, we started off our meal with their BOH soup. From my experience, in general, BOH soup is always yummy and worth trying! And their soup was worth trying, although I wish their soup of the night had been a bit spicier, it was good. My friend also had moved on from the beer to the hibiscus wine cooler and it was super yummy. I do need to order that next time.   After the soup, we were going to get two pizzas but decided to try an app and a pizza. Experience from last time told me that two pizzas would not be even close to being finished. The app we went for was the Meatball Trio. I wanted to try it for the polenta, the meatballs we're just bonus. I really liked it! The crunch from the polenta with soft yummy meatballs and their marinara sauce was awesome. And the pizza we had - the Manifesto - was just as awesome! I'm not normally a fan of goat cheese or fennel, but on the pizza, it was delish.   And when we thought we had had enough, we decided on dessert. We got a cobbler. Now I'm not a fan of cobblers or fruit pies, but their cobbler was something I ate up. The crust and fruit filling was awesome and was served hot so eating it with ice cream was a must. I just wish there was another scoop of ice cream since the one scoop melted into the dessert lol.   I will make sure to keep coming back and easy my way through their menu :p

Super super super psyched that Cartel is at the airport. I finally get away from Starbucks! Not that I don't love Starbucks, but sometimes - well, most of the time - I just want a coffee that's free of all the frills and shtuff that Starbucks has. They always know how to make my chai just right! The people are super friendly and know their coffee! They make the walk through security worth it!

I love this alternative to ice cream and froyo. I love the taro and condensed milk glaze. The topping can be interchangeable. So far I really love it with almonds cause I love the crunch. The shaved ice is great cause it isn't too heavy and it's just sweet enough. This place is definitely a place to try!

Whatever you do, don't start a tab here or use card!!! And if you do use a card, pay at the bar, per round!!!! Some friends and I went on Saturday for some day life fun. We got there early enough to get some beds by the pool under an umbrella. We decided on mimosas for drinks so we just went to the bar for a bottle and got some OJ. And that was great, we had no trouble. It was all fine and good. But as the day progressed, we got more champagne and was transferred to a server. She was all right. The place started to get packed and the usual douche baggery came out, which was expected. And it was an okay experience.   The bad part came when it came to getting the check and after. Since we got a daybed, they automatically charged some gratuity. Okay, well fine. That was all fine and good. What wasn't fine and good were the extra charges that came on the card the day after. I tried to call them a few times, but all I got was voice mail. I just left messages. And while the charges did go away after a while, the unnecessary hassle of extra charges on my card seriously detracted from the place.
