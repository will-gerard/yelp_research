Came here on a recommendation from my Mom's coworker. I made a reservation for two pedicures at 2:30 on a Friday. My Mom waited a half hour before anyone came over to start her pedicure. As for myself, it is almost 3:40 and I still have not had anyone start my pedicure. Oh wait someone did remove my old polish and then she walked away. So I am still sitting here. Oh did I mention two women came in after me and are almost done with their pedicures. Yes they came in well after I was here and are almost done. Hmm that doesn't seem right. I am almost inclined to get up and walk away. Then the owner came over to finish my pedicure. Ugh. This is the worst customer service I have experienced at a nail salon. Not only that but the worst pedicure experience. I left with not even having my feet massaged. My suggestion, don't come here ever. Worst experience ever.

I was first introduced to Gab's by my Mom.  She had been coming here for various auto repairs and oil changes.  Thank goodness for her recommendation.  I live in the West Valley and am more than willing to make the drive to Gab's so I can have my car fixed by Gab.  Everyone at Gab's Auto Repair is friendly, trustworthy and professional.  Karen and Gab are two of the nicest people. I never feel like they are trying to sell me anything my car does not need. I like their honesty and integrity.  I would recommend to anyone to bring your car here. And it doesn't hurt that Gab reminds me of my step Father-in-law.  :)

I was recommended to them by a friend who takes her dogs here for grooming. Unfortunately, I will not be taking my dogs here..EVER.  Although, I am happy my friend has never had a problem with this place, it took one phone call for me to decide to NEVER bring my dogs here. Customer service and friendliness was not a priority for the person who answered the phone. I called to schedule an appointment for my dog and was met with a condescending and demeaning attitude.  All because of shots my dog does not have but SHOULD have according to the woman who took down my information.   Dogs are required to have their rabies shots, which my dog has, thank you very much. But do not berate me about my dog not having her two other shots- Parvo and Bordetella. Especially after stating that my circumstances do not allow me to afford other shots not required by law.  I can understand if I regularly board my dogs, but I do not.  So how dare you speak to me like that and tell me that I need to get her other shots. I immediately cancelled my appointment and schedule with another groomer.  And when calling to complain to the grooming manager, I was met with the same attitude. Therefore, you will NEVER have my business.

Where do I begin?  A local area pawn shop recommended Radiant Jewelers to me because I was in need of getting my engagement ring rhodium plated; meaning I needed it dipped because the white gold was rubbing off. And I needed it to be all white gold again. They charged me $20!  So then I had my wedding band which was two toned, and I wanted that rhodium plated to match my engagement ring. I also needed a bracket replaced on the band. So I asked a jewelry store inside Arrowhead Mall; to do the rhodium plating and fix the bracket would have been $55 and up! Heck no! So I took the band into Radiant Jewelers.. it was less than $50.  Fast forward to today when I wanted a diamond from a ring set into my engagement ring, took it into them and it is less than $100. All I have to say is, I love their reasonable prices and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  They don't treat their customers like dollar signs. Plus they have fast repairs and excellent quality in their work.  They are now my jewelry store for all my engagement and wedding rings needs.

Thanks to another local coffee shop being closed, my friend and I were able to try this place. It was great!! The ambience was awesome, the coffee delicious and the staff friendly. We happened to stumble upon open mic night which are held on Tuesday evenings. So glad we did. Nothing beats enjoying some coffee while catching some live tunes.  Plus it's housed in a historic house which adds awesome character to it. This place is a true gem.  Starbucks eat your heart out!

Was disappointed to find this place closed. I wanted and was looking forward to trying this place on a Tuesday evening. I saw on Yelp and their website that it was open until 8:00 pm Tuesdays. However, such was not the case. My friend and I came to find posted on their door that they were closed at 3pm. That's funny because the website listed something different. Here is a link: http://www.shotofjava.com. So with this being said, I would have loved to try this place because they are locally owned and I'm all about giving these places my business but it doesn't help when I'm given the wrong information. Perhaps they should update their website to reflect their real hours. They look like a great place and I'm hoping to be able to try the place on a weekday evening.

I found this place on Yelp as I was looking for a restaurant in the Valley the served po boys and friend green tomatoes.  I was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious, the staff was professional and friendly, and the ambiance took me back to Louisiana.  I plan on coming back to get my po boy fix and would recommend this place to anyone craving gumbo, fried green tomatoes and po boys.

Never again will I go here to try to sell my clothes.  This place is full of themselves and their buying policies are ridiculous.  First of all, I am a thirty something year old whose clothing style is pretty much up to the fashion standards of today. Secondly, my clothes, purses and shoes are very well taken care.  However, such was not the case when I recently tried selling some clothes, shoes and purses here.  How exactly is a denim skirt from the Gap out of style?! Or how is a Coach purse not good enough?! Evidently my never before worn, still have the tag on them sandals from Payless had wear and tear. Are you kidding me?!? And a cute yellow coat from Nordstrom's, which I have seen similar styles of coats being sold in stores recently, is evidently not  cool enough!? Because apparently they won't take anything more than a  year old. Did I mention I saw a pair of beige wedges from Payless of which I have the exact same pair of but in black that I bought two years ago. So much for their policy! Seriously though, do NOT bother trying to sell your things here because you are better off  donating your things or going somewhere that does not have an identity crisis (me thinks they think they are some hip clothing store that you find at the mall with brand new name brand things.) They only bought two of my things, a pair of Bongo jeans and Mossimo cowboy boots (gee thanks) and all for seven dollas  make ya holla. Overall, I wish I had never gone here and will not be going back.

Jonathan is professional and courteous. He is incredibly knowledgable and trustworthy. I would not think of going to anyone else to help me with my taxes. I recommend him implicitly.
