I will drive the extra distance to go to chik fil a now. This location has THE most rude employees i have ever come in contact with. The fries tasted like they were from yesterday. When we asked for more sauce he handed it to us and slammed the window. I will never go there again.

So irritated with this company!!!  We got our windshield replaced almost 2 months ago and have yet to see this $80 gift card that was promised to us. When we called last week the guy said they sent it over a month ago. He said someone would be checking on it and would call us back. Still no call. Please dont offer things if you don't plan on following through!!!

I pass by 5 dd on my way to work. I cannot stand this location. They are beyond rude. I pull up to the window  and she doesnt say a word. I hand her my card, she swipes it and gives it back. Still no words uttered. She hands me my hot latte, with no sleeve, i say "thank you" she looks back at me and walks away. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? worst customer service!!

This place was delicious!!! The food is super fresh and the staff is so friendly! The food came out quicker than McDonald's and it's way healthier!!! We will be back at least once a week!!
