I tried to call and get information, regarding a movie spoke to a gentleman named Brock. Very rude and disrespectful, was unhelpful... in fact he hung up on me. I'll never return to this theater again save your money and time! Go to  Harkins or ipic! The food and customer service is Way better not to mention the last time I went to this amc theater there was dirty utensils in my chair!!!

I highly recommend Dr. Troy! As a Nurse I'm always on my feet, my back and neck take a toll. for the past week I've been stuck in bed with low back pain and intermittent migraines. After one session with Dr. Troy I feel better already! I have seen previous chiropractors before and none of them compare to his work!
