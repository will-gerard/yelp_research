"Eat when you're hungry and eat 'til you're happy"...one of the rules I live by:)  One of the simpler rules, really...so much less difficult to deal with than other rules:  * "Neither a borrower, nor a lender be" - sure, great advice when the economy is in the crapper, but you might want to think about levering up in boom times:)  * "Do not covet thy neighbor's wife" - Hey, if I hadn't done a little coveting, the Beautiful Carin would not be my blushing bride today:)  * 9.80665 m/s2 = 1G - It's not just a good idea, it's the law (probably...in this universe:)  And so it came to pass that I was, in fact, hungry after my run and before I hit the driving range yesterday...one of my buddies called and suggested La Tolteca.  I said "Who?"...The Toltec?  But Wes seems to know his Mexican food and I seem to enjoy decent Mexican food, so off I went...to a really interesting part of town:)  I guess I don't get out much...hookers ambling up and down the street at 11:30 am?...People urinating behind dumpsters in the parking lot?...The unmistakable (and appetite enhancing) aroma of ganga being smoked nearby?  I don't see much of that from my deck in Old Town:)  I also don't get tamales that are this good in Old Town, either...m'mmm, m'mmm good...with a great big side of atmosphere:)  I chose wisely and thoroughly enjoyed my number 3...two plump, succulent and spicy beef tamales, covered with red sauce...I added a couple of little plastic cups of habanero salsa to my Styrofoam plate and headed for a table in the well muraled dining area (the murals really are nice...an artistic depiction of life on Van Buren, near La Tolteca...bright and colorful:)  BTW, La Tolteca is a market and bakery, too!  If you happened to want...oh, say a beer or 4 at lunch, you can swing through the market and pick up a six pack of Bud for about what you'd pay for one beer at Loco Patron...and after lunch, you can grab a cupcake on your way out for about 95 cents (about 3% of what you'd pay for a crapcake at Sprinkles:)  Wes and I chatted and ate...the tamales were excellent...the company was excellent...I was charmed, by both La Tolteca itself (a sweet little outpost) and by the grittiness of this stretch of Van Buren (a street that gives us all a glimpse of how a post apocalyptic world might look).  It was worth the trip, for the food, for the look into another world and for a chance to catch up with my pal:)  Go during daylight hours...park in the very safe "hooker patrolled" parking lot...avert your eyes from the public urination ("ma'am...that's really not appropriate":) and have a super burrito or a couple of tamales at La Tolteca...eat 'til you're happy:)

I really like this place...a lot! I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur of mexican food (I like a lot of the places here in Phoenix and Scottsdale...a by-product of being raised where everybody thinks Taco Bell and Taco Time are "mexican food"), but I know what I like and Ranch Market's cafe is terrific!! I met a couple of friends here for lunch today, and was, as always, happy and full when I left. I had tameles today (my touchstone for the best in mexican food)...they were great...hot, soft, perfectly spicy, with the sauce ( I do believe I am getting aroused!  OK back to business. I have had burritos, various tacos, the hot dogs (nogales style), the sopa's and you know what? They are all really tasty and the people at Ranch Market are really nice. The prices are cheap (esp. when you compare the prices to some of the pricier mexican restaurants that, frankly, don't measure up, taste-wise and quality-wise to this cafe). Lastly, I could make a meal of their chips and salsa, fresh made, warm, spicy...I'm getting hot again. Go to Ranch Market, enjoy that cafe, you'll be glad you did!

Power yoga class today.  What great way to detox your body and find all the muscles and balance points you rarely use (you'll find them the hard way, BTW, but that's another story). As I was lying on the mat at the end of the class, listening to Max (our instructor/Chief Yogi), telling us to just be and to try to not think...try not to eat or drink for an hour after the session and just let our bodies detox, all I could think of was "what can I eat to retox as quickly as possible, that won't kill me where I stand?" Not an easy question to ponder, even with the existential power of yoga still pulsating through every fiber of my being...a chili dog from Ted's or Long Wong's?; an Italian Beef  from Luke's; Chicken and waffles from Lolo's? And then it hit me, almost causing me to stir from my yoga induced coma, Taco's de Juarez!!!!! As anyone who has read even one of my reviews will tell you, I am a "Trendinista" of the first order.  I follow the herd, make no mistake about it!  Why? Because, occasionally, the herd knows where it's going...and this is one of those very special occasions! I had spotted this place before...on my way by at high speed, to get to Welcome Diner for a burger. But since I wasn't packing, I never, ever stopped rolling, let alone got out of my car here.  Yelp changed all that. This place has some terrific reviews, in spite of the fact that there isn't a Betos or Bertos in sight.  Worth a try, right? Taco's of Juarez is a delightfully dirty little gem...the proverbial diamond in a goat's ass.  I sat down and the sweet little non-english speaking waitress brought chips and salsa...The Two Grinders (Los Dos Molino's) need to take salsa lessons from these folks...some of the best salsa I have had (the salsa verde is definitely the best I've had in the US...makes me long for couple of places along the beach in Bahia de Navidad). In an effort to retox as quickly as possible, I ordered the number 16 lunch especial...a shredded beef gordita ("gordita" means "meat wrapped in lard, then deep-fried" in Spanish) and a cerveza (ice, ice cold BTW). Freakishly good...I know, it was almost pure lard that had been heated to point where it lost its molecular cohesion and liquefied...but it was damn tasty lard. I forked a little salsa chile and salsa verde onto the gordita (accompanied by refritos and rico) and dug in. I awoke to shouts of "clear" as the feverish paramedics worked to restart my heart...just kidding!  I am fine:) !! So, go to the pawn shop and find yourself a nice little Sig Sauer 9mm pistol and holster, turn on the car alarm and go try Taco's of Juarez. Possibly the best Mexican food in town! And now, another one on my list of favorite places to retox after I've detoxed!

las noches de las luminarias may be one of the most perfect ways to spend an evening during the holiday season:)  It's been a while since I could say I was "enchanted" by anything...I was enchanted by las noches de las luminarias at Desert Botanical Garden:-)  The Beautiful Carin and I had not been to las noches de las luminarias ("lndll":) before...in fact, when she told me we were going, I think I said something to the effect "it's just another way to separate us from our money at Christmas time...Bah...Humbug!!!" :-)  Carin said something like "lighten up Ebenezer", and off we went:)  Well, lndll does separate you from a little cash to get in and a little more to have a toddy or three by the fire...but it's money well spent...maybe even money well invested:)  We got into the garden shortly after sunset and I have to say, I was awed from start to finish!  As we walked in, we were greeted with spectacularly lit Chihuly Glass cacti, along with hundreds of luminarias lighting our path...the soft sounds of a mariachi band playing just inside the entrance, adding a distinct Sonoran feel to the experience:)  Once inside we wandered around and just simply enjoyed all that was happening and all that we were seeing...around one corner, the path led through a small stand of dimly lit Pipe Organ Cacti...around another bend, a bluegrass band playing from a perch nestled between giant boulders...over there, a children's handbell choir playing holiday favorites...always with the silhouette of Papago in the background and luminarias and well placed decorative holiday lighting in the plants to guide us:)  No one seemed to be in a hurry...no one pushed or raced along the paths...everyone smiled and chatted with each other...we had a number of brief, cheery conversations with people that we had never seen before and will never see again...we helped a couple of snowbirds that had a stuck wheelchair (I helped with a song in my heart and smile on my face..not like me at all...my heart must be growing 3 sizes! :-)...here, during lndll, it was just what you do!  As the evening grew a little late and some of the luminarias began to flicker and die, we found a spot next to the fire in the Berlin Agave Yucca Forest and had a couple of Steaming Hot Martini's (I have no idea what was in them, except liquor...but they were tasty and warming and they made us happy:)  We sat there for a while and talked as we watched the fire, the flickering luminarias and the dwindling crowds...and I came to the conclusion that this might have been one of the best Christmas investments ever.  I hope you'll go and invest in Desert Botanical Garden, lndll and yourself...it's more than worth the price of admission:)  Save me a spot by the fire and I might even buy you a Steaming Hot Martini :-)

I finally played Papago again (after the revamp) and I am impressed with the improvements. It was the best course in the City of Phoenix owned family, but with the new management and the revamp (old-vamp?) of the course...they apparently put the course back to being much closer to the way it was in the `60's...I found it to be a much better track. They removed a bunch of trees, which frankly make for much better sight lines from the tees and into the greens. Then trees that are left serve a purpose, and are attractive and in good health, as opposed to the trees and bushes that were essentially "debris" for the past few years. Also, the desert areas have been cleaned up and the course really looks nice! Finally, as with all City of Phoenix courses, it is really great to be able to walk a golf course, and play real golf, instead of the resort/cart golf that we have to play at most of the the resorts/clubs around here. I am looking forward to playing Papago again after they have the LPGA stop later this month.

As a pizza savant, I am severely limited by both nature and nurture:)  I have been to the pinnacle (Bianco's Pizzeria)...a couple of times, in fact...and found it unfulfilling:(  I have looked into the pizza abyss (Chuck E Cheese or Totino's Frozen...too close to call), and come away scarred but stronger.  I suppose some of it is nurture...the cattle ranch was a hard place to grow up and I did not eat pizza until I left home at 15 for college...Shakey's in Corvallis, OR:)  Losing my pizza virginity was a revelation and a delight:)...I was forever altered...forever better:)  And there is, no doubt, some nature involved...I can only think of 2 things that I can't eat and neither one involves pizza of any sort:)  And that brings me to today...I will at least try anybody's pizza pie:)  Some are better than others, but very few are truly bad:)  So when the Beautiful Carin and I wandered over to Oregano's the other night, it was with the anticipation of a pretty good pizza and a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy it in:)  We were not disappointed:)  The entirely reasonable 20 minute wait went by quickly with free pizza slices to nibble and frequent refills for our drinks, while we sat comfortably and listened to the music:)  When we got our table...outside, under the mist...our server was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable...but we already knew what we wanted:)  It's all pretty good at Oregano's:)  This time we had a deep dish pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and olive pie, along with a Mrs. Gibbilini's spinach salad...way too much for 2 people but the leftovers are great for lunches and dinner for 2 more days:)  We've had the thin crust, the Chicago style, sandwiches, and salad...even the wings, on occasion:)  The pies are well designed, well prepared, customizable and tasty!  The sauce isn't too sweet, the cheeses selected for the pies complement the sauce and the crusts are well made and have great "tooth"...the right mix of crunchy vs. chewy:)  I've seen the debates...oh yes, I read the reviews..."Chicago pies rock"..."New York is the only real pizza"...yada, yada, yada:)  Well, I am waiting for a pizza to rock my world the way that first slice of Shakey's pepperoni did, all those years ago...it may not ever happen...they say you never forget your first time:)  But Oregano's always serves up a good pie (regardless of whether I'm in the mood for Chicago, Thin crust, deep dish or whatever...along with all the accompaniments and alternatives I could ask for:)  Does Oregano's rock my world?...No, only the Beautiful Carin does that these days, but they do bake up a pretty decent pie:)

I went to lunch with some buddies today (another review to follow), and I was bemoaning the lack of decent place to get a Black & White cookie in Scottsdale/Phoenix. Problem solved!!! I had seen places noting that they used Karsh's bakery for their bread, but I didn't realize the bakery was for all kinds of things. We went in for a Black & White cookie (which was as good as anything I can get in New York...soft, moist, the icing was a little bit crunchy, not gooey...perfection for a Friday afternoon treat!), and came out with a marble rye, an olive loaf and 4 cupcakes (a bargain at $1.45 ea, and much better than Sprinkles...almost as good as Tammy Coe). What a great little bakery!! It's a bit of a drive, but not too far if i go after a workout at the Village. I think I have found my "go to" bakery!

It just seemed like the thing to do...I was good at lunch, after all:)  I was just going to go back to the office after my non-retox lunch, but I saw two accidents in quick succession, and then saw a blockage a few blocks ahead and decided to detour...BTW, is everybody driving drunk today? Are they all stupid? 128 years old?   One accident was a faux-hawk in a beater Chevy that just decided a lane change without looking was the right move...unfortunately, there was Ford PU already occupying that very space:(  The other accident was a near shoulder to shoulder U-Turn by Mel Brooks' 2,000 year old man...he was looking under his steering wheel when his Mercury was slowed in it's stately progress by the side of a Lexus SUV:(  I saw both "accidents" start and finish...luckily (and most importantly) none of the flying debris hit me:)  My detour took me close to Karsh's and I decided a stop was in order:)  Hadn't I been good at Lunch?...Yes!  Weren't my nerves jangled from witnessing all of this automotive mayhem?...Yes!  Did I really need any reason to swing by and pick up a Cinnamon Bobka, 6 eclairs and a Black & White Cookie for the weekend?...Not Really:)  Fresh and fully stocked Karsh's...they were busy, but smiling and friendly...all my baked goodies, out the door for $20:)  Everything is safely back home, now...out of the reach of all of these spatially "challenged", motorized go-tards:)  Well...all are safely home except the Black and White Cookie...he didn't even make it all the way to Scottsdale...but he went down happy:)

Christmas really isn't my holiday...it's more for the Beautiful Carin, and I try my very best to play along and do what I should to make the holiday "joyful"...not my strong suit:)  This Christmas is no different than 30 or 40 others that preceded it...it's the end of the year and that always bring its own peculiar brand of "troubles".  Today, I had to visit with one of my attorney's (I know, pathetic)...some trouble with some partners in a business relationship and I am trying to figure out what the best course of action is...this attorney is my Doberman...he will chase people to the bowels of hell and bring them back screaming to be returned to Satan's loving grasp...if the compensation is right:)  I don't Yelp him, because frankly, he scares me...a little bit:)  I was bemoaning the holiday season to him during our session today (believe it or not our "chit chat" is quite brief at $425 per hour), and his legal advice was that I "sack up" and get over it:)  To reinforce that, he took me to lunch (I must look like I'm going to be a gold mine to him!) at Scott's Generations:)  That did indeed put a smile on my face and prepared me adequately for my next meeting this afternoon.  I love deli...I get to NYC 2-3 times a year, and consequently I don't think very much of the deli's here in town...overpriced, under-sized...less than we should expect:(  Even Goldman's, who's been good for several years, has fallen sharply over the past year.  Scott's could change my perception of the deli landscape in PHX.  I had a hot corned beef on rye that was as tasty as anything I've found in Phoenix...and it was huge...a restricted flight softball of hot, moist corned beef, between two thick slices of rye (from Karshes, next door, with plenty of caraway seeds:)  Four salt brine pickle spears, and cole slaw, accompanied this behemoth:)  I couldn't leave well enough alone and ordered a side of crinkle cut fries to "make the season bright":)  $11.00 US money for the whole deal (no extra charge for "extra lean":)  Everything was well made, tasty and nicely presented by the sweet ladies that serve the all the customers...I mean 20-25% tip service by these sweethearts:)  I waddled out, with my mood adjusted back to "non-grinchy" (I'm sure this lunch will appear on the bill from my attorney, at some point...I just choose not to think about it right now:)  I didn't even have room for a Black and White cookie from Karshes, after lunch...that's packing in the corned beef!  While Scott's Generations is not, strictly (or even un-strictly) speaking "kosher", it is definitely in  the traditional "New York Style":)  No, I would not claim it's as good as anything in Manhattan...but I gotta tell you, it's as good as a lot of neighborhood deli's in Manhattan...and easily the best of breed for PHX.

Phoenix City Grill is an institution, and it should be.  My second dinner out, after I moved here with the Beautiful Carin, was at PCG (the first was at Tuchetti's, dear departed Tuchetti's...maybe not the best Italian food in town, but truly...was there ever a dish that could fill you up like their baked spaghetti with meat sauce?...it must have been 5 lb's. of food on the plate...my dear sweet lord). Anyway...I met a friend at PCG for lunch yesterday.  I didn't get to pick...I don't get to pick the restaurants for client and friend lunches for a while...not since the sad and regrettable Frank & Lupe's incident. But, I was glad for change of pace...out of Old Town and my rut of wanting to walk everywhere I go.  I fired up the Edsel and off I went to 16th and Bethany Home for a revisit of a Phoenix classic! PCG is PDG ("pretty damn good") food and attentive service. Mark had gotten there a little before me and gotten a table. The waitress was there as I was sitting down.  Interestingly, Mark had gotten a big ol' glass of red wine to start lunch...a delightful way of lunching for business people that has fallen into disrepute over the past decade or so. I followed suit. We must fight this non-drinking at lunch scourge by taking every opportunity to imbibe at lunch, and I, for one, will help lead the fight! The menu hasn't changed very much over the past few years, but really, why screw around with what is working...the place is always full, everybody seems to enjoy their meals, including me BTW:), and they just go on printing money, year after year! What's not to like about that formula? They had some nice specials (including a bunch of seafood specials), but frankly, I rarely eat seafood at non-seafood specialty restaurants in the middle of the desert. I opted for the Cuban Hamburger.  A novel preparation, one that was highlighted by some of the tastiest pickles I have ever had on a burger! I actually do taste the food as I hoover it down:) PCG is still doing great and doesn't need anything more from me than my credit card for payment when the check comes...keep up the good work!

I practice Polytheism...the belief in and worship of many gods.  I know, I know it's controversial...perhaps even pagan...but there it is.  I think all of our little silicon, electron driven overlords require much of us, and we ignore that call for service at our own peril.  While some of us fall down prostate and gesticulate in the direction of Redmond, Wa., twice a day, others make the annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Cupertino and pray for a new revelation from the almighty "Jobs".  Other's speak in strange tongues..."ubuntu", "fedora", "GNOME" , "APK/SDK" and much more.  I take no chances...I worship them all (which is pretty entertaining when you see me in Silicon Valley, trying to hide my flopping and pointing towards Redmond while chanting "Linux" over and over and over).  As an acolyte of these many religions , I build and present many offerings to these tiny silicon deities (known to the congregation as "apps") for these devices to digest and use in the furtherance of their unknowable agenda!  My latest offering to the gods was to purchase a couple of the precious amulets known as "iPad"!  These quartz and precious metal artifacts are the latest "dream catchers" to come flying out of the holy scepter of the great and powerful "Apple" and they are well worth your time and effort to get to know!  I assume that you are reading this on the "InterWebs" (unless you are like one of my older clients...not one of the brethren...he has his assistant "print"...on "paper" anything that she thinks might interest him...such a wonderful throw back to Jonathan Swift and his delightful flappers) and if you are, then these religious artifacts...these "iPad's", are where the world is going...at least right now.  So I made my offerings (thanks goodness they don't require a human sacrifice to get one of these things...although I do have a few candidates for such sacrifice if it ever becomes necessary) and became the possessor of a couple of these holy objects.  The Church of Apple at the Biltmore made this whole process very easy and I have to say that Judy, one of Apple's vestal virgins (OK, I have no way of knowing if she's a virgin... I just take it on faith) is one of the best of Apples priestesses...known as "geniuses"...she was friendly, capable and loving, in her way.  She sweetly and quickly initiated me into the ways of the iPad...no muss, and a minimum of fuss!  And while these aren't the first Apple icon's that I've possessed, they are the very best and most precious.  But as soon as mighty Google produces an artifact like "iPad", I know I will need to make similar offerings to the twin demi-gods known as "Larry" and "Sergei", in order that they may purchase divine fuel for the holy 767, the better to advance their cause of "indoctrinating" every attractive co-ed at Stanford (best pick-up line ever - "hey, wanna go for a ride in my jet")...truly, holy work!  BTW, the mighty Google frightens me the most of all the gods I worship...if they can't index your information, you just might cease to exist.  http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_ceo_suggests_you_change_your_name_to_escape.php

I was at the club the other morning, grooming myself after my workout (you know, much like lions and monkeys...picking off the tic's and lice, smoothing my fur using saliva, etc.:-) and I thought to myself, "I need a haircut:-)  BTW, if I can just digress for a moment...I see things at the club that no person should ever be subjected to...this particular morning was no different...an 85 year old, Grandpa Jones look alike, standing naked at one of the sinks, one leg up on the counter and shaving "himself" in places that I had trouble believing that anyone other him would care about...you just can't "un-see" that kind of thing:(  If that describes you...please, for the love of god...go into a shower stall or something...I was blinded from seeing this and I spent the next twenty minutes stumbling along, asking for someone to just put me out of my misery, before I managed to grope my way into a shower and boil myself:)  Anyway...I still needed a haircut...(or, I needed to reform my band from 1970...we played a very ragged version of "House of the Rising Sun"...and that's about all we played:)  These days, my choice for sartorial reconstruction is V's Barber Shop...I used to go to Great Clips, but V's  has won me back and won me back for good:)  This location is everything I want in a great barber shop...a manly experience that simply cannot be duplicated at a "salon":)  Nowhere near enough testosterone in any salon...even the unisex Super Clips and Great Cut's:)  That's not the case at V's...it's all testosterone, all the time:)  The barbers are all barbers...they may be stylists too, but first and foremost, they are barbers...they know how to cut hair for men and they know how to chat with guys like the great barbers I used to frequent in San Francisco and Portland.  Lots of sports to talk about (and flat panel TV's with ESPN on at every station), plenty of magazines to read while I'm waiting for my call to action (and not a Cosmo or Vogue in sight:) and tons of wood paneling and manly smells (I mean witch hazel, talcum powder, etc....not "pull my finger" manly smells:)  And, most importantly, they cut my hair correctly...all of the barbers and any of the barbers at V's do a good job...they cut my hair right...as right as my poor misshapen head will allow:)  That's important to me, because (as I might have mentioned before), I'm not a "classically handsome" man...I'm a little bit "quirky looking"...and a decent haircut helps:)  I'm pretty sure that a good haircut is the only thing that keeps the Beautiful Carin from second guessing herself and the (possibly drunken) decision making that led her to select me as her husband (no one ever believes that she proposed to me...I can't believe it myself...but that was a great haircut that I was sporting that day! :-)  So I'm back at V's and I'm happy to swing by and get my "ears lowered" (a colloquialism that I suppose is lost in the mists of time) and talk football and golf and chicks and other guy stuff with my buddies at V's:)  And if you need one, there are even post or pre-haircut cocktails available next door at the Arcadia Tavern...and believe me, sometimes quite a bit of alcohol is required to forget the horrors I've seen in the locker room at the Village:)  "Involuntary Shudder"...

I met a friend for here for cocktails a couple of weeks ago.  When I got home and answered the query "where did you go for drinks?", I was reminded by the Beautiful Carin just exactly how long it had been since we had been to T Cook's for dinner...apparently a very long time:(  Because, while I did remember having dinner there, I couldn't have told you the year or the time of year...luckily, I have the Beautiful Carin to remember these things for me:)  You know, I don't why we haven't made it back to T Cook's a little more often!  T Cook's is one of those rare places that can genuinely say "everything is good" when you ask for their recommendations:)  Maybe it's just me, but the atmosphere, ambiance, service and food combine in subtle (but effective) ways to create a meal experience that you really don't find very often...T Cook's is a jewel:)  I have heard that they went through a bit of rough patch, service and consistency-wise, but if our dinner last week is an indicator, they have solved any problems that they might have had:)  I was lucky enough to miss any rough spots...3 years between visits will do that for you:)  We had a 7:30 reservation, and by 7:38 we were drinking perfectly made, ice cold Ketel One martinis at the table, and enjoying our conversation (Carin is one of the most delightful conversationalists you could ever hope to meet...she still keeps me entertained and enchanted...we still have so much to talk about after all this time:)  Onion soup, Lobster Bisque and pate started our meal (and could have completed it...it was so good...fortunately, I'm a big eater:)  Carin had Poulet Rouge (Red Chicken? Seriously, the menu nomenclature people need to re-think that one...When I think of red chicken, I think of salmonella, but that's not what they mean:)   I know, I know... they mean the chicken is red with pecan wood smoke, and it is and it's a terrific dish, but still...the name:)  I had braised short ribs...perfectly done with a marvelous horseradish infused risotto cake:)...Inspired:)  They also have some very pleasant and tasty sides:)  We had brussel sprouts (that were nearly as good as the sprouts I make at home:)...and potato puree...and seared Foie Gras...decadent and wonderful:)  I tried to get Carin to have the foie gras with me, but we differ in our opinions about foie gras, and so, I had to take the bullet and eat it all myself:)...That should make my cardiologist buddies happy:)  Time really can stand still when you're having an evening like this...by the time we finished our shared Chocolate Napoleon and coffee, it was 10:30 and way past our bed time:)  But such a pleasant evening...never any rush from the servers, never a wait for the next course...everything perfectly timed, completely unobtrusive (no, our conversation was never interrupted to inquire "do you love everything?":)  It was worth staying up late for an evening as pleasant as this...and almost worth waiting three years for, too!  But we won't wait three more years to swing by T Cook's again...they are just too good and right in the hood:)

I've been a member of the Village since I moved to AZ in 2004 and I love 'em...all of 'em. But this is where I started and since the beautiful Carin and I moved back to Old Town Scottsdale a few months ago, we switched back to the Camelback location as our primary club (we have a membership that lets us use any of the clubs and we worked out mostly at DC Ranch and Gainey Ranch when we lived in north Scottsdale). The facilities are terrific and since they remodeled the Camelback location to bring it up to par with the others (and probably better than Gainey, although I do love the steam room at Gainey Village...sinks in the steam room, so that I can shave in the steam room...pretty sweet!). I am not a class taker. I have done the yoga classes a few times, but nothing other than that. The beautiful Carin is a class taker and loves the classes and the instructors. I am runner, cardiac and lifter kind of guy for the regular exercise and I play squash, all of the equipment is up to date and in good shape. The Village also does a great job on events for members. They just had a casino night that was really very fun, and included in the membership fees. They do all sorts of things like that from golf outings to ski trips to hikes in the Grand Canyon...a little something for everyone. Mostly, the people are why I give these clubs  (and esp. Camelback) 5 stars...we have met some of the nicest people at the club. Some of the guys that I play squash with have become family friends, as well as some of the people that work at each of the clubs. The Village has a great feel and is, for my money (and it is my money, haha), the best club in AZ.

DeeDee went in for her 100,000 mile checkup and shot's update today:)  She's 14  1/2 years old which (according to Dr. Bracken) equates to roughly 100 years old in human terms!  It's fairly rare for chowchows to live that long, although I have been extraordinarily fortunate to have both my chows live to a very ripe old age (Sam, my big chow made it to 16  1/2...I still miss him! :-)  I frankly credit most of that good fortune to Dr. Bracken and the wonderful people at Arcadia Animal Clinic...I have had many pets over the years and used many vet's in Portland and San Francisco...they were all good, all came highly recommended by trusted friends, co-workers and the like...but none of them measure up to Arcadia Animal Clinic!  We were looking for a vet after we had been in Arizona for few months and started asking around...more than  1/2 the people we asked mentioned Dr. Bracken as the best they'd met and highly recommended AAC...The beautiful Carin and I looked at each other and said "this can't be a coincidence...6 people that don't even know each other recommend this place...let's go see him!"   And we did:)  Chow's aren't noted for either their patience or their warm and inviting demeanor...they are a little bit aloof and intimidating...I like that in a dog...both Sam and Dee are coal black, and with their black fur, black tongues, black eyes and gleaming white teeth and fangs, when they smile at you, it can look a little sinister:-)  But they aren't...they are teddy bears and Dr. Bracken and the staff at AAC took the time to understand that (they approach each pet as an individual and get to really know that animal:)  That was apparent at the first meeting of my dogs and Dr. Bracken, when he got down on the floor with them and they talked and played and became great friends (my dogs always love going to AAC...they love Dr. Bracken:)  All that personal rapport with my pup's is and has been critical...not necessarily when they are just in for a checkup or a shots update...but when DeeDee tore her ACL trying to chase a bunny or when she had a minor stroke last year...or when Sammy was finally just too tired to go on and they helped him over with respect and dignity...sorry...I can't see though the tears right now...  AAC is the best veterinary clinic I've found and Dr. Bracken is the best vet I've ever met!

Do you like sliders? Yup, I do too! I admit it, as much as l enjoy fine dining, I really do have pedestrian tastes. You can only eat eat so much pate and stuffed breast of duck before you need something real. I know sliders are everywhere these days. I live near Stax and I like it fine.  I see sliders on the menu so many of the other places I go, but these...these are really sliders and they are really great and really just what god and nature intended when ground beef was created!  Small, delightful chunks of bovine goodness! Plus, Chicago Hamburger has some of the best chili fries around to go with the sliders, and that really makes the drive, and the poor parking at lunch and the difficulty finding a place to sit at lunch and all the rest (I actually feel like I'm in Chicago) worth the effort! The regular burgers and the hot dogs are pretty good , too (bright green relish and celery salt for the dogs, so good for them), but really...sliders are the reason to go to Chicago Hamburger.

I'm out of the closet!  Yay!  No more hiding who I really am!  I'm a proud member of the Rainbow Donuts coalition.  It's not a choice...not just a lifestyle selection (although the donut selection is, in fact, quite robust)...no, it's how I am constructed!  OK, actually I'm bi...I enjoy the occasional "breakfast burrito", but if I'm pressed to choose...I'll take the hole and the "Old Fashioned Glazed" that surrounds said hole.  That and a good cuppa.  And that's one of the things that separates Rainbow from the rest...the coffee...outstanding Italian roast, well made and very inexpensive...with enough refills to take a bath in.  And I would bathe in the coffee (and possibly the donut glaze) except for the inevitable "dust-up" that always occurs when I let my impulses run wild and free!  Don't get me wrong...the donuts are terrific and the nice young lady behind the counter was almost as sweet as the apple fritters.  I had a client meeting there this morning (I know, I spare no expense!), and my clients were just as charmed as I was with Rainbow...the great coffee, the terrific donuts and fritters and the pleasant service (not to mention free wi-fi for my meeting) all combine to make Rainbow Donuts a significant step above the rest.  Most of all, it's the place where I can feel free to be my real, authentic self...out, loud and proud!  And growing a little with each fritter.

I have not even swung a golf club in more than 2 months...how does that even happen?  So, in an effort to make myself look as foolish as possible, I decided that I a needed to tee it up at Lookout Mountain, the resort course at the Pointe Hilton at Tapatio Cliffs, for my comeback round:)  This sporty little course isn't very long (a little over 6500 yards from the tips), but don't let the lack of sheer yardage fool you... the course is a challenge, esp. played from the tips.  The driving areas are all relatively tight (you should only be thinking "driver" on 4 holes...all the rest need more precision than a driver will allow...at least for me:)  There are pretty views to distract you and claustrophobic tee boxes and sight lines to worry you, so that adds to the fun:)  There's definitely a reason this course is routinely ranked in the top 25 in Arizona and the top 400 in the US:)  Lookout Mountain has a very nice practice range near the first tee (which, in this interesting layout, is a mile away from the resort, main clubhouse and the bar:(  The course was in good shape (they have had problems from time to time with burnout on the greens, but not apparently this year:)  Service is exactly what you would expect from a good resort course...all the staff call you sir and they cannot wipe your clubs down often enough...they bring ice towels out to you on the course...the beverage cart girls are all pleasant and friendly and they have a charming little snack shack at the 10th tee...the highest point at the Pointe:)  From there, it's an entertaining little tee shot from a cliff onto a sidewalk that will set the tone for your back nine:)  Sadly, in the only thing that I don't really like about this place, you can't  sit at the bar and watch vanquished golfers stagger off the 18th green (which is always part of the fun:)...there's a "pro shack"/starters house at the18th green/range complex, but that doesn't get the job done.  In an effort to really turn my comeback round into something really ugly, I hit exactly 21 range balls and rolled 5 putts to warm up...after more than 2 months of no play:)  But, it all worked out and I managed to play my way around Lookout Mountain in fairly good order.  Give Lookout Mountain a try...they have some good rates (now that summer is here) for this entertaining little layout:)  Oh, my round...78, from the tips...ice cold:)   I am back, baby:)

I just 'droided myself and I'm not ashamed to admit it:)  I got my first cellular telephone in 1985...it took the better part of a day to install in my car, had a total weight of nearly 30 lb's and had to be bought as a separate item and then matched to the cellular provider (in this case McCaw Communications, the predecessor of CellularOne and ATT).  It cost more than $1,000 and that cost was surprisingly low compared to the Motorola "banana" phone I got a year later (a "pocket phone" if you had pockets that could accommodate a 3 lb., 12" x 5" phone:)  It was wonderful...I could talk and do business whether I was in my car, on my boat, out skiing or playing golf, in another city (all I had to do was pack my charger and spare battery...another 10 -12 pounds:)  I stayed with ATT until 2007 when my patience with poor signal and poor service finally ran out...that's right 22 years of patience...I'm like a camel of patience, apparently:)  I switched to Verizon and have never looked back:)  The first set of phones were state of the art a couple of years ago and the Beautiful Carin and I were very happy with them (in fact, my girl is now the queen...or maybe the crown princess...of texting...so fast! :)  Coverage was and is excellent (3G everywhere:)  It was time for my "new every 2" upgrade from Verizon, and I 'droided myself and Carin...no I didn't get any on anyone else:)  My kids all have iPhone's (and they think they are so much cooler than the old man), but I may have the last laugh...25,000 'droid apps and growning (all but a couple of dozen are free:)...much better coverage than ATT, access to all that crazy google stuff (even Doc's,  Voice and Wave work on the 'droid:)  Constant updates (I just got a text that Verizon will update the eris 'droid to android 2.0 in January:), and knowledgeable, organized and pleasant people whenever I go into one of their stores for accessories and what have you:)  Service was excellent, the upgrade was dead easy, and the phones were free...yup...free, and you know how I like a free 'droiding :-)

The Beautiful Carin and I had a wonderful Saturday evening at the Sunnyslope Art Walk. We had a nice dinner at Corbin's and as we were driving home, we talked about stopping for piece of pie. I like pie...it's not always about the cupcakes or gelato and ice cream, or even the éclairs and cannolis.  Sometimes it would just be nice to have piece of pie and cup of coffee. I was back east recently and it struck me that you can't walk 2 blocks in a lot of cities in the east without going by a decent diner where you can stop in and get a piece of pretty decent (maybe even homemade) pie and a cup of coffee...not here. We could only think of a couple of candidates...Village Inn or Marie Callender's (neither chain had we been to since we left California, in late 2003). Neither was really appealing, but the lure of pie is strong...too strong!  GPS said that Marie's was closest and on the way home. GPS did not say that this location stilled smelled of stale cigarette smoke from 2 years ago. GPS didn't tell me that the reason nobody was at this place at 9:00 in the evening was because it just isn't even very good pie, anymore (or, more probably, it isn't very good anything anymore). GPS tells me about traffic ahead and bad weather, but it just doesn't do a very good job of warning you about crappy restaurants! It was dark, kind of smelly and over air-conditioned in Marie's, but we pressed on regardless. Once seated, our waitress came by.  She didn't seem pleased to find out that we were only there for pie and coffee (I can understand...there only seemed to be 3 tables occupied in the entire place). She was however, pleasant, and for that I tipped big, since it looked like we were her best prospect for decent tip on Saturday. I believe that Marie's used to really think their claim to fame was their pies...I know they were touting "whole pies" in the signs as we walked in, but if this is still their big deal, then I am reasonably certain that I don't want anything to do with anything else they make/replicate/serve/unearth at Marie's.  The pie was no better than you would find wrapped in cellophane next to the cash register at Circle K. The coffee was even worse, if that's possible. Hard to say what happened, but the crust was dismal (I don't think I'm a pie snob, but the Beautiful Carin is a baker of the first order, and she makes a vodka crust...that's right, you heard me, vodka crust, you replace  1/2 of the water in your crust recipe with vodka...that's to die for, and I would hurt someone that tried to take one of Carin's pecan pies away from me...I actually growl like my dog: ).  The filling in Marie's pies was even worse than the crust...just way too sugary, with no flavor except "sweet" and no body at all. I like pie!  Sadly, this wasn't it.

I've been pretty lucky lately...not very much traveling:)  My luck has run out and now I get (get?!?!?!) to get back on the road a bit more than I would prefer.  http://tinyurl.com/ykbg5ws  I had to get some of my luggage back in shape...I buy pretty good stuff, (Andiamo, Tumi, etc.) but nothing lasts forever...esp. when entrusted to the gentle ministrations of the delightfully cavalier ladies and gentlemen that "handle" luggage for the various airlines that I use.  Think "angry male rottweiler vs. your leg" and you begin to get the picture about how your bags are treated:)  So I had to have some minor damage to my Andiamo Ro-Ro taken care of (and my Tumi gym bag was also in need of a couple of new zippers, etc...but it's 22 years old...I guess it was due:)  Re-sewed, re-zippered and re-newed...$34 US money for both bags:)  That's a lot less than a new Tumi Ro-Ro or new gym bag:)  One thing I learned back on the ranch...you have to make sure that you get every possible nickel's worth of good out of everything...so fix things rather than buy new stuff all the time...those may not be words to live by, but they allow me to think of myself as "sustainable" instead of "crazy old coot":)  It says something that I found out about this place from a buddy who flies left seat for SWA...this is where the flight crews go to get their bags fixed...and they seem to get more wear and tear on their luggage than I do:)  We've been using Marks since we got to town...when the Beautiful Carin's Kipling duffel bag broke in half, or her Ro-Ro needed "re-wheeling" who fixed it?   That's right, Marks:)  In fact, I would go so far as to say, that if they can't fix it, it really can't be fixed:)  If your bags are broken, your zippers won't zip, your wheelies won't wheelie and your handle doesn't, go see Marks...let them apply some some cheap, expert TLC to your luggage:)

I love Hooter's!!!! No, no, not the restaurant...it's really not the best dining experience, from a "good food" perspective.  Mr. Hooter founded his establishment (Hooter's) on the premise that a few chickens losing their wings so that we can happily dine on them and wash them down with beer is a good thing:) It probably is a good thing (chickens don't really need their wings...even the free range clucker's can't fly:), things are just not particularly well executed at Hooters.  Maybe it's the boobs who bought the place from Mr. Hooter that aren't living up to expectations. Still, the patrons were at Hooter's in force yesterday afternoon. What keeps them coming in droves? There must be something that keeps the clients (erstwhile diners?) coming in...could it be the charitable causes (I surmised that it's something about saving owls) that Mr. Hooter supported? I understand that Hooter's is all about support! Maybe it's the extraordinarily loud, yet incomprehensible music coming from the mis-synchronized speakers dotting the ceiling of Hooter's. I did notice that servers (all of whom seem to be young ladies in the full bloom of young lady-hood) all seem to kind of "groove" to the music, so they must like it:) Maybe it's the comforting bosom of Hooter's "sports bar" décor (funny signs, racks and racks of sports memorabilia, posters, etc., on the walls) that the Hooters client base yearns for. Nice artwork! Hard to say. I did notice that most of the diners were male, mid 30's to 60's and just sort of stared, glassy eyed (at the servers, not the food). That may help explain things. The Beautiful Carin called, out of the blue, and asked me out for lunch today:) What a nice surprise for me:) It was a perfect day for lunch, because I was ready to get out of the office for a while and see my girl. She suggested Hooter's (yeah, that's right...it wasn't me! :) We hadn't been to one for years, so we gave it a try.  She had a Cobb Salad with Chicken Breasts and I had a Chicken Breast Sandwich with a side of fried pickles (I have a Norwegian heritage...we never saw a vegetable or fruit that we didn't want to fry, boil, bake or distill:) It's funny that we both ordered something with Breasts...must have been "in the air". It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't really good...mediocre, pedestrian, ordinary are words that come to mind.  Even the pickles, which I had been wanting for a while. However, inexpensive is not a word that comes to mind...$36 for salad, sandwich, pickles and iced tea! I think we must be paying for ambiance.  I Love Hooter's!!!!! No, not the restaurant:)

When the Beautiful Carin and I lived back in the lovely Portland suburb of West Linn (what views from our house!...Mt. Hood, Mt. St. Helen's, the Willamette River and southeast Portland spread out below us...King of the World views! :), we had a neighbor that had approx. 117 miles of toy train track in his backyard!  He spent tens of thousands of dollars building, repairing, maintaining and expanding his train set (or "layout" as he liked to call it).  It was incredible...there were waterfalls, forests, mountains, cities...you name it...he had created a tiny alternative America, based on his vision of where the trains should go and what America should look like from the train:)  He was completely crazy...in a very nice way...but crazy never the less (and the main reason that I never wanted my money in US Bank, where he was a corporate EVP:)  We've all known somebody like that...and we've all looked at their trains and said, "Ooh, cool!"...we thought they were nice, but "ooh, cool"?...even I didn't think the backyard trains were cool, and I'm not the coolest guy on the planet...Scottsdale, maybe, but not the whole planet:)  MSRRP is like that backyard layout in the hills south of Portland, but ever so greatly enhanced and beamed to Scottsdale, complete with big train sets, BBQ pits and pavilions, acres of grass and patios to lie around on and (currently), a little music to listen to on Sunday evenings!  In this case, however, the layout wasn't built by that nutty banker in Portland...it was built by the son of a banker from Manhattan, Guy Stillman (I'll presume that Guy wasn't nutty, for the sake of this review...but...train sets).  Guy inherited his money from the McCormick Farm Implements family (isn't it great to have more money than you can possibly spend...it really lets you do some interesting things:), and he donated the park property, trains, etc. to the Scottsdale Railroad and Mechanical Society for a park for the city, along with some dough to keep things up!  Over the years, the Scottsdale Railroad and Mechanical Society have managed to use those gifts to craft one of the nicest little parks anywhere!  The park is always clean and well kept...the people who manage the parks are wonderfully nice and efficient...they are always adding new attractions, and they have plenty of shady places to sit, as well as nice clean places to get a burger or hot dog and a cold soda or an ice cream sandwich:)  I will go so far as to suggest that MSRRP is where you want to be on a lazy, late spring Sunday night:  * Watching all the parents and kids play catch and dance to the music and run and ride around the park * Watching the spontaneous bocce ball games break out over by one of the picnic pavilions * Spreading out your blanket for a Sunday picnic supper on the acres of lush lawns that make up the entire park * Listening to some really wonderful musical entertainment...for free...on the bandstand at the center of the park * Drinking a nice Malbec, while you listen to the band play and chat with the people on the next blanket * Looking up at the stars and letting the evening, the warmth, the comfort and the music wash over you  It's Americana, writ large...everything you think you want to remember about your youth is here...from the trains and acres of soft grass to run on, to the twilight picnic suppers and a band, playing up there on the bandstand in the middle of the park, helping you drift along on a wave of nostalgia.  A little more of the kind of entertainment and relaxation the MSRRP offers wouldn't hurt any of us:)

I really do love Goldmans. The only reason that i don't give them 5 stars, is that I get to NYC on business every month or 2 and get to go to Katz, Carnagie, Second St., etc., and get the real thing, and there is just nothing in Scottsdale (or Phoenix, for that matter) that really compares. The sandwiches are terrific and the soups are exceptional. I love the kreplach's in chicken soup, and the corned beef is really good...not too fatty but not dry, either. The pickles for the table leave a little to be desired (where is a good, puckery, salt brine pickle when you need one?) Carin had the chef salad and the chicken noodle soup and she thought it was really good, as well. I'm sure the desserts are good too, but after the cheesecake in NYC, the cheesecakes and other deserts at Goldman just don't look the same. I should try them before I say anything either way. The prices are good, under $20 for lunch for the 2 of us. We have been here 8-10 times since we moved back into Old Town from North Scottsdale, and I do think Goldman's is the best deli in town. BTW, I know Chompies has black and white cookies, but is there anybody else in town who makes them? I would like to find someplace to get one around town, rather than have to wait to go to New York to get a decent one.

Is it Five Star day or am I just in a good mood?  PF Changs...PeiWei...Teneko's...Flemings?  How does Fleming's fit in with the whole asian themed restaurant empire thingy that Peter Fleming put together?  I don't know...more importantly, I don't care...Fleming's Steakhouse is the best of the lot by my lights:)  Does Fleming's make the best steak in town?   Well no, the best steak in town comes off my grill, when I'm in the mood to grill:)  But I'm not always in the mood to grill my own steak and when I'm not, Flemings consistently puts a very solid medium rare Rib Eye ( with a little salad and a few string fries) right in front of me (along with a couple of well made Grey Goose marti's:)  They do it in a friendly style with  exemplary and easy going service in a warm and welcoming atmosphere...lighter décor than some of the very low lit/dark wood/red velvet steakhouses (BTW...not enough light to read the menu doesn't make the steak taste any better:)  Flemings has never done me wrong...  I have never felt "optimized" like I do at Ruth's Chris...I haven't felt that I overpaid for mediocre food like I do at Morton's or Mastro's...I never feel that I'm out of place when I show up wearing my shorts, sandals and golf shirt (exquisitely tailored, highly expensive shorts, sandals and golf shirt, but nevertheless:)  Flemings is a comfortable and pleasant place to grab a steak:)  The Beautiful Carin and I wandered over the other evening, intending to take advantage of the current Happy Hour specials (5 items for $6...5 wines, 5 cocktails and five small plates, each priced at $6...all of which are phenomenal, BTW:)  But after a couple of well crafted and astonishingly cold marti's, we decided we wanted dinner:)  I had the bone in Rib Eye and Carin had the New York Strip (my girl likes her steak:)  We split some shoestring potatoes and grilled asparagus:)  Everything was essentially perfect...a little too much food, but we took it home and DeeDee continues to believe that we are The Best People Ever:)  The next time you're in the mood for steak and you don't feel like heading out to your grill on a balmy 112 degree Scottsdale evening, put on your shorts and golf shirt, slide into your sandals, get comfy in a booth at Flemings and build yourself a $200 credit card bill.  Hey, I never said they were cheap...just good!

The Beautiful Carin and I went to dinner with one of my business partners and his wife tonight. They suggested Houston's, and my first thought was "no", but you know what? I'm glad we went there for dinner. I may have eaten at nearly every Houston's in North America over the past 15 years, and sometimes it just seems a little bit repetitious...it's the same menu in Minneapolis, Charlotte, Milwaukee, and Left Overshoe, Nebraska. But...I think that's the genius of it! I like their French Dip sandwich, I like their burgers, I like their ribs, I like their soups and salads, I like they way they pour a cocktail (perfect vodka martini tonight, BTW...ice cold...like a comforting fog made of vodka...mmmmm...vodka). Anyway, I realized that I like pretty much everything I've ever had at Houston's and that I can get pretty much everything I've ever had at A Houston's at THIS Houston's! Genius! The service is attentive and now that they take ressie's, the lengthy wait for a spot in the restaurant can be a thing of the past. I do have one small quibble with the service (and it really is a quibble). I just don't really like being interrupted during my second bite to be asked "is everything wonderful?" It's just kind of presumptuous to ask the "wonderful" part, in the first place, and the wonder doesn't really kick in until I've had a few more bites...then I will be happy to let you know it was wonderful! As I say, just a quibble...they were just trying to be sure we were happy...and we were! Finally, a word about sushi at Houston's...the word is "really?" I love sushi, but this may be the only thing on Houston's menu that I have not tried. I just think it's reaching. When I walk into a Houston's, "raw" and "fish" aren't top of mind. But, more sushi for you guys! All in all, Houston's (all the millions and millions of locations, but esp. you, local Scottsdale location) is a solid lunch and dinner spot. It won't cost you and arm and a leg for a really decent meal in a nice relaxing atmosphere. It may not be the greatest grub you'll ever have, but it's pretty damn good! Thanks for getting me out there tonight, partner!

The Beautiful Carin and I met the adorable Christina P. for a wine tasting event at Bacchus a couple of weeks ago and we had a wonderful evening out (I know, I just wrote "a couple of weeks ago"...I'm late in getting this written...in my defense, and as anyone who has read any of my reviews will tell you, writing these reviews isn't my day job:) Christina had tickets for a Pinot tasting event at Bacchus and neither Carin nor I had been in there before (walked by enough times, I don't know why we didn't stop in). It was good chance to try it out with a friend. It was really a nice event, made nicer  by the chance to get to know Christina P. better and share a little wine and some nibbles. While we just sampled a selection of Pinot's (the Adelsheim Vineyards Pinot was the best, IMHO...Go Oregon Pinot's! :), Bacchus has a strong selection and really good prices!  We talked to the owners a little bit and they are certainly aware of the recession and have adjusted their pricing and emphasis accordingly. In addition to the wines, Bacchus provided a selection nuts, chips, sausages and cheeses to compliment the wine (it was real treat being with Christina...she really knows her wines and what makes them tick...she also really knows how to assess how a wine will pair up with a given food...it was really fun to learn some of these things:) We added another plate of cheeses and meats (we were hungry:), including a truly delightful and hearty sharp white cheddar...I could have made a meal of that cheese...actually, maybe I did...I don't remember Christina or Carin getting much of the cheese! After the tasting, we wandered over to the Cheesecake Factory and finished off the evening with cheesecake and cobbler. Wine, cheese and cheesecake...does it really get any better? :)

I have been racking my brain to think of nice things to say about Morton's:  * They plastic wrap they use on the "selection tray" is very shiny:)  * They have single malt scotch:)  * The lighting is very low if you have light sensitivity problems:)  * The steaks are better than the steaks at Lonestar or Outback or the buffet at Eagles Nest in the casino:)  I want to say something nice, because that's how I was raised.  But I'm having trouble.  Was the food really bad?...Well, no it wasn't a horror show...although medium rare isn't that hard to achieve...I shouldn't have to put up with an over cooked steak (I don't like to send food back when dining with clients...doesn't send the right message)  Was the service inept or ill-mannered?...Not really, although being asked if everything is "to my liking" after every third bite can become cloying (I suppose it's in the manual somewhere:)  Was the bill really that bad?...Well, my prospective clients actually took me to dinner, so I didn't pay, but I did see the bill...$460 for the three of us, so not as much as some but for that kind of dough I do expect a better meal:)  Morton's seem to have become the McDonald's of steakhouses (as contrasted with Ruth's Chris...the Burger King of steakhouses:)  They are safe...  You won't get the wildly uneven results that you'll find with say...a Mastro's location:)  You always know where the toilet is:)...and the bar:)...and the coat room:)...and etc.:)  You always know where the rib-eye is located on the "selection tray":)  But the preparation of the food is pedestrian, the presentation is uninspired, the sides are uninspiring and the whole feel is formulaic and dated:(  I do expect more at this price point and Morton's just doesn't deliver these days:(  So, just like MickieD's, I only go to Morton's these days, when I am dragged (or is it "drugged":)  Are there worse dining experiences?...oh you bet...we could still be dealing with The Pink Taco:)

Saturday was a busy, busy day!  There were so many moving parts to my day:  * I rode my mountain bike to Tempe to see the Tour de Fat:)  * I had to play Squash at the club:)  * I had football on the TiVo that really needed my attention:)  * Oh yeah, Carin had a pretty big photo shoot that she was managing, and she asked me to help her with "model wrangling" for a little while...(she didn't call it that...she's far more refined than I am...she asked me to help sign people in and make sure they got where they needed to be...but I call it "model wrangling":-)  Where do I get the energy? :)  After a busy day, it was time for a dinner party with the photographer, the owners of the business, and selected guests from the shoot...interesting people and a wonderful mix for great conversation...which makes for a great dinner party:)  Hiro Sushi had been selected for the party and they did not disappoint:)  Hiro San has been a sushi master since 1968 and knows his way around a sushi bar (as do all of his assistant chefs:)  Hiro likes his boats, and all the sushi, sashimi and rolls were delivered to the table in traditional sushi boats...that's presenting your fish old school...and I approve (I have too...I went to an old school...back in olden days:)  Fresh tasting and delicious, the food came in waves ebi, maguro, iki, ikura, uni and anago, along with Arizona Roll (vegetarian...not my favorite), Caterpillar Roll and Spider Roll while we all enjoyed Kirin and hot and cold sake:-)  Hiro doesn't really have a party room, but they created a nice little spot for us all and we all laughed and talked and drank and ate and it was just a wonderful night.  We've been to Hiro before and the food and service are always top notch:)  The ambience in the restaurant is a little bit pedestrian...it kind of feels to me like a strip mall sushi bar (which it is, although the food is an order of magnitude better than most strip mall sushi:)  And creativity isn't really Hiro's strong suit...good and fresh sushi always, but not always presented as art.  Does that make a difference?...I don't know for sure...it can be an important part of the equation for me:)  That said, I like Hiro's...a lot:)  A lot better than I like model wrangling...it's really not my cup of dirty chai latte....it was like herding cats...pretty, pretty cats:)

A friend suggested that we play golf at Starfire, little (short) resort style course on Hayden in Scottsdale. I don't want to get off on a rant here, but will someone (other than me...I did tell them but the blank stares I encountered lead me to believe that my diatribe was ineffective and possibly not even understood by the staff at Starfire) tell them to give the Armor All a rest! I suppose the course is nice enough...I've played there many times since I moved to town. I suppose the prices are reasonable...I have certainly paid more to play a course in worse condition. So why the one star for a place called Starfire? Somebody needs to tell the morons in the cart barn or out in the staging area to give the Armor All a rest!!!!! I appreciate a pretty, shiny golf cart as much as the rest of hacking community...but don't spray it all over the cart...and don't spray it so it drips places where I will put my hands!!!! Once the still wet Armor All gets on your hands, you are done golfing until you: A - get some solvent to get this crap out of all the little ridges and cracks in my hands...not good...it took 2 days, and; B - Get a good golf shop to re-grip ALL of your golf clubs to the tune of approx. $100 You cannot play golf if you can't hang onto the club and with Armor All on your hands, you literally (and I don't mean figuratively...I literally mean literally) cannot hold onto a golf club and swing it...it just won't be happening. I quit after 3 holes. No satisfaction when I asked for a refund or some sort recompense (they did offer me a cart which wasn't dripping with Armor All, but the damage was done by then). I doubt I'll spend my golfing dollars there again.

The Beautiful Carin and I needed some new TV's for the new place at the beach.  What...did you think we were just going to sit there and watch the ocean?  No, we need our TiVo, our college football, our Hawaii 5-0 and our MadMen, just like everyone else.  And we need them wirelessly in every room, with incredible sound and in 3D/HDTV!  So it was time to re-up on the television front.  It turns out that it's actually cheaper to buy the TV's and all the attendant crap here in Arizona (and have our mover take them along), than it is to buy them and have them delivered in California!  I know, it seems crazy to me too, but when you are buying four of these bad boys at one time...well, the discount did not hurt my feelings, one iota!  We dropped by this location after breakfast on Sunday..."just to look over our options"...but I'd already done my research, done a little online looking, dropped by Best Buy, Fry's and Costco and I knew what I wanted and about how much it was going to cost me.  Imagine my surprise, when Chris, the nice sales guy ran the numbers for us and the total turned out to be about $1,000 less than I thought it was going to cost me!  Delivery was right on time, everything showed up intact and as soon as the installers finish and we finish our move, I won't need to look outside for anything...ever again!  The whole world will be available in 3D-HiDef...all 13 movies of currently available 3D content.  In a final "nice touch", I had no sooner gotten off my plane today than my pocket rang (and vibrated...I do so enjoy my very smart phone)...it was Chris calling to make sure that the delivery was smooth, and that I got everything I had purchased...going the extra mile!  UE made it easier to part with my money...easier, not "easy".

Rock Bottom...Well, that pretty much sums it up:)  Thanks!!  You've been a great audience!!  Don't forget to tip your wait staff (the only part of Rock Bottom worth a little applause:)  I'm not much of a beer drinker, so that part of this chains "allure" is really lost on me.  I said in an earlier review that some chains are better than others (or something to that effect:)  This is one of the chains that they are better than:)  The food here could sure be better...really:)  I had lunch meeting at RBB today (nope, I didn't get to pick, but that may change in the future based on this swing and a miss:)  I had their lunch special sliders...as dry and lifeless a rack of mini-burgers as I have seen lately (and that includes the mini-"sirloins" available at your local Jack in the Hat:(   The lunch included a stack of overly greasy fries...just not much worth trying to eat in this "special"...but what can I expect for $6.95?  My lunch companion had something that was supposed to be the shrimp enchilada lunch special...also $6.95...I would have to say that based on her reaction, the execution of said "enchilada" dish was somewhere short of "successful":(  Isn't there supposed to be "shrimp" in "shrimp enchilada"? No?  Maybe we shouldn't expect more for this kind of price point, but damn it...I do!  Were they having an off day?   I don't know, but it was a poor effort on the part of the kitchen (I can't speak to the brewery part...they may have been crushing it today:)  You know, we could have gone across the freeway to Vermont Sandwich or Andreoli and had a much better meal for roughly the same price!  Maybe if they changed the restaurant format to "Rock Bottom Scotch Distillery" it could bring me back.  Oh, and if the food was better:)

Alert the media!!! Ted's is one of the Top Ten hot dog shops in the galaxy!!...Ted's is on the Travel Channel!!...Ted's is really authentic, because they are from Buffalo NY, the home of the Buffalo Bills football team (in an interesting side note, everybody thinks the Bills are named after "Buffalo Bill", the cowboy showman...but "Bills" is an acronym for "Boy I Love Loosin' Superbowls"). I learned most of this standing in lines at Ted's over the years (not the Bills trivia...they love their Bills at Ted's and you would do well not to question that or to make sport of the Bills, as I just have:) Why is Buffalo the home of the best hot dogs, you ask?  Well, don't ask...it just is...as far as you know. Ted's created the Tempe outpost a few years ago when the owner of Ted's got tired of shoveling 24 feet of lake effect precipitation off of his driveway every winter and needed to have a way to write off the trip west every year. So he packed up his sausages and some plaques and Buffalo newspaper clippings for the wall and landed in Tempe, AZ:) It's our good fortune, really.  I doubt we'll get the Papaya King to relocate to the Valley of the Sun, and I'm pretty sure Pinks will stay put, so this may be the closest we'll get to galactic class hot dogs. And yet, they're just hot dogs.  Good hot dogs, yes...and I do like them...but just hot dogs. The dogs (and everything that they cook at Ted's) are open flame broiled over a real charcoal fire, with the standard compliment of condiments available (including chili, although I am not a big fan of Ted's chili dogs...the chili just doesn't grab me). They also do a nice job on brats, white hots, polish sausages, etc.  And, I understand the hamburger is decent, although I have never had one...I go to Ted's for one reason and one reason only...the stars of the show...the hot dogs! And I'm not the only one...people do, indeed, line up to get these dogs! It's like trying to get a pizza at Bianco's.  In fact, Ted's can be a tougher test of your dining will than Bianco's...to wit:  * Wait      o Bianco's - 2-3 hours, but you can sit at a table and drink and eat      o Ted's - You must stand in line for the full hour...no cuts!!!  * Ordering      o Ted's - you better be ready or be prepared for a bit of a public dressing down ("sir, are you ready? Ma'am, the menu is right up there!! sir, other people are waiting!!)      o Bianco's - "You want what on that pizza?!?! Chris will not make "his" pizza that way"! "Did you get my wine and cheese order Mr. Shaved Head-non-responsive bartender at Bar Bianco...hello...hello"? "Yes, I know I told you check with me every hour during the wait, but now that's annoying me"  * Price      o Ted's - 2 foot longs and diet coke for $11? That better be a hot dog made with sausage imported all the way from Buffalo, NY! Oh, right...it is:)      o Bianco's - $15 for a pizza that I can't even get my way after a 3 hour wait and $150 bill for wine cheese from your shop next door! This pizza better be made with buffalo mozzarella, made by hand, by you! Oh, right...it is:)  For the local "Best in the Universe-Peasant Food Division", Ted's certainly gives the pizza joint a run for its money, in pretty much every category:) Give them try, but bring your comfortable shoes and something to read in line (unless you'd enjoy reading 3 week old Buffalo, NY newspapers from Ted's reading rack)...and for the pete's sake be ready to order!

I play squash racquet's, a sport favored by the east coast "elites" from them Ivy League schools, those snooty Britishers and the Pakistani leisure class:)   Why they let me play, I'll never know:)  Last evening, we had a little tourney in which a group of us from the Village traveled to the outer reaches of Tempe to play a group from Lifetime Fitness:)  It was a jolly good, show, ever so much fun and our Village group gave the Lifetime group a bit of a "Rodgering":)  So it was with happy hearts and high spirits that we headed down the street to the post tourney repast at Skip & Jan's...let me start by saying that the Lifetime group picked this place, and it's almost like they knew they were going to lose and wanted to select a venue that would be the grimiest, greasiest, grubbiest, grossest spot to try to eat...they succeeded:)  Where to start...I know...the parking lot:)  When we arrived, the total Kelly Blue Book value of the 50-60 cars in the parking lot was about $832...we raised that by several orders of magnitude, just by driving in...this parking lot hasn't seen a lot of traffic from the Mercedes/BMW/Lexus/Jaguar crowd (and may never again:)  After I safely parked a block or 2 away, I went inside and took in the look and feel of S&J...crappy old wood paneling...tables and chairs from a circa 1955 high school cafeteria...an intriguing mix of flat panel TV's, regular TV's and OTB results screens (yeah, you can bet the ponies here...the sport of Kings, in a slightly less than "regal" atmosphere:)  They must have 20-25 pool tables...faded felt...and a whole bunch of people playing pool (and frankly looking like they weren't enjoying themselves...extremely tight and serious expressions on the faces of the people playing and watching...aren't games supposed to be fun? :-)...I suspect there was gambling going on:)  The smell in S&J can only be described as "extreme humanity"...the place smelled like it has seen a century's worth of spilled beer, cigarette smoke, BO, vomit, urine, spoiled food and every other aroma that humans create for themselves...remarkable, given the fact that this place can't have been here for more than a few years...how did they do that so quickly? :-)  S&J has menus, they have some sort of kitchen, they have Jagermeister on "tap", they have a bunch of beers on tap and they had a buffet (or "boofay" for my friend Ryan C) set up for our group.  It was supposed to be a Taco Bar:)  S&J provided a table full of taco "fixin's"...the centerpiece of which was the taco meat hot tray...Holy Crap, was that disgusting! :-(  They told us it was ground beef, but I know my beef, and I don't think this was it...this was ground "creature"...possibly some sort of unfortunate non-distinct animal which happened to be near the kitchen when duty called.  I kid, of course...as far as I know, this was indeed, "beef"...just not very good "beef":(  The hot tray holding the "meat" looked like a relief map of the Hawaiian Islands...small mountains of "meat" rising out of the ocean of brown/orange grease that was the real body of the dish:(  But, I was starving (a banana for breakfast and nothing else) so I tried to make a taco.  I decided to forgo the slotted spoon that everyone was trying to use to fish some meat out of the soupy brine, and use some tongs instead...my idea was to try to squeeze as much grease out of the concoction as possible...I was sort of successful, but in doing so, I probably squeezed any flavor out as well:(  I got back to the table and tried a bite...not good...I added several shakes of Cholla and tried another bite...and that was that:(  One of my buddies had decided to forgo the mystery meat tacos and ordered wings from the menu and offered me one...I'm not sure what the deal with the wings was, but the wing I tried seemed to be boiled (no, not "broiled"...boiled) and then dipped in buffalo sauce...not crispy, just wet...all the way through:)  Then they announced that Karaoke was going to start soon...and that was enough for me:(  Adding amateur singing to this tableau would have just been too much:)  Still, it's not all bad news...the tires and wheels were still on my car when I was ready to leave...I didn't become immediately ill (although I had kind of a rough morning, this morning).  They say shared adversity can make teams grow together, so I think I should thank S&J for making the Village Squash group nearly invincible:)

It's easy to like the things that everybody else likes.  It's human nature to want to be loved and to want to be accepted.  Deep in our DNA, we are still pack animals (as in "a scrum of rugby's", as opposed to pack animals as in "pack all that crap on that animals back and let's go"). My sense of needing to belong was what brought me to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles a few years ago, and my sense of "I haven't had a decent chicken and waffles fix for a while" brought me back today! You won't see me wax rhapsodic over the flavor and lightness of the perfectly crusty and delectable fried chicken...I won't fawn over whoever is in the kitchen turning out delicious waffle after delicious waffle. I can't sit here all afternoon and go on and on about the many delectable sides like the buttery and cheesy grits, the melt in your mouth fried okra, and the gallons and gallons of sweet tea or homemade lemonade that you can consume with your lunch at Lolo's. It's not the interesting menu items like fried gizzards, and fish and grits, that you just can't get other places that stir my soul. I'm not moved to hyperbole (pronounced "high-per-bowl":) by the blending of sweet maple syrup, buttered waffles and savory fried chicken on the plate. I am not reduced to tears by some of the best red velvet cake to come out of an oven in the greater Phoenix Area. No, it's the people at Lolo's that make me go back, and the sense of belonging and of being one of the Lolo's "pack"...that and some of the best fried chicken, waffles, grits and cake that you will ever eat. Go to Lolo's...you're family, you should drop by once in a while:)

I have been craving Vietnamese food for a while. I used to go 2-3 times a month to a little place In Oakland, CA when I lived in SFO and got addicted.  I had tried a couple of places here in Scottsdale 2-3 years ago with less than satisfactory results. I don't remember the names of the places, but they just weren't very good (I seem to remember not very fresh vegatables and greens, and a lack of cleanliness). I had lunch with some of my buddies today and they suggested Maxim. It was very good. I had beef noodles and a chicken spring roll and everything was fresh and tasty. The broth for the noodle was fragrant and rich. It took the cilantro, sprouts, etc., and added them easily to the overall flavor. While the place is a "hole in the wall" in a lackluster little strip mall, it is very clean, the service is quick and friendly and the prices are very good, esp. given the quality and amount of food, and quality and freshness of the sprouts, cilantro, basil, corriander, etc., that can be added. Great little spot!

Sweet basil, this place is good!! :-)  I think that's going to be my new "catch phrase"..."Sweet Basil", etc.:)  If I want to add emphasis, I can insert an adjective..."Sweet Aromatic Basil", etc.:)  What do you think?...No?...OK:)  But, Maxim still has about the best Vietnamese food around:)  After a workout this morning (to nullify the effects of the UYE at Haus Murphy's last night) I met a bunch of my attorney buddies for a sort of healthy lunch today (BTW, I realize, that sounds like an oxymoron..."attorney buddies", not "healthy lunch":)  They are a jolly crew...always laughing and giggling about the misery visited upon the rest of society by the legal profession and its handmaidens, health care and insurance:)  We laughed and talked and ate, ate and laughed...soon, very soon,  karma will pay a visit, but for now, they are jolly and entertaining lunch companions (not to mention invaluable resources for that inevitable day when my own legal misery strikes-:)  Maxim is more reliable than an attorneys billing logs (and significantly more tasty and less expensive:)  I generally have #20, the rare beef pho with rice noodles, and a chicken spring roll...hearty broth, real beef (not bits and pieces:) and plenty of it:)  Add your own heat (and there are plenty of options for that) as well as sprouts, basil, peppers, etc., and you've engineered a pretty decent lunch...that doesn't cause retox...probably:)  The service is always good here (insert legal joke about "service" here)...and to top it off, the whole crew at Maxim are just very nice people...I think they are mostly family and they treat all of their customers great!...We were greeted with a smile and a smile and wave when we left:-)  Sweet Basil, that's good food:-)

If you're looking for the best mole' in town, it might just be hiding at Pepe's Taco Villa. I hadn't been to PTV before (it not really in my neighborhood walking radius...I clock it at just under 22 miles round trip). It might be worth the trip:) I've certainly tried the mole's in a lot of places, and some are pretty decent...I know mole' is a style thing, more than an absolute (the "right" amount of chocolate...the right "umami", etc., so when I say that Los Sombrero's mole' is kind of "mediocre" and the mole' at Frank and Lupe's (which used to be pretty decent) would now be better if they just poured a can of unsweetened Hershey's syrup over chicken tartare...you know I mean those minor critiques with love:) I played squash on Saturday...(squash, the sport of the privileged and effete East Coast elite intelligentsia, who would be dismayed (to put it mildly) to find me playing "their" game:) I played in an event to raise money to make squash an Olympic sport in a few years (yeah, I know...good luck with that, but if they have fencing, why not?) After playing for over an hour straight (best anaerobic sport on the planet...burns more than 1400 calories an hour)...I was hungry! My erstwhile opponent, Wes, the affable and probably not corrupt attorney, suggested PTV.  Wes's wife went to high school with the owners and he said they had great mole's. 3 chicken mole' enchiladas later, I am inclined to agree.  Wes and the family (I'm like an uncle to those kids...Uncle Buck:) chatted with Jose, one of the owners, when we arrived and I got a chance to say "hello" too. I got a little bit of the history of the place...used to be owned by the parents, used to be smaller and more intimate (something I always like in a taco shop...PTV isn't small any longer). We got chips and salsa...pretty good chips and better salsas, although the 2 kinds of salsa came in squeeze bottles (I am really more of a "dunker" than "squeezer" when it comes to salsa...it was fine...you just have to make a little volcano of both kinds of salsa and use 2 chips to push things around...but I don't really like to have to work the chip thing that hard:) The enchiladas came and heavens to murgatroid, they were tasty!!!  Pronounced chocolate flavor, not too salty, with the just the right amount of bitterness from the unsweetened Mexican chocolate:) The chocolate blended with the grilled chicken flavor and the sweetness of the corn tortillas to produce an outstanding enchilada.  I also ordered the Olla beans...highly recommended!  You can get refries anywhere and I doubt that PTV's are significantly (or any) better than others.  But they put a bunch of jalapeno's in the pot to make these pot beans a cut above the rest:) They say that chocolate accesses the same brain chemistry that sex does, and I think that might have been the case with my enchilada's:) But, I was there with Wes and his family...they were kind enough to invite me along and show me where to get good mole'...a full on foodgasm would have just been wrong...even for me:)

TBC has become a bit of a Scottsdale landmark over the past few years...I use it as a navigation landmark when I have people meeting me in town.  "Go north on Scottsdale Road and if you see 75 hung over people dressed in Affliction tee shirts and sequined mini-dresses, standing on a street corner waiting for a mediocre breakfast, you've gone too far...in so very many ways".  I live (for another few weeks, at any rate) pretty close to TBC and yet, I don't really "go to there" very often (or at all) if I can avoid it.  I just don't look good in Affliction...or a sequined mini-dress.  In addition, the food and service have left me cold (much like my last omelet at TBC a few weeks ago) on my infrequent visits.  But the amusement factor provided by TBC is (for me at least) quite high, and for that, I'm grateful!  I've been twice in the past year...once for lunch, out of renewed curiosity (I was headed to another spot for lunch and saw a couple reading a menu outside another restaurant and discussing their lunch preferences in loud Scottish accents "I dinna want a fookin TACO, Angela...I wanna go to the fookin Breakfast Club!").  That was almost a year ago...and I went once for breakfast, recently, because the Beautiful Carin likes TBC.  And what Carin wants, Carin gets!  But both visits featured mediocre food (esp. for the price) and mediocre service (at any price).  My last visit also featured an apparently broken exhaust duct that runs under the booths at the north end of the place.  Hot, humid cooking exhaust, coming up through the seams in the upholstery, steamy cooking aroma's wafting around me from below...I was about to call Guinness because I thought I was setting a new world record for sustaining a fart!  But the aromatic breeze didn't stop!   And even though I'm close to senility, I eventually realized that it wasn't me!  Our server was uninterested in this turn of events (when I let her know what was happening)...apparently I'm past the age when a 22 year old "model" (who happens to be slingin' hash) needs to pay any attention to me...even when they are theoretically being paid to do so!  Maybe she wasn't being paid enough to listen to me...that's probably why some hookers get $2-3,000 an hour...to listen...bareback.  At any rate, I was going to add a star to my review, since the warm air enema felt so darn nice, but what other restaurant can compete with that?  It wouldn't be fair!  TBC is clearly a club that doesn't need me as a member, and I'm OK with that.

I am a spring training fan! That's not to say that I am a big baseball fan...I don't care who wins and I don't care about players stats, the stars of the game or any of the other things that surround the game. I don't even care about the steroids scandal in baseball...if some illiterate multimillionaire thinks that injecting certain substances in his/her body to enhance their performance is worth it, then I'm the last guy to tell them not to do it (although the late Lyle Alzedo might have had a different perspective). What I love, is a beautiful day at the ball park, watching a game that I enjoyed playing when I was a kid, in the company of the beautiful Carin. The best place to do that is Scottsdale Stadium, on the grass berm (no, not the stands or the Chorro Lodge...that just takes away from the atmosphere). Get there reasonably early, spread out a blanket on the grass, chitchat with the other fans, enjoy the people watching (really, too much fun...real baseball fans, drunk guys looking for girls, girls all decked out looking for guys...the show is terrific!). The game is always kind of fun to watch, as well. In the early part of the season, some of these "pro's" look like my kid when he played T-Ball! The food can be pretty good, too. I know it's pricey but that's not unusual for going to the ball park, and you can always grab something to eat before or after the game, since this stadium is close to a bunch of decent places. They do have some of the better ballpark food here at Scottsdale stadium, from both the concession stands hosted by the stadium and the booths set up by some of the restaurants in the area. At any rate, the show and the ambiance are the things that make this a 5 star experience. Go, lie on the grass, people watch, party and enjoy!

Dense Rich Creamy Intense Complex Strong Buttery  Yes, those are all words that describe me...almost to a "T"...well, not creamy, really:)  But these words also describe the gelato classico at Gelato Old Town (wow is that a name that needs help, or what? :-)  Gelato Old Town (let's shorten that up a bit, shall we...GOT!) is hidden away under some hay bales, unsold sombreros, leftover turquoise and cowboy boots in a section of Old Town that I like to call "almost neverland" because I almost never go to there:)  I should..it is close to the Mission, with their hilariously priced guac, and OTFM.   I use to wander over more often when Pischke's was Pischke's, but not so much anymore (how many cowboy hats and "Scottsdale Rules!!" tee shirts does one man really need?).  I hadn't been in to GOT in while and after lunch today (no, I made myself lunch, even though it is Taco Tuesday) I needed a little sweet treat and took myself out for a walk to GOT.  They may have the densest gelato I've ever had...it took power tools to scoop it out of the bins and into the cup...and not just because they keep the gelato at appox. 0 degrees:)  I test drove the strawberry, the butter caramel and the chocolate chip...all of them handmade/housemade and all of them winners:)  I forked over $4.50 for the medium sized cup of chocolate chip...such an intense vanilla flavor, contrasted with flakes of intense dark chocolate...nicely done:)  Unlike some of my treat expenditures, I didn't regret one red cent of this one!  Sweet, but not too sweet, the flavors, the extreme coldness of the gelato all blended perfectly:)  I wandered over to the park (my original destination...the gelato was a happy afterthought:) and sat in the shade by a fountain for while, savoring the warm afternoon and my delightful sweet treat:)  Brave souvenir row in Old Town and give these guys a try...it will make you happy:)

Did I miss the crappy service/attitude memo?  I started out in a such a good mood!  By 12:30, I'd already been grinding away on the gears of my life for almost 8 hours...including the sporty little run along the canal this morning...I needed a retox.  I decided to head through the park to get to lunch today because...well...it's a beautiful day and it's a beautiful park...maybe get a gelato after lunch, for my sweet treat!  Sadly, I was in a significantly less "good mood" when I got to GOT for my sweet treat (after a pedestrian/car altercation and a poorly served and unfortunate lunch)...in fact, you could say I had shifted to "cranky".  GOT's door was locked (not the first time this happened when they are supposedly "open") and the woman behind the counter was yelling to me through the window to "come back in 30 minutes"...at lunch hour...on a warm spring afternoon...really?  I mouthed "What?" at her and cupped my hand to my ear, like I didn't understand, so she repeated herself...and I said "What?" again and then, tiring of my little game, I left with a wave that said "I will be taking my gelato business to G-Spot for the foreseeable future".  I'm writing a memo that no one will read about all of this, as we speak.

http://tinyurl.com/447vcn  Just sit right back and you'll read a tale, a tale of a crappy bar; Good for me, it's pretty close, I didn't walk too far; The food is poor, and the service is not very good, (it's bad!); We went to eat at happy hour, instead the hour was sad.  My mate is a pretty special girl, she said "let's try this out"; 5 people were inside the joint,  For Giligin's Happy Hour... For Giligin's Happy Hour...  The music blared throughout the joint, so loud that it caused pain; On grimy tables, floors and chairs,  We tried to chat in vain... We tried to chat in vain...  This place is not my favorite bar; I wouldn't hang out there;  With Giligin; The waitresses; The "thousandairres", and their friends; The "You Tube Stars"; and the rest...they all can have my share:)

All I can say is "Thank You" Heather and Ryan C!!! Heather wrote a glowing review of this place. When I ran into Heather and Ryan at Brackin's on Wednesday night, they waxed rhapsodic about the pleasures of this place...really, they almost lapsed into prose to extol the virtues of the "date milkshake"...I sort of thought that "date milkshake" must be some sort of euphemism for something far more exotic:) It just couldn't be that a dried fruit based confection could move sane and rational Yelpers to near tears of joy! I walked in to this place yesterday, intending to try it myself and see about this "date milkshake"...I walked out with $50 worth of salsas, nut's, dates and pickled beans. Oh, and one of the best freaking milkshakes I have ever had! Astonishing!!

I'm currently in the middle of a rigorously controlled scientific experiment...it involves subjecting a "youngish" middle aged man to periods of intense physical exercise to "detoxify" him and then "retoxifying" him with things like Long Wong hot dogs and wings, mere moments later:)  After Power Yoga on Friday, I really needed to "tox up" and I met a buddy at Long Wongs.  I had my standard...2 Long Wongs and a frosty diet beverage, and my buddy got a dozen spicy and a dozen teryaki wings (and I thought I could eat:)  I had not tried the wings before, so I did end up "helping" to dispose of them:)  I am not generally a major fan of wings, but these little chicken parts were really good...esp. the teryaki wings...wonderfully deep teryaki flavor and a nice heat to go with it:)  And, in a major coup for a real "hole in the wall" kind of place...they proudly display the "Gold Award  - Zero Violations" from their last health inspection...I always knew they were clean as whistle...even though I can still smell the urinal cakes:)   Let's take them to 4 stars for the terrific teryaki wings:-)

After a busy morning, what with work, a sporty little run along the canal (good news...no floating bodies and no one jumping out of the bushes, trying to decapitate me this morning...yay!) and all the other attendant details of my life, I needed to get retoxed for a busy afternoon!  And today, with time being in short supply, I turned to my background in mathematics and science and revised the question of "how should I retox?" to "what is the most toxic thing I can eat for lunch and survive?"  The answer, my friends, is the Double Down from KFC!  Like all of you, I am a sucker for a well executed television commercial...and KFC's ad for this one has it all...large, beefy men eating a Double Down and admiring the "no bun/all meat" approach to sandwiching...nubile young women looking at them consuming said Double Down in a demur, yet admiring fashion...the subliminal messages that flash for a millisecond or so and implant the KFC craving so deep in our brains that it resides right next to religion and sexual preference in the subcortex...a completely "hindbrain" event...off I went!  The Double Down appeals to the 400 pounder living in all of us...double "bacon", wrapped in double "cheese", surrounded by double "chicken" (I use quotes around those words because I'm pretty sure that no actual pigs or chickens were harmed in order for me to have lunch...and the "cheese" was, well, let's just call it "petroleum based cheese-like food product").  http://tinyurl.com/67lxpl  The smiling men of the KFC lunch shift greeted me as I walked in and I had my Double Down and Diet Coke (HAHAHAHA...I know...Diet Coke) about 12 seconds after I paid for it.  It was as advertised...2 pieces of chicken (with no pesky bones to slow down your munching and gnashing), the bacon and cheese and some sort pinkish mayo in a wax paper wrapper.  The chicken part of the sandwich could have used either another minute or 2 in the fryer or a minute or 2 less in the warming trays...the breading was either under cooked or over greased (the fact that it was difficult to determine tells you pretty much everything you need to know about the quality of the "sandwich").  It just wasn't very good...and I didn't see any attractive young ladies gazing at me admiringly as I hoovered down this little gullet greaser.  540 calories (not that I watch that), 32 grams of fat (or lube, as I like to think of it), 1380 milligrams of sodium (I've seen salt licks back on the the cattle ranch with less than that) and 11 grams of dietary fiber (more lube).  The science behind this "sandwich" says I should typing this from the great beyond right now...but the sweet balance of my life...the detox/retox...the yin and the yang, all combine to keep me safe and reasonably healthy!  But don't try this at home...I am a trained professional!

How can they keep giving  away candy?  This place is an anachronism...a look back at better days...easier days:)  A step back in time to the days when you could sit at the lunch counter at Woolworth's and have an open face turkey sandwich at the counter, brought to you by a nice lady in sky blue waitress uniform:)  Here the uniforms are white and the ladies behind the counter aren't bringing turkey sandwiches...they are handing you candy...sweet, sweet candy:)  How could we not love them and their sweet and clean candy stores?  I know I'm not the one to resist them and their proffer of delightful and chocolaty treats.  We still had a "hankerin'" for a little something after lunch today and strolled up the street to See's.  We were just going to look...in theory...but the problem is, that when you walk in, you smell the chocolate, these angels in white offer you chocolate (sometimes more than one:), and the next thing you know, you are walking down the street with 6 lb's. of Bordeaux creams, truffles, peanut butter crunch and fudge:)  You've been hypnotized by the clean white store, the uniforms, the aromas and free samples:)  Are the chocolates Knipschildt, DeLaffee or even Godiva, no...but they are good and  none of those other guys have the ladies in white handing out samples:-)  Swing on by and have a free sample...you know you want to:)

How does a fork roar? There is a certain zen quality to that question, much like the ever popular "if a tree falls, yada-yada" (I know, it's not really yada-yada, but you get the idea). I have been to several restaurants lately named with utensil based nomenclature, or named after the place in which the meal was prepared (Kitchen, Wok, etc.).  I fully expect that trend to continue, but I think it shows a certain lack of imagination. Sometimes that can be helpful, like "Jimmy's BBQ Pit"...I know it's likely to be BBQ.  Simply "Jimmy's Pit" or "Jimmy's" or "Pit" wouldn't be helpful (well, "Pit" might tell you avoid the place). But generally, I like a little romance in the naming...a little something to pique my interest (having said that I still think the food at Hooters is just not up to the name, but that's a discussion for another time). The Beautiful Carin and I headed over to the Roaring Fork for Happy Hour a couple of nights ago and spent a lovely evening at the bar with Clark, the bartender/server/happy hour ambassador.  The bar is the place to have a happy hour dinner and couple of cocktails. Tables are fine, but the bar is just a better atmosphere!  We hadn't been back for happy hour since Bob McGrath sold the place, but it really hasn't changed (which is a good thing!!). All of our favorites are still solidly on the menu, and the Big Ass Burger is still riding tall at the Roaring Fork Happy Hour!  We started with the green chile pork stew and scotch (why yes, they do have one of my favorites...Bunnahabhain...that always puts me in a good mood!). I had the Big Ass Burger... it truly is a big ass burger and really tasty...it's not Kobe beef, it's just beef, but good beef, cooked correctly! Carin had the Roasted Chicken which was also really well prepared...crispy skin, moist and flavorful! We couldn't begin to eat it all, so DeeDee was delighted with us when we got home:) For the capper, they have started making their own pies, in their wood fired oven. You know what's better than chocolate pecan pie in homemade crust (yeah baby, none of the store bought crap for these Roaring Forkers)...almost nothing! Sex, that's about it. Jeez, I waddled out of there, $50 lighter, but that's a hell of a meal for $50, (including a couple of single malts, a marti and dessert)! So, how does a fork roar?  It roars for thee my friend, it roars for thee.

The good news is that I've lost 55 lb's. since last June. The bad news is that nothing really fits any more. Going from big fat guy to a big, somewhat less fat guy has its advantages...I'm down to 8 minute miles on my runs; I can beat up on my much younger squash opponents; I can get into poses in Power Yoga that I wouldn't have even dreamt about 6 months ago; The Beautiful Carin thinks I'm acting much younger again; I can make a better turn on the ball when I play golf; it appears that I will live a reasonably healthy active life into my sixties, at least (and given my good northern European ice-age survivor genetics...my grandmother died of meanness at 98 and my dad still works the ranch at 83) and maybe longer barring bad luck! So, I might as well buy some new clothes. At Ease is one of the better men's stores I have found in the valley.  I had my "go to" shops in Portland and SFO, but not so much here, until I found At Ease.  In Portland and during the first 5 years of my time in SFO, I was a broker and my closet reflected it...Armani and Hugo Boss suits, with the occasional handmade suit from HK, and all the crap that goes with it (you know you have misplaced your priorities when you count your neckties some morning and discover that you own more than $9,000 worth of "neckwear", at retail, which is essentially money for nothing at all).  When I went into the software business, that all changed. The SFO uniform for tech was khaki trousers and a denim or chambray shirt with your logo on it. I must have 40 logo shirts! When I moved to Phoenix, and started my own companies, I could wear whatever I wanted and that quickly became shorts and flip-flops every day. But now, that doesn't even fit! So...new duds.  At Ease has a nice selection...not every garment from every manufacturer, but a selection from each, including manufacturers that you don't hear about very much. They carry Nat Nast, Tommy Bahama (BTW, Tommy, I'll let you know when I'm ready to "Relax"), Boss, Lauren, Ellis, Raphael, Armani as well as some very nice smaller Italian clothiers (I actually fit the tapered waist stuff again!!!), like Zanella, etc. I even picked up a couple of pairs of new Banfi loafers...soft as a mothers kiss and they smell like strawberries...at least until I wear them for a while:). Finally, At Ease has a bar...that's right, you heard me. What a great idea!!! I had a MacCallan's while I got fitted and looked around...Carin had a marti, while she helped me find the new me in the racks. What a civilized way to shop! That alone is worth at least a star! So I think At Ease is going to be my new "go to" for clothes here in Scottsdale.  BTW, they sell shorts and flip-flops there, too!

Zipp's Sports Grill is exactly what it appears to be...there isn't any nuance and if you are expecting any, you are likely in the wrong place! If you want a pretty good burger, pretty good wings, pretty good salads, pretty good sides (fries, rings, etc.) Zipp's will do nicely.  No, I won't tell you that they have the best anything, but they do a decent job across a pretty broad range of sports bar food...nothing that they make is crappy. Once again, this was a place that I quit patronizing for awhile, until the cigarette smoke and the after-effect smell got wrung out of the building. But, I'm glad to be back. I played Squash for a couple of hours on Saturday morning and I was pretty hungry at lunch, and Zipp's was close by, so... We hadn't been in for several months (so many restaurants, so little time), and was nice to come back. The service was terrific, prompt and friendly. It may depend on who you get as a server, or the time of day (we were there for lunch) but we've always been lucky and well taken care of at Zipp's. I had a Zipp Burger and the Beautiful Carin had a big ol' chopped salad. Both were good and tasty, well prepared (even down to getting Carin's order right...no cheese, 2 different dressings on the side, etc., etc., etc.). After de-toxing with couple of hours of hard exercise, re-toxing at Zipp's was a good way to get my cholesterol levels back up!

I hadn't been to Frank & Lupe's for more than a year when I met a potential client there for lunch today. I don't embarrass easily...just look at the fact that I post my actual picture on my Yelp profile. I come from stout Norwegian stock (you want to talk about an internal compass that is seldom right but never uncertain and always unconcerned, it's the good Norwegian wood - gratuitous Beatles reference - that I spring from). But, jeez, I was embarrassed today! I remember this place as being better than this! Do I have early onset "old-timers" disease? Is my fondness for happy hours just the beginnings of a craving for "early bird specials"? I don't know. I got there a few minutes early and was seated and got chips and salsa (both the regular and the hot..I like the hot, but you never know about other peoples taste). So far so good...decent chips and decent salsa, although I seem to remember the chips being warm the last time I was here. It went downhill from there. My lunch meeting arrived and we chatted as we waited for our server to come and take her drink order...and waited...and waited. He finally looked at us (could it have been my frantic waving?), and dropped by the table to find out what all the fuss was about. Took her drink order and asked what we wanted  for lunch. We hadn't decided and that earned us a sniff and spin, and off he went. Another server brought her drink and we looked at the menu's while we talked business and waited for our server to return...and waited...and waited. I just want to iterate that it just wasn't that busy today...maybe 12-15 total tables, in and out, with 3 servers, so not a heavy load. Our server finally returned after another stint of waving (I had my workout this morning, but I got in a little extra upper body at F&L).  He took our orders and we waited...and waited. My fish taco's came out, and we waited for my lunch companions Holy Mole'...and waited...and waited. 5 minutes and I motioned to him (less waving this time...he was looking anxiously between us and the kitchen by now). I asked him to take my order back to the kitchen and keep it warm until both orders could be brought out together...he didn't. Instead he said the mole was coming right out, which it did (if by "right out" he meant 4 minutes from now). This might have all been OK, if the food had been what I thought I remembered...it wasn't...it was worse...way worse. The fish in the taco's was not fresh...little tiny chunks of fish that clearly came out of a can. I tried all three tacos, and there was some variation in the flavors, but not from the fish. The mole may have been worse. I don't know, but for someone who was looking forward to the mole to give up after a half dozen bites was not a good sign. You know, it's never a good idea to have a prospective business relationship see you switch into full jerk mode over something as trivial as a crappy lunch (although I was sorely tempted), so I paid the bill, we continued our conversation and I will probably not get to pick the restaurant the next time we dine together.  But it was a successful lunch in the business sense. I try to "vote local" with my dining and entertainment dollars, and I don't expect perfection, but could some of these places at least try? Canned fish in the tacos...really?!?!?! I don't think my memory is faulty...I think it was better, and I know I was looking forward to having lunch there today. Jeez...this was embarrassing!

I really don't require a whole lot from a pizza (or a pizza joint, for that matter).   You don't have to hand build yourself a big old brick oven, grind your own semolina wheat into flour, milk your own cows for the milk for the mozzarella and press your own olives into super duper virgin olive oil, to impress me.  I don't need for to you to have been blessed by Oprah or Jerry or any of their friends.  All I need is a well-made and high quality pie, friendly and comfortable surroundings, a glass or two of a nice cab or syrah and friendly service and smiling faces!  That's really pretty simple (but then, I am a simple man with simple needs...almost humble, really...and noted far and wide for my humility and modesty...I guess I would say "renowned").  But enough about me...let's talk pies!  Grimaldi's has 'em and a ton of people seem to like 'em!  Rightly so...they are terrific!  The Beautiful Carin and I wandered down to Grimaldi's last evening for dinner...split a Caesar, had a pie and couple of glasses of syrah...sat in the back, near the kitchen and watched the chef's hand toss the pies and stoke the oven with coal...All dark wood, red accents and black and white checked table cloths...just the way a pizza joint should be!  Time to share our weeks with each other and decide how we want our weekend to look...a lovely Friday evening ritual...what a great meal and a great way to slide into the weekend!  Tasty pizza dough, savory sauce and any pretty much any combination of cheese/no-cheese and high quality toppings that you could want, all baked to blistery perfection in the non-homemade coal fired brick oven!  For those of us who don't always like to be told what to do...we get to customize our pizza (and the wait staff doesn't look at you like you just pooped in your chair for having the temerity to attempt to have a pizza pie the way you want it, instead of the way the pizza pooh-bah thinks you should have it)...that's right...have it any way you want!  And yes, they get busy at Grimaldi's and you might have to wait from time to time, but the pleasant people who work the front of the house go out of their way to make you feel welcome and wanted!  * They give you pizza shaped pagers to let you know when they are ready for you, rather than telling you that you have to come find them every hour to find out if you are going be able to eat; * There are tons of things to do nearby (within easy walking distance) if there is a bit of a wait, as well as a terrific and reasonably priced full bar to enhance your appetite; * They give you reasonably accurate estimates of the wait time, so you can decide what you would like to do (as opposed to telling you the wait is "2 hours" and then telling you 4 hours later that they have run out of everything and they are done for the night...too bad for you)  In other words, Grimaldi's operates as a good restaurant should, providing an excellent product and wonderful and friendly service at very reasonable price points!  I understand that one's taste in pizza is subjective and "who's best" is the subject of nearly endless and tedious debate...I mean really tedious...I'm not going be the one to broker peace in our time in the never ending Pizza Wars.  For me, Grimaldi's is a slice of contentment, satisfaction and relaxation...I don't care who wins the Pizza Wars, as long as I can get a Friday night pie every week or two at Grimaldi's!

Houston's, but with a less extensive menu...that's what people say about this place.  And they are right...to an extent...so that probably explains why I actually like the place:)  The Beautiful Carin and I wandered over for dinner the other evening (as you can see, I am a little bit behind on writing my little review-like stories:)  We have been a number of times over the years because when you live in Old Town Scottsdale, Bandera is:  * Close * Pretty Decent Food * Close * Pretty Good Martinis * Close  We generally go to Bandera in the summer and fall when the crowds are gone and they seem almost pathetically happy to see us walk through the door:)  I do enjoy the corn bread...like corny, bready candy:)  And the martini's are big and chock full of vitamin V (and priced somewhat less than the marti's at AZ88:)  The food has always been good, the short ribs, the rotisserie chicken, the prime rib...you know, just good, solid, all-american fare:)  Bandera is probably nothing you'd go out of your way for, and certainly nothing that I would queue up for a 90 minute wait for (during the winter months), but worth the stroll over this time of year:)  So, if you're in Old Town and looking for corn bread, braised short ribs and an ice cold vodka marti, stop in and see the folks at Houstera...I mean Bandston's...oh, you know what I mean:

The rap on Starbucks is that they "over-roast" or "incinerate" their beans.  And I think that might be right...sometimes at Starbucks, it seems like I'm drinking something brewed from charcoal briquettes...it doesn't taste good:(  Now, I will tell you that I am really no connoisseur of coffees...I like coffee, you know...a good dark roast, made with freshly roasted beans:)  But the beans don't have to come from a specific plant , grown on the southern side of a special hill in Columbia and then eaten and pooped out by a badger of some sort.  No, I just want a decent cup of coffee at a decent price:)  Why can't Starbucks do that?  I occasionally need to meet someone for business, and Starbucks comes up as meeting place (and I understand that...they are almost annoyingly ubiquitous:)  I have sat at a cafe table on a street corner in San Francisco, having a cup of coffee at a Starbucks...looking at the Starbucks across the street...Lewis Black calls it "the place where space and time folds in on itself"...I say "why build the Hadron Super Collider to open a black hole?"...Starbucks did it a decade ago with a combination of charred coffee beans and vats of money to open a Starbucks for every adult in the United States:)  In and of itself, that's no reason for a 2 star review...Gordon Gecko said it best..."Greed is Good!" and Starbucks exemplifies that credo...they are a generally very successful corporation grown up from the Bay area defectors from Peet's Coffee...I have no problem with success:)  No, my gripe with Starbucks is that they seem to be all about the marketing and not about the product...their coffee is crap:) So is most of the stuff they serve...it's second or third rate, at best.  And just because it's convenient doesn't mean we all need to stop in.  There is better coffee and better tea and better everything around...at much better prices...it's worth looking for another meeting spot:)

Deedee had a really rough day this week...sick as a...well, as a dog!  Poor little pup!  She had an unpleasant reaction to some of the medicine she takes for her arthritis...she and I are both getting up there in years!  Placebo's and scotch don't help as much anymore!  She's fine now...oh, a little stiff and sore, but still going strong!  To make a long story short(er), I had to get the carpet cleaner out of storage (what, you don't have your own carpet cleaner?!?!).  You know, clean up a few of the spots where she got sick...not really worth having the full blown carpet guys in.  But when I went to use it, one of the doo-hickey's in the fremastat had burbled and the plenum gargoon was kaput!  So that had to be fixed...and in spite of my prowess in fixing most things, I didn't have access to the Plurkie's spanner and the Spretzer spindle needed to repair it!  It's a Hoover (boy do I love the word..."Hooooooover"), and a look at the Hoover website (checking for the right part - a left handed torsion nozzle) led me to Park Ridge Vacuum (another word I love..."Vacuuuuuuum").  I took it by PRV and they fixed my Hoover in about 10 minutes, while I waited...and they charged me exactly $5.00 US money!  I could not have asked for better service, better prices, more convenience and nicer people...and to top it off, they had the PGA golf tournament (reg. tm. - "Glory's Last Spurt") on their TV, for my viewing pleasure while I waited!  I would not even consider going anywhere else to get the fremastat on my Hoover re-snorkeled!

"Terroir" is a French term that is used most frequently to describe the characteristics of a group of vineyards in a given region.  In a more literal sense it means "a sense of place"...it's more about a mood and environment... it's almost purely subjective and qualitative of the feeling you get when you are in the right place and everything about that place is as it should be:)  I like that appellation for the sweet little wine bar on Scottsdale Rd:)  If you've never quite felt at home in a wine bar, this might be the place for you to find your "terroir":)  Terroir Wine Pub has "savoir-faire" ...a certain je ne sais quoi...both comfortable and welcoming that feels right to me:)   Terroir is not swank...it's not "Euro", it's eclectic as hell, from the art on the walls to the "open mike" nights  I am not a wine connoisseur (or "oenophile", for those of you counting on me to overtax both my high school French and my vocabulary skills:), but I can always find something that I like to drink at Terroir, along with small plates (fromage, olives and nuts, saumon and bruschetta) and some interesting conversation.  Decent wine selections and decent prices:)  I've also found talent at Terroir!  I had no idea that there are so many talented people around!  The Beautiful Carin and I have been to a couple of Open Mike nights here and we went to special event a few nights ago (showcasing the extremely talented Sarah Jolly...WOW, can this girl sing a song!!:-)  Sarah was terrific! She writes most of her own songs, and sings and plays the guitar...a musical polymath!  Give Terroir a try...be open to the adventure...listen to some of the very talented people sing and play...have a glass or three of a decent pinot and find your own terroir:)

I admit it...I like potato chips:)  Back when there was about 60 pounds more of me to love, you could say I really liked potato chips:)  But still, if you are looking at the classic "nutrition pyramid"...potato chips are stuffed in there at the tippy top, along with perfectly grilled bone-in rib eye's, single malt scotch whiskey and Dungeness crab legs...all good things and good for you, too:)  At the Village Tavern, they have an appetizer called Colorado Potato Chips...freshly fried potato chips...with a bunch of junk on them.  But, if you ask them nicely, they will bring you just a plate of the chips, all fresh and warm and salty, right out of the fryer...without all the rest of the toppings:)  Now that's an accompaniment:)  A grace note, if you will:)  The Beautiful Carin and I stopped by the other evening... we hadn't been there in several months, and Sarah G's review reminded me that I have missed the good old Village Tavern.  They pour a nice drink at the VT and have a " 1/2 price on any and every drink" Happy Hour, so we had a couple of inexpensive KetelOne marti's and decided to have an early dinner:)  I had the Maple Cured Pork Chop and Carin had their Teriyaki Chicken...both were very good!  At VT, they also make a decent prime rib, some very serviceable burgers, a crab cake sandwich that really uses real crab and tastes like a crab cake should (no, it won't transport you to Newport News, but it's good:), and a Chinese Chicken Salad that always seems to draw me in:)  I've had all of these menu items before (and several other items as well) and never had a bad meal:)  In other words...good, solid tavern/road house fare...except for the chips:)  They transcend the genre and make VT a place worth returning to from time to time (not too often...got to watch the cholesterol:)  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service has always been very pleasant and friendly:)  I never feel that the staff is trying to "optimize" me or turn the table quickly.  And finally, in a rare "double", I need to give a five star shout out to the Village Clubs...by showing my membership card for the Village Clubs at VT, I get a 15% discount on the entire bill:)  I know...it's a chain and I do like to buy local, but come on...Village Tavern has those potato chips...Fresh, Warm, Perfect Potato Chips!  Potato Chips...Just when I thought I was out...they pulled me back in:)

One of my business partners came to town and suggested that we get a steak for dinner.  He went ahead and made a ressie for Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and since he was buying, he got to choose.  We walked in on time for our 7:00 pm reservation to be told that they weren't ready for us yet...in a half empty restaurant.  I was puzzled, but it seemed to be a ploy, more than anything else, to get us into the bar for a cocktail, before we went into the restaurant for...a cocktail. The service was, in a single well chosen word...perfunctory.  Our waiter went through the motions and didn't seem particularly pleased with Ruthies or with us. None of the staff seemed up and happy. Nobody was really smiling or friendly, and every phrase, every question, every move seemed designed to "optimize" us. Every word sounded like it came out of the corporate server manual. The food was OK. If you put enough butter on anything, you can make it taste pretty good, and they put some  butter on them there steaks, let me tell you!  The wine list is fine...I don't have the palate for fine pinot's that my partner does, but he found something from Oregon that he liked and you can't really screw up MacCallan's, neat:) After the initial enforced 20 minute wait for nothing, we were assembly lined through dinner in an hour. How very efficient! :) If it seems that I am being tough on Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, it's only because I am.  You know, when I spend (OK, I didn't spend a dime, dinner was on my partner and believe me when I tell you I deserved to be treated to a free dinner) $250 for 2 people, I want to see the love from everybody in the place, from the minute I walk in the door, through bringing the ice water and the MacCallan's, to perfection in the art of appetizer's, entrée's, desserts and coffee.  I see the love in other places (both considerably more expensive and significantly less expensive, so it's not a case of me just being crabby about pricey dinner spots:), and it just doesn't come shining through here. I just don't get that anybody really gives a crap at Ruthies'. I'm probably wrong, and everybody cares about us, "the valued customer", like the very dickens.  As far as Ruthie's being a chain, so we should expect the corporate approach, well...I see chains where the service is caring and enthusiastic, even if they are serving double-doubles and a coke for $5.45, not steak and scotch for $100+ per, and the fresh faces smiling at me aren't making a $50 tip on my dinner, either. So I know it can be done...and should be done:) BTW, clear up the confusion for me...I know who "Ruth" is, but who or what is her "Chris"?

A little golf today, that's what I needed and that's what I did! Sanctuary has been a favorite of mine for the past few years for several reasons: -It's good test of your golf game...if you aren't swinging the club well, you will find yourself arguing with Mr.& Mrs. RattleS over the possession of your golf ball. You need to be able to hit it a long way and with some accuracy if you play from the tips, but the course opens up to give a comparable but relatively easier test from the forward tees, so a good test for most levels of the game, and; -The course is always in good shape and the greens are usually in really good shape, and; -For the high quality of the course, it's really pretty inexpensive to play. They always seem to have online specials and coupons. That's a great plus when I can't get a buddy to get on at Silverleaf or Whisper Rock or something, and; -Sanctuary has a pretty good practice facility. I always enjoy myself when I go out there because it's not just a driving range. They have short game practice area that gives you the opportunity to create interesting and unusual shots (including a bunker area that allows a bunch of different lies and shots...lots of fun!), and: -Finally, they actually have a pretty decent little cafe. The staff is always pleasant, the food is tasty and better than the usual hot dog or greasy burger that you find a lot of places (although not up to Silverleaf, etc. That would be too much to expect). Go play Sanctuary and take your "A" game.

The very best thing about Papago Brewing Company is...their muffuletta sandwich which is worth the stop all by itself.  You thought I was going to say the thousands of different beers (estimate only...they have 500 taps lining the walls and plate rails, and a cooler the size of semi trailer filled with different kinds of beer...including some that I can only guess at...cherry red beer...really?...people seemed to like it:) The muffuletta sandwich originated at the beginning of the 20th century at Central Grocery, in Nawlin's and has been described as "one of the great sandwiches of the world"...I would be the very last person to disagree with that:) I have been known to get off the plane in the Big Easy and go directly to Central Grocery to get one of these bad boys. The Beautiful Carin and I headed to PBC the other day for lunch...I did think about having a beer, but the selection is almost overwhelming!  If I had been in the mood, they are nice enough to let you sample a few different varieties, so you can kind of figure out what you might enjoy.  But, I was not in a "beer" mood and the single malt scotch selection at PBC leaves something to be desired. But, boy that muffuletta sandwich...good stuff!  The key to a good muffuletta is the olive salad, and they make (or buy...I have no idea, I just know that it's good) a nice olive salad here:) In addition to the olives, carrots, celery, etc., they have added a little extra zip to the salad with, apparently, pepperoncini's! Genius!! The whole thing is assembled on a round Italian roll (interestingly enough, called a muffuletta:) and toasted so the provolone melts a little...delightful! We liked the atmosphere at PBC...lots of wood beams and paneling...it looks like the basement rec room/bar of a friend of my dad's...circa 1962:) The service was pretty decent...reasonably prompt and certainly friendly and pleasant, and Carin liked her club sandwich, too! I think we'll go back and give the beers a try one of these first days (maybe even the cherry red foamy thing:)...but man, it'll have to come with a muffuletta sandwich!

I could have had gelato.  The G-Spot is also on the way home. I could have had a lot of other things but I was just too lazy to get out of the car. The Beautiful Carin and I were on our way home last night.  We attended the terrific Yelp event at La Bocca. I grabbed a biscotto (singular for biscotti) on the way out (delightful...crispy and chocolaty with sweet anise finish) and I really should have been satisfied with that, but Noooooooo! I had to have something else. That turned out to be DQ on Scottsdale Road.  If you happen to be going north on Scottsdale Road, you can't successfully "drive through" this DQ unless you successfully "jump the median curb" and "avoid a head on collision"...all possible with all wheel drive, so I was good to go on that front, however, I arrived at the speaker to place my order in a slightly less relaxed state than I had anticipated. So I was less inclined to be forgiving when I ordered a waffle cone and heard my confirmation come back as "&&^&*^~%^^%%$@~%&@%*~^(&(@&(~@^~*^@^@^~*@^". It could have been that they were saying "yes sir, we will have that cone ready for you at the window", but we'll never know. Got my cone ($2.50), and it was already drippy...I know, I know, it's soft serve (that's what she said:), but still, I expect it to maintain a somewhat frosty and cohesive state, and wait until I get out of the drive through before it falls on  my lap. But, I suppose it tasted OK (the part I got to eat instead of wear). So, dripping cone in hand, we now get to try to successfully leave the drive through at DQ and return to our northbound heading...good luck! We were again fortunate that we have all wheel drive, because the driveway is steep enough to be labeled "curb" in most jurisdictions.  We bounced out into traffic and now needed to make it across 3 lanes of southbound traffic, make a u-turn across the median and negotiate the northbound traffic flow...with one hand! I was saved by 2 things: I spent part of my youth rodeo-ing (bareback bronc's) and I spent a considerably longer time racing (sports and formula cars). So, even with reflexes and visual acuity dulled by age, I was able to safely negotiate all of the hazards encountered trying to "drive through" DQ. I could have had a cookie. The ice cream stains came right out:)

There's nothing like a good hardware store to a guy like me (born and raised on the cattle ranch long before the era of Lowes and Home Depot). Maybe they don't have everything, but they have reasonable facsimile of everything. And if they don't have the thing you need, they have a guy who can help you find it...sort of the hardware internet equivalent, before the  real interwebs was created by Al Gore. Paul's Ace Hardware is a pretty good old line hardware store and it's just about perfect for what I need, now that I am no longer landed gentry and live in the high rise world (OK, it's Old Town Scottsdale...at best we can aspire to "mid-rise"). I call the building if it's something building and big, My Handyman if it's something inside and not so big, and very occasionally, I remember the part of my persona that has built a couple of houses, several barns, rebuilt more cars than I care to think about and pretty much any appliance or machine you can name, and I climb on my bike (it's little too far to walk), and go to Paul's to get what I need to fix something. I save myself time, money and I guess I still get a little satisfaction out of fixing something (I swore I wouldn't do that anymore when we moved back to town, but I guess you really can't get the friggin' country out of the boy). Paul's Ace Hardware, it's the Ace Hardware chain, but with a local owner. They probably have what you need.

I had a lunch meeting today and we decided to deli, but the question was Italian or kosher deli? I hadn't been to De Falco's for over a year, so it seemed to be a good day to revisit and have a sandwich on the patio. I was a fan before and I am a fan now. I had the Italian beef with peppers and onions, and my only comment is that I wish they would dunk the entire sandwich in au jus (I think it's OK to get messy to have a good time...in fact it may be required).  That's not really a complaint, mind you, just a comment. De Falco's gives you plenty of love in the form of a nice big sandwich with great ingredients, great fresh bread choices (crunchy italian roll is the best for sandwich like this). My lunch companion had the chicken parm (he had never been to De Falco's, or really an italian deli of any sort) and he was really pleased with his selection as well (in fact as we were leaving he saw one of the pizza's and said he was going to give them try for pizza this weekend, so he really was impressed). The only other italian deli/sandwich shop in Phoenix that I've tried is Luke's of Chicago (I know, not really the same, but some of the sandwiches are similar and italian beef is italian beef, so...). I think De Falco's is substantially better, and their broad selection of sandwiches, meals and other take out really gives them a leg up. Service is courteous, prompt and everything shows up at the table hot and on time.  Great place for lunch, and take out italian!

I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...I'm thinking his fully tumescent "manhood" must be the size and color of a 7 year old raisin...I can't imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high powered/laser sighted rifle from 500 yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.  There was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon..."Asshole".  He did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy..."vote with your feet"...but I guess that's another review.  The Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!  At the very tippy top of the "near and dear" list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.  Whit is a Vegan...with a capital "Vege"...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.  So she was thrilled that her meat lovin' daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!  I am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare rib-eye...I don't think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!  I checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!  We ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynami's and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!  Even after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!  The big question about Green is "why didn't I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?"  I don't know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye t-shirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.  I like to "fit in".  The menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aroma's (always a big deal for me) are both exotic and welcoming.  I didn't have to break out the bacon (although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary).  I really could eat this way on a regular basis...it's that good...I probably won't, but it's nice to know I could!  I imagine that Karma will have it's own way of dealing with a self-justifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!

Do you like it when you sit at the counter in a diner and the waitress calls you "Hon"..."Sweetie"..."Darlin' "?   I know...I do too! It makes me feel like I've stepped back in time, to some mis-remembered past that probably never really happened to me (I may have watched too much TV many years ago...in fact when I walk into Jim's Coney Island, it seems to be in black and white, to me:)   After my workout today, I was looking for a good place to retox:)   I hadn't been to Jim's in quite a while, and this seemed to be a good time to get back to the lunch counter at Jim's:)   Jim's throws the love at you...in any other hands this stuff is just regular diner fare...you know, the blue plate specials...the patty melts...the ham and cheese sandwiches...the clam chowder from the big white one gallon can...the frozen chicken fried steaks...you know, just good, solid diner food:)   But, when they call me "cutie" as they serve my coney island and fries, it just makes everything...better:)   What can I tell you...I'm a sucker for flattery:)   That's not to say that Jim's serves crappy food and makes up for it with flattery...in fact it's all very tasty (including the actual coney island hot dog...not chili dog...coney island hot dog:)...but it's not really special food.   So, what is special about Jim's? It's the atmosphere, ambiance, the nice people, the varied and eclectic menu and specials (Liver & Onions, Greek Feta Salad and Bacon/Avocado Omelet, all juxtaposed on the specials menu today, along with the normal 100+ items on the regular menu:)   About the only thing I would add to Jim's, would be homemade pie...a lunch counter like this needs 4-5 great pies, so I would have a place to go and have a cup of coffee and a piece of banana cream pie...but that's a quibble, not a criticism:)   Jim's takes me back to the days when I could sit down at the counter for lunch, next to Hugh Beaumont, and get an open faced roast beef sandwich for lunch, served by a wise-crackin' waitress that always calls me "good lookin":)   Even if it never happened, that's how I remember it, Hon:)

Golf in the kingdom...the kingdom of Las Vegas. Bali Hai is a nice place to play golf when you are in Las Vegas. It's a really pretty little course (more like an island course in Hawaii or the Caribbean than a high desert course, although surrounded by city). Shot selection and accuracy is important, esp. if you play from the tips. One really nice feature of Bali Hai is the caddies (are the caddies?). How delightfully civilized! The Bali Hai is nice oasis in the heart of the beast.

I've read that brevity is the soul of wit...  Brevity is also a wonderful thing when it comes to the waiting time for your dinner of Italian peasant food...pizza:)  Brevity is not Pizzeria Bianco's strong suit...(nor mine, in writing reviews, but we're not talking about me:)  After my second visit in 4 years (and 4th visit overall), I'm trying to figure out what PB's strong suit is:(...public relations and marketing, perhaps?  Creating the "Pizza Placebo Effect"?  I generally try not to knowingly go anyplace that aggravates me, whether it's for dining, for drinking, for entertainment, for using the restroom...really for pretty much anything:)  So why were we back at PB after a good solid 4 year run of avoiding this particular aggravation?     Other people, that's why:)  Other people wanted to go to PB...other people wanted to try the Wiseguy and the Marghareta and see Chris's oven and have mozzarella cheese and what not... and so the Beautiful Carin (who has the patience of a saint) and I took them out to PB the other evening...well, it was evening when  we started:(  We went...we waited...we had some pizza...and it was pretty average artisan pizza...  Was it the worst pizza I've ever eaten?...oh no...'sup, Totino's?  Was it the best pizza that I can remember eating?...oh no...How you doin' Flying Pie in Portland and Di Fara in Brooklyn?  Is PB worth the aggravation?...Sadly, not for me:(  For me, it's hard to overlook the attitude at the door, and the "you're barely worthy of eating here" attitudes of the servers (both in Bar Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco), as I try to enjoy my evening.  I understand that all the kids "assisting Chris" at PB think they're pretty special to be working at PB and all...but...it's a pizza joint...would it hurt them to at least try to be personable and pleasant?  It's also hard for me to overlook the multi-hour wait to dine at PB (and, truth be told, we've been here before...we did come expecting a wait...we were prepared to have wine and relax...I even had my flask, so I had a scotch and tried to relax)...still 3  1/2 hours...for pizza?  I can fly  1/2 way to NYC in the time it takes to get a table (and the flight attendants on Continental are sweet and pleasant to me...feed me drinks in 1st class...you know...they make me feel appreciated:)  And speaking of "appreciated"...it's hard for me to overlook the lack of appreciation we've encountered at PB:(  The few times we've been to PB, the staff hasn't seemed to be in a pleasant mood...very quick to tell us "the rules of PB" and eager to let us know that if we weren't good little customers, there were 50 more people in line that would happy to take our places:(  You know what... they are right...there were 50 more people that would have loved to see us leave and they would have moved up in the queue.  But it's obnoxious of the folks at PB to make that the overriding theme of the evening and it belies any pretense that they might try to concoct about "customer service" and being the "the best possible pizza experience for each customer"...the attitude of "we're PB and you're not" is pervasive and unpleasant:(  And frankly, when I spend well over $200 for pizza, wine and cheese for 4 in the course of a 3+hour wait, get a rush job on the very late dinner and a lamentable lack of service from the waiter (who's busy chatting with friends or "regulars" at the counter)...well, it causes me aggravation.  But the good news is that I won't be back for another 4 years...less aggravation for me and more spaces in the line at the door:)

I am not a "pretty man"...no I'm really not...stop it...you're making me blush! :-)  Really, even though The Beautiful Carin tells me that I'm "adorable", I am really more of a "regular joe"...a (youngish) middle aged "everyman".  I am reminded of this fact each and every time I stroll in to AZ 88:)  There are, indeed, tons of pretty people at AZ 88...lounging, laughing, lingering, loitering, lolling, loving and probably even lusting:)  For 20 years (although I've only been here for about 5 of those years) AZ 88 has been one of the "see and be seen" places in Scottsdale.  And it shows in the clientele...but they let me in anyway:)  It's been a good spot for the Beautiful Carin and I to grab a pre-function cocktail, a relatively cheap burger or sandwich (and a giant martini) or a post-function nightcap.  Besides the fact the fact that it's right in my neighborhood, there are several reasons that Carin and I have become fond of this place over the years:)  * The food really is pretty good...the burgers, sandwiches, salads and appetizers are generously sized and the waffle fries hit the sweet spot in the crusty/greasy axis of arterial obstruction (I was going to attach the graph I created but Yelp doesn't play that way:)  * The food really is pretty inexpensive...I was going to say cheap, but really...it's not cheap, cheap...just inexpensive compared to some of the other places around the neighborhood :)  * The drinks are better than pretty good:) I was thinking that they are expensive, but then I looked at the size of these things and the price to buzz ratio becomes a terrific value (again, I was going to attach a very compelling chart that I've created, but no attachment feature for  spreadsheets and charts! :-)  * The atmosphere is relaxed and relaxing, but fun and upbeat...does that make sense? It does to me after a couple of AZ 88 Ketel One martini's:) Two of those big ass marti's are like a six pack of marti's from Dick's Hideaway...for a lot less dough:) I'm glad I can walk here and back home:)  * There is always something "happening" at AZ 88...at Christmas, the martini glass Christmas Tree...witticisms' painted on the walls, power couples attempting to couple in the unisex loo, music and laughter...what more could you want?:)  * Which brings me to the final bullet point of my AZ 88 presentation...the people watching...AZ 88 is like the headwaters of the mighty Columbia River...except that here we have Scottsdale's beautiful people and there we have Chinook salmon...but, respectively, these places are where they go to spawn:) AZ 88 might not be such a blatant meet up spot as someplace like Cream, Dirty Pretty or the W, but for easy conversation, strong drinks and reasonable food, AZ 88 still pretty much leads the pack (again, I put together a trending bar chart that clearly illustrates my point, but I couldn't attach it...oh well if you want the charts and spreadsheets, let me know and I can email them to you:)  Pick a nice evening, wander through the park and end up on the deck at AZ 88...that's what we do every couple of months.  Enjoy watching people strolling through the park, the cocktails, a chicken sandwich and waffle fries and watch all the mating rituals going on around you...some people might call this decadent and dissolute, but I call it "Thursday Evening":)

You know, Cirque du Soleil is great brand and the shows they do are first rate.  The concierge at the Trump was able to get us great seats for either Zumanity or O and we decided to go to Zumanity (hey, we were in Vegas, we needed to be little bit naughty!). And, great seats they were...second row with our eyes right at stage level, and close enough to touch everything on the stage (although you wouldn't necessarily want to). Boys and girls;girls and boys; girls and girls; boys and boys; old and young and pretty much every combination of the above that you would think possible.  The show is very funny in spots, certainly beautiful all the way through. The acts themselves are everything you would expect from CdS, funny, magical, awesome in many respects. There is so much athletic talent on the stage, that the stories they are trying tell get a little lost in the acrobatics and sometimes things feel a bit  disjointed (much like the contortionist in his underwear...creepy but strangely funny). The price you pay for great seats at this show is that the performers feel duty bound to interact with you. The Beautiful Carin and I found ourselves dragged into the proceedings 2-3 times (we just wanted to see the show...is that so wrong?!?!?). Anyway, beautiful, athletic, entertaining people...most of them naked or nearly so for the entire show...in an entertaining show with a little something for everyone.

I just noticed today that Amy D. and I had exactly the same number of reviews...224!   Amy's 224th review was of the Arizona Canal and in her honor, my 225th review is of...The Arizona Canal:)  When I complemented her on her terrific review of this engineering marvel, I mentioned that I thought of her that very morning, because I was out running on the canal and saw a dead body...GASP!!!!  Well, it was the dead body of a canal carp or whatever aquatic creature lives in the canals...still, it was a body and it was clearly quite dead!  When I see the fish in the canal (and the fisher-people angling for them), I am reminded not so much of fly fishing on the Metolius or Deschutes in Oregon...I think more along the lines of Springfield Lake on the Simpsons...I expect to see an angler pull up a carp with 3 eyes and a foot for a flipper.  I have been using the canals for running and biking and strolling (but not fishing) since I arrived in this dusty little cow town back in `03...and using them very successfully, I might add:)  From the near reaches of the Biltmore (next to my first home in the valley), to Paradise Valley and North Scottsdale, and now in the 85251...I've always had a version of the waterway nearby, to use as a recreational playground...I think they (whoever "they" are) must have planned it that way:)  The levee's holding the water in are broad and flat, graded pea gravel in most spots...paved in some others...perfect for a jog (easier on my old knees and ankles) or bike ride!  The canals seem to go pretty much everywhere around the valley (I've ridden from NoSco to Tempe and CenPho and from the 85251 to pretty much everywhere and back on the canals) and they are all easy to access from just about any street that comes within 200 yards of a branch.  That's also led some folks to take to the canals for nefarious purposes (hence the constant vigilance for dead bodies, as well as keeping an eye out for the "Canal Decapitators":)  I don't know that a gang like that exists, but I do know that a couple of decades back, they found headless body or 2 near the canals...none of us want to end up like that...I mean how could we wear a cool fedora if we didn't have a head?  But I don't worry about that too much...I'm 6'2" and my running buddy is 6'3" and a former major league catcher...people pretty much just seem to give us a polite "Howdeedoo" when we meet (I say "meet" because we don't "pass" too many people...the occasional arthritic octogenarian or nonagenarian, but that's about it:)  The canals really are a multi-use marvel...they bring water and life to the desert, they are an attractive place to run and bike and play, they raise real estate values in the 85251 by letting themselves be called "waterfront" and they provide a focus for light hearted banter about dead people and gruesome crimes:)  That's about as much as you can ask for from public infrastructure waterworks!

As I was sitting on a rock at the top of Camelback this morning, I was thinking two things (OK, maybe more than two things, but mostly two things:)      1- I wonder what I should write about this little sojourn for Yelp? :-)      2- I wonder what would be good for breakfast? :-)  And they say men are complicated...no, we are not complicated at all:)  We are indeed delicate hot-house flowers (like orchids or something:) that must nurtured and cared for by the feminine half of the population:)  We men have our little needs that must be met, or like the children that we are (in the greater sense of us all being children of the universe:)...we can grow petulant and cranky that we aren't getting our way (once again, needing to be saved from ourselves by the distaff side of the population:)  Just ask us...we'll tell you exactly what we are thinking...and while it may not make any sense whatsoever, it will, in fact, be what we are thinking...go ahead, ask...I'll wait:-)  At any rate, I was sitting on the rock and thinking about what to write about Camelback Mountain for Yelp...  I could write:      - It's gem (although not a hidden gem...you can see this sucker clearly from an altitude of 130 miles on Google Earth...you can't hide a mountain in the middle of a city:)      - It's a terrific walk:)...I really do enjoy my strolls up this little hump:) It's not like climbing back in Oregon or California (Mt. Hood, Mt. Rainier, and Mount Shasta all have snow on them, pretty much all the time...they are frikkin' freezing, pretty much all the time and they all take 2 days to climb, pretty much all the time...none of that here:)...Warm and sunny, a little breeze at the top...2 hours total, including some meditation time at the top:)      - You meet a bunch of nice people and you can chitchat on the trail...and isn't that a great part of any park experience?...I think so, too:)   It occurred to me that maybe I write too much on Yelp, while I was sitting up there, contemplating my navel...but that can't be the case...I'm barely 85,000 words into my Yelping:)  And last, but certainly not least, I found the answer to at least one of the questions I was asking myself up on Camelback...retox breakfast at Lolo's after I got down:-]  This is, indeed, living the dream:)

I went to Fez for Foodies a couple of weeks ago (or did I go to a "Fez for Foodies UYE" at Fez...I wasn't clear on how I should specify my attendance...one or the other...you pick:) I met up with (and met some for the first time) a whole fubar (Jim W...thanks for the sobriquet...so very apt in its description of us:) of Yelper's, gathered at Fez and happily tucking in to a new dish created by Fez. I didn't realize that Fez for Foodies was not just a Yelp event...it was also an event at which you can try a new item that Fez is thinking about adding to the menu, write a comment on it, discuss it with the fine folks who run Fez, discuss it with your fellow diners, take pictures of it, rub it all over yourself (the last is optional..strictly optional, despite what Thomas may tell you...I'm not falling for that twice Thomas:), or whatever else you need to do in order to provide Fez with real feedback so that they can make an informed menu decision:) I understand that Fez does this pretty frequently!  What a great idea! Fez gets to try out dishes that they are thinking of putting on the menu...without actually having to pungle up for reprinting menus, re-pricing items, reordering for the kitchen, etc.! If the new item gets good feedback, I assume it goes on the menu at the right time...if the dish is a clunker, Fez gets a chance to either fix it based on comments or give it the AMF treatment, without having sullied their menu:)  I walked in and I was greeted warmly by Thomas, fellow Yelper and the genial and hilarious GM of Fez. It was great to see my Yelp pals and meet some new ones, but I really think we need something more than just "hi" when we greet each other...we need a lodge greeting of sorts..."yelp, yelp" seems obvious...maybe too obvious...we can work on it:) The décor and atmosphere at Fez is downtown sophisticate...the colors and lines made me recall a swank little a bistro in Prague...the whole place has a very "euro" feel to it:) Nicely done! There must have been more than 20 of us yelpers but the service could not have been better...I wish I could remember our servers name...I would single him out for lavish praise, but I can't and now we'll never know, nor will he...too bad:) Oh well...our server told me about the Fez Foodies thingy and that they were serving some sort of steak, so I said "I'll have a Fez burger, please". I had heard and read about the legendary Fez Burger...now I wanted one for my very own! I got my Fez burger with fries (regular fries...I'm just not generally a huge fan of sweet potatoes, except in pie:)...good fries and plenty of 'em! But Oh Baby...that is a good burger! It may not be for everybody (the burger has pear slices, cilantro, lemon garlic aioli, feta cheese and onion rings among other things), but it sure worked for me:) As much as I sometimes like just a good old plain burger, when you go for the gusto (burgerwise) you want gusto explosions!  Fez delivers on the promise of a fully gusto'd hamburger with the Fez burger! And it's huge...too much for me at dinner, but possibly even better the next day:) BTW, I don't know who thought up putting pears on a burger (hey, could it have been a result of the Fez Foodies thing?)...but WOW...good idea! The flavors and the seasoning are so complimentary and the burger is so very well constructed (ciabatta bun...needed because this a juicy little sucker:) that this burger is moving into my Top Five Burgers in the USA! (I won't tell you who I had to kick out...oh alright...it's Taylors Refresher in St. Helena...I understand that they've gotten a little too big for their britches). I can't speak to the Fez Foodies dining experiment (people seemed happy) nor, really, any of the other menu items...(I'm sure they are delightful). I'm sure I will try some of the other items one day...when I tire of the Fez burger...oh who am I kidding..I just found a great burger...I'm not gonna screw around with anything else!

I met friend for lunch at FEZ today...And as always, I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I hadn't caught up with Mark (my Philosophy Cafe buddy) in several months (he didn't even know that I am headed for the beach!) and it was great to see him and chit-chat for a while.  They were smokin' busy at lunch today...Thomas was just a blue shirted blur as he sped through the place making sure each table was getting what they needed and that FEZ was running smoothly!  Indeed it was!  I was going to have my favorite...the incomparable FEZ burger!  But the plan for today was to head to Zinburger for a little celebration dinner tonight (it got a little derailed, we ended up "feasting" at home), so I went with my alternate favorite...the Tan Tan Chicken sandwich!  So very good with bacon and fries and so very bad for me (I was fortunate to have just biked for 30 miles this morning, so I needed the additional toxins).  It reminds me a little of a muffaletta, but so much better.  Mark and I chatted and caught up while we enjoyed FEZ's impeccable service and great sandwiches.  I'd tell you I'm going to miss this place when I head to the coast, but it will be in my regular rotation whenever I'm back in the Valley of the Sun.  I also offered Thomas the queen size bed in the guest room (he was so nice, said he'd be happy on a futon, but that's not how I roll), so I figure I'll be able to get a table at FEZ when I'm in town!

Bellagio or Wynn...that is the question. We decided to go to the Wynn Buffet (we were staying at the Trump, across the road). I think the trick is to a little bit off peak, for a couple of reasons: 1. - The wait is not very long if you are not there at 7 or 8 in the evening...we hit the buffet at about 6:15 and waited less than 10 minutes, and; 2. - I think everything is less picked over and fresher when it's a little less crowded. OK, it's a buffet, but a really terrific buffet, with cocktails and the whole deal! The selection is awe inspiring, from the fish to the steaks to the pasta and salads to the dessert, cheeses and everything in between. Really magnificent and the chefs do a great job of preparing everything well and keeping new dishes coming out hot (or cold if required) and on time. I know, for $75-80 for a buffet, it should be terrific...it is. I only wish I could eat more.

The Beautiful Carin and I stayed at the Valley Ho to celebrate my birthday this week! I turned 40 for the first time (after many years of celebrating my 39th birthday, it's time to move on and "grow up":) Café ZuZu is the in house restaurant at Valley Ho and a genuine bright spot in an already terrific hotel experience.  ZuZu is named after the little girl in "It's A Wonderful Life", the movie that's on TV 2-3 dozen times each Christmas.  What that has to do with the restaurant is unclear, but they had to name it something, and ZuZu works for me:) I think we all know that hotel restaurants can be an "uneven" experience, but that's not the case with little ZuZu:) We have eaten at ZuZu's before, over the years and always found the food and service to be very good and very reasonably priced (esp. for a hotel restaurant, where the prices and service often reflect the fact that they think you are captive to their $15 tuna sandwiches and their $20 omelets). ZuZu's is reasonably priced and they serve a great meal! This visit, I had a BLT with an over easy egg on it...I didn't really think you could improve on a decent BLT...I stand corrected! This sandwich has a touch of genius! I also tried their truffled grilled cheese and club sandwiches...wonderfully made...fresh tasting ingredients and great bread, well prepared eaten poolside with a couple of martini's...now that's what I call a hearty breakfast:) Fresh cut fries and fresh house made potato chips are a great accompaniment to the meals. The menus are creative and I have yet to have an unhappy experience at ZuZu. Whether you sit inside at ZuZu and listen to Frank, Tony and rest crooning along like it's 1960 again, or have your lunch at the pool and listen to Pearl Jam, Priest and the Boss, ZuZu is a good time:)

Carin and I decided to go out for a bite on Friday evening and we just started walking through downtown Scottsdale, trying to decide. Bada Boom wasn't crowded and we were able to sit right down. The service was prompt and attentive, and it was just right way to settle into a weekend frame of mind. Our server was very sweet and chatty and the owner came by to say "hello" as well. Everything was relaxed and unhurried, although the  food and drink always showed up at exactly the right moment. Carin and I each had a glass of Cab ( I actually thought the house Cab was better than the St. Michelle). We split a Caeser and she had Chicken Parmesan and I had Penne Bolognese, both tasty Italian comfort food. I gave this 4 stars, since I have had better Italian food. But, the ambiance of the patio out front, the friendly staff and great service combined to make it a very pleasant meal and a very pleasant evening.

We only went there for the cheesecake. I don't know if the recipe didn't travel well from Manhattan or what but I was really disappointed. It just wasn't very good. The crust wasn't up to standard...doughy but tough...how did they do that? The  cheesecake itself was OK. But the worst part...$25 for a couple of slices of cheesecake and beverages. I know I am in Las Vegas, but seriously...whiskey tango foxtrot! It's unfortunate when I can get better cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory than Carnegie Deli. I still stop by when I'm in NYC, but I doubt I'll try this location again, anytime soon.

I'm moved to write a limerick instead of a haiku...this time:)          We stopped at the Jungle at lunchtime,       The Hummus and Schwarma were both fine,       The food is all scrumptious,       The service is bumptious,       All in all, though, we had a good time:)  I just noticed that I wrote an entire limerick without a single reference to Nantucket...a first for me:)  A solid 4 stars:)

It's dark in there!  Honestly, I walked in last Saturday and it was like trying to see where you are going right after you turn out the bathroom light at 2:00 am:)  The last time I was at one of the Burning Embers/Richarsdson's Family of Restaurant offerings (Richardson's, Rokerij and Dick's Hideaway, as I understand it), I told myself I wouldn't be returning...I had listened to the boss (the owner?) screaming at an employee, over some error, for a solid 3-4 minutes as the Beautiful Carin and I tried to eat a nice dinner at Richardson's:(  It was like watching Hell's Kitchen, up close and personal.  And not what I expect in a dinner house, quasi fine dining establishment.  However, I got roped into a post squash tournament group brunch/retox with my buddies from the Village.  They all wanted to go to Dick's, so I was outvoted...I could have gone home, but that would have been impolite and no fun:)  As I stumbled over the threshold trying to adjust my eyes from the arc welder intensity of the Phoenix noon hour, to the eerie dark wood, leather and no light world that is the Hideway, I told myself "well, I didn't darken their door again...the door was already darkened":)  Would I have gone back on my own...even to score a coveted review for Yelp?   I'm going to have to say "No"...Much as I love the spicy food and the New Mexican style of cooking, I was pretty sure that I would rather drive to Santa Fe for New Mexican style food than have dinner disturbed by a Gordon Ramsey wanna be again:(  But you know something...I am not one to hold a grudge or to be "Donnie Downer" so let's start with some positives from the brunch the other day:  * There was no screaming, whatsoever:)  * The service was outstanding...no really, our server was excellent  and friendly, as well as knowledgeable and competent:)  * They know how to make a pretty good vodka martini:)  * They sure know where to find the peppers in the kitchen:)  * The menu is reasonably creative:)  On the other hand (oh, you knew it was coming...two stars...it couldn't be that everything was great)  * The Carne Adovada and Eggs (the "signature" dish, as I understand it) was mediocre...the pork was pretty dry, the potatoes were a bit undercooked and I was frankly glad for the eggs and beans to put a little moisture back in the dish...the flavors were good, though and if the pork hadn't been dry and if the potatoes were done, I could see this dish being a solid choice:)  * $25 for two vodka martini's on a Saturday afternoon...really? I don't like to complain about prices, generally, but this seems to be a stretch...these things were  1/2 the size of the marti's at oh, say AZ88, yet they cost more. That doesn't make me happy:(  I just haven't had the best of luck with places named "Dick's" anything...Dickey's BBQ is just a pit and Dickie's Dog's apparently fed the wrong person a crappy hot dog one too many times and got fire bombs thrown through their front window for their trouble.  The Richardson's Family of Restaurants has already had enough trouble along the fire front, so I certainly wish them the best with their restaurant activities.  But I probably won't be back until the next time one of my buddies wants to drag me here again...or if I miss an episode of Hell's Kitchen and want to catch up:)

What is the happiest time? Why it's the happy time that good restaurants sell good eats at half price!!! Happy Hour! (one of my favorite phrases, right up there with "swim up bar"  and  "caviar bar"). Happy Hour, that's when I go to Wildfish.  Oysters and crab cakes and seared Ahi, oh my! I've tried the other appetizers (the calamari is OK, the salad is a salad, and we sometimes get the iced shellfish tower, which is also pretty good), but these items at 1/2 price and martini's are the main reason reason to go to Wildfish. They generally have a some pretty decent wines at decent prices for Happy Hour, too! The Beautiful Carin and I have had dinner here a few times, when the seafood craving gets to strong for me to resist, and Wildfish is pretty good for Phoenix seafood (I lived in Portland for 40 years and then in SFO for a decade, so I just haven't found anything here in town that measures up to the great seafood places there and in Seattle). The service always seems to be pretty good (it occasionally gets a little bit hectic at happy hour, but not too bad, depending on when you go over there). I really do like the decor and atmosphere at Wildfish, too. The ambiance is really pleasant, and kind of reminds me of the ambiance at Farallon in SFO (I know, no jellyfish lamps, etc., but a bit more understated and subdued lighting and blue tones that offset the wood and metal...just really well done). At any rate, try Wildfish for Happy Hour

While my buddy Mike Z. was in town, we hit a few high spots...by which I could mean that we were high when we hit them...so munchies:)  But, no...my drug of choice is KetelOne or Bunnahabhain these days:)  One of the high spots was the fabulous Scottsdale Waterfront and Olive and Ivy:)  Of all the things that you can say about the Scottsdale Waterfront the most accurate is that it is, indeed, on the water:)  I grew up in the northwest and then lived in San Francisco for many years...I've dined overlooking the Mighty Columbia, the Mighty Pacific, The Mighty Willamette.  While traveling, I've managed to sup while overlooking the Mighty North Sea, the Mighty Atlantic and the Mighty Mississippi.  I'm probably not a good one to ask about the waterfront appeal of the Mighty Arizona Canal:)  Never the less, Olive and Ivy is a nice enough place:)  It's another Fox Concept (don't you just love the branding and labeling of these kinds of things:)  I suppose it would just be too darn simple to just say "Hey, look!...Sam Fox just opened a new place!:)...Yay!"...or something like that...no, it's a "concept"...and if you know me at all (and most of you don't) you know that restaurant nomenclature is nearly a complete mystery to me.  Fox Concept is no exception (oh, I get the "Olive and Ivy"...it's sort of Mediterranean, with a what...California overbite?:)...is that a concept?  I any event, The Beautiful Carin, Mike and I strolled over for cocktails and dinner, stayed for desert, sat out on the patio (which is very pleasant, BTW:)  And we enjoyed ourselves!  Well, why not...it was an enjoyable evening...pleasant atmosphere... the service was very good (I sometimes wonder if my reputation as a stupid good tipper is being spread around town...I seem to get great service even in places that don't really have a reputation for good service...I don't know...maybe it's just a coincidence:)  At any rate...the concept was hoppin'!:-)  Ton's of terrific people watching...people dining, people strolling along the Mighty Arizona Canal, people doing the hook up dance in the bar...dinner and a show...what a concept! :-)  We each had a couple of marti's (oh, the joys of being able to walk to dinner!:)  We started with a hummus something appetizer and antipasti...The Beautiful Carin and I split a perfectly serviceable Caesar salad and I had a nice risotto, while Carin ordered her standby...roasted chicken (I wish I could remember what Mikey ordered, but I was too busy with my marti's, chit chat and what not:)  After dinner, desert seemed like a reasonable idea:)  Mike and I each had a Porto, while we all shared something chocolate and another something kind of cinnamon and orange...  It was all pretty good, not the best risotto, but good...actually, not the best anything, but still good...all pretty well executed (if not truly inspired)  If Fox's Concept is separating me from my money on a fairly regular basis, then I guess it's a successful concept:)

I went to my monthly philosophical gathering last Friday...we examine, ponder and discuss some of the more esoteric aspects of life!  I had so much fun!  It's 2-3 hours of defining, questioning, cussing, discussing, opining, agreeing, disagreeing...well, you get the drift...last week's topic was "What is Art?"  I did not know that people felt as passionately about art and artistic expression as they do...and that includes me:)  Normally, I would try to have a couple of pops before a discussion like this (that's to honor Socrates, Aristotle, Plato and their students...their sessions were often drunken debauches and the last man standing was the "winner" in the philosophical debate of the evening...good times:)  But I didn't ...I was stone cold sober for this discussion...I might have even made sense!   After we finished our discussion, several of us decided that a cocktail was a very good idea and headed to the Vig...I know, you thought it was hip nightspot, but it's really renowned throughout the Valley of the Sun as a philosopher's hangout.  Nice place...all concretey from the outside, all wood and fabric and leathery inside...pretty...even "artistic":)  When we got to the Vig, the scholarly discussions were occurring at full volume all around us:)  * "Gimme a cig" * "DUDE!!!!" * "Don't look...it's Cindy and Darrel" * "Hey Baby...wanna go see my (car, house, dog, condo, wiener, etc.)"  And much, much more...accompanied by enormous clouds of cigarette smoke (another aid to a good philosophical discussion).  We sat and chatted and had a couple of pops...and I would have said that The Vig was A-OK...except for one minor philosophical disagreement...you, Mr. Waitperson, don't get to unilaterally upgrade my order to something far more expensive!  I had no idea who was going to be buying (although it turned out to be me) and I ordered J&B with a cube and a splash (I didn't want to put the hurt on my philosophically minded buddies by ordering the expensive stuff:)...but when the waiter brought my drink, I knew instantly that this wasn't J&B...it was Macallan 12!  And while I do love it so, it was almost 3 times as expensive as the J&B...I asked the waiter why he didn't bring what I ordered and he said...and I quote..."quote"..."The bartender is a scotch guy and said this is better"...end quote.  No sh*t!  I quietly said "I didn't order the Macallan...are you saying this is going to be the same price as the J&B?  Oh no...it wasn't:(  But as my waitperson said..."It's already poured...what do you want me to do about it?"  I could have made a scene, caused a problem, left a $0.10 tip...but I didn't...this was philosophy night...I was in a philosophical mood!  And my philosophy is this...I have a giant problem with any establishment that pulls this kind of crap...it may only be an isolated incident, but it could also be systemic....how many drunks check their tabs?  I know, you're saying "well, Donald, it's only the difference between $5.50 and $14.00 for that drink", and you would be right...I spill more than that most days:)  But I get to decide what I spill it on...not the bartender and waitperson at The Vig.   At best it's corrupt and at worst, it's, well...worse than corrupt.

The Beautiful Carin and I are collaborating on a writing project.  The project is titled "Spanxx, the Unenthusiastic Stripper"...it will be beautifully illustrated, in delightful and fanciful watercolor's, designed to inspire the imagination:)  It's a children's book:)  The first of series, really, about "Spanxx", a delightful "seasoned citizen" and her misadventures trying to make a living in this economy:)  We took a collaborative meeting at The Vig last Saturday.  I know what you are going to say, after reading my earlier review, you are going to ask, "Why would you go back to the Vig, Donald?"  I would ask the same question...the answer,  is that one of the owners of The Vig sent me a note, apologized for the problem, assured me that what I experienced was not their policy, and asked me to give them another try...and he was so darned nice about it (and really, he was even nice about my review, which wasn't especially nice), that I couldn't say "no".  I took Carin (who had no firsthand knowledge of either The Vig, or my review, although she had heard that the place was very cool from some of her modeling and acting buddies).  We hit The Vig at what is likely the very best time to visit...early Saturday afternoon and got ourselves situated in one of the outdoor booths...a warm breeze was blowing and the martini's were flowing:)  It's a different atmosphere altogether on a weekend afternoon...no cigarettes, no raging hormones (or at least if they are raging, they are doing so quietly...much like "Spanxx":)  We ordered a hummus and baba ganoush appetizer, a Vig Cobb salad and the Pork Torta, as well as the aforementioned marti's and we spent a couple of hours having lunch and cocktails, discussing our project and laughing and discussing and laughing some more!  And it was really nice...I mean really very nice.  I asked Carin what she thought about The Vig, and she said "this is wonderful...it should be our "go to" in Arcadia"!  So I showed her what I had written, and she said, as all supportive spouses should "You must have misunderstood"...meaning me...meaning that I was likely, even probably, wrong:(  Well, I suppose I could have misunderstood...I may have misjudged...I am very busy solving very complex problems in my mind on a pretty much constant basis...and I had just been to my philosophy discussion night, so I was thinking about all that stuff...probably:)  Oh what the hell...I was charmed by the afternoon version of The Vig, and since Carin likes it, I know that we will be frequent visitors.   I'm OK with that...the food was good, the service was good, the atmosphere on a warm spring afternoon was delightful and it was splendid little spot to let the dishes and the glasses pile up.  It takes a big person to admit they made a mistake...and humility prevents me from pointing out that I am a giant among men for theoretically admitting that I might have erred in my previous assessment of The Vig.  A 2 star swing seems like a lot, but as I said in my earlier review, The Vig was at least A-OK, even at night...on a lazy Saturday afternoon, chatting, laughing, drinking and eating with the great love of my life, The Vig is easily a 4 star experience:)

The beautiful Carin and I decided to go dinner last night and wanted something burger, within walking distance. I had seen a review of Fusion and the burger looked pretty good so we decided to try it. WOW!!! I have had most of the burgers in the greater Phoenix area and around the USA, and this is in the top 5 of any burger, anywhere ( I am including Taylor's Refresher in St. Helena, CA and the BigAss at Roaring Fork, among others). This thing was more than I could eat (admittedly after the more than delicious Panko breaded Calamari appetizer and a really good vodka martini).  The caramelized onions and jalapenos are the perfect sweet counterpoint to the meat, bacon and cheese and chili/cheese sauce on the burger. I brought about 1/4 of the burger home and I think it will be lunch today. Carin had the same thing (we both just wanted a good burger and wanted to try something different...we have been to Stax, etc., and they are good, but this was decadent).  The prices were good ($48 for 2 burgers, an appetizer and the marti), and I understand they have 1/2 price happy hour during the week, so we will be going back soon!!!  The service was also terrific, our waiter was attentive without being intrusive, the elements of the meal showed up exactly on time, and we had chance to have really nice chat with one of the owners, Jen Lynn ( I hope I spelled that somewhat correctly).  I recoomend that you give this place try, esp. if you are burger fan.

It is not always about the cocktails and the food.  Sometimes it's about the quieter, more scholarly pursuits. That's when I turn to my old friend, the Scottsdale Public Library (not "liberry"). This place is truly a gem and something the City of Scottsdale really does right.  I tend to use the Civic Center branch most often, these days, since I live nearby (although I used the Arabian Branch when I lived up north and I have been to all the branches over the years).  I love to read, and while I seem to buy several dozen books a year, it's great to be able to use the library for those tomes that I do not necessarily want to add to MY library. I love to just walk in and smell the old paper and typical "library" smell. I love to browse the shelves and I can lose myself in the racks for hours!  Here's the rest of the story (with apologies to the late Paul Harvey, although why I need to apologize to dead guy, I don't know...it sounded better in my head than it looks once I write it down...oh well...leave it in). Once you go and get your library card, you have access to all of the services the library has to offer...amazing , amazing services and tools! Did you know that you can borrow from the Library of Congress through these folks?  You can certainly use and borrow from all libraries in AZ using your card? Did you know they have thousands of DVD's and CD's as well as podcast books and music? Did you know that they have the big boy subscription to Lexis-Nexis so that you don't have to buy one?  Did you know that they have subscribed to more than 50 different research sites and databases so that you don't have to?  Did you know that you can access all this on line, so you can get the hook up from anywhere (I have gotten really useful info-bits while waiting for connecting flights, using my aircard halfway around the world...good stuff!). Did you know that they have scores (go look that up if you don't know what a "score" is...good way to get to know the library:) of educational programs for everything from languages to crafts to wildlife and history to music and software usage skills (not everyone is a zen master with excel or word). The library itself is a beautiful piece of architecture on the inside, beautiful lines and soothing colors and lighting, with great natural light for reading in the very comfortable chairs by the windows overlooking the park (I can't really say that about the exterior, but it is right in the park so it does have that going for it). I have always enjoyed a good library...we don't spend enough time just thinking and good library encourages you to sit down for bit, read for bit and think for a bit, all good things to do! It's free!

I have to lawyer up a little early in my review this time...http://tinyurl.com/4julqg  Do you miss the simple, twisted genius of Warren Zevon, too?  At any rate, to fully disclose,  I know the owner of WCG personally and businessally...You'll just have to trust me when I tell you that this didn't shade my review...in fact quite the opposite...I have been sitting on this for a while...trying to figure out how write this without sounding like a shill!  Then I thought, "Well, Donald, everyone is still entitled to my own opinion" so here we go!  WCG is one of my favorite places in the Greater Phoenix Area for a number of reasons:  * The menu is so varied, creative and well executed...everything from the Mesquite Grilled Artichokes to the Roasted Chicken to the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad and my favorite, the Maytag Burger (more about that in a minute) is well prepared and delicious  * The service has always been first rate (and I have to say that I expected that when the server is aware that I am friends with Bobby, but there are ton of people there that don't know me from Tyler Florence and we still get great service!)  * Extraordinary care in the preparation of the food, from the grinding of the beef for my burger to the grilling of the artichokes and the construction of the puff pastry crust Apple Pie for desert...they pay incredible attention to detail  * The atmosphere and ambience remind me (and not by accident) of one of my Northern California favorites, the Rutherford Grill...all cherry tones, leather and soft lighting...it always puts me in a great mood and compels me to eat more than I should  Today was no different...The Beautiful Carin and I stopped in for a lunch meeting to discuss our business, our branding, goal setting for the company (is world domination within 48 months too lofty a goal?) and what not (I set foot in this Northern California inspired place and I start to sound like Ah-nold again and so forth).  For my lunch, I had one of the best burgers in town...the Maytag Burger...they grind the meat on the premises, daily, fresh...no kidding!  For the "Maytag" portion of this earthly delight, they bake and crumble the bacon into the Maytag Bleu Cheese (notice my fancy French spelling there...merci') and form it into a disk of cheese and bacon that they drop onto the burger a few seconds before it's done and voila'...the best bacon/bleu cheese burger around...bacon and cheese in every bite...genius!  Carin has her favorites, too...the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad is one, as is the Spit Roasted Chicken and some of the best Crab Cakes you'll find west of Baltimore.  I smile every time I walk into WCG...I smile even more (and I usually burp a little, too) when I walk out after another great meal!  But don't take my word for it (another disclaimer to end my review on the right note)...go see for yourself...and try the Apple Pie...you'll be happy you did (and quite possibly burping in delight, as well).

I had nearly forgotten what a fish wrapper the last remaining daily newspaper in Phoenix really is...until I started sneezing again while trying to read it on my last trip to the Valley of the Sun.  Trying to read this rag (apparently printed on the toilet paper quality newsprint, using some sort of "ink" that causes massive nasal irritation, smears, rubs off and immediately blackens my hands and stains my clothes) is an exercise in frustration.  While the paper itself is physically unappealing, the actual content is almost unreadable...I have not seen so many typos, grammatical errors and factual misstatements since the last time I wrote a business plan!  But, my business isn't reporting...or writing...or even advertising!  In theory, that is the business of the AZ Republic.  Especially reporting!  I read about the Fiesta Bowl Fiasco investigation this morning...what a blockbuster!  I read about all the shenanigans that were known for years to everyone even peripherally around the people involved in the Fiesta Bowl...everyone except the publisher of the AZ Republic who was on the Fiesta Bowl Executive committee.  I didn't read about a bunch of other Fiesta Bowl stuff that I've heard about for years...they must still be "investigating".  I expect that the publisher thought that all the free trips, free tickets, free hookers and blow and the rest of the swag were handed out just because he, Russell, and John were such cool guys!  Of course, that's just rumor...I'm no investigative journalist...but then I'm not sure they have any of those at the Republic, either.  I understand that newspapers are in some trouble...they haven't, by and large, figured out how to change their business model to adapt to the new paradigm...they were caught off guard (much like Russell in an ambush interview yesterday).  But the "solutions" being deployed by the Republic to try to "save" their paper (poor quality paper and ink: major cuts to reporting and editorial staff, creative content and more) are reminiscent of every other business that has missed the signs of changing times and then cut everything useful in a effort to save dollars and their hides.  It kind of makes me wonder what else they missed.  At the end of the day, this paper, like many others, will likely rest on the scrapheap of broken businesses along with the telegraphs that used to bring important news from far away places and the Smith Corona's they used to use to type their stories.

I hadn't been to Tarbell's in while and I always enjoy the food there, so the Beautiful Carin and I went for dinner a couple of nights ago. As always the food was first rate.  Carin and split a Caesar salad (I think that's becoming a theme with us, but the Caeser here is pretty good, with anchovies on request). I had the salmon, which I hadn't had before, and it was good (I don't usually get seafood in Phoenix...even Salt Cellar, Wildlfish, Ocean Club, etc., don't really measure up to Portland, Seattle and SFO, where I spent so much of my misspent youth). Carin had the pan-roasted chicken, which is also quite good. On previous visits I have had the mustard Pork Chop (which I can also recommend) and the Cheese burger (which isn't as good as others in the area. Add a couple of glasses of Syrah and it was a very pleasant dinner.  The service was good (attentive but not intrusive or rushed) and while not cheap at $100 for 2, it's not the priciest by a good big margin, and well worth it! I think of Tarbells when I want something that's comfortable but upscale and a little bit different (not just another steak or grilled Chilean Sea Bass with some kind of glaze). Mark Tarbell has thought this place out pretty well, and it's a very appealing spot.

It's twofer Friday in the review column (I know, it should be 2-fer Tuesday, but that's just not how things worked out). After lunch at Stax, my daughter and I took a short stroll down Scottsdale Rd. to the G-spot. I have had coffee there in the morning few times, but I had not been in the mood for gelato at 7:10 am, while walking our pup. So today, in spite of the freezing temperatures outside, we had a gelato. Really good gelato! These guys are the real deal and the gelato is, I think, comparable to pretty much anything you'll find in Italy. I'm pretty pedestrian, and to me it's almost impossible to beat good old vanilla bean (I did taste the strawberry, too, and it was also delightful). The gelato was smooth and creamy, not too sweet, just great stuff! Whitney, my daughter had something chocolate and italian, which, try as I might, I can't remember the name of. She has more gelato experience than I do, and also thought hers was great. So, why 4 stars instead of 5? The 2 people (kids?) behind the counter. They could barely be bothered to respond to us, and appeared to very clearly not want to be there. I wouldn't go so far as to say the service was bad, but when I say "thank you" to someone or ask a question, I would like to get a response. So good coffee and gelato, with a little attitude on the side, at the G-Spot.

In keeping with the Italian theme today, I decided gelato would make nice sweet treat after my delightful experience at Best of Italy (see how I interweave these things together...but wait, there's more!). In a rare "daily double" I am able to interweave National Pizza Party Day (come on...pizza is mostly Italian) with National Strawberry Month...That's right...strawberry Gelato!!!! There has been much less attitude and better  service by the staff on my recent visits to the G-Spot, and for that they get my thanks and my gelato dollars. It's funny, ever since Gabi posted the thread about strawberries...I've had a bit of a craving. G-Spot...you scratched my itch very nicely today:)

I don't miss much about Portland...but what I do miss, I miss a lot!  With specific regard to good eats, I miss Lew's Dairy Freeze where they sold almost mystical coney island hot dogs...what the hell did they put in that sauce?!?!?   It was great!  I also miss Sumida's...Sumida san was sushi chef of the first water...trained as a sushi master since boyhood, he was the real deal.  I loved to go to Sumida's for lunch and watch sumo on the big screen TV (Sumida san had a satellite dish...live sumo:) and eat until I felt like I was going to explode...so good, so relaxed, so "homey"...I even got know who was who in sumo:)  Flash forward through SF to Scottsdale and directly to Dozo!  No sumo on the big screen, but everything else is right at Dozo.  Robert, the sushi master and owner is as scrupulous about his fish and process as Sumida san was and the results show in the sushi and sashimi...beautiful feasts for the eyes and a treat for your palette:) I had a business lunch there yesterday (that's right, I am getting to pick the lunch spots again:)  I had the sushi and sashimi lunch...a bargain at $13!...nigiri sushi and sashimi, along with a salad and miso soup:) The sushi and sashimi are chef selections and always presented beautifully, created fresh for you, in the moment, by the sushi master:)   I was going to go into detail about what he made for me but you know what, your sushi experience will be different and you should go to Dozo and try all of it...I have:)  It's a sublime experience...I think a good sushi master knows what I want better than I do:)  My lunch companion was not a sushi fan and went for the salmon teriyaki...he pronounced it some of the best he's ever had...always a reasonably good indicator of satisfaction:)  There is not much more to tell you about Dozo...I don't know if it's the best in town (I hear good things about Yasu), but it may be the best in Scottsdale:)  If they had sumo on the big screen, I might never leave:)  Domo Arigato, Mr. Roberto:)

Sherman, set the Wayback machine for 1961, we are going to the Hotel Valley Ho, in a little patch of desert called "Scottsdale, Arizona". It was my birthday this week and my kids were in town to make sure that I continue to get older:) I did get older, but not by much...and certainly no wiser:) We stayed at the Valley Ho, so I could celebrate in style (and keep the condo neat and tidy:) It wasn't so much a "staycation", as it was a chance to live a little differently for few days. You don't turn 40 for the first time very often and this seemed like a memorable way to mark the date:) When we checked in at the Valley Ho, the Chairman (Frank Sinatra) was styling his way through "Luck be a Lady" and we thought we had stepped back to a simpler time...a time in which celebrity was worshiped and fawned over, just because they are famous...a time when you could lounge by the pool and day-drink your cares away...a time when just getting yourself to the bar was enough work for one day:) In short, we stepped squarely into 2009:) The Valley Ho delivers on the promise of nostalgia for an unremembered past...a mid-century revival of the avocado green, pastel turquoise and rust orange memories that almost none of us share, but that we all long for. The Valley Ho takes you to the Disney version of 1961 and damn it, I liked it...a lot! I found myself thoroughly enjoying the suite (the room and the hotel look like the '60's, but with HDTV, iPod plugs, decent tubs, good cell phone reception, double headed showers and really comfortable beds:) I found myself wishing for the return of fins on my car and car hops on roller skates, along with $.25 a gallon gas and $.25 a gallon Tequila (almost interchangeable for both drinking and fueling purposes:) Room service, spa, workout facility, restaurant and the pool are all first rate, and the people watching is wonderful...this place has become a destination again! The pool is a terrific place to give people watching a real workout:) The Oh Bar pours a nice drink and they keep 'em comin! Lots of eye candy for the guys and girls to ogle and everybody mixing and mingling like there is no tomorrow...and maybe that's true! Maybe there is no tomorrow at the Valley Ho...When you step through the time warp back to 1961, but get to bring your 2009 stuff with you...the price you pay is getting stuck in the vortex of "now"...but at the Valley Ho, "now" seems to work:)

Do you know what they have at Butterfields?  They have a Belgian Waffle (and I capitalize because it's important here) with crumbled up Bacon in the waffle...in the waffle!  They cook the bacon into the waffle right in the old waffle iron:)  Well...next to a bacon filled old fashioned donut, this may the closest we get to a perfect ten in "food combinations/breakfast division":)  The Beautiful Carin and I needed a little sustenance on Sunday morning and found ourselves reasonably close to Butterfields (actually, we were right down the street from the Breakfast Club, but who needs that cluster:)  We hadn't been to Butterfields for several months and the time was ripe for "revisit" so I could "score the review":)  I'm pretty glad we did!  Summertime is probably a better time to get your Butterfields fix...on a Sunday in January the wait gets a little crazy...north of an hour with a line of Dame Edna lookalikes standing at the counter asking if their table is ready because they're sure they felt their pager go off...it didn't really go off...just the friction of Teflon against titanium in their hip replacements every time they shift their considerable bulk:)  This past Sunday, the wait at 12:30 was zero minutes:)  Butterfields is technically a "chain"...three locations separated from each other by thousands of miles...they don't feel like a chain:)  They have a bunch of nice touches at Butterfields...a big mechanical juicer where they feed crates of oranges in the top and fresh juice comes out the bottom...heavy cream for the coffee (a truly delightful "bloom" of cream when you pour it in the coffee:), Vermont maple syrup and other nice, high quality touches:)  The menu runs from a selection of Benedict's (including the Bubba, with gravy and sausage instead of Canadian Bacon and Hollandaise) to a selection of assorted Dutch Babies and Apple pancakes.  I've tried a bunch of these tasty little treats and they are serious health food (by which I mean that if you eat here too often, you will need to see your healthcare professional...seriously:)  But, back to the aforementioned Waffle...you order that, a side of sausage, two sunnyside up eggs ( which you slide onto your buttered waffle)...syrup the whole thing and eat until the pee stick says you're approaching a diabetic coma:)  Carin had a nice breakfast, too!   Some sort of omelet!   She said it was good, but I forget anything else after the sugar shock took me down:)

After golf today, I just didn't want to eat at the course. Nothing against the little snack bar there, and I'm sure it's just fine, but this was my chance to hit Kinfolk's again. I try not to eat barbecue too often...my doctor is on me about cholesterol, etc., so I try to be good, as much as can, but sometimes you just can't resist and this is that day. I have been going to Kinfolk's for the past few years and I think it is one of the top 2 barbecue joints in the Phoenix area. Today I had the standard...pulled pork sandwich, fries and quart mason jar full of coca dieta...wow did that taste great! The pork is tender and juicy, very smokey (no parboiled fake barbecue here). The sauces are homemade and extremely flavorful. The hot is not so hot that drowns the flavor out, the sweet isn't so sweet that it drowns out he vinegar bite...just great stuff! I have had the pork ribs, the chicken, the brisket and the beef ribs. I agree with another reviewer that beef ribs could use a little something...the only place I have ever found beef ribs done right is Kansas City...but I digress. The sides are terrific, the beans, the slaw, the fries are all very tasty and the only problem is that there is just too much food (I ended up bringing home 1/2 my sandwich again today). The prices are really very good...it seem like the price for sandwich or a rack of ribs is the same as some other places (Honey Bears, etc.), but the portions are so much larger, so I think it's a bargain. Great guilty pleasure and a kind of a hole in the wall at the same time, so a twofer!

Great Clips is nothing special, in and of itself, but sometimes the people there are! I have been getting my hair cut by Great Clips at 32nd and Camelback since I moved to Phoenix...by accident. I used to go to Ahmet's when I lived in SFO...a truly wonderful barber shop. They do the hot lather straight razor shaves, hot towels, shoulder rubs, straight razor haircuts, brandy in the winter and scotch in the summer, small stash of Playboys and Penthouse magazines, all to take the pain out of getting your ears lowered!  Really, the male equivalent of "spa day".  I had heard about V's when I moved to town and I was going to go over there...it sounded a lot like Ahmet's. But I got sidetracked and ended up going to this Great Clips for a "quick trim" to tide me over.  At Great Clips, I met Teresa, who used to work at V's, and she has been cutting my hair since. Now, I am not a "pretty" man, I don't have "symmetrical" features, I don't have "all my own" teeth, I don't always remember to "comb my hair", and my hairline is moving back toward my ears, but Teresa makes me look as good as I can possibly look. No, it's Great Clips...I don't get a scotch or a brandy with my haircut, and I don't get the hot towel and hot lather straight razor shaves, (although Teresa can do all those things).  I do get a straight razor haircut that is consistently the best haircut that I have ever had, along with the straight razor neck trim and sideburn trim. And, they only charge me $13.  I am almost sad to write this because I always have to wait for Teresa and now it will probably get worse.  But she deserves to be as popular as she is...if she can make me look presentable...she's a hair-cutting genius!

Jim W had an interesting thread the other day "what do you miss?" I don't miss many things about living in the bay, but getting my dim sum fix once a month or so is one of them. I had my office on Market St. and I had a Yank Sing in the alley right behind my building...I could go for dim sum at lunch, let the dishes pile up and waddle back to my office for nice long afternoon nap:) If I felt more ambitious, I could walk up to Chinatown to Delicious, New Fortune and Yong Kee for some of the most remarkable food this side of Hong Kong! It was especially pleasant when we got 4-5 of us to go, and just sit and talk and eat for couple of hours...the art of dim sum:) With that in mind, I headed out for the near reaches of Chandler this past Saturday. Jim and Audrey W. organized a dim sum outing at the Phoenix Palace Buffet (I frankly didn't notice the buffet...I'm sure it was there and very good...I was just too busy pointing at bamboo steamers and bowls and plates and saying "give me that one please":) Jim organized the outing after fellow Yelper Helen Y had noted that this place had changed ownership, chefs, etc., and is now quite good! (I now have 2 things to be grateful to Helen Y. for...helping us find good dim sum in greater Phoenix and allowing me to become a citizen of the Republic of Sweet:) We were joined on our outing by Kevin H (in an interesting side note, Kevin got ROTD for...Phoenix Palace Buffet on the exact same day that we went for dim sum!!! What are the odds!?:), Marian H. and Dottsy Z.  The Beautiful Carin wasn't able to make it...she had a little stomach bug and stayed in bed:(  I was going to stay home and take care of her, but the lure of potentially good dim sum was too great!:) Off I went with cheery wave and a lilting "feel better" hanging in the air as the door slammed before she changed her mind and asked me to stay around and nurse her back to health:) She's a strong girl...I knew she would pull through:) Boy, am I glad I went! The company and conversation were wonderful...everyone cheered me up about having to leave my better half at home (and as anyone who knows us will attest, Carin really is the better half...maybe the better 75%:) It was a perfect dim sum afternoon!  We talked, pointed at the carts, ate, talked and ate, talked and ate:)  I think dim sum is as much about conversation and relaxation as about the food...but having said that, having great food really adds to both the conversation and relaxation factor of a great dim sum lunch...and the food was remarkable! It was so good!  There might be a couple of shops that top this place in SFO, but not by much...it's that good! We had all the standards, shrimp rolls, pork buns, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, sticky rice (outstanding sticky rice, BTW). We had some of the non-standards, tripe, chive dumplings...all delicious and served up with smile! The service was very good...there were always carts in close proximity, and if you saw something a few tables away and flagged a server down, they always made their way over to help you out:) drinks were refilled promptly, and the empty dishes were moved out to make room for new arrivals. The biggest surprise came at the end of our lunch...the total for 6 of us was less than $70!!! I used to spend more than that for dim sum lunch for 2 in SFO (and twice that much in HK)! Amazing! Jim, thanks for organizing! It was a great lunch with a fun group! It's great to know where to get my dim sum fix!

I like to patronize businesses that do exactly what they say they are going to do...and do it with smile:)  Cartridge World is one of those places:)  They say they will save you bundle on ink and toner cartridges for your printers...you know what?...that's exactly what they do!  The Beautiful Carin and I have 5 printers in our offices and one or another is often in need of a replacement cartridge.  Before I found good old CW, it was easy to go through $100 or more in ink for printers every month...every freakin' month!  No more...cartridges for one of my HP's (that cost almost $40 a pop, even at Costco) are only $12 (when I take the empty cartridge in to exchange for a fresh one:)...That seems like a pretty good deal, to me:)  I also need to add that I have had exactly one cartridge that didn't work well, in the past 3 - 4 years of using CW (a better average than buying brand new, BTW)...you know what CW did?...They honored their warranty and they replaced my defective cartridge with a smile:)   Finally, they have a Cartridge World Frequent Flyer punch card...buy 10 and get 1 free:)   I just love free!  Next time you need a little ink, give these guys a try...they will save you more than enough to get a couple of burgers up the road at Lucky Boy:)

I had a little problem with the turbocharger on my car (and I think we would all agree that life without "turbo" is pretty nearly unbearable! :-) Turns out the turbocharger wastegate solenoid was sticking...man I hate it when that happens!  But my trusty mechanic at Radiator King (Steve may truly be an automotive genius) quickly, expertly (and inexpensively:) diagnosed and repaired said wastegate solenoid while I went and enjoyed lunch! Delightful! I wandered across the lot trying to decide between Andreoli Italian Deli and Vermont Sandwich Company. I decided on VSC, because when you think about it...a whole company, devoted to sandwiches! :-)  Geez! What a good idea! What if other companies devoted themselves to what they say they do? What if US Air and United Airlines were really in the business of expertly flying people around? What if GM and Chrysler were  truly in the business of building adequate and serviceable vehicles? What if AIG had actually been in the insurance business? What a world this could be. Happily, VSC is the real deal.  Their devotion to sandwiches and the related accouterments is real and touching in its sincerity:) Walking into the establishment, you are confronted by an almost overwhelming array of choices...fear not, they will (with a smile, BTW:) help you navigate through the menu. The place itself is very "Vermonty"...an eclectic blend of painted 2x4 stud walls and 2x4 tchotchke shelves with all manner of toy cars, salt and pepper shakers, small pictures, etc. That's juxtaposed with Deadhead posters, Phish memorabilia, Dave Matthews Band paraphernalia and Live In Brooklyn playing in the background. I ordered a "Long Trail", a very Vermonty reference to the Green Mountains of Vermont and the hiking trail through those mountains (an incredibly beautiful hike, if you ever get the chance:) with a frosty hand squeezed lemonade...lunch as it was meant to be:) The Long Trail is a softball size wad of house roast beef, shaved super thin and served on 9 grain bread (in my case...I don't really care for sourdough, but VSC will happily customize for you:), with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, horseradish mayo, pickles, gruyere and...wait for it...crumbled bacon!  It was a nearly perfect roast beef sandwich! It came with potato salad...really good potato salad!!...not far from what I would make for myself:) A word about the sides at most sandwich shops...that word is "crap":) Too often the sides are, at best, uninteresting afterthoughts...at worst, something inedible, bought in 55 gallon drums from Costco:( Not here! They make their own potato salad, slaw and pasta salad...all are fresh and tasty! I felt like I had taken a pleasant little trip to Vermont in the summer and found myself a great little sandwich place off the Long Trail...and I didn't even have to endure the garbage scows of the skies at US Air to get there:)

I have a secret and it's a blockbuster!  I know the location of the Best Circle K on the planet!!!!  It's right here...really...right friggin' here!  It's one of those situations where the stars all aligned and everything turned out perfectly...we don't know why and we don't want to question divine providence...we just want it to continue to be great!  Over the years, I've seen my share of Circle K's, 7-11's, AM/PM's and their locally owned brethren...most of them smell and look like an overheated  dorm room after a drunken 12 person orgy (don't ask me how I know this...I would have to tell you and you just can't "unhear" some things).  And while I (much like you) need to occasionally use one of these markets ("what!...I thought you were bringing ice"..."we're out of butter on Thanksgiving?"..."oh well...off I go!"), I have tried to keep those foray's short and when I do have to drop in, I usually wear latex gloves so I don't actually have to come into contact with any surfaces in these places.    However, this particular Circle K is so very clean (I guess to keep the resort trade from the Valley Ho and the squatters living in the remains of the now defunct Ramada Inn across the street, happy), and so very well stocked and run, that it will alter your understanding of what the phrase "convenience store" is really supposed to mean!  To wit:  * Want Costco like special prices on a large selection of some really terrific wines and specialty beers? This Circle K has 'em!  * You need a quick refill on either infant or adult diapers?...Drop by for a "reload".  * Want a decent cup of coffee on the go? Circle K fills the bill (no, it's not as good as Sola's coffee, but geez, it's  1/2 the price of those places and for the price, it's really a decent cup of coffee)  * How about a hot, dog, polish, one of those rolled burrito dealies or a slurpee?...you can get any of those and much more in a non-sticky, non-smelly, clean and friendly environment!  * Need Handy Wipes for the "homeless shower" since there isn't water and electricity at the Ramada...done and done!  I want to emphasize...this is the best Circle K on earth...right here in the friendly confines of Old Town Scottsdale (and Old Town Scottsdale really is friendly...why just this morning, I found a used condom on the street while I was out walking Deedee...what could be friendlier than that!?!?)  The employees here are all pleasant and helpful, the shelves are clean, organized and well stocked, the drink and food areas are scrupulously clean...you get a choice of crushed or cubed ice...and you'll always get a smile and gracious "thanks" from the clerks (even when I use my credit card for an $0.86 drink!)  So, for three plus years of consistently great service, clean surroundings and for being there when I needed them, a solid 5 stars as the very best of the convenience store breed!

Carin is on a shoot today, so after squash and visiting the Red Seven Grand Opening, I dropped by the set to watch my girl get in touch with her inner child (I understand that's how actors do it...make believe...pretend stuff:)  I had actually never seen her on a set before and I was amazed by all the camera's, monitors, people running around...it was quite a production...oh wait...I guess that's why they call it "a production" :-)  After I left the set, I was motoring down Goldwater and saw a sign out in front of Old Town Deli that said, and I quote - "1/4 pound Boar's Head Hot Dog - $3.00" :-)  Yes please!  I was starving and boy did that dog hit the spot...they use all Boar's Head meats and sausages...they also have breakfast's and they make deli sandwiches...they do salads and soups...in short, they are exactly what they say they are...the Old Town Deli...and they do a nice job:)  Best of all...free delivery of your sandwich, salad, soup and what not:)  No, they aren't a kosher deli...they aren't a bakery and they don't have the seemingly unlimited menu that my buddies at Scott's Generations do, but they are a perfectly serviceable little deli and they are very nice people:)  It's a quick and inexpensive place to grab a bite in Old Town...and did I mention...they deliver...for free:-)

Inside or outside?...Soup or salad?...Cheese or no cheese?...Blondes or Brunettes?  We all have our preferences and I am no different.  I have never had a relationship with a redhead go smoothly and Wendy is not an exception:(  She's never really been good to me, although she's occasionally surprised me with something fun and spicy (like a deep fried spicy chicken sandwich that will set your mouth on fire:)  But in the end, she's always been a bit of a disappointment...for a lot of reasons.  Wendy whispers sweet nothings in my ear...things like "always fresh, never frozen" and "made when you order it", yet the burgers are always dripping with moisture and grease...clearly partially cooked and then waiting in a bin next to the grill:(  Wendy always asks me "how do you want it?"...so coquettish...so provocative...so beguiling!  And yes... I do tell her how I want it...and she nearly always gets it wrong...clumsily...inconsiderately...often incoherently and unpleasantly wrong:(  I tell her she needs to make it right...and she makes an attempt to satisfy...but I can tell her heart isn't in it:(  I vow that I will not darken her door again, but then I find myself in a tight spot where Wendy is the only one that has what I need...right there...right then...and I succumb.  That was the situation last week...busy, busy, so very busy, last week!  Hard workout...needed a retoxing...almost late for a meeting...empty drive through lane at Wendy's...  Well, you can guess the rest yourself...no need for me to go into the sordid details...except to say that maybe I've gotten a little bit smarter about this crazy redhead...This time, I didn't pull out until I got exactly what I wanted:)   Pull out of the drive through...of the drive through...what did you think I meant?

The AC was not working at lunchtime (although it was only 101 in the shade at noon, and plenty toasty inside)...didn't matter...the place was packed and for good reason!  Huauchinango is terrific!  The place was not, however, packed with Northern European Ice Age survivors like myself...It was packed with my bretheren and sisteren from south of the border.  Other than a brief conversation with the owner and some chat with my luncheon companion, every other conversation was spanish and the only other word I heard that I really understood was "GOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLL" from the soccer match on the tiny TV above my head (they love their soccer at Huauchinango)!  And they love their genuine, authentic, non-amercanized food...not tex-mex, not even sonoran...Puebla...SSE of Mexico City, on your way to the Yucatan!  I haven't had anything like this since the last time I was in "real" non-resort Mexico (which has been few years, admittedly...too many decapitations...I'm old and feeble and the thought of having someone try to chop my head off...well...it's not appealing).  But I'm as safe at Huauchinango as if I were in my own Heavenly Bed !  And better fed.  All menu items are in Spanish...just as well because it seems that approx. 98% of their customers are Mexican with a craving for real home cooking...and that's what they get!  From Chiliaquiles to Huaraches to Gorditas and Burros, Carne Asada, Pastor and beef rinds to Tripe and Tostadas (I can't remember how spell any of that in Spanish...but the menu has english sub-titles, so you will be good to go) it's all fresh, freshly made and quite delicious!  Let's talk salsa's...they have a small salsa bar that they are justifiable proud of...a truly sublime green tomatillo/cilantro salsa, a spicy and savory red salsa and a demure orange habanero salsa (it looks so innocent yet will turn your mouth to cellophane and then light a match to it...seriously, if you are not used to spicy, you will feel like you just ate the sun)...I have to add though,  that the habanero salsa is not just hot, but really very tasty!  You will be missing something if you don't give it spin  Today I had a grilled beef Huaraches, with verde sauce and a peppery jalisco grated on top, and I split a red chili tamale with my lunch buddy (both suitably annointed with habanero salsa, so the burn will keep me awake at my desk this afternoon).  My buddy had a Quesadilla of some sort and a strawberry Agua Fresca, but didn't quite have the cajones to take on the habanero's.  We ate a mountain of absolutely authentic and well prepared mexican food, along with a never empty Diet Pepsi (HAHAHA...I love that about myself...food cooked in lard and a diet beverage) that set me back a whopping $6.59 for my half (before tip).  And I tipped lavishly...because they treated me like long lost cousin (I think it was respect for habanero salsa skills) and because they consistently deliver one of the best meals I have found at a price that I couldn't beat at Mickey D's!  Go, try something different and find out what real Mexican food tastes like...it's astonishing!  And give the old college try to the habanero salsa...you will thank me...at least until tomorrow morning...

I work with technology for a living...it seems that almost all of my working discussions are centered around technology, and even friendly discussions seem to get around to discussions of the lastest and greatest from the Valley (Silicon Valley...no the other Silicon Valley:)  When it's time to relax, I like to curl up in my sock drawer with a good book...not a Kindle (I'm know, they are wonderful, but I just prefer the feel and aroma of a real book:)  What can I say...I'm as old as dirt and occasionally nostalgic for simpler things:)  I have the library close by, but they don't always have the newest (or the oldest) books to choose from...that's when I wander down the street to Borders:)  Sure, I wander to other book stores...several rare and antique book stores in Old Town, but they don't have the latest David Baldacci at those joints (and won't have it until the signed first edition becomes "rare" in another 95 years...I can't wait that long to read it:), so Borders is the default:)  And a serviceable default, at that:)  They have a wonderful and extensive selection, specials, frequent flyer programs and a lovely little coffee shop upstairs, where you can take your time and look over your prospective purchases (or even your actual purchases:) over a cup of pretty decent coffee (Seattle's Best Coffee:)  While they say "Seattle's Best" coffee on their sign, I don't know that I would go that far...it's really not even Scottsdale's Best coffee.  I would call it Scottsdale's Best Book Store Coffee, since it is good and it's in the book store:)  One thing that Seattle's Best Coffee in a Borders Book Store does very well is a little treat that they call "Kola"...real soda jerked cola...if you are any kind of Coke or Pepsi fan, you may want to give this try...it's astonishingly good and takes me back to the days of my youth when a real Coke from the soda fountain was definite treat:)  I really don't know of anyplace else that you can get a real soda jerked cola anymore...I know you can get a lot of other things jerked in Scottsdale, but a soda?...not so much:)  So drop by Borders, pick up a little something to read and have them jerk you a Kola...treat yourself:-)

This is pretty little golf course!  I generally prefer a course that doesn't have a million houses surrounding it, but there is some architectural diversity in the homes around Gainey, and the course itself is very appealing. I played the Dunes/Lakes rotation today (Gainey Ranch has 27 holes, which is great from both a variety and pace of play perspective). The course has a nice variety of terrain and is well kept and lush. The Lakes has water in play on several holes, and requires accurate approach shots on a number of holes. The Dunes, while somewhat drier, has its own difficulties to navigate, with a number of dry washes, and desert terrain, as well as a narrowing of the landscape in the driving areas for the big hitters. If you tend to leak your shots (or somewhat more than leak) this will be a difficult course on which to score well. It is hard to start a shot at a house and hope that it slides back to the right and in play! The course is very well maintained and the service is first rate (it is a country club, after all). Beverage carts are plentiful and well stocked, so that adds to the fun! They have a nice patio for a beer after the round, and it's a pleasant 19th hole, to sit and recount the good shots and forget the average after the round. If they would let me walk the course, it would be just about perfect!

This was an interesting Fremont Street Experience. We were there about an hour and we saw: 1 Apparent drug arrest...suspect prostrate on the ground with 4 officers searching his pockets, backpack, etc., and; 2 fistfights, one of which was between 2 girls who had just come out of a "gentleman's club", and; 1 altercation between the family of another girl who had come out of the  gentleman's club and didn't want to go back to Iowa (sorry we overheard, but this was all shouted between 4 family members and the runaway, loudly enough that the police came over to referee), and; 6-8 attempts to aggressively panhandle us. In a slightly contracted word...don't.

The Beautiful Carin and I had to go to Las Vegas on business a couple of weeks ago. While I think Las Vegas is a fine little city, I don't particularly like the Strip. But, sometimes business calls and you do what you need to do. When you need to be on the Strip, you can do far worse than the Trump. Donald Trump's Hotel...if you have to go to Las Vegas, for me, it's either this one or the Four Seasons (but the Trump is closer to more of the "attractions" of Las Vegas). The Trump is everything The Donald says he wants his hotel to be, luxurious, gold, spectacular, understated, gold, elegant, world class, gold, lavish, sumptuous and of course, gold. I really do like the Trump (I kid because I love). The service is everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel; there is no casino to fight your way through to get to the elevators to your room (although there is a guard in the elevator lobby to make sure that only guests get in, thank you!); the Trump is non-smoking so...kudos! Most importantly, the Trump really is a quality, luxury hotel! They treated us like royalty, from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. They upgraded us to very nice suite, no charge (really nice touch), they remembered our names, they talked to us like people (not walking tip machines), and made us feel welcome and comfortable. First, the room...a beautiful suite with a view out to the strip (the Trump is about 2 blocks off the strip, but a nice view anyway). The suite was decadent. Huge, with a living room, formal dining room and service kitchen, and full master suite for the bedroom (and a steam shower, with multiple shower heads) and in a particularly nice touch, a TV hidden in the bathroom mirror, including a remote that you can use from the huge and luxurious spa/tub. The furnishings are on a par with any very nice home. Next, the ambiance...relaxed, open, friendly and calming (again...no casino...hurrah!). You can have a cocktail in the lobby bar or by the pool and feel both pampered and comfortable at the same time. I will review the restaurants in another review, but they are terrific and by extension, the room service was outstanding. Finally, the service...absolutely first rate! It's deferential, but not cloying or overbearing. Everyone from the general manager to bellmen and room service waiters acknowledged us and called us by name (never "you guys" or anything remotely like it...not allowed as we discovered from one of the pool attendants). They offered free limo's up and down the strip, to get us to dinner's, etc. I felt like a high roller in spite of the fact that I never gamble more then $2-300 when I'm in Las Vegas (do you suppose that's why I never get anything comped?). The Trump is a terrific place to stay in Las Vegas. It is, in a word Trumpulescent.

The Beautiful Carin and I were in Las Vegas on business a couple of weeks ago and had a couple of free evenings. I am not much of a gambler (although Carin can put some time in at the Blackjack tables), but when dinner time rolled around I was able to get her join me (even though she was on a roll!   We were at the Venetian and decide to eat there, at Zeffirino. I guess things are little slow, because even without a reservation, we were seated immediately.  They have a very nice bar and a good wine cellar (and some very nice "by the glass" selections. We started with martini's (excellent, BTW). We shared a lobster/truffle ravioli special appetizer and Carin had Capon, stuffed with Prosciutto and black truffles, and I had Mediterranean Sea Bass. Both were very good, the service was good (a little bit hovering, at times, but they were just trying to be nice), and the decor and ambiance were beautiful. The only down checks for this place come from the fact that it's in a casino, so still that smell of cigarette smoke; almost $150 for the light dinner I just described (no dessert, BTW...we had late dessert at another place) and the sort of hovering service (I just don't need to have someone inquire if everything is "wonderful" after every second bite). So, pretty good grub, but go on an expense account.

I don't know why I do this to myself...How long does it take to make a bowl of delicious and nutritious oatmeal, complete with cinnamon, nutmeg, maple, raisin's...you know something good for me?  I'll tell you how long...exactly 180 seconds...from scratch:)  But, I got busy this morning and forgot...again!  So I ran all morning long on nothing but coffee (which would be enough, some days...but not today:)  By the time I got done with power yoga (on an empty stomach), I was feeling decidedly in need of some serious retox...but I didn't go that way:)  I decided to try to eat something a little bit healthy...for a change:)  And, since I hadn't been to Bertha's in a couple of years, and they have their new location opened up, I dropped by Bertha's to grab a sandwich re-fortify me:)  I liked Bertha's prior incarnation, over behind the post office at 40th and Thomas, and I was pretty regular customer there for a couple of years.  This location, this version (Bertha's - version 1.5...it can't possibly be what they intended, and must therefore be a mid-release version), is lacking in few areas:  * Service - I used to appreciate that I was greeted with smile and a  "hi" when I walked in:)...not at Bertha's - v1.5...no "hello"...no "how can I help you"...no response to my "hi"...just a vacant stare until I decided what I was going to have, then writing followed by the total...that was it, followed by a shouted "ORDER" to the kitchen:(  * Quality - I appreciated that they always paid attention to details, and that my sandwiches, soup, baked treats, whatever, were always well prepared and tasty...When I got my Ham and Cheese Panini (to go...I was a little busy), no bag check and no napkins when I looked in the bag:(...I asked for them and was handed a wad of napkins with little more than a grunt...I headed down the road and opened up the sandwich...took one bite and found ice crystals in the middle of the ham:(...semi-warm on the outside and still frozen inside (or did the definition of "Panini" change while I wasn't looking?)  * Atmosphere - I liked the old space...I realize that Bertha's - v1.0 was small, but it was nice:)...the new release, Bertha's - v1.5 space looks and feels like the "remodeled on a budget" second hand clothing store that this space probably was...not a great room and not well done on the remodel...I was waiting for my sandwich and thinking "why were they closed for 5 months?...I could have done this remodel all by myself over a long weekend, for about $200, including the apartment white paint for the walls"  I made a completely legal U-Turn (as far as you know) and went back to Bertha's - v1.5, and asked them, about the ice in my Panini:(  No "oh, I'm sorry", no "can we make you another?"...just the blank stare from counter girl...  I suggested another attempt at Panini-ing my panini...she took it back to the kitchen, where I heard "It's still cold" and returned a couple of minutes later with my Panini (easily identifiable by my bite marks on the corner of the panini...  They microwaved the friggin' thing!!! :-(  I headed back to my car, and tried to eat my Panini...do you know what microwaving does to thick crusted Italian rolls?...It turns the crust to concrete, is what it does.  I was starving and I still only managed to get through about  1/4 of the Panini.  I think I am going to wait until the next release of Bertha's, to reload.  It could be that both Bertha's - v2.0 and Windows 7 will surprise and delight me...but I have my doubts.

I really want to like Sprinkles.  We live just a few blocks away, and the Beautiful Carin and I decided to walk over and have a cupcake after dinner. It is the third try (strike?) for Sprinkles.  I like cake and I especially like moist and flavorful cake. Sprinkles doesn't seem to be either. I had the Red Velvet and that is a hard kind of cake to make dry. I just don't know what they are doing wrong. Carin had a peanut butter cupcake and it was just flat. I have also had the cupcakes from Lulu's and Cupcake which I think are generally better, as well as cupcakes from Tammy Coe (which is, BTW the way cake is supposed to be). As I say, it was a nice evening for stroll and treat, but maybe I should have gone for a gelato, instead.

The Beautiful Carin and I were out and about this past Sunday evening. She was recovering from some sort of bug and had a little craving for something sweet. I would love to give Sprinkles another star (or even 2...I am a generous and thoughtful person:) for being open Sunday evening, when no one else was (and I do mean no one...we tried See's, anywhere else, etc...no dice). We went in and I swear, they had at least 10 employees behind the counter...Chief Greeting Officer, assistant to the greeter, Chief Order Taking Officer, assistant order taker, Chief Cupcake Hander Outer, assistant cupcake hander outer, Chief Money taker, and her assistant...you kind of begin to see why they charge $34 a pop for the cupcakes (no, not really...I'm exaggerating for "comic effect"...the cupcakes are only $20 each:) But they had a ton of folks working there...and when the door to the kitchen (I can't really call it a bakery) opened, there must have been another 15 oompa-loompa's scurrying around in there, mixing, icing, sprinkling, etc. With all that, you'd think they could make the best cupcake in the universe...no, not even close. On Sunday, they had the added advantage of being the only ones to show up for work and they still couldn't beat the locals.  I will say that the cupcakes seemed better than the last time (although still sub-par)...fresher...but I frankly attribute that to the fact that they were the only game in town and the cupped cakes weren't sitting around as long. Sadly, still 2 stars, even if they were the only place that was open.

In the interest of brevity (it being the soul of wit, although possibly not witticisms:), I will keep my review of Bunna brief. I only had one cup of coffee...the Guatemalan Dark Roast, but WOW...good coffee!  Good enough for Bunna to inspire another haiku -   a cup of dark roast makes my heart beat much faster with love, not caffeine  Good Coffee!

I met a business associate at Wally's for lunch today. It might have been the wrong day to go to Wally's.  Today is Cinco de Mayo and at Wally's, they were celebrating "Cinco de Wally's" (Wally's Five?!?!?...five what?) with a "special" menu. Boy, can I just state for the record that it is seldom a good idea for a restaurant to screw around by replacing their menu with ethnic food to celebrate holiday's. This goes certainly for "pubs" trying to get their Mexican fiesta on...it goes for Mexican restaurants trying to add corned beef on St. Patrick's Day...it goes for fine dining restaurants trying to add hot dogs and burgers on July 4th and it goes for Applebee's and their ilk trying to serve "turkey with all the trimmin's" on Thanksgiving. The results are at the very best uneven and at the worst, Cinco de Wally's. I sensed a problem at the start...they gave us a "special" menu with all Mexican food "especial's" and the only regular Wally's food available was the Wally burger and wings.  Oh well, a Wally burger it will have to be. My associate decide to risk it and ordered the chicken tacos, but offset it by having a margarita, which is, as we all know, a powerful flavor enhancer and pain reliever! The service was slow, but not really problematically slow...just not very attentive, at first. It took 10 minutes or so for our server to take our drink orders and another 5-10 minutes to get our drinks, but the pace picked up after that. We got our food and that's when the fun really started:) I ordered my burger medium with cheese...it arrived a delightful shade of un-medium gray in the middle, with no cheese.  My associates meal arrived and it was...a plate of lettuce!  The taco platter was supposed to be 6 small tacos (taco sliders?), but all we could see was a platter of shredded lettuce. Substantial digging produced the tiny tacos (and they were tiny...2 bites, at best), but no salsa, no cheese...just meat, tiny tortilla's and a hay mound of lettuce. We called the server over and I sent back my burger (you can't uncook a burger and I am reluctant to send food back to the kitchen, but this just wasn't correct) and my associate asked for cheese, salsa and sour cream, two of which he received (no sour cream at Wally's?...really?). I got my replacement burger and cut it in half...still no cheese, but by now, I was over my desire for a cheese burger and just wanted a little sustenance (5 mile run this morning...I was hungry:). I took a bite and the burger was essentially room temperature.  That will rob you of your appetite pretty quickly. I flagged down our server again and asked him to try again, which he did. But when he got back, I was essentially done with Wally's Five for today, so I didn't eat much of the burger...sorry he had to warm it up for me when I ended up leaving it on the plate..oh well...we paid for it, so:) I like the Wally's at 44th and Camelback, just fine. I was prepared to like this one, too.  I was thinking about passing on the review it because of the Cinco de Wally's thing, but...I was there, it wasn't good and I feel like Yelping!

I don't scare easily...but I'm not immune to dread:)  There are a few things that make me break out in a cold sweat:  * Circus Clowns - I mean really...who thought this was amusing in the first place?  * Any of the "reddish" colored PT Cruisers - Careening around, always filled with 90 year old snowbirds and always micro seconds away from hitting something...I just don't want it to be me:)  * Outlaw motorcycle gangs - as opposed, I guess, to non-outlaw or in-law motorcycle gangs:)  * The Maricopa County Sheriff - "Your papers are NOT in order...ve haf vay's uf makink you talk"  * Airlines that have lost the will to live - United Airlines comes to mind:(  I have a lot of miles logged with good old "Untied" Airlines...for a few years, I flew in excess of 250,000 miles per year...that's more than many of their pilots:)  And they treated me well...always in the front of the bus...free use of the Red Carpet Club...extra miles for flights...all kinds of nice stuff:)  Then I hit a milestone with UAL...a million miles!...wow...a million miles...lifetime Premier 1K status...yay!  Then UAL hit a milestone...and it hit it hard:(  All of sudden, I wasn't 1K anymore...lifetime or otherwise...I wasn't flying very much and the program that they had in place "vaporized" at some point during UAL's lean years:(...and because the service was crappy and the attitudes and pricing at UAL were worse, I pretty much quit flying them altogether.  Let's fast forward to now...I've been flying a bit more lately and found myself back on UAL a couple of times recently (hey...if a client is buying my ticket...they can put me on whichever airline they want...except for Aeroflot...the only airline that truly, I'm not even kidding, terrifies me).  UAL has really taken a tumble...I have trouble coming up with anything positive to say about them other than "we landed safely":(  I've seen cattle being trucked to the slaughterhouse treated with more respect and dignity than UAL and its employees treat their passengers:(  I didn't see any smiles or witness customer/employee interactions that were pleasant the last time I flew these guys (a couple of years ago)...it's worse now:(  It seem everyone that works for UAL is unhappy!  Polite requests for information, ETA's, ETD's are met with snarls and stony faces...inquires about seat assignments are greeted with smirks and almost open derision...there are no "pleases and thank you's" in the cabin...apparently the sole objective of the flight attendants is to keep you seated and quiet, or to collect revenue:(  On my last flight with UAL, I saw a rather substantial flight attendant (in her early 70's, I estimate) intentionally ram the drink cart into a man's ankle...his crime was dozing and having a foot in the aisle...she snarled at him to keep his feet under the seat in front...so unpleasant and so nasty:(...and so protected by federal law...the same behavior at Safeway would get her arrested for assault:(  It makes me wonder about the pilots...are they so unhappy that one of them could decide to see if a 767 can bore a hole through a mountain?...probably not...but the thought scares me just the same:(  I understand why all these folks who work for UAL are unhappy...they've all had their pensions ripped away, they have taken massive salary cuts, their dreams have been dashed (it may even be that the only people still working for UAL are people that couldn't get hired anywhere else...sadly:(  So they are not going to be giving their best...maybe they are even looking to take it out on someone...I don't know...I fly other airlines that have had financial problems (Frontier to name one) and the people you meet are all still friendly and helpful:)  And there are still good airlines around that treat you pretty well and get you where you need to go with a minimum of grimacing:)  At UAL, it seems that it has become all too easy for the airline and its employees to take out their frustrations on the passengers, so...one sad little star for the founding member of the Star Alliance:(

It was Stax for lunch today. Out on the patio (heated for our enjoyment...it was too doggone cold today..can the Scottsdale CofC do something about that please?). Our beautiful daughter Whitney is moving to Old Town Scottsdale, and she had to come over for a walk-through. She called and asked if her dear decrepit father (me!!!) was available for lunch, so we walked up to Stax. I have been here several times before and I always enjoy it. We got some totz (which is similar to a Tater Tot, but with a "z", so hipper), and sliders (a sloppy joe, a chicken, a kobe beef and a veggie). Everything was well prepared, and well timed. The service was really good (it's been a little bit uneven at times in the past, but I say "judge slowly"). They even brought a sampler of some of the aioli's to try with the totz, as well as with the sliders, no charge! Very nice touch! The only down side to Stax is that it's a little expensive for sliders, esp compared to places like Chicago Hamburger, etc.  But this place is not a hole in the wall. The atmosphere is really pleasant, Stax has a full bar so I can get a marti with my sliders, they have totz, there's room to sit down comfortably and the people watching is, as always, great. You will enjoy Stax (that's not an order, BTW, just an observation:) )

I'm in Los Reyes de la Torta!  I'm in, Los Reyes de la Torta!  No typos there my eagle eyed friends...I am happy to report that both are (in fact) correct!  Differences without a distinction!  I was reading a thread about over-hyped places the other day, on Yelp.  I wrote something pleasant, but inane and in my haste (doing four things at the same time), I misplaced a comma!  Other sharp-eyed correspondents pointed that out to me...and I'm as grateful for the unsolicited correction as I can be!  After lamenting my typo (and the very fat fingers that I use to type these little stories), I thought to myself "Donald, why not go to one of these very hyperbolically reviewed establishments and see if you can find that comma"?  After all, it has to be somewhere.  So, after a busy morning, what with working, building, producing, running, meetings, making money, special "mommy/daddy time" with the Beautiful Carin and so much more (you know..."the usual"), it was off to LRDLT for a Tuesday Retox.  I met a buddy (who has here been before and raves about this place) and I was hopeful (so very hopeful) that the place would live up to the hyperbole.  I couldn't have taken that disappointment, along with losing my comma.  I needn't have worried...the Del Rey Torta was everything I could have hoped for...and much more!  The whole menu looked terrific and I noticed that the joint was completely packed (even well before the normal lunch hour got into full swing).  Everyone in the place seemed to be happy and enjoying themselves...and why not, the food is cheap and tasty...the service is pleasant and efficient...what more could I ask of lunch?  Furthermore, the aroma coming from the kitchen was heavenly (always the first indicator, for me), so I settled in and ordered the King Torta...with a diet coke.  As my lunch friend says...Sofa King good!  And Sofa King huge...certainly the portions are large enough for a small family to share (I saw multiple examples of people sharing lunches).  But I do not share...if anybody tries to grab my victuals, they're going to hear angry growling and see bared teeth.  Especially when the grits are this good!  On a happy, sunny Tuesday morning, I found that some places really do live up to the hype.  And while it isn't Keen's Chop house, or Boulevard, LRDLT is Five Stars for what it is!  Oh, after lunch...I found my misplaced comma!  " , "  Insert it with care!

Fellow Yelpian Ryan C. organized a little luncheon at India Palace yesterday (see, it's not only ladies who lunch, sometimes it's us manly men, too:)  I made the pilgrimage from OTowSco to the near reaches of NW PHX and met up with Ryan, Rand, Norm, Daren and Wes and we talked and laughed and we hit the boofay at India Palace pretty hard:)  Pretty good boofay...not terribly extensive as far as the food selections go...but the available items were all well prepared, well seasoned and my lunch ended up on the happy end of the "Crap to Quality Ratio":)  As we dug into our first plate of boofay, Ryan said "I hope everybody filled up on bananas and cheese"...a humorous comment about lubricative effects of the food at India Palace:)  In a happy coincidence, he almost exactly described my breakfast yesterday morning...4 bananas and a  1/2 pound of Tillamook Sharp Cheddar:)  When you get to be my age, the adage "never trust a fart after 50" isn't just a funny thing to say...it becomes one of the guiding principles in your life...so, bananas and cheese...all the curry's and tandoori's  and vegetarian squash/potato stuff and vindaloo's with basmati rice and naan in the joint aren't going to break through this particular firewall:-)  Oatmeal would have just been throwing gas (no...gasoline, not GI tract methane) on the fire (oh wait...that would work too:)  Although I'm not generally a fan of boofays (I really do think the "sneeze guards" seem to be just a suggestion to many of the people that I see rooting around in the boofay) this was a pretty clean and well maintained boofay...I had 2 plates of pretty decent Indian food and got a chance to relax for few minutes with friends and have a little light conversation:)  Things stayed sealed up tight and I sailed through the rest of my day with the confidence, dignity and demeanor of a man who knows that everything is safely locked down:)

I had to make the Great Circle trip to DoPho and CenPho, although I always think of it as GoPho (going to Phoenix...it seems like a long journey). Today I got to take a baseball bat to the temple twice in one day! I had to spend quality time with my accountant and more of the same with my health insurance agent...just one of those mornings. I needed to treat myself, although after a visit with my business friends, I somehow felt it needed to be an inexpensive treat. My insurance agent is just north of Lucky Boy and that's where I went for my late lunch. I needed a scotch, and a Lucky Boy burger may not be the next best thing, but it's pretty damn good. I had not been here since last fall, but it really never changes (at least not since I came to AZ).  They just make a good, simple burger. There aren't any tricks (no butter flavored whatever on the buns). The fries are crunchy outside and fluffy inside. The buns are soft, but hold together well and the meat is charred, but not crusty and overdone. Are there better burgers in the Phoenix area?...I'd have to say yes. Are there better drive-thru burgers in Phoenix?...I don't think so.  Lucky boy is terrific...fresh, tasty, inexpensive (my meal was under $5.00), fast and the people at Lucky Boy are just extremely nice folks. Let's all do our  part and make them busier!

It's starting to get warmer, and al fresco dining is becoming, in a word, delightful! With that in mind, the Beautiful Carin and I, while we were out running a few errands today, were trying to decide what to do for lunch.  Instead of the sandwich or late Sunday breakfast option, we were close to Humble Pie and decided to stop in.  We hadn't been there in 3-4 months (one of the things I love about Yelp is that it pushes me to both try new places and revisit spots that I haven't been to in awhile). It was not busy, which was both a blessing and disquieting. There should be more people there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon!  The food is really very good, and the service was excellent (both better than the last time we were there, I think).  I don't know if I attribute that to a less crowded place, or just improvements in everything, overall. I don't know and I shouldn't over-analyze. We sat on the patio, and it is very comfortable and pleasant out there. This is a quiet corner of the Hilton Village strip mall, so it's easy to enjoy a conversation with out traffic and noise. We had a sausage and roasted fennel pizza and veggie salad. Both were terrific! I prefer a more savory than sweet pizza, generally, and this one walked the line nicely. The tomato sauce and the roasted fennel have just enough sweetness to provide a counterpoint to the salty sausage and olives. Crust has a great texture and flavor, in and of itself, and was nicely baked, with just a little blackness at the edges. Nice Job! The salad was extremely fresh and nicely dressed.  Add in decent hefevitzen and that's what I call lunch!

Carin and I met a friend at Saddle Ranch for Happy Hour (which is 1/2 price fro all drinks and appetizers) last Friday evening. You know, it's pretty good bar food (the usual nacho's, sliders, wings, etc.), but the people are so darn pleasant, from the managers to the waitresses and servers, it just moves the needle from 3 stars to 4 stars, just for the nice people!! We had a table full of food (4 appetizers for 3 people...more than enough to call "dinner" and then some!), and we all had 2-3 cocktails and the total bill came to $45. We watched a few people ride the bull, and the managers tried very hard to get the beautiful Carin and our friend to ride the bull, but it was more fun to just watch. It was also fun to watch all the pick-up types circulating (it is that kind of a place). It was our 3rd visit and we had a terrific evening, starting there and going on to a play later at 4301. I would agree with some of the posters that this is neither a fine dining nor an intimate evening type of place, but it was tasty, pleasant and lively and that's exactly what we were looking for!

It was Sunday in America, our nieces had packed up and headed back to their respective parents (fueled by a hypergolic combination of maple syrup and chocolate leftover from Easter...I have no idea how they got their little hands on all that sugar and chocolate) and the Beautiful Carin and I were, once again, free birds!  http://tinyurl.com/ca67ff  We decided a celebration was in order...we love our nieces and nephews, make no mistake (in fact, "Auntie Carin" is a family legend...the good kind) but it's always good to rev the kids up and then send them back to their mommies and daddies...kind of a practice session for when we have grandkids.  After everyone was gone, we decided a big ol' breakfast/brunchy meal was in order and since I had a Groupon for Saddle Ranch...well, you see where this is headed, don't you?  The joint was really jumpin'...I mean for a lazy Sunday in America, it was really going strong...we soon found out why..."Babes on Bulls"...adorable young ladies, in the fullest bloom of babehood were going to be riding the bull, while wearing very little in the way of clothing!  Is there a better way to spend a lazy Sunday morning/early afternoon than eating too much, having a few cocktails and watching live softcore?  I don't think so, either!  Babes on Bulls was a charity event...I have no idea what the charity was, but Carin and I donated, anyway...if only because the name of the event reminded me of the last great cinematic feature I saw...I think the movie was called "Babes on Bob"...there was a little riding going on in that movie, too!  A huge and pretty tasty breakfast of steak and eggs, hash browns, biscuits and half a six pack of Devilish Something Bloody Mary's later, I was ready for the show  And what a nice little show...Babes rode the mechanical Bull...lot's of "yee-haw's"...lots of jiggling...lots of hootin' and hollerin' from the crowd...in short, pretty much exactly what you expect when you walk into SRCH!  Sure, there are better breakfasts around...even some within my walking radius...but...SRCH is pretty decent  grub and better than average drinks and service (I mean, these people are always smiling and friendly) and ..."Babes on Bulls"...I mean come on!

Five Stars for a fast food burger chain?  Spring Break, 1974...I was a senior in college and my girlfriend, Susie, had more money than good sense (as evidenced by the fact that she was my girlfriend:)  The answer to her question "what do you want to do for spring break?" was "let's take your new car and drive to LA and party on your credit cards!!!:)"  That's where I had my first In-n-Out Burger after seeing bumper stickers and license plate frames everywhere around LA that said "In-n-Out  urge ":) So hilarious, so "in your face"...just a little bit dirty...for 1974:)  I finally asked somebody where to get such a cool and in your face bumper sticker (that'll show the man:) and I found out about In-n-Out and fell in love...no, no...not with Susie:)  I got my license plate frame... properly defaced it and for I while, I was the guy showin' the man:)  Fast forward to San Ramon, CA in 1999 and In-n-Out opens its first NorCal store 9 miles from my house, with 3 hour drive through waits, police traffic control, news helicopters and all the rest, as tens of thousands of people flooded into San Ramon to get their "In-N-Out  urge" fulfilled:)...  Pizzeria Bianco like waits to pungle up your $5 for a burger, fries and coke...whiskey tango foxtrot! (at least you can get In-n-Out to make your burger the way you want it:)  What inspires this kind of mob rush?  * Is it the cool red and white packaging, with the crossed palm trees (and little inscriptions like "John 3:16" and "Proverbs 3:5 printed in certain spots on the packaging)?  * Is it the special secret (or not so secret) menu?...The Beautiful Carin always gets her burger "Animal style, Protein Style" ...I get my burgers "mustard grilled with extra toast" and we always get the fries "Well Done":)  * Is it the simplicity of In-n-Out...they do burgers and fries...just burgers and fries...they do them pretty much any way you can think of...but they just do burgers and fries...simple and elegant:)  * Is it the quality control they exercise over their stores? They do not franchise and they do not open a store more than 1 days drive from their warehouses in LA. They make certain that the ingredients are fresh (no frozen beef) and quality standards are equally high throughout the chain.  * Is it in how they treat their employees? Everything I hear is that In-n-Out is the best fast food chain to work for, consistently paying more than MickieD's, Wendy's and the rest.  I think it's the combination of all those things...  What I do know is that they never get my order wrong, the people at In-n-Out are always happy to see me and friendly to me and the burgers and fries are always the best of any fast food chain (OK, not the best drive through burger in town...and you know who you are Lucky Boy:)   So when the "In-n-Out urge" strikes, swing through In-n-Out Burger and get yourself a 3x3, mustard grilled, extra toast, a side of fries well done, and an extra large shake...  That'll satisfy at least one of your In-n-Out urges...I can't help you with the other ones:)

I'm in  a quandary about Scratch. I walked over there for lunch today...my first time trying out Scratch. The note on the counter said "please be seated" so OK. I sat at the communal table in the middle of the room and waited...and waited...and waited. Ten minutes by my watch. Nobody behind the counter or taking food out looked at me, or acknowledged me. So, I decided I must be doing it wrong. I walked up to the counter to order and was told by the man behind the counter that "no, we wait on you" but he nicely took my order (sandwich and coke), and let me pay (BTW, I included a 20% tip up front, when I paid with my card, so I was trying to be proactive about getting good service...lesson learned) and said they would bring things out. I waited...and I waited...and I waited, while several people came in, seated themselves, were brought place mats, utensils, ice water, and their orders taken and their drink orders brought out.  I finally walked back up to the counter and asked to at least get my drink order...profuse apology from the man behind the counter, gave me a bottle of coke which turned out to be frozen solid. Another trip to the counter.  By this time you can only smile at the comedy of errors. They finally brought me a place mat and the rest (no, ice water never showed up), and then finally the sandwich. I suppose the sandwich, which was good, on good bread, well made and tasty, is the reason to give Scratch the benefit of the doubt and give them 2 stars (the service was below 1 star). The little salad they serve with the sandwich was fresh and the vinaigrette was tasty, so that was nice as well. Was it $11.00 + tip for a small sandwich good? Well, that is my quandary. I think at that kind of price point, the sandwich needs to be terrific, not just good. And, the service should at least be adequate, and it was nowhere near adequate. So, 2 stars for now, and maybe I will go back and try it again in a few months.

Pearl for Happy Hour last night! The Beautiful Carin and I met our friend Cathy for drinks, small plates and sushi at Pearl last night, and we had a great time! We have been to Pearl a couple of times before, but not in the past 2-3 months, so time to review on Yelp! We sat out on the patio and had dinner the way dinner is supposed to be, we had several small plates, several different kinds of sushi and several martinis and sake bombs, and spent the better part of 3 1/2 hours doing it! The patio is the way to go at Pearl. The weather was great, the sound levels allowed for conversation, we got to people watch as the night went on (always fun to see everybody tuning up for a night on the town!). It was really a nice experience.  The service was excellent! Pearl has brought on some new serving staff that clearly know what they are doing and how to work their stations, as well as bond with customers. And, one of the owners was part of our service team last night and that shows me they are clearly working to make sure that service is good, and improving. We had several different martini's...my standard vodka marti with a twist...well prepared, ice cold...yum! Carin tried the Deja Blue, and really liked that as well as the Cherry Bombs, and Cathy did the regular Sapporo Sake bombs (don't worry, kids, we were walking not driving last night;) ). The small plates were really good...we had coconut shrimp(2), bottle rockets, fish schticks(2), gyoza, karaage (2), as well as spicy tuna rolls, fake and bake, pearl necklace and captain crunch. All of the dishes were good...some of the sushi selections were more successful than others, but that is pretty much always the case, and everything got eaten!  So, the $74 question is how much did all this gustatory excess cost? Well...that's right! $74! Pearl now has happy hour prices on a bunch of stuff all night long, and that makes happy hour into a happy night! Finally, the decor is pleasant, modern and comfortable, and we really like the girl in the pearls artwork...and not just because the girl in the artwork is the friend that we had dinner with, Cathy (yes, seriously...yes, for realz...no, I won't give you her number). Pearl is a comfortable and affordable place with friendly staff and good food. Give them a try!

Ego adveho, animadverto Stewarts tersus meus vehiculum  I started this review in Latin, because Latin was the dominant language of the day when Stewarts began the process of washing my car:)  I don't mean to be cranky about that, nor am I implying that they didn't do a good job...they did do a good job and they do a good job whenever I stop by:)  But Crikies!...They really take their time!  I stopped by recently for a car wash, got the medium....nice job!  I really don't know how they size their washes...one wash has "tire dressing"...a fancy way of saying "ArmorAll on a Rag"...another kind of "super-size me" wash has something special that they squirt on the car as it goes through the line...(I'm always suspicious of stuff that they squirt on the car...really, they could just be turning on the light and sign that says "Now Squirting Super Size Wash Stuff" and that would be all that's happening...I want to trust, but after Danny's, it's not easy:)  So it's medium size for me...I think with the medium, they are more likely to squirt the right crap on the car, plus they vacuum it all out (don't you just love to say "vacuum"...what a wonderful word!)...clean all the windows and they dry it all off and it looks shiny and bright:)  Stewart's does a very sweet job!  And they take their sweet time doing it:)  I've probably been to every flavor of car wash in the valley, and these guys are near the top for performance, in the art of washing cars (in terms of attention to detail, not boogering up my car, not being too expensive and not trying too hard to sell me greeting cards, windshield replacements and hula girl air fresheners:)  Where they are not near the top is the length of my stay with the Stewart Family...I always hope for a shorter experience, and it always feels like I'm waiting for a pie at Bianco's...really!  I've washed, dried, vacuumed, cleaned the windows and applied ArmorAll to my own car in less time than it takes these folks...really:)  But as I get old and lazy, I'd rather watch other people do the work, and I'm happy to pay for that privilege:)  I just don't want to watch it for 45 minutes (even when it isn't even busy)  Still, you'll note that I've given Stewart's Family Car wash 4 stars (and you know I don't round up...this is no 3.5 star's and I'm feeling generous).  I do swing by here when I'm in the area and have some extra time:)  They do a nice job and thorough job, they are friendly and accommodating, and (unlike Lindstroms a few blocks away), my chances of being rounded up in a Sheriff Joe immigration sweep are pretty close to zero:-)

Cute...there's really no other word that covers what you see when you walk in to the Ranch House Grill:)  There's gingham, lariats, spurs, split rails, barbed wire, saddles and all kinds of "ranchy" things in the décor.  The décor is basically what my mother probably wanted to accomplish with the ranch house that I grew up in (and maybe could have, if she'd figured out how cover up the 40 year old wall paper, the dead white linoleum floors, and hot pink appliances and kitchen sink:(  But enough about me:)  The menu here is basic, but well executed, and what more can you ask from a place that bills itself as country cookin'?...Not much in my book:)  This is the second RHG location (the first is in Page, on the way to Colorado City, I guess so you can fuel up with big food, so you have enough energy to "visit" all your wives:)  This RHG location brings that small town, big food, restaurant feel to SE Phoenix:)  Lunching with some buddies the other day...we decided to give RHG a test drive...none of us had been there before (in fact, I think lots people haven't been here...and they should be going to RHG:)  Walked in at noon, had our drinks almost before we asked (I said "almost before"...to say we had them any sooner would imply a temporal causality paradox that I don't want to deal with here...email me if you want the math:)  The menu is "robust"...not much in the "amuse bouche" section, but plenty of "steak and eggs" options.  I selected Chicken Fried Steak with double mashed potatoes...and gravy...incredible, delectable gravy!:)  RHG has a sign outside that says they have been voted "Best Chicken Fried Steak" in Phoenix, by somebody...I'm adding my vote to the total:)...It was outstanding...hand pounded round steak, sausage gravy, buttery mashed potatoes and thick toast...I haven't had CFS this good since the last time I was in Waco.  My luncheon companions had, respectively, a Patty Melt (which he said was as good as any he'd ever had...hyperbole?...sure, but he's an attorney and given to hyperbole:), and a Chili and Cheese Omelet (BTW, I'm going back just for their chili...two kinds...red beef and green pork...both homemade and both crazy good:)  The platters (that's right, I said "platters") of food arrived and we spent the next half hour wading through the food...more than plenty to eat!...a ranchers lunch in the truest sense of the word...enough food to keep you going through a long afternoon of building barb wire fence, bucking hay, herding recalcitrant bovines and mucking out the feed barn...none of which I have done since I was 15 years old...thank god!:)  It also helps, even if you're just pounding out emails and answering phones:)  Every so often, you need a lunch like this one...Mark Knopfler said it best..."if you want to run cool, you have to run on heavy, heavy fuel":)  http://tinyurl.com/y8nw3ds  The bill came to about $10 apiece and the service was 25% tip range service:)  I think RHG fits the description of "hidden gem":)...It is a gem and you really have to look for it to find it:)  It will help if you look at the intersection of Thomas and 56th Street:)

Only the best for the Beautiful Carin...that's what I tell her constantly...that's why she chose me...that's why I take her only the best places...Like Ranch House Grille:)  Surprisingly, she hadn't been to RHG with me before now, so off we went for Saturday "Lunfast" after our workout...(I was going to call it brunch, but it was Saturday and about 1:00 pm so it kind of felt like a retox lunch time thingy, but I had breakfast, so...:-)  Carin was charmed by the rustic decor and the family atmosphere at RHG (these folks are from up around Page, Arizona...this is the southern outpost of the family restaurant empire:)  She was more charmed by the food:)  I ordered up a Chili Verde Omelet (I need to digress for minute...I've always been a red chili "snob" when it comes to chili omelets...I mean who thinks Green Pork Chili on an Omelet?...well, I do...now:-)...this is really the adult version of "Green Eggs and Ham" (BTW, RHG can steal that for their menu if they want...I don't mind:)  I am astonished at how well the flavors of the rich and meaty green pork chili work with the fresh fluffy eggs in the omelet...this is what the word "sublime" was invented to describe:)  Carin continued her very healthy ways with a veggie omelet made with egg whites...although I did notice that about 20% of my omelet was "missing" when I returned from a brief visit to the clean and shiny restrooms:)  She said there was a commotion in the restaurant while I was gone, and when she turned back from gawking, part of my Lunfast omelet was missing...but I don't know...there were unexplained Chili Verde traces on her plate:-)  She said next time we go, I can get the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs and she will get the Chili Verde Omelet...maybe she'll let me share:-)

I make my living with my little silicon buddies...but I'm not a hardware guy...and I focus on certain kinds of software (hey...it's an age of specialization...waddaya gonna do?)  I got a couple of new notebooks and I needed one of my older ones (still sporty and plenty of horsepower for most things) reconfigured for darling daughter, Whitney...where to go?  I'll tell you where...Red Seven!  I got to know our Yelp Buddy Michael C., last year when we got acquainted at Old Town Tavern and he told me about his business, Red Seven...in that time I have sent him a half dozen of my buddies when they needed some computer work...and each and every one of those people have called me and thanked me profusely for the recommendation...that says something to me!  It says I'm smart enough to send in recon before I commit myself...but that's another set of stories.  In an interesting (although not ironic) twist, I had not had an opportunity to actually use Red Seven myself...until now.  They cleaned up the HDD, loaded Ubuntu and a rack of programs on this little laptop, got me a spiffy little Iomega portable drive with all the old data from the laptop (I needed to save some  things for the Beautiful Carin's new MacBook Air...I know, I know...Mac...the good part about finally having a Mac in the house is that I can legally drop by the Apple store and see if I can make the Apple "Geniuses" look like comp-u-tards...hey, I take my fun where I find it...and they are leading with their chin when they call themselves "Geniuses").  But back to Red Seven...  As a non-hardware guy, I generally do what I can and when I run up against something I can't handle, I've occasionally used Data Doctors, Geek Squad, independent consultants, friends, what have you...you know, the same as you have...  But I have never found another shop that performs as well as Red Seven...and provides the level of customer service and customer satisfaction that are, in my opinion, the biggest factors in Red Seven's growth!  I won't be using anyone else for computer service...period.  So, whether your old Dell just coughed its HDD through the side of the box...or you've discovered that 20 gig's isn't as "roomy" as you once thought it would be (when I started doing this, 5 mb of overhead was considered "an obscene waste of space")...or you need a new laptop, desktop, custom gaming box, drop by and talk with Michael...they'll figure it out and get you going!  Tell him his Old Town Tavern buddy sent you.

Before I get to review La Bocca, I need to deal with legal "fine print".  It's called "fine print" because it will make everything "fine" if you handle it correctly (you'll just have to trust me on this...I am a highly trained "businessman"). The "fine print" disclaimer for this review follows: The Beautiful Carin is the sister of Peter, one of the managers of La Bocca. As such, I receive (and, hopefully will continue to receive, as long as we both shall live...it's in our marriage vows:), "special treatment" at La Bocca. That "special treatment" includes: Great Service; Great Food; Great Conversation; Great Atmosphere...hang on...Peter says La Bocca treats everybody that way...crap, I thought I was "special". OK, weasel words out of the way, on to the review.  The Beautiful Carin and I wanted to go back to La Bocca for dinner and last night was the night! The beautiful Carin's brother, the Cordial and Talented Restaurateur, Peter greeted us with a welcoming hug (he may or may not do that for you...you'll just have to marry one of his sisters yourself and see), and we sat down. The joint was jumpin'... Friday evening in downtown Tempe always seems to have lot going on.  We had Matt as our server and he was friendly and attentive, got us drinks and some outstanding warm olives and crusty Italian bread...I could have made a meal of that alone! I didn't...I needed to build up calories for my work out this morning. Last night, I hadn't eaten anything since the  1/2 chicken and waffle at Lolo's for lunch...I was famished:) We ordered bruschetta...they have a very nice selection ranging from standard tomato/mozzarella to minced Queen Creek olives on ricotta. We had had a couple of these at the OYE last Sunday evening and they were good then and they were good last night! We had a little time as we enjoyed our wine and appetizers and sort of surveyed the room.  I was really pretty interested in whether we were getting the friends and family treatment or whether our experience was pretty typical...It seemed like the typical experience. Matt was handling 3-5 other tables, at the same time as ours, and they were all smiling and happy. It was the same story throughout the place...everybody looked like they were having a good time:) Our salads arrived...Carin had the Caprese and I had a Caesar...here's where I figured I was getting the "insider" deal. I like anchovies (I know, go figure:) and Matt asked the kitchen to put some on my salad, since they don't generally do that. I whispered my "thanks" to him, because I didn't want the other diners to become agitated that I was getting something they could never hope to get...but Matt said in a loud voice, "no, anyone who wants anchovies can have them"...another perk, dashed! We ordered 2 pizza's...the Porko (pulled pork, caramelized onions and serrano peppers...tasty and spicy) and the meat something (I don't always remember the names, but 3 meats, olives and I added serrano's to that one...yum:) Nicely done pizza's...hot and gooey cheese, fresh and high quality toppings, crispy with a just a little blackening around the edges. Plenty to eat and we had leftovers to take home! Finally, we did dessert at La Bocca last night (last time I was here, my "offsite" dessert experience, while memorable, was less than a complete success:) They make a chocolate brownie with liquid chocolate/espresso center. They put ice cream on top and drizzle it with caramel...and crack, apparently.  I was just going to have a bite...I hoovered this thing down so fast I think I embarrassed my sweet beautiful and indulgent wife (who did manage to get a bite or 2 of the dessert, but not much more). In spite of the spoon and napkins, I still looked like a 2 year old with his first soft serve chocolate ice cream cone. So, what's the upshot...Peter, I hate to say it, but even if you never work another day at La Bocca, I'm going back...often.  In the meantime, I expect some special treatment the next time I go in!  If you want special treatment, you need to go find one of Peters other marriageable sisters (he has 14 of them) and get yourself in the family...or just go in to La Bocca and tell them I sent you:) And give Peter a hug...he enjoys it...trust me;)

There is not a thing about this place that I don't like!   - I can stay in my car and listen to NPR while my car gets a nice bath!   - I can stay in my car while one of the nice youngsters wipes my car down after it gets a bath!   - I can relax, certain that no one will come up to me and tell all about the very important rock chip in the upper right hand side of my windshield that has been there for over a year and that, if it actually cracks, will allow me to have a whole new windshield installed in my 1965 Plymouth Lancer at no charge!   - The wash itself seems to be pretty gentle...it hasn't ripped any mirrors or wipers or whatnot off my car...yet.  And I don't have to interact with anyone...I don't have to smile at the 27 undocumented workers towel drying my car while simultaneously spritzing it with some additional fluids, and angling for a bigger tip (all the while shouting "Leassus!...Leassus!")  I don't have to pay $45 for a wash...$7.00 US gives me all of the above, plus an exceptionally strongly and sucksational vacuum (say it with me...vacuuuuuuuum), for those times that I'm felling especially industrious and wanting to vacuum my own car!  The only thing lacking...wait a minute, there isn't anything really lacking in Snappy Auto Spa...I only wish it were closer to my home!  I already googled Snappy Auto Spa and there isn't one near my new place in CA...I guess I'll have to drive back to Scottsdale for a wash.

It was Star Trek - The Movie, Redux that brought me here. My Lovely Daughter Whitney had the pleasure of my company at the movies, in honor (or honour, for you brits:) of my seemingly never-ending birthday celebration:) I was trying to remember if I had ever actually seen a movie here, or just walked too close during a shopping excursion and I decided that I hadn't ever actually been in the theater (or theatre for you know whom). I do like the Camelview 5, across the street, but, frankly, not so much the big brother here in The Scottsdale Fashion Square. We saw the movie on a mid-week afternoon, so the place wasn't overrun with tiny little disease carrying, mis-guided missiles:) Still, the there is just something about the place:      - Screens are kind of small      - Theater itself smells like a school bus, and not in a good way... I        think it's the ventilation from the SFS food court...      - Staff, including the concession staff just didn't seem to be having a        very good time...I suppose that's going to be true of pretty much any         movie house employee, but could you smile a little?...it would        make me feel better about the hilarious prices of your "treats":) On the plus side, Harkins popcorn has been consistently decent (and for $37 for a medium bag of the stuff, it should be lovingly coated in truffle butter...but it's not). Even though it's close to home, it not close enough to make up for the shortcomings:( I'm with Heather C... motor down the road (or better yet, ride your bike...we do:) to the AMC at Esplanade:)

I haven't done a supermarket or "grocery store" review, before now.  There are bunch of reasons for that oversight...not very good reasons, but reasons nevertheless:)  I'm lazy...I don't really see much difference between them...I don't have any good ideas for grocery store review "stories" that I clearly love to tell:)  Well, that's all over and done...I'm reviewing AJ's:)  I understand they sell groceries there...good for them!   I hope they keep at it (although they are owned by Basha's so it could be touch and go).  What I like about AJ's is the grill outside:)...and cupcakes:)  In addition to all the overpriced crap they sell inside (I swear, Lucy Ricardo is inside the store just making prices up as she goes along...the same box of Kashi Go-Lean that I can buy at Fry's for $2.95 is $4.80 at AJ's...the same friggin' box!:(...they have a grill out front that is both reasonably priced (how does $9.00 for huge  1/2 pound kobe beef burger and a drink sound?:) and really, really good!  They grill everything over an open charcoal grill and the salmon sandwiches, the burgers, the chicken sandwiches and the hot dogs are great, tasty, hot, fresh, well priced...and they are beyond sweet to me at the grill!  Queue up at the counter like I did yesterday and get yourself one of their incredible grilled salmon sandwiches...it looked like an entire salmon swam onto the toasted bun.  All the condiments are right there for the taking...so don't be stingy with whatever you like on your sandwich...don't see it?...Just ask and they will head into the store and get it for you:)  Then sit outside, in the shade, under the misters and enjoy one of the best, most reasonably priced lunches you will have!  After lunch, remembering what my buddy, Abu J. said about the bakery at AJ's, I headed into the store for my sweet treat:)  A revelation!  First of all...Thanks for the tip, Abu!  Second of all, Sprinkles should buy their cupcakes from AJ's and resell them...they could still charge their $14 per cupped cake and the cupped cake would actually be good...everybody would be happy:)  I bought a vanilla cupped cake with vanilla frosting (so subtle, but so satisfying:)...so much better than several of the cupped cake boutiques around town and really, on a par with some of the best...maybe not quite as good as Tammy Coe, but then I only paid $1.45 for this little gem...that ratio of price to goodness hunts!  Next time you are up in the north country, swing by AJ's and say "hi" to Stefanie and the people behind the grill at AJ's and do yourself a favor...leave room for a cupped cake...you'll be happy you did:)

As I reach that certain point in my life, I don't ask for too many things:  * Shoes that fit - my running shoes seem to be pinching my toes after 4-5 miles these days...I don't know why and it makes me a little cranky by mile 6...but not cranky enough to buy new shoes...I'd be crankier if I didn't "get all the good" out of my shoes..."sigh"  * Enough sleep - Talk about cranky...they say the average person sleeps about 16 hours a day and that's the exact amount of sleep that I need to make sure I'm fresh, rejuvenated, revitalized and ready for action  * A clean, warm, well lit place to...well, get some of the sundries that I need for my life (and have the occasional celebrity sighting)...this Target covers the bases:)  The Beautiful Carin and I were out yesterday running some errands, doing a little business, having a little lunch, doing a couple of good deeds, helping out a good cause...you would not believe the number of restaurants we visited yesterday...5...5...Yup...5!  In between gorging on chili omelets, lettuce wraps, Thai food, martini's, shrimp, martini's, etc. (OK, maybe that was just me...Carin shows remarkable restraint:), we needed to pick up a few things for the house and Carin suggested Target, so we made the circle around to whatever they call that shopping thingy at Indian Bend and the 101 (these shopping dealies all have names, I know, but really, except for the developers and owners, who remembers what those names are?...not me:-)  As we walked in, the first thing I said was "How you doin', Kurt?" to Kurt Warner who was grabbing the bright red shopping cart next to the one I was grabbing...he had about 6 kids hanging off of him and was still nice enough to say "How you doin'?" back...not "How you doin', Donald"...but nevertheless:)  We headed off to find some Easter crap (decorations, plastic eggs, chocolate and what not) and a couple of other household items I was told we need...I don't know...all I know is that we didn't get me new running shoes, so my toes still pinched during my run this morning:(  Carin treats Target like the bazaar at a desert oasis...she has the soul of a Jordanian rug merchant...we got to the checkout counter and she started haggling with the nice lady at the checkout counter..."did you see that this is a little frayed?"..."can you see that box has a little dent in it?"...how much can I get off the price because the merchandise is "damaged"?  20%...that's how much!  I was astonished when the nice lady at the cash register called a manager over after Carin started her spiel...I thought "well, I've been thrown out of nicer places than this"...but no, the manager examined the items and gave Carin a big smile and said "20% off":-)  I always just shut up and pay what the sticker says...but no more...I'm letting Carin do the negotiating for me on everything from here on out!  At least she can do the bargaining for us at this 4 star Target (4 solid red Yelp stars for the clean, well stocked, user friendly, celebrity packed store).  I bet Kurt just paid what the sticker said on his stuff when he left...although I imagine he can afford it:)

The Beautiful Carin and I stayed at the Trump and on one of our nights in Las Vegas, we decided to eat at DJT, the hotel restaurant (I know those initials must stand for something...what could it be...Dow Jones Tremors?...I don't know...Oh Wait, before I forget, Donald J Trump is the proprietor so that could be the origin). DJT was pretty good. They have a nice selection of single malts and I started dinner with one of my favorites, Bunnahabhain...not many places seem to have it. We didn't order anything too terribly interesting...Carin had a wild greens salad and I had and crab bisque to start. I had a veal chop (no angry letters please...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch and I just think "yum" when I think of calves), and Carin had a roasted chicken. No dessert here...we went to the Carnegie Deli for a disappointing cheesecake...oh well. The entree's were well prepared and nicely presented. Sometimes I think the essence of fine dining is simple food, well prepared and tasty, presented nicely in delightful surroundings, and DJT does a good job of that. The service was very good, and everyone in the restaurant seemed anxious to please, going out of their way to say "hello", and smile.  The decor is in keeping with the rest of the hotel...elegant in a "Trumpulescent" way. It was an expensive evening (2 scotches were $50, so you can guess the rest), and for those prices, they have to be extraordinary to get to 5 stars, and it was nice, but not orgasmic.

I had lunch with a friend yesterday at PCG (Phoenix City Grill) and decided a little sweet treat was in order after lunch. Sweet Republic is right on the way from PCG to my home in Old Town (I'll leave it to you to do the triangulation on that one...GPS says it was right on the way and that's close enough for me...you disobey our silicon masters at your own peril!). As I have mentioned before, I am a "Trendinista". I follow the herd because the herd knows what it knows...sometimes what it knows is good!  I followed the herd into the Sweet Republic, got my passport stamped and obtained my extended stay visa. I know, it's just ice cream, right? Right? Well, it's just really good ice cream.  I had the vanilla bean (the Bentley of ice creams) and I want more of it, lot's more of it. The vanilla is real vanilla, hand scraped out of the bean by one of the governors of the Republic. The government of the Republic makes its ice cream fresh every day and you really can taste the difference (I also tried the salted butter caramel and the flavors really do come together so nicely!). The government of the Sweet Republic does not have a weapons program or a roads and infrastructure program...for all I know, it might not even be a real government...Maybe that's their genius...a shadow government based on sugar, eggs, milk and flavorings!  They may be the only ones I can trust with my ideas around the creation of a federal bacon filled doughnut program...although it might turn into bacon ice cream, now that I am a regular visitor to the Republic of Sweet!

I am a fan...and because of that, I stop pretty frequently...I'd say more than 50% of the time that I motor north into the Great Shining Beacon on the side of McDowell Mt. and Pinnacle Peak called "North Scottsdale", I stop off for cup or a cone!  The ice cream is made with love and craftsmanship that surpasses that of most of the restaurants in the Greater Phoenix area...I really do love their Madagascar Vanilla Bean ice cream!  Wonderful, delightful sweet treats...just about the best ice cream that I've ever had (and that includes the homemade frozen custard that I used to make...and I will tell you that nobody appreciates my own cooking more than I do!).  So, Donald, why only 4 stars for the Republic?  Is it just me?  Am I xenophobic?...have something against ice cream based governmental systems?...maybe a lactose intolerance based grudge against the Republic and those for which it stands?  No...no...I just want a smile out of somebody when I buy a cup or a cone and then maybe spend another $20-30 to take a little frozen delight home to the Beautiful Carin...I've been in this place 20 times or more and I never get more than a "next" out of the people dishing out the scoops!  Or a hurried "will that be all?" when they are ready for me to be done and pay and get going...  I try to chat...even stuff like "how's your day?" and "boy, that looks great!" is met with silence.  Maybe it's just me...  Last week, I dropped by on my way home from a visit with one of my attorneys (and you can believe me when I say I really needed a treat).  It wasn't a busy afternoon...but again...I was greeted with...indifference.  There was a sign in the window advertising for help...wanting people "passionate" about being there...OK, I see the passion in the ice cream...and the customer service isn't bad...not really...they always get to me eventually and I get what I want...but I couldn't say that anyone behind the counter has ever smiled at me...chatted with me...even when taking my money...sometimes quite a bit of money...it's a little bit disconcerting...  Oh well, the ice cream here is the star of the show and I do like the ice cream!  Oh, and a smile and chat would be nice, too!

After Yelp Office Hours on Tuesday (Thanks Again Gabi! :-), Mr. K, Brian S and I decided that we needed lunch...were to go?...were...to...go?  We were sort of in the neighborhood of Al-Hana, (OK, not really, but close enough) and it won out over some of the other suggestions...and I'm glad it did:)  We all like discovering new places and this little spot takes some discovering:)  If you don't know that it's inside Baiz market, you will never discover Al-Hana...and that would be a shame:)  Much like the cafe at Ranch Market (just up the street) this little cafe is a genuine delight embedded in this small grocery market (with, apparently, no end of interesting food items and sundries in its aisles:)  One of the more interesting things I noted, during our visit, was the sizable inventory of hookah's, under lock and key, in the front of the store:)  They must have 50 of these things in stock!  I'm not a hookah marketing expert, but if asked about inventory management of hookah's, I would have said "hold on there, Earl, I think 3 or 4 hookah's in stock is plenty" :-)  So, imagine my surprise and delight, when, during a one hour lunch, I saw 2 of these water pipes walk out the door, accompanied by all sorts of tobacco cans, and other paraphenalia:)  And, these hookah's aren't cheap...sticker price looks to be around $200 for the low end models (I really can't tell high end from low end, with hookah's...I'm just going with size as the differentiator:-)  What is cheap at Al-Hana/Baiz is lunch...cheap and delightful:)  I had Chicken Shawarma and fries (I know...intriguing combo:)...quite tasty:)  I got a chance to sample Brian's Hummus and Babaghannuj and I looked over the menu for future visits...because there will be future visits:)  The menu includes kabob's, whole roasted chickens, delightful little meat pies ($.69 each...wow!:), and whole host of middle eastern delights...and fries:)  And last, but not least, the staff at Al-Hana is so friendly, smiling and eager to please:)  It's a stark contrast to the places that think it's enough to just take your order and toss your food at you...the nice people that took care of me just didn't stop smiling the entire time I was there...and I didn't even have spinach in my teeth...this time:)  Half-way between Roosevelt and Van Buren on 20th St.  It's worth making the trip:)

I have now been to both of the places named Dickeys in the greater Phoenix area.  One, Dickies Dogs out in North Scottsdale would occasionally get my retox business, when we lived out that way...they were close to DC Ranch and close to the DC Ranch Village, so it made getting a hot dog easy enough:)  Then people started throwing dynamite through the windows of Dickies Dogs in the middle of the night in a misguided attempt at extreme restaurant critiquing:)  I quit going to Dickies Dogs when the possibility of getting fragged reared its ugly head!  I'm thinking the guerilla critic might have been guilty of a case of mistaken identity (as well as multiple Class A federal felonies:(  While Dickies Dogs made serviceable hot dogs, you really can't say the same about the "barbecue" from Dickeys Pit.  I met a friend at Dickeys Pit yesterday for lunch and a business meeting...from the moment I walked in, I just sort of knew it was not going to go well for Dickeys Pit:(  I took a look at the somewhat limited menu, while I sniffed in vain for the slightest hint of wood smoke in the air.  Then I read their menu more closely.  When they talk about how they make their "barbecue" at Dickeys, they talk about how they "cook" their meats "on the pit" overnight...wait a minute...that's not barbecue!  I walked around to the side of the counter and saw the stainless steel "pit", over which they "cook" the meat...oh crap?!?!?  At any rate, I was there and I was starving (power yoga and no breakfast make for an empty boy:) so I went ahead and ordered the pulled pork sandwich with "barbecue" beans.  They brought out my sandwich, which had been "cooked on the pit"...sliced pork shoulder (not pulled pork) without so much as a hint of smoke, served with watery beans that had more in common with bean soup than with real barbecue beans...except without the flavor of good bean soup:(  They have serve yourself barbecue sauce and I got regular and spicy sauce (the sweet sauce was almost like candy:(...and I slathered the spicy on my sandwich in an unsuccessful effort to get some flavor into the meat.  It was just a sliced pork sandwich with second rate barbecue sauce poured over the top...it wasn't barbecue, pit or otherwise and it wasn't good:(  The place is clean, modern, family friendly, pretty cheap and completely without redeeming value when it comes to the food they serve.  I think the mysterious Mad Dickies Bomber might just have had the wrong Dickeys!

I went to April Office hours at Drip on Thursday and really enjoyed getting to know some of the people that populate the Yelp community.  One of the things I like about Yelp is that people actually get together to talk about food, culture, art, etc.  I spend way too much of my life with my head buried in a monitor, dealing with electro-mail and what not:) So, given the crowd at Office Hours, it probably isn't incredibly surprising that after Office Hours, we decided that we had better get something to eat...I need my 7 square meals a day or I get cranky...low blood sugar:) I set out for Sabor Cubano, with Mr. K and Brian S. (as agreeable a pair of lunch companions as there are:). I had never been to Cuban Flavor, although I am big fan of Cuban food (and cuban cigars, but no,no,no,no, I don't smoke them no more...I've been following Jim W's song title thread:).  I like Havana Café (a review for another day), but I had not had some of the "down home" or "en casa" Cuban food that we got at Sabor Cubano. I can take or leave buffets, as general rule (I think "sneeze guard" is just a suggestion, in the buffet line, frankly...I have seen far too many people with their head under the Plexiglas, trying to get that last pickle or radish to be comfortable that it keeps much in the way of disease out of the food:).  For you non-buffet types, Sabor Cubano has table service, Cuban specials (sandwiches, beef dishes, etc.). But "danger" is my middle name and the lunch buffet was truly delightful.  I got to sample so many cubano dishes that I hadn't tried before.  They had navy beans and ham, with giant ham hocks sitting in the beans in the hot table...delightful:) ; they had 3 different types of chicken on the bone, all seasoned and prepared differently and all delicious. There were spicy black beans and red beans, several different kinds of rice, potatoes that really complemented one of the chicken dishes. Chicken Croquettes, Beef, fish, and vegetables and soup, all cooked in a Cuban style completed the hot offerings. Everything was well prepared, and nothing was dried out and tired (something you see in buffets on a pretty constant basis). The salad bar was clean and the vegetables fresh, and the desert bar had custard and a rice pudding that looked great and authentic (I didn't have desert...I am trying to watch my figure:) A very solid offering for under $10, including drinks. It didn't hurt that we had some great conversation and few laughs during lunch, too!  Sabor Cubano stays in the rotation:) Brian and Mr. K, thanks again for pointing me south to Cuba! (or was it northwest?).

I haven't gotten baked in many years...I can't afford the calories or the loss of cognitive function any longer...there is just no more margin for error!  But there was this movie playing on the flat panel right above me...and it made me feel like I had gone down the rabbit hole one more time!  The movie was about this Indian girl and her well meaning but "excitable" brothers...what a bunch of goofballs!  They seemed to be stoned, too!  And there was an Indian Nobleman (a Rajah?) who was sort of interested in the girl and rode a white horse through her living room!  And there was lots of wrestling and tickling and witty banter between the brothers and the sister ("bunny, what do you keep in your hat?...brains?!?!")  I felt like I had gone back 35 years, rolled a fattie of Oregon's Finest (and I can vouch for the fact that it was extraordinarily fine) and was sitting around watching a normal evening at the Kwik-e-Mart in Sweet Home!  Just takin' it all in, man...abiding...  I was mesmerized and charmed by this incomprehensible Bollywood spectacle as I had my chicken korma lunch special (the buffet is gone...lunch specials are the new reality...the "altered" reality).  Tasty, tasty stuff, with garlic naan, raita and an assortment of chutney's, with the heat ramped up to "11" for me, making for a very entertaining and pleasant lunch.  If they had a black light in there and maybe a little more sitar, Taj would have really blown my mind, man!  Or if had just gotten toasted before lunch:-)

I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)  I hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-I  But I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)  And, I like taco's:)  And I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer "My Day", sadly:(  But I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(  I got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)  I didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)  Those are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably "taco de playa" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)  10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)  No beach at 5th and Camelback:(  But, I digress:)  I liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)  I really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's "outrageous" in any sense of the word:)  Although nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.  So I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!  Hey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...  That would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)  But no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(  In Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(  There are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)

I had not been to Yelp event yet, but if the rest of the events are anywhere close to this, I will definitely get to all of them that I can! The Beautiful Carin and I got there about 5:45 and things were just heating up. We met Gabi and Jared, and Gabi was great! She made us feel very welcome, and introduced to some of the people there, and the conversations began. The venue was terrific, the people we met were universally nice, and the conversations really were a lot of fun...talking about food, restaurants, music, etc. Just a great time...We were sorry when we had to leave to walk our dog (not a euphemism). Thanks again Gabi and Yelp!

I had never, ever been recognized because of Yelp...until a few days ago!  I was frankly concerned that the first time someone recognized me because of Yelp, it would be in connection with one of my less "flattering" reviews.  And I take very seriously, the old adage "never mess with people that prepare and handle your food"!  So I was surprised and delighted (and more than little relieved) that my "first time" was with Jennifer, at this Paradise Bakery outpost!  Jennifer was sweet and friendly, she was even complimentary about my humble attempts to create interesting reviews!  I not only appreciate her reading my little stories, I really appreciated her saying "Hi"!  The Beautiful Carin and I used to frequent this PB when we lived in Scottsdale Mountain, but I hadn't been here in some time.  We would have a croissant or a muffin and drink refill after refill of PB's very good coffee, read our Sunday papers and plot and plan the week ahead.  It was and is a great spot to just hang out!  One of my clients suggested it as a place to meet...and since they have pretty decent baked goodies, good coffee, free wifi and, of course, Jennifer (and a lot of nice people like Jennifer helping you at PB), I said "why not".  Have you noticed that almost no one (including me, BTW) meets at their offices anymore...or at least rarely?  Out of 8 client meetings in Phoenix this week, 3 were at an office...the rest took place at a coffee shop, or a restaurant, or on a park bench late at night (OK, I'm kidding about that last one...probably).  This location is my favorite of all the PB's (and judging from my PB Frequent Flyer Card, I have clearly been to nearly all of them, so I think I'm qualified to judge).  Drop by, grab a Lemon Poppyseed Muffin (unless you have a drug test scheduled for later in the day), a bottomless cup of coffee, fire up the iPad and make this place your office away from the office.  And say "Hi" to my new friend, Jennifer!

For those of you who don't follow me on Twitter (which will, in the not too distant future, probably be mandatory...we must all follow each other...the snake will eat its own tail:), I'm on a  nearly constant quest to find the best burgers!  I wander far and wide (generally wider, as opposed to farther:)  My search took me the exotic clime's of Near North Scottsdale at Shea Boulevard and Scottsdale Road.  I guess, truth be told, it wasn't so much a search this time, as it was convenient to BevMo...The Beautiful Carin and I were restocking some of our bar...they don't sell Bunnahabhain and 21 year old Glenlivet at Costco:)  And there it was, Indulge Burgers and More...beckoning through the exhaust haze in the parking lot.  This seems to be the "and More" strip mall..."Beverages and More"..."Indulge Burgers and More"..."Pet Market and More"..."Chase Bank and More"...you get the idea:)  My question (and I always have one:) is "more what"?  My personal preference would be for "more cowbell"...how I miss Blue Oyster Cult! :-)  We stashed our little liquid treasures in the trunk (taking extra care not to bruise the scotch:) and walked in.  Indulge's strong suit is not atmosphere...it's a nice enough space, nicely decorated, clean and bright, but it's in that little strip mall at Shea and Scottsdale...not a great spot to sit out on the patio and watch the world go by, while you enjoy your burger.  And you probably will enjoy your burger...Indulge has some pretty decent burgers:)  They have a "set menu" as well as the oh so au courant "build your own burger" menu for your dining pleasure:)  Our server was sweet as pie and took the time to explain what was included, what was optional (pretty much everything, as near as I could tell) and how the process works:)  We decided to create our own burgers...Angus Beef for me and grilled chicken for Carin.  You can add more toppings than a normal bun could possibly hold and make yourself one of those freakish Food Network "Worlds Best Burger" competition kind of things (you know what I mean...Frisbee size patty,  1/2 pound of bacon and gorgonzola, apricots, arugula, avocado, cactus, sprouts, peppers, carrots...well, the list goes on and on and on:)  Another words, enough other crap to completely kill the taste of the burger, if that's your aim:)  But why would you?  These are pretty decent burgers all by themselves...1/3 or 2/3 lbs. of great angus beef (I was born and raised on a cattle ranch and we raised...that's right, black angus cattle...delicious black angus cattle...so I've always had a bias for angus beef:)  Cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and pickles are all you really need, and they are fresh and included with your burger:)  Add in fries and onion strings and I'm usually a pretty happy camper.  Best burger or chicken sandwich in town?...Best Patio?...Best Ambience or Service?  No, unfortunately...but better than most and probably deserving of the title "Best Upscale Burger Joint Next to Where I Buy my Booze"  That's good enough to make me stop when I'm at the crossroads and restocking the bar:)

I made a solemn promise to my Yelp buddy, lain b., that I would give Franks Alot a try this week...well, it wasn't so much a solemn promise as more of a "if I happen to be in the neighborhood at lunchtime I will try to get by"...happily for me, it all worked out today:)  I had the traditional Power Yoga class at the Village today (the class was brutal today...with a capital "BRU"... but I toughed it out:)  After class, I needed something...something...what can retox your system any better than that big dose of unidentifiable beef parts that are first ground into a slurry and then soaked in nitrates that I like to call a "Vienna All Beef Wiener":)???  Almost nothing, that's what (with the possible exception of unblended, 24 year old, highland malt scotch whiskey...but I am still working this afternoon...so hot dog it is:)  I motored down 40th, past LGO, I saw the Chicago Hamburger sign beckoning off to my right, all wanting my business, all tasty and singing to me as I passed by, but I pressed on to my goal!  I was almost on the runways at Sky Harbor before I finally found this place...it's a long way down 40th:)  I don't get to this part of town very often...not really much for me to do here, but even though it's a schlep, I can see it becoming a hot dog destination.  From first glance, you can tell that Franks Alot is a hot dog joint...drive through or walk up...cash only sign...no inside seating (although it was nice eating on the covered patio with the misters going and classic rock over the acoustically impaired speakers...made me feel like I was 17 again and sitting outside at Luke's in Monmouth...right down to "Spirit in Sky" warbling away at me:)  I gotta agree with lain...Franks Alot makes a good hot dog!  I had 2 foot longs, just to see what these wieners are made of (oh wait...I remember now...beef parts slurry, etc...see above:)  They steam the Vienna All Beef Wieners (I just like writing wiener as often as possible:), serve them in warm fluffy poppy seed buns (I don't have to worry about the drug tests...drug use is encouraged for software developers:)...they have celery salt to sprinkle on your wiener (insert joke here:) which is almost always worth a star!  They've got a lot (probably where the name comes from) of different sausages at Franks Alot...the special today was a polish sausage, and they have brats, red hots, etc.  They do chili dogs, Chicago style, bacon wrapped...you know...all the healthy options:)  I might even try one of those variations one of these days.  But for now, I'm happy with the good old standby...the foot long hot dogs!  $8.55 for 2 foot longs and barrel of diet coke...that's more than $3.00 less than Ted's for the same thing...and I didn't have to wait in line for 45 minutes:)

The Beautiful Carin invited me to accompany her to church this morning after power yoga at the Village...how could I say no? :-)  I am her "arm candy" in those kinds of social situations...and in fact, I cannot cross over the transom of the church, unless we are holding hands...I have an unfortunate tendency to spontaneously combust when I try to enter a church on my own:)  But we held hands and I safely navigated the inner sanctums of Scottsdale Bible Church this morning:)  But, I didn't get a chance to retox immediately after my workout and running on nothing but coffee, I was starving by the time the preacher said "Amen, Go forth", etc.  We were looking for someplace kind of close to the house, with a varied menu (we took Carin's mom, the Lovely Lynn, out for lunch after church today, so we were looking for a bit more than chicken and waffles:)  I suggested we give Daily Dose another go.  Carin had not been here before, nor had Lynn, so there we were:)  We were met at the door by the owner, Jenn-Lyn (also of Fusion, although she informed me that they closed Fusion a few weeks ago...sadly:(...but, on a positive note, the closing of Fusion seems to have allowed them to focus on DD, because, the everything is much better than the last time I was there, and they were quite busy:)  Drinks and menus' arrived right away, the service was friendly and accommodating and Carin and her mom were just delighted with the menu selections, the service and the ambiance of the place, and I agree...it's a pleasant spot:)  I decided to try something other than a burger today and am I glad that I did:)  I had a sandwich called the "Old Town Stack...shaved prime rib, gruyere cheese and red cabbage slaw on the sandwich...inventive and very tasty!  Carin and Lynn had the Chopped Southwestern Salad and the Spinach Citrus Salad, respectively...they pronounced the salads delicious and the salads were also huge (we ended up taking  1/2 of each home).  They made my girls happy, and I am here to tell you, if your wife and mother-in-law are happy, you are going to be happy:)  I love getting the chance to give another star to nice people for real improvement!  The DD is a solid 4 stars and solidly in the Old Town rotation:)

I had a business meeting a few days ago...OK, it was over a week ago (I am just now catching up on my yelping...I make it sound like a commitment, but really...it's entertaining to write about food, events, hotels and all the rest of the yelp worthy universe as opposed to writing about money, marketing, software, money, technology, legal issues, money and mostly...money:) We selected Press Coffee as the rendezvous. I had not been there (and in fact, I hadn't made the right turn off the 101 to swing by City North). Press Coffee is a very nice coffee house/wine bar.  They serve a decent cup of coffee, have nice selection of breakfast pastries and breakfast food goodies.  They seem to have a reasonable wine selection, and the menu to complement the wines (much, I suppose like Sportsman's, but frankly not as extensive a wine selection). The atmosphere is also really pleasant...open, airy and comfortable inside with a huge patio (where we had our coffee) outside. It looks like they have a number of events at Press, to generate some traffic...and Press needs traffic! As pleasant as Press is, when I walked in at 7:00 am, I was the only person in the place...in fact, until my associate showed up, I may have been the only person (other than the guy behind the counter) moving in City North. We sat outside on the patio by the front door for nearly 2 hours and saw maybe 10 people go into Press...that can't be good! In all candor, I haven't been there in the evening and maybe the joint jumps at night. But, it doesn't seem like a lot of people live there and it really doesn't seem like a destination (about 5 stores all selling women's clothing or shoes, as near as I could tell...along with a couple of restaurants that are open and a few places that are "under construction"...with nobody actually constructing). Although Press makes a good cup of coffee and they have a wine bar, it frankly won't be in my regular rotation. It's a long way out there and even if I'm in the neighborhood, there are more shops, restaurants, coffee shops, wine bars and the rest 2 miles in either direction at Desert Ridge or Keirland, so there isn't much reason to take the 56th St. exit. Sadly.

What a great little bar! I had not been there since it was J Chew, but our dear yelperrific friend Michael C is now behind the bar every Tuesday evening. I am so happy I wandered over last night to congratulate Michael and add to the tip jar:) What a great hobby!  As j Chew, this place was a nice little bar-bar (let's just go have a cocktail, no small plates, nothing like that, just a good pour of good liquor...yay!:), but it's frankly even better in this incarnation!  Comfortable as an old shoe (but smelling considerably better), and as friendly as new puppy (but, again, smelling considerably better:).  I am so happy, that I am moved to write a haiku about the experience (with a nod to Abu J who is inspiring me to get in touch with my inner poet:)  Glenlivet arrives then, happily do I drink Refill please, Brackin's  I'll see you there (I'm the one on the 3rd stool from the left:)

Life is short and very unpredictable...that point was brought home with devastating suddenness this morning when I got a text that one of my squash buddies had a heart attack and passed away while playing the sport he truly enjoyed...with people that he liked...at a time of his life when things were getting a little easier...you know...my time of life.  As several of my friends opined...there are worse ways to go than keeling over while you're in the middle of playing a sport that you get a kick out of...there are also better ways to go...I personally anticipate an orgasm that will end my life at the ripe old age of 149...Carin said she'd better be there.  At any rate, a bunch of us needed to get together and celebrate Don's life and commiserate with each other over his passing...we couldn't think of better place to do that than Old Town Tavern.  When this place was called Brackin's, it set the bar pretty high for what a "neighborhood hangout bar" should be...the delightful people that run OTT haven't fallen back an inch...in fact, they have managed to improve on something that I thought was nearly perfect (I mean, what else could have inspired me to write a haiku about a bar?).  OTT is a wonderful little spot to sit, have a cocktail or six and watch the world go by, whether you sit inside and solve problems with the bartenders or view the world from below (on the lower deck) or gaze down over your empire from the upper deck...you will not go wrong by bringing your joys and sorrows, your victories and defeats, your highs and your lows to Old Town Tavern.  And though the reason for getting together to hang out at OTT was sad, our good friends Whiskey, Vodka, Gin and Tequila helped us all to tell our stories about Don...funny ones, happy ones, interesting ones...and let us celebrate the life of our friend in the best way we know how.  Thanks for being there for us Old Town Tavern...Requiscat in Pace, Don

I had the beginning stages of my bi-annual physical this morning...after the good doctor (and he is a good doctor...some of the best doctor jokes I've ever heard:) was finished prodding, poking and invasively examining me, I set my Yelp for 'droid on "healthy eating"...the app thought I said "hot doggies" and took me to Famous Uncle Al's (hey, when a computer (no matter how small that computer is) tells you do something, you had better do it:)  I am trying now to figure how to rate it...3 Stars?...4 Stars?...Pi Stars? (with apologies to Brian S for the blatant theft of "Pi Stars":-)  I don't know...this is a hot dog joint and there are rules...and Famous Uncle Al (not his real name, BTW) breaks nearly all of the rules!  Lets take a look at the Rules of Hot Dog Joints, shall we:)   - Crappy linoleum floors and counters, accompanied by a "kitchen" in severe need of a degreasing - Not available at FUA:)  I swear, I have never seen a cleaner, brighter hot dog joint in my life...you could eat off the floor (or really, pretty much any horizontal surface) in here...the place is just kept in pristine condition:)   - A cook who's seen better days and a little bit of attitude from the "help" - Also, sadly, unavailable at FUA:)  The little family that owns and operates this franchise greeted me at the door, asked me to sit at one of their lovely clean tables, anywhere I wanted to sit and then waited on me at that table...what a novel concept...service with a smile:)   - Crappy, wobbly little tables and a dingy, torn wallpaper motif (with the optional, but ever so popular, "No Pest Strip" dangling from the ceiling)? - Nothing remotely like that going on here:)  FUA is open and bright, airy and nicely decorated...they have a nice big LCD TV set on ESPN, or the news or something like that...so I don't have to watch "Lost" reruns on my phone while lunching solo:)   - Hot Dogs and buns from the "what we didn't sell last week" bin, served for your pleasure from a grease and water bath - Again, just not how they do things at FUA:)  These dogs are alright...certainly on a par with any other decent hot dog joint and better than most:)  They serve their variety of dogs in a variety of ways...if you don't see it on the menu as one of their standards, just ask:)...want a brat with mustard, celery salt, relish, red onion sauce and shredded (not melted) cheese?...they are only too happy to accommodate (and for not a lot of cash, either:)   - The last rule they break is a doozy, though...hot dog joints are always little and underfunded...a hand to mouth existence for all but a fortunate few - not FUA...a public company traded under the symbol "FDOG.OB"...fdog?...really?...OK:)  2 dogs, w/shredded cheese, and a large beverage set me back a cool $9.10 today...for a couple of very good dogs...hey, my physical was arduous...I needed the boost at lunch:)  I didn't even have to stand in line for it:)

I would say 4 1/2 stars, but as you may know, I don't round up. Well, we finally made it back to The BJ (Breakfast Joynt)...right after the March Yelp event at the BJ as promised...well, pretty close to right after the March event at the BJ. Okay, it's pretty much 1  1/2 months later, and we hadn't been back "up north" at breakfast time.  As those of you who have ever read (or "scanned") my "reviews" (or scribblings') have surmised, I could almost be classified as "recluse" in my Yelp Personality Profile (you all filled yours out, didn't you?). I just don't get out much! So it was with some trepidation that I emerged into the sunlight this past Sunday to run a few errands, get a workout, have a little breakfast and then have a little family time.  Did I say breakfast?  Why yes I did.  After a workout that I can only describe as "heroic", we were back in the car and headed home. Once again, according to GPS, someplace in the northern reaches of Scottsdale was right on my way from the Camelback Corridor (or "CaCo") to my home in Old Town Scottsdale (what is finally going to work here...OSco...OTS...OTSco...OTowSco...I just don't know:). I have to get that GPS fixed...but it did take me to the BJ for breakfast.  It was nice to get back! We got there and they were pretty busy, but we were seated within about 5 minutes of arriving.  Our server was a little bit discombobulated...lot's going on and part of the shift had been sent home, and then they got slammed! But she was sweet and going a hundred miles an hour and since we weren't in any particular hurry, that was not a problem. I love breakfast...OK, I pretty much love all food, but I really love breakfast and the BJ doesn't disappoint (when has the BJ ever disappointed:). Let's get back to biscuits and gravy...is what I said to our server. I also had the fresh OJ...tasting like it was being squeezed into my glass directly from the orange:)...I had tasted both items at the Yelp event and they are still terrific! The BJ does a real nice job with sausage gravy (and as you know, there isn't any food that gravy can't improve:) The Beautiful Carin had an egg white vegetarian omelet that she really enjoyed, and we split a side of ham (ham is a vegetable, right?:).  Even the coffee was really good! I'm not saying it's D'Lish or Pascucci good, but good, straight ahead breakfast shop coffee:) David, the owner came out and said "hi" and we said "hi", and...OK, enough verbatim conversation, but it was nice of him to say hello and tell us how much he appreciated the Yelp event and our returning on our own...nice guy! Since we were in the near reaches of the great northern desert known as NoSco, we had dessert (dessert after breakfast...nice concept:) across the border in the Republic of Sweet...The BJ and ice cream...it just doesn't get better than that:) The BJ is one of the best breakfast places in town and not nearly crowded enough...yet. So, get on up to the near far north and add gravy to your life...your cardiologist won't be happy, but you'll thank me:)

I was going to cook last night, and I probably should have. When the beautiful Carin got home though, I heard myself saying "let's go do a happy hour someplace". We decided that walking distance was the right answer so we headed out into OTowSco (trademarked, first usage on March 18, 2009, pronounced "oh-tow-skoh", an alliteration consisting of the shortening of the phrase Old Town Scottsdale...I saw the amusing discussion about the origins of DoPho, NoPho, CenPho, etc. and I wanted to be the first, possibly the last and probably the only person to use OTowSco, but certainly...I want the credit!). The someplace turned out to be American Junkie. We went there a few times when it was the Tequila Grill and it was pretty decent then, so we thought we would give this place a try (some good reviews on Yelp, but apparently for the club part of the equation). As long as I'm making up words, how about "sadapointing" (I could also add craptacular, and couple of others, but I didn't make those words up). I don't like giving 1 star reviews, but these guys deserve it...truly! The trouble started right away. We walked in and they didn't seem to be very busy for a happy hour, but no one greeted us. 2 of the owner or managers were sitting right near the door when we walked but didn't so much as smile at us. The server had a party of 10 or so, and 2-3 parties of 2-4 people, but she was the only server in the place. I finally asked the bartender if we could sit anywhere and he grunted "yes". 5 minutes pass and finally the server comes by to bring menus and take our drink order. The beautiful Carin orders hot tea and I order a dry vodka martini with a twist. We also order appetizers, since that's what we came for. Another 10 minutes pass and she finally brings out our drinks...cold water in coffee cup for the tea and dirty martini (gin) with 3 olives. I said, "this is wrong" and she said "how do you make a dry vodka martini?"...I could not make this up! Another 5 minutes go by and she finally brings out hot water for Carin and a martini glass full of relatively cold vodka, but no twist. When I ask about the lemon twist she says she will go right back and get it. The food arrives and about 5 minutes later, so does the "twist"...they took a lemon wedge and tried to scrape out the pulp and just give me the rind! I thought the rep on this place was that it was a drinks spot that just happens to serve decent food. How the frak (I used to use another word but in this post-Battlestar Galactica world, it seems that "frak" is more socially acceptable...whatever) can they screw things up this badly? How can a bartender at place like this not know how make the simplest drinks? It was just too funny! The food was mediocre at best, and by the time the bill came (and that's the only thing that gets this place a star...$22 for 3 appetizers and a marti), the servers hand was shaking because she was so nervous about even seeing us again. Carin and I were almost rolling on the floor laughing about how poor place was, so we had an entertaining evening, in spite of it all. We actually had fun rehashing the funny parts as we strolled home through mean streets of OTowSco (you read it here first) I don't think we will go back to American Junkie anytime soon.

After the Yelp Office hours yesterday at Bunna, Brian S. and I peeled off from the group for lunch. I hadn't had anything really "british" in a long time...maybe not since the last time I was in London (haggis, pasty, bangers and mash, bubble and squeak...I just realized that british pub food names sound a lot like a rough morning on the growler:) We headed east in search of authentic british pub fare (I have to use the word "fare" when I talk about british food...it's some sort of legal review requirement). We didn't make it all the way to London, but it still turned out alright. Jeff M. also attended Office Hours and told us about a new, and significantly less "fragrant" Cornish Pasty Company location at Dobson and Guadalupe, in the comfortable confines of Mesa:) Now when I look for authenticity in british pub grog, I start right at the front door. * When I walk in, do hear a nearly unintelligible version of the English language, with "h's" being dropped left and right and "v's" substituting for "th's" in most words? No, I didn't hear that at CPC! * When the barman and hostess smile at me, do I see the results of 85th best dental care system in the world, with the traditional "rusty picket fence" smile so favored by the English working class? I didn't see a hint of less than perfect dental hygiene at CPC. * If I'm trying to find a seat or a table, and politely inquire as the availability of a given chair or table, do I get a jaunty "piss off" in reply? I did not! I was becoming alarmed about the ability of CPC to produce a decent pasty, given the mounting evidence that CPC just "isn't the real thing", but I buried my misgivings and went ahead and ordered a Cottage pie.  I say, old boy! I needn't have worried a whit!  These delightful and extraordinarily tasty little footballs (American football...not soccer) of pastry wrapped meat, potatoes, veggies and spice are as authentic as Prince Charles (and roughly 4 times better looking).  They don't just make really good pasty's and pies at CPC, they make them pretty! They braid the dough on top of the pasty before they bake them...they get points for presentation! Brian had a chicken greek pie that also looked tasty and well made. CPC has a nice bar area surrounding the kitchen so you can watch the cooks at work (in another un-authentic touch, I didn't see single cook working over a large vat, with a cigarette dangling from his lips...I don't know how they made a pasty this good with all these handicaps:) The total bill for everything, including drinks, was less than $20 (another un-authentic touch...the last time I was in London, a pack of gum cost $20, although, in fairness to CPC, that might have something to do with the rate of exchange). Finally, although I don't normally review the restrooms, I will. After the meal, I had to "shake hands with unemployed" as we say across the pond (it can be a long and uncomfortable drive back to Scottsdale, otherwise). The restrooms are quite small and usable by only one person at a time, unless you have more of a "euro" sensibility and don't mind sharing the loo...I doo. So what's the verdict?  Nope, it's not like the local you'll find in London...thank god!  It's much, much better! Swing by and get a pint and pie at this new and non-stinky CPC!

A bit of a "nip" in the air this morning...and when I think "nip", I think "pasties" and when I think "pasties", well, I just naturally think "pasty's" :-)  So there you have it...that's how my mind works...I've said it before and I will say it again...linear thinking is the best thinking:)  I get so lonely working away in my plush private office with nothing to keep me company but a steady stream of information and diversions from across the universe...and my chowchow, DeeDee...sometimes I need to get out of my gilded cage:)  Today was one of those days, and fortunately for me, my cardiologist buddy, Jim, was in a position to prescribe a bangers and mash pasty at CPC, for my continued good heart health :-)  Stat - (Latin for "with a side of broccoli and cauliflower"...he says they are chock full of "beta blocker's"...I didn't even know I needed my beta blocked!)  We met for lunch with his longtime friend (and my new friend) Gary (who is, among other things, a novelist...I want to see how he works me and CPC into a book:)  I was pretty hungry after spin class this morning and the waitstaff at CPC wasted no time in getting the retox going for me...I think service has improved since I was here last and food remains authentic and excellent!  Neither Jim or Gary had ever been to CPC before, but they both handled their pasty's like pro's and the three of us all joined the CPC - "CPC" ("Clean Plate Club"...I think there's an award ceremony at the end of the year:)  Jim had an Oggie and Gary tried a Greek Something Pasty and both were fortified against the rigors of the remainder of Friday afternoon (Jim had some sort of "human heart thingy" he had to do, and I had to come back to my office and type on my computer...who has the more stressful job...really? :-).  Finally, the people at CPC all continue to be so darn happy and pleasant...I so often see people working at restaurants that look like they hate being there (and probably do) that it's worth noting when everybody from the cooks to the servers all have smiles on their  faces and in their voices.  It's probably from eating all those pasty's...they're approved by all of my cardiologist buddies, so you know they must be good for you:)

The Beautiful Carin and I accompanied the adorable DeeDee Anne to the park this morning, and what a nice day in the park! We really do love this place and there isn't a week goes by that I don't get over here! Sometimes to take Deedee for a stroll (just to be clear...I always make sure that I pick up after her...we are very conscientious about our "leave behinds"), sometimes it's for one of the many events in the park (Culinary festival next week...oh the eating and eating...ahhhh), sometimes to go to the library or SMOCA or the performing arts center (under reconstruction right now, but a really nice venue and I'm sure even better when they finish remodeling), or one of the great little spots that adjoin the park (AZ88, Orange Table, etc.). How's that for a world class run on sentence? There is always something interesting and pleasant going on in the park and this morning was typical...a couple of photo shoots in progress, young couples with their kids enjoying the morning, lots of people with their dogs, a couple of musicians (one guitar and one flute...different ends of the park, so that was good). The ponds are delightful, with ducks and swans (and the big lake has been cleaned so it doesn't smell...nice touch!). This place is really a serene oasis, and Scottsdale's "front lawn (BTW, McCormick-Stillman is the "back yard", you know, the one down the block owned by the guy who has the train set in the garden). Scottsdale really does a great job keeping this park up, and it's a great place to relax and recharge.

The Kitchen is the new, new thing in the space that used to be occupied by The Dish.  I have seen, in other locales, The Spoon, The Fork, The Table, and I suppose I will soon see other utensils (the Peeler, The Corer, The Spork?) and cooking locations (The Hot Plate, The Counter Top Microwave?) popping up with the apparent success of The Kitchen. And make no mistake...it is successful and it will continue to be successful. Why? Because it's good grub at a reasonable price! I stopped by for lunch after a meeting today and took a look around before I ordered. I was going to go over to the Village, but Gabi K. mentioned that this place was very good, and she wrote a review that made me believe in change, at this location, so Gabi, thanks for leading me here, and not astray ! The Kitchen has interesting and tasty options that cover a really broad spectrum of tastes, from full on sit down plated lunches (including a decent looking prime rib...what's not to like?) to pizza, to hot and cold sandwiches, soup and salads, as well as the attendant sides, deserts, etc. You can eat it there or take it with you, and everything is dead fresh! They also have what appears to be a pretty decent deli counter with the usuals (potato salads, sliced meats, etc.). Everything looked good and fresh and the place smelled good, too (an underrated and overlooked quality in too many restaurants). I had a cubano sandwich (like a Cuban but not grilled) and Fentiman's Curiosity Cola (I haven't had one of those since the last time I was in London...it tastes like cola would taste if you soaked a tree root in it...I guess that's the "curiosity" part...delightfully different!). I didn't like the Dish at all, but I do like The Kitchen. The staff is friendly and helpful, the food comes out quickly and well prepared, and the pricing is in line with reality (three of my beefs with the Dish...OK, I'll let them Rest in Peace, now). Gabi didn't steer me wrong! Give The Kitchen a try if you're near Gainey.

The Beautiful Carin and I went to Arizona Regional Mixer networking event last night (nice event and nice presentation by Gabi K, at the event!). We were going to go to the Giants-Cubs game after, but by the time we got home, the wind was blowing hard enough that small craft warnings had been posted on Tempe Town Lake and the wind chill was down in the teen's. What to do about dinner? TaDa! Silver Mine Subs delivers!!!! Within 20 minutes, they brought a quart of hot chicken noodle soup and a Chicken/Bacon and a Roast beef sub, right to my door, all hot and toasted. Seriously, these guys will make you want to throw rocks at the Subway and Quizno's stores (both also close by, but...no delivery...haha). The bread and the ingredients are fresh, and sandwiches and soup were well prepared and everything tasted great (does it really taste better when they just bring it to my door, or is it just me?). Give Silver Mine a try, esp. for delivery!

I am remiss in not writing my review of our dinner Tandoori Times a little sooner. In my defense, my ears hadn't stopped ringing from the background music for the belly dancer and I was unable to concentrate on the screen long enough to write a coherent sentence (at least I think that's why I can't write a coherent sentence:) The Beautiful Carin and I met the utterly delightful Jim and Audrey W. for dinner at Tandoori Times last Friday evening. I keep saying it, but one of the things I like about Yelp is actually meeting and getting to know real people in "meat world", as opposed to only getting to know someone online. It really gets down to the art of dining...pleasant conversation with convivial company, good food and drink, in an interesting setting.  We had all of those things Friday evening, and more! We also had Indian food at Tandoori Times!  I love Indian and Pakistani food.  I play squash and I got to know Indian and Pakistani food from the kitchens of the wives of some of my squash buddies...incredible meals and incredible hospitality...we could all take lessons:) We started with cocktails, 4 kinds of Naan (the Onion Naan was incredible...crusty and crunchy on the outside, literally filled with chunks of soft, savory/sweet roasted onion:) Appetizers included Aloo Tikki, a potato pancake with gravy (and you know how much I like gravy:)...good stuff. We passed things around, family style. We ordered dinner as we enjoyed our conversations.  It was great to get to know Jim and Audrey better and I'm glad we had some time to chat as dinner was served (really wonderful food...Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Masala, Lamb Korma and Kahari Shrimp...everything perfectly prepared, spicy and flavorful).  The service was warm and friendly:) All of the food was served family style with rice and more Naan to sop up the gravies and sauces...so good! Then came the belly dancing and music...there may also have been a fire engine parade and a Boeing 777 landing in the parking lot...it was so loud we'll never really know.  The sound system was really cranked for the lovely belly dancer and it was fun to watch  her for the first 15 minutes or so.  But after an hour or so, the fun of watching belly dancing kind of wore off, we wanted to get back to conversation (even though the belly dancer was brandishing swords and candles...it was a little like watching NASCAR...you don't want to see the wreck, but you don't want to miss it either. I'm happy to report that nothing was cut off or burned during the performance:) Sadly, conversation was rendered nearly impossible by the fact that someone had turned the amplifiers up to 11. Jim would ask me "what do you do for a living" and I would answer "I sold my motorcycle in 1978", with a smile, and he would look puzzled:) Audrey and Carin were having similar difficulties...it's just hard to have quiet chat when the background music is up around 107 decibels:) That said, we truly enjoyed the evening with our new friends! And we really enjoyed the food at Tandoori Times...I just recommend calling ahead to ask about the belly dancing, and bring the ear plugs if you go on belly dancing nights:)

Sadly, I had to put my handsome son Zachary and his lovely wife Sarah on a plane back to San Jose...the visit was done...they needed to get back to their real life and quit hanging out with the old man. But, before they boarded the Greyhound Bus of the skies, they needed a hearty breakfast to tide them over for their arduous journey! Bacon lay right in the flight path:) It wasn't exactly on a direct line between the Valley Ho and Sky Harbor, but I didn't let that deter me from getting my kids a decent meal before their flight! And it was a decent meal...more than decent...it was pretty good:) I know Bacon opened recently and that they had some early "teething" problems (why do we call it teething problems?...the restaurant is not a "baby" and will not actually grow anything with enamel on it...it just doesn't make sense to me:) Zach and Sarah each got versions of bacon and eggs (I guess the breakfast meat nomenclature was too much for them to overcome:) I had sausage and eggs with the home fries...did you know that they toss their home fries in brown gravy before they serve them?  I did not know that until the plate arrived, but the gravy earns them a "kudos"  (and an extra star:) from me...Gravy makes everything better, including breakfast:) The service was very good...I know, I know...it was 10:00 am on Wednesday morning and the place only had 6-7 customers, but Blake (our server) was friendly and attentive and helped Sarah get her order exactly correct. The portions are very large (not "Claim Jumper" huge, but more than I could eat for breakfast).  Three big eggs, three large sausages, four thick pieces of wheat toast, a big pile of gravied home fries and a fruit cup...for under $9.00:) A good value, a good time and a good meal...maybe Bacon's teeth have grown in:)

Poutine...a single word that can convey so much meaning!  If you are a Canadian, the words and melody from "O Canada" begin to ring in your ears, as your chest swells with pride and you think, of all the Canadian exports...Gretzky, Oil...Pamela Anderson...this is the best:)  If you are cardiac surgeon, you smile as contemplate your next Porsche, purchased with the fees received for the double, triple and quadruple bypass operations you will be able to perform on Poutine lovers:)  If you are the folks at Bacon, you apparently think "what can we add to this to make it even "healthier":-)  The Beautiful Carin and I took our lovely daughter, Whitney, to Bacon for breakfast this morning.  Neither had been there and this was good chance for them to give it a try:)  They had the "Yogi"...not named for the bear and the Yogi does not include a "pic-a-nic basket":)  The Yogi is an incredibly healthy vegi and egg white omelet, that they both professed to really love:)  Carin says this place stays in the rotation, so I know she was happy:)  And when Carin is happy, I am happy:)  I was almost transformed into a semi-vegetarian just by my proximity to their breakfast entrees!  Fortunately, I saw "The Hangover" on the menu and I was saved:)  The Hangover has a base of Poutine (french fries and popcorn cheese, covered in gravy:)...so bad, yet sooooo good:)  What they do then is magical...they throw ham and bacon on top of the poutine and then slide 3 over easy eggs on top of that:-)  I don't know who the genius was, that invented this little breakfast miracle, but I want to shake his or her hand before I have my coronary:)  Sunday morning...no wait...great service today and everything was tasty and fresh!  Tell me again why there's line at Breakfast Club?

So what is the dealio with fro-tang? It's a question that keeps me up at night, pondering...pondering. I needed an answer, so when I got out of the office and went for a walkabout in Old Town for lunch a couple of days ago, my route took me past the fro-tang palace in Old Town, Ice Tango! I thought (as I made my fateful decision to walk in) "frozen yogurt...how difficult can this be?" Plenty difficult, as it turns out! I was greeted by the guy who lost on American Idol (apparently, maybe a dead ringer), as I walked in.  He pointed to the 10 rows of soft serve machines and said "you can try any flavors you want" and indicated a stack of exquisitely tiny paper thimbles, in which I was supposed to put a small serving of fro-tang to try out. I had no idea what the fro-tang was going to taste like, so thought "good idea"...I could not have been more wrong. I approached the first soft serve udder, with a label that said something like "creamy tang-fro" and gave it a short pull. 2 1/2 cups of creamy tang-fro cascaded over the sides of my thimble and onto my hands (desperately cupped to keep the yo-tang from hitting the floor and marking me as a non-pro tang-fro jockey). I didn't really get a taste as I dumped the thimble and the extra 2 lb's. of yo-fro in the trash bin. While unsuccessfully trying to clean my sticky hands with a wad of napkins, I decided on another approach. I walked by the 30 different soft serve machines looking at lables in a hopeless attempt to find my standby...vanilla...no go for vanilla fro-yo. I did find some sort of chocolate blend, but it was in one of the 6 or so soft serve udders that were not in working order (swirling, cold, but the udders just wouldn't  give:) I finally settled on Mangy Tango (or was it Tangy Mango?) and Coconut Something combo. I got a small cup and by now well aware of the awesome dispensing capabilities of these hard core soft servers, I pulled the lever on the combo udder for 1 second...1 second! My little cup was only 1/3 full:) Just right!  I added a spoonful of strawberries to the concoction and took my prize to the counter to pay for it. Adam (probably not his real name) motioned that I should set my tangy treat on the scale...he was going to weigh it and I was going to pay $.38 per ounce for my sweet confection:)  Good Deal! I didn't have that many oz's:) $4.27?  Adam, do you want to weigh that again?  Are you kidding?  Who do you guys think you are...Sprinkles? I asked Adam how they hide the ballast in the cups.  Adam looks at me like I'm not all that funny...but I am:) I would tell you that I have never had better fro-yo-tang, but I had never had any of the stuff before. The Mangy Tango part was OK, but the Oil-Can Coconut had a chemical taste and I tossed about $3.49 worth of tang-yo into the trash(: So, no bro, on the fro yo from the tango.

I jogged by Ice Tango today for 10th or 12th time in the past 3 weeks (well, I was headed over to the canal for my run, and while I was running as fast as I could, I'm pretty sure it looked like a gentle "jog" to the race fans up and down Scottsdale Road...but I digress:)  I again saw the same sign on the door that has been there for at least 3 weeks since I first noticed it..."Closed today, will reopen tomorrow"...tomorrow has never come!  I slowed my pace to a slow walk and looked into the dark, dank interior of Ice Tango...the machines are all dead...the counters have crap all over them...except where there's dust all over them...not even the glow from the from the cordless phone...it looks like the power is disconnected...  I hope it wasn't something I said...

Living in a town known throughout the US of A for having decent Mexican food, and loving to eat as much as I do, you would think that I'd have pretty much hit all the high spots by now, wouldn't you?  I guess not!  I had not been to Gallo Blanco until yesterday for a lunch meeting.  It's a long way from Old Town, and while I still have the reflexes of a cat (well, an older cat, anyway), some of the drivers I see in my cross-town jaunts just make me want to curl up in my sock drawer and weep for days!  So I avoid the drive...no sense in letting the Beautiful Carin collect on my life insurance just yet:)  When I got there and saw the place, I thought, "well Donald, here we go...another over-hyped joint...don't get your hopes up."  But I tried to keep an open mind as my buddy ordered for us...Cochinita, Carne Asada and Tilapia Taco's that came in a little corrugated steel rack along with a couple of squeeze bottles of salsa (green and orange).  Precious!  I grabbed a pork taco...squeezed a little of the orange stuff on it and took a bite...and the angels sighed!  Smack my ass and call me Pepe'...go ahead...I know you want to!  I could not believe how delightful these tasty little morsels were...I mean stunningly good...all of them...including the Tilapia...so very, astonishingly good!  And I couldn't believe that I hadn't been here before (which is why you can smack me on the ass and call me Pepe')...but I won't be away from here for long.  My friend and I polished off  1/2 dozen taco's and then decided that we needed dessert...so we each ordered a Torta (a Naco and a Cochinita), and then split them so we each had  1/2...so very good!  Not many people would suspect this about me, but I am something of a contrarian...perhaps even a little bit cantankerous...esp. about places that don't live up to the hyperbole.  And then I write snarky reviews!  But I can't get snarky about Gallo Blanco...GB delivers on all the promises!  The menu is clever and innovative, deftly executed with ingredients that are clearly top drawer!  The service we received at lunch was prompt and pleasant without being cloying.  The décor and atmosphere are pleasant and inviting.  But the real star of the show here is the food...or maybe I should say "the 5 stars"...  Oh, I think I may have had better tacos, or torta's, but I can't for the life of me remember when or where it was!  It takes a lot to get me out of Old Town on a regular basis (Honest to frikkin' God, the way some people drive, I'm astonished there aren't 50 fatalities a day in PHX!) but GB makes taking my life in my hands seem worth it.  A new regular in the rotation...if I lived across the street like Thomas does, I think I'd eat my normal 7 meals a day here!

It's always good to see someone from the 'hood doing well.  Dutch Bros. Coffee was founded by 2 brothers, who happen to have a Dutch heritage.  My kinsmen, both geographically and nordicly:) They are from, of all places, Grants Pass, Oregon (do not snooze on the drive up I-5 or you will miss Grants Pass...actually, don't snooze while you're driving that section of I-5...you'll drive off a mountainside and miss some of the most spectacular scenery in the United States, because you'll have crashed). Dutch Bros. are still headquartered in Grants Pass. That seems like a pretty small town for a couple of guys who own a business like this, but I bet it doesn't seem small if you have a jet to get out of town...and I bet old Travis and Dane have a jet because they've sold an ocean of coffee over the past few years! Boy, do we know our coffee in the great northwest, or what (oh I know, I haven't lived up there for 15 years and it takes a threat of physical force to get me to go back to the ranch these days, but I still like to claim the place for something more than the rain:) After my run this morning, I had to go pick up my mail (and can anybody tell me why they moved my PO Box from the very convenient Osborne location to North Tempe?...it's about a 45 minute drive down there and back). And what do you want more than anything else after running 5 miles in 90 degree heat? That's right...a cup of piping hot coffee. I pulled into the drive through and said "set me up", then I got to the speaker and had to say it again. They got my coffee right the first time (right sweetener, right cream...it's why I almost never use drive through for coffee, but these guys made me happy). And best of all, it's good coffee! They don't seem to have a place to hang out and read your electro-mail or write your novel on your laptop (remember, the Dutch bros. are no-nonsense Oregon logging country boys...hard to read your electro-mail while you're dragging a Douglas fir out of the woods and your laptop is actually the top of your lap, but you do need decent coffee when you're getting up at 3:00 am to go to work). But I see you can get out of your car and walk up to the window and get your coffee and sit at a table outside...but with a long drive back to Old Town Scottsdale, I just didn't have time. The Dutch Bros. Coffee...quality, value, useful, practical and competent coffee...in other words...very dutch!

I saw that Red Tomato closed a while back and I kind of wondered what would go in to the location (48th St. and Indian School Rd). I don't think this location is the best spot for a restaurant (the parking is really bad, even with free valet...the access is difficult from Indian School Rd., and there isn't anything else around the Tavern, unless you want to get a haircut at V's, next door). You have to really kind of want to go to there:) After you try Arcadia Tavern, I think you may want to put up with the parking and traffic to get there. From the ashes of the failed pizza joint, the Arcadia Tavern has risen, Phoenix-like:) I braved the traffic and the parking and the legions of guys determined to get a haircut last week to grab lunch at the bar at Arcadia Tavern...I'm glad I did! I was solo and sat at the bar with 3 strangers and the delightful Lauren, our congenial bartender/hostess:) She was kind enough to recommend the prime rib dip sandwich...very tasty! The décor and atmosphere contribute to the light, bright open feel...in other words, very Arcadia:) I spent nearly an hour at the bar chit chatting with my fellow bar diners  (no longer strangers:-)...as a recovering raconteur, I can occasionally be a witty, charming, erudite and convivial conversationalist and luncheon companion...this day was one of my good ones...the meds must be working:) The Arcadia Tavern has been open for a month or so, and shows no signs of the "teething problems" that I understand restaurants (much like "babies") go through...I heard no wailing and crying, no requests for ice cubes or pacifiers, so it was a good day all around for me:) $10.50 for a good sandwich, tots and beverage...Not the cheapest sandwich you'll find, but a good value and a very pleasant place to have lunch!

I was going to write a two word update.  And those two words would have been "Tot Cho's"...a thoroughly delightful creation that they serve at the Arcadia Tavern...Tater Tots with nacho stuff all over them:) Yeah, that's right...nacho tot's!  The Beautiful Carin and I beginning to make a nuisance of ourselves here:)  Fixtures, denizens, habituates...  The patio has become a bit of a "home away from home" (but with drink's that I don't have to mix myself:)  We keep showing up:)  Last week, Carin correctly guessed the number of golf balls in the vase in the entryway, and she won us free drinks and food:)  Matt (the owner) is thinking of adopting us (although that would technically make Carin and I brother and sister...both creepy and hot at the same time:)  We haven't had a bad meal or bad experience yet...tonight they had a Jimmy Buffett (or Boofay, for my friend Ryan) clone , softly playing guitar and singing during happy hour:)  I am happy:)

I was looking to get my fix after the workout this morning. You know, a little something I could pop to ease the pain, perk me up, restore the flow...a coney island hot dog:) I headed for Joan's Cafe Kitchen...but my coney island dealer isn't on the corner anymore(: Joan has retired, sold out and moved on to greener pastures (well, I don't know about the greener pastures part, but the sweet people working at Cafe Villaggio told me the rest:) Cafe Villaggio, has popped up in Joan's old spot and it is a breakfast/brunch/lunch/panini/sandwich bar place (WOW, did I get tired of typing all those slashes:) Happily, Cafe Villaggio sells a "chili dog" that is suspiciously close to the coney that Joan's used to make on Saturdays...but here's the kicker...Cafe Villaggio will sell you a "chili dog" any day of the week! I don't know why they call it "chili dog"...there isn't a bean within 1000 yards of these things...the coney...I mean "chili" sauce is all beef and thick...a little sweetness, but savory, all the same...heavy with cumin and a little garlic and some cayenne for zip-a-dee-doo-dah:).  The hot dogs are all beef, steamed and served on a steamed poppy seed bun, with all the standard coney island accouterments:) It is a coney island in everything but name...and maybe that's a good thing.  Maybe they don't want this "coney" thing bandied about. It could be that they don't want to be known as coney island "pusher", so they hide behind a screen of "chili dog" names and panini's and omelets, as a way of throwing the local, state and federal dietary authorities off the trail! This little place is hidden next to the Big Lot's on Scottsdale Rd. in North Tempe (NoTem?).  Cafe Villaggio is scrupulously clean, the food is really pretty good, and people running it are sweet as pie (which they should immediately add to their menu to achieve lunchtime perfection). And a coney island (excuse me "chili dog") with all the trimmings, fries and bottomless beverage for $6.50?  Yes, Please:) I know this game...get me "hopped up" and  "hooked" with great stuff at cheap prices and raise the prices until I'm "strung out" enough to pay! Alright, Cafe Villaggio...I'll play your little game...for now:)

I'm sitting here emitting small, burgery burps of pure delight as I write this...no, sorry, there are just some things that you can't unread:) I walked over to David's for lunch today and found a Texas Burger, fries and a vanilla malt sitting on the counter in front of me...what was I supposed to do...ignore them? No...you can't ignore destiny and destiny was calling to me, in the form a 1/3 lb's burger, with an onion ring, crispy applewood smoked bacon, Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese and barbecue/ranch dressing/sauce (you read that right...they mix them together for the burger and damned if it doesn't work!) with a platter-full of fries:) This thing was everything you want from a diner burger, wrapped in wax paper and served still popping and sizzling from the grill. I was tempted to hoover that thing down in about 3 bites, but reason took over and I sat there at the counter and savored the burger and the experience of finding a new burger joint, sipping my malt (pretty decent malt, BTW), having a few fries and just letting a feeling of well being wash over me, like grease from a great burger down the front of the white dress shirt of my lunch hour (it's a metaphor:) This place is right off Scottsdale Rd., and in an era of flash and dazzle, this place won't win any interior decoration awards, but it's clean and relatively modern, they do have a big HDTV (doesn't everybody these days?), and a fireplace at one end of the place...the fireplace wasn't getting much of a workout today. David's menu aligns almost perfectly with the name of the joint...there are burgers and mexican food, and not much else. It's family owned and operated and nowhere near as busy as it should be! I haven't seen the pairing of burritos and malts anywhere else recently and that will be an interesting combo to try out one of these days. I'm gonna need to stock up on Pepcid AC:)

The perfect storm of circumstance, opportunity and Yelp Talk all came together today:)  The resulting irresistible mountainous wave of food based desire pushed me down the street, and back to David's Hamburgers & Mexican Food:)  I've been there several times since I wrote the original review and I will submit that there aren't many better spots for a burger, vanilla malt, or chicken mole` in Scottsdale (and I think I would bet money on the fact there aren't any other places where you could get all three in the same lunch order:)  Today was special, I saw a talk thread started by Samantha O, asking about chili, and remembered (that's right...so good I remembered it:) a chili-size I had there a couple of months ago...chili-licious:)  I also ran my morning route along the canal (6 miles, didn't get mugged, decapitated or any of the other things that are rumored to happen to unsuspecting canal joggers...perhaps it's because I'm a suspecting canal jogger:)...at any rate, I was sorely in need of a retox:)  And Pure is closed (another 1/2 written review, down the drain...oh well:) and it was probably too early to have a cocktail at Brackin's (even though it appears they are now open at noon! :-)  So I thought, "OK, I'll take the bullet and try the bowl of chili at David's, to see if it's really that good"...that's right, I threw myself on the chili bowl so you, my fellow Yelpers, would not have to...  You're Welcome!  David's chili is as good as the rest of their offerings...spicy, no-bean chili, plenty of heat for most flat-landers...if you are like me, you need a bit more heat and David's will hand you the bottle of hot sauce to get you there:-)  Add a vanilla malt and great and friendly service and what more could you ask for from your lunch?  Well, I'll tell you what more you could ask for...you could ask for Tom Jones in Las Vegas, circa 1974, playing on the 4 flat screens, in living, dazzling color...and that's what you would get...yup, "Delilah", She's a Lady" and, interestingly enough, his version of "Lucy in the Sky, with Diamonds" serenaded me during my delightful lunch today:-)  Vintage Tom Jones, new art on the wall and consistently terrific food and service move the needle to 5 stars for David's:)

I like reading about food and restaurants...no question about it.  Some of my friends write the best stuff about carne asada, amuse bouche, foie gras and other gastro-porn delights (if there can be gastro-pubs, then there can be gastro-porn).  When my buddy, Hotdish, wrote a glowing review of Sonora Mesquite and their carne asada, I knew that I needed to try it out myself!  Really, it's not like I'm just following Joel around, eating lunch where he eats lunch, having drinks where he has drinks, going to the movies where he goes to the movies...well you get my drift...it's a complete coincidence that I just happen to show up at the same places at the same times!  I follow lots of you around...via Yelp (so you don't need to be too worried that I'll show up at your respective houses).  But you could frankly do worse than to stalk Joel and eat at the places he recommends...the man finds some gems and he really knows his victuals!  So I got the restraining order quashed and headed out to Sonora Mesquite for some of the best food I've had (and I've had some good stuff, believe you me).  I've been back 3 or 4 times since I first dropped by and it's so damn cute...Selena, the owner, greets me like a long lost son every time...and she never remembers that I've been in before!  That cracks me up!  Selena is like my wise Latina mom (well, except for the fact she's younger than I am...and I'm not really as Latin as I look in my profile picture)...she is so sweet!  And...she makes everything from the carne asada and barbacoa to the charro beans, salsa and guacamole, herself...fresh...from scratch...every day (BTW, the folks at the Mission need to drop by and get a Guacamole making and pricing lesson from Selena...$1.50 for the same size side of guac that costs $15.00 at Mission...and isn't as good...maybe you're paying to watch it made at Mission).  It's hard for me to recommend any one thing...the taco's are sublime, the quesa's are wonderful, the charro beans and rice are among the best in town...the carne asada is (as Joel testified) some of the best around...in short...Sonora Mesquite is a wonderful little find...and heavily in the current lunchtime, retox rotation.  Drop by, say "hola!" to Selena and have a taco or a quesadilla...tell her I sent you...she won't remember who the hell I am, but that's OK...she'll treat you like family anyway!

To paraphrase Carl Sagan..."In order to create fillipino/mexican fusion cusine, you must first invent the universe"     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc  You will want to give that vid a look and a listen...preferably while enjoying some roasted piggy prepared by the utterly adorable Karey and friends:)  I had lunch with friends today at Karey's:)  A little lunch, a little solving of the worlds problems (without benefit of alcohol, this time:) even a discussion of the the galactic issues that confront us all (did you know that there is an excellent chance that the Milky Way Galaxy...our home...will collide with another galaxy (Andromeda), soon?!?!?  Less than 3.5 billion years...things could get very dicey!  Until then, whistle over to the SE corner of of 40th St. and Thomas Rd. and drop by and visit Karey.  She gave us samples (since who among us understands what fillipino/mexican fusion really is?  I will tell you what it is...it is really good!  I enjoyed samples of chicken coconut curry, pork adobo, the aformentioned piggy, beef mechado (no I didn't do that from memory...I took a menu:)  I was sorely tempted to to have the "all the above" platter, but I controlled myself:)  Pork adobo, Beef mechado and garlic rice, along with a shared order of lumpia egg rolls...just delightful:-)  I am happy to report that Karey's was busy during the entire lunch hour...I am also happy to report that Karey brought us a delightful little dessert cake to try...I did enjoy my lunch today:)  In the universe I've invented, single malt scotch flows like water, I have no need for tax attorneys and fillipino/mexican fusion cooking at Karey's Kitchen is here to stay:)  When you invent your own universe, be sure to include Karey's Kitchen...I might want to visit with you at lunch someday:)

Well...lookee what we got here...more frozen yogurt that you serve yourself and pay for by the ton:)  The last time I tried this (at Ice Tango) I was somewhat less than successful...I ended up with 11 lbs. of fro-yo on my hands and about 4 oz's of chemical tasting "yogurt" in my cup (which cost me about $28.00, if memory serves:)  I was much more successful and efficient at Yogurtland...and happier:)  I was focused...I was resourceful...I was sure handed...but mostly, I was lucky...they had vanilla (the Bentley of flavors) and I was rewarded for trying serve yourself fro-tang again, with clean hands and a reasonably priced cup of yo-fro:)  In the whirling vortex of irony and karma that makes up Old Town Scottsdale (or, as I like to call it "home":), Yogurtland is located cheek by jowl (you read that right, I was, in fact, born in a barn) with Sprinkles, home of hilariously priced crapcakes:)  Yogurtland has very good, reasonably priced treats (about 30 cents an ounce, with no lead weights in the crease at the bottom of the cup, like Ice Tango had:)...as juxtaposed with it's neighbor...who does not:)  The store smells nice and clean, the people behind the counter generally seem nice enough, everything works and the yogurt udders were not supercharged and easy for me to manage...I was able to get just the right amount of tasty vanilla yogurt in my cup to make about $1.50 treat...sweet, frosty and delightful!  You know what's a good way to dine out in Old Town?  Swing by Fred's for a couple of great marti's, and then wander across the street to Yogurtland for a delightful sweet treat and just call it dinner:)  That's how we roll in the 85251:)

The beautiful Carin and I went to the Village this morning for our respective workouts...She hit the cardio machines hard and I played squash with my buddies.  As I finished my last game with one of my buddies, Jim (who happens to be a cardiologist), he mentioned that I looked a little emaciated...peaked even, and prescribed chicken and waffles, "stat" (stat is a medical term that means "with extra butter, syrup and a side of grits":)  Fortunately for me there is a new emergency location for Lolo's that has opened up altogether too close to my home:)  Serendipity started to smile on me when we pulled up just as someone was leaving and we scored the parking spot right in front...serendipity continued as we put our name in for the 30 minute wait, only to be called after 15 minutes...and continued to weave it's way through the entire meal, as we got our drinks right away (really, is there much of anything better than a 1/2 gallon of sweet tea with your Saturday afternoon brunch?:), and we were waited on promptly and served right away.  I was saved from wasting away:)  I was particularly delighted for 2 reasons:       - This was only their second day open in Scottsdale and they were   absolutely slammed with both people eating at Lolo's and with take out orders, so it looked like the service was a little uneven...but the Lolo's staff were so darn nice to everyone, most of the customers seemed  to be pretty understanding:)       - This was Carin's first experience with Lolo's, and like all of her other "first times" with me, I wanted it to be both "special" and "delightful"...I am a loving, thoughtful and caring husband:)  We couldn't have asked for it to go any better, especially for going by so soon after they opened:)  The chicken and waffles are every bit as good as the original location down on Yuma:)...Carin has fallen in love with Lolo's, too:)  The decor in the new place is pleasant...welcoming and comfortable...I love the wash tub lighting treatments:)  And the staff continues to be pleasant (trending toward sweet as pie) to everyone...they could have been pretty tight-faced today, because they really did have a ton of people (all looking to get their chicken and waffle on) come by Lolo's today.  I wasn't expecting to give these guys 5 stars right out of the gate, but doggone it, they earned it!  Great food, great atmosphere, nice people and now, right in the hood:)  I wonder if Jim is going to send me a bill for the medical advice? :-)

Pho  It's pronounced "/feu/"...does that help anybody?  Okay...sounds like "fun" only without the "n", and "Thành" sounds like "tang", minus the "g".  If you run "Pho Thành" through a translator, it translates as either "Cheese Bar" or "The Streets"...or, as they say in Ho Chi Minh City (nee Saigon)..."Cheese Bar".  I couldn't say what a cheese bar has to do with this delightful little place...I didn't see any cheese on the menu, nor is there anything cheesy about the place...just straight ahead, well made, tasty (and although Dr. Andrew Weill shudders when he hears me say it)...healthy Vietnamese food!  And while I'm on the subject of Dr. Weill...since when did a sweaty 350 pound recluse (with the remains of the entire turkey dinner with all the "trimmin's" that he evidently had for breakfast floating around in his beard), become the "healthy living" guru for a generation?  I'm puzzled...not that I don't want his lifestyle...I do!  Still, it's a mystery!  There's no mystery at Pho Thành...just unpronounceable menu selections and great Pho!  I've learned over the years to make my selections either by pointing at the menu and smiling or by saying things like "I'll have a number 2 and number 38, with a diet Coke, please".  Back when I was very young and still had my swagger on, I would stroll into one of the great Vietnamese joints in Portland, sit down and say "Pho Me"!  So funny!...At least to me.  That phrase led to several misunderstandings, "incidents"  and police reports, as well as a lengthy stint of child support payments for little Nguyen Dat S. (although he really looks nothing like me...but I do get a Christmas card from him and his family every year...nice!).  But that's the dimly remembered past!  Yesterday, I met a couple of my buddies in the Mekong Delta (you know, the West Side vortex of great Pho...the triangle between Maxim, Da Vang and Pho Thành) and we had a great time at lunch!  My buddies are both attorneys, suckling at the supple twin teats of misery and money and the stories they tell at lunch would make most people writhe in despair...but not us...we are made of sterner stuff!  We split an order of Goi Cuon and Cha Gio and dug into our respective bowls of Pho...delicious, delicious Pho ...no question!  All of the standard high quality Pho prep tools are there to perfect your soup...sawtooth herb, basil, bean sprouts, and enough hot chili in several different forms to cause you severe pain the next morning...it lets you know you're alive...important at my age!  This particular Mekong Delta doesn't require a Ghe Nang or a Swift Boat to navigate, just hop on the light rail or risk your life in Camelback traffic and drop on by.  Just don't say "Pho Me"...

I have a dark and shameful past...Yelp is probably that best place for me to let it all out and begin the healing:)  Before I became the humble software marketing genius that I am today, I was a suit...a corporate stooge...I wasn't workin' for the man...in most cases, I was the man:)  During that time of my life, I picked up some very unsavory habits...including one of the most unsavory habits ever visited on self-important executives...fountain pens:)  God help, me...I still love them so:)  I still have every one of them and I still use them with regularity (I know, I make my living with the keyboard...more or less...but when I write for pleasure, it's usually on a fine Rhodia #19 graph pad, with one of my 73 lovely "writing instruments":)  There is something both soothing and exciting about the flow of ink on fine paper...sometimes, it's the only way to get a really coherent sentence together:)  Some of my pens, I can refill from my inkwell, but many require cartridges...cartridges that they don't always sell at Staples or Office Depot...  That's when I set off for the far reaches of Old Town Scottsdale and swing by Scottsdale Pen Company...home of all things pen:)  It's like a head shop, but for a different kind of addiction:)  What a gorgeous and glorious selection of truly marvelous writing instruments, writing instrument related paraphernalia and objet d'art:-)  They have the cousins to my Mont Blanc's, the younger brothers and sisters of my beautiful Parkers and Waterman's and Sheaffer's...they even have the utilitarian antecedents of my everyday Lamy's and Rotring's:)  They have beautiful new Acme's, Pelikan's and Pilot's and mechanical pencils, like my Faber-Castell Fat Boy:)  Oh, and the paper...lovely leather bound journals and tablets, beautiful Rhodia tablets from France...I get goosebumps! :-)  Finally, they have ink...lots and lots of ink...in cartridges, in bottles...and I need ink!  They had cartridges for my Cross and my Rotring, when I thought I was going to have to go to Colorado Pen or something...so glad I didn't have to go that route:)  It was definite "win" for me...I get to support a wonderful local business...I got to "use" a bunch of new pens (try that at Pink's)... and I got a whole new place to hang out and indulge my pen fantasies...at least until they get the restraining order:-)

I had lunch with a friend on Wednesday this past week...we were on the phone trying to figure where to rendezvous when the name "Tommy V's Osteria and Pizzeria" came up (I know...it's mouthful...I just said "Tommy V's":)  We are both fans of Tomaso's (see my excellent review of Tomaso's...oh wait...you can't...it's one of the 89 partially written reviews sitting on my laptop waiting for me to figure out what to say...well, trust me...it's an excellent review:)  And speaking of excellent, so is Tommy V's:)  What a delightful little adjunct to Tomaso's...the wood fired oven facing the bar and dining area, the flat panel TV above the bar tuned to Italian World Cup soccer...murmuring softly in Italian in the background...the place is very nicely decorated and the ambiance of the place is quiet and pleasant:)  And the food, my friends...the food!  In the end, it's pretty much always about the food and anyplace that bears Tommy's name is not going to disappoint in that area:)  I had a lovely Umbrian Sausage Panini...made the way a Panini is supposed to be made...on house baked flat bread (with wood smoke and dark brown blisters in the bread from the wood oven), filled with thin slices of savory Umbrian Sausage, caramelized onions and Italian peppers and set off perfectly with homemade garlic aioli...re-baked in the wood oven so that it was warm all the way through (very little that I dislike more than a panini that's still cold in the middle...that's just damn laziness! :-)  My buddy had a pizza...a custom pizza...the kind of pizza that I wish I could get Bianco's:)  And we didn't have to wait 3 hours for Tommy V's pizza:)...they brought out his beautifully blistered, crusty and delicious, Quattro fromaggio with artichoke hearts and caramelized onions about 20 minutes after we ordered...just about right for a pizza order:)  Once again, essentially edible art...smoky and delicious, hot from the oven...all the ingredients were perfectly proportioned (I think my friend has a special genius for ordering...this pizza wasn't on the menu, but clearly should be:)  The price to portion and price to value ratio are so clearly positive at Tommy V's that I didn't even bother to create a chart...Under $30 for the 2 of us and we couldn't finish all the food...my Panini alone was over 12 inches across, cut into quarters...easily enough for 2 people, and included a wild greens salad in a light vinaigrette...wonderful:)  We didn't try the bar out (lunchtime...on a Wednesday...meetings later...can't afford to look drunk:) although we did gawk a bit...an excellent selection of Italian beers, decent wines, scotches, vodka's...even bourbon's:)  The only thing that was a bit jarring was the service...but not for lack of service!:)  I don't want to rag on them for being too attentive, but they may want to throttle back on the love just a little...I was asked "how is everything" 3-4 times while I was in the middle of a conversation (we hadn't seen each other in while so we had a bunch to catch up on) or in the middle of a bite...listen...I really appreciate that so much more than the typical "where did everyone go?" kind of thing...just ease off the gas pedal a little bit...we already love you...we really, really do! :-)  And that's it...that's the only thing about Tommy V's that even remotely causes a ripple...they are just so very eager to please! :-)  So drop by 32nd and Camelback (remember...this is Tommy V's...not Zen 32...you would be disappointed:) and have yourself one of the best pie's or panini's you're likely to experience anywhere:-)

I need to state, for the Yelp record, that I don't live at the Optima Camelview.  My review is bound to be colored by my experience...opinions differ...yada, yada, yada:) I think I'm good with the TOS, but if I'm not, I'm sure someone will let me know.  My buddy Mike Z was in town for a week or so...down from Seattle...it was great to see him!  We've been friends for 20 years, and you know what, I don't have that many friends of that duration!  We do have a good time and this week was no exception...one of the things Mikey came to town for, was to look at buying a condo or 5 (this seems to be a "buyers' market" for these things:)  So, I went with Mike on a couple of his forays into the wacky world of Phoenix/Scottsdale real estate, to help him try to buy a couple of bargains...heck, we were thinking we might even partner up on a few of these things:)  First stop...Optima Camelview.  In the immortal words of Bette Davis, "what a dump!":(  We parked underground and met the realtor (another Yelp one star, in her own right, but that's another story:( and started to go through these places...the first words (and really, for me they continue to be the most apt words about Scottsdale's own OC) that came to mind were:  * Hive * Warren * Catacomb * Mausoleum  I'm a reasonably bright guy and I have a good imagination, so I can see what they were going for, but the OC just doesn't rise to the level of "new age hanging gardens of Babylon".  The place feels lifeless and sad...possibly an interesting concept that was poorly planned, poorly executed and now threatens to collapse under its own depressing weight (and maybe all of the dead plants that the residents apparently can't afford to take care of:(  The fit and finish of the entire place is just "off"...doors that didn't fit/wouldn't close or open...handles and moldings broken off of walls in the hallways...lights that didn't...not what the people that bought into the OC at the "high" expected, I'm pretty certain...  We went through 5 units at the OC...all of them supposedly "owner occupied"...maybe they were...that just makes this so very much sadder:(  The units we saw were, at best, disappointing and depressing...and at worst...squalid:(  * 2 of the 5 units had the power turned off, but people were living in these units (candles everywhere, wet towels from the morning shower)...I don't know how you can watch the 48" plasma HDTV without power, but these units both had all the toys and Pottery Barn furniture...just no juice:(...BTW, you don't want to open the refrigerator in one of these units...I thought we had stumbled on a body or two in the dark:(  * 2 of the 5 were furnished in a style I like to call "early futon and card table"...we were told that these people had paid more than $450,000 for these units...and they only had a futon and a card table...oh and the 48" plasma HDTV...you can't live without that:)  * The 5th unit was just destroyed...very serious rage going on here...every knob and pull was broken off every cabinet...at least those with the doors still attached...the handle for the patio door had been broken off...2 holes punched in the drywall (which, for some reason was untextured in this unit...strange...:(...asking price for this unit was exactly what they had paid for it...extremely optimistic in my view:)...the realtor said the same thing she said in each unit she showed us..."you could offer less!"...Really, bright eyes?...Well, I see now that real estate is just way too complex for me..."we could offer less"...who'd a thunk it?  * All of the units we saw (and most of the units we could see from the units we looked at...which was essentially all of them...there is no such thing as a private deck or living room in this place) had dead and dying plants...while the idea of having each deck share a little "garden" with their neighbor might be nice, the reality is that the mulch spills onto the deck, the plants don't get sun or water and they are dead brown reminders of the dead, brown life too many of the inhabitants of this labyrinth are likely leading:(  Maybe this place will come back to life...they (they being people who are much smarter than I am about real estate) say real estate always does... but it's going to take a few years...or something...  For now...one sad and desperate star:(  We passed on this OC:(

I walked up to the counter and said, "I'll have an Italian Beef, Hot, with provolone and hot Giardiniera, Full Dip"!  Lobby (I don't know if that's his name, but he's the owner and the place is called "Lobby's", so...) looked at me, puzzled and said "what part of Chicago are you from"?  I know...ending a sentence with a preposition...so authentically Chicago!  He was puzzled because my accent ain't exactly South Side...but I've spent a lot of time in Chicago over the years and one of the things that I developed there is a taste for Italian Beef Sandwiches, made just the way they make them at Lobby's...WOW is that good!  I was extra fortunate today, because he had just taken 50 lb's. of roast beef out of the oven, to  slice up for my sandwich (well, OK, and other peoples sandwiches, too)...and I got to stand there and snorkel in the aroma as they unwrapped the top of the roasting pans, right on the counter in front of me!  The aroma of roast beef, oregano, pepper, onion, garlic...in other words, exactly what you want your roast beef to take a bath in!  Lobby makes his own marinade and roasts the beef wet, low and slow in a method that I like to call "nearly perfect"...he is proud of his place and of his food, and it really shows!  For me, it always starts and ends with the food itself.  Oh sure, I like to be pampered with spectacular service and surroundings as much as the next over-fed, self-absorbed, slightly insecure Brahmin, and the service was good and the place is clean and bright...but it really is about the food.  And the food here is remarkable...a simple menu of Beef, Hamburgers and Hot Dogs...done the way that Lobby grew up loving in his hometown of Chicago and done with loving care...the result is a Chicago style food experience that almost can't be matched here in the desert!  I do like my sandwiches and I did, would and will go out of my way to drop by Lobby's for their signature item (BTW, notice the name...it isn't Lobby's Burgers and Dog's...make no mistake, the Italian Beef is the big deal here).  While there are couple of places around here that make an Italian Beef that comes close to Lobby's, none of them have invited me to smell the wonderful aroma of the beef just as it comes out of the oven and that made Lobby's a 5 star experience today!  And for those of you concerned about where my nose has been, well, I keep my nose clean...at least that's what I tell my parole officer.

You know how it is...you have been working all morning...on the phone...on the web...answering emails, IM's...on Skype with the euro's...you really need to get out of the office and clear your head, no matter how gilded, plush and well appointed that particular cage is!  You need to get out in the real world..."rub shoulders" with the masses...you know..."press the flesh" with the hoi polloi:)  BTW, those are both euphemisms, as I have discovered through trial and error (not to mention lengthy lectures about "boundaries" and "personal space" from various law enforcement officials and other members of the legal profession:)  So I filled my backpack with my notebook and its power source, my aircard (wifi is great, but a little unreliable at times), my notepad (the paper one...no power cord needed), the folio that my notepad lives in, various pens and pencils (including my beautiful blue Parker fountain pen), post-its, my bluetooth earpiece for my phone, my phone, my newspaper, my current book and my reading glasses.  Whew!...That backpack was full as a tick and ready to pop...you know, it's always the same problem...you finally get your sh*t together...then you discover that it's too heavy to lift:)  Anyway, off I went to Sola for a little slice of humanity and a couple of cups of extraordinary coffee!  Sola is a lovely little spot to spend an hour or two, sitting at one of the big tables, enjoying the conversations around you, the soft music playing, the hissing of the espresso machine as the delightful owners make the various coffee and tea concoctions...and a really extraordinary cup of coffee!  At Sola, they always grind the beans fresh when I ask for a cup...then they put a single cup filter (with the perfect amount of fresh ground beans) on top of the cup...then they pour perfectly heated water into the single cup filter and let it percolate into the cup for a perfect cup of coffee...that's right...I said "perfect"!  I know, there are cappuccino and espresso and latte enthusiasts out there saying "Donald, you just described a mere cup of coffee...it's not the caramel macchiato with whipped cream ambrosia that I usually drink!"  Well, I hear you...and I would be willing to bet that those kinds of coffee drinks are also excellent at Sola...but...I like my regular cup of coffee and I enjoy my cup of coffee at Sola more than any other single cup of coffee that I can recall...esp. given that I pay Sola about what I would pay for a large cup of crappy coffee from Charbucks:)  The coffee at Sola is never sitting in an urn...never on the heat...never not perfectly fresh and well made (I know...double negative...but artistic license wins out over correct grammar:)  Add in the fact that the people working at Sola are so nice, pay so much attention to detail in making my coffee and that they have created such a nice spot to relax, work and enjoy my coffee...well, I will submit that it is worth your time to swing through Old Town and discover Sola:)  If you see me at Sola, you are welcome to "rub shoulders" with me but please don't "press my flesh"...I bruise easily these days:)

When I first heard about this place going in to this little space in  Scottsdale, I initially thought it was going to be an Italian restaurant...a cute little play on the Italian alphabet.  F'n A, F'n B, F'n C...I know...not really Italian at all...more Brooklyn and Bronx.  But it's not Italian at all...it's world food...world class, world of comfort, world food.  After a number of meals at FnB over the past year, I'm trying to recall a dish that didn't knock my socks off...and I can't think of a single item!  Last night was no exception!  Chef Charleen was in the kitchen giving everything from roasted chickpeas and a little piece of cheese, to fried green tomatoes and braised leeks, her special touch...innovative, imaginative, interesting...but never at the expense of the food itself.  She uses simple ingredients, her skill and imagination, and obvious love for the art of cooking, to make every dish special and astonishing.  One of the things I love about going to FnB is just walking into the place...You can tell it's going to be a great meal just from the fabulous aromas coming from Chef Charleen's kitchen...plus, who doesn't like the Technicolor floor in this place!  The Beautiful Carin and I have had a few things to celebrate lately and another terrific dinner at FnB seemed like a fitting way for us to enjoy a lovely Saturday evening together.  In addition to sharing our braised leeks and fried tomatoes and what-have-you, we spent our dinner feeding each other Red Snapper (pan-fried with a dusting of cumin and couscous) and pasta with bacon and morels...satisfying and rewarding entrees, that delighted us both with the flavors and with the quality of the food and the preparation!  A quick word about the service at FnB...and that word is "welcoming"...Pavle and his excellent staff encourage you to linger just a little bit longer...to enjoy your conversations and relax with your meal...to enjoy the ambiance and the fact that you are in another world for while.  So we did...with coffee, cordials (Chartreuse will set you free) and some of the best little sweet treats you will ever eat...Butterscotch Pudding that is sublime in both its simplicity and subtlety and Chocolate Date Cake...nutty, chocolaty and cinnamon-y.  People occasionally ask me to name my favorite restaurant...I know, that surprises me too!  When they do ask, I'm generally hard pressed to pick out one particular restaurant from the five or six that I would consider the best places I've ever eaten...and FnB easily falls in that top five.  But I will tell you that if I had to eat at only one restaurant for the rest of my life...I would do just fine at FnB!

Organizational cognitive dissonance (I just coined that phrase...copyright 2010, by me) is nearly impossible to overcome...especially in a bureaucracy as mired in its own excrement as the State of Arizona Motor Vehicles Division.  It is a discomforting and uneasy thought.  If a clerical person mis-enters a string of numbers in a computer terminal somewhere...it can alter the trajectory of your life...in both good and less good ways ("the bank just made a mistake in your favor...you have $7 million extra dollars"...yay!...you tried to withdraw that $7 million..."you're under arrest for Grand Larceny").  It's like a game of hopscotch designed to break your leg.  It's the reason people react with uncontrollable, explosive diarrhea when they hear the phrase "I'm from the government and I'm here to help you".  It's the reason people go "postal" and climb a tower with an AK-47 and one bottle of water (they won't be thirsty for long)...and it's the reason so many people view the "government" as a noxious weed, growing stronger by the minute, feeding on the flayed carcasses of its citizens.  No, not me...but I know people who feel that way.  Although I do have good excuses to feel that way, for any one of several reasons...the latest being my time in the 11th circle of hell known as "dealing with the MVD".  The MVD made a small error on a string of numbers (either a person or "machine"...I use quotes for "machine" because clearly the MVD's computers were manufactured by Charles Babbage, circa 1866...their brass cogs, cams and gears long since ground down to an unusable state).  The result of this was a mis-match between my registration information and my insurance information...easily resolved...both numbers are memorialized in many places, in many ways...years of insurance records...years of registration data for my car...the stamped VIN plate riveted to my car...the letter and printout's sent by my insurer, to the MVD, verifying coverage...a million and one pieces of proof!  It was easy to see that this was not my error...not an error by the insurance company...but an error somewhere deep within the bowels (and I use that word advisedly) of the MVD.  Surely, they would rectify their error, once it was brought to their attention...  Not so fast...Selma and Patty at the MVD say that their data is inviolate and no amount of proof by me or my insurance carrier could change that outlook...the letters were sneered at "the VIN on the letter doesn't match our records"..."the registration doesn't match the insurance verification"..."the registration doesn't match our records".  After more than 15 phone calls (total time on hold of almost 10 hours), 7 letters, 3 visits to the MVD, and more hassle than anyone should have to bear...I was told earlier this week that all was in order...I could return to the MVD and get my tags.  I showed up...took a number...waited my turn...sat down at window 19...and was told "tough luck"...no go on the renewal.  Did I scream?...Did I threaten?...Did I bazooka barf all over the counter?...yes, in my head.  And I probably looked like I was about to go "postal".  But I didn't...I kept my cool...me and Obama...cool guys...to the bitter end.  In person, I once again calmly explained what had happened and showed my MVD "service adviser" my proof (including my letters, prior registrations...the whole wad that I had brought along...just in case).  I may have discovered one of the few helpful people at the MVD...certainly one of the few with an IQ above room temperature and one of the few not completely imbued with the "we are the MVD...we don't make mistakes" attitude...he called a supervisor of some sort over...they typed for a while in the computer and viola`...I had a tag!  Oh, before I forget...they charged me a late fee...for their mistake.

Yabba, Dabba, Doo! :-)  http://tinyurl.com/45psjk  That's what I thought the first time we strolled into Fred's at Barney's in Scottsdale Fashion Square (BTW, anyone have any idea why they call it "Scottsdale Fashion Square"?...It's not a Square...it may or may not be Fashionable, too close to call...It is in Scottsdale...so, maybe 1  1/2 out of 3? :-)  How wrong I was about the origin of the name, and how very happy I am to have found one of the best little restaurant and bar combo's in all of Scottsdale.  The place is actually named for Barney's son, Fred (also apparently long departed, like Barney, for the great cocktail lounge in the sky:)  But I'm still here and while I am, I will take every opportunity I get to soak up the cocktails, food, ambiance, service and convivial chatter at Fred's:)  Fred's is as pleasant a place to dine as anyplace I've found in Scottsdale...the food and cocktails are excellent, the service is as good as anywhere in town, the room itself is both comfortable and sophisticated (overlooking scenic Scottsdale Rd....although the décor and scenery inside is also delightful...esp. at lunch during the week...if there is a larger gathering of attractive women in a single place at noon, I don't know where it would be:)... and the people...they are all first string...everyone at Fred's is a delight, from the hostesses and wait staff, to Richie the Barman (more about our pal, Richie later), and the managers of Fred's:)  After working all morning and finally finishing things up for 2009, it was time for a cocktail:)  The Beautiful Carin and I dropped by Fred's to ring in the New Year (at least it was midnight in Minsk, Prague and London while we were there:)  That's right, we closed Fred's down, yesterday...at 5:00 pm:)  We sat at the bar and had some delightful afternoon snacks and several cocktails as we chatted and laughed with Richie, the bar manager (and the Best Barman in Arizona:) and several other afternoon revelers (including the guys who put together all of Barney's "look and feel"...incredibly talented guys:)  More about Richie...Richie is simply the best barman I've encountered here in Scottsdale...he's a certified genius at creating cocktails that are both imaginative and tasty...the 007 martini, the Pomegranate Lemon Drop (Richie's Special), his brand new Blueberry...10 oz's. of ice cold, alcoholic pleasure in a glass:)...and Richie is the kind of guy that makes me feel like I'm in Manhattan, sitting in the bar at the Waldorf, helping the barman solve the problems of the world...he can talk about anything and he's got that great NYC personality:-)  Even more than the cocktails, the atmosphere is stylish and sophisticated...something that other bars and restaurants try for, but can't (quite frankly) match...again, Fred's feels more like Manhattan than Scottsdale...and that is the right atmosphere for this marvelous little spot:)  David (the GM) has put together a very talented team of the best and brightest from a number of high end establishments in the Valley of the Sun and essentially given them free reign..."Here's the framework, create what you want and the customers will come".  The result is an interesting menu and top notch execution (where even the Club Sandwich and Pomme Frites both have interesting and subtle notes), where everything is made with fresh local ingredients and obvious care and attention to detail:)  No kidding, even the chicken wing appetizer is spectacular!...(you should see the "ladies who lunch" hoover those little bad boys down...delightful:-)  Fred's just charms me:)  So, I think I can be forgiven for my little bit of whimsy (you know, the Flintstones thing:) because Fred's (and Barney's, by extension) inspire a little bit of whimsy...especially after two or three of Richie's signature martinis:)  Yabba, Dabba, Doo!!

They thought that they were going to make me cry "uncle"...or at least cry after I said "very spicy" for the Garlic Beef...and very spicy, it was...but they didn't know who they were dealing with...or "with whom they were dealing", for you grammarians out there:)  I like Thai food...more specifically, I like spicy, well made, flavorful Thai food!  That's what you get at Touch of Thai...currently holding the title of "Best Thai Food within Walking Distance of my Home":)  This is a lovely little spot, a little bit off the beaten path...and by "beaten path" I mean that it is about a block off Scottsdale Rd. and parked between a defunct gym and an "Asian Massage" joint, in between a bunch of offices.  It's across the corner from "Giligin's (every now and then you can hear gales of laughter from across the street as somebody "tosses a midget" or something:)  The restaurant itself is lovely, with a little courtyard between its two dining areas (kind of an unusual layout), and nice open feel, a pretty little bar area...oh yeah, and the food is terrific!  A very nice Thai couple own and operate this place, and the food reflects the love and attention to detail that they put into their restaurant...the young lady that owns the place is also (apparently) the main cook and the other night when The Beautiful Carin and I had dinner, she was very concerned about over spicing the Garlic beef, and came out to see if I was going to be OK, with it (she even offered to remake the dish if I had a problem with it...but I didn't...for whatever reason, I seem to be able to metabolize capsaicin like it's candy:)  Other people try to hang with me on the hot stuff and say things "oh my god...I think I just ate the sun" and "it tastes like burning" while I ask for "more chili oil or sriracha, please":)  Carin doesn't like the heat so much so we had our Pad Thai (I know, seems kind of boring, but they make the dish so darn well at TOT) at medium spice and our veggie curry at low heat, all tasty and delightful!  Speaking of curries, if you are a curry fan, you could worse than to stop by TOT...they have a couple of menu pages seemingly devoted to a wide variety of yellow, red, green, blue, orange, and other rainbow colored curries (I might be exaggerating about some of the colors, but I've had some of the red and yellow curry dishes and they are as good as any I've found around here:)  They even have a whole rack of these curry dishes on their lunch special menu ($8.95 for a giant plate of lunchtime Thai:)  The next time you're in Old Town, bored by the Modern Steaks and Olive and Ivy's, get off the beaten path and give TOT a spin...they are nice people, good cooks, they seem to find both flavor and heat back in the kitchen...and if you are in the mood, you can stroll down the block after dinner or lunch and get an "Asian Massage" to "settle your stomach" :-)

Yay...I am a fan...of anybody that will sell me Blood Orange Olive Oil, or Castile Olive Oil or even Chemlali, from Tunisia:)  Yes, I am a fan because they also let me test a bit of each variety...truly delightful (and heart healthy, too:)  I am so very pleased to see new business opening up in this formerly deserted alleyway (now called "The Frontier Shops"...although for the life of me, I can't figure out what luxury olive oils and infused balsamic's have to do with the "Frontier":)  But, I don't waste a lot time thinking about it, either:)  I just enjoy:)  If you are a cook (I'm talking to you Hotdish and you Deb and you too, Sarah G:), or just love someone who cooks, you will want to swing by OOO&V for EVOO and pick some up...to use in your cooking (Blood Orange EVOO on pork chops...be still my beating heart:)...or just to delight that someone special:)  I also want to take a moment to say a word about the balsamic vinegars...that word is "scrumptulescent"...no kidding...this stuff is deligthful...and you can use these for so much more than making a vinegrette (although I guarantee you can make a wonderful salad with any of these:)  I happened to wander in today, after lunch...the day before they officially open...but they treated me like a customer and showed me stuff and let me try stuff and I bought some stuff (they were bottling the olive oil and vinegar on the premises, as we chatted...I'm sure they appreciated me coming in and interrupting  their prep:)  So, four stars for these intrepid ladies and their entrepreneurial spirit...let's all raise a cup of olive oil to them:)

OK, another up market hot dog joint...good enough hot dogs...rows of beautiful, state of the art condiment dispensers... lovely tables and décor...and I am just not getting it.  I like hot dogs as much as the next red blooded, all American boy...maybe more...but I do not understand how these places can make it on dogs...in fact, I don't think they can.  It seems that these new upscale kind of hot dog joints have a menu that stops just of short of being a Fox Restaurant Conniption...everything from yam fries to prime rib dip on the menu!  But, I came in for a hot a dog and a hot dog is what I got...for $2.65 US Dollars.  It was a particularly necessary and poignant retox for me...not only did I get in a nice run this morning, but I had to go to the Arizona MVD to finally complete the process of getting new tags for my car...a process that took over 4 months and more than 25 hours of my time on the phone and waiting at the MVD...which is another review about the adequacy (or lack thereof) of the data processing systems, processes and employees of the State of Arizona Motor Vehicle Division.  I celebrated finally emerging from the gantlet, bloodied and scarred, but unbowed...with a hot dog!  The hot dogs themselves are reasonably priced, pretty well prepared, served on little "loaves" that have been toasted and buttered (I think you know that in my world, butter=goodness).  I looked around, and they don't seem to tout any particular type of sausages or wiener manufacturer (you know...like Schreiners or Schuylers or imported from Buffalo, NY, or specially made from baby seal scrotums or something)...but the wieners were certainly serviceable.  The service was also "serviceable" but was more like a standard "hot dog stand"...not the most personable group behind the counter...and if you are trying to upsell to justify the rent and the build out of the space in a mall like this...you just might need a little personality...as well as the ability to do more than ask "ja want fry wit' dat?"  Finally, as I ate my wiener (go ahead...snicker...I'll wait...done?...OK) I noticed another slightly "off" element to the HDS...the music playing sounded like Greek ballads (which may be the case, since I thought the accents behind the counter sounded Greek) and they were playing rather loudly...although the obligatory flat screen was tuned to ESPN and was also turned up...committing 1st degree cacophony.  One set of sounds or the other...not both...and by the way, since when is the background music tuned to what the staff or owner wants to listen to, as opposed to what the customers want to hear?  I'll tell you when...at good old divey, cruddy, greasy hot dog only hot dog joints, where the radio is playing what the cook wants and nobody had better mess with the settings.  But that's not what HDS is trying for...they may need to rethink a couple of things if they want rise above the rest.  2.5 stars for an average hot dog, mediocre service and the odd ambiance...and I just don't round up...esp. after a trip to the MVD...sadly.

Empire building is a curious thing...there are always a bunch of supporters and camp followers at first...then the wind changes direction for a while and people begin to have their doubts about the empire.  Sometimes, actual revolution follows and heads (quite literally) roll!  I wonder what will happen to the Fox Restaurant Empire in the future?  Will there be a revolution?...will Fox launch a "Death Star" to destroy "rebel" restaurants?...will they change to become a representative restaurant democracy (electing a new leader every 4 years or so?)...or will they simply fall into decline and decay away, like the Romans?  For now, they seem to be riding tall...good for them!  Some of the Concepts are (it seems to me) more successful (in every sense) than some others...Bloom is disappointing in its execution, Modern Steak is just OK for the price, Sauce is pretty tasty and, in my opinion, Culinary Dropout is the best of the breed, so far (OK, I haven't visited all the far flung reaches of the Empire quite yet...you know the sun never sets on the Fox Empire).  The Beautiful Carin and I had dinner at CD again last evening, after dropping by Old Town Tavern to have a couple of belts, say "hi" to friends and watch people tuning up for the Scottsdale Culinary Festival (a Saturday afternoon debauch of the 1st order).  We have yet to have a bad meal at CD...esp. given the price points...and that always makes me happy!  Pub Burgers, Pretzel Fondue, Fish and Chips, Fried Chicken, Potato Chips (and you know I'm a sucker for fresh house made potato chips), Prime Rib Dip and rest have all been tasty, well prepared and nicely presented by very friendly and attentive wait staff!  What's not to like?  For me the answer is "nothing"...esp. when you add the lovely décor (it kind of reminds me of my own living room...even out on the patio), the ambiance and convivial atmosphere and the wonderfully relaxed dining experience at CD.  Last night, we took our time, enjoyed a leisurely dinner on the patio, watched people, chatted with our fellow diners and just let the warm, comfortable spring evening settle over us...in other words, the quintessential Scottsdale experience!  For that, I salute the Fox Empire...Pax Fox.

The Countess, she is beautiful, she is talented, she is delightful and she is bountiful, she is saucy (in the "salsa" sense of the word, not the "descarado" sense of the word:)...she's also cheap:)  But then again, so am I:)  It's Taco Tuesday (as I write this...who knows when I'll finish it and post it...maybe next Taco Tuesday...maybe not:)  But today, I needed to retox after my run along the mighty Scottsdale River (or the Crosscut Canal as the flatlanders refer to it:)  I was going to wander over to Cien Agave, when my buddy called and said he'd gotten done with an open heart surgery early (usually, that's a very bad sign, but not today...he said everything went "swimmingly":) but after 12 hours of holding someone's life in his hands, he too was in need of a retox:)  We agreed that it was time to go see The Countess:)  I've seen a bunch of glowing reviews on good ol' Yelp and as I always do when I read the praise heaped on a particular place by my Yelp brethren and sistren, I thought "I'll be the judge of that!":)  Not that I don't trust the reviews...I do, or I wouldn't have jumped in the rig, pulled the belts tight and lit the turbocharger in order to get my retox going:)  No..."trust, but verify"...those words were given to all of us during an episode of Death Valley Days by a nearly washed up actor (whose name escapes me at the moment)...   http://tinyurl.com/yfg9e39  Well, it's all true enough...the black mole chicken is subtle but spicy...the cochinita is saucy and inviting...the dog shark taco may be made with the only fish that travels well to the desert (no, don't get too excited...not the best fish taco I ever had...but very good:)  And more than enough to eat from an inexpensive platter of softball sized tacos (I know, I called The Countess "cheap" a few paragraphs ago, but what I meant was a solid value:)...Two big, round, tumescent taco's with rice and frijoles'...$7.59, USD:)  And plenty of salsa...oh yes...lots and lots of salsa...saucy, saucy salsa:)  None of the legendary "strawberry salsa" today (probably like the Yeti...plenty of sightings, but no actual evidence:)...but I didn't care...they still had a dozen salsas to choose from:)  And all the salsas seemed to complement my taco's...how is it even possible that Peanut Salsa and Smokey Chipotle Salsa BOTH taste exquisite with the moles and the pork shoulder?  I don't know...I asked my buddy...he's a trained physician and he didn't know either (so what good is he?...unless I need a heart transplant and then, you know...he's a god:)  As I contemplated all of the fresh and interesting selections available at the salsa bar, I thought to myself "well, it's a bar, why don't I just pull up a chair and make a day of it?" :-)  After The Countess herself came out and asked me to please eat at my own table and quit embarrassing myself and my lunch buddies, I remembered that this kind of thing is what got me banned from the Top of the Mark in San Francisco (although I will tell you what I told the SFPD...having a Caviar Bar with bar stools in close proximity is just asking for it:)  We finished our delightful lunch without further incident and agreed that this place should be much closer to our respective homes and open 24/7 so we can walk over and grab a burro or a platter of tacos whenever we feel like it...which would be pretty much every day, for at least 2 meals:)  Do you think The Countess will go for that?

I was headed to Taco Tuesday, after my workout this morning...the traditional Tuesday retox after the detox:)  Instead...I ended up "crepe'd" :-)  I sprained my ankle playing squash a week or two ago, so unfortunately, no running this morning (or for the past week or two for that matter:(  But, I was able to get on the bike and grind it out today, and I was getting "peckish" by the time noon rolled around:)  I head out into the mean streets of Old Town Scottsdale for my rendezvous with a platter of good-'n-greasy tacos, when I remembered that Gabi had mentioned that a new sandwich shop had gone into the space once occupied by the Ice Tango yogurt shop I may have inadvertently killed...(BTW, The Beautiful Carin and I read the article in Inc. and we both agree...Gabi's not a day over 25 and not just compact and bubbly...she's frikkin' adorable:)  I decided to give SWC a whirl:)  I made a u-turn (which for some reason, seriously confused a covey of cotton topped and henna red-crested snowbirds following me down the street...I was walking and it shouldn't have caused much confusion, but they all scattered like frightened barn swallows when I changed course:)  At any rate, SWC is open for business and has been since Saturday:)  Terri and her BF have partnered to bring this little space to life and I think they might just make a go of it...not just for the sandwiches (which look good enough to be sure)...but for another feature of the place...crepes:)  I was just looking for a sandwich when the crepes reached out and grabbed me and said "sit here and eat hearty"...they said it in French, so it sounded much classier, but that was what they said:)  The French was appropriate, because Terri's BF is very French (and not "snooty Parisian, look down his nose" French...He's more "en province', everyone is his friend, can't do enough for you" French:)  I was looking at the sandwiches and then at the salads and then at the crepe irons and I said "can you do crepes for lunch?"  Terri said "Sure" and I was suddenly very happy:)  I was even happier after my egg, goat cheese, basil and tomato crepes...a genuine value for $7.99 and a delightful lunch...warm, soft, savory and filling:)  I'll be keeping SWC in the rotation...I may even try a sandwich now and then:-)

"Just a spoonful of sugar, helps the pizza go down"  I think that little ditty was the kitchen's motto when this place was Nello's, in Old Town...not any more:)  I never really cared for Nello's all that much...just too sweet in the sauce department for my taste...not just the pizza, but pretty much everything they made that used red sauce of any kind.  I'm happy to say that Jac bought this place last week, changed the name and threw away the bags of sugar that must have been littering the kitchen:)  The result is a very much improved, pizza centric, Italian dining experience:)  The Beautiful Carin and I met another couple for dinner at Jac's last evening...a double date...we're feeling social again:)  None of us knew that Nello's had changed hands...we went back and forth with texts to make sure that we were in the right spot...very entertaining:)  But once we were in, it was clear that things had changed...and for the better:)  Carin and I each had a well made vodka martini...for $3.00 a pop...made with decent vodka, too!  We had appetizers...including a very well done bowl of mussels in a vodka sauce that was "lick the bowl" good (although I didn't actually lick the bowl...much like when I was actually dating, Carin tells me that I should be on my best behavior when we are double dating...I don't know why...it's not like we're going home with them...but I was good:)  The new pizza menu at Jac's offers new and interesting artisan options, including the well done "Margherita" and a "Bela Dela Meat" something or other that was wonderful!  These pizza's were savory, well made, smokey from the wood oven and they were huge! :-)  We had two pizza's and ended up taking home almost  1/2 of each pizza:)  A great value at under $80 US money for four of us, including multiple cocktails, two big pizza's and two appetizers:)  Finally, while the décor hasn't changed, the atmosphere has...the cherry on top of the whipped cream was the delightful little jazz combo playing in the corner...at a level that gave us a great background music for our date, yet still let us carry on a conversation (Carin tells me that's a rule of dating...getting to know someone...so many dating rules...I thought I was done with all that...now I find that the rules are doubled for double dates:)  If you still need the sweet red sauce hit, ask them to bring the sugar bowl to the table...otherwise, drop by Jac's and enjoy the marti's and the pizza...oh, and get yourself a bowl of the mussel's...you can thank me when you see me:)

I like to think of myself as a very fair-minded person...almost the embodiment of the word...not "person", "fair"!  I am like a living "Spirit of Justice"...right down to the blindfold, the scales and the toga (exposing  one manly boob).  No one is going to put the peek-a-boo brassiere of prejudice on me (like the Bushies tried to do to the actual Spirit of justice a few years ago)...no siree!  So it was with love for all burgers and objectivity in my heart that I rolled in to The Grind on a couple of warm afternoons, not so very long ago.  And I just wasn't very impressed...the burger wasn't bad by any means...but it wasn't great either...esp. at the price point...unfortunately.  I expected more!  * More burger choices...only three choices on the menu...it's called The Grind...do they only "grind" enough beef for three burger choices? Maybe they will cobble up something else, if you want, but frankly...I'm paying for them to figure the menu out and prepare the food for me...if I want to figure it out myself, I'll stay home and make my own.  * More flavor...I've tried the place twice, burgers both times and the peppercorn burger and the Sweet and Starchy burger (I may have that wrong)...both were...what's the word I'm groping for here...adequate...completely...adequate. I kind of expect a place like this to knock my socks off (if, of course, I were to ever wear socks), but it just doesn't.  * More for my money...it's $16 - $17 for a burger and beverage, by the time I tip...I'm not complaining about the price...I'm complaining about what I get for the price!  * More better service...OK, I know...bad grammar...I should say "better more" service...the joint wasn't exactly jumpin' either time I dropped in and yet getting a beverage and lunch took a long time...a really long time...a 90 minute long time one of the times I was there...How long does it take to undercook a burger on a super duper unique and special "One Million Degree" grill? The burgers should have vaporized in the time it took to get them to the table!  But in fairness to the Grind (always the hallmark of my little Yelp stories), I made sure that I re-tried some of my other favorite burgers...you know...WCG, FEZ, Daily Dose, Modern Burger, Davids, Zinburger, Lucky Boy, even In-n-Out!  OK, you caught me...it was really more of an excuse to go on a burger binge...I do love them so!  At any rate, all of them still measure up quite nicely...and all of them make better burgers than The Grind!  The Grind is certainly nowhere near the bottom of the barrel...the décor is very nice on the inside (although the little old mall at 40th and Camelback is where restaurants go to die...not pleasant from the outside).  The wait staff seem nice enough whenever you get a chance to see them and interact with them (which isn't that often during the course of a lunch, as it turns out)...I don't know if it's a kitchen issue or that the wait staff is "slower than ass end of hard times" (a saying from the depression era...no, the other depression era...although it certainly seems apropos enough these days).  res ipsa loquitur...  So, as I stand in judgment...the very physical embodiment of the Spirit of Justice...my judgment is that The Grind is a 2.75 star experience, and as everyone knows, Justice is blind, favors no one (except the wealthy) and never rounds up...so 2 stars it is.

Allrighty then...  It's time to poke the pig I like to call "Controversy"!  I know it's going to sound like heresy, but I'm just going to come out with it...I like Italian Beef Sandwiches better than Philly Cheesesteaks!  I'll give you a minute to clean up the spit on your screen...there you go...there's still a little to your right...no, right...good, all bright and shiny again!  It's true, I really do!  Not that I don't like cheesesteaks, I just like the full dip Italian Beef (made the right way...the Chicago, stand up at the counter and lean over to keep from getting the drippings on your shoes way), better!  And Al's delivers on the better Italian Beef!  Huge sandwiches, made in every conceivable manner (maybe too many options on the menu, but I suppose someone likes some the of the more esoteric choices), but really, there is only one way to make this sandwich for me...Full Dip, Provolone and hot Giardiniera...chock full of beefy, cheesy, spicy, peppery goodness!  The kind of goodness that mere napkins can't remove...oh sure, they can soak up some of the greasy drips...smear things around on your hands and face a little bit, that sort of thing...but you're going to need a shower after lunch at Al's Beef.  And that's how it should be!  My buddy and I met for lunch last week and we tried the new Al's franchise for the first time.   For first time franchisers (from Chicago, BTW, so they know how these things are supposed to look and taste), they do a nice job...And I should note how nice everyone is at Al's...so...noted!  The service was reasonably good, and while they did forget to put Giardiniera on my sandwich, they were quick to give me a couple of cups of their house blend to fork over onto my sandwich...you just aren't getting the entire experience without the pickled peppers!  My buddy and I sat and talked and the sandwiches quickly disappeared, along with a pretty decently made, tasty side of fries...I know, I know...I can't eat that way every day (or really, every week) if I want to live to a ripe old age of 149...but I'm not sure that I want to live that long if I can't get my Italian Beef sandwich from time to time!  So my new strategy is to extend my life by forgoing  the cheesesteaks and replacing them with Italian Beef, now that we have a couple of decent places in town (sorry DeFalco's...you know I love you, but, for the love of Jebus, dip my sandwich...don't just give me a little plastic "sample cup" of au jus).  Of course, that life extension strategy will only work if the mob doesn't come after me with torches and pitchforks for writing that a good Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich is better than a Philly Cheesesteak!

It's Monday and I am still stuffed...maybe that will resolve itself through the course of the day today...we'll see.  I had clients in town yesterday (and they are friends, as well...always nice to do business with friends:) and they wanted to see the new casino at the 101 and Indian Bend and have brunch...all in all, excellent ideas!  The casino and resort (which has been under construction since I moved to town) have really turned out nicely (at least the portion that is finished...some of the landscaping, pools, finish work inside...well, about 80% of the resort is done...so they have that going for them:) is really very lovely...2 or 3 giant steps ahead of what I expect from a local casino (we aren't in Vegas, after all!).  The important pieces are done...and by important, I mean the pieces that make them money!...the rest of that stuff is just for show.  The casino itself is very nice for a local casino...the restaurants are open and going...they actually serve Peet's coffee here (if you are a Bay Area transplant, you'll know what that means:) and the staff is super accommodating!  We showed up for brunch on Sunday at 11:30 and there was no wait to get a lovely table near the window so we could look down on the construction of what will become a desert nature walk area (probably kind of "Disney" version of desert and native American life...lots a dirt and concrete right now...should be nice when they get it done:)  The dealio seems to be essentially unlimited champagne, bloody mary's, blini's, and mimosa's with brunch...for $25 a head...and given the quality of the food...and the quantity of the food and drink...that's a terrific deal:)  We sat there (well, sat and ate, went and refilled, repeated as directed) for 2 and  1/2 hours...the place wasn't busy and it seemed we had our own wait staff making sure that our drinks were never dry and that dirty plates never piled up...in short, assuring us of a wonderful time:)  I have sampled a few breakfast buffet brunches around town over the past few years, from the Phoenician to the Fairmont to Eagles Nest to the Wrigley (The Beautiful Carin loves no meal quite so much as a Sunday Champagne Buffet Brunch), and I can tell you that this place measures up in every way...and exceeds many of those much more expensive brunches!  * The food is presented so appealingly...on porcelain instead of in steam trays! * Chef's at the ready for any special request (if you don't care for the pizza that is available, they'll make whatever you want...no extra charge:) * Gelato, as well as pastry for your sweet tooth:) * Fresh shucked oysters on the  1/2 shell...on ice...with all the accouterments! * A grill next to the carving station (you want your prime rib with grill marks on it?...no problem:) * You want sushi fresh cut, or a fresh stir-fry for your meal...they whip it up while you wait...wonderful!  The buffet is laid out much like the Wynn in Vegas...tucked behind the massive bar and easily accessible, but not in line of sight, so you can enjoy your meal('s)... without all the clanking, cooking, and other things that often accompany a buffet.  None of that would matter if the food and drinks were crap...but they aren't crap...in fact, the food and cocktails were terrific!  I talked to several of the chefs and told them how really good I thought this place is and they just beamed with pride...they are having a good time and making some good chow and it shows in every bite:)  And for me, the bites kept adding up...I didn't find anything that wasn't tasty (and I ate pretty much everything:)  The good news is that I was wearing my "eatin pants" so I was ok right up to the time we dropped my clients off at their hotel...then it was all I could do to drive home and drag myself to the couch...moaning...in pleasure (no, food pleasure...I couldn't have done anything else:)  Even Carin needed a nap Sunday afternoon (in spite of eating a much "healthier" brunch than I did, with her special request stir-fry and what have you)...those champagnes glasses do add up:)  It looks like Sunday has become "Brunch Day" once again, now that a good one is so close...and so reasonably priced!  Now I just need to figure out a new workout program that will allow me to deal with the extra 12,000 calories every Sunday:)

The Beautiful Carin and I have never been confused with health food enthusiasts.  Nevertheless, in effort to broaden our horizons, we decided to give Nourish a spin at lunch a few weeks ago, and see if it might "change our point of view".  I was a little disappointed, frankly.  But then again, I freely admit that I might be an outlier to their target demographic!  Located in the ruins of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon...I mean the Optima Camelview...the place is definitely going for a hip feel...but it just doesn't quite succeed.  Nourish is just so aggressively healthy...from the colors of the décor to the too eager menu to the very strict tables and chairs and the meager portions...all of them as warm and inviting as a rap on the knuckles from the teacher in the one room schoolhouse where I spent my first few years in the educational system.  The patio, while nice enough, overlooks the desperately deserted inner atrium of the OC on one side, and the street on the other.  We gamely settled into the rock hard and posture correcting chairs (subtly telling us to "sit up straight and eat our veggies...act healthy dammit!") and perused the menu.   We looked and looked and looked, but I couldn't find the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes (which I consider health food) and Carin looked in vain for some of her favorites (or at least some salad dressing that wasn't essentially flavored water).  We start with a shared bowl of "chili"...all I have to say about that "chili", is that it wasn't.  I ordered a "Salmon Burger"...which I (silly me) assumed would constitute salmon and a bun...but when the menu says "served on a bed of greens" they mean "you just get some lettuce under this thingy...no buns".  I suppose that wouldn't have been so bad if they had given me an actual slab of salmon, like I can get at AJ's grill for $3.00 less...but this was a "salmon pattie"...ground up salmon and fillers (bread crumbs, green onion, chopped pepper, and assorted other crap).  Why did they do that to a perfectly good piece of salmon?  Unless of course it wasn't a perfectly good piece of salmon, but a perfectly good can of salmon!  I don't know...it was just fishy...and not in a good way.  At least it was gluten free!  Carin's "Kitchen Sink" salad was also a disappointment...unless by "Kitchen Sink" you mean a small salad consisting almost entirely of sliced peppers, shredded carrot and cucumber, onions and a little bit of romaine, in a small soup bowl...maybe they have a very tiny kitchen and the sink is quite small...I just don't know and I didn't bother to investigate.  The service was perfunctory, but fine (we didn't get a lot of interaction with our server...he was working pretty hard for the attention of the young lady behind the bar, as well as chatting with a couple of his friends who happened to drop by).  The good news for us is that place was essentially empty from the time we showed up (at 12:30 on a pleasant Saturday afternoon) until we left, so we had a waiter all to ourselves (even if his attention was split between us and his potential hook-up).  All-in-all, this little repast cost us about $40...and we walked out of Nourish feeling not so much "nourished" or "nurtured" or "healthy" as we felt "corrected", "admonished" and "hungry".  Oh well, I tried to be healthy...it's just not in my DNA!

It's true!  I haven't been one of Aaron May's biggest fans over the past few years.  Ranging from the mediocre and puzzling "Lodge" to the execrable and gloomy "Over Easy" (and it's lamentable cousin at the skating rink in NoSco)...I just haven't cared much for his offerings...no pizzazz....at least to me (oh sure, I saw the Travel Channel special, too...I know the Sasquatch is gigantic and gooey, but even I have my standards).  But I'm prepared to change my thinking about the AM empire, all because of a few small plates of food...tapas...done the way tapas should be done!  I wanted to stand up and applaud after my first few bites of the first plates to reach our table last night!  But The Beautiful Carin was nibbling my ear and murmuring about love, the wine, the food, the warm night and the mood and well...standing up and applauding would have been embarrassing!  So we sat there and snuggled in our little booth-like corner on the patio for a couple of hours and had a number of marvelous small plates and a couple of glasses of excellent wine and thought "How very, completely civilized!"  And, then we thought, "Why haven't we been back to Espana, lately?"...Well, why bother with the flight when Iruna is within walking distance!  Spend the airfare on tapas and wine!  Iruna is a marvelous little Tapas bar that would be right at home in Malaga on the Costa del Sol...no kidding!  From the communal bar/table to the walled patio to the colors and the lighting, somebody got the décor just right!  And Iruna got the menu right, too!  Crispy Chicken with garlic and pickled onions; shaved ham, quince and cheese cold plates; spicy scampi with a soothing aioli and chilled asparagus with spicy romesco all hit just the right note...well thought out and well executed dishes...satisfying, tasty and delightful!  We even had room for a little dessert!  We shared (so sweetly intimate) some sort of chocolate/vanilla crème pudding with orange liqueur and dark chocolate sauce...decadent and the perfect accompaniment to the very solid selection of available porto's  (I really did feel like I was back on the Iberian Peninsula for a while last night).  While we didn't hit the bar too hard last evening, we did glance through the selection of single malts (a big "hello" to Mac and all the Glen's) and took note of the decent selection of brandies, cognac's and bourbons  (and for my buddy Brian...Blanton's, Woodford's Reserve and Rowan Creek are on the menu, too).  After a busy week and a hectic Friday, it is hard to imagine a much better way to spend a warm Friday evening than a leisurely and sensual dinner of tapas and wine with the girl of my dreams, followed by a slow stroll home and...

When I played high school football (back when the universe was still expanding and the earth was cooling) we never had any cool things to shout at the line of scrimmage ("hut 1, hut 2, HIKE" was about it).  Then I would run 30 yards and my rag armed quarterback would under throw me by 10 yards or throw the ball 5 yards behind me and I would get hit by someone in a different colored uniform...such good memories!  These days football players get to holler things at each other like "BLUE 32" (blue being the live "color" of the play and 32 being the number of the play...if you hollered "RED 32" your team would know you were trying to fool your opponent...see, 'cause RED wasn't the live color...OK too much football trivia for one afternoon).  This Blue 32 is not trying to fool anyone...it's a straight ahead, upscale, well executed and thoroughly delightful sports bar (see why I went into the discourse about the nomenclature...it's a very sporty name)!  The place is still so new that it smells a little like wood stain and concrete, but not too much to be off-putting...and when the food comes, that is all you are going to smell anyway!  I was looking for a healthy choice for lunch today and I thought, "well, sports are healthy, right?"  So I dropped in and sat at the counter so I could look over the scotch selection while I had lunch and see if this a place that I want to come back to (so very important in this day and age of so many sports bars) and I was thrilled to see that Blue 32 stocks most of my favorite single malts (along with a metric ton of beers and wine)...Yummy!  I looked over the menu, and while I was pleased to see old favorites (Hi Hamburgers!...How you doin' French dip!) I couldn't believe my poor old eyes when I saw both a Monte Cristo and Shrimp Po' Boy on the menu!  Now that's health food!  I quickly ordered up a Monte Cristo and I was rewarded with one of the better MC sandwiches I've had!  This bad boy was chock full of ham, turkey, cheddar cheese, mayo on three slices of hearty wheat flat bread...then the genius of a Monte Cristo is that they drench that rascal in egg batter and deep fry it crispy and golden brown, and then sprinkle powdered sugar all over it!  The other genius of the sandwich is that they serve it with Strawberry Jam and you get to dip your MC in the jam as you eat it!  The sandwich is all hot and gooey and sweet and savory...holy crap was that good!  Add a pickle and a heapin' helpin' o' crispy fries and you've got a healthy and tasty (OK, tasty) lunch for your $8.99!  This place is very nicely decorated and the servers all seem to be very good and up to speed on serving...no glitches...everybody was smiling and seemed happy to be there!  I know, it's only my first visit...but this place has earned a spot in the regular lunchtime rotation and my go to healthy eating option!

Aloha!  It's been a couple of years since the Beautiful Carin and I took one of our vacations in the islands.  Clearly, it's time to go back and "Hang Ten" (I told Carin I could "Hang Ten" when we first met, to get her to like me...by the time she found out I couldn't surf, she had fallen in love with me for my mind).  Since we were on Maui last, it looks like they've invented an entirely new hot dog...the Maui Dog!  Well, maybe not "invented" so much as "enhanced" the good old "Pooka" dogs that you find in the islands.  "Maui Enhancement"?  OK, I don't know for sure that these bad boys (and since hot dogs are wiener related, I think it's safe to assume that they are boys) originated on Maui, but wherever and whatever fertile imagination created them deserves a hand-y!  But we have always preferred Maui, when we visit the islands..."Maui No Ka Oi"...now, I guess I can add "Maui Dog No Ka Oi"  I've seen a few reviews for Maui Dog on Yelp, lately...and I was watching Hawaii 5-0 http://tinyurl.com/yazfcs5 on the TiVo last night and that pretty much decided my lunch plans today (It's sweet of you to worry about my health but don't...I detoxed like crazy this morning, so I was ready and able to handle the nitrate/salt/fat onslaught at lunch today).  I strolled in and looked over the menu...and I was momentarily confused (a hazard that us seasoned citizens learn to deal with by yelling at those younger than us, in an effort to confuse everybody and not feel out of place).  The very nice proprietor came to my aid, briefly explained the workings of the menu, and off I went!  I selected wisely and soon I felt like I was back in the islands noshing a tasty and satisfying Spam slider (Spam = Scientifically Processed Animal Material...I know, more for me)...so very, very tasty!  I was also the proud possessor of a very satisfying Maui Dog!  They started my Maui Dog with a nice big, beefy wiener (that's what she said!) and they put plenty of toppings on him...Spicy Maui Mustard (sadly, mayonnaise on the wiener just doesn't work for me) along with a sort of mango topping and dill spears...Maui Waui!  The sweetness, the spiciness, the saltiness, the grilled flavor of the wiener...all coming through for a first rate Maui Dog experience!  I know, seems like an awful lot of stuff happening on the Maui Dog, but somehow, it all worked for me...I haven't really been a fan of overly dressed wieners in the past, but these guys could change my point of view...a little, at any rate!  So, I now have a Maui Dog "mahalo" card (no it doesn't mean "trash" in Hawaiian...it means "Thank You") and I plan to use that rascal whenever I'm back in town.  That Maui Dog was delicious...good to the last drop!  Aloha!

Beaver Choice?  Uh...Yes, Please!  I thought it was a question...a natural mistake.  You see, I love Beavers...after all, I come from Oregon, the Beaver State (state motto - "M'mmmmm, that's some mighty tasty Beaver") and I have spent so many years pursuing Beavers, frolicking with Beavers, really, just delighting in Beavers in all their many guises!  I have stalked, trapped and released back into the wild...(I'm a conservationist) more Beavers than I can count...from adorable Golden Beavers and the elusive California Shaved Beaver to the wild and wily Crimson "Fire" Beaver...I guess you could say that I am Beaver enthusiast!  The Beautiful Carin put an end to my halcyon days of hunting wild Beavers...really, I'm much happier for it...and calmer.  That said, I was going to drop by Ted's for a wiener at lunch and saw the sign for this adorable little place (I personally think that it's no coincidence that Beaver Choice occupies a cozy little spot very near Ted's Wiener Emporium), and I thought, "Donald, let's go get us some Beaver".  Well, it turns out that Beaver Choice is a terrific little Scandinavian restaurant...for Scandinavians...like me!  As I looked over the menu, I saw things I hadn't seen since I was a kid...things I hadn't seen since I was last at that great Smorgasbord place back in Portland that I can't remember the name of...the stuff that Nordic dreams are made of!  Gravlax, Kåldolmar, Laxpudding, Fylld Lövbiff...and fries!  I had a smoked salmon sandwich that was well made, tasty and filling (oh, don't worry...I didn't upset the subtle forces of nature by eating too healthily...I had fries, too!).  While they do have several vegetarian options on the lunch menu, I would remind you that the sweet little family that owns and operates Beaver Choice is Swedish (by way of Poland)...Scandahoovian...like me...and we never met a vegetable or fruit that we didn't think was better boiled, fried, baked, distilled or fermented...just sayin.  But I am going back...the only thing better would be if these guys would open up a smorgasbord place...but then they would have to contend with me pretty much wallowing in the buffet tables...and nobody wants to see that.  Drop by Beaver Choice the next time you are in that part of the world!  Even if you're not a Beaver Enthusiast (like I am), I'm sure you'll find something to eat.

Do you know what I look like on the inside?  Neither did my doc (no, my doc is not one of my squash buddies...why would I let one of my squash buddy doc's gain an unfair advantage by figuring out my weaknesses, medically speaking?).  But, as part of my annual physical (which I have administered every 4 years, whether I need it or not), I was directed to Insight Imaging for a set of x-rays so we can see if I have any x-ray detectable maladies...Sweet Jebus, I hope not!  And Insight Imaging...such a cute play on words, really...get it?...In sight?...I don't know...I giggled.  OK...  At any rate, I was a "walk-in" after the first part of my physical this morning and the nice people at Insight got me through the process for my x-rays in pretty short order...about 30 minutes from the time I walked in until I walked out, thoroughly irradiated and "glowing".  Easy Squeezey!  And now it's on to the rest of my physical (which has turned, as I've grown older, from the doc looking at me and saying "you look healthy to me", into a multi-day ordeal)...crap!  And speaking of "crap", my doc was kind enough to schedule my colonoscopy for about 3 weeks from now...as the last item in the extensive "Donald S." physical examination torture list.  I think the colonoscopy is just a ploy, frankly...because my doc IS one of my golf buddies and having 15' of cold steel "inserted' is bound to have an effect on my golf swing...possibly not a good effect!  On the positive side, I'll have some peace of mind that I'm still the healthy specimen that I've always been...and I friggin' guarantee that I will keep my back straight and my head still when I swing a golf club after this particular "procedure"!

The Hippies thought they could fool me...the Hippies thought I wouldn't see their little trick with the profile change.  I haven't been stoned in a very long time...I pay attention!  So, since the hippies were good enough to change their Yelp profile to avoid these previous reviews, I think I'll post this one under the new profile. ________________________________________________________  A friend of mine called  and said "let's have lunch!"  He seemed so excited...and then he said "hey, buddy...there's a brand new Two Hippies near Old Town!"  I threw up in my mouth a little and said "but I don't think these Two Hippies joints are very good"  He promised this time the experience would be better!  He's a lying sack of...well, you get my drift.  I went anyway and had essentially the identical experience to my last (and I do hope this is my last) experience with the Two Hippies.  Not surprising that this place is identical...the very same franchisee operates it (in the location once occupied by the late,and not apparently lamented in the slightest, Desert Dogs and Dessert), that operates the other Two Hippies Joints that I've tried.  Two Hippies is recycling the very same thing over and over!  Oh well.  And except for the actual physical location and the fact that I had a pretty flavorless burrito instead of tacos, recycling the same review that I used before works stunningly well for this location, too!  And it's appropriate since Two Hippies seems intent on recycling their formula, ad nauseum.  Very "green" of them (except of course for the styro and plastic everything else).  Plus, I'm feeling lazy today (or green...I can't remember which).  Here is the review, for those of you still reading:  "I was out running a couple of errands last week and a friend called and suggested lunch at Two Outraged Hippies Taco's and Beach something:)  I hadn't been to a Two Hippies for a couple of years...I think it was their burger joint...that one didn't make much of an impression on me either way :-I  But I thought to myself...well, I like lunch:)  And, I like taco's:)  And I was a hippie of the first water back in my day (which, BTW, means that it's no longer "My Day", sadly:(  But I'm not thrilled by Two Hippies taco's:(  I got dos taco's...a chicken and a carne asada, along with a can of soda pop...the people taking my $5.00 cash were very nice (and they were trying to dress up like hippies or something, too!...too adorable for words:)  I didn't get fish taco's...experience (the kind gained through trial and many, many errors)...has taught me that the only place that I really like to get fish tacos, is from one of the beach palapa's in Bahia de Navidad...where the panga's pull right up on the sand...the fishermen jump out and hand the cook in the palapa a red snapper or dorado or something else with fins...they clean it, cut it up, grill it, throw some lettuce and homemade salsa on it and it's a taco about 30 minutes after it quit swimming:)  Those are pretty good fish taco's...esp. washed down with a cerveza or three:)...I don't remember the name of the place...probably "taco de playa" or something...just walk down the beach...you can't miss it:)  10 pesos each for the taco's, 25 pesos a pop for the cerveza...it's a very good deal:)...BTW, that doesn't include round-trip first class airfare or the Governors Suite at the Grand Bay:)  No beach at 5th and Camelback:(  But, I digress:)  I liked the service and the price (and I really appreciate the staff trying to look like hippies for me...really...a blast from past:)  I really didn't care for the food, itself...outrageous has a number of different connotations, depending on context...but I didn't find the taco's "outrageous" in any sense of the word:)  Although nowhere near as bad as Skip & Jan's attempt at taco's, the hippies taco's leave more than a bit to be desired...the carne asada was dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they give you in the little plastic cups didn't really improve things.  So I tried the chicken taco and found it to be dry, stringy, bland, and the salsa they gave...!  Hey wait a minute...did they just give me two of the same thing and try to call them something different?!?!?...  That would be so like the hippies I knew back in the `60's and `70's:-)...always stoned, never quite sure what they were doing...so much fun to watch:)  But no, they gave me carne asada and chicken...the taco's just looked and tasted very much alike (the chicken was somewhat whiter, but other than that...not much difference:(  In Phoenix, a city with so many options for getting my taco fix, even the nostalgia for times long gone (and thankfully so...can you imagine a world in which all we want to do is sit around all day, get high, and make love...not war...where would we all be? :-) can't make up for these lackluster offerings:(  There are tons of better taco shop's...many of which don't even require the plane ride and hotel stay:)"

Hooray for Friends and Family night!  Great grub, great company, great smells, great space!  The pizza was terrific, the scotch was a delight and the onion rings and fries are wonderfully crispy and soft at the same time...hard to do.  I had the roasted chicken after making a pig of myself on the testing/tasting stuff!  Go...just trust me this once!

It was moving day for my lovely daughter, Whitney on Sunday and 2 stops at QT (once to gas up my car and once to gas up the U-Haul, as well as getting refreshing, ice cold beverages!) reminded me that I have not reviewed QT! Accordingly, this review is for all of the QT's out there. Convenience store/gas stations seem to be a necessary evil in life today.  I have, like all of you, bought gas at the Diamond Shamrocks, Circle K's, 7/11's and all of that. So, when I need gas these days, in the greater Phoenix area, I set my nav to find the closest QT. I will, in fact, go a few miles out of my way to patronize these smiling and pleasant guys and gals! Why? Well, aside from the price aspect (I find that QT's gas prices are very competitive with with the lowest prices in any given area), there is a noticeable difference in attitude of the employees at QT and that carries into everything they do. I understand that they pay their employees pretty well and incent them on things that matter to customers. All the locations also seem to have a noticeable lack of people outside sitting on trash cans, waiting by the pay phone or sitting on the walk outside the store, waiting for...something. The locations are universally clean, they don't smell, the quality of the gasoline is good (no pings or complaints from car!), the restrooms are clean and the beverage area is generally clean, non-sticky, with a big selection of drinks (OK, I am creature of habit and generally get the same old caffeine free diet coke, but I see people spend a great deal of time and effort "mixing" various soft drinks and flavors in a effort to get just the right sort of concoction).  I haven't had any of their food ( I can't bring myself to believe that a sandwich made at 3:00 am is really "fresh made", or that a hot dog cooked under a 100 watt bulb and sitting where anybody can touch it, fondle it, spit on it, etc., won't give me herpes), but QT is great for the occasional apple, banana, coke, cup of coffee and gas.

I really like Quik Trip...I go out of my way to find a QT to gas up, get my beverage (and may I say that they keep their restrooms clean and usable, in spite of the tremendous odds against them:)  So I really like QT's...all of them:)  That said, I got a very nice note from a fellow Yelper (who works for QT, BTW:)  He read my last review and he mentioned that I should really try the sandwiches and hot dogs before giving them short shrift (I think I mentioned that I believed the sandwiches are made at 3:00 am and that the hot dogs were cooked under a 100 watt bulb and were similarly aged:-)  I might have been guilty of using poetic license (although in my defense...I didn't say I had actually eaten one of these...just that I wasn't in any hurry to try them:)  Well, that's changed...I drifted (truly...a four wheel drift that ended with me "bootleg parking" my car next to pump #11 to fuel up...very stylish:)  I headed into the always clean and bright QT to grab a refreshing beverage and as I walked by the hot dogs and brats rolling on the rollers, I said to myself..."it's pretty close to noon, let's see what these guys have got"  I picked up a Turkey Sandwich and hot dog (I figured, "why not go all the way...if this stuff is going to hurt me, I might as well get over with":)  But QT didn't hurt me...in fact, the sandwich was pretty decent (certainly better than some that I've paid far more for)...the bread seemed fresh, as were the rest of the ingredients (pretty typical, turkey, lettuce, tomato, mayo, etc.:)...it didn't seem that this sandwich was sitting wrapped in plastic like a typical AM/PM or Sky Harbor sandwich...my new Yelp/QT buddy didn't steer me wrong on that one:)  On to the hot dog...well...I didn't get a bum steer on the hot dog, either:)  My touch point for these kinds hot dogs (parking lot dogs?) are the dogs you can generally buy at Home Depot (depot dogs?)  The QT dog was as good as anything I've found at the Home Depot...maybe better, certainly more options (brats, cheddar brats, etc.) and plenty of condiments and a nice place to prepare my dog for battle:)  My only remaining issue is the same issue that I have with any buffet set up...when I see people rooting around for that special dog all the way in back and strectttccccchhhhiiiiinnngg out over the hot rollers...well, I just get the shudders:(  But that's not something I can lay at QT's doorstep...they do a great job of keeping things sweet and clean...they keep an eye on the rollers and the stretchers...I just tried not to think about as I had my dog:)  Finally, a word about the gasoline...I'm firm believer that that you shouldn't have to worry about picking large bugs and rodent "parts" out of your fuel filter...even when you are buying inexpensive gasoline:)  QT's gas has been consistently higher in quality than other stations products (I had a $200 bill for cleaning this kind of "debris" out of the gas lines of one of my Lexus' after a gas purchase from Diamond Shamrock a few years ago)...QT might be a penny or two more than the cheapest, but quality is important, too! :-)  When you need to fuel up (and by "you", I mean your car and you), you can sure do worse than dropping by the nearest QT:)
