This place is TERRIBLE. Went last night with a group of 10 people and we had 2 servers, so you think we would get amazing service, right? Farrrr from it. The server messed up the drink order on 3 peoples drinks,twice. The salad was absolutely drenched in dressing. The filet that i ordered medium came out fully well done. We all ordered a second round of drinks as we gave our food orders. Most specifically choosing their drink to be able to pair it with their food. Well 40 minutes later, well after we had finished eating, our drinks came. I kid you not. 40 MINUTES for drinks! And we kept on trying to get the attention of EITHER of our servers, and they continuously ignored our whole table. Then when the check came (we were going to order dessert and coffees, but realized it could take a whole hour to get that-so declined) then and only then did our server apologize. And of course he said "oh we are super busy, so the kitchen and bar have been backed up all night". Not once did he admit any of the blame was his. I've worked in restaurants before, and NEVER should a round of drinks (that were ordered at the same time as the meal) take 40 minutes. We also never had our water refilled, after asking multiple times, and being there for a solid 2 hours. This place is terrible all around. NEVER will we go back. Save yourself the money and waste of time.

I personally am I huge fan of Modern Manor! Every time i've gone I have gotten amazing service. The pieces there are so fun and unique. I have dealt with all the owners there and honestly it has always been a great experience. Between the amazing furniture and knick-knacks, and the great owners ,the place really makes you feel at home. Also, the rate that they turnover pieces there is CRAZY! If you see something you like when you first go, i recommend getting it right away- because I have waited before and things have gotten purchased by others! I I highly recommend this store to anyone looking for mid-century modern furniture.

My husband and I bought our first home back in 2009 in Phoenix. John was incredibly helpful throughout the whole process, especially for us first time buyers that had a million and one questions. He knew the areas that we were interested in extremely well, and was always willing to go to as many homes as we were interested in. We have recommend John to many friends and family, and everyone has had the same glowing remarks about him. Without a doubt he is the only realtor we will ever use!
