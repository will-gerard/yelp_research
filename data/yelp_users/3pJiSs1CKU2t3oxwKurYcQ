I am grateful that AZ can see Broadway shows at Gammage. However, I have to give the theater 1 star due to the bathroom situation for the ladies.   Why? 1. Each row can be up to 160 seats, with no break in the center for exits. If you need to excuse yourself, you'd have to climb over 80 people in the dark. I'll wait until intermission. 2. The intermission ladies room lines are incredibly long. Little girls were crying, and their moms were desperate. It is stressful. 3. You wait in line and are told by monitors that there's a shorter wait on another floor. You go there, and it's worse. You come back and now that line is worse. You're told there's a shorter line at another bathroom. Don't fall for it, all of lines are long.  4. There is no wait for the men's room, none. They have a monitor that won't let the ladies in. It's HUMILIATING.  5. Once you get to use the bathroom, the bells have rung to end intermission. You will have to wait 10 minutes into the act and then climb over 80 irritated people in the dark. Collect yourself and enjoy the second half of the show.   Solution: Long term-Obviously, build more bathrooms   Immediate solution -If there's no line for the men's room, let the ladies in!    I support the arts in Tempe. Please let us enjoy the show.

No lines and a beautiful airport. That gets 2 stars. Tonight a female TSA agent at D gates/TSA pre-check was downright rude. I politely asked for a bin for my phone and watch. She smirked, shook her head, and snapped "there are no bins in pre-check!" She said it like I was a complete idiot. No reason to be rude. I know what I'm doing. Shame on TSA for being rude. It's not necessary.

You need to go to Lobster Me. Please eat there. I want this place to be here for years to come. This spot is one of my favorite things about Vegas.   Pros: 1. Best lobster roll I've had. Ever, ever...ever-ever!           2. Great friendly customer service.            3. Super quick. You have your meal in minutes.  Tips:  1. You will spend around $18 for a lobster roll and homemade potato chips.             2. It's in the food court of the Planet Hollywood Mall.              3. They have both Maine and Connecticut style lobster rolls.

Today I had the pleasure of meeting Kristy for a Brazilian blowout. The person that usually did mine cancelled my appointment and I really needed a BB. I liked Kristy's reviews on Yelp and gave her a call. This was my 3rd Brazilian and she was by far the most precise and talented. Kristy is a true Brazilian blowout pro!   I'm giving Kristy 5 stars. Here's some reasons why I will go back:  1. Great communication. She answered all of my questions about the Brazilian blowout. She knows her stuff!  2. Location. Her studio is a very clean, quiet and a pleasant place to be.  3. Expertise. She does more Brazilian blowouts than just about anyone. She doesn't just do them a few times a month. She's got it down.  4. Product. Kristy uses the real stuff.   It can be scary to trust your hair to someone new. You shouldn't pick just anyone to do a Brazilian blowout, pick and expert like Kristy!
