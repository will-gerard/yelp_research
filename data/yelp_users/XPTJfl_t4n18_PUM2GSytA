Came here because my niece was having her baby girl on june 4th. All of the nurses were very accomodating and nice in the delivery room. Especially this one nurse whose name is Jerri. She was the nicest and sweetest of all the nurses. She was very experienced as you can tell she has been doing her job for a very long time. But she also seemed like she still loves what she does a great deal. She put my niece very much at ease during and after the pregnancy. The hospital wasn't a madhouse either which is good. Everyone was very professional yet very flexible at the same time. Everybody who was not in the delivery room had to go into the waiting room. I snuck back in and put my ear to the door so I could hear the delivery and they never said anything. And there was a big sign next to my head that said "go to the waiting room. no waiting allowed in the halls" The only thing I didn't like was they didn't have little mitts for the babies hands to prevent her from scratching her eyes which she did a couple times. Had to run to the store afterwards to go get some. But besides that Banner Thunderbird is a very well operated hospital. And the cafeteria got some pretty good stuff.

Trying to explain Char's in words cannot do it justice. It might not look like much on the outside. But the inside is always jumping and its probably the best place to go on a Saturday night if u love live music. What I love most about Char's is it reminds me of a old blues club that u would see in the south. The other thing I love and makes Char's stands out from the rest is the crowd. Unlike other clubs out here in AZ in areas like Snottsdale aka Scottsdale or some clubs at Westgate. Where everyone is too cool to really get down and dance cause there all about status so they only stick with a certain kind and try to front like their all that. Char's is the opposite. At Char's it truly is all about the music. When certain songs come on everybody justs grabs somebody and gets on the dance floor to shake their baby making areas. You will see young dancing with really old people, different races dancing with each other, snooty looking people dancing with laid back people. Pretty much people u wouldn't expect dancing with each other do at Char's. The live bands that play there are great. As long as u don't knock their stuff over they don't care how close u get. And they might even dance with u during a song. Char's is a place if u go once you will no doubt tell your friends and bring them back. Everyone should go experience the magic of Char's

Havent been to this mall in awhile. This mall is a shell of what it use to be. Its pretty much a indoor swap meet these days. Im honestly surprise its still in business. The only good thing about it is they have quite a bit of shoe stores than most malls.

The food is great. But the one thing that keeps calling me back to this place is those damn dinner rolls with the spread that's served on the side. I've gone in there and ordered those to go just by themselves. Damn you dinner rolls! Why can't I ever resist your warm yeasty goodness?!

This place is the perfect example of don't judge a book by its cover. The area might not be the greatest but make no mistake about it. This place has the best greek food. Ive passed by this place for years and I never even knew it was there. My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 3 years ago and ive been hooked ever since. And I get the Gyro sandwich every time and its the best. Tried a new shrimp dish last night that was topped with Feta cheese and I think I saw GOD! Bottom line go check this place out. If u don't like it then ill give u my address and you can stop by and slap me for the bad recommendation.

Heard alot about the deep dish from Vito's so I thought I would try it out. You know that tingling feeling u get in your special places when u ride a roller coaster and u take that first huge dip? That's how I felt when I took my first bite of their deep dish. It was that good. I will no doubt be going there again.

The night i went to this was on a saturday and it was a old crowd. If that's how it is on a Saturday night. Then that's probably the norm for that place. It's not a bad place to go to if you wanna find a cougar or a milf. Or a sugardaddy for you ladies out there. (or men, However you get down). I did like the live band that was playing there, Party Mcfly. Nice Back to the Future play on words.

I never heard of FEZ before.  But I sure can't forget about it now!  I was introduced this place about 2 weeks ago by a special lady in my life.  She had never been there either at the time, so It was a first for both of us.  WE WAS GOING ON A ADVENTURE! (I'm sorry, if you saw The Hobbit last year you'll get that joke.)  First of all I love the clean look of the place. My girlfriend always gives me a hard time for enjoying the look and ambiance of a place.  But who doesn't like to eat in a nice looking place?  It's why dining areas are made for eating and bathrooms are made for shhh.... You know what I mean.  But like I was saying the look was great, very clean and modern.  This isn't the usual kind of place you find out here and Phoenix. Both me and my girlfriend felt like we was in California or NY. The service was great as well. We were helped by 3 different people within 10 minutes of being seated.  And it was a packed house on a Friday night.  I can't remember what I had exactly. I know it was a burger and it was very good. But what stole the show for me was the sweet potato fries.  Most places I've had sweet potato fries at they overcook them. They're all hard and taste burnt to me. But the ones at FEZ turned me into Goldilocks, cause they were just right! They had plenty of flavor and were just soft enough to where they wasn't mushy, and cooked enough to where they wasn't hard. They were so good that my lady and I went back to FEZ that very next morning to have brunch. Where I had a breakfast pasta and my girl had a egg white omelet, with a couple of Mimosa's and a side of those sweet potato fries each.  I love my girlfriend dearly, but she's not eating none of my fries.  I will definitely go there again as they seem to have a lot of other good dishes on the menu i would like to try out. I had to give it 4 stars cause parking is not the greatest. But that is nitpicking. Overall it was a damn fine dining experience.

I love Matt's big breakfast. I don't go there all the time. But any place that makes me drive a pretty good distance and wait in line just for breakfast! Must be doing something right. Went there this morning with my girlfriend. And we was greeted by a cute and very intelligent kid that was the owners son. Didn't have to wait to long but it was a nice day. I always get the griddlecakes when I go there. Ive never had anything even close to there's anywhere else. I can't give it 5 stars because of the wait and because its pretty small in there. And its always kind of weird eating breakfast next to a big window where people who are waiting outside can sit there and stare at you. I feel like im on display at a zoo eating. But those are minor gripes. I go to Matts for the food and the food never disappoints.

For as long as I've lived here. I've never hiked this mountain. And now that I have, I'm looking forward to going again.   We went on a Friday morning and it wasn't that bad. Parking was a issue at some of the trials like the summit. We found a spot at the Mojave trial. And for a easy trail you get a good workout. Some of parts can be quite steep and rocks can come loose. I threw a few over and out of the way of the trail so no one would slip.   People there tend to be pretty friendly. We ran into a guy once we reached the top and he gave us advice on a different route we could take on the way down. Then we ran into him again from the opposite direction and he still let us know the way to go. Very nice guy.  And the view is a beautiful site. I could've sat there for hours and just took in the views of the city. I would like to try some of the other trails when parking isn't as bad. And go in the evening to see the sunset. I'm very happy I decided to switch things up from a normal workout routine and take the time to drive here. It was worth it.

I was looking for a nice place to take my girlfriend for her 28th birthday on April 25th. She loves seafood so after reading all the reviews about Wildfish I thought I would give it shot. The place is everything that people said in the other reviews. It is a pretty fancy place but not snooty. I would've gave this place 5 stars, but they didn't give my girlfriend the free sushi roll that I heard about. Even though there was a table right next to us also celebrating a birthday and she got it. But they did give my girlfriend a free desert. The food was some of the best seafood ive ever had in AZ. the bacon wrap shrimp we had for an appetizer exploded with flavor the moment it hits your tongue. I had the Louisiana red fish with a light chive butter sauce. The whole meal was just right, not heavy or oily at all. Had it with the mac & cheese truffle that also was really good. I had to growl at my girlfriend when she tried to sneak a bite. She had the crab stuff shrimp and a twice baked potato. She kept going on about how good it was. For desert we got the pineapple upside down cake everyone raved about. And it didn't disappoint. I let my girl take the first bite since she was the birthday girl and when she took that first bite. She made a orgasmic face that made me kind of jealous lol. But when I took a bite I knew why she made it lol. We will definitely be going back there in the future. Expect to pay about $50 minimum per person. And try to make alittle crumby mess on the table. The waiter has a little thing called a crumber that he uses to scrape up the crumbs. My girl and I got a laugh out of it. The only negative I would give would be that the waiters came by alittle too frequently for our taste that we didn't get a chance to really enjoy our dinner before they came around again and again. Shout out to the people next to us who also had a birthday that same day. And when they found out it was my girls birthday the whole table sang her happy birthday. Very nice of them to do that.

Been here twice in alittle over a month. My girl favorite cake is German Chocolate so I took her there just for that on Valentine's day after we had dinner someplace else. She loved it and said it's probably the best German Chocolate she's had. So we went back there again today and we had just the cake again. She still said its the best she's had and I have to agree its very moist and just sweet enough. And they actually give u a good slice for the price compared to other places that give u a tiny sliver. One of these days we are going to actually have to try the food there. But for now whenever we want some German Chocolate Cake. This is our spot.

Always heard about The Lost Leaf but never got around to going there. Last night went to go check out my friend DJ Gabo do his thing and play some good reegae beats. Had a hard time finding the place at first cause it was around 9 and it was too dark to read the sign. The place is pretty much a house so its easy to get lost as your expecting more of a business looking place. Once I found it and walked in I was surprised by the size on the inside. It didn't look that big on the outside but it can fit a good amount of people. They weren't lying when talking about the amount of beers there as the selection was huge. I only had a few and I don't remember the names except for the PBR I had. The art on the wall was cool. I dug the vibe of the place and everyone there was having a good time. I will definitely be going to this place again. And if u haven't been yet then I suggest u go. Especially on First Fridays.

As many times as ive been to the Breadfruit im surprise I haven't written a review for it yet. This is my favorite restaurant to go to. You can find me and my girlfriend there at least once a month as we both enjoy the place very much. I enjoy the look of the place alot. Its not big and fancy. Hell, you could easily pass right by it and not even notice its there. But that all adds to the charm of The Breadfruit and makes it seem like its a secret place that only you and whoever you are dining with knows about. Its also a romantic place for a date. The paintings on the wall are for sale. It can get a bit loud when it gets filled only because the place is small. But that's a minor gripe. When my girlfriend and I go she gets the brown stew chicken. I get either the curry chicken and dumplings or the jerk chicken, and I don't even like spicy food that much. But the jerk chicken is so good I love it. quote me on what im about to say. THE BREADFRUIT HAS SOME OF THE BEST AND STRONGEST DRINKS! I love their drinks there because they are never watered down. The first sip of your drink may seem pretty overwhelming. But don't worry, its just the alcohol telling your tastebuds to wake the hell up! The drinks are smooth and very tasty and you just taste a hint of alcohol in the drink even though they put alot in them. Which ive always thought was good when the alcohol doesn't overpower the taste of the drink. The Dark & Stormy regular or the Dark & Stormy 151 are my drink of choice, highly recommend either one of those. One more thing. Whatever you order make sure you get a side of festival bread. I don't care if your meal already comes with it, order a side anyway. Its very delicious bread. A dinner for a couple averages between $40-$60 if u just get dinner and a couple drinks. But if you just get dinner and no drinks, then its between $20-$30.

I liked to frequent this Harkins more than most in the valley cause it still seems tucked away to me. The shopping center that its located in is not very big by any means. And with Westgate a mile down the road with expensive ass AMC. You can just drive up the road to this Harkins and see the same movie for a little cheaper. It does get crowded but what movie theater doesn't get crowded on the weekends? But I never find the crowd to overwhelming. And despite it being crowded getting in and out of the parking lot or shopping center for that matter is a breeze. And its literally right off the freeway so your never really stuck in traffic.

Is it possible to cheat on your girlfriend with a burger? Every time I come here I get a bacon double butter burger. And its one of the best burgers I've ever had. Once I take that first bite I never put it down until the last. I keep it so close to my face it probably looks like im making out with it. And when im done I feel satisfied, yet guilty lol.

Ive gone here for years and its still a great theater to see movies. They do have 30 screens. But some of them are damn near the size of a closet. But the 4 colossus theaters they got are huge with plenty of leg room unlike some of the newer theaters. Good place to go see movies in IMAX too. Better than some of the others that offer it. The only gripe about AMC is they use to have the cheaper tickets and they use to have student discounts. But now they charge about $10 per person at night and weekends. Try to go during the week in the afternoon when its only $5  per person.

If you clicked on this review. I know you aren't expecting a night of fine dining. It's CiCi's pizza for crying out loud! There are much better pizza joints in the valley. The pizza there isn't much different then pizza you can get at the store. Its not going to knock your socks off by any means. Plus side, it is a buffet. It's a good place to take the kids after school so they can pig out on pizza on the cheap. Even if it is a bootleg version of Peter Piper and Chuck E. Cheese. And really u should only go in there if you have a kid. If I see a grown ass man in there by himself eating pizza. Im going to be wondering if he's in violation of his parole/probation if you know what I mean. And if I see a couple in there on a date. Then im going to guess whoever thought of going to that place for a date. Is planning on dumping the person they asked.

I have been going to Ocean Blue since it first opened. I have always enjoyed the yogurt, and thinks it tastes pretty good. I like all the toppings and I like how almost every time I go in there the flavors r different. Whenever I go to Westgate whether solo or with my girlfriend. I usually always make sure to hit up Ocean Blue before I leave or sometimes i'll just go to Westgate just for the yogurt.

My girlfriend and I went here as part of our date 2 weeks ago. Heard a few things about the place and read the reviews so I thought we would check it out. Based on the area of Scottsdale it was in. I was expecting a club/restaurant looking place with people all sitting at a bar eating alcoholic ice cream being douches and pretending like they've known about this place from the very beginning. But I was pleasantly surprised to see next to all the fancy expensive restaurants, a small little ice cream shop that you wouldn't think would serve alcoholic ice cream. Made me think they could be smuggling fire arms and drug trafficking as well and who would know cause the place seems so innocent (calm down ATF and Sheriff Joe. just making a joke). The lady who runs the place is real nice and was informative right off the bat when she saw us. I got the Tiramisu/brandy and I can't remember what my girl got but it was just as good. The lady seemed very appreciative of our business which was nice to see considering im sure she's doing great business and could be a ass if she wanted. Im sure the next time im on that side of town I will make the trip over there. The only thing I wish is that the scoops were a bit more. But im just being greedy. The amount they give you is a good portion if you go there after dinner for dessert. For both my girl and i spent about $8 for the 2 of us. And I also like the little piece of waffle cone that comes with it. Its better than a huge waffle bowl that is tough to break.

JERSEY MIKE'S IS EXPENSIVE FOR A SANDWICH SHOP! Just letting you know that right off the bat if you have yet to go there. Not quite sure what makes their ingredients so much different from the rest that's on planet Earth to warrant their pricing. But I digress. Beyond that the sub I had was very good. I tried the large chicken Parmesan (which will throw you back alittle over $11. That's just for the sandwich. So yeah, the people that work there probably have to work 2 hours to afford a sandwich there.) and I was not disappointed one bit. The only problem I had when I first got there was how to order. I thought it was like Subway so I was expecting them to ask me what I wanted on it while they were making it. But they just made it and wrapped it up without asking me what else I wanted on it. So word to the wise. Make sure u know exactly what you want on it the moment you order.

What's up to all you Yelpers out there? I recently came across this place yesterday as me, my girlfriend, and her daughter came out of the AMC theater at Westgate. This place must have just opened up this week as it was still closed last week when I was at Westgate. Now I want you to keep in mind that this place just opened when u go in. There isn't really anything about the look of the place that makes it stand out from any other place. The people genuinely seemed excited for us when we came in the place so that's good. Our waiter I didn't catch his name but he didn't seem to comfortable, he seemed kind of nervous. I had the Stromboli which I thought was pretty good. My girl had the greek salad, it was ok. The chicken that came on it seemed a bit dry. Her daughter had chicken tenders with french fries. She kept yelling saying how delicious it was so if u got a 4yr old go with the chicken tenders. I had a word with the person who brought our food because a couple of the chicken tenders look like as if they were bitten. They manager came out and offered to replace the meal but we didn't because she wasn't going to eat all of her meal anyways so what's one less chicken tender. We also ordered some garlic knots but we never got them. But I probably would have had I remembered then myself instead of hours later once I got home. But I guess that sums up r meal there at Mama Gina's. It was ok, but nothing really that makes it a "must eat" place. But I would recommend it if u happen to be at Westgate despite how my review comes across. Its just not a place that I would go out of my way to eat at. But I will give them the benefit of the doubt since they just opened this week and might need a bit of time to get situated and hit their stride. So I will probably wait and check it out again in a few months. The building its in has already been about 3 other places since Westgate open. So hopefully this place can stick around for awhile.

I'm giving Yoppi a 4 star review cause who wouldn't like to say the word Yoppi? It is pretty catchy. I love frozen yogurt and live only a couple blocks from this place. So finally i decided to go check it out. They have pretty good flavors and the yogurt is good. But sometimes it can be a bit watery. I like how they do the toppings that are in the containers on the wall that u turn the knob to get the toppings. I haven't seen that in any other yogurt shop. And they have a board on the wall where you get to vote for next weeks flavor. I also think that's a really good idea. The place looks plain to me though that I don't understand what took them so long to open. It seems like they could've put the place together in a day. I've seen them do more remolding/building in one day on a reality home makeover show. And they need to get more upbeat people working in there. The few times I've gone in there the staff has been a buzzkill. They barely said hi and when I asked them what certain things are. their reply was so dull I thought maybe they needed a hug or something. What I found funny about the place is that they ask for tips on the receipt. Its cool if you want to have a tip jar by the register. But to actually have it on the receipt at a SELF SERVE yogurt shop. Kind of defeats the purpose of it being self serving. I don't go tip the gas station after I pump my own gas at a self serve pump. And for a place asking for tips I expect a bit more of a upbeat attitude from the staff. But dont get me wrong the place is worth checking out. And the yogurt is really good and that's what matters. Im sure ill be in there often to try the new weekly flavors. After writing this review im glad the place is self serving. Cause if anybody who works there happens to read this and doesn't like what I said. I don't have to worry  about spit in my yogurt :P

I have to say i was walking kind of funny after attending this festival.  Not from eating so much food that my stomach was about to burst.  But from the feeling of getting royally shafted in the you know what from this thing.  Before i even walked in the door i spent $44 dollars for food and tokens.  And those tokens were only good for 3 grilled cheese sandwiches, 2 bottles of water, and 1 side of tater tots.  I had to run and go get more tokens right after that. Just to find out i could have used my debit card at the truck itself.  We were there for over 3 hours and we only got 4 trucks.  The lines were beyond ridiculous.  You was waiting at least 45 minutes minimum at most trucks.  Even to get ice cream at the Kool Twists truck was another 20 minute wait after you ordered and paid for your ice cream.  The worse one of them all was the Maine Lobster Lady.  She had the longest line by no fault of her own cause she was actually a very sweet lady.  But the price she was charging for her Lobster rolls were very overpriced for the size.  That roll alone took 10 tokens which comes up to $20.  For this being the 3rd annual  you would think they would have a better handle on everything. The best organized thing there was the parking. It was cool to go there to try something different. But unless they do a good overhaul and organize it better than i think i'll pass on going again from here on out. I ended up spending $88 in all in those few hours i was there.  I could've went to a nice restaurant for that price and got a much better meal.  And why do i get a offer for some free Yelp schwag if i find the tent only to see that there was no Yelp tent at the event to be found.

Being a black man I have an affinity for the derriere.  So when I heard of a place called Booty's.  I couldn't pass up the chance to go and check the place out.  So how was it?  It was kind of like the name of the place.  It was kind of booty.    My rating could change cause I didn't eat there, I ordered my meal to go.  It pretty much looked a bit more than a dive bar.  Which is nothing wrong with dive bars cause I enjoy going to those.  Some of the best people I've ever met or interact with were in dive bars.  The place was standard looking, nothing stood out or was unique about the place.  You know how Hooters has the owl theme.  Tilted Kilt has the Scottish look.  And Twin Peaks has the lumberjacks for their waitresses.  Booty's has nothing like that.    I will admit the food that I had was good.  I got the Badonkadonk burger with fries and it was nice and meaty like a badonkadonk should be :) The fries were pretty good as well.  But nothing stood out about them.  But for being "bar food"  it was above average.    The main reason for my rating was the smell.  As soon as I walked in there to order my food.  The place had a very foul smell in there.  It smelled.... and I hate to say it...but it smelled like urine mixed with Pine Sol.  Maybe they just mopped with dirty mop water or something.  But I was the only one that seemed to be effected by the smell.  Cause other customers came In and didn't seemed to notice at all.  But it wasn't like the place was packed. There was about 7 people total in the place.    I am willing to give this place another chance.  It does look like if you go with a group of friends to kick back and watch a game it could be a cool place. And the waitresses were really nice and friendly.    But if I have to give Booty's a booty score with 1 being Miley Cyrus booty (seriously, Google how flat that thing is.) And a 5 being Serena Williams booty (seriously Google how round that thing is.) I'll give Booty's a 2 which is below average to average booty score.  Which is probably equal to a Julia Robert's booty.

This review has been a long time coming. Why did i take so long to right a review about this place?  I have no idea.  But better late than never.  When this Dutch Bros. first opened up. I use to live right across the street from it on the other side of the freeway.  I've since moved, but i still make it point to come to this Dutch Bros. at least once a week.  In fact this is the only Dutch Bros. i go to cause i'm afraid of having a bad experience at another. And having that tarnish my dream of Dutch Bros. being the TRUE happiest place on Earth (No disrespect to Disney). Simply put,  I love Dutch Bros.  The people there is what makes it so good. Don't get me wrong the drinks are great.  My favorite is a blended Chai with the works.  I've tried some of the other coffees there and they are good. But i always come back to my blended Chai.    But as i was saying before it's the people that make Dutch so great. As i said in my tip.  No matter how bad of a day you are having.  It's hard to not come from that place being in a better mood cause they are so personable.  Yeah, at times the conversations can be repetitive if they don't know you even if you go there alot.  I always seem to see fresh new faces whenever i go.  So at times i do get kind of tired of having the same conversations.  But that is just me being nitpicky.  I can think of alot worse things when it comes to customer service.  And they seem to genuinely care about what you have to say.  Plus, how can you hate a place that is always playing good music.  And shines a disco ball during the overnight hours.  It's like a constant party at that place.  And all the employees seem to like being around each other.  I keep waiting for them to bust out dancing around a water fountain like a episode of Friends.  If you never been to Dutch Bros., what are you waiting for?  Why are you reading this review?  No, wait!  Don't stop reading this review :)  But seriously go out and find the nearest Dutch Bros. and indulge in their tasty coffee bean goodness.

I'm honestly actually pulling for this place to last. The look of the place isn't very good. You can tell it was a old yogurt shop as it still has the areas where the dispensers would be. Its pretty plain inside for the most part and I can see a lot of people just walking past the place. But the drinks are really good. You can tell that they are just getting off the ground as a business. Hopefully they stick around.

Suffering from a late night craving for something sweet, S'mores in particular. I found a article that said this was one of the top 5 places for S'mores in Phoenix. I haven't tried the other 4 places. But so far this one gets my vote for the best. What makes it so good is you, you actually get to make the S'mores right at your table. The server brings you a plate with Hershey's chocolate, marshmallows, and graham cracker. And a little tiny flame burning stove to roast the marshmallows on! The only problem I see is if a couple a drunk people act all crazy once they order that dessert. I could easily see a drunk person throwing a burning marshmallow on another person.  We didn't get a chance to try any of the entrees there. We ate somewhere else earlier but we was craving something sweet and this did not disappoint. I will for sure go there again just for the dessert. The menu also looked like they had some good food as well.

IN THIS CASE IF YOU SNOOZE YOU DON'T LOSE!  I've been to the Snooze in San Diego a couple times and absolutely loved the place.  In that Yelp review I said I was happy that they didn't have one here in Phoenix.  Cause if they did then I would turn into a fat ass from being there so much. So when I saw they opened up a Snooze out here I had to go.  This Snooze doesn't look as good or as big as the one in San Diego. But I came here for the food and the food did not completely disappoint.  What drew me there to begin with was the pineapple upside down pancakes.  I had a pancake flight, which allows you to pick 3 different pancakes.    I got the pineapple upside down, the carrot, and sweet potato pancakes along with the Green Eggs and Hammich.  The sandwich was good, but it wasn't anything great on the same level of the pancakes.  My girlfriend had the Sandwich I am and it was pretty bland.  I ended up being a good boyfriend and switching sandwiches with her since she liked mine.  Her daughter got chocolate chip pancakes.    The reason i couldn't give this Snooze 5 stars is because of the service and the wait time.  We had to wait for about 45 minutes for a table on a Saturday morning. Now granted it was Saturday and even the Snooze in San Diego you had to wait a while for a table.  But the difference with that one was every seat was packed. And when they told you that your table was ready, your table was ready.  Here they text you to let you know that your table is ready. Then we had to wait another 5 minutes for our table to ready. The Snooze out here looked like it still had quite a bit of room to seat a good portion of people who were waiting to get tables. We sat on the patio cause it was quicker and they still had a whole other corner that could be used for seating.  For some reason they have a ping pong table taking up that whole area instead.  The other reason is the service.  Our waitress was nice but she was very neglectful, at least to our table anyway.  She brought the chocolate chip pancakes with no syrup.  she didn't come back around to ask us if we wanted anymore water, napkins, or anything else. I had to get up and grab some hot sauce from the service cart myself.  She was going around to all the other tables around us asking them if they needed anything, going over menu items with other patrons.  The 2 ladies who sat across from us had a dog with them and the dog got better service than us.  Speaking of dogs, i love dogs. If you want to bring dogs into the restaurant that's all fine and good. But to have the dog sitting at the table with you while you eat (and not a little dog either) that's a bit much.   Like i said she wasn't mean by any means, but she was not a good waitress. Will i be back at Snooze? DUH! Does a frog bump its ass when he hops?  Of course i will be there again.  The pineapple upside down pancakes are what brought me there and the pancakes are what will keep me coming back.

I heard alot about this place, but wasn't quite sure where it was at. Turns out its right down the street from my best friends moms house who I visit often. I pulled up on a late Tuesday night. And I don't know how so many people can fit in the place. Other Yelpers  weren't kidding when they said this place is small. But it also says that you don't have to have an expensive looking place to cool. I loved The Whining Pig as soon as I stepped foot in the place. The owner was real cool and gave me a little bit of his back story with the place. It was pretty damn inspiring and had me thinking how cool it is to see someone take a chance on a dream to be happy instead of playing it safe in job that provides security but your miserable. There was a couple next to me playing Uno. Which was a nice change of pace to see a couple in bar playing a simple card game over being on their phones. The beer and wine that I tried were both good. And with such a huge selection to choose from. I have to go back again and again. And I got a free hot dog!!!  Go check out the Whining Pig if you haven't already. A true american story lol :)

Just because a business is in a nice area.  Doesn't mean it's the automatic bees knees!  I hate giving low star reviews, I really do.  But boy oh boy, the trouble we went through to get to this place just wasn't worth it.    I've never been to the Scottsdale quarter, parking was horrible.  Do I really need to valet park to go shopping?  Really?  Anyways after driving around the thing 2 times we finally decided to park in a loading zone.  It said 5 minutes, well 5 minutes was all we needed.  I was going to get a smoothie so I figured the energy boost from my smoothie will give me the endurance and stamina I need to chase the car down the street if I don't make it back in time and it gets towed so I wasn't worried.   The place was nice and small.  It had a nice look to it that made it seem like we was really in for a treat.  I know it's not October but we got tricked instead of the treat.  I will admit I am being kind of harsh on the place.  The girl who helped us was very nice and informative of the drinks.  But like other Yelpers have said, they were out of a few things.  My girlfriend got the Weekend Warrior I believed. Which consisted of almond milk, vanilla, honey, and few other things.  Hers had a nice taste and even better aftertaste.  I should've got one of those.  Instead I got the Immunie.  And the only thing the Immunie was immune to was providing good taste.  It seriously tasted like very bad watered down orange juice.  I would've been more happy if they gave me a packet of Tang and said have it.  The drink was such a rip off at over $8.  Seriously, every time I took a drink I would just look at the drink with a stank eye and just wanted to punch the cup. Cause I felt like a idiot for continuing to drink this mugging in a cup. Every time I took a sip I said "eight dollars!" I've never wanted to punch a cup before in my life until that day.  Even after saying all that, I would try the place again. If I happen to be in the area.  I went out of my way to find the place.  I won't make that mistake again, cause it was not worth it.  I usually like to give a place a couple chances and try something else on the menu before I review it.  But that drink just mad me angry at how bad it was for the price that they charged. I think when I got done with that watered down orange juice and was about to throw the cup away it spoke to me. It said "knock knock... Who's there? Orange...Orange who? Orange you glad I took your money?  No...I'm not."  That last part my have been a dramatization.

Modern Grove has the look of a Bud Light commercial. You know the one. Its outside in a cool looking backyard. Everyone is looking good even the dog that one person brought is cool. Then you have the 2 guys who bring more Bud Light at the exact time the music stops cause someone drank the last one and everyone thinks the party is over. Or the one where you walk inside the place and everyone knows who you are and you see the most gorgeous girl in the place and she sees you. So you nod to the bartender and he gives you the Bud Light to give to her. But instead you just look at her and slide it down the bar 50ft. And everyone just happens to move their drinks and purses out of the way at the exact time the beer travels down the bar. Not knowing a beer is traveling down the bar. And when the beer gets to her all that she sees is a phone number attach to the bottle cause you know she's going to call. And she does later on that night. Yeah. Modern Grove has THE LOOK of that! Exciting right? But man after eating at this place I was left with only one word and feeling...meh.  If you couldn't tell by my little story. The place looks great. It has the feeling like it should be the place to be anytime of day. It just doesn't have anything that makes it pop. Our server was nice. Everyone was nice. They were just meh.  We got the Mac N Cheese balls. Of course they sold it like it was so good. I bit into one and it was meh.  No flavor at all.  I got a shroom burger and sweet potato fries.  Again the burger and fries were meh. Just as bland as bland could be. If I could give a color rating instead of a star rating it would be beige. Cause when I first went in there I was full of energy wanting to do all kinds of things today. When I left I was like "what do you want to do?" "Nuttin." It just brought me down to not want to do anything the rest of the day. The bathroom had some weird chair in the corner like you're suppose to sit there and give advice to anyone who comes in to use the toilet. Or cheer them on if they have a hard time doing a #2. The drinking glasses that were given to us were dirty. So they gave us another set and those were dirty too and had lipstick on one of the glasses. If I ever go here again it would probably be for the bar at night. The place looks great, but the inside is dull and doesn't have much quality to offer. Its like the Kim Kardashian of restaurants.

Donuts... They are as much as a american past time as baseball, fast cars, apple pie, apple products, and Jordans (seriously, who isn't wearing Jordan something nowadays).    Back to the review at hand.  I came across this new donut shop on the holiest of days, Easter Sunday.  Holy Easter Sunday. Holes in donuts...My how the lord works in mysterious ways!  It was closed when i saw it that night.  So i thought i would check it out this morning.  Now i was a bit skeptical on how good the donuts would be cause on the outside of the building it has "Grand Opening 4/14/14" spray painted in blue on the glass. Would it have killed them to buy some poster board and some markers and make a sign?  But that didn't stop myself, Gandalf, Frodo, Bilbo, Gollum, and the rest of the Fellowship from venturing on into Daily Donut to try their sugary rings of goodness.  The place is very clean on the inside and pretty spacious. They have a pretty good selection of donuts and the place smelled fantastic.  I was in there around a little after 8am and there was a bunch of donuts. I only saw 2 people there working.  So if they made all of those donuts that morning, then hats off to them.  The lady at the counter was very nice and attentive to every customer who came in there.  It gave off the vibe to me that this donut shop they opened up was something they have been working towards and now that it's a reality, she appreciates the people who coming in there looking for some fresh donuts to start their day off.  The grand opening special that is going on until April 28th where you can get a dozen donuts for $5.99 was another selling point :)  The donuts themselves were very good and moist. I got a few glazed, a couple of cinnamon crunch, classic sprinkles, and chocolate topped with white frosting and nuts.  They are light and fluffy and not as sweet as say a Krispy Kreme.  Which is good. We all know donuts aren't the greatest thing for us to eat if were trying to be health conscious and watch our figures.  But its easier to not feel as guilty when the sweetness doesn't overpower the donut and make you feel like your eating a ring of pure sugar.    Speaking of health.  Donuts is not the only thing they sell there.  They also sell smoothies and Boba as well.  I didn't fully check out the menu so i'm not sure what flavors of smoothies they have.  Or what else they may offer.  It was the donuts that drag me in there and will get me to come in there again.  Is it a place that you would drive cross town to go get donuts from? No.  But if you happen to be close by or in the area.  Then go out of your way a bit and check this place out.  You won't be disappointed.

I know when a new place opens up it's easy to get all caught up in the hype and newness of it.  Looking at all these other 5 star reviews leaves me to believe that it's the hype more than anything that is blowing people away.    I went here yesterday morning and found out that yesterday was their actual grand opening and that the week prior was their soft opening.  That left me wondering if all of these 5 star ratings were just to get the word out about this place. Our server Dan was a really nice guy. He kind of looks like a bootleg version of Ryan Gosling in The Notebook when he had the beard. Yeah, I've seen The Notebook. What guy with a girlfriend hasn't? Anyways bootleg Gosling really took the time to get to know us.  The cucumber infused water was pretty good. And they do have some of the best orange juice I have probably ever tasted.  The chocolate covered bacon i had was pretty good. But maybe had too much chocolate on it. I was hoping for a salty sweet taste with the chocolate covered bacon and I mostly tasted chocolate and not much bacon til the last bite.   I will agree with some of the other reviews that their attire was all over the place. But that's not really a big deal. It seems like places that only cater to breakfast and brunch the staff wears pretty much whatever they like.   The main issue I had with the place was what I ordered. I drove all the way out there for Red Velvet French Toast. And what I got was Red Velvet cake with some kind of brulee it looked like put on top. It was ok. But considering the distance I drove. I was very disappointed that it was just cake. My girlfriend ordered the stuff french toast binoche. And instead got the Nutella banana french toast and hashbrowns. But she didn't notice until half way eating it cause it was so massive she didn't know that it wasn't stuffed. She really enjoyed the food that she ordered The portions they give you are very good portions.  Eggstasy has the look of being a hipster place for sure. The decor is cool even though the bathrooms don't have his/her signs on the doors. They still got some kinks to work out. But all in all it wasn't bad and I would recommend them and give them another try. Next time I'll try their sister restaurant attach to them called Sausage N Crack! Ok....I might have made up that one.

It's Jimmy John's! If you been to one you've been to them all.  Doesn't mean it isn't still good. Brand new location, but the sandwiches still taste good. And that bread! Oh that damn bread!   This location seems a bit smaller than some of the other ones. There doesn't seem to be as much seating. And some of the seating they do have seems to be real close together. But that's nitpicking. I come for the sandwiches and they're good like always. If it ain't broke don't fix it.

I know what The Marvel Experience feels like whenever I've gone and seen a Marvel movie. Fun, excitement, laughter. All joyous emotions. I felt none of that during this experience. This was just flat out horrible on many levels.   I avoided the dreaded $10 parking fee that others encountered. When I went with a buddy of mine Sunday night it was pretty dead. Guess the bad word of mouth had made it thru by then.   The staff was just so blah. No excitement or enthusiasm of any kind. But I will say that it was at night so maybe they are just tired from repeating the same stuff over and over.  The "interactive" stuff isn't much. It felt very cheap and that they were thinking. Let's just slap the name Marvel on it and people will love it. The Spider-man wall climb was just a regular rock climbing wall that moved. Would it have killed them to make a rock climbing wall that looked like the side of a high rise building? Or something like a magnet or velcro suit that let's u stick to walls? Dome 1 mostly consisted of monitors that had the origins of the characters which were all covered many times before in Marvel movies and cartoons. And the noise level of the dome drowned out the sound of the televisions, so you couldn't hear anything anyways. The "museum" was a joke. I was thinking it was a hall of Marvel history with props from some of the actual movies. All the props looked like plastic toys you could get a any toy store. Most of the games didn't work right. The holo simulator was ok, but it felt cheap. As far as computer animation has come along the graphics for the heroes in dome 1 was very lackluster.   The Quinjet that was advertised so much as a life size one that you wouldn't believe it was all one piece. Was just pretty much a wing. There was no cockpit or seats or anything like that. Just more monitors telling you about the origins of the villains.  They took away our initial bracelets when we reached Dome 2 and I for one have no idea why they gave them to us to begin with. Cause they told us when we first walked in that those bracelets they gave us didn't work. It just made no sense at all. The 3d movie was cool but it ends right when it starts getting good with no conclusion and the staff ushers you right into the next room. The 4d ride was fun for what it was. But again without those bracelets working the part where they want you to interact falls flat.   The gift shop was full of overpriced items and not many things to choose from.  It consisted of a certain amount of items just spaced out in different parts of the gift shop.   All in all for $37 its a major ripoff. I would feel like a straight idiot if I paid for the VIP package. The games are the same type of games you would find in a Peter Piper. You would think they would have people dressed up in character costumes walking around the place for photo ops. And it basically focus on The Avengers. If its a true Marvel experience where were all the hundreds of characters that they have in their library?   If your a 5 year old kid. This place is a blast. I got excited when I first pulled up to the place and I saw those huge domes all glowing and the music blaring. But if your a true Marvel fan thinking your going to go into the mecca of the world of Marvel universe. You'll come out very very VERY disappointed.

If you don't turn back into a child going into this place. Then something is wrong with you.  I heard about Cobra Arcade about 2 months ago.  So when I finally got around to checking it out.  I knew I would enjoy it, but I didn't realize how much it took me back.  The collection of video games in this place is impressive.  TMNT: Turtles in Time, Final Fight (Best beat em up of all time), The Simpsons, X-men.  They even got some of the small games that you might have forgot about, Sunset Riders, They even got Popeye and Track N Field for crying out loud!  Of course they got the classics like Super Mario Bros, Donkey Kong, and Pac-man.   You really can't go wrong with finding something that you'll like. I happen to go on Free Play night.  So I was just all about the games.  And it was nice finally after all these years beating games that I never got to beat as a kid cause I didn't have the money to keep playing when I would lose. The quality of the video game cabinets themselves are also very nicely kept.  Whoever got all these retro arcades did a great job of keeping them in pretty good condition or restoring them. I'm nitpicking though with TMNT just has a picture of a pizza on the front of it instead of the cheesy title art and picture that usually is on the front of the arcade machines.    I know they have places like GameWorks (R.I.P.) and Dave & Busters to get your adult gaming fix.  But those places seem exactly what they are, corporate, franchised establishments.  Cobra Arcade on the other hand has that old school neighborhood arcade vibe to it in spades.  It's dimly lit to where the arcade machines themselves light up the place just as much as the light fixtures.  There is graffiti on the walls.  I even like the nice touch on the bathroom doors.  If you notice the door to the men's bathroom has all male video game characters.  And the girls bathroom have all female characters.  The crowd ranged from hipsters, to cowboys, and everything in between. What struck me as funny was the crowd that was there was young. Most of them probably wasn't even alive or were just newborns when most of these games first came out.  The music was good.  If you ever watched Toonami or Adult Swim on the Cartoon Network and hear the music they play during those blocks of programming.  That is the type of music that poured out the speakers at Cobra Arcade.  They even have anime playing on the televisions in the background.    Those are all the pros...  The cons are the drinks.  They have the usual beers and all that, but their specialty drinks leave a lot to be desired. ALOT!  I got a 1 UP.  I'm sorry I can't remember what goes in it, but it sounded really good.  I paid $8 for a cucumber in some water pretty much.  The drink was so watered down it was unreal they were charging that much for it.  I want my drinks like my Netlfix, pay a little to get a lot.  I would have no problem dropping $8 if the price was worth it. Outside of that I don't really have any other problems with the place.  They don't serve food, but I don't think the place really needs it. It's about drinks and games.  Maybe down the road if they want to introduce some little things here and there then that would be cool.  But it doesn't make or break the great time you'll have at this place. Hopefully they'll have some video game tournaments there in the future. Go check Corba Arcade. You won't be disssssappointed. I know, bad pun.

For my first review of 2016, I'm going to shake things up.  See what I did there?  Now that I got the bad pun out of the way onto the review.  I guess I'm out the loop cause I've never heard of the Shake Shack.  I just happen to drive past it the day of its opening and then heard about it later on that night. So I went there the next day to see what all the fuss was about.  There was a pretty good size line going outside.  But they were very efficient at handling the line.  I got my order and food in less than 30 minutes.  Cons:  The fries I didn't think were that good.  They were just too hard like they were overcooked and I didn't like the taste of the cheese sauce.  It definitely is a acquired taste.  Pros:  The Black and White shack was fantastic!  I felt that It compliment the burger quite nicely.  As for the burger itself...Amazing!  If I could describe the burger it was as if In & Out burger, Five Guys, and SmashBurger had one big threesome and had a baby.  The burger is the size of a In & Out, The meat has the look of a Smashburger.  And the patty has the moistness of FIve Guys...only better.  But the taste from this piece of beef is all Shack.  I can't recall having a burger that was as juicy as this burger.  Each bite was juicier than the last. I didn't try the custard or the chicken sandwich.  I heard those were really good as well, so I will be back to try those next time.  They also serve beer there as well.  The girl working the counter told me as I was waiting for my food if I ever had Shake Shack?  I told her that I haven't.  She told me that I will not be disappointed.  She was absolutely right. Welcome to AZ Shake Shack.
