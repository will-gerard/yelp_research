Especially enjoyed the wheat beer. It was a fairly decent food truck menu. Beware of the alcohol limitations though. We were in on business meetings and were required to drink less than "brewery policy" due to house rules... Somewhat disconcerting. I hope they change that soon. Being from Phoenix, I'll give it at 3, but being ABQ that could be concerned to a 3.5.

Just moved into the neighborhood and we tried out Taco Tuesday. The building is fun and has a good vibe. Wait staff were friendly and the tacos were creative. I prefer the salsas a Joy Ride, but the tacos were great here and the prices were more than fair.

This is a great location/building, and I want so much to like the food and the service, but things just don't seem to be getting any better. They are new, so we wanted to give them a chance to work out some of the kinks, but the food is just bland and effortless. The menu is also annoying. I'm fine with a detailed description of what will be in my dish, but I don't want to have to read out all of the ingredients to place my order. Name your dishes people! Last time we went, I ordered the "scrambled farm eggs, blue corn tortillas, radishes, queso fresco, avocado, pico de gallo, chile sauce..." and it was a pile of flavorless mush. The Bloody Mary's have also been pretty disgusting both times I've tried. Again, really wanted to like it, but it would take a lot for me to give it another try at this point.

We've already been twice! Granted, we live just op the street. Everything we've tied has been delicious. My husband and I shared the salted cod tots and the crab dip featuring noble bread. Delicious. He had the cubano sandwich and I tried the carpaccio. Both were great. The cocktails are good too. We went just for drinks on Saturday and had a few of the bees knees and their version of a Moscow mule. Very refreshing, and I'm sure we'll be visiting again and again!
