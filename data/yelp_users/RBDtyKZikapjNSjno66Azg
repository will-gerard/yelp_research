Another one of my favorite places to eat.  Very large dining rooms and tables to accommodate large parties. I live right up the street and frequent here.  I order the 12 a lot and if I remember right the 41 (beef dish)  is really good as well.   Love the shrimp spring rolls and the Thai tea.  Lots of great food,  great service,  great place to eat.

I absolutely love coming here.  They have a wonderful atmosphere as well as wonderful food.  I enjoy almost every cut of meat they have.  The bar has a very nice feel to it and quite the selection of whiskey.  I don't know what else there is to say. Flip over your card and enjoy the Meat, Meat, and More MEAT!!!!!

35 cents to use my debit card?  This is the 21st century right?  And beer selection sucks...

Have eaten here many times and it is always super yummie.  I love the Thai tea,  everything  I have had here is quite good but the spicy basil beef is so far my favorite dish.   If you want some spicy ass Thai food ask him to make it extra Thai hot.   I love spicy food and it was almost to much for me.  Not many places stand up to the hotness scale they offer but here is a different story.    Always great service and the atmosphere is nice as well.  Filtered water which to me is a must have for any restaurant.    Come eat here now,  do it now,  not later.

I am going to have to agree with Jordi, this experience was very sub-par.  The place was dead and our service sucked.  My whiskey drink was the best part of the entire experience.  I ordered the Caesar Salad with chicken.  It was pretty bland for a Caesar but the croutons were good I guess.   I tried some of the pizza and while liking the Dough (I Love Bread) the pizza toppings and sauce were not that great.  I might come back and give this place a try again just because there are always those days.  But there are so many awesome places to eat in this area why bother.  I like trying new places better than places I did not like twice.

Stopped in for some beer to finish off the coffee.   Great food too come here for the burgers.   Live music,  poker tournaments,  pool tournaments,  nice waitresses,  good beer on tap.   Like coming here, close to the house and taco Tuesday rocks.

I work right across the street from this place and it is one of the only places that I have not gotten sick of in the 3 years I have worked were I do.  Mind you they opened a little after I started work but the point is I could always eat at this place and enjoy the food.    I either order the blacken chicken burrito or the blacken chicken tacos.  They are always amazing, I would recommend these to people all the time.  Everyone I have gotten them for loves them.  The chorizo breakfast burritos are also really good.    They use fresh ingredients and make amazing food.  The owner is there all the time and a great guy as well.  If you have never eaten here I highly recommend it.

I cannot say enough good things about this place.   Even if you are not fond of a certain type of food, Chances are you will like it here.   I hate beats and thought the beats with sauce was quite delicious.   Normally not big on vinegar and enjoyed the vinegar dressing.     The meatballs (both kinds)  were almost as good as I make at home (which you just can't beat). I just kind of mixed everything together with some of the dumplings and my girl friends jager chicken.  Would order it all again!   Enjoyed it all so much we ordered the poutine?  (fries,  cheese curds and gravy)  to go.  I am assuming I am going to like this too.    You should eat here,  it's friggen awesome.

I absolutely love this place we order delivery all the time.   The service is always fast and the food is always great.   The Thai-tea is really good too.  I am glad they moved in so close to me.  Going to have to visit the restaurant sometime.

Okay first off I just want to say that I have been to quite a few vape shops in this town  and this is hands down the best shop I have been in. They have a huge selection of juice and tons of vaping products to choose from, including hard to find full mechanical mods and RBA's.  I don't know what that renato guy is talking about because Chris has been more than helpful with every single question I have had and is even working on contacting a seller directly to try and replace a broken part on one of my mods.  The staff there know everything there is to know from getting started with a basic ecig to setting up full blown mech mods.  If you want to learn how to build a dual coil RBA for the new mod you buy, they will not only sell you an awesome product but they will sit you down with you and teach you how to set it up.  If you are just trying to quit smoking they will sit you down and let you try any one of the 50+ or so flavors that they have in stock and set you up with everything you need to never smoke a nasty *** cigarette ever again.  I will never shop anywhere else in this town after visiting Vapor Vortex.  If you want to quit smoking, if  you are looking to buy a new mod, or just want learn more about mechanical mods and how they work,  you should do your self a favor and go see the guys at Vapor Vortex.     Vapor Friendly they are, Quit smoking you must.

This place is amazing.  The beer soaker uppers (pretzels) are the best I have ever had and the cheese keeps up with the quality as well.  I love the feel of this place and had really good service too. See Randal at the upstairs bar, did not even have to ask for a box for my food as he had already brought me one when I went to ask.      I had the chili dog to eat and holy chit is this thing off the chart.  Somewhere underneath a gargantuan pile of chili and cheesy awesomeness is a frigging delicious dog.  Finished off with a pretzel bun and this is hands down one of the best I have had.   I plan on coming here too try many more things off this menu.    Also Be sure to check out the rooftop bar, the selection of draft beers is limited but the view and feel make up for it.    Glad to live so close to this place will be back!  Don't listen to previous negative reviews it's hard starting off a new restaurant but this place has settled in nicely and is top notch for sure.

Looks like I found me a new pizza spot.   Not only are the prices right but the pizza is amazing as well.   Very fast and super friendly service (for delivery).   Would highly recommend the garlic knots too they are delicious.   Do your self a favor and give this place a try you won't be disappointed.

This place is a joke they think their burgers are made of gold...  I wanted to like this place but the truth is no matter how good your burger is paying 17 dollars for a half pound burger fries and a small drink is ridiculous.   It is just like the overpriced indulge burger that used to be in this location that closed down.  I will not be coming back here as I don't like paying ridiculous prices for things that are not that great to begin with.  The bun is super small,  the burger is greasy,  non seasoned and tasteless for only 10 bucks.  I guess the fries are okay for only 4 bucks more.  Then you pay 3 bucks for a cup that holds about 5 cents of soda.   I don't see this place being here long.
