What a place. The food is incredible. I had the Jouliet rouge and seafood gumbo. The gumbo as great flavor, and full of crab, shrimp, crawfish. The Jouliet Rouge; Blackened catfish, on top of dirty rice, covered in shrimp and crawfish sauce.  Wow, this makes me yearn for my Louisiana trip to come sooner, however I will be back. On top of everything the prices are great, as well.

I want to like this place, its close to home, and the girls are cute, but this is 2/4 times ive left this place, gone out, and people have asked if I cut my hair myself. Today people actually took pictures of it and showed me, holy hell. If they paid me for this haircut, id still want a refund. I'm leaving town for a week and won't be able to go back, nor would I trust them again. Too hotties is terrible.....
