The pineapple teriyaki wings are great, the honey hot flavor is awesome, but the bar is not always clean as it could be. I hate traveling to the one in Ahwatukee because I'm ALWAYS the only minority there and I tend to get a bit scared all by minority lonesome. I've visited this location a few times and it's never as clean as the one in Ahwatukee. Serious SAD FACE!

I came here for lunch and ordered the wagu burger. Yum, yum, and more yum! Food was great, service was great, and the lunch menu is very affordable.

Great salad buffet! The blueberry muffins are always good and hot! Too expensive for just salad though. Awesome service! Warm cookies are a nice touch.

Shrimp Taco is awesomeness. I hate that the seating is not ideal, but the food is so worth it. My first time having authentic Mexican food.

Food is always great! Tootsy Maki is always awesome. The music is always great. But the service... The service could be so much better. I came here with my daugther, sister, and some co-workers. I had surgery that restricted me to a certain type of drink. The waiter said I had to throw my drink away do to health code. I was fine with that so I put my bottle in my purse. I asked for water so I could add my protein powder in the water provided.  I was mid way finished with my drink and instead of her asking could she refill she reached across the table and refilled my protein powdered water with lemon water. WTF? Also the booth we were in smelled funky, like dish water... eeek! I will still come for the Tootsy Makie and Tempura Shrimp but I will make sure I always sit outside.

Best Kohl's ever! The first day I came to Arizona my mom needed some jeans to wear because it was a bit chiller than we thought it would be. We found a great deal. The employees are nice and the store is always clean. Great awesome deals.

Del Taco is way better than Taco Bell and the prices are way cheaper! The fried shrimp taco is unhealthy fried food heaven. The service is always fast and the employees are funny! Did I mention the prices are way cheap?

Salmon Cesar Salad = the bomb dot com! The salmon is always cooked perfectly. Lettuce is always fresh and they always modify the dish for me! Love the atmosphere and the places is always clean. Good wait staff! I hate the service at the Ahwatukee location (Ray Rd.), so I travel all the way to Mesa to enjoy the Charleston's experience.

Love, love, love BBW! I was going to purchase the car freshers and I went into grab 4 (buy 4 get 2 free) and the associate came looking over breathing down my clavicle , scapula and humerus area! Like WTF did you think I was stealing? I was going to just put the items back and go to another BBW but I decided to just make my purchase and get out of that store.

The wine was great, the cheesecake was awesome, the crab cakes were delish! My daughter had the mini corn dogs a great deal and she loved them! Very impressed with the cleanliness of a restaurant located in a busy mall.

Service is always horrible. A female server was training a new guy and she was very rude. Still tipped her good regardless of her rudeness. Food is always well prepared and tasty but the service could be much better.

The MAC counter is the worse!!!! Horrible stuck up over made up stuck up associates. I've been to MAC twice and not one time out of the 10 people they have working the counter do I ever get asked for help! My intentions were to go to lush but we couldn't find it and didn't have much time to find it! I had the worse experience at MAC yesterday. I wish I wore Lancôme because that lady was attentive and nice! I will never spend my money at this MAC counter again!

Every time I go to YC''s I always have a great experience. Service is great, food is good, place is always clean! The price is the best because it's not expensive but the food is awesome. Making your own sauces is a fun experience also.

Kristie C service today was horrible. Took too long to take drink order, took to long to take food order, food took forever to arrive and it wasn't even hot! Garlic bread was cold! Kid never got refill, another person in my party water was taken to refill but never brought back. Took forever to receive check. I'm a regular at this Applebee's but I will not be going back.

Just picked up my order and I'm so disappointed! This was once my favorite pizza place. When I walk in the girl who's was behind the counter is drawing on promotional material and doesn't acknowledge me as a consumer about to make a purchase. After a few minutes without looking up from her drawing project she ask, "Did you call in?"... I paid and left, wish I would have checked my pizza before I left. The pizza was practically burnt! I realty liked this place before such a horrendous experience!

I have visited Sephora about 10 times since my last review. My last visit which was yesterday, SUCKED!!!!! I went in and knew exactly what I wanted but they didn't have it on shelves yet. After five minutes of standing in the same place a consultant came to me and asked if I needed help. I told her what I was looking for and she informed me they just got the product in and she had to go get it from the back. She brought out multiple shades and the lady at cash register was helping her select a good match. The lady who called herself helping out picked the darkest shade possible handed it to me and told it would do... I informed the MUA concelar is suppose to be lighter not way darker.... Shame...

Since I was so in love with the NARS creamy concealer I went to purchase some more. When I walked in the store there were lots of associates just standing around talking. I had to walk up to a lady with a clip board and ask for help. I asked if she had the NARS creamy concealer and she took me to the Urban Decay display and said here. I told her I asked for NARS not Urban Decay, then she goes to the Nars side and looks around and says "Oh I just did training and this and we don't have it in." I thought, I just purchased this a few days ago. Horrible!!!!!!

Lucille's Smokehouse kids ribs are awesome! Good deal and good taste. Service could have been better but the food was awesome. I would have given 5 stars but the prices could be lower! Great food, sub par service.  I'm from the south and this is the closet southern BBQ I've had since I've live in Phoenix, AZ.

I love this place but the first time I went my experience was HORRIBLE! The kids pizza took 1 hour, the food was cold my order was wrong twice and the manager had the nerve to think I was going to pay for food I didn't get to eat. This experience was when they first opened. Glad I went back because I had twins for waiters and they were awesome! Totally changed my view of Spinatos. The chicken Marsala is great, bread sticks are the best and the atmosphere is hip and trendy.

Best breakfast in Scottsdale! Omg! I had a whole hog skillet with scrambled cheese eggs, my brother had the same with a sunny side egg. My sister had wild berry bliss toast. Also ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of cheese grits. Ordered so much to sample due to the amazing delicious looking images provided by Yelpers. We spent about 65 bucks including tip. Well worth it.

The Pizza is great and service is always speedy. The last waitress I had sucked balls. She was rude, but maybe she woke up on the wrong side of the bed.Try the Heck A Slice for lunch, good deal.

Food was okay but staff was unfriendly. Order a kids meal and was charged for a regular meal. When I mentioned that I order a kids meal the cashier looked at me and asked "Are you sure?" Horrible experience.

At first I thought these guys were cool, but when I checked my drawer full of contraceptives and it was almost empty after being full I was HEATED! How do you steal condoms and tongue vibrators from someone? I paid over $200 bucks to be burglarized? Horrible, slow, lazy, disrespectful movers! Glad I took pictures and have a webcam set up in my room... Taking this to a lawyer!

The variety is great, but I think they if they served the princess cupcake every day they would get so much more business! Cupcakes are top heavy which is fine because the icing taste way better than the cake itself. I found the cake portion of the cupcake to be mediocre but the icing is totally worth it! The best flavors are Miss Princess, Wedding Cake, & Birthday cake. I do feel the prices are too high.
