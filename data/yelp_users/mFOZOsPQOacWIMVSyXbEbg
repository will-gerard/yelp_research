Now this is an adult entertainment venue worth visiting.   In a town full of overpriced, over-hyped strip clubs with under-talented girls, the OG stands out as what a strip club should be. Dirty, bawdy, nasty fun.   The cover charge is the same as everywhere else: $30 for out-of-towners, but that's where the similarities end. OG is not trying to be "the most luxurious" anything, and the prices reflect it. They're not charging $20 for a shot of Patron if you get my drift. The drinks are still expensive, but where in a Vegas strip club can you get a cheap drink anyway?  The space is dark, decent (if not a little on the dirty side) and would pass as a higher-end club in any other city such as Portland. The girls know how to work the pole (at least a few were climbing up, swinging around, etc), which provided an actual reason to sit at the rack. Our server Ericka was 100% on, super nice, and took great care of us even though we weren't buying bottles or paying ridiculous VIP fees to sit at some VIP table. The girls weren't pushy for the most part, and they were all more than happy to give the bachelor much more than his $20 worth for each dance.   We didn't venture into the VIP room, but we hear it's pretty fun back in there. I'll just leave it at that.   While myself I prefer more laid back adult entertainment (I'm from Portland, so I don't care to pay a whopping premium for fake-ass luxury), this club was a happy medium between spots like Treasures and the Rhino and, well, joints that might be filthy enough to scare off your average bachelor party crowd.   I hear they also have a male revue upstairs, so there were a lot of non-stripper girls in the club as well.   Of the 3 clubs I went to while in Vegas for a bachelor party, the OG is where I had the most fun, and definitely would be my first choice upon my return visit.

In order to keep this civil, I'm going to just write a list, because left to open narrative, who knows what depths of hell will be plumbed by this review.   1. Brusque, rude gate agents in Portland, OR yelling at me like I'm a child (right out of the gate, not in response to anything I did, they were yelling at everyone)  1.5. Did I mention that the gate agent lady was rude? She was being incredibly mean to even smiling, elderly people. Sure lady, we all have bad days, but you work in customer service. Get your shit together or find some job where you don't have to interface with people.  Wow.   2. Making me pay $10 to choose a seat in advance so my massive 6' tall broad-shouldered frame doesn't get shoehorned into a middle seat by (see 1 and 1.5 above). Since when do you have to pay to select a seat when you're paying over $300 to fly same-coast?  3. $20 for the first checked bag, $25 for the second (unless you check in online, then you save $5 per bag). That's steep.  4. Same ticket price if not higher than other airlines except in this one strange situation where I booked just a week in advance and this happened to be the cheapest ticket.   Why would I ever pay more to experience all of the above? I have a return flight to take, and I'm crossing my fingers that it's better than the two I took today.

What's worse than spending 2.5 hours laid over in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport en route from SAN to PDX?   Arriving at gate A25, walking all the way to scheduled gate B10, hanging out in a bar nearby to wait out the 2.5 hour layover, Paying over $8 per beer, then discovering, right as the plane is supposed to be boarding, that the gate has been switched back to A23, and having to run the distance all the way back to A23, which happened to be 2 gates away from where I originally arrived (see hi-res image linked above).   Thanks for making me run some useless laps.

People say Vegas is all fake. They haven't been to Stage Door. This spot is a stone's throw from the Disney-fied, all-nonsense Strip, but offers a very local, no-nonsense drinking experience. It's dirty. It's dive-y. It's smoky. And it's drunk. With $2 wells and $3 Jaeger shots, it's no wonder that locals getting off from their soul-crushing jobs dealing with tourists all day come here to unwind. And those tourists in the know, who may be sick of paying $14 for a Jameson in the casino bar a half a block away can come here too.   Breathe in the foul stench of yesteryear - a heady mix of cigarette smoke, ETOH, old hotdogs and despair. If there's a smokeeter in here, it's overworked. The lady at the bar, Mama San, is all smiles. The locals getting shit-housed off the cheap booze are friendly. And you can easily while away a lot of time getting hammered without hammering your wallet.   Frankly I'd take this experience any day over most of what else is offered on the legendary street a half-block away. For where it is and what it is, Stage Door is a five-star dive, IMHO.

Mint Indian Bistro is an interesting spot. It's not like most Indian places I'm used to. A little more upscale, a little more gourmet, a little more... well... different. My paradigm for Indian food is, in general, that the best food comes from the dingiest places - so a proportionally inverse relationship between the fanciness of the decor and the quality of the food (from the standpoint of taste). When I walked in to Mint I immediately formed an impression about what I was going to eat, and I was not too surprised in the end. Just glad to have some decent Indian food since I come from a place that has none.   The food at Mint falls into the higher-end category - better meats, obviously more hand-made sauces, etc. Not as dirty, earthy, pungent, and 'street' as the style that really rocks my socks. But it's good nonetheless, and sticks fairly well to form as being actual Indian and not fusion, which is what I tend to see at higher-end Indian places.   I sampled the chicken Vindaloo, which at a half order contained a surprising amount of tender, succulent chicken but not the same amount of potatoes that I'm used to. It has a decent heat to it but not quite the "fiery descent" that's comically described on the menu. The Saag Paneer is quite nice, with a less 'spinach-y' flavor than I'm used to. A much more subtle and balanced version of the heady green beast. The name of our third curry escapes me - a blond affair with veggies. Nice and creamy and delicious - probably my favorite of the three. Paired up with a bowl of basmati rice and a basket of Roti, 3 half-sized (8oz) dishes makes for a beyond-filling meal for two. Props for offering half-size portions... if only the price were half too!  The drinks list is mighty impressive, with a very extensive beer selection, some fun cocktails including a whole spate of flavored lassi offerings, and of course wine. My rose vodka lassi was interesting (tasted like rose!) and the mango rum is exactly what you'd expect.   Three half-plates, Roti and two lassi cocktails came to a sum total of $54, kind of a lot for the amount of food, but definitely a higher quality of ingredients than I'm used to seeing in the street Indian I usually seek out. The experience, including the impeccable service, also adds in to the value. Papadam to start, clean plates to transition from papadam to meal, and constantly full waters. This is probably the largest departure from the dirty hole in the wall spots I hit in SF for my sub-continent fix.   I'd definitely come back after spending some more time exploring Indian options in LV.

As far as I'm concerned, the trendy, chic AZ88 has three things going for it:   1. There's a "Celebratory Champagne" cocktail that involves colored confetti sugar sprinkled in to the drink table-side (and, in fact, all of the cocktails are very good), 2. The cocktail prices here are beyond reasonable for the swanky vibe, and 3. The spot is open pretty damn late for being in an otherwise seemingly-dead part of town.   Located right behind the Saguaro, AZ88 was our go-to bar for late night shenanigans, as most of the other bars in the immediate area seemed to be closed. I was impressed by everything I consumed at this bar, and surprised at the resulting bill (having spent the prior days overpaying for drinks in hotel bars in Sedona and Scottsdale). $7 or $8 for a Buffalo Trace Manhattan is good by any standards.   Service here was on point during both visits, and did a solid job of splitting checks and keeping up with our ever-growing/changing crowd.   The food I sampled here was decent but nothing mind-blowing. However I'd come back in for drinks any time. And sing "WOOOOO" every time someone gets some confetti sugar sprinkled in their champagne cocktail.

Words that come to mind when I think of my stay at the Venetian:  Huge Grandiose Opulent Garish Sprawling Complex Confusing Bewildering Fascinating Intense Expensive Suites Perfume Walking (lots of)  I could connect all of those words together to form some form of verbose review (as I usually do), but I think you can figure it out from there.

This review is primarily for Mandalay Bay's casino. I stayed at THEHotel and have a separate review for that joint.   As far as Mandalay's casino goes, I have a hard time complaining. They offer up the usual compliment of card tables, slots, video crack (poker), craps, a huge sports book and all sorts of high-roller action. For me, it was all about penny slots and blackjack here. I discovered a unicorn-themed penny slot machine that magically granted me $30+ in winnings on my first night in the casino. I could almost smell the rainbows.   Second night I posted up at a $15 minimum blackjack table, and while I wish these casinos would have at least one $5 minimum table I know that $15 is the new strip standard. Regardless, after three hours and at least as many dealers I walked away 150% richer and with no less than 15 Kennedy-heads in my pocket. Did I say walk? I meant stumble. And the only reason I left is that they closed down the pit for cleaning.   Otherwise it's a pretty clean casino, nice and hidden down at the end of the strip, and there are plenty of places to fuel up for a night elsewhere on the strip.

If you're going to rock a name like THEHotel, you better step up. And in most cases, Mandalay does. Not quite to the level of 5-stars, but close.   THEHotel is the upscale wing of Mandalay... as long as you don't count The Four Seasons, which I imagine is in a whole league of its own. This would be like the W to Mandalay's Westin. A little more hip, swankier, and, well, interesting. The rooms are sleek and decent size - equipped with plush robes, electronic window shades, Bose clock radios, big screen (but not flat screen? Weird!) Tv's, and my room had a big bathroom with jacuzzi tub. The bath products are L'occitane and include bath sugar cubes for the tub. There's no in-room coffee or water and no minibar or fridge, so be prepared for that.   My room was on the 62nd floor. No, the hotel is not that tall, but for some reason it skips from 38 to 60  in one floor. Never figured out why. Regardless, my desert view room had a rad view out over the flat wasteland that is the SW off-strip. Freeway noise was negligible.   The staff here is efficient and unlike the front desks at the mega-resort side, there's no cattle-call action. I walked right up to check in and same to check out. Huge plus! Valet is right next tot he desk too so no long-hauls through casinos or anything to get to your destination. And the location off in the corner of the Mandalay complex means less cross-traffic from the hordes.   An off-night rack rate of $100 (plus all sorts of hidden resort fees) was good for the quality of room and level of hotel class. I'd definitely stay here again if I could get it for a good price. The only sad part was that I was there on business and didn't get to use the pool, which I hear is the best on the strip.

Nice enough service, but the food is mediocre processed crap served at atrociously exorbitant prices. It's like sports stadium expensive.   Other airports need to take a page from the PDX play book and restrict restaurants from charging more at the airport location thn they charge at their other locations. $12 is too much to pay for nachos unless there is Kobe beef or foie gras on them.   And they have the typical overpriced drinks with the standard "make it a double for only $3 more!" Sure. Why not? I totally want to pay over $25 for one drink and some crappy nachos. Bring it on.   At least my hard earned $$ is going to... crap. Is that Fox? Dang.

Sometimes I get the notion that the real things in Las Vegas stand out so vividly in my mind based solely on their radical departure from the mediocre, flashy, corporate food and drink that dominates the Strip. But you know what, A bar like DCR could stand its own anywhere. Because the drinks here are legit.   I am not a fan of pretense, but I am a fan of a well-made cocktail. And well-made cocktails abound here. Creative concoctions that range from classics to bar-specialties. Served up in well-balanced mixtures from proper glassware in a swank setting.   There's not a lot to say other than that if you want some truly great cocktails in a stepped up environment that's free from the ultra-flash of the fancy clubs, DCR is your place. Craft-cocktails for discerning palates. And a punchbowl option for groups!

The Griffin is a pleasant surprise and escape from your typical done-up Vegas bar. It has a nice, dark, hip feel to it that's matched by the hip (and hipster) clientele. When you walk in the door, the only noticeable reason you'd still think you're in Las Vegas at all is the heavy cloud of smoke in the air. Yes, this is a common refrain in reviews of this spot written by out-of-towners, but since smoking is banned everywhere else, it's extra noticeable to us.   Anyway, this is definitely the kind of place I could linger for a few drinks on any given night. The vibe is mostly laid back. The brick adds a great touch. The booze isn't dramatically overpriced, and the fireplace is cozy. Bartenders are plenty friendly, there are some excellent booths for kicking back, and the feng shui is solid.   I'm definitely adding this to the list of must-visit watering holes in Downtown.

Grabbing a salad to go from a brusque, hijab-bedecked counterperson at a tiny kiosk near gate 30 may sound appealing to gourmands, foodists and all around salad aficionados alike, but it's simply not all it's cracked up to be. Lesson learned.  The salad selection here is all meat, all the time. I guess people in Arizona can't even eat a salad without meat on it? Maybe I'm just being judgmental. Possibly I'm trying to get a rise out of my AZ-filiates with this inflammatory post. But honestly, the rest of the food in Sky Harbor Purgatory is pretty abysmal and mostly meat/cheese/bread-based, and even this last-hope outposts of salads doesn't offer anything truly healthy. The chicken is of suspicious quality and Allah himself only knows when it was actually cooked. Gristly bits are rife. The lettuce is dried out but not wilted (how does that happen?!) and the dressings are all cream-based.   Can't I just get some greens... maybe some fiber and roughage? Something fresh and/or healthy? At least one of those two? Pretty please with dates on top?  It cost me about $9 for a boxed, pre-pre-pre-made salad and it was an unsatisfying salad at that. The surly attitude of the counterperson may have been the best part of the whole experience.   +1 star for actually serving salads, a menu item conveniently forgotten by every other food vendor in the area.

As I sat in the back of my taxi, head reeling from last night's lack of sleep and numerous free casino drinks, pocket full of cash I won at Mandalay's blackjack tables, I thought to myself "the only thing that will make this day better is In-n-Out for breakfast. Fortunately I had just leaned out the back window to order two grilled cheese animal-style sandwiches and a large coke from the drive-thru at this burger mecca. The cab driver admitted that no, this was not the first, nor would it be the last, time that he had been hired to drive someone off the strip to score some 10:30am in-n-out. I was confident that this was the right decision.   Twenty minutes later, as I sat across from the check-in counters at McCarran making a mess out of myself with delicious fast-food saucy cheese sandwiches, I thanked myself for making such a glorious call.   In-n-Out truly is special. It's fast food that's WAY better than any other options out there. Fast, fresh, delicious, clean, cheap, and damn good.   And this one has a big flashy light-up sign.

Daily Dose does the trick. Enough so that I ate breakfast here two days in a row. And while I'm sure this bar and restaurant serves many different purposes to many different people, I think I can tell that breakfast would be my main reason for stopping in here.   What do I like about it? Well, the menu is diverse and easily customizable. Both days I wanted to get some protein heavy, low carb options and while they do have some pretty healthy stuff already on offer, I chose to go the omelet route and sub out some the taters and toast for other stuff, like cottage cheese, other proteins, etc. And I got zero hesitation or argument. Yay! Nice and easy. The food itself? Tasty. Nothing uber gourmet or mind-blowing, but I can tell they're using better than average ingredients, and said ingredients are put together well.   Service was quick and friendly on both visits. And weekday breakfasts, at least around 730 am, are pretty quiet. So it's get in, get eatin', and get on to work. BOOM!   Not really my style/vibe for other meals/occasions, I value this kind of food and service and quality for breakfast. Normally I have to work hard to get away from the starch-driven meals that dominate breakfast menus, but here they're ready for me and my quirky needs. Dig it!

This Walgreen's is incredibly convenient if you're staying on the strip in the Venetian, the Wynn, Treasure Island, or Mirage. It's located under the Canal Shops at the Palazzo and can serve any and all of your sundries needs.   This is definitely the place to stock up on your needs for your weekend in Vegas so you don't have to pay a premium to buy them from the hotel when you need them. Sunscreen, bottled water (stay hydrated! It's a desert out there!), Advil... you name it, they've got it.   Convenient and affordable. Good stuff.

Cocktail geeks rejoice - craft cocktails exist in Vegas. I'm not sure since when, but they're here in full effect at Herbs & Rye. The elixirs you'll find coming across this bar are seriously top notch and could stand their ground against any in my favorite coastal cities such as Portland, Seattle, SF and the like. I'm so glad  to have found this spot (thanks to all who recommended it and to Misti for taking me there) and it will definitely be on my itinerary for any return trip.  This is the lest "Vegas" bar in Vegas,  and that's one of the big reasons I am drawn to it. No flashy BS, no gaming, no smoking, no crazy-extreme high prices on the drinks, and almost zero pretense. Nice guys making stellar drinks in a chill, subdued setting (at least when I was in there) that's free of all the glam and glitz that exists a few blocks away. Nothing against that stuff (my stop prior to this was for a delicious cocktail at the fancy Vesper Bar) but I sure do love me good cocktails minus the snoot.   The cocktails on the list are all classics, organized by the decade that gave birth to them. The list is medium-length but very carefully curated, and I found no less than three of my favorite elixers jumping off the pages and into my glass. The two drinks I sampled were a Vieux Carre (a personal fave) and a Remember The Maine (also a fave). Both were impeccable - perfectly balanced with a nice depth of flavor. High quality ingredients and trained hands sure do make some fine drinks.   The story behind the guy who owns the place is a cool one too. He started out at the bottom and made is way up to the top - self taught. I respect that. And his humility and charm is something often not seen amongst the highest level of mixologists. He's a true barman.   The food menu is hearty and tasty. I only sampled the truffled mac side fior $7 (a hearty portion) and it fit the bill.   For a respite from overpriced drinks and chaos of the strip, get thee to Herbs & Rye. You'll make up your $$ on cab fare after only a couple of drinks and you'll be so glad you did.

As with everything, Arizona has to be different, so instead of the usual airport car rental setup, all agencies renting out of Sky Harbor are in this monstrous rental car facility that's akin to a giant parking garage, and like everything in Phoenix, it's spread way far away from the airport. Hop on a car rental bus and head over to this terminal of automobiles to claim your car.   Thrifty has always been fairly quick and efficient, and on the Friday I arrived, the office wasn't busy at all. I was able to get to my car and on the road right quick. But not without passing through some tough-but-friendly security on the way out of the facility. I guess it's that way because some of the rental companies just let you pick your own car from a bank of autos. I do find this cool - getting to choose my vehicle from a set of available cars. The Ford Fusion SEL with stereo device hookup was plenty of car for the $16/day rate I scored, and to top it off, the fill-in-advance offering was only about $.20/gal more than your average local station. Not feeling ripped at all.   Return process was pretty quick as well. It was much busier, for some reason, on the Thursday afternoon I was departing than the Friday evening I was arriving, but they got my car checked in right quick.   Overall, solid service. The car I rented could have been a little more clean, but at the rate, I was fine with it. And I guess I could have always checked in other available cars to see if there was a cleaner one.  Oh well. Lazy happens.

It's rare for me to place experience above food. When it comes to dining, the most important thing to me is what I put in my body. And the food here? It's a'ight. Solidly decent diner food. Omelets, pancakes (which are allegedly delicious), sandwiches, pies, eggs n' meat, etc. My Denver omelet was decent enough, with the size being the major plus. My turkey sausage links? Not so much.   But what really seems to fit the bill here is simply the authentic classic diner experience. This is an old school coffee shop/diner in the exact sense. You walk in and are greeted at a cash register, there are vinyl booths and a long counter with fixed swivel-stools (also covered in vinyl), and uniformed servers cutting pies, buttering toast and pouring drip coffee into classic white diner mugs. It's something I haven't seen in quite some time, and I like it.   I'm kind of on a weird diet right now so I didn't get a chance to try the much-lauded pancakes, but I saw quite a few come out and they looked great. So did the hashers (man I miss those). And everyone dining there (mostly at least 20+ years older than me) all looked like they were enjoying their ham-steak and eggs, pancakes, etc.   Pluses include classic diner service, atmosphere, and portions. Food quality hits about middle here. I've had a lot worse diner food. So if you're in the market for a solid greasy-spoon breakfast, lunch or dinner, this is your diner.

Yes! I may be getting over-excited about this sweet little coffee house based on the stark difference between it and everything I experience while staying on the strip, but even after a couple of days of consideration, I still am struck by how cool this join is.   First off, they have coffee, and it's pretty decent. They also serve real food. Not just pastries, but real food, which always garners favor with me. I appreciate being offered something other than just the usual token pastry case when I'm getting cracked out on coffee. However I didn't try the food here so I can't say how good it is. But it exists, and alongside the decent coffee, authentic atmosphere and fast wifi, it completes a package.   More on the atmosphere - this joint sits in the Emergency Arts building, which houses a bunch of cool little gallery spaces harboring fun, funky art. Most weren't open when I visited but I did peek through some windows and could see myself wanting to return to see what the local hip arts community is up to. There's also a large selection of vinyl in the space, and you can peruse (and even play?) records there while you're sippin' on joe. Very cool.   The staff? Friendly.   I'm super, duper glad I decamped from my situation at chain-coffee ground-zero and sought out some realness. For any visitors or locals looking to avoid the 'bux or the chaos just a few miles down Las Vegas Blvd, this is your spot. Grab coffee, post up, get things done, and feel good about the whole thing.

Glam, glitz, and good cocktails. Really good cocktails. That's what the Vesper Bar at The Cosmopolitan is all about. And smoke. Lots of it. Which always weirds me out coming from a non-smoking state. But whatever.  On the hunt for great cocktails in Vegas I was escorted here by my knowledgable guide (as well as on recommendation from friends and LV Yelpers) and it did not disappoint. The sleek bar is crazy stylish. I love the mirrored and flashy decor and the style of the space. The drinks themselves were expertly made. I opted for a dealer's choice which was good and a hanky panky, which was excellent. The skills of these bartenders are readily present in spades.   The only down-side? Expensive cocktails. $15 for a drink that would be $9 or $10 elsewhere. That's 50% extra - yikes! I get that I'm paying for the fancy surroundings but isn't that what the casino is supposed to pay for? I guess I'm in Vegas so I should just shut up and be thankful for such delicious cocktails, but 4 drinks on a tab that runs up to $55 without anything else is... yikes! Not a spot I'll be able to frequent. Especially when I can go a few blocks west and enjoy drinks on par for regular price.   I won't hesitate to come back here if I'm on the strip and want a good drink,  that's for sure. I'll just have to save up for it. And the price is the only reason this is not a full 5-star.

Would it be rude or pretentious of me to admit that I wouldn't find great food and cocktails in Scottsdale? Well, mea culpa. I honestly didn't expect much out of this city when it comes to comestibles. But Citizen Public House surprised me on all levels.   The cocktails here are crazy good. They even have a little 'speakeasy'-ish mixology lab upstairs that's all secret and only accessible by... wait... can I tell? Anyway, these folks are making some interesting drinks with house-made infusions, tinctures, and various chemistry equipment. Better than the best drinks in PDX? I don't know about that, but impressive all the same.   The food is a very big surprise for me. The chop chop salad is, from what I understand, legendary, and from tasting it I am not surprised. I also sampled some tasty meatloaf and delicious scallops. The fact that I can't recall the dessert doesn't mean it wasn't memorable, I think it had to do with my focus on the drinks and mains. I recall everyone at the table enjoying them.   Service? Impeccable. 'Nuff said.   Consider me a little humbled.

Holy crap!   Massive wine selection? Check. Bottles I've been craving but thought were only available in Italy? Check check. Organized by not only varietal and style but also a section for top-rated wines (for ease of quick shopping)? Checkmate.   Oh, and the prices? Totally reasonable.   I wish we had something like this in Portland.

I could say I'm pretty jaded when it comes to Thai food, but that would give the wrong impression. I try to walk in to every restaurant with a completely open mind. Because more often than not, especially when using Yelp, I find myself pleasantly surprised. Also I think that our expectations can completely control our ultimate experience in every aspect of our lives, so going light on expectations is a sure fire way to enjoy life more.   That said, I am a little spoiled, coming from Portland Oregon, with our insanely good Thai food. And Le Thai did not disappoint. I was shepherded here by Nate M, the local Vegas CM, and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. I sampled a few dishes and was impressed by all of them. They don't hold back on the spice level, the service is solid, the venue is cozy and vibrant, and the gin n' tonics are plenty strong. The menu does have a few interesting dishes I don't often see at your run-of-the-mill joints. And to top it all off, there's a Yelp check-in offer for a free hug.   I saved my hug for the next visit.

Party on a bike! It's the literal name for what in effect the Soul-Cycles of the world are. Except here aside from blacklights, candle-lights and no-lights, they add in various colored lights changing in rhythm, actual pitch-blackness, and funky laser stars. Otherwise it's similar in style to the average second-wave (or is it third-wave) spin class. Loud music, riding in time, pushups on the bike, etc... The new student cost is $10, and shoes come with it. They use the smaller size clips (if you are thinking of bringing your own shoes) and they also have slip-in toe-clip style - so you can technically wear regular shoes.   Overall it was a good sweat, and the instructor was great. My only complaint is the bikes - not a fan of the LeMonde bikes. I prefer the Schwinn-style spin bikes. Also the SPD or Look Delta clips. Better energy transfer than those little bitty clips.   Otherwise, great spin class and I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm in the hood!

I rent a lot of cars in a lot of cities, and while I normally try to avoid chains, it can be hard to do in places like Phoenix. That said, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience at Sixt.   First plus - walking past a humungous line at Fox Rent A Car (probably at least an hour wait) to a 4-person-deep line at Sixt - I was at the counter within 10 minutes.   Second plus - my service was fast, friendly and on point. No arguing or pushing about insurance when I declined, no surprises. Just exactly what I ordered at the exact price I booked. I was away from the counter within about 3 minutes of walking up to it. Also I got a free upgrade to a Nissan Sentra.   Third plus - The car was clean and ready to rock when I got down to the desk. No waiting, no BS.   Fourth - The car worked great.   Returning the car was even easier - drive up, drop it, walk away. Easy-peasy.   I'll easily rent from Sixt again.

Velveteen Rabbit is everything I like in a bar. It's casual, interesting, unpretentious, friendly, and most important, they make amazing drinks. Even more important is the latter combined with the former, since in so many cases amazing drinks are served up with a double dose of snoot. Not here. These folks are legit.   This little hole in the wall has a definitely grimy feel to it. I wouldn't have been slightly surprised to find a dive bar occupying this space. But instead they are slinging out some pretty interesting craft cocktail concoctions. And not only classics. They are making things up that please the palate and put your head on swirl. And beyond the delicious flavors, the prices are very right.   While the space itself seems a bit unpolished, they have some really interesting art, like an installation based on a projection on one of their walls with flaking paint, and a nice piece back near the bathrooms. And possibly the most endearing to me was the graffiti on the bathroom stall wall that simply proclaimed "Fuck your selfies".   Yup. I like this place. It reminds me just a little tiny bit of my home base in Portland, but it's different. It fits this town much better. And by this town, I mean the real LV, beyond the strip.

Alaska was my preferred carrier on the west coast until I decided to make the jump to loyalty program for a much larger network. I always have liked Alaska's level of service, however, and if I'm flying somewhere that's more convenient for Alaska's routes, then it's my top pick. For PDX-LAS - my normal carrier requires a two-leg journey, which is stupid. So Alaska is my go-to. They have multiple non-stop flights per day, and at least some of the planes have been updated with the new power outlets at every seat. And of course gogo in flght wifi.   While airline service across the board is a mere shadow of what it used to be, as far as the current standards go, Alaska still wins in my book... unless you put it up against Virgin, which has pretty rad service too. That said, the folks who work these flights are nice and friendly. As much as the seat sizes and baggage nonsense make it feel like cattle call in Economy, the crews on the ground and in the air don't contribute to it at all. And when flying to and from LAS, where it seems the majority of people don't listen or can't understand basic rules/etiquette, they offer a firm display of reminders that I wish all gate agents would. Like turning people away from boarding when they're trying to board ahead of their group. Or not letting people with rollers on in the group that's supposed to be boarding without rollers. My one main gripe with boarding is that they do offer earlier boarding to people who only have bags that will fit under the seat. Guess what? Those people still mostly put those bags in overhead. Frankly if they offered gate-check where I could get my bag at the gate on the other end, I'd be happy to send my roller below. But otherwise it's all out battle for those overheads.   Aside from my main issue with their boarding processes, I dig the rest of the way they do things at Alaska. And I'll keep digging it... especially on this route.

I've been golfing for decades. This means I've hit balls at driving ranges varying from the run-down municipal necessities all the way up to fancy, all-grass, manicured country club ranges. But Topgolf? This takes things to the next level. I've never done it like this.   Chipped balls? Computerized leaderboards? Multiple game styles? Up to 5 players per tee? Couches, drink service, and decent food? Yeah. This place is dope.   Topgolf is not the kind of place I'd go just to practice golf. Too impractical and too expensive. Also too crazy packed. But it's definitely a place I'd go with friends for a couple of hours of fun. Or, as on a recent visit, for something like a team-building offsite. It's so much fun that even non-golfers can enjoy it.   There's not a lot more that I can say. Make a reservation and go today. I hear one is coming to Portland, Oregon. I'm stoked about that!

An up-converted campus hotel with a hyper-specific theme? Seems like one of those old tropes that's a recipe for mediocrity. But the folks behind The Graduate nailed it. It's not just the slick design elements, the cool branding, or the fact that it has a sunny pool. What really makes this hotel shine is the attention to detail.   First off, my room was CLEAN. That's better than I can say for a lot of hotels I stay in, and I stay in a ton of decently expensive hotels. Really, I could end the review there. Clean rooms are hyper important. But on top of the cleanliness, the rooms were cozy, comfortable, well appointed, and had all the features a traveler would need. Free wifi, mini-fridge in the room, TV, desk, plenty of charging options, shower (bonus -with a door that closes - learn something, SF hotels!), and friendly front desk staff. The style of decor? Totally fun. And the carpet! That merits a nice review on its own. Great carpet designs all over the hotel.   The pool is small, but it does the trick. You can get drinks from the bar at the pool. And as a bonus, it's open 24 hours.   Only real downside is the lack of substantial fitness room, but I'm told they'll give you a pass to use the ASU facilities just down the street. Bonus!   Loved my stay here. Would definitely return!

The Yard has a lot going for it. This sprawling food+fun complex houses a restaurant, bar, event space, and outdoor patio filled with games like ping pong, cornhole, shuffleboard, and more. It's this strange mix of upscale, chic, and laid-back party vibe at the same time. But it works on many levels, and my visit left me pleasantly surprised.   First off, the food. I had the opportunity to sample a few things on the menu here, and was at times seriously impressed, and at times underwhelmed. First off, the pretzel bites with cheese fondue? Probably the best version of this I've ever had. Soft, warm, fresh-baked pretzel balls and a little fondue pot? Oh yeah. Bring it. However the staff-recommended fried chicken was merely passable. For a house specialty, it left me a little wanting. I tried some bites of a few other things that ranged from very solid to just okay.   The service here is friendly, organized and on point. We had a large group and were well taken care of. The interior space shows off the serious cash spent outfitting it. Dark with fun lighting, TV's showing sports, and a loud, lively atmosphere. The indoor/outdoor structure of the place (only in a place like AZ) creates a nice open flow. Outside on the covered "patio", the feel is more "upscale tailgate party" with tons of games and beverages. There's also another large bar area in the back that seems to be for either VIP, special occasions, or exceedingly busy nights.   This is totally a place I'd go with my bros to catch a game, some drinks and food. The games in the back make for a convivial atmosphere, and provide patrons with something to do other than just guzzle booze.   I dig it.

With a name like The Montauk I expect to be chilling out on an Atlantic ocean-front boardwalk with a lobster roll or some similarly-styled east coast fare. And frankly, that's kind of the feeling you get when dining here, despite the fact that you're in downtown Scottsdale. The open-air feel, cool color palate, and fast-casual attitude prop this all up.   We stopped in for lunch in a large group, and I got to sample the cauliflower fried rice with lobster for my meal. It's a tasty, creative take on fried rice, with that classic American-Chinese fried rice flavor. And low carb! Woot! The lobster was an add-on, and they definitely were not shy with the meat. The lobster roll looks tasty as well.   Service was on point, and while the food did take quite a while to come out, I'm imagining that it was my group of 7's large order that made it so. Otherwise it was a solid experience and I'd definitely return.

The Saguaro is not what I expected.   This converted hotel is a mix of hip, colorful and southwest with a dash of pool party mixed in.  I guess from the photos I wasn't expecting this spot to have as much of a "party" vibe as it does, and that's a pleasant surprise to me.   The upsides to this hotel are the service, color and flair. From the lobby decked out in a midcentury-modern/southwest feel complete with vintage Arizona Highway magazines scattered about to the yellow-and-orange poolside cabanas to the mod rooms, it's a mish-mash of boutique hotel design styles all thrown in to one. The front desk is helpful and all smiles, as are the valets. You can tell by walking through the pool area that they host plenty of parties, but the pool itself is huge - nice and long but never too deep. Perfect for a mass of people.   The rooms are comfy and decent-size, equipped with showers, tubs, comfy king beds, flat-screens, free wi-fi, some vintage/mod accents, a desk area and some decent quality soaps/lotions. Each room has an air conditioner, safe, fridge and lighted closet space. Oh, and there is plenty of purple carpet around. The pathways are outdoors, which kind of sucks in the Scottsdale heat, but the air con keeps the rooms themselves cool enough.   What knocks this hotel up a notch for me is the permissive vibe of the staff. Numerous times we were in the pool well past "closing" and as long as we were behaving ourselves they didn't seem to care that we were there. Instead of the usual hotel SS that kicks you out the moment it's supposed to be closed, we were in the pool and hot tub as late as 1am with no consequence. Also, the hotel is a block off of Old Town Scottsdale, with lots of stuff to do.   Also in the hotel are a whiskey bar and Distrito, a fairly stylish restaurant with pretty decent food. The bar has a great happy hour with $6 old fashioned cocktails (a good price for a hotel bar) and the pool offers a bar during daytime hours as well.   I'd totally stay here again, especially at the price we paid. Dig it.
