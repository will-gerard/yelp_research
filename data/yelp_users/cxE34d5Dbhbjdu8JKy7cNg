Delicious! I've eaten inside the restaurant however I usually order take to go. They do not deliver which is a bummer. The food is always quick to come out and the service is always prompt and courteous. With large portions.

Garlic knots, pizza, cheesecake and child entertainment?!? Yes please! Great food. Very nice staff. Most importantly,..they hand out paper plates and crayons to the kids. I don't know why this keeps kids busier than a coloring page. But it does. My four year old looks at these paper plates with amazement in her eyes. Like she has a score to settle. Is it because paper plates are foreign to our household? Maybe. All that matters is she  quietly concentrates while carefully coloring every piece of her paper plate. Who would have thought! Peace and quite the entire time it took to receive our food.  Then the waitress hung her paper plate picture on the wall among various other plates colored by children whose parent undoubtedly love this restaurant as well. What a great idea.  Oh yeah, the food is amazing.

Food is really good. It does get crowded on the weekends. I especially love the little farm stand outside of the coffee house on Saturday. Try the oro blanco grapefruit from said stand.

Such a great steakhouse. Beautiful ambiance. The blue cheese crusted filet is my favorite. The wine list is great. Everyone is nice. But I guess when your spending $100 for one meal they should be right?!?

Every single time I go thru this drive thru it takes 5-10 minutes. Apparently I like punishment because I was there yesterday and not only did it take 10 minutes to go thru the drive thru but the Barista made me repeat my order three times at the Intercom. Then I pull up to the window and she screws up my coffee not ONCE but TWICE! I pay well over $5 for my coffee. I expect it made the way I like and I expect it in a timely manner. Katie not only eff'ed my coffee in the A but she rolled her eyes at me while she was pounding it out and didn't even apologize. Screw Katie the Barista!

I've been coming here for 2 years now. I just brought my girls in today and they were able to accommodate both girls at the same time. That is impressive! Everyone is so nice. Just a pleasure to deal with. Dr. H is a very nice man. Always in a great mood. The frame prices are very reasonable for name brands. Love this place.

The women here who work the counters are inpatient, easily aggravated and lack basic communication skills. I never expected to have a nice experience at the DMV. That is why I try to do all of my applicable business online. Then my daughter turned driving age . From the Asian lady at the front counter who gives you the numbers to the fast moving insensitive ladies at the back counter this place is so disorganized. Seriously, the lady who gave us a number did not give us the correct paperwork. We waited our 40 minutes to be called. Angela at counter 20 advised us that we had the incorrect paperwork. Which was not our fault. She then proceeded to argue with me as if it was I who screws this up. She then told me we would have to go back to the first counter to get a different number and wait again! As if my time was not as important as hers. I argued with her and seriously fought the urge to "pop off". She ultimately conceded defeat and walked me up to the first counter to repeatedly point out the First Ladies error. Then she sat me down with Tamera.  This is when things calmed down. Tamera is probably the nicest most patient person within 8 miles of this place. She spoke sweetly and explained everything thoroughly. Seriously, she is a valuable employee and made my daughter feel much better about this entire process. Tamera you rock. Do not let this place jade you!

So good!!! The dark chocolate is a favorite of mine. There's usually a long line but that's because people sample way too many flavors. Went there last week and the girl taking our to go order left our bag with gelato on the back counter behind her to melt. She assumed someone else was going to give it to me. So after a few minutes went by I brought it to the cashiers attention and she apologized profusely. This was probably just a one time incident. We will definitely go back.

Every time I go through the drive thru I'm waiting for at least 20 minutes. I thought this was a fluke at first but tried a couple more times with the same result. Which sucks cause they are the only Starbucks with a drive thru by my house. Most of the time I have my toddler with me and don't want to have to get her in and out of her car seat.

Delish! The apple blossoms are different then the typical crab puffs. They are actually kind of sweet tasting. The orange chicken is amazing. Prices are average and they don't deliver. Everyone who works here is very nice.

I'm in LOVE with this place. The Mediterranean salad is delish. As is the flour-less chocolate cake. Super friendly staff and nice atmosphere. The only complaint I have is that I can not find any of the nutritional information online nor do they have it in the restaurant.

Don't order to-go from this restaurant. Unless you want to receive half the portion and trash for food. We ordered two salads, sweet potato fries and onion shoe strings to go. First off the salads mayyybeee had a half cup of greens. Apparently it's appropriate to put hot chicken and hot eggs on top of a cold salad?!?! By the time the salad got home (I live 3 minutes away) the lettuce was wilted hot and resembled cooked spinach. But I was hungry so I started to eat it. Then I pulled out the onion shoe strings and my face turned red with anger. The cup that they were in was LITERALLY half full and the shoe strings were sitting in a puddle of grease!!!! I must repeat...a puddle of grease!!!! See the below picture. I wish I would have taken a picture of the salad before I started eating it. Moral of the story?!? I paid $23 to still be hungry and have a stomach ache. Awesome.

The concept is a little odd but I'm not disappointed. Their sugar cookies are to die for!!! It's family owned which I love because your supporting local businesses. Try the herbal blackberry iced tea!

Omg! This tiny pizzeria is connected to a Froyo shop! The pizza is delicious and not too expensive. The employees are so nice. No long wait. The decor is adorable and who can beat a pizzeria connected to a froyo place?!?  It's a small pizzeria, so if there's a lot of people it can get cramped. Totally worth it!

I went during lunch time at the recommendation of a coworker when they first opened. I now eat here at the minimum 3 times a week. It's refreshing and delicious. The staff are always so nice. The ingredients are fresh. The best salad place I've ever been to!
