Very friendly staff and got me out of there as fast as they could. Vacuum job was pretty good but didn't get in the crevices like I was hoping but what can I expect - it's not the car wash. Have purified water and judge Judy going so that was pretty good if you ask me compared to the Econo Lube down the road where the tattooed man was calling me sweetheart with a creepy grin!

This was a terrible experience. Seriously, I don't know why I went here or why this place is so popular. My grandmother had the seafood entree and it was pathetic, the shrimp looked like little chunks of deep fried bread. I made the mistake of getting the boca burger because i thought a burger establishment as well known as Red Robin could make it could - totally opposite. They have no idea how to make it taste good. It was actually gross! It looked like a sponge and tasted like a sponge. I have been to tons of restaurants who serve meat and also make amazing veggie burgers: Pita Jungle, Islands, The Counter. If you want your restaurant to be a success and make your customers happy then make every single menu item good quality and tasty - otherwise your wasting people's time and money because they could of gone somewhere else. They should take those things off the menu until they can figure it out.

Not good for vegans for vegetarians. They don't serve breakfast on the weekdays which was why I went there. Not good for kids. Good for meat eaters who want a bar.

Black bean burger is amazing; pita chips and hummus are to die for; iced tea great; vegetables are never cooked all the way thru (raw and crunchy when they should be tender); fans on when it's cold outside and they should be off (may have been a fluke). I'll still come back ;)

I don't recommend it. The waiter, who clearly has no serving experience gave us very poor service. It took forever to get our drinks, he stood around and talked while we were all waiting to order, and he started his side work after our food was delivered and never checked in with us (when people needed additional things delivered). The local vegetable pizza was bland and boring. The artichoke pizza was pretty good but shouldn't of been ruined with a bunch of green olives (which seems to be their vegetable topping of choice). Their pizzas are small and overpriced. Their caesar salad was ruined with celery. I desperately wanted some dipping sauce (like marinara or vodka) to go with the large amounts of crust I was left with but never got the opportunity to ask; since I never saw our waiter again till our check came. The only chance of me coming back is for happy hour when I can get an inexpensive glass of wine.

I like this place a lot - I couldn't decide what to get so I got their basic breakfast (2 eggs scrambled, soy chorizo, hash browns and I substituted the toast for one of their sweet potato pancakes) with coffee. First off - I want to thank them for having faux meat and soy milk for my coffee. That is extremely difficult to come by and I can't tell you how many places don't have soy milk. I was actually worried that the sweet potato pancake was going to be too sweet bc of the caramel (which I don't even like) but it was made to perfection. The hash browns had a unique and flavorful seasoning to them. The coffee was very hot. And the portions were a perfect size. Overall this place is very good because of their wide variety of unique options and cool interior design. I plan to come back next time I'm in town.
