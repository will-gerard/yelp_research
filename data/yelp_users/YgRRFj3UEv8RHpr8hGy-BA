I had the teriyaki chicken, which was pretty good and very flavorful. The cashier, who seemed to be the owners son, was rude and could not crack a smile or thank me for my business. He loudly spouted off his views on gun control, which I think as an associate was inappropriate. He also got into a verbal disagreement with the customer ahead of me due to the fact that the associate would not get off the phone with his father to assist the paying customer. He yelled at the customer and was extremely disrespectful. I didn't appreciate the way I was treated, and I can certainly find a chicken teriyaki elsewhere.

A very cozy and quaint little restaurant with truly delicious sushi! The staff are always very kind and welcoming, and their prices are incredibly reasonable. Happy hour is everyday until 6:30. Best sushi in the valley!

This is truly a diamond in the rough. It's a cute, non-descript building on the corner of 15th ave & Thomas that you've probably driven past a hundred times. Do yourself a favor and stop in for an inexpensive, absolutely delicious lunch or dinner. Their mu shu wraps are essentially asian burritos and they are not to be missed. The staff/owners are so sweet and friendly, I would return just to chat with them! Great food and great service, what more could you want?

I'm just so curious to find out if their customer service training actually tells them to blatantly ignore customers or if that's just something they came up with all on their own. No, no, I'm sure your gossip about other staff members is much more important than assisting me.

I absolutely love the food here. I've never tasted anything I don't 100% love. The Tokyo ramen with beef is my go to, but the Shoyu and Tonkotsu ramens are delicious as well. The location is great, and the hours aren't bad. I do kind of wish they were open a bit later, I think they'd do well with all the college kids in town!  My only downside to this place is the service. For the most part, you encounter rude, blank staring college kids who are counting down the minutes until their shifts are over. I've never had the pleasure of being greeted by someone friendly! I return for the food, but the service needs a serious improvement.

My roommate and I made an appointment for 5:45 when they closed at six, and they were kind enough to stay open until 6:30 to finish our nails. The salon was very clean, and our nail techs were nice and efficient. We both got fills on our acrylics and were shocked at the reasonable bill of $15. We will definitely be returning!

I ordered delivery from Saigon Pho and was very impressed! My rare beef pho was hot and absolutely delicious, the service was friendly, and delivery was fast. Great value for the food as well. I will definitely be trying this restaurant dine-in for the full experience!

My roommate and I decided to try this place for a late brunch on a Saturday.  The wait was about 40-50 minutes but that was something we expected. Luckily they text you when your table is ready so we did a bit of shopping while we waited. Our waitress was really nice and attentive despite the morning rush. I ordered the Ham Benedict III which was absolutely delicious, and my roommate had the Sandwich I Am which was also very tasty. Both came with hash browns that were amazing! It was a tiny bit loud, but otherwise a very pleasant atmosphere!  Overall a great experience, I will definitely be back.
