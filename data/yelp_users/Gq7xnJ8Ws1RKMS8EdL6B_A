I gave Moto a few tries because it was the closest sushi place to where I was living (would get it for take out).  Each time I was mildly disappointed....sushi is medicore, nothing really stood out to me.  Their salmon sashimi is smoked, wierd in my opinion being a sashimi lover.  Wish I could them better, but not impressed.

My fav breakfast place in Phoenix!  You get: great food, great atmosphere, good service (parking a little bit of a challenge, but I live right across the street so I just walk).  They even have drive up take out service!  I mostly eat the breakfast there but have had sandwiches as well as the pizza at the Pizzeria next door.  Delicious!  Anyone who gives LGO negative reviews has just fallen into the usual boring Phoenix restaurant style type eating.  LGO is something different...order and serve yourself....kinda' like fast food (but you have to wait a little bit because all the food is made fresh), but seat yourself and don't have to worry about waiting for a server to bring your drinks/food!  Coffee is great (and strong). Daybreaker is my favorite healthy breakfast choice (egg white with turkey slices, avacado, tomato and salsa....get with a side of fruit or potato...fantastic!)  Yes, prices are a little higher than average in Phoenix....but you get what you pay for.  We love coming here after a good hike at Squak Peak or Camelback! Fresh squeed OJ is great and fresh made english muffines are yummy.

My favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix! Food is consistently delicious...atmosphere is great (fun and alive crowd almost all the time.....despite others saying it's just full of douchebags/sugar daddys and cougars.....if you're not out just to judge, then you should be fine)....service is good....happy hour and reverse happy hour on the week-end is THE BEST!   Love it.

This restaurant has THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!! My boyfriend organized a wonderful birthday dinner for me with a group of 23 people at Bobby's. As people arrived the server not only didn't introduce himself but did not even offer people arriving a drink. My friends were going up to the bar to get their drinks. Water was not topped off and it took 2 hours before anybody got any of their food. When people complained to the manager she was rude and defensive and didn't seem to care. My boyfriend also had a friend make cupcakes for everybody and they had the gaul to charge $1 per person per cupcake just to serve them!! After spending so much money there as a group I find it unfathomable that a restaurant would do this. The server (and manager) made it seem like we were the first large group that ever were to frequent their establishment, with the server telling us he didn't want to take orders without knowing who was going to be on separate checks. And even after saying that at the beginning and appearing to have it organized, all my friends at the end of the night were literally in line at their cash register telling them what they ordered so they could separate it from he bill. WTH is this Denny's or what?!?! To top it off, we were short over $200 at the end of he night and the manager refused to itemize the bill for us so we could see what wasn't paid for. My friends are not cheap and there is no way we were short that amount of money....pretty sure they eff'd the bill up by not subtracting people as we went along.   The only saving grace was that most of the food was pretty good (I had the Lobster ravioli and my boyfrIend had the clam linguini)..my friends who ordered the burgers said they were awful so maybe stay away from them. I asked them if they told the waiter about the burgers and they said nobody once asked how their food was. Figured. The owner of this restaurant really needs to re-evaluate he staff before this restaurant sinks hard and fast!

This place has the best greek food I've tried this far in Phoenix.  I'm originally from a city that has a fabulous greek town so I know my greek!  The owner is from Greece.   If you're looking for something fancy, then you should go elsewhere, it's more of a fast food type restaurant.  But you will not be dissappointed in the food!  Delicious large servings, decent prices, great service. They even have a drive through, but better to call ahead to place your order as it could take a while to prepare (well worth the wait).

I had a great experience with these guys...as it seems everybody else has as well!  Chad who I booked the move with was honest and informative on the phone.  I was able to save money by moving during the week and was also able to book my move for the next day (my move was a small one, so would give yourself more booking time for a larger move).  The guys who moved me were in contact with me to advise of what time they would be arriving.  They arrived on time and got right to work, completing my move in the estimated time they had quoted me.  Very satisfied with their service...they were efficient, professional and punctual.  Thank you for helping me keep my sanity during something I HATE doing...........moving!

I love this pilates studio! Bought the 10 class groupon here and will definately be continuing to attend once it is up. The instructors and managers here are so nice and friendly and do a great job of remembering your name and treating you like one of the pilates fam! Ive only done the reformer classes so I can't speak to the yoga and other classes, but those pilates reformer machines are legit! I honestly don't think there is a better core body workout out there. If you stick with it, you will definately see a change in your body. The regular prices for the classes are a little pricier than other studios, but there are only 8 of the machines, so classes are small and the instructors give you individualized instruction and really make sure you are doing the right technique. The studio is clean and modern as well. I highly recommend this studio...give it a try you won't be disappointed!!

Great little thai spot!  Old Wendy's restaurant that has beeen converted into a quaint, nicely decorated, dimly lit little spot.  I have tried 5 dishes from here and they have all been FABULOUS!  Full of flavor and spice.  I've tried the Pad Thai, Cashew Chicken, Shrimp Basil, Thai Green Curry and Choo Chee Seafood (oh and the Crispy Thai Rolls) and they have all been great.    Hard to come by good Thai in Phoenix, but I hope this place sticks around!  Excellent service as well. My only complaint would be that the music they were playing could have been a little more upbeat for a Friday night  :-)  Will be coming back again and again.

Ann is fabulous and Phoenix glow is the BEST!!! My spray tan with her always turns out smooth and last for a good minimum of a week without any crazy blotchy fading. Ann is so great and professional and will cater your tan to the specifics of how you like it.  Definitely check her out, you will not want to see anyone else!!

David did an amazing job replacing a light fixture in my bathroom. He was efficient, professional and personable. My only complaint is that it took a while for the company to get back to me to set a date for the work but it turns out it was because the fixture was so old (from the 60's) they had to order it and it took a while to receive. Simple Electric was very reasonable and I would definitely use them again.

I've been in a few times to the Nook now and have never been disappointed! The Diavolo pizza is ahhhmazing (perfect spice, great tasting thin crust right from the wood fired oven), and they have Poutine (fries with gravy and cheese on them)!  I'm Canadian and you don't see poutine on any menu down here very often. It's not your legit Quebec poutine (the Nook uses crumbled cheese instead of cheese curds), but it is tasty and satisfies my craving for sure!   Last time we were in Nick was our server and he was fantastic...very funny and very attentive. Oh and they even have happy hour on Sunday! $5 glasses of wine, $2 off cocktails and cheaper appetizers. We love this neighborhood spot, it has charm and a great atmosphere ...check it out!
