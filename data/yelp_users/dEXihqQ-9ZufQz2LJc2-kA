I usually don't like writing negatives or bad reviews, but this hotel (or should I say motel) is pretty disgusting. It's an old, rundown, awful smelling establishment located off the Las Vegas strip.   I was passing through town for a short night and needed a place to crash. They were understaffed and check in desk was slow. The garden room I was placed in looked like a crack motel from a horror movie and there were stains all over the carpet. The garden rooms building consist of 2 floors with no elevator so be prepared to haul your luggage up a creaking flight of stairs. The only reason why I agreed to stay here was to try the Oyster Bar. My weakness is food as you can tell.  I probably will never step foot in this place again. Sorry Palace Station but I rather take my chances elsewhere.

A small fast food, family owned establishment ideally for takeout or delivery. Upon our arrival we opted to dine in here. Our order was taken immediately and our food was served promptly. Everything came out to taste. Their portions are huge. I had the house special chicken with lo mein that could of feed 2 people. My meal also came with an eggroll and 3 fried wonton. The next time I'm in town, I'll have to try the beef chow fun which my sister said was satisfying.

Las Vegas Premium Outlet North is the best outlet center in the Las Vegas area that offers high fashion at an affordable price. Some great stores are 7 For All Mankind, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana, Joe's Jeans, Kate Spade, Salvatore Ferragamo, True Religion and my personal favorite, Tory Burch.....Yes ladies, Tory Burch which is always my first go to store when I visit this center.   The only downfall is that it is located outdoors, which can be unbearable during the summer heat when it's in the 3 digit degree. Overall, it is an outstanding outlet center with great finds.

A tiny oyster bar located inside The Palace Station hotel off the strip. There are only 18 seats available so be prepared for a long wait. I've heard great things about this place so it was a must try when in Vegas. I arrived around 10:00 on a Saturday night and wasn't seated till midnight. The 2 hour wait wasn't that bad since I was running back and forth to the Irish pub across the way for drinks.   I opted for the Palace Pan Roast with shrimp, crab, chicken and andouille sausage level 8 spicy. HOLY MOLY, this dish was super delicious!! Every bite was pure creamy heaven with succulent shrimps and the flavorful andouille sausage just made it that much better. I licked my bowl clean. It was that good and totally worth the 2 hour wait.

This location is well kept. The isles are nice and clean which makes it easy to find what you need. Wide alcohol selection also which is a plus in my book.

I was in town visiting and I decided to go get a pedicure before I hit a night on the town. The staffs were super nice and conversational. It was large, airy and clean. Spa chairs were extra comfy. I got white French tips where I could tell they use quality polish where it didn't chip till about 2 weeks later. Unlike some other nail salons where they use cheap polish and it chips the next day. Great service!

A charming establishment with an old country feel. We were warmly greeted at the door to submit our name on the waiting list. While waiting to be seated at our table, we decided to browse around the county store which had some neat merchandise you don't see often nowadays. Looking at all their candy, sweets and soda pops from the earlier years reminded me of my childhood. It was a nice trip down memory lane.  Service was great, food arrived promptly and our dishes were to taste. Defiantly a great breakfast or brunch spot for all ages.

I was in town visiting and I decided to go get a pedicure before I hit the mall next door. The staffs were super nice and conversational. It was large, airy and clean. Spa chairs were extra comfy and I almost fell asleep while getting my feet massage. I got white French tips where I could tell they use quality polish where it didn't chip till about 2 weeks later. Unlike some other nail salons where they use cheap polish and it chips the next day. Great service!

Hands down, the best tacos around! This location has expanded recently. They took over the suite to the right side of them so it made my last experience less hectic with faster order lines and more seating. The outside patio has double in size also.   Onto the food. Ooh...Mee...Gee! The adobada (spicy pork) is to die for, carved off a huge slab of flavored pork rotating inside of a flame roasting cooker. Every bite was bursting with flavor and the green guacamole cilantro sauce on top just made it that much better.    If you rather op for something other than tacos then no need to worry. They offer other items on the menu like tostadas or quesadillas. I also love the nacho fries with either adobada or carne asada meat. For those of you that can't decide between the 2 then make it a half and half. Mmmm....I could just smell the food now. DROOL!

This is my favorite store in the Las Vegas Premium Outlet North center. They have a fairly good selection of merchandise to pick from. The last time I visited this location, they were having a 20% off Spring sale event going on which has never happened before. So, I was forced to walk out with bags of shoes and handbags. :-)  Superb customer service. Ask for Orlando Hill. He was awesome. Well educated with the merchandise and very informative. For items they didn't have in stock, he tracked it down at other locations and had it shipped to my home for free. They ran out of water on my last visit, so he kept loading me up on soda. He even stocked my bag with Cokes to go. Great shopping experience.

I love the fact that they offer online ordering and they also offer delivery for a small fee. I ordered my sister's birthday cake here and I must say, "Hands down, best cake ever!" It was super soft, moist, and the icing was on point. Some places overload their cake with frosting which can be to over powering. The sweetness of the cream cheese frosting made the perfect combination with the cake in every bit. Presentation was a plus also. Looked exactly like the online picture. I'm a fan of Nothing Bundt Cakes.

A fairly new outlet mall that's nested in the Westgate center and near the University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the AZ Cardinals. The location is ideal for a day spent shopping, dining and events but the outlet center itself lacks in entertainment. It is quite small and the store selection is limited.
