First time here- first impression was of a family owned diner, not too terribly busy at 10:00 am in a Sunday - no wait.    Waiter took my drink order as he seated me - good strong coffee!   I had the corned beef hash and eggs - hash browns  look like they are shredded in house -liked that.   Only downside was bathrooms weren't too clean and smelled like puke.    It's right around the corner so I'll probably be back!

Hey I'm a frequent shopper at this Frys-  it's my neighborhood store. However I had an experience today that makes this my forever store. Had a long day had to get some groceries, it's always a tedious chore. My checkout clerk    Whose name was Nanette really looked at me really asked me how I was doing and listened to my answer.  To top it off I got a $29 roast for nine dollars woo hoo woo hoo.!! Finally, I forgot my plant that I had picked out and went out to my car had finished loading all of my groceries and was about to drive away when nanette rushed out yelling at me to stop.   With my plant.    Go Frys!!!!!! Customer for life!!!!

Well, I am not an actual customer of MistAMERICA - however I felt led to write a review about one of the employees there I met this morning.  Lots of car problems lately - yesterday I stalled on Scottsdale Road and Mountain View and waited an hour an a half for AAA - in the heat - and not one person out of the literally hundreds of cars that passed - including two Scottsdale Police officers - stopped to help push the car out of rush hour traffic or ask if I was ok.    This morning, on Camelback Road, the same thing happened.  I almost started crying because I got sick from being out in the heat yesterday.  However, this time, a super nice young man named Greg stopped to ask if he could help push my car  - he did, then made sure I was ok before he left.  This guy restored my faith in humanity - gentlemanly, kind, and helpful.  MistAMERICA - you got a jewel with this man.   Would be happy to have him working for me any day.  And would not hesitate to recommend MA now that I know you have employees like him!!

Had to try Mel's - grew up on Alice     My first impression was 'this is a place that has a lot of regulars' and I know why!   Best pancakes I have had in a while - and as I ate, my impression was confirmed.   Waitresses knew so many customers by name and knew about their lives.   Very friendly fast and efficient.   Fun to see old photos on the wall too.

Katherine is awwwwwwwesome!   I have repeatedly bombarded her with questions and requests for advice regarding my new little granddaughter and I clean her out of onesies and sleepers and socks regularly.  Everything is spic and span and freshly washed and fresh smelling - and such great deals!!!!  I have gotten a bouncer, a swing, tons of books and toys, and everything I need for grandma visits!  LOVE this store!  Take a look if you are on Thomas!

This place is horrible.   Can't wait for my lease to be up.   Drugs, noise, fighting, barking dogs nonstop because they are left alone on a patio 24 hours a day. Common areas smell like dog pee and poop.

I have came here several times for gel nails and fills and was always happy with my service and nails.   That was why I chose wink and polish for a set of lash extensions      45 dollars and it was fast and painless.    I liked how they looked from far away but large dots of the glue looked pretty fake up close.    Worst of all less than 12 hours after I paid for them I woke up to find one in my pillow s d one half hanging off.   That wasn't the problem.   The problem came when I called to let the salon know what happened and cheerfully ask for a refund.    I was snottily asked if I had put my lashes in contact with wAter.   I repeated that one had fallen off in my sleep and the other was loose so I removed it.  I was informed that not only would I not get my money back, I couldn't even come in and get them reapplied unless I paid again!!!  The lady then said they could 'give me a discount' on another set.  I said no thank you.  But I am giving you a review on Yelp.   Silence.    No I'm sorry, no customer service.   They have lost a regular customer.
