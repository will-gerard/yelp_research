This review is for the wireless booth in the store.  Heard purchasing a phone here vs. through my service provider is cheaper and you get some extras like a case and a car charger. This is true, I believe I saved around $50 on the phone.  The complimentary case was cheap and I threw it in the trash. The car charger will definitely be useful.  The guys working the booth are very nice, helpful,and PATIENT. I witnessed them dealing with several non savvy wireless customers.  Why I won't buy here again...the supervisor running.the booth transferred my contacts over only after I asked him to do so. Then he transferred them over in some round about way so I had to accept all of my contacts 1 by 1, going through a menu page each time. After a couple of days I noticed some of my contacts didn't make it through the transfer. So to the Verizon store I go.to get the job done right. Plus at the Verizon store they go above and beyond explaining the basics of your phone before you leave.   I also had to wait a few days to get my phone. It was more than the 2 day delivery that they advertise. However this didn't bother me especially since I just saved some dough. The fact that I had to go back to the store to activate my phone didn't bother me either. The unefficient transferring of my contacts and no regard to explain anything about my phone did bother me.  Lesson learned, pay the extra money and get everything done the same day, and go home happy and complete.

We were on the hunt for an awesome carpet cleaner due to puppy training and ended up here. We waited a good length of time while the 1 sales associate helped a couple of other customers - it was the weekend. The wait was pretty long and I was getting antsy. Antsy enough to walk out but we stayed.  The guy was pretty good as far as demonstrating the various products that met our needs. He gave us a demo of a dry carpet cleaning system - NEATO, no more soggy socks or waiting for the carpet to dry with those other carpet cleaners.   The price tag on the carpet cleaning machine was pretty high, but we figured after paying to rent a system and buying the necessary cleaning solutions it would be worth the investment and it has been. We use the machine a ton.  The machine (as well as I'm sure many of their other products) comes with a 10 YEAR WARRANTY!!!! Just bring your item into the store and have it maintained! LOVE IT! During my many visits to the store to pick up the necessary cleaning solution I have seen other customers bringing in their products for upkeep. What a lovely service.  The machine is totally worth the money. It does an amazing job...way better than any of those wet carpet cleaners and even better than having our carpets cleaned by professionals! All that money wasted on those services when this little gem of a machine was waiting at the store just around the corner. Guess I should give ya'll the name of the machine, it's called the Orbital.  So happy with our product, the location of the store, and the expertise of the one-man show! .

Dallas was a beyond helpful associate at the store. After searching the malls I finally convinced my bf to check out this store. Great, individualized service! It was especially refreshing after dealing with the not so friendly or helpful department store associates. My bf was in a little bit of a bind, needing nice slacks for an upcoming interview. Luckily the Men's Wearhouse has finished bottoms in many sizes and the bf walked out with a couple of pairs of pants, socks, and a belt.  Of course, they pushed dress shirts and ties and shoes but with a simple, "no thanks" we moved on. Dallas made the shopping experience easy and quick. Give that man a raise!!!

Friendly!  Loving the Chunk Strawberry Topper!!! It has fresh cut bananas on top, strawberries, peanut butter, non fat yogurt, soymilk, pumpkin flax seed granola...sounds delicious right? Well it is. I would like to venture out and try the others like this but they sound kinda tart. There is a berry, mango, and acai topper...maybe next time.  On occasion I get the wheat grass shot for fun. It's nasty tasting but it is supposed to be good for ya.  Oh and fun seat dancing music while you wait.

So who wouldn't love a yummy piece of beef swimming in melted butter on a 500 degree plate?  C'mon it is so flippin delicious I don't know what to do with myself!!!!    My fav is the filet, med or med-rare...depending on my mood. My bf likes- no scratch that - LOVES the cowboy rib-eye! He is your typical, hard to please Texan when it comes to beef and admitted it is "the best steak he has even had." So there you have it. Top grade meat and over-priced wine and you have a winner.  Give the creme brulee a try. I, myself am not a huge fan of creme brulee but Ruth's Chris makes one to crave.

The breakfast is so dang good! I could rave about everything from breakfast to the pastry case but then this review would become ridiculous.   Coffee and tea are also delish. I'm telling you its all good!  We heard Jay-z playing today (Sunday), way to be hip LGO. :)

5 stars for the kolaches and the customer service! Sam the co-owner chatted it up with my boyfriend and I while we ate our kolaches at the counter.  My boyfriend is from Texas and knows his Kolaches. We've noticed the sign on the sidewalk and finally made it in. They claim it is the ONLY place dishing out the Texas Kolaches (I'll stand by that claim --we've been looking for Kolaches for awhile now). They serve up spicy sausage, regular, and spicy ham & jalapeno - all served with cheese, yes please. If you have never had a kolache it is similar to a pig-in-a-blanket amped up on yumminess.  They have an espresso machine and many donuts choices. I will be saving that experience for next time. Oh, and I also read someone's review on breakfast burritos - looking forward to that too.  It's an older place that reflects its age. With a little sprucing up it could the cutest and best donut/kolache shop in town!

We feel very welcomed here. Our dogs are spoiled rotten with belly rubs and kisses by all the vets and vet assistants!   We purchased the "puppy packages" for both of our dogs which includes all there needed puppy vaccinations, nail clipping, and poop check for $100.  You can request a particular vet at each visit or get one a random. They are all so friendly it will be hard to choose!   Dr. Sherl has been our pick so far. One of our dogs had to be sterilized fairly young due to a possible cancerous testicle. Our pup came out of the vet office in top-top shape.  It is quite a drive for us, about 30 to 40 mins but worth the trip for us given the excellent care our dogs receive.  Another plus is the amount of options given to you as far as how much a procedure can costs and the integrity of stating what kind of care plan is recommended for your dog breed.   I am very happy with the care and cleanliness of the office and will continue to make that drive for our pets!

Well, on this particular visit the associate in the men's department was pretty douchey. The associate was busy racking items and I guess did not see us approaching him as he walked back and forth putting clothes out. When we got close enough my bf asked him about a particular brand of clothing and with hardly any recognition replied in a rude and unprofessional manner. Really didn't make me or my boyfriend want to spend any money in this store. On to the next store :).

I am a SANDWICH FANATIC!!!!!  Sack's is one of my fav sandwich shops. It was my go to spot for lunch last semester at ASU. These days I can only afford to go on occasion. Great sandwiches just wish they would come down on their prices a bit to make it more pocket friendly.  Nice bonus if you "like" on fb as they offer free drinks from time to time. Oh, and the cookie you get with your sandwich is a nice touch. And there is also the punch card. 10th sandwich is free!  The impressionist and jazz are my fav sammies. One is a veggie and the other is bacon, turkey and avocado. The crew comes up with some pretty tasty sandwich specials, sometimes they sound crazy, but trust they will be delicioso!  Downside is parking. There's like 5 spots. Great option for students and ASU staff, not so much for passerbyers (try the Sack's on Hardy if you need to park).

Casey's totally transports you from being on campus all day into completely forgetting about anything that happened on campus that day.  It's a great little hang out for the college scene. Very close for those on the west side of campus, so close a group of us sometimes heads over between classes or at the end of a rough day to grab a drink and some grease.   So needless to say I have had a few of the items on the menu however, I haven't found something I really, really like. I've had the tuna bacon melt (overkill-too much grease), fries (yum, they put a sprinkle of parmesan), fried clams (good), turkey croissant (okay), zucchinis and mushrooms (good).   I think the patio really makes this place great. It is fun and welcoming. You could hang out here all day (in great weather that is).  They allow smoking, kinda sucks, but most people are respectful and blow up rather than at you. If you go during peak hours (weekends/nights) you might not be able to get a table as most people make a looooooong night of Casey's and usually stay put. Cheers!!!

We always ask for Gloria when we visit. She is a sweet, Hispanic lady who loves to call everyone "baby."  Of course, you get free chips and salsa. I love the salsa in the squeeze tube. It is freakin' addicting. The beef tacos, as well as, the sonoran enchiladas are my favorites. Beef taco is straight up yummy and on the greasy side, good amount of beef and cheese. The sonoran enchilada is a gordita with enchilada sauce, cheese, and green olives. Their rice and beans are pretty good. When we are all in a drinking mood we will grab a pitcher of Marg's.   Inside it is your typical Mexican decor - bright colors, Mexican pots and pictures, and that kinda thing.

This place is truly a common component in your diet if you grew up in the vicinity of a Pete's Fish n' Chips.   I've always ordered the fish n' chips, recently adding shrimp to the mix. The fish is in a rectangular shape and the breading is always a nice golden color. Pete's isn't doing anything fancy here and yet it has remained to be a local favorite since 1947! L-O-V-E the Pete's sauce (its pato sauce and ketchup.) and it's a great spicy ketchup kinda deal. Way better than any cocktail sauce. The fish and fries have a good amount of salt on them and I think that's all they use for seasoning. It's simple and good. The fish and shrimp can be a bit greasy, but it is to be expected when you are eating fried food. But I don't think it is nowhere near as greasy as its competitor Long John Silver.   Way back I know I've had the burritos and monster burgers, but given the name of a place you might wanna guess what is best to stick with.    I'll take Pete's over any other fish n' chip place!  Ps, It's CASH ONLY.

Highly disappointed. I have seen several shows to include travelling shows and Ka has got to be my least favorite of the Cirque du Soleil. I feel like it wasn't to the standard Cirque has set for its shows.   I do not blame the actors, they did their part. The show just needs a trip back to the drawing board.  However, there were a couple of very memorable scenes but they could not save the show.   My boyfriend fell asleep and he is a bigger fan of the shows then me. Also, judging by the audinence's reaction I can say that the majority of people were unimpressed as well. Very little clapping and zilch awe's and oh's.   There are built in speakers in the seats. Probably to keep you alert, which you will definitely need when watching this show. Unfortunately, it was not enough to keep my bf awake.   Upon entry into the theatre it looks as though some crazy shit is gonna  go down. There are several huge columns on either side from floor to ceiling but don't let that fool you, actors do a bit of swinging between the different levels, that's pretty much it.   Maybe if this is your first Cirque show you would be in love, but as for this girl I can say I am not. I wish I could recommend this show; it doesn't make me feel good to write a negative review... it just wasn't for me or the boyfriend.  Side note: Was the music and singing live? Not that it would have saved the show, but it is what I have come to expect when seeing these shows .

Love, love, love the pizza! The diavola is my fav- juicy & slightly spicy. My mouth is seriously salavating as I write this. I know it's strange for a pizza to be juicy, so let me explain...the fresh ingredients melting perfectly in the brick oven for an incredible burst of flavors in your mouth - JUICY!!! For apps I was introduced to the Burrata, which is outstanding and give the bruschetta and caprese a try, also yummy. Dessert wise the crepes with nutella are lip-smacking good as well as the nutella shake. (yep, I'm a fan of nutella)  Delightful atmosphere, patio lit with strands of lights, charming historic house inside.  Sometimes they have live music but I'm not sure how to find out this information. Also, they serve homemade pasta on a selected day :)

Hands down one of my TOP FIVE MEALS EVER!!!! Could not eat slow enough to savor every bite of the lobster gnocchi.   Yelped this place and so glad I did. The reviews were right on...for those that liked this place.   My boyfriend and I were seated along the walkway of the MGM. It was good for a little people watching. And as I am not a fan of second hand cigarette smoke I can say I didn't smell any of it.   Thursday evening before Ka meal...we did not have reservations and were seated right away.Served bread right away. The flatbread crusted with parmesan was delish. Tried the pineapple upside-down martini, it was just okay and sticky. My next martini was just the way I like it, straight up, and both were filled to the brim.   I give it a 4 star rating because of the service, however I really want to give it a 5 star just based on my dish. The service wasn't bad it just wasn't great either.   My boyfriend ordered the lasagna dish. He gave it 3 stars. You can tell it was fresh, down to the sauce however it was kinda of on the bland side.   Can not wait to go back. I will be trying the short rib ravioli (as others have suggested or the new halibut dish).

Always a great experience here! Nearly all the staff is knowledgeable about pet food and treats and what is recommended for your breed.  We bathe our dogs here regularly and they always leave so soft and fluffy and smelling great. The music and fun, vibrant colors on the walls makes it a fun place to cross off one of your weekend chores!  There is also a great selection of supplements.

First timers to this park on an early Sunday morning. Me, my bf, and our 2 old English bulldogs had a great experience.   You can choose between the active or passive dog park. We choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all.   We were immediately greeted by a woman and her 2 boxers, very friendly. We walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way.   We did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm, no foul.   Looking forward to bringing the dogs here again!

Perfect location for me to stop at on my way to ASU.   I have had a few instances where my drink is not crafted according to my modifiers but the baristas have corrected it everytime with no hesitation.   The crew here is always upbeat and pleasant. The speed of service is superb! Do not pass this drive-thru by because of the line of cars, they are very fast.

Still a fan!  This time around I tried the Chicken Hummus Platter. DE-lish!   I phoned in the order with no problems. The chicken had a nice seasoning to it and their  hummus is simply wonderful! I don't know why I didn't try this place out sooner.   The word is that this place "tastes healthy" but I think it is perfect! For being a "healthy" eatery it sure does have MAS flavor!!!

It's a nice looking Fry's with a specialty section for cheeses and sushi. They have a sushi chef preparing sushi daily!   The parking lot can be a mad house and elderly women beware and hold your purse's close. They have security for the shopping complex and there is always security (an off-duty cop) for Fry's but people still manage to get taken advantage of. There is usually someone roaming the parking lot wanting food or money.   I think Fry's can be a bit pricey but I'd rather shop here than Wal-Mart for food. The store is nice and clean.   On busy weekends/holiday's the produce section tends to run out of certain items but the rest of the store stays well stocked. The Deli line can be out of control, if you know what you want and what your item tastes like you can order from the kiosk as soon as you walk in the store and just stop by and pick it up when you're ready, talk about convenience!

Yeah, i'm gonna go ahead and down-grade my rating from my previous review. The lack of awareness and attention you get as a customer is very inadequate. I have ordered take out and dined in since my last review and just wasn't pleased at all. 1. with the quality of the food and 2. with their customer service.  Another long wait until our server showed up. I wanted to leave but my I didn't want to be like that. It is just ridiculous to me that it would take soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo long for anyone to address you once seated.   I won't miss this place too much aside from the Bacon Won Tons. oh, well.

Only place in town (that I know of) that carries a particular brand of wipes that I need for my dog. I have a highly sensative pup that can only have his behind wiped with hypo-allergenic wipes (go-figure, but anything for my dog, right :)   That being said the store focuses on healthy foods and treats, suppliments, and other care products that are eco-friendly. Makes you feel good shopping here and forking out that little extra bit of cash.  The women I have found are more helpful then the man working here.   Also, love how they decorate the store for the holiday's! And the toy selection is AWESOME!!!! You can find really great gifts here for your doggies.

Probably mine & my bf's 7th time frequenting this establishment. From the mixed berry protein waffle to the chorizo eggs benedict this place is a must for breakfast. Yeh, you should really try the last. If you like chorizo you will surely enjoy the benedict dish. My bf always gets the breakfast nachos which I have to say are pretty darn yummy! The nachos consist of chorizo, egg, tomatoes...and all kinds of good stuff.  Plus for us that they allow dogs on the patio. Most the time it is a bit tight with our 2 dogs on a busy weekend but today (sunday) we arrived at 7 a.m. and had the patio to ourselves.  Service is at a decent pace any faster and I would feel rushed. Any slower and I would give this place 4 stars.  Servers are friendly enough.  We have also been here for lunch which is just as nice with good options. I had a strawberry chicken salad, tasty. Only complaint chicken was on the dry side.   Overall, DD is consistent and that I like. We know we can expect yumminess every time we visit.

This review is for the auto shop.   I have gotten my oil changed at this location for the past 3 years. My wait is usually between 30 minutes to an hour, not bad.   So it is not attached to the best mall in town, but some browsing makes the wait go by faster. Or I can grab a few groceries while I wait and by the time I'm done my car is ready.   They say they will call/page you when your vehicle is ready but I have yet to have this happen. When I drop off my car I ask how long the wait is and come back then, my car is usually done by the time they say and parked outside.   I have no complaints about the service. They do a good job and I appreciate that.

For meatatarians! Wow, bring on the beef. From chicken legs to lamb this place serves you as much meat as you can handle and then some.  Everyone is given a coaster like deal that is red on one side for stop, and green on the other for go! The servers will continue to come to your table as long as the green side is up. I believe I have tried all their cuts of beef, but my fav is the house beef. So tasty and mouthwatering. The salad bar is full of delicious options: salmon, brie, chicken salad....etc. The side dishes are also great: mashed potatoes, this awesome little bread, and plantains.  The desserts are delicious!

I actually give this hotel 4.5 stars.  So it doesn't have a casino or restaurants, that's what Aria & Cosmopolitan are for. It truly feels like coming home. It is smoke free and clean. I love coming back to this hotel!  From arrival to departure I had no issues whatsoever. Best to call valet (like is suggested) and they will have your car waiting for you by the time you get downstairs. Bellhop did take about 20 mins or more but it gave me time to relax and love the view from my room. Not a whole lot of staff around the place, so the staff that is there could be a bit more outgoing so they standout. It is just a laid back, clean hotel.  Would stay here again and again!

Just a heads up, don't go here with the expectation that you're getting authentic Mexican food. All of us Zonies know that a really great authentic Mexican restaurant almost always begins with a Mexican woman's name :)  This place is very good for what it is, it's a modern Mexican joint. I like the fish or carne asada tacos. They have lemonade of all sorts, the sour kind that tastes homemade, and oh-so good if you ask me. The creamy rice is my fav (don't look up the ingredients, it will ruin the fun in eating it). The salsa is so-so.   My bf is not a fan of AZ Mexican food, he is more of a tex-mex kinda guy, and he likes this place -great for me, since it is close by.   The decor is fun and the employees are perky. It is also low-key place that is easy and you can go as you are.

Here this afternoon to try the eggs benedict with spam! That's right SPAM! Oh yeah, it was pretty darn good.  Although my dish was good some minor improvements can be made to make it perfect; toast the muffin more, mine was hardly toasted at all and the hollidase sauce needs a little more pizzaz, it was on the bland side.   Overall, I really like the food here, both brunch and dinner, love the location and atmosphere, great patio, and pretty decent servers.   PS. Dog friendly patio!

So IT IS a wine bar but we go here for the food and cocktails. Honestly, we have yet to order a bottle of wine or even peruse the wine list :l   One of the reasons this place brings us back so often is the oh-so-delicious bruschetta! Just your most common bruschetta: bread, cherry tomato, basil, mozzarella version is so scrumptious! Quality moz and flavor packed toms kick this dish way up with the best of the best.  To go with my meal, I order the Moscow Mule. Boy oh boy do these guys make a kick butt MM! It comes in an authentic copper mug- nice touch.   For the main, I have only had the Chicken Picatta (Pan seared, green beans, egg noodles, lemon-caper butter sauce). I sub the egg noodles for bowtie. Truthfully, the 1st time was the best ever and the other times after haven't reached the yumminess I first encountered. So now I can say I'm ready to try other dishes on the menu.   Until summer hit we were seated on the patio, but lately we've been seated inside. Being dog lovers I really dig the colorful, artistic dog portraits, particularly the Last Supper rendition.  Oh, and as I mentioned in my quick tip: Live music Thurs-Sat. The musicians stick with fun bar type tunes that you will be sure to know.

So I get why this place gets 4.5 stars, the tacos are fabulous!!!!! Yep, 5 exclamation marks good. The tacos are gourmet. I tried the mahi mahi (grilled, I'm not sure if there is a fried version) and the veggie taco. Hmm, they are both equally good; I can't pick one over the other. I can say that the Pecan salsa helped out the fish taco with a nice spiciness and gave it that pizzazz it needed to set it apart.   This is my first visit to La Condesa so, I'm not sure how the place works, but from what I gather you just walk-in and grab a seat then a server will eventually get to you. It was a Sunday evening when we stopped by and there was only 1 SERVER!!! Poor thing was running all over the place. I don't blame her for not getting to us with the first few minutes we sat down. After a little bit she regained her composure and was friendly and accommodating. She really shouldn't of been the only person serving the place was hopping as one group left another entered. There was no one standing around waiting for a place to sit, and honestly I don't know where they would wait.   The paintings on the walls are amazing. Great art work to look at. However, I was seated at the bar and faced empty bar shelves and the light above me was out, so it was very dim. So as far as ambiance, it just wasn't quite working for me.   Back to the food.. The refried beans could use some improvement. Okay, so I am Hispanic and have been eating beans since birth and I have never had beans so watered down. It was more of a cold bean soup. Maybe that's what La Condesa was going for, but that didn't work for me either. The rice was good and warm.    I enjoyed the salsa bar. So many salsas, Cilantro (like), Pico (like), Pecan (like), Peanut, Mexican (like), the list goes on!!  I would visit this place again with the hopes that I get a table next time!

This location happens to be across the street from ASU so you can imagine how extremely busy it is...ALL THE TIME! The parking lot is way to0 small as well as the amount of seating. Given its busy-ness they might want to think about expanding to accommodate those that would like to eat "for here" rather than "to go." I also hate the chairs. Call me picky but the seat bottoms have a weird slant to them. Overall the whole arrangement in this store and actually all the stores isn't very appealing.  That out of the way...I am addicted to the Veggie Bowl: rice, blk beans, pico, corn, cheese, and avocado (ps. avocado is no charge with the veggie option). I love it, I love it.   I haven't had any of the meat choices in quite some time since I discovered the veggie bowl.  This store is consistently good. Thank you!

Wow, this is the neighborhood post office and it is slower than molasses. Seriously, I have been in here a few times and it is ridiculously slow moving. Always expect a line and to waste up to 45 minutes getting through it. I know, I know they are probably doing the best they can but geez!   I'm not very post office savvy so I usually have to bear through the line to make sure I am mailing something correctly.   For those that are hip there is a fabulous kiosk in the lobby that can do just about everything the clerks can do and you can pay with card (maybe even cash, I'm not sure).

So this place is well known by art students, but not all art students (but it should be). It is located in design north on the second floor. It is a coffee/tea/bagel/korma/salad/sandwhich kinda place.   Happy Hour is 3-5pm, half of espresso drinks.  I am in love with the vegetable korma, get it with greek yogurt for extra yuminess.   I like the convenience, especially in the morning when you didn't eat breakfast, just stop by old faithful Charlies and grab yo'self a bagel.  Americano with a splash of soy is my choice for espresso drinks. It is very good, just the right amount of coffee taste with the soy to mellow it out a tad. I like my coffee to taste strong, almost like it punched me to wake me up and this American is the one for me.   It is also a nice place to hang out and kill time before your next class. Plug-ins are limited for you laptop users. THE PATIO IS THE BEST PART, ESPECIALLY DURING COOLER MONTHS YOU CAN SIT OUTSIDE AND ENJOY. (minus the smokers, even though there are no smoking signs it happens and it sucks.)

This is my first semester using the Student Recreation Complex (SRC) after several of semesters attending ASU and paying the fitness fees. So this semester I figured I will get my money's worth.   The first week back to school the SRC offers free fitness classes! What a great idea, it totally got me motivated. The fit classes are $45.00 and the mind/body classes are about $100.00. Although I would like to take both aerobics and yoga workouts, I think I am going to spare a little cash and just do aerobics this semester.   The building and equipment seem pretty up-to-date, there are just some things that show their age, like the woman's locker room and the towels. The woman's locker room is a 3.5 star. It is definitely dated, but kept very clean. The room is unappealing as soon as you walk into this baby blue color that adorns all the tiles on the walls and lockers. Ugh! Showers are open; however there is a section that offers some privacy with easy to see through curtains. The towels are pretty small and thin, but they get the job done. Unlimited towels are available if you buy a locker for $30.00/semester.   Most, if not all, of the cardio machines have individual tv's attached. I think there are two weight rooms (which I have not entered yet, but they seem rather large).   Free fit and mind/body classes had me partaking in: Yoga flow, Zumba Party, and Butts & Guts. The schedule for fit classes is long, up to 14 classes a day, sure to work into your busy life's! The instructors have all been amazing so far. I look forward to trying out the variety of classes they offer.   There is also a smoothie/snack bar.  I'm sure I am leaving out so, so much. Being my first week in this gym I have a lot to discover.

The majority of reviewers don't lie....it really was that bad.  This event spread like wild fire, I had family members and friends talking about this event from the get-go!   Me and my bf arrived around 130 to a stand still at the parking entrance, cars in front of us were u-turning their way out of there, so we did the same and parked in a nearby  field.   Walking up to the event the lines looked ridiculous. Come to find out I would wait over 2.5 hours at the taco truck. Not cool. I waited by myself while family and friends waited in other lines, my sister's kids played corn hole, and some chose not to wait in line at all and grab something on the way home.   The variety of games was the best part. Great FREE activities for all ages to take part in.  So food wise my tacos were good. Even though I arrived on an empty stomach, the tacos weren't overly fantastic or even worth the wait. I got the veggie, chicken, and beef taco. I shared and we all agreed the chicken taco was the winner. Would I wait 2 hours for those tacos again....NOPE! My friends graciously shared their fried bread and funnel cake with the group and that was really good.  Wonderful idea, poor execution. Maybe next time it will be better.

I love that they carry a wide variety of delicious sweetness and that the size of many of these treats are on the mini or small size so you can taste away. I salted caramel cupcake and macaroon are my utmost favs!!!
