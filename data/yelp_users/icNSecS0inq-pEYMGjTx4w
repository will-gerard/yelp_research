My experience last night:  4:56 - called to order my 24" 2 topping pizza w/the promo 18 wings free. The young woman on the phone was rude and curt, but took my order (apparently this is not unusual for this location). I was told my delivery time was 45 minutes (I live 1.6 miles away, so this seemed legit, given the Cards playoff game and all).  6:22 - still no pizza. I call back and am told that "they don't know what is up with the driver, but that my pizza is done and he should be right back to get it/bring it to me." I ask if they have a delivery charge, because, after the pizza being 30+ minutes late as of the phone call, I have zero intention of tipping or paying that (note: I have worked a ton of service jobs and almost always tip and tip well).  6:38 - I get a phone call from "Ashley" who asks me if I can "just come and pick up my pizza" so I can get it hot. I'm totally in shock at this request and am already upset about the Cards game (15-34 at this point). Ashley (the manager on duty) assures me that they will grant me "points" on the app which basically entails a "free big Jimmy 24' one-topping pizza. When I get there, Ashley gives me my food and explains (in a somewhat confusing fashion) how the points work. When I asked quite pointedly, "What happened??" (as it's now 6:55pm), she seems to actually tell the truth, that they are "really busy" and "my ticket got lost back there".  Now, I'm a hard working and forgiving person, but there was a ton of attitude in that place - from the first call, to blaming the driver, to admitting the ticket got lost but not actually apologizing.   I should have checked the pizza in the store (I KNOW), but was tired, starving and frustrated. I checked it in the dark of my car to make sure the correct toppings were there, but did not get good look until I got home.  Please see photos of the minimal toppings on this pizza - the pizza which took me two hours from order to pick-up and was supposed to be a delivery (note: Ashley did give me my $3 delivery fee in cash back). Still, there was no offer to refund my money and clearly no effort to make this pizza amazing. If anything it's like they skimped on toppings intentionally?  I posted my complaint and photos on Facebook, only to have a ton of friends say how "surprised" and "disappointed" they were in this - that "they love J & Js". Well, maybe it's just this location, but once I use my "free" pizza (which I will go in and order and pick up and show them these photos) - I will never get one from here again.   If you are reading this, management, I would really just like a refund. Or, a second shot at the most amazing pizza ever. I work hard and want to support local businesses, but clearly, I should have gone with Papa Johns (who also is not amazing, but consistent in that, at least).

Well, I just spent $40 on a car wash for my gf's Jeep. To be fair, the Jeep was in bad shape (parked under a tree for awhile, need I say more?). However, what I was surprised about was the inadequacy of the front window washing, water marks (not the permanent kind, but the "I'm in a hurry and not drying your car, kind).  They did re-do the windows, which I appreciated. But, when I got home, I noticed they only cleaned back wheel wells and not the two front? Huh? That doesn't make any sense.  I will use the comp car wash that came with it, but won't go back. Pretty sure your $$ is better spent elsewhere.  On a positive note, all the customer service interactions were great - just not the quality of the job for the cost  Meh.

Don't waste your money!!  Went on 10/16 with four friends. This is our "girls night out' Halloween tradition. We have been to several others in the past including, Fear Farm, 13th Floor and, last year, Rob Zombie's Nightmare. All three were better. Comparing Scarizona to these is like comparing the fort you made in your living room to any Frank Lloyd Wright structure - no comparison.  Details: we purchased the "Fast Pass" online to avoid lines (which was a joke, there were maybe 12 people there in total, besides the actors).  *Cost  = $30 each (minus $2 coupon, plus $2 online fee).   *Location - close to the East Valley which is exactly why we chose it - wanted to go somewhere a bit closer this year. Hard to find, dark, though, as the previous reviewer said, they did have parking helpers.  *Atmosphere - non-existent. We thought we were in the wrong place when we showed up. The website promotes a "carnival atmosphere" - there was NOTHING there. To be fair, it had rained hard that night, but they should have closed.   Instead, there was - no live music, no chainsaw gauntlet running, no other amusements whatsoever. The Beer/Wine place was open and yes, we needed that $5 Bud Light to drown our wasted money sorrows.  *The "Haunted Houses"  - were a joke. The "blackout one" was actually lighter than the other one. No special effects besides blinking lights (if you've been to the other decent ones in town, you'll know what cool effects are possible).  MOST IMPORTANTLY - BE CAREFUL...the floors are uneven and there are STEPS!!! Which are NOT marked. One of my friends totally tripped, banged up her knees and hands. I fell on top of her and cut my knee and bruised it (this is where you step "up" to a metal floor/bridge. Seriously - who makes steps in a dark place with no notice. This is a liability and they are really lucky we were not really injured (and that we have more important things to do than sue them).  **Before we entered the second house, I spoke with a worker and one of the owners, Tracy, who apologized for the lack of entertainment (due to the "rain"), but who offered to have us back "VIP Style". While I appreciated her efforts, by the time we fell and got hurt in the second house, we wanted nothing to do with this place/people. Prior to the fall, I had asked Tracy if we could get our "fast pass" money back ($10), at minimum, as the park was clearly not making good on their promotions on line (music, food vendors, entertainment, etc). Tracey's response was "no, we are a corporation, you know." Thus, the "VIP" offer.   Sorry, given that the HHs are crummy and completely sub-par quality (for the cost, especially) and that you had the park open with no extra features - we would not waste our time.  And please, don't waste yours. We really wanted to support a new business, especially one located in the East Valley where we live, but the level of incompetence and irresponsibility with Scarizona is frightening...and that is about all that was!  **Refund our money, Scarizona...or at minimum, make sure you don't have uneven floors and "steps" where people can get hurt.
