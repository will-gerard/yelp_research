This is by far the Best Starbucks I have ever been too. They have the best customer service I have ever had. They go above and beyond their jobs. I always feel very welcomed at this location. The Staff is extremely friendly and inviting. This is a Starbucks where your not just order a but a person. I would Highly Recommend this Starbucks to everyone.

The Coffee here is extremely good. Their best drink is the white carbo and I would highly recommend it. Their cold brew coffee is also really good. The owner is really friendly and easy to talk too.  The owner is also really knowledge about his product and well informed about coffee. This is a must try coffee shop.

I'll Start with this is one best coffee shops in the west valley, and they have a really good beer selection. They had have a really good beer selection. One of the best beer selections for a local place. But what kills this place has no customer service. It is awful. You can go behind the counter and make your coffee. It took them 19 minutes to make my chia tea and I was the only one in line. I would avoid this place unless you want to go put your own.

This place is a hidden gem, I highly recommend this place to anyone who likes a true mom and pop coffee shop, it is very relaxing and cozy. it is worth the drive and it taste way better than starbucks.  I recommend their Iced Chai with Irish Cream. Grab a cup of coffee and just walk around downtown glendale is a perfect date.

The food is Really good!!! One of my favorite restaurants. I took my mom and sister here as treat and they absolutely loved it.  The food is really good blackened and their sweet tea is straight from the south. I would recommend this places. The only down fall is it is pretty pricey.

This is the worse place I have ever been, the service was terrible. The server did not look like she cared about her job.  The wings were beyond gross, McDonald's has better wings than them. The wings were so bad that they got me super sick and I was throwing up all night. I would never go back or recommend to go there.

They have amazing donuts, the chocolate old fashion donut is really good. I recommend it. Also the staff here are friendly. Always make you feel valued as customer. I would recommend going here and supporting a local business as well. They are worth it.

This Gamestop is the only one I go to, the staff is very welcoming. They give you game suggestions that fit you. They staff always goes above and beyond their job. They greet you every time you walk and ask how they can. They also make sure you get the best copy possible for a used game.

Very Good Craft beer, it's nice that Goodyear has a brewery that it's locals can go too. This brewery and 4 peaks brewery are really good. Good Check them out!!! It's must go to stop. The food is ok but the beer is what is on point here.

The Drinks are good the service is so slow, it takes about 25 minutes to get your drink. The price always varies I order the same thing and it's always a different price. The customer service is lacking.
