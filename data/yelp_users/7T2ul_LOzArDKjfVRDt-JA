If you're reading this and thinking that the drive is too far. It isn't. Go.  I first saw Dr. Shure in early 2004 when my 16 year old Pomeranian was diagnosed with lymphoma. Dr. Shure made me feel comfortable about my decision to give him palliative care and reassured me that when the time was right, I would know. He was right and I did.  When my Keeshond Joey was showing no signs of Valley Fever except tenderness and irritability, he tested him anyway and he was right. Immediately after treatment he started responding. His titer was so high we weren't sure he was going to pull through. Dr. Shure prescribed the right amount of medication at the right time and saved his life. Today, he's doing great - still on his medication but acts like a puppy.  A week ago Tuesday we thought Pauly, our 18.5 year old cat had a stroke.He appeared to have gone completely blind in an instant. He was unstable and would walk right into walls. My husband took him in to see Dr. Shure knowing we would have to put him down. We said our goodbyes and he was on his way. Dr. Shure reassured him that the problems he was having were not neurological and that we could run a few tests to determine what was going on. He didn't feel that Pauly was critical and for his age, thought he was in great shape. Turns out he has high blood pressure and some kidney issues. My husband brought him home, we started his medications, a kidney friendly diet and subcutaneous fluids. Pauly is better than ever. I mean...REALLY so much better!   I can't help but refer to him affectionately as "deadkitty" or "zombiekitty", it's cute and he likes it! I think it makes him feel like a badass.  Dr. Shure was not about to recommend some heroic life saving surgery. He knows Pauly is old but he also knew that with a change in his diet and a little extra care we could get some quality time with him.  I have sent several of my clients to see Dr. Schure because they were having horrible experiences with their veterinarians. ALL have been extremely satisfied and credit Dr. Shure for saving their pets lives. One of them, numerous times.  Dr. Shure is caring and practical. He has common sense when it comes to treating your loved ones. You will be more than happy with him, I'm sure of it.

We took Pauly back to Dr. Schure about two weeks ago. He didn't order a crazy amount of blood work. He could tell by looking at him that he was doing rather well. He decided to keep him on his medication and his diet and play it by ear. I'm so grateful.  Pauly aka ZombieKitty is doing so great. His quality of life had improved exponentially and we have Dr. Schure to thank for making Pauly's 20th year one of his best.

So we have Violet. She was truly a puppy stray that we picked up in Claypool, Az.  With Mange. Nice, huh? Dr. Shure is so good with her..she loves him and let him pull...are you listening? PULL A TOOTH with no sedation. He knew it was wonky and would come out easily and he didn't even freakin' charge us for it. WHO does that?  GO. Go. I send all my clients there and they're all satisfied.

Damn you Los Favoritos!   Ever since my Saturday bean burrito I haven't "been right". IIIf you know what I mean..annnd I.think.that.you.do.   Even if there was a negative star rating, I would still give them one star. For the weight loss.  I should have learned my lesson with the chicken 3 years ago.

This is a good place for a quick meal. We've eaten breakfast here a few times. The food is always decent, the service always prompt.  Here's the thing - I always feel RUSHED, totally rushed.  I'm not the type of person that nurses a drink,  takes up a table for hours or sips coffee all morning. I don't even read the paper while I'm there, although I might like to if I didn't feel so rushed.  This morning I noticed a sign that says "During our busy times, please do not conduct your business meetings, studying.." I can't remember the rest but I found it offensive.  I can understand that they don't want people taking up a table when paying customers are waiting. I totally get that.  However, the place is huge and I've never waited for a table.   Perhaps if the wording was different. If people are hanging out, aren't they spending money? Even if they're drinking coffee?  Maybe the patio could be self service so waiters don't have to miss out on customers.   It totally rubbed me the wrong way and it's plastered as soon as you walk in the door. It's like saying "Don't enjoy your time here, get in and get out!" In this economy you think they'd be happy to have any business.

Five stars no doubt, for Brian the store manager. I know you can't seek him out for everything because I'm sure he's busy. Last night my husband had to have a water heater replaced...GE agreed to replace it but had us take it to home depot and then have home depot call GE. I thought it would be a nightmare and they would look at him like he was a nut. Brian got right on it. Had someone from the Customer Service desk call while he searched for the water heater (which was hiding btw, he found it though!) My husband doesn't go in to details about his experience at stores...he's just not that interested but he raved about Brian.  Brian helped us once before in the lawn and garden dept. He was honest about the product and offered something more effective. He must have taken some crazy advanced Customer Service class or he is.not.from.this.planet. Seriously, he rocks.  There's a woman that works in plumbing too..I don't know her name. I think she said her family owned a plumbing business at one time. She knows her shit.   If it not for these two, I wouldn't even rate that store because my mother always said "if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all".

I have to agree with Alexander- when you walk in to the Tally Ho it's like a time warp - in a warm fuzzy kind of way. My grandparents owned an old tavern and I loved the way it smelled - I think this is one of the reasons I love the Tally Ho.   From the outside it looks as though the place is going to be dark and seedy. It's not at all. It's bright and clean. The service is great and the drinks are cheap.  It's a great place to have a few beers after being at the pool all day or stop in for a night cap. Totally the Regal Beagle of Scottsdale.

The first thing I noticed about this place was that it was open and super tidy. There weren't magazines strewn about.  Even on a Monday morning there weren't  a bunch of people waiting in the waiting room. People checked in and moved right through.   It's great that you get your own dressing room that locks. No shoving your clothes and belongings in a cramped little locker. The staff gives you a pair of scrubs to wear for your procedure. No traipsing around in a half open gown and ankle boots. (I'd like to forget that SMLE experience)  My technician (bob) was friendly and nice without being goofy. Explained everything that was happening. I was having a simple CT scan with contrast dye. I was in and out in about 45 minutes.   BTW, I LIKE the contrast dye. Sick isn't it? A whole body warm fuzzy. I just wish it lasted longer.

Getting to this location is an effin' nightmare right now. It's especially irritating if they forget part of your order and you have to go back - not going to happen.  Occasionally we'll get food to go here..nearly every time they forget some part of our order.  We peek in the bag look to make sure most of it is there but don't open each and every carton to inspect (big mistake).  The salmon comes with some sort of sauce that at least makes it edible. No  sauce. I called. "oh yeah, the salmon doesn't come with sauce anymore"  How am I supposed to know that? How is anyone supposed to know that?!  Should we just start asking about every menu item? Does the pasta come with sauce? Well, actually...it does...but not nearly as much as it used to.   It's TO GO. NO napkins, No plasticware.  The no rules pasta with chicken was dry. The chicken - A grilled breast tossed on the top of the pasta. Not cut into strips or cubes.  I've always been disappointed with the level of service and quality of food. It used to be convenient so I would suck it up and do curbside. No more. Never again.

I've used the printing company in downtown scottsdale many times. I've been absolutely thrilled with every order. The staff is helpful, knowledgable and friendly. Your projects get personalized attention unlike other larger printing companies. Joe and his staff offer great marketing ideas and can walk you through from start to finish. They're easy to find. Just south of Indian School on Miller Rd in the Regal Rags shopping center. (Across from OLPH).

I have no idea even where to start this review. Scott, on a weekend, sent a tow truck to my husband.He fixed our truck for a ridiculously low amount....and fast.  He once told me how to fix my car over the phone and it worked!No charge.  And recently he saved my ass when I was financially and emotionally strapped. He is THE MOST HONEST GUY in the business and I have sent countless clients and family members to him. They have all had the same experience. If you don't try Whiteys you are denying yourself the gift of Scott and his crew. You never have to question what he says is true..it is. I'm so grateful for his service, his friendship, his honesty and generosity.  Words really escape me when I think of how fortunate I am  to have found him and his shop.

Love it! From the jalapeno ranch salad dressing to the habanaro burger (FIRE). We often go on the weekends after 11 and take advantage of the happy hour sliders. They're awesome- don't forget to ask for the chipolte mayo for the fries.  Great Margaritas- fresh squeezed lime juice- just the right amount of salt- or not.  They have a great patio with live music occassionally, misters and a moat.  Two of our favorite bartenders are gone, Christy and Scotty but hopefully we still have Matt!  A lot of people in the industry eat here so you know it has to be good.

I could have reviewed this place one million more times. Two things that stand out recently.  As many times as I've been there I've never had their green chili mac & cheese - Where was I? Lalala land? It's fabulous. I.want.to.go.to.there. -again.  Late one night we were talking about how convenient it would be to have 'donuts to go' for us late night drinkers. That way we wouldn't have to stop on the way home OR get up with a hang over and run out to get donuts/breakfast burritos/pepto that sort of thing the next morning. Just drunken bar converstation with the bartenders.  Well, not half an hour later one of the bartenders showed up with a dozen donuts. SERIOUSLY! I was impressed and thrilled and covered in chocolate frosting by the time we left. :)  Seriously good times. Fabulous staff and customer service. Doesn't get any better than this.. I can't think of any more to say. Go there, just don't take my seat.

My husband and I went to Carlsbad last night. It really is one of our favorite places. We typically sit at the bar..alright, who am I kidding? We always sit at the bar.  Why? Because the service it outstanding. Matt & Jacob were working last night- we always have such a great time with them. The conversation, the drinks, the food. It's like our home away from home.   My husband had the Surf & Turf and I had a bite of the filet and the shrimp and both were supremely delicious! The filet was cooked to perfection and smothered in shitake mushrooms. To. Die. For.  He ate everything on his plate. I thought he was going to lick it clean.  (Thankfully, he knows better).  I'm dieting. I had a salad with no dressing and ate the whole thing. Really. A salad with no dressing and I still ate it all! Plus they didn't roll their eyes when I brought in my diet tonic. And believe me, I deserved at least an eye roll.  This is what I really wanted to share with you. During the month of September they have 1/2 priced food items from their late night menu. 12AM - 2AM Sunday through Thurs HALF PRICE! The sliders were already a screaming delicious deal and now they're half off.   There is a God and he loves me! Loves me to eat  Half price Sliders. AMIRITE?!

meh.   I had to shlep over to the new post office just north of McDowell and had read good reviews about this place so I thought I would give a try.  Used the drive-thru so I can't comment on the cleanliness. Nice tip jar hanging on the drive thru window *eyeroll*. I honestly don't have a problem with tipping. However, do we tip at taco bell? No. Or do we? Yet? Urg.  The bean and cheese burrito was runny and salty. Their hot sauce was watery and not even close to hot - probably because it was mostly water. I also got their beef taco. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach. One bite and it was actually decent, but I was done, full. I wish I would have eaten the taco first and skipped the bean burrito. We all know you can't save a taco. It becomes a mushy mess - no ones fault but the nature of the taco.  Los Favoritos has them beat by FAR. If you're a fan of Fiesta Burrito, make the drive to LF and give it a try.  Btw, that new Post Office - clusterfuck.

"morrrrre liquor?" My husband teases me by saying that when he wants to go to Los Sombreros. We've been going to Los for at least 4 years. We love the food and we love Steve, the Scottish Bartender. In fact, if we drive through and the place is packed, we'll go have a cocktail somewhere else and then come back...and wait until a seat at the bar opens up. He makes a kick a** patron margarita and knows more about tequila than a person should.:) The seafood crepes are my favorite, my husband gets the enchiladas with mole sauce. I love topping the night off with one of steves - I'm totally going to blow it here- roma pope-  It's in a blue glass with melted ice cream and an orange slice and of course- tequila..  Even if it's sweltering hot- go. The patron margaritas make up for it.

Four of us went last night and we were lucky enough to get seats at the bar. Yay!  We had Steve's patron margaritas, the tower of guacamole and the carne asada tacos with pico de gallo- to start. It was all delicious- Another round of margaritas and I had the seafood crepes. I don't know what anyone else had because I was in a food coma. (and on my second margarita)  I usually order the seafood crepes but they were particularly delicious last night.  We had dessert- something steve recommended and it was divine. I can't remember what it was..it was after my second margarita- it was a cake thing...or other. Ohhhkay. Topped it all off with a Rome Popay or at least that's how it's pronounced. I love it. I could bathe in it!  Don't miss out on their REVERSE HAPPY HOUR from 9-11 with $5.00 menu items and drinks. Plus all the douchebags are gone by then and you might get a seat at the bar. Geoff and Steve are both so friendly and personable. I could go on and on just about those two. GO! btw- I wasn't driving.

Remember when I said "don't miss the reverse happy hour"?  Did you go? Ya gotta go! They're even open on Sundays and Mondays but the happy hour doesn't apply to those two days.  Looky- Here's the list of their  $5.00  Happy Hour Menu Tuesday - Saturday from 9-10 Friday & Saturday from 9-11   Only at the bar or the bar tables but the service is fast because Geoff & Steve kick ass.  Drinks  * Margarita with Chinaco Blanco on the rocks or frozen * Cuba Libre with Bacardi & Coke topped with lime * Mojito  * Sangria red or white * Montes Chardonnay glass * Gnarly Head red zinfandel glass * Shot of Tequila Blanco served with sangrita (that sangrita kicks ass!). Your choice of Tequila: Don Julio, Tesoro, Herradura, Tezon, Centenario, Chinaco, Milagro, Oro Azul, Tres Generaciones, Cazadores, Partida or Certeza. ** $2.00 XX Draft Beer  Food  * Guacamole, chips & salsa  * Black bean queso fundidio served with chips * 2red beef tamalitos * 2 quesadillas de rajas (mexico city style) * Shrimp cocktail with chunks of mango (To die for!) * Field greens chicken salad with lime vinaigrette * Watermelon & panela cheese salad * Jicama & orange salad with chile-lime dressing * 2 tacos dorados de pollo (plaza style) * 3 carnitas tacos with pico de gallo and homemade tortillas  Can you believe I memorized all of that? I'm like Rain Man.  Okay I lied. I stole the menu! Ha.

This is a wonderful dog park.  I appreciate the way they rotate the active dog area so it doesn't totally kill the grass. The shade structures are beautiful and of course - shady.  I love the surrounding landscape and architecture.  We've met some really cool people. Your dog sniffing another dogs butt is a huge icebreaker. Who would have thought.  One problem.  PICK UP YOUR DOG POOP! I'm not even kidding about this. I see the dog poop. I see the owner see  their dog poop. No pick up. No follow through at all!  I swear to GOD and baby jesus I'm going to put the poop in the blue bag and then tie it to the dogs collar.   I understand that people get busy talking or perhaps their dog sneaks off to poop. I'm not a poop nazi. I'm willing to pick up poop that is not my own. I don't stand around and bitch about all the poop without grabbing a few bags and picking up random poops. PAY IT FORWARD PEOPLE!   It would be nice if they had hand purell hand sanitizer dispensers. Couldn't the Dial Corporation donate some sanitizer thingies?  I might be taking it too far but I picked up a lot of stranger poop today, cut me some slack.  Oh and if you bring your kids with their kiddie snacks - that should count as child abuse. Why don't you just tie porkchops around their necks and turn 'em loose?

I had no idea this place was here until I read about it on Yelp. I think it's usually dark when I'm down there and I'm focused on getting into Los.  I knew I was getting a Dirty Chai Latte. Pulled up to one window...should I stay? Go? pull forward? The pressure!  Pulled forward and was greeted by a rather homely looking young guy..ha! Right? Homely!  His shirt said "wanted" and he wasn't kidding.  How could he know what was in my head?  Seriously beautiful. I even called my husband to tell him how beautiful this boy was. He's young. I don't know that he's a boy..I'm just sayin'.   I almost didn't want to order my Dirty Chai Latte because I had to say "dirty" and I was afraid it would purrrrrr out of me like a cougar.  I managed to order without purring. It was delicious and I was on my way. Life is good.

We went to the fair on opening day. A buck to get in but 12.00 to park.  We took my nine year old neice who had never been to a fair (she lives in Globe and they keep her fairly sheltered). She was overwhelmed just walking in and I caught her staring at quite a few people.  She probably would have been happy to leave right then having seen enough freaky people.  The food was good. Fair food. Greasy and sugary and cotton candy wonderfuliciousness. That's a word. Don't question me.  We rode a few rides. Had a great time. We decided to leave just three hours later when we spotted two 12 or 13 yr old girls makin' out. Yeah, thankfully she didn't see THAT. It would have been a long ride home full of questions...that only her mother should answer.   On the way out we stepped over a hypodermic needle. I like how the addicts just leave it there for the next guy. I like a giving spirit.

Recently I stopped here to grab a salad for lunch. I had the chicken caesar salad and it was so good that I almost called to tell them. The salad was cold, the chicken was warm, thinly grated parmesan cheese. Delicious! It was so large that I had it for two meals.  The staff is super friendly. The restaurant was very clean and open.  You can tell these guys are trying really hard to make this a great restaurant. They're in an iffy, alright - it's not iffy - it's a crappy plaza that was supposed to be remodeled over a year ago but their little corner looks great.  Great iced tea and free wifi!  I'll have to try the lemonade next time.  The lemonade is fabulous and it looks like a great place to watch a football game with the indoor area and outdoor patio.

I see a lot of four stars...perhaps I'm too generous with my five stars. I'm a giver.  Attended a party for Georgie on Friday night and had a great time.  Easy to find, easy to park, easy to get a drink.   Plus- HEY they have the same turbo nozzle a/c vents that I have in my home. I could live there. Exposed brick? Me too! Felt right at home. I love the way they display their art, I'm assuming from local artists.   I would prefer to not have to walk down a flight of stairs after a night of drinking. However, no problems there - thankfully. :)

I might live here this summer. Definitely a place you can grab a beer after spending the day poolside.  I loved seeing some of the old school Scottsdale guys here having a beer on a Saturday.   Next time - up top! Hopefully I can maneuver the stairs after a beverage or two....  Thanks to Julia T for introducing us to a great new (to us) spot!

My move was yesterday. I wish I had written down the names of the 2 guys that came to move me. They were so nice.  My dog was barking and completely stressing me out but they were friendly to her and completely understood.  They got me loaded and unloaded in 3 hours!  3 hours!  Now, I was fairly prepared but I noticed at one point they were sprinting from the truck to the house.  Honest, efficient, on time & courteous. What more can you ask for in a business? I hope I don't have to move anytime soon but I will certainly be recommending them to my clients and friends.

My skin feels delicious.  ~---that could be my whole review if you knew how I previously felt about my skin - since you don't - some background.  I've never been comfortable with my skin, living in Az my whole life has left me with an uneven tone. My genes have given me over sized pores and The Devil has recently started giving me oily but flaky skin.   I've started seeing Kerry for regular facials and she recommended a skin care routine. Recommended NOT pushed. I was concerned about being talked into buying a bunch of useless products that I would never use. She's not like that at all. She doesn't want you buying them if you're not going to use them. HUH? Wha??? Yes- she genuinely cares about her clients and it shows in the way she treats each client as an individual. (Plus, she can barely keep The Max in stock, so don't buy it if you're not going to use it!)  My skin has been transformed into glowing healthy skin. The skin care routine is quick and easy,  I only wish I'd started it 10 years ago.   I've actually gone out twice this week without liquid foundation *gasp* and no children were harmed. :)

Jen has been my stylist for the past 3 years. She really takes the time to listen to what I want..what is working for me and what I'd like to change. Her cuts are precision... you know how after a few weeks your cut can feel grown out and wonky? I've never felt that way. She really cares about your lifestyle and the time you want to spend styling your own hair. She's easily reached via text, which I love! If you're looking for a new stylist, give her a call...

Moved into a new place last month. When I picked up the keys Sunday night it was ewww icky. The landlord and I agreed to split the cleaning fee because I wanted it really clean. In a rush? Finding someone in a Sunday night for Monday morning? What? Impossible! Nope. I was able to book online, they confirmed and we're here on time. We had a mother daughter team from Russia and they were funny and friendly and cleaned like...well, like I can only do on speed. Truth!  So instead of rehab, I left it to the professionals.

Tim & Ben from Valley Goldmine have done two gold parties for me at the salon. One in the fall of last year and one the year before. Both times we had an absolute blast.  I'm not great in large crowds and each time they were the perfect hosts. They managed to get everyone processed and paid in an orderly fashion. All of the guests were thrilled with the money they made on their gold. Thrilled! Me too!  Some of the guests had stones that needed to be removed from settings. Often times it can't be done on site so Tim & Ben take the items, remove the stones and send them back to the clients. Never a single hitch. Everyone got their stones back in a timely manner, safe and sound.   These guys work their butts off, they're on time - come prepared and are so down to earth.  The first time they came out I was half expecting some smarmy "WE BUY GOLD!" guys. Not so..very cool and personable.  A few of my clients have even gone directly to their offices for private appointments. Everyone I've sent has been more than satisfied.  Bonus- They did a party for Christina P. who attended my last party. Because she was a guest of my party, they sent me a check - - totally unexpected. I didn't even know they did that.  I wouldn't even consider using anyone else!

I called Sarah inquiring about repairing the battery port on my Samsung GS5. She was completely honest with me and warned me that it's possible that the screen would crack. She would need to have one on hand in case that happened. I decided to have the screen replaced anyway, what I thought was a scratch was actually a giant crack.  That worked out well! She gave me am amazing deal because I was replacing both parts. She called me when the part was in, even gave me an after hours number to reach her.  I dropped it off, had my phone back in less than an hour.  A week later I thought I was having problems with my microphone,  turns out it was my face. Yeah, little embarrassing.  She was so kind, so nice and patient.  She can have an office full of people and is very patient and generous with her time but completely efficient.  So happy to have found her!  Oh! She also told me how to charge my battery without it being in my phone. She really does care!

My niece has an iPhone 6plus. Cracked screen with a ridiculous deductible.  I knew exactly who to call. Didn't even check out other repair places. Sarah's customer service and skills are all I'll ever need for all my phones! She's extremely honest, fast, reasonable. Check her out, you won't be disappointed!  Thank you, Sarah for the extra goodie!

The sushi was great. I had two 16 year olds that are big eaters so naturally I was concerned. This is gonna be pricey, it wasnt!  We ordered a lot of rolls, admittedly..everything was delicious. Atmosphere not so much but it was Easter...so...  It's great for when you need your sushi fix at a reasonable price.

I used moveaholics a few weeks ago. They were on time, reasonable and had me loaded, moved and  unloaded in 2 hours! Granted,  I was ready.. ohhhhh was I ready! I was waiting in the garage all boxed up and ready to go. Running shoes ON. Not one single thing was damaged or missing or stinky or dirty or weird. Seriously can any of those things happen during a move? Well, yes. But not with Moveaholics!

I wish I could give this place more than five stars. The sushi was amazing. We had the blue find tuna sushi with fresh wasabi...it wasn't in a paste form. So good! I've never had tuna that actually felt like it was melting in your mouth. Sounds weird, right? But really..just like that. We ordered a variety of sushi & rolls. Everything was wonderful. So fresh.  The chef explained where they sourced different types of fish & why. Very informative. Service was great. I loved it when it was Dozo too. So happy to have this in the neighborhood!
