Came here for lunch to mix up the usual subway/corner cafe I usually go to throughout the work week.  To start, I must say their chips were absolutely amazing! What a pleasant departure from the normal tortilla chips that are served at every other Mexican place. The complimentary basket includes several different kinds of chips with a salty seasoning that is out of this world! It reminded me a bit of Steak n Shake seasoning or Lowrys - delicious! I also enjoyed the salsa, tasted very fresh and made in-house.  I went with the blue cheese and steak quesadilla per the servers suggestion (I couldn't decid between the enchiladas and quesadillas). It was pretty yummy and about what I expected. Paired with the dips that it came with (some sort of cilantro/avocado spread and a smokey chipotle) it was gobbled up in no time!  My only drawback is the lack of lunch pricing. I'd love to come back but ~$17 for a quesadilla and soda at lunchtime? I can't be doing that super often.   Will return again in another couple weeks to explore more of the menu!

Shared the brisket sandwich and rib combo with my fiance this evening. One side is included and then we added on another (mac n' cheese and coleslaw).  Portions are HUGE! Great bang for the buck. The ribs were juicy and sauce-y, brisket sandwich was flavorful and had awesome smokey notes to it.The coleslaw is similar to that of KFC's which in my book, is AH-MAZING. Standard back mac n' cheese, not too runny.  You'd never come here for ambience but the place is clean and there are a few TV's around.   My fiance has had lots and lots of BBQ and gave this place his stamp of approval, so we will definitely be returning!

Our new fave hang out spot in PHX!  We came here TWICE this past weekend after finding such a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere with great food and friendly service in Arcadia.  Keegan's is nothing special.. you'd never take a first date here to woo them or come here for a fancy schmancy dinner, but that is perhaps what makes it so charming.   We sat at the bar on both occasions and realized very quick that the bar is a straight up mecca for regulars. Folks would walk in, grab a seat, and the bartender would know them by name and often, what meal they'd be ordering.   We struck up conversation with an older couple the first night only to find them there again the next night! If that doesn't attest to the place being a "regular" spot, then I don't know what does. We were the youngest in the restaurant by about a solid 30 years..however, we're an old retired couple at heart, so we fit right in.  Food: I've only had their wings and potato skins. Both were pretty dang good bar food, but my nod goes to the potato skins. They're super crispy (without being overdone) and I love the cheesy, bacon-y topping. I've also tried their carrot cake - the cream cheese frosting is pretty off the chain (I think thats what the kids say these days) :)  Service: Amazing! Kyle (bartender on Sundays) seemed to know what I needed before I could ask. Our wings came out with Ranch, he quickly caught the error and replaced with blue cheese. I suddenly realized we were missing Salt and Pepper..next thing i knew it appeared in front of us. He also didn't let a drink go empty the entire time we were there all while serving tons of other folks...good eye!   We can't wait to come here again soon, very soon!

This is the third occasion I have been here, and it never disappoints!  To start, I love the setting. Food aside, the architecture of this place is pretty remarkable in and of itself. It had a Frank Lloyd Wright/new age feel, very classy and swanky!  Service has always been attentive and quick.   On our most recent visit, my fiance went with the New York Strip paired with a baked potato while I went with the seared Ahi tuna and avocado & cilantro salad. I had bites of each and everything from the steak to the tuna to the baked potato was outstanding. The steak had a sweet and savory seasoned sear, the tuna was refreshingly good, and baked potato was filled with chives and grated cheese. The one drawback was the amount of salt on the skin of the potato. Coming from a salt-lover, I will say, it was a bit much and could certainly be a turn-off for those who dislike salty foods.    Come here for a special occasion, romantic date, or just because. Regardless of the reason, I've consistently found this place to be spot-on.

Some nights you workout and eat at Flower Child for dinner, other nights you want beer and wings and to kick it back in divey a bar. For those latter nights, this is your spot.   I had read about this spot awhile back and after a coworker mentioned JTs recently, I decided to needed to definitely check this place out!   I love that this place is a "divey" bar but also a spot where you would never run into any questionable characters. It is situated on the border of Scottsdale and Arcadia and is a hidden gem in an otherwise more upscale area.   It's definitely quite intimate inside.. Imagine a typical McDonalds and split it in half, that would be about the size of JTs. There are lots of regulars, I'm positive the owner who seated us knew that it was our first time. We came at the peak of the dinner rush and witnessed a few take out orders, you can tell they have quite the reputation in the area.   My fiancé and I absolutely loved the food. We ordered mild wings, French fries to share, and then I went with a grilled cheese and he got a grilled chicken sandwich.   The wings are SO YUMMY! Because they're grilled after being fried and sauced, there's this wonderful crispiness to the wings, not to mention the added char from the grill that makes for some excellent flavors.   The only drawback was the amount of time we waited for our food which was probably about 45-60 minutes. The waiter apologized and let us know that a ton of take out orders were put in right before we arrived but it does make me leery about going back during dinner and receiving a timely meal. Regardless we will return but maybe at a less peak time, I'm already craving some of those amazing wings!

I found this place as I was parking to go to Flower Child on St. Patty's Day (as you may guess, my St. Patty's Day wasn't very exciting). I feel like I've thoroughly searched through the Arcadia area on Yelp, so I was surprised to find that the place had character and looked super inviting from the outside but yet it'd never come up in any of my searches.   As soon as I got home, I pulled up Wally's on Yelp and made a note to go there ASAP.  Wow! What a hidden gem within "trendy" Arcadia. The inside is quaint, casual, and inviting and outside there's seating on their patio that is adorned with bistro lights.   The staff was very friendly, and the food was excellent! We came in on the tail end of happy hour on a Sunday afternoon. I've attached the HH menu, but overall, some great deals on apps and beer. We went with wings and beer to start (excellent btw), and for dinner, I went with the reuben and my fiance went with the fish and chips (see pics). My reuben was okay but did not come out the traditional sandwich that I was craving..It was filled with ginormous pieces of brisket and was on something that resembled a po' boy bun..not Rye. Somewhat of a let down but not all was lost - I loved the shoestring fries as a side. My fiance loved the fish and chips - no complaints there!  Overall, I really loved this spot and can't wait to try it out again. Arcadia lacks this sort of casual bar/restaurant and though my fiance and I were probably the youngest in there (we sat next to a party of 8 who were 60+), the atmosphere and comfort food menu (i want to try out more items) will definitely bring us back in.

Fun atmosphere that makes you feel like you're stepping back in time. Lots of bits and pieces of 50's Americana on the walls and mini jukeboxes on each table.    Great menu with a variety of greasy comfort foods that are reasonably priced. I ordered the philly cheese steak and my fiance ordered the meatloaf.. his portions were HUGE and he ended up getting a to-go box which is saying something! My sandwich and fries were a bit more moderately sized. We both enjoyed our dishes - very yummy!   Quick service, decent food.. quality is about what you'd expect for a diner.   We would gladly return next time we're in the mood for some yummy good ol' American comfort food! Keep up the good work!

My second time at this location and another 5 star experience!  Both times I've come here with my uncle (who knows the owner, so maybe my experiences here are bit bias ) and we've been treated superb.. Never an empty water or wine glass, fresh warm bread right away, informative and detailed recommendations from the waiter, and last but not least .. Amazing Italian food!  I've ordered the salmon and risotto dish twice because it's simple and so fulfilling! Smokey and moist salmon paired with melt in your mouth risotto, topped with two pieces of grilled asparagus.   It is a bit hidden within a shopping plaza, but the inside is nice, dimly lit, and has a wealth of character.   Excited to (and needing to) try out some different dishes next time we're in the area. Would also be curious to see if we would have similar treatment without my uncle.

Not quite Teepee but nonetheless, a great Mexican joint.   We came here after a volunteer event with my work and had a larger group. We were seated within 5 minutes and drink orders taken immediately. We also had individual salsa cups and chips (a little dry) for the whole table fairly quickly as well which I appreciated as most of us were hungry.   With what the chips lacked, the salsa more than made up for. I swear, I could've drank it. It was SPOT ON.   The service was great. No one (to my knowledge) had empty drinks and our food came out pretty fast considering we had a large group. I ordered the cheese enchilada and it was delicious - though not comparable to the cheese enchiladas at Teepee. My only con was that I wish I ordered two instead of one!  Would go back if I was in the area. Would like to try some of their margs in the future!

This place is  exactly what I imagine a date night would be like in 1945!   My fiance and I decided to indulge in our sweet tooths (teeth?) one gorgeous Scottsdale evening and wandered into Sugar Bowl.  Holy slice of Americana! This place has been around forever (as evident by the worn booths and chairs). We each indulged in a scoop of ice cream while enjoying each other's company and the pink retro decor.   Fun fact: There's lots of Family Circus references throughout the place..the author often used Sugar Bowl as the premier ice cream spot in the comic - who knew?!  I'd love to return next time to try the egg salad sandwich.. oh and of course something sweet!  ;-)

Pretty middle of road Italian spot.  The food is overpriced for what you get - I assume because it is in such a prime Old Town location.   We sat in the back near the entrance to the kitchen. The ambience was..eclectic..to put it nicely. I feel like the paintings and oddly silver finished walls just didn't fit together. It didn't help that the place was dark, dingy, and a bit dirty (especially in the hallway near the kitchen and in the bathrooms). Some touristy food locations upsell you for the ambience .. we quickly learned this wasn't one of those places.  The food wasn't terrible. I went with baked cheese-stuffed ravioli. The sauce was great and the portions were good. I have to note that my starter salad was put together pretty oddly. They basically just dumped a huge dollop of blue cheese on top of a few pieces of lettuce and called it a day. A little bit of a rip of and just lazy service in my opinion.  Server was a bit pushy, but I wouldn't say rude. Overall, timely service and he didn't mess up anything. He actually ran out of the restaurant and chased us down the street because I forgot to sign the receipt - oops!  Our bill came out to close to $70..for 2 glasses of house wine, garlic bread, and 2 of some of the cheapest pasta dishes on the menu!  Sadly, after our mediocre experience and after reading  tons and tons of the other negative reviews, I do not think we'll be back.

What an absolutely AWESOME experience!  First of all, I love that the ticket sales go almost entirely to the care of the animals..for the entire sanctuary there are only 6 paid employees which is a pretty low overhead. The rest of the help is strictly from volunteers.   Our tour guide (whom I did not catch her name) was very knowledgable about the animals and led the tour with a ton of enthusiasm. The group (which involved young children) was very engaged throughout the 1 hr 45 min tour and I credit that to her charisma and passion.  What's great about this place is that the tours are limited to 20 people or less, so you're guaranteed to get pretty close to the animals..a lot more than a typical zoo environment. You also get to hear the unique stories about how each animal came to the sanctuary..some stories are a little bit more saddening than others :(   I highly encourage any animal enthusiast to come here. It's a way more close-up and intimate experience, AND your money is going to a great cause.

Long story short: Come here for beer, not food.   I ordered a "southwest" chicken salad.  The salad did not resemble a southwest chicken salad in the slightest. It was obvious that it was half-hazardly put together with spare pizza ingredients (see pics) and cold diced chicken that my fiancé thought was tofu. I wanted to order something else since I was absolutely starving but the waiter never came back to check on how we liked our food. We had places to be so unfortunately, I left hungry.   Kind of musty and dark inside and smelled a bit like a basement. There's a lot of spare draft handles around which were neat to look at and a lot of beer memorabilia (signs, stickers)  With places around like O.H.S.O. and Four Peaks that nail food AND beer, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.

Yum! Can't wait to return for a full-blown dinner here.  Came here for impromptu apps/drinks this past Sunday and was very impressed.  Not only is the location and ambience unlike ANYTHING you'll find in Phoenix, the food was pretty amazing as well. Are you in the cabin of a fisherman's boat in the middle of the Pacific? Are you in the Arizona desert? You'll never know the difference here.  We pulled up a seat at the bar and ordered a dozen oysters, shrimp cocktail, and fish tacos.   Let me first say that the oysters were HUGE (see pics). The biggest I've ever seen - this might be the first time in my life that I've been full from oysters..the largest shells were the size of my entire palm! I asked one of the bartenders where they came from and he said Chesapeake Bay since the gulf of Cali doesn't produce the best oysters. I found it surprising they were all the way from the East Coast.. they were very fresh.  Sensing a theme here,the cocktail shrimp were also ginormous and super tasty. Cocktail sauce (has some kick!) tasted homemade, and didn't seem like it came out of a plastic tub.  Shrimp/fish tacos were very yummy. They definitely didn't skimp on the portions when they stuffed the tacos and the sauce + coleslaw also had some spicy kick!  To finish, we ordered the Banana Foster. HOLY COW. It was gone in maybe 3 minutes flat. I'd go back just for that.  While this is an upscale restaurant, don't expect to find the nicest of nice things here. The restaurant has been open since the late 70's/early 80's and not much renovation has happened since as evident through the bar cabinets, furniture, etc. I did find it oddly charming the super skinny door entrances (you really feel like you're on a boat!) and that there were high tank toilets with a chain in the bathrooms.   We will be back soon! :)

I really hate giving 1 stars to businesses but in First Class Auto's case, it is whole-heartedly deserved.   New to the city and looking for a reputable auto shop, I stumbled upon First Class Auto through a quick search on Yelp. With my out-of-state tags expiring this month and after failing my emissions test, I needed to remedy the issue somewhat quickly to avoid driving around with expired tags.  The repair needed was a replaced EGR valve and o2 sensors..a quick search online or call to another shop finds that those 2 parts together for my make and model of car should come to about $100-120. The cost for 45 minutes of work + diagnostic was $400. FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS.   When my fiance picked up my car and asked about the price, all the technician could answer was that that was the price for the "factory part". I'm not quite sure what performance grade part he thought I needed, but I drive 2002 Pontiac Grand Am. Let's be real, it's a sucky car. I literally need it to get me from point A to point B so that I can get through the next 1-2 years without dealing with a car payment. It was absolutely frustrating beyond belief to be charged that amount for the work that was done and I felt completely cheated and taken advantage of.    I would not recommend this place to anyone. It was a truly unfortunate experience and I felt like I ended up being the victim of someone else's incompetency. I should've read the writing on the wall, as it really seemed like the folks working here were not on the same page. When I called in yesterday (and expressing the urgency to have my repair done), the guy said to bring in my car first thing Sat. morning to have it looked at. When I arrived to the shop when it opened, the guy at the counter said "yeah I don't even know why he had you bring it in, I have 20 people ahead of you." My initial thoughts were "great, so I just spent my Sat. morning to drive over here and have someone tell me they're not even going to look at my car today"  The worst experience I've had anywhere in awhile and what's worse, I'm out $400 bucks.

Great atmosphere. Amazing beer. Delicious food. We will definitely be back. The cheese enchiladas were good enough to be at a Mexican restaurant. My fiance ordered the fried chickens sandwich (I didn't try it) and really liked it.. I had some of his fries..so yummy and crisp! Love love love!

Finally made it here tonight after passing by the Scottsdale and Tempe locations on various occasions and commenting on how neat it looked.. Definitely very satisfied with our first of many visits to come.  We arrived around 8 pm on a Wednesday night and were surprised to find a wait.. Not a problem though as we found a spot at the bar to post up at. I ordered the Monosso Chianti while my fiancé ordered four peaks 8th ave. Coming from a wine snob, the wine was very reasonably priced for the quality of taste.  Our table was on the patio.. It was bit chilly outside but they also had the a/c blasting inside.. A lose/lose scenario for a cold-sensitive person such as myself. I requested the outside heater above our table to be turned on..Within about 5 minutes, the heater was running and we actually ended up being way more comfortable and warm than we were waiting inside at the bar under the a/c. I really appreciated the quickness of service in that regard!  I ordered the Kale Caesar salad while my fiancé ordered the chicken parm. My one complaint isn't even a true complaint but rather a personal preference and suggestion.. The size of my salad was so large it was falling off my plate. It took some serious work to eat from it and not make an absolute mess. I get that some restaurants go for the "shock and awe" of large portions, but it was a bit frustrating to eat and I wished that it had been placed within a bowl. Otherwise, everything was absolutely delicious and the service was great.   Busy spot - Even late on a week night! As my fiancé always says.. "All those people can't be wrong"   Superb pricing for great food and atmosphere - We loved the interior and exterior decor. It has a great retro 50's vibe complete with old movies playing on old styled tvs.  Can't wait to revisit! Thank you Oregano's!

This time I made sure I ordered right. Got the Presidential Special (2 cheese and onion enchiladas with rice and beans) and OH MY GOODNESS was it amazing. Their enchilada sauce is delicious.. Sweet and savory.   We sat at the bar to catch some of the NFL game on and noticed a lot of regulars.. I'm a bit jealous that a lot of these people seemed to live within walking distance.   Will definitely return (again and again)!

My fiance and I are both VERY new to town (like 1 week new) and we both have an eye for mid century modern design and architecture. I had read some great reviews about the place..so without hesitation, I made us a reservation for Friday night at 7.   We came early and got a drink in the lounge. I love that their happy hour goes to 7, I feel you don't find that at a lot of places. I was surprised at the fact that it wasn't super busy. Friday night.. swanky spot in Scottsdale.. surely there'd more people but perhaps we're onto something by going to a hotel restaurant that I'm sure a lot of the locals forget is there.  We were taken care of and the food was out of this world. I ordered the Salmon and it was amazing..so smokey! Not to mention, the ambience is PERFECT. I felt like I was on an episode of Mad Men. It really takes you back to another era. So cool!  We will definitely be back. My fiance and I both agreed we'd love to take family and friends here when they come to visit!

Can't believe I hadn't tried LGO pizza before!   I've heard Phoenix is an unsuspecting spot for some of the best pizza in the country, and the much-raved-about LGO did not disappoint.  We went with the Gladiator pizza to share.. wasn't too cheesy, not too sauce-y. The sausage had a nice bite to it and pepperoni was yummy. Crispy crust and loved the subtle notes of parmesan that came through with every bite. In addition, I also ordered the kale & quinoa salad with rotisserie chicken. WOW! Awesome salad and a solid portion. Loved how all the ingredients jived with one another and the cervil vinagrette dressing was like the cherry on top.   Great set up. I've been in the daytime for their grab-n-go section, and the ambience from day to night is almost a 180 degree difference. Romantic dim lighting (especially in the "tasting room" section in back) made for a wonderful setting for dinner. We grabbed a bottle of Malbec to pair with our dinner. For you wine-o's out there: they have a lovely selection of nicely-priced bottles available in the grocery section that they will uncork for you for no additional fee. Holla!  Before leaving, we checked out the grocery/store section..tons of fun, unique and quirky gifts. We also made a stop at the gelato counter. I really liked that they offered miniature portions - it was the perfect sweet cap to a fantastic dinner and experience.  Will return (again and again!)

A brief history - Aj's used to be the first stop that my aunt would take us after we landed at the airport back when I used to come out and visit as a kid so naturally when I moved here, it was the first place I wanted to do my grocery shopping!  How do I love  Aj's? Let me count thy ways.  Let me start by their grab and go section. The folks behind the counter are ALWAYS so wonderfully nice, pleasant, and patient while I indecisively attempt to pick out items for my fiance and [healthy] items for myself. The food is superb..as it should be (ahem..$$$). I haven't been able to try out a ton of their stuff, but from what I have had (bacon-wrapped pork, salmon with lobster cream sauce, shrimp & crab stuffed mushrooms, etc) it's been absolutely delicious.   They also happen to carry my FAVE brand of candles (Roots) in my favorite scent (Rosemary Eucalyptus) so bonus points there. I love their assortment of random decor throughout the store - every time I shop here I find myself sifting through vases and nice serving trays I have absolutely no need for.. but i can't help myself, it's a solid selection!  The attendant in the wine section has helped me a time or two and has been pretty spot on with his recommendations. They also have wine chilling coolers and a tasting station (um can I get invited to tasting? :) )  Oh and let's not forget that they carry Jeni's, a gourmet ice cream that is made in my home state of Ohio. It was tough to come by in Nashville, and thought I'd said goodbye for good when we came to AZ - but alas they have it here!  Check out is a breeze and staff if always friendly and offers to help with carry out.  Love this spot!

A+ for ambience and atmosphere. The outside area at night is BEYOND romantic and gorgeous.. And the inside is just as cool.  I had the salmon Caesar salad which was pretty yummy and oddly filling? Haha Or perhaps I was already full from the absolutely amazing basil/pesto/olive oil spread that was served with our bread. Regardless, it was a good-sized salad.  My fiancé had the spinach and veal ravioli which was downright melt-in-your-mouth amazing. While it could've probably been enough for me, he arrived starving so he was still somewhat hungry after finishing his meal in a whopping 5 minutes.  Luckily we had the bread and he had some of my salad but I do have to admit it couldn't have more than maybe 8 ravioli pieces? And for the price, that definitely wasn't enough.. Hence the 4 star rating vs 5 star.  We'll still be back.. I love their patio area and wine selection, maybe this time we'll get an app for my fiancé!

Came here Saturday evening for a healthy bite and to enjoy the amazing weather on the patio. I was little surprised that at 6:30 pm, it wasn't busy at all!  Great menu selection, more versatile and healthy than Panera.  I went with the Caesar salad and added on salmon.. To add it on, I believe the cost was $2-3 which is almost unheard of. Once I got my salad, I realized why the salmon was priced that way as it wasn't actually grilled fresh in the back, but rather was cooked at an earlier time, refrigerated and then put on the salad cold. I was kinda of bummed, because I feel that it really lacked flavor.   Other than that, the salad was great.. Great food for the price and I felt it was of the same quality that you'd find at a more up-scale restaurant.   I was the only patron on the patio and really appreciated the staff's attentiveness in coming out to make sure I was enjoying my meal and checking if I needed anything else.

Ahhh.. this was such a refreshing little mid day treat! Tucked away off of Goldwater and next to the Museum of the West, this quaint little wine bar was a great find thanks to Groupon.  We did the wine tasting and app for two, ordering a caprese plate to share and ending the tasting by getting a glass of our fave wine. My favorite was the Pinot Noir - so buttery and smooth! The food was pretty decent too.. huge pieces of tomatoes and mozzarella.  The master wine maker (who you would never guess is the master wine maker) also doubled as the sole server. Though not a big place, they definitely could've used an extra body in there to help wait. We found ourselves sitting for a while between tastings.. not our server's fault but created some lulls during the tasting.  Excited to come back with my fiance's parents in a few weeks. Great wine spot!

While our waiter was great, the time it took for our apps to arrive (raw oysters and  shrimp) was a bit delayed - not sure what the hold up was as those items literally require zero prep. Additionally, the "jumbo" shrimp weren't jumbo at all which was a bit disappointing.   My fiance's cajun pasta (which came with no pasta but rice) was mediocre and my yellowfin tuna was a bit bland and rather flavorless.. I did enjoy the mashed potatoes and asparagus however.  The inside decor is very much themed, something that you would find at Disney World. Not quite authentic but still somewhat charming in the midst of a desert, nonetheless.  Par-level seafood at best. Would much rather pay more and go to the Salt Cellar or Buck and Rider. Won't return but glad we got to try this spot out finally!

Tried this place out for a second time after Michelle, the manager, reached out to me about my fiance and I's last experience. I really appreciated the extra step in her reaching out and inviting us back for a better experience.  We started out with the raw oyster sampler.. delish! I only wish that the waiter would've stopped by and pointed out which was Oyster was which so I could know which ones to order next time. Otherwise, they arrived in a timely fashion and with all the yummy condiment additions.   I ordered the jumbo lump crab small plate as my entree with a side of grilled asparagus. Nice and filling portions of crab meat, drizzled in a spicy cocktail sauce and atop a bed of diced cucumber. The asparagus side is enough to share between people so don't let the price deter you from ordering it..it comes drizzled in soy sauce and breadcrumbs. For you health nuts, my dish left me satisfied without feeling like I busted my diet. Just maybe don't wash it down with 3 glasses of wine like I did :)  My fiance ordered lobster tail and a medium prepared steak with a sides of mac n' cheese and whipped potatoes. He enjoyed everything (he ate the lobster tail in no time!) but the steak which was a bit over prepared and tough.  Our server did a great job all in all, was attentive without being too in our space.   I truly appreciate Michelle going above and beyond to ensure we had a better experience. We will most definitely return to King's next time we are around Tempe and craving some seafood!

What a pleasant surprise this place was!   One of my coworkers was in the mood for Thai after a work function. Though I'm not super familiar with the cuisine (I've maybe had it 2x ever), I'm not a picky eater so I figured I'd give it a shot.  The vegetarian yellow curry dish was ABSOLUTELY amazing. The creaminess of the curry and coconut milk paired with the veggies and rice literally melted in my mouth.   Service was wild fast for lunch time. As soon as our butts hit the chairs, we were served ice cold glasses of water along with menus. A few minutes later, we were served a side salad that came with our meal. Honestly, the salad couldn't be anything much more than bagged iceberg lettuce, but it had the most amazing peanut dressing on it. It wasn't hard to gobble up and I can see why they sell it by the bottle for customers to take home.  About 10-15 minutes later, our entrees were served. Super yummy food and great experience all around. Definitely excited to return!

This a health nut/vegetarian's paradise!  We came here for brunch with friends this past Sunday and were pleasantly surprised.   My fiancé is more of a burger and fries type of guy and when he first glanced over the menu, wasn't too sure he'd find something he'd like. Even from a health nut perspective, I was a bit unsure myself as I studied the menu. A lot of the meal descriptions have a list of odd and peculiar combinations of ingredients.. It was hard to picture what the dish might look like or if the flavors would go well together.  We played it pretty safe - He went with the breakfast burrito and I went with kale salad + chicken. We both really enjoyed our meals and felt guilt free about our food choices. Everything was fresh, service was attentive, and surprisingly there was no wait at 11:45 AM on the weekend in a popular area of town.  Great covered patio that allows for ample seating in the shade. Inside is trendy and allows full visibility into the kitchen so that patrons may see the staff prepping everything from scratch.

Solid spot in the heart of Arcadia.  Food is always good - I've had their wings, mozzarella sticks, nachos, and the buffalo chicken wrap. If you are blue cheese dunker when it comes to wings, this place has AMAZING blue cheese dressing with ginormous cheese chunks in the dressing. Hello calories!  Also, the nachos are MASSIVE. I made the sorry mistake of ordering them just for myself as an entree and tried to eat half of it. Definitely an uphill battle.. no pun intended.. it's literally a hill of nachos.  We've found service to be a bit spotty. A couple times we've had to flag down a waitress for refills or another round of beers.  Parking can be a bit of a mess. Go buy a lottery ticket if you happen to find a parking spot during dinner hour here because that is something that very rarely happens.  Sports bar type of atmosphere. One side of the restaurant has 3 huge screens on the wall - excellent for game watching!

To be honest, I was a little drunk when I arrived, so the specific details of our dinner here aren't exactly crystal clear. With that being said, everything was memorably delicious .. As a table, we ordered the pretzel app with cheese fondue, and I ordered the grilled cheese sliders and fries. Sure, those are items that are tough to mess up, but I appreciate that these otherwise standard items were definitely done right. The bread of my sliders was toasted to perfection .. in addition the the cheese, there was bacon and tomatoes on each slider as well. My fiancé, who has had meatloaf in probably 100+ restaurants,  really enjoyed his meat loaf entree. Service was prompt, food was great, ambience and overall prime old town Scottsdale location was an A+, oh, and drinks were never empty!   Definitely can't wait to go back and try some other items on the menu. The prices are pretty reasonable as well - another nod to my 5 star rating!

I'm so glad I finally got to try this place out! I'd never heard of the chain until I moved out to Phoenix and had thought it was nothing more than something similar to a Pita Pit...Not the case!   While their menu did have some pita options, it offered many other diverse mediterranean dishes...everything ranging from Mahi Mahi to Chicken Masala, to pesto spinach salad dishes. Wow!  The group went with the hummus trio app (jalapeno cilantro, original, and red pepper) and the tzatziki sauce with fresh pita bread and pita chips - so fresh and flavorful, especially the jalapeno cilantro - a must try!   My spinach pasta dish was  delicious and filling (the portions are pretty big!).. pesto pasta abed spinach with a lemon vinaigrette.   While the service was a bit spotty (we had a group of 10 during the lunch rush), I will definitely be back!

Ugh. Where do I start?  We came here before the Coyotes game looking to grab a few drinks and food. New to town and not familiar with the area, we picked this place as I noticed there was a 20% off voucher on the Yelp app and the place wasn't too busy.  Should've. Read. The. Reviews.   Terrible food. Below par would be putting it lightly. Dirty tables (they were super sticky!) Decent service but that can only go so far.   My saving grace and only justifiable reason for picking such a terrible place was going to be for the 20% off coupon but when I tried to use it, the waitress said its not redeemable on game days.   What a letdown! DONT go here.

New to town and was looking for a new regular nail spot to go to. I read great reviews about this spot so figured I'd give 'er a go. I get gel manicures regularly and they typically last about 2 wks max. I am currently 2.5 going on 3 wks with a gel manicure from this place and it still looks FABULOUS. i will DEFINITELY be back :) :) :)

Quick service. An eclectic menu. Decent prices for a hip restaurant in a trendy area.   I ordered their salmon which was super succulent. Though I'm not quite sure what else was on my dish (refer back to "eclectic" comment), all the flavors complimented each other perfectly. My fiancé ordered the roasted pork (?) with mashed potatoes. I had a few bites and it literally melted in my mouth. Good lord.   Excited to come back and try out some more dishes!

After finding a few other downtown restaurants packed before a sporting event, we decided to give Arrogant Butcher a try.   We walked in around 5 pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Soon after, we realized we had just barely beaten the dinnertime rush - score!  Since we weren't in the mood for gigantic meals, my fiancé and I opted to split the Jumbo Shrimp and Oyster apps and the Fish N' Chips plate. The shrimp arrived and were HUGE.. well worth the $3ish dollar/piece that they were priced at. Oysters were pretty standard in size and taste.   When our entree arrived at the table, I was happy to see that the kitchen had already split the Fish N' Chips onto two separate plates as the portion was quite large - Definitely enough to have 2 adults feeling quite full! The battered and fried fish arrived warm and had a lovely crispiness to them. The side of fries arrived warm and tasted freshly deep fried as well.  My only drawback is that as restaurant got busier, our waiter seemed to drop off with his service (for instance, we had to flag down another waiter for more cocktail sauce) and it seemed we waited a bit longer than normal for raw seafood apps. Otherwise, our experience was great and we'd definitely consider returning next time we are in DT PHX!

We came here for brunch on a Sunday and loved the $5 dollar "pitchas" of beer they offer. I ordered their salmon kale Caesar salad and my fiancé ordered the Windsor style backyard burger with Mac and cheese. Both were absolutely delicious!  I enjoy eating healthy but rarely do you see a salad coming your way on a server's tray and think "wow I can't wait to eat that". However, I found myself thinking that exact thing when my salad made its way to the table. The biscuit croutons are a nice little contrast to the kale and the salmon was cooked just right.  Service was spotty at best.. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes before someone greeted us but the food made up for it. Will be back and hopefully better service next time!

If you're looking for authentic street tacos.. This is your spot! As first timers, we weren't quite sure what to order but the ladies behind the counter were great about offering up samples.   I tried my first horchata - wow! It's very sweet but tastes similar to vanilla almond milk.   My fiancé and his brother had 2 orders of tacos (they ate about 10 each!) so that they could try out all the different meats. The tacos aren't terribly big so if you're starving you'll probably want to order quite a few.   I had the barbacoa beef burrito bowl.. Yum yum yum! The beef was very juicy and melted in my mouth. Can't wait to go back!

I'm glad we finally got to try out this wonderful little spot in our neighborhood.   Soon after we were seated, we were greeted by the server who offered up complimentary zucchini chips as it was our first time. While super tasty, the chips were a bit on the salty side.  We ordered the calamari app to start, our first thoughts were that that marinara sauce was missing. However, we soon learned that the calamari didn't need it.. Rested atop lemon vinaigrette arugula, the calamari was very flavorful and tender and the breading was a lot more fresh than other places. Very delicious!  Since I had filled up a lot on the apps, I ordered a Caesar salad. Nothing crazy. My fiancé ordered the bolognese pasta which I sampled..oddly reminded me of having Chef Boy Ardee or Spaghetti O's as a kid. I'm not sure if that's good or bad, but it sure was scrumptious!  Service was superb! There was a lull in getting our food out to which our server addressed and apologized for. He offered us warm bread with vinegar and oil while we waited and also treated us to dessert free of charge after the meal - we totally appreciated this gesture and attention! I feel like a lot of places don't address that type of issue when it happens but it was definitely noticed and we were impressed.  Excited to come back! Keep up the great service :)

Unfortunately, I had a very lack-luster first experience here this past week.   I work about a block away and was on the hunt for a healthy alternative to the norm that is found around the Arizona Center so I ventured here with a coworker.  I decided to go with the Caesar Salad and instead of having the grilled chicken that comes with it, asked for salmon instead.   The first thing that seemed peculiar was that my total came to ~$12 (unfortunately, I did not keep the receipt). The Caesar with Grilled Chicken ($6.75) plus salmon ($3.00) should come to around $10 as I did not order a drink. I wait the 10 minutes or so for my number to called..I walk up to grab the salad, take a look down, and quickly realize this is definitely not the salad I ordered. I place it back up on the counter and tell the owner, "this isn't my salad" to which he snarkliy replies "well that's why I called the number". At this point, I'm thinking I made the mistake and heard the wrong number. I go back and sit patiently..awaiting what must be the most amazing caesar salad in the world, as it's been about 15 minutes at this point.  There's some commotion behind the counter and one of the workers comes out and notifies me that that was indeed the salad I ordered. Well no.. no it's not. My coworker verifies that I indeed said "caesar salad with salmon". I state that I must've been charged the $12 because they had the order wrong to which the worker says that the salmon I added on is $5, and not the $3 that's on the menu.   No where on the menu does it say that salmon is $5 to add on. Nowhere.   The worker tries to bargain with me.. stating that the wrong salad that was made is actually "a better salad" than the caesar I ordered. For what, price? value? quality? She states that because I ordered the caesar salad with salmon, that I implied I wanted the "grilled salmon salad" and that I should've made it more clear that I wanted the caesar salad and the salmon added on. What's the difference? At this point, the worker is making absolutely zero sense.   They bring out the corrected salad, I eat most of it, and we leave (btw the salad tasted decent but that's a moot point).   At no point was there a refund offered or an apology. Instead, I felt that I was treated rather rudely for bringing up logical questions about my meal that was screwed up and that I was overcharged for.   Do I care about the $2? Not really. But it's the principle of it. This place had so much potential, but I'm not sure I will return after such a bad first impression in terms of service.

Bring your appetite!   We came here before the Reds/SF Giants spring training game and walked away with sauerkraut and brat (and beer) filled bellies.   Service was great, we appreciated the waitress' urgency in getting our app and beer ordered just minutes before HH ended. The one draw back was our burnt pretzel..I was absolutely starving so I was still able to eat it but it was just not the best. A bit of a disappointment since we were eating at a German spot but didn't make or break our experience. Brats are huge to the point you don't even need to order a side. The sauerkraut is to-die-for, much more fresh and crispy than your typical store-bought canned variety! Yummy curry ketchup available at each table.   Their beer garden is a wonderful spot for casual brews - bistro lights adorn the trees and there is ample seating that can accommodate parties both large and small.   This is my spot go-to PHX spot when I need to  fulfill my German cravings..Can't wait to return!

If I could include everything that makes me happy, it would be the Phoenix Drybar.  To give a little bit of background, I first became familiar with Drybar  through Sephora when I lived in Nashville and became familiar with their products. However, Nashville didn't have a Drybar location so the only impression I had was the dryer kit I had bought that included rollers, The Sheriff hairspray, and a bristle brush. I had also tried out  the Southern Belle mousse as well and had very good experiences with it (before airport security took it away from me) :(  As soon as I moved to PHX, I was waiting for the right occasion to try this place out, and with engagement pics, I thought, this is the perfect time.   Awesome experience. The wash stations were comfortable on the neck.. Because let's be honest, we all notice when wash sinks are NOT comfortable at all and are sore the next day.. A huge win in my book if the salon gets this part down.   My stylist took ample time to wash my hair and massage my scalp and added in a neck massage as well.. Very appreciated. In addition to near perfect hair (I got the southern comfort aka lots of volume) there were up-to-date mags and chick flicks running on the tvs.   My only suggestion would be to have alcohol though I'm not sure the AZ rules on this. In TN, any hair cut, nail salon appt typically offered a glass of wine free of charge with service, but it could be different law-wise here in the Wild West.   Can't wait to return!

Underwhelming to say the least. New to Phoenix and had seen this place around the city so was excited to try it out.  I guess I'll start with the happy hour skinny margarita I ordered.. $5 happy hour price for a watered down, overly iced concoction.. Not worth it and would certainly not worth the non happy hour price.   The chile con queso was tasty but we were kind of surprised that it came out somewhat lukewarm. We came in a little before 4 pm so not busy at all.. You think it'd came out piping hot.   My fiancé ordered the chicken enchiladas. We're both not picky but we both agreed they tasted like rubber.. Like the taste of what a garage smells like. It was so odd!   I ordered the appetizer quesadilla as my entree and it was okay. Nothing crazy.  I don't think we'll be back.. Too many other tasty Mexican joints in this town that  are cheaper and way tastier!

Tried this place out for the first time last night as my fiancé and I are brand new to town and wanting to try out nearby restaurants. Our pizza (the pepperoni) was decent, they have a great beer selection and offer some wine specials through the week. Tacos offered for taco Tuesday were also pretty tasty. Service was good..We will definitely be back!

I'd had this bookmarked for awhile and finally found the perfect night for my fiance and I to give this place a whirl.   For starters, the ambience absolutely cannot be beat. We ending up coming right at dusk, so the beautiful glow of low lighting paired with candles and live music made for a truly romantic setting.  I went with a glass of Malbec and my fiance went with a Manhattan. Both were absolutely delicious and worth the extra $$$. My one regret was not trying food from the bar menu..I guess that means we'll just have to return  (oh, darn!) :)  The property in and of itself is jaw-droppingly beautiful. I highly encourage anyone who visits for dinner/drinks to stroll the courtyards at night - it's pretty magical!  Can't wait to show this place off when we have guests visiting. A must-see when in Phoenix-Scottsdale!

I had heard about this spot and was dying to try it out! This weekend finally presented the perfect opportunity to visit the Mesa location as we found ourselves a bit more East in the valley than we are usually.  Walking in at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon, we were surprised to find just about every table in the main dining room full - ranging from large groups celebrating birthdays to families to couples.. and just about everything in between. As the old adage goes, all these people can't be wrong when it comes to food.  Our waiter, Brandon, did a fantastic job explaining the menu to us.. noting that the seafood comes as pictured on the menu (aka you have to dismantle the food yourself) and explaining the different sauces and spice levels. Within about 15-20 minutes, our bags of crab and shrimp arrived steaming hot and seeped in the Trifecta sauce (a blend of garlic, ole bay, and paprika I think?) which was absolutely heavenly. Though it would've been easier to disarm the crab using a mallet, we made it work with the seafood scissors.  We wrapped up the meal with Hurricanes to drink.. my first ever! For not being a fan of sweet tasting alcohol, it was pretty good (and had a kick too!)  Can't wait to return!

I'd been wanting to try this spot out for awhile but had put it on hold since my fiancé hadn't liked Hawaiian dishes he'd tried in the past. It just so happened that we found ourselves searching for a late night meal in Scottsdale and stumbled into Hula's.  First of all, as a mid century style buff, I loved the whole vibe going on inside. Hawaiian mod style with a few new age touches made for a pretty sweet and swanky setting.   I went with the fried fish bites app and a side of fries. Given the price point of the fish app (~$8-9), i fully expected the portions to be pretty small.. However the fish pieces were huge! My fiancé and I both could not come close to finishing them. Not only were the portions impressive for the price, but they tasted amazing! You could tell that they had just been battered and fried minutes beforehand. The side of fries were also just out of the deep fryer and were super yummy.  My fiancé went with the Jawaian Jerk Chicken plate which he said was quite possibly the best meal he's had since we moved to Arizona 6 months ago. I tried bites of the chicken and Johnny cakes and wow, I have to agree!   Service was great, ambience was awesome, and the food was outstanding.. Can't wait to return!

Nom!  Picked this place to eat on the eve of my man's birthday and was very impressed!  Great variety in the menu - everything from comfort food to omega-3 power plates.  We started off with the prosciutto-wrapped asparagus - it's worth the twelve or so dollars.. the asparagus spears are HUGE. With a fabulous grilled char on the asparagus and prosciutto and maple syrup for dipping, what wasn't to love?  I ordered the cobb salad - a tad bit too much dressing but otherwise delicious. Lots of yummy flavors; bleu cheese, onion, cherry tomatoes tossed with a creamy garlic dressing.   My fiance went with the brisket (savory and succulent) and jalapeno grits (OMG - party in my mouth).  Great service. We ordered the banana split for dessert and blue cheese stuff olives to-go for me (my secret indulgence).  We will definitely be back. Thank you Grassroots :)

Pretty quaint spot tucked away between Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods.  I love that you can walk right on over to their Wine Store, select a bottle, and take over to your table for no corking fee.   This place has a lovely, quaint atmosphere, not a ton too much seating and tons of low lighting that creates a glow on the wooden walls.  I went with the ricotta gnudi pasta for dinner - by the sounds of it, you'd think italian-style pasta full of marinara sauce right? Nope! This pasta is more of a hearty pot roast packed with slow-cooked au jus, vegetables, succulent pulled pork, and last but not least... ricotta stuffed gnudi pasta pieces! It wasn't quite what I was thinking when I ordered the dish, but it sure was tasty.   My one drawback was that the portion was a tad on the smaller size. It didn't help that it was served on a plate the size of a satellite either..it REALLY didn't look like I got much food then.  Solid little spot - give 'er a try!

After reading some great reviews, I really wanted this place to be amazing and expected it to be pretty good.  We came here on a whim late Sunday afternoon around 4 pm for a late lunch/early dinner. As soon as we entered, we were handed menus presumably by the manager and told they were only serving half of their happy hour items - the dinner menu wouldn't be available for another hour and the other happy hour items, they were out of.   Since my fiance was absolutely starving, we decided that we'd stay and find something from the limited menu to order.   From my 5 or so options, I took the the pork tacos, while my fiance took the ribs. We weren't impressed with either one. My pulled pork was pretty dry and lacked flavor... his ribs were about the same.   Along with a SUPER limited food menu, the beer list wasn't anything impressive. I think I counted 8 beers listed.  We left regretting going there and didn't understand why the dinner menu wasn't being served yet. Most of the items on the dinner menu wouldn't seem to take a lot of prep work.. I remember seeing salads, simple burgers/sandwiches  We ended up eating somewhere else after we left for a real dinner. Won't return, but glad we tried it out.  My advice - if you're going to serve an already super limited menu, make sure the food tastes amazing. Otherwise, give your patrons options regardless of if they're dining at 4pm (when you open) or 9pm.

Simple, tasty Italian with amazing and quick service. The staff was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of!  I ordered the shrimp pasta in a lemon garlic and wine sauce.. The shrimps were huge and delicious. The sauce was a little lemon-y to my liking but I wouldn't fault that to chef.. I just don't normally order that type of sauce. Bread came out warm and tasty. I liked that the portions weren't so big that you had to take it home.. My fiancé and I brought our appetites and both finished our dinners.   No complaints! My only suggestion would be lower lighting to add to the already pretty casual ambience.. The bright lighting reminded me of eating somewhere fast food.

Great selection of healthy items..everything from grab n' go juices, juices & smoothies, and nutritional snacks to quinoa and veggie packed entree dishes.  Friendly and fast service. Convenient spot downtown in Cityscape. A little expensive (I paid $10 for a salad) but you get a lot of salad for that price. I felt like I ate forever on it and by the time I threw it away it looked as if I'd barely made a dent.   Will definitely return to try out additional menu items!

I had been wanting to come here FOREVER but it is so hard to get in this place on a Saturday or Sunday morning! We finally had the perfect opportunity this past weekend as we were up early running errands around town.   Our first impressions:  Front hostess was super peppy and warm, not just to us, but to everyone..even as the line grew out the door. Her enthusiasm was contagious!   Casual and laid back retro atmosphere. The Tempe location draws a somewhat versatile crowd but it's truly the perfect spot for families and hung-over twenty-somethings alike.   Our server, Savannah, did a fantastic job. She noted that it was our first time, and treated us to a pineapple upside down pancake which literally left me speechless it tasted so good! I am definitely ordering pancakes next time!  My eggs and chicken sausage plate tasted great - I ordered more on the boring side unfortunately. Mimosa came out pretty quickly and was a solid size for the $6.  Overall, this is a no-brainer 5 star rating for amazing food and even amazing-er (yeah, I just made up a word) service!

Passed by this spot on the way to Grabbagreen (how ironic) and couldn't pass up bringing back doughnuts for the office.   Super warm and fresh! They actually pull the doughnuts out of the oil and then dress it according to your order. Of the ones my office team and I tried (Salty Caramel, S'mores, Caramel Chocolate Chip) I preferred the salty caramel.. salty and sugary goodness paired with a freshly caramel glazed and fried doughnut? Count me in!  Excellent find in Cityscape and will soon return to try out more.. my eye is on the strawberry shortcake one for next time!

Staff is friendly and super informative when it comes to drinks and cigar selections.   Good-sized humidor and solid drink selection. Vast amount of seating and the ambience is quaint and casual...come here with friends or by yourself - you'll be at home either way.  My only desire would be for an app menu but perhaps there are ordinances surrounding smoking establishments and dining?  Great location in old town .. can't wait to return!

We chose Frasher's as runner up after we had a failed attempt trying to go to Little Miss (that place is ALWAYS so dang packed!)  Another AZ BBQ experience in which we realized we are no longer in Tennessee anymore.  Meat was okay.. not the best, but certainly not the worse we've had. The sides though. God bless those sides...  I ordered the turkey sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. The mac n cheese tasted fine, but it was extremely runny and soupy. No thickness to it at all.  My poor fiance ordered their mashed potatoes as a side to the three meat platter. When the plate came out, we thought the mashed potatoes were grits (see attached photo). In addition to their watered down appearance, they were pretty bland and ended up forming a solid mass by the end of our lunch -  we were a bit disappointed. The bbq sauce was okay, but tasted like it came out of a huge tub.  My recommendations:  In addition to improving the side items, I would highly recommend sweet tea be served, an absolute staple paired with BBQ. We were baffled as to why they were serving some sort of tropical kiwi/watermelon tea by the soda machine at a bbq place.

My fiance chose this as a surprise dinner spot for my birthday after I'd hinted at wanting to go here a time or two ;)  Excellent fresh seafood, vibe & atmosphere, and attentive service. No wait on a Tuesday night which was nice.  We started off with the oysters from WA and BC,WOW! Super fresh.. my favorite was the Kusshi from BC. I could've eaten 2 dozen of those!  I ordered the whitefish daily special (some variety of mediterranean seabass) with brocollini. The fish came out in 2 separate filets, was lightly breaded and covered in a garlic butter sauce that was so good, I probably could've drank it. I tried a few bites of my fiance's Milano Pasta Troife, which was absolutely amazing .. succulent pieces of shrimp and sausage in pasta and a flavorful garlic sauce. I'd love to order that next time!  The waitress treated us to lemon meringue pie as a bday treat - to no surprise, this was amazing as well and we gobbled it up.   There's a few wood fires around the restaurants that make the place smell ungodly good. The low lighting makes for an intimate and romantic ambience - great date spot.  Can't wait to return. Thanks for a wonderful birthday dinner, Buck & Rider!

I'm not a huge deep dish eater, but this place definitely made me think twice about my preference for NY style 'za by the time we were through.  First of all, the location within Uptown Plaza combined with the interior retro feel of the dining area made me instantly happy. I love all things mid-century, so the wood paneling and abundant cone wall sconces made for some great eye candy as we waited for our tasty pizza.  We placed our order (medium classic deep dish) as soon as we checked in and the total time it took for it to arrive at our table was about an hour. We ended up snagging a seat at the bar in lieu of a table and passed the time with conversation, people watching, and a few beers.  The pizza was absolutely amazing - it's just a shame I was only able to eat one piece! Thick cuts of Italian sausage throughout and that buttery crust?! YUM!!! Sauce on top was fantastic and really everything all in all was just a great experience.  5 stars!

Always quick service with a smile at this location and delicious juices. I've had detox and greenie and they are both consistently good.   Great location within Tempe Marketplace and late hours..I've found some of the other Nekter locations close around 7!   One of these days I will need to try an Acai bowl!

Came here with a large work group after a volunteering function and we had the most amazing lunch!  Eating healthy for my upcoming wedding, I went with what I believe was the only salad on the menu. Everyone knows that you don't order salads at Mexican restaurants.. The real flavor is typically in the cheesiest and greasiest dishes... :)  It's be an understatement to say I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and flavorful this salad was! The dressing had a nice but not overpowering cilantro flavor, the fajita style peppers added a zesty greasy flavor (but without all those calories), and the shrimp I ordered a top the salad was grilled to perfection.   Service was great considering the size of the group. Overall, zero complaints in terms of service and food quality.  Casual and clean atmosphere, would definitely return for that scrumptious salad!
