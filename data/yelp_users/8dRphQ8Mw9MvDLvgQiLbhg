Reading some of the reviews for this airport, mine is definitely different because I never have a good experience here, especially this past weekend. What erked me the most was that the bathrooms were dirty, felt like it hasn't been cleaned for days. And it wasn't just me, other travelers passed by the stalls and just left the bathroom, even trying to go to the other restrooms, it was the same thing. And I'm not sure what side of the airport it is, but there are no outlets to charge your phone or other electronic devices, which really was annoying. If you're laying over in Phoenix, just beware that you might have to hike to your other gate and when you walk through the other terminals, be sure to watch out for the carts that give rides to people, they might just run you over. The rental car place is a separate building and it was nice because it was all in one facility, but the buses to transport travelers gets full pretty fast, especially if there are families, so just make sure to lineup.

Comparable to Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles in Southern California, Lo-Lo's is pretty good!  Open late with no long waits to be seated especially with a big group, Lo-Lo's is a place to visit in Arizona for some good chicken and waffles. Portions are good, but if you have a big appetite, then order 2. I thought it was cool that they served their drinks in jars. An extra plus for me was that they served Mountain Dew Code Red, and I thought that drink didn't exist in fountain drink options, so totally loved that!
