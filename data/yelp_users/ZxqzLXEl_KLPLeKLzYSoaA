Been out of state just over 3 weeks now & I am suffering. We are Craving SB food bad. The Giovanni sauce is to die for folks! You just gotta try it on the wings....or the Lemon Pepper Wings.... Best you'll ever have! Ribs are yummy. Pizza is amazing. And the Fettuccine Alfredo is absolutely scrumptious! No other sports bar in town compares & with every sport on over 140 TV's....it's a Pretty cool Sports Bar! Stop by & see for yourself!

Hey Santisi Family & team. I am slow to update, but I just had to fill you in.  A few weeks ago I came in with my 2 nieces. It was quite early & I think it was a Tuesday. There was only a hand full of people at the bar. The bartender was extremely curtious & very patient as my kids wanted to run around & play video games and not tell us what they wanted to eat. Anyways, I ordered 2 orders of chicken strips & fries, a salad & sprites to share between us. First off, you have, by far, the very BEST tasting chicken strips I have ever tasted. Not kidding guys! The chicken was really juicy and the breading is very tasty & perfectly crispy.  I don't think they are the same as I used to get, but either way....whatever you are doing differently...keep doing it!  We absolutely Loved them! And, WOW... the portions were HUGE! We couldn't even finish one order of them.  Now, your Ranch dressing is so delicious that the girls only want it from "'Tisi's" & they want to eat it on everything! Lol.  Your BBQ sauce is great & mixed with the ranch dressing was quite yummy... Folks you have gotta try them together on a salad. I swear it was soooo good.  But, the Giovanni sauce is just so damn amazing that it can be poured on anything & everything! I eat it on my salad, wings, ribs, chicken breast dinner, even dip my pizza crust in it. You name it.... It's incredible!  So, can't you bottle this stuff?

Extremely disappointed with your services today!! I Took my best friend here for her birthday. We wanted to spend a fun time together both getting pedicures. We sat side by side in chairs and our pedicures began at the exact same time! The Bday girls lady rushed her pedicure so quickly, she was done in 1/2 the time mine was. Her toes looked absolutely horrible! My 3 year old little cousin could have done a better job! You should be embarassed! The worst I have ever seen:(  Anyways, A different lady that was doing the bday girls manicure completely ignored what she wanted and just did it to match her pedicure! She said "same color but a fade not french!"  Everyone heard her saying it over & over. She wanted a pink glitter fade! This is not how you do business! You dont pretend you dont understand! You listen!!  You should have fixed them, but you did it your way!!  Im not done, theres more! .... My lady made me turn off my spa chair bcuz she couldn't polish my toes with it on! WTHeck? Then you shouldn't be doing pedicures missy!! Anyways ladies, you just lost 2 good customers... plus all the ones we tell just how awful your service was today. We will never be back!!  Buyer Beware: Run!  Dont bother with this place cuz you'll just ruin your day... & the next day getting them polished elsewhere. Biggest waste of $108 I have ever spent!

Horrible service! As soon as we were seated our Male server said, "Let me guess, you have a groupon. All my tables have groupons tonight & it's annoying."  Hmmm there goes your tip!  We Called the manager the next day & she didn't seem to care. We Won't be returning!  And if you don't want the groupons, DONT OFFER THEM!

I read all the reviews before I came in today. This place has almost 5 stars? Are you kidding me? First of all the guy working the counter ( said he's the owner) had a horrible personality. Kinda rude. Extremely slow. Second, I had the worst Philly cheesesteak I have ever ordered. The meat, bell peppers and onions were just barely warm & were microwaved! Gross! I ordered it with bacon and the guy forgot to put it on. Extremely overpriced for a sub joint. I've had much better from Stevie's, Chiba Hut, Jimmy Johns, & Firehouse. Sad to say but even Subway is better. Very disappointed!

Been here a few times in the past month. I'm completely addicted. I have always ordered something different. Today I let our server, Evelyn, order for me! She nailed it! She ordered the #6 pho... Spicy w/ beef, shrimp, tripe, meatballs etc. Absolutely delicious! She also recommended the #3 entree....steak, pork, shrimp w/ salad, pho & rice. Couldn't have done better at choosing our meals myself! Angelina's is very clean and comfortable. Love these black chairs;) Staff here is quite personable and friendly. Evelyn is super sweet and has a great sense of humor. Sushi bar is coming along so I can't wait to try it...once they get a sushi chef here. I highly recommend Angelina's folks! One of My favorite restaurants!

Glad that I didn't trust the off reviews I've read on here and tried the Arrowhead location for myself. After walking out of a local sports bar that was not on their game, we decided to try Zipps in Glendale.  I must say, I was surprised! I had a great time Friday night.The place was packed. And Wow... some really cute guys in here. ;)  Everyone was either watching a game, hanging with friends, laughing and/or just having a great time! Definitely not the same atmosphere from other sports bars within the area.  Anyways, I ordered a Coors Light, Wings, fries & Salad. My food was excellent! The Wings were super crispy and super tasty. The golden wing sauce was really yummy. My beer was ice cold. Our server was extremely friendly and totally on top of things...she had no name tag, so I can't give her a thumbs up on here because I don't remember her name. But, I must say, the customer service at this location is really great! We saw our server at least 10 times and the manager must have stopped at our table to talk to us like 3 times. Definitely makes your experience pretty amazing when you have a fun atmosphere, great service and super yummy food! Zipps, you sure nailed it last night. Trifecta! :)
