I've lived near this place for over a year and never thought to check them out.  What a fool I was!  It's set up like your typical carwash but they don't have machines that wash the cars, they have people!  Its a family owned company that I learned has been in that location for 25 years.  I love supporting local business and it was cool meeting one of the family members who own and run the car wash.  They seem to have their system down pretty well, it was busy and I didn't have to wait too long.  I will be going back for sure.

The food is better than I would have expected but the real reason to come here is the staff.  Not only are they beautiful they're genuinely kind.  Alisha and Melissa have been amazing each time I've visited.    Don't forget to yell out "Big Unit" when the bell sounds.

I was right, coming back more has made this place grow on me. The hurricanes are so much better than they were before and the food is amazing. The staff is all great and I've become friends with several of them.   Try the jackfruit fries, O.M.G.

Thank you so much Nader for telling me about this great place.  As I mentioned in my Pie Hole review I have a list of foods I wanted to find so I could be happy living down town.  Udon was second on that list behind pie.  I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon and some random sushi roll.  The sushi wasn't memorable, the rice was a little crisper than I care for in a sushi roll.  The Udon was amazing however.  Usually when I order Udon I can't finish the whole bowl, it's always so much food.  The Nabeyaki was so good I happily enjoyed the pain from over eating.    Thanks to Cherry Blossom and the Pie Hole my list of foods I need to stay happily downtown is complete.

I loved all the furniture here.    I didn't feel pressured at any point and everyone was very polite.  While I didn't buy anything today there is a strong chance I'll be going back here often in the future.

I try really hard to avoid coming into this store.  Everything displayed makes me want to just give them my paycheck.  Sadly my need for food and sleep prevents me from giving them every dollar I make.  I'm happy to see Apple making a come back.  I went to college for Graphic Design and the majority of my classes where on Macs.  I had to transition to PC for my new career and having a Mac at home helps keep me sane.  They really do "just work".

This place was for me the perfect example of why I love Yelp.  It wasn't that long ago that it was almost impossible to find places like this when you're visiting.  Being in a tourist trap like Vegas made it all that much harder.    Coffee Pub is close enough to the casinos that it's easy to get to if you happen to be staying at one but far enough still that the prices aren't crazy.  I loved the vibe this place had.  Walking in I felt like I had found some secret place only locals would know about.  Being that it's in the back of an outdoor mall with no obvious signage from the street I may not be that far off.  The staff was very helpful and friendly but not in that fake way you get used to when you spend a lot of time in the casinos.  The menu had lots of great choices that made me wish it wasn't a 4 hour drive away from home so I could try them all.    I'm not normally a coffee drinker but I figured if I'm trying out a place named Coffee Pub I had to try some.  It was very good and I could see myself drinking more of it if I lived closer.  I'll be sure to eat here every time I find myself in Vegas.

Being that this is the closest place to where I live I decided to give them a call and see if they had the liquor I required for my most recent concoction.  I was told they had everything I needed and I thanked them.  Having never been here before I didn't know what to expect when I first arrived.  At first it did catch me a little off guard since I had become accustomed to the bigger chain stores.  I was happy to see a great selection when I walked in and was warmly greeted.   I took a moment to look around to see if I could find everything I needed but wasn't having much luck so I asked the cashier for assistance.  As it turns out he had pulled everything I asked for and it was waiting for me at the register.    It's a very comfortable place, the people are genuine and the service is great because they actually want you to have a good experience.

Let me start off by stating I am extremely picky when it comes to Italian food.  Lucky for them I didn't actually see any on their menu.  Sure it had names that could fool one into thinking they served some Italian style dishes what was brought to our table proved that to be a false belief.    If you're looking for a place to have a drink while sitting in each others laps then this is the place for you.

I believe the habanero burger has destroyed my ability to detect heat and I love it. I come back as often as I can to pay for the privilege to have my tastebuds killed by this delicious burger.

Today was my fourth visit to Green, I've tried something new each time.  I continue to be surprised how delicious vegan food can be.  The mock chicken is surprisingly good and I can't believe how good the doughboy is.   I plan on trying everything on their menu.

This place is almost as bad for me as The Apple Store.   The friendliest of staff, a great selection and some of the best prices I've seen.  As long as I'm pretending to be a photographer I'll keep coming back to this awesome store.

Where do I start....  So we book a room to Circus Circus from one of those discount websites.  It was a great deal, half price and close to everything we wanted to visit.  We get to the hotel and once we find our way to guest registration we are greeted by someone who clearly was at the end very long shift and wasn't at all pleased with the idea of checking anyone else in.  She very unceremoniously informs us that the room we booked wasn't available and we will be placed in another room.  No apology, no compensation.  When we asked if there was another available room that we could perhaps pay to upgrade to she simply said "No".  I also found it a little unsettling that there was a resort fee on top of what we had already paid online.  It was nice to hear that this resort fee did come with access to their wifi.    I try to not let my experience at guest registration ruin my trip so I head to our room, which mind you is literally as far away from guest registration as you could get and still be considered Circus Circus.  Our room was in the very back of their property in what I'm guessing is one of the original buildings from when Circus Circus was built.  If the decor was any indicator it was some time in the 60s, probably the last time our room saw any real attention.    We settle into the room and I attempt to connect to the wifi I was told about at the front desk.  The one thing I'm thinking is probably the only thing I'll get of use out of this resort fee I paid.   To my surprise I find that there is no available wifi.     None of this was all that terrible really, it was a cheap price and really how much time do you want to spend in your hotel when you're in Las Vegas?  The real problem came with the paper thin walls.  I could hear people in the adjoining rooms as if they were in my room with me.  Being Las Vegas no one sleeps, ever, so clearly I was a fool to think I should expect any sleep.    In the end it was all too much for me and my trip was cut short.  After driving for nearly 5 hours and getting almost no sleep I opted to drive home.

I'll try anything twice, that's always been my motto.  While the staff is very kind there is a hint of disdain.  Perhaps it was my "Bearded for her pleasure" shirt.  I actually enjoyed everything about this restaurant, except for the food, atmosphere and service.

My food was very good.  I can't say the same about my service.  No silverware, no water, a couple of mishaps on orders.  Our group felt ignored most of the night.  I've heard a lot of good things about this place so I'm sure I'll give it another try.  After I've run out of new places to try first...

I have yet to have a bad experience here.  Oh wait, I was here once while ill, but I can't blame that on them.  Each time I come I try something different and I've not been disappointed yet.  Their Feta Rosa is excellent.  The live music is always great and the servers are cheerful and cute.  I've worn my "bearded for her pleasure" shirt here and I think it actually got me better service!

You can not beat the prices of Shady's.  They're so low I'm sure the it somehow correlates to their name.  I think I need to readjust my definition of a dive bar.  I had heard this was little bit of a dive bar but I didn't see it.  It's very cozy and a great lounge bar.  I'll be going back again for sure.

IKEA has the potential to make me believe in a higher power.  Not for the reasons you may think however.  If you believe in a higher power you must also believe in his counterpart and IKEA's store is proof he exists.    Don't get me wrong I love a lot of the items they sell and I'm happy that I can get them without having to pay shipping.  But the layout of the store is beyond irritating.  They force you to look at every item in the store just to get to the part you want to, everyone walks at a ridiculously slow pace completely ignorant of your desire to walk faster.  And the check out lines are so slow.   I'm bet Walmart goes there to learn how to slow people down even more.   It's highly likely I'll be back here, begrudgingly.

Places like this are why I love living downtown.  The food is great and the staff friendly.  I really like the seating and how it can help bring people together that may not otherwise meet.    If the food and atmosphere aren't enough you can also come back on Friday for the food trucks or saturday morning for the market.

I've only been here at night so far, and last night was only my second time. It's a great small town bar, everyone knows each other and they are all very friendly. If you find yourself in Maricopa at night and you're looking for the night scene this is it.

Pros: Lots of great choices for shopping,  Cons: The parking is terrible.  Even though there are other locations for a lot of the stores located here that are closer to my place I enjoy being able to get it all out of the way in one location.

I had a surprisingly good visit to Best Buy last night.  The staff was polite and while I walked around the store last night I had several as me if I needed help finding anything.    I wanted a sound bar for my TV, one that can easily mount on the wall, but I enjoy walking around the store and checking out the other gadgets.  When I finally made my way to the sound bars I was offered help very quickly.  The sales associate was very friendly and knowledgeable without being in the least bit pushy.  He could see my interest where more in the mid-price range and didn't try to talk me into spending more than I wanted to.  After I decided what I wanted he helped check me out and wasn't pushy when I rejected the extended maintenance.  The Tempe Market Place location is easily my favorite of the Best Buys I've visited in Arizona.

I've been getting my hair cut here for over a year now and I plan on continuing to go back.  Rene is great at what she does and always makes me feel welcome.  I really feel like she takes the time to make sure I get a good hair cut.    The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of work provided.  I really hope Rene doesn't go anywhere any time soon!

I've been using Danny's for a few years now and I'm more then a little sad at my experience today.    I went during my lunch break hoping to have a short line, which thankfully I did.  I apparently wasn't the only one who had this idea however and quite a few people showed up behind me.  I walk out to wait for my car after paying to find it was break time, watching a couple of the guys walk away conveniently right before the influx of cars.  25 minutes later my car finally rolls out to the drying area.  I'm hoping the long wait before my car made it out to be dried meant special attention was being paid for the VIP carwash I had paid for.  Sadly this was not the case.  It appeared a vacuum hadn't even made it to the passenger side of my car nor had they bothered to throw away some of the trash that was on that side of the car.  This wan't the only thing that was missed.  It was clear that several sections of my dash hadn't been touched either.  I've had a bad experience at some of the other locations over the years but never this one before today.  I think I'm going to just wash it myself from now on...

We did the worst thing you can ever do to a waiter.  Ever.  We showed up 30 minutes before happy hour and some of our group, who shall remain nameless, wanted to wait until happy hour started before anything was ordered.  At first the waiter was visibly upset by this but he soon warmed up to us and never for a moment gave us anything by amazing service.  Perhaps because it was his birthday he was in such a good mood he decided to cut us some underserved slack.  I enjoyed a bottle of wine with friends which is something I don't usually enjoy.  I shared some olives and a pizza as well.   The pizza was amazing but honestly the olives stole the show.  They are warm and for $5 you get so many it's easily a meal.    I will almost almost assuredly go back for, if nothing else, those olives.

I was blown away by the Ahi burger.    As a Pescabacatarian (fish, veggies, bacon) I didn't think I would find anything here to eat.  When i saw the Ahi on the menu I decided to give it a try.  It was perfectly cooked, the bun was great and it wasn't heavy or too filling.  I've heard good things about the fries and shakes so I'll be going back for sure.

The food is amazing, especially anything on their pretzel buns.  The staff is all very friendly and dangerously close to too good looking.  Most places I frequent I end up finding one dish they make that I just stick to.  I can't do that here, with the exception of the Shrimp BLT I have loved everything I've tried and can't pick a favorite.    Try anything on a pretzel bun, you won't be disappointed.

After more than 18 years of debating what I wanted to get permanently scared into my skin I finally selected Apryl at 27 Tattoo Studio.  Most of those 18 years had been spent trying to find the perfect tattoo, one with deep meaning.  I found that I could never find an artist that could match my high standards for these lofty ideas I had for my first tattoo.  After a dramatic shift in paradigm I decided to select an artist I liked and forgo the idea of a deeply meaningful tattoo.   I actually found Apryl here on Yelp and saw some photos of her work and was blown away.  Her color work and shading are amazing and now that I've had my first session I was amazed at her skill. The detail in her lines, the great shading and how clean her work was over all has left me wanting more.  I can't wait for my second session to finish up this tattoo and I'm positive I'll be going back to Apryl again and again for future tattoos.

I don't feel I can review the service properly because I have friends who work here.  But the food and drinks are fair game.  I tried the Salmon Hash and the Red Velvet Pancakes. Both where very good.  I do prefer my salmon a little less well done than they are in the hash but I understand it would be difficult considering the way it must have been prepared.  The Red Velvet pancakes where a little rich for my taste but still very good.  After moving out of Scottsdale I try not to venture back too often but friends and places like the Herb Box will keep me going back for awhile.

It was an uncommonly rainy night when I met a friend here for dinner and drinks so the patio area was closed.  I was sad that I couldn't enjoy the patio because it was honestly the one thing that really drew me in from the photos I saw here from other yelpers.  The interior was as packed as a small place this could be.  At this point I'm a little unsure about staying, no patio and tight quarters.   The staff was immediately very happy to see me and showed no signs they were at all put out by the weather.    I ordred a beer and the pizza of the day.  The waitress tried to tell me what was on the pizza of the day but I really wanted to be surprised so I asked her to stop.  All she got out was "it's called black and blue".  I was told the beer I wanted wasn't in stock or going to be carried anymore so I said surprise me with a random beer that is similar.  They brought me one of my favorites so I was very happy with their choice.  The pizza took a lot longer to come out than I would have expected but I really didn't mind.  The atmosphere was so comfortable that had I not looked at the time I wouldn't have realized so much of it had passed.    The pizza was great, I had fun figuring out why they called it Black and Blue and the waitress asked me if I had figured it out.  The blue cheese flavor wasn't overpowering nor was the blackened steak.  It was a very well balanced flavor over all and I enjoyed every bite.  I'm sure I'll be back so I can explore more of their menu and hopefully try out the patio area.

I've been here a few times now, usually after eating at Windsor or Federal Pizza and have enjoyed it every time.  Where else can you get some of the best rocky road I've ever had and a wax mustache?  I'm sure as the weather warms I'll be visiting this place more and more often.

I recently cheated on my pescabacontarianism (veggies, fish and bacon) diet to enjoy a burger while at a recent outing to a baseball game.   I was excited to see something other than your standard hot dogs and nachos while walking around trying to find something to eat.  The excitement quickly faded once I was told the price for two combo meals.  Thankfully I had recently sold one of my kidneys on the black market so I was able to scrape together just enough to pay for the meals.  Hunger is indeed the best spice, the burger and fries went down without much of a fight.  Sadly since I have only one remaining kidney the odds are I won't be able to eat here again, unless I win the power ball of course.

Crescent is one of my favorite venues in the Phoenix area.  They host a large variety of shows and the staff is all very friendly.  They've recently expanded out the patio areas and it's helped a great deal in alleviating the cramped feeling you could get.    The only negative thing I can really say about this place is the bathroom situation.  Make sure to stand in line for a bathroom before you need to go.

I have this friend who loves meat.  I mean LOVES meat.  I convince her to meet me here for a meal and being the brave soul she is she gives it a try.  Now I've been here before and I know the food here is good but she's a skeptic.  She orders a burger and fries and the look on her face when she took that first bite said it all.  She was blown away how good vegetarian food can taste.  If you like good food don't let the vegetarian scare you away.  Every item I've tried on the menu is amazing.

I really don't think I'm the target audience for a place like this.  I understand what they're going for with these artisan pizzas but I really would just like a little sauce on my pizza.  Just a little...  The flavors are usually good but the lack of any sauce and more often than not over cooked dough make it hard for me to want to keep coming back to places like this.

I'm afraid I'm turning into that old guy who finds a style of shoes he likes as a teen and never stops wearing them.  Thankfully Vans don't seem to go out of style and they do add some new flavors in from time to time so I may be okay.  I've been to Vans stores in many states and the one in Scottsdale Fashion Square is my favorite.  I never feel like I'm looked down on because I'm not some teen or hipster (I'm not a hipster!).    It never seems to matter how much you're spending here to get great service.  Even before I walked out with my five new pairs of shoes they treated me like I was going to buy five new pair.    This reminds me, is there some sort of 12 step for shoe addiction?

I love Songbird, like "will you marry me" love.  It reminds me of some of my favorite coffee places back in Boulder CO.  It is the type of place you can just get the beverage of your choice, maybe a snack and hang out.  I enjoyed that you can sit and have a conversation with someone without feeling like you're interrupting everyones work.  Songbird is active in the community as well.  They sponsored our Neighborhood for nextdoor.com and have been active in helping it grow.  Make sure you try the Thai Tea, it's so good.

My first visit here was for a Yelp event and I enjoyed myself quite a bit.  I was late so I missed out on a good amount of the food but what I was able to sample was very tasty.    I came back a second time for a birthday party and was less impressed.  The upstairs bar was over crowded.  My food order was messed up and at the end they messed up my bill as well.    Because some of my friends seem to like this place I'm sure I'll end up back here in the future.  Perhaps my impression will improve and I'll update my review.

There's just something about this whole part of town I enjoy.  I haven't had any food in the area that I haven't liked yet.  I was invited here by some friends and was blown away by the choices.  The crust was perfect, the service was quick and their beer selection, while small, was great.  I look forward to many more visits in the future.

A friend invited me here to talk shop and discuss a future collaboration.  From the street this place wasn't easy to find.  It gelt like one of those secret little places that only locals know about.  Once you find the building it's not too difficult to find thankfully.   It's a very interesting place, coffee during the day, wine during the night.  I can't say I've been to a place like this before.  The only negative comment I can really say about my visit was the new employee they left alone to tend bar.  He handled it well but you could tell he really didn't know enough to be alone at this point.  At one point a patron asked for a vodka tonic and he had to offer her wine or beer because he had never heard of a vodka tonic before.  The beer was beer, not much to say about that.  Keep it cold and don't serve it all foamy and I"m good.  The food was pretty good however.  I had a flatbread with some salmon and enjoyed it thoroughly.

I enjoyed everything about Squid Ink.  The decor was unique, the staff was very kind and the menu full of choices.  I ordered the daily special, Fire Breathing Dragon, and one of the sushi dinners.  It came with a sample of many of their sushi all of which I enjoyed.  I have no doubt I will become a regular, once I can find more friends who enjoy sushi...

Oh dear lord this place is good.  I go to the turf more often than I'd care to admit and I've always wondered what the food here was like.  I'm really picky when it comes to pizza or italian food as most places tend to put way too much sugar in their marinara.    A friend and I wanted to try some place neither of us had been and I'd heard good things about this place from some friends so I decided to give it a try.  We ordered a salad, pizza and a couple drinks.  We were both blown away with not only the service but the food as well.    There are a couple of artisan pizza places not that far from Pomo that get a lot of attention but I'm honestly not a fan.  Pomo is hands down my favorite pizza place in AZ.

I pretty sure I had a good time here.  I can't say I'm positive because of the beer I had.  Thankfully I took a picture of the menu so I know what beer to blame, or thank, for this night I no longer remember.  Shmaltz He'Brew Jew Reborn at an ABV% of 17.0.  I do remember really liking the table I had, a great view of the sunset and I had an awesome burger, the Ivan.  Once I made it halfway though the beer though the night fades away in my memory.   I'll have to go back to verify I did like this place, and maybe take more notes or something while I try the Reborn again.

Are you a fan of delicious flavor?  Do you enjoy ahi tuna?  How about Wasabi chips, do you like those?  If yes you must try the Ahi burger, it's hands down the single best food item I've ever eaten.  Ever.  If you are one of those strange people who didn't answer yes they also have some good hamburgers.  If you're into that sort of thing.  Seriously though this place is amazing.  They have so many great options that even a vegetarian can enjoy a meal.

I've had gourmet  hotdogs from a few places over the years.  They all fall short after having Short Leash.    I had the Devil Dog with some added bacon, Becca had the Bear and my friends had some build your own types.  The table was completely quiet after our food arrived.  All of us focused on our meals.    One of my friends that joined us spent the rest of his weekend telling everyone he could about the most amazing hotdog he'd ever had in his life.

Since moving downtown I've had a list of foods I needed to find to be happy down here.  Pie was on the top of that list.  When I first moved downtown there wasn't a good pie place close but I continued my search.  Trying it when I would find it on a dessert menu at every place I could find it.  Sadly it wasn't very many places and the closest I could get to a decent pie was frozen cheesecake.    After Short Leash opened I went to try them out and was told about The Pie Hole.  I was hopeful they would have good pie but I was apprehensive to get too excited.  I tried one of the couple of pies that Short Leash offers from The Pie Hole and was told to enjoy a larger variety of pie I would have to go to The Pie Hole myself.  I made a point to come back later just for the pie.  I had the banana cream pie and was blown away.  Unlike most pies they didn't over sweeten the pie or the crust.  It reminded me so much of the pies that my family would make growing up.  It was perfect.    I'm a fan for sure and will be going back as often as I can, hopefully I won't need to let out any clothes due to my love for pie.

What a great first experience!    I ordered the pizza From Brussels with Love sans the bacon.  The only bad thing about this visit was the server either didn't hear me or forgot to ask to have the bacon removed but she fixed it quickly and with a smile so I really didn't mind.  Service was excellent, the pizza was amazing and I fell in love with the high back leather chairs.  I will be coming back here often.

My first elite event where I wasn't a +1 and I had a great time!    It was very cool to meet so many new people, try some new food and drink and visit a place I normally wouldn't go to.  I tend to avoid nation chain restaurants so it was nice to get to try out things I would have otherwise missed with friends, new and old.  The new happy hour menu was tasty and I appreciate the prices.  My favorite was the coconut shrimp by far.  These were not small shrimp.  I look forward to many more events in the future and expanding my horizons at places I normally wouldn't think to try out.

I should have known from the beginning it wasn't going to be a good experience.    I eat out enough to know the customary greeting a server offers is typically a short greeting followed by a drink order.  What I was offered was a question if I had any groupons or other types of discounts.  I did happen to purchase a $10 for $5 here from Yelp she tells me "I thought we discontinued that, hmmm".  Not a great way to start.  When my friend asked if it was possible to order happy hour she said in a very snooty way there was no way to mix the coupon and happy hour prices.  Not even if we split the check.  I don't have a problem with that, it was the way she felt she needed to inform us.  She started to walk away while we figured out what we wanted, again still not asking if we wanted anything to drink.  I had to ask if she could get our drink orders.  At this point I knew I didn't want to have a meal here but I didn't want to waste my $5 I had spent on Yelp for this place so I ordered an appetizer to split with my friend.  It was very good but not worth ever visiting again.  Had that been the worst of it this review would be much different.  The remainder of our visit we were ignored for large portions of time and received more attitude each time she did decide to stop by.  It was understaffed and I'm sure this is why she wasn't in the best of moods but that doesn't excuse taking it out on the customers.

Between the lowest prices I've found locally and the very warm and welcoming staff I was very happy to have found this place when I needed several pants altered.  The mother & daughter team give you a very welcoming friendly feeling from the moment you step inside.  The alterations I requested were done perfectly and on time.  They even were able to fix some pants I loved that had a tare on them near the label.  Since pants seldom come in my size I'll very likely become a regular.

Blown away, completely blown away.  The hours are perfect if you're a night owl, the pizza is, as I'm told from a New Yorker, New York style pizza.  We had tried a lot of other pizza joints together and while they were all great this one took us completely by surprise on how good it is.    It's ready very fast even if you order something special.  The staff was very friendly and engaging.  If you're in the area late at night and need a bite you would be doing yourself a disservice to not give this place a chance.

I'm the luckiest man alive!    They played one of my favorite movies of all times Wayne's World.  Even though I had watched it just a couple weeks ago it was cool seeing it on the big screen again.    The event was also very cool, a great way to experience Film Bar if you'd never been before or if like me you'd never watched a movie there.    I can't wait to see what the next movie in this series is!

I swear each event is better than the last and this is hands down my favorite yet.  Not only was the wine and food amazing but learning about how and why they chose them.  I'm slowly warming up to wine and events like this have been helping me learn more so I can enjoy them more.  Oh, and the drawing at the end was awesome ;) I will without a doubt be going back now.

I will be updating this review in 30 days once I've decided to keep the mattress.  This is to date my best shopping experience ever.  Phil was very informative without being pushy.  Once I decided to purchase a mattress I was told the amount included tax and was happy to find that not only could I leave with my purchase but also that it fit into the backseat of a car without issue.    I'll never buy a mattress the traditional way again.

Now that I've been sleeping on the mattress a few months I wanted to update my review.  This mattress is probably one of the best I've slept on.  I'm always telling people how much I love my mattress, the shopping experience and I've even had friends lie down to see how amazing it is.    The shopping experience remains one of the best I've had.

Fez is one of my favorite locations in the art district.  When they moved to Central and Roosevelt about a year and a half ago I quickly became a regular.  The food is great, the staff is amazing and the central location is idea for starting or ending your night.  Sometimes in my case both.  The food is great, the staff is amazing and surprisingly stable for a restaurant.  The low turnover shows how great of a place it is and makes it easy for you to build a relationship with them if you're regular.
