They don't honor coupons from "Coupon Clipper" app.  They require the coupon to be printed. Not cool. I won't be back.

I love this place!  I'm a creature of habit so I can only speak on a few different menu items.  I always order a bean and potato burro (hold the cheese) and a bean tostada (again, hold the cheese).  If I'm getting the order To-Go I always order extra hot sauce on the side.  Neither of the items come with hot sauce.  Sometimes, I order a package of tortilla's to take home.  Anyway, I've been there enough times to say that I really love it.  The employee's are ALWAYS nice and always seem to be doing their particular responsibility well.  Nine times out of Ten, the place is packed... so be prepared.  Also, they are not open on Sundays and are closed on holidays and sometimes a day or two before and after holidays.
