The place was busy the night we went and the service was terrible. They broke my cardinal rule of service and served others  behind us in line first, plus the food was average.

I have been going to Tribal since June of 2014. When I started I had already lost about 80 lbs by working out 5x a week and changing my diet but I was just not getting the results I wanted at A typical gym and the standard workout of alternating muscle groups. Now a year later I have seen amazing results. I have lost another 20 lbs but have added significant muscle mass. I am able to do almost all movements and have seen major changes. The couches are great and do an excellent job encouraging all participants while making sure they do the movements safely. I'm looking forward to another year in the tribe.
