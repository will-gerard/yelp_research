BEST Mexican food restaurant this side of the Mississippi and this side of the border!!! If I could rate this 100 out of 5 stars I would!

Overpriced pizza and wine with unsatisfactory quality. Would never recommend this place to a friend. The only reason this has two stars is for the ambiance.

They have the best Pad Thai I have ever had. I have grown up in the valley only going to the pricey Mailees on Maine for Thai food. Last night we randomly decided to check out Thai Basil and it has blown Mailees out of the water with their great prices and taste. I'm addicted and will be returning... A lot.

Slow service (poured our own water/went to bartender for requirements). Undercooked fatty steak in the tacos that primarily tasted burnt. Rock hard "chips" and a weak excuse for salsa. Went with a party of 4 and none of us enjoyed our meals - salads, carne asada tacos and chicken quesadilla.

$30 gel mani - there are a couple people here that do a horrible job, be sure to ask friends for suggestions for a good person so your gel manicure lasts and your nails are filed evenly
