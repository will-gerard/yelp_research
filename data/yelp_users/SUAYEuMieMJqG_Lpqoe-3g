I read the Yelp reviews online and decided to give them a try. I was very impressed by their professionalism. My car was delivered as promised and they kept me informed the entire time. I highly recommend them! You can't even tell I had work done!! Whoot Whoot!!!

This was my first time here. The service was poor and the food tasted even worse. I ate the white rice and that was it. Dumped the rest....save your 8 bucks and walk to the Irish Pub down the street!

We go to this location many times but recently the portion size has drastically diminished. My husband and I ordered two burittos. One with sofrita and the other with steak. The gal gave us a 1/4 of a spoon of sofrita and said if I wanted more, we'd have to pay for double the sofrita. When asked about the sample size portion, we were told it was 2 ounces and that was the protein requirement. We had to double the steak for my husband too! Not going back to this location again.  If you need a children's size burrito then this is the spot for you!!!

I wouldn't go anywhere else now!!! Matt and his team were incredibly friendly, professional and flexible. The quality of their work is stellar. Matt wrapped our Z06 fenders in a matte clear bra since we have a pearl matte paint. We couldn't be more happy with the results. He even went above and beyond and added small pieces of matte wrap in areas where the pattern didn't cover. The shop is super clean too  Stop shopping around....they are IT!!
