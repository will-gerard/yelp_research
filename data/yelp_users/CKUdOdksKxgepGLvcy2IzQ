I have very curly unmanageable hair and Ali always seems to know just what to do with it. I am very apprehensive to let anyone touch my hair but she has yet to disappoint me. She is always trying something new while keeping my best interest in mind. Ramon's salon is a pleasure to go to and I won't go anywhere else!

This place is so charming and unlike any other. It's like being in a romantic candle lit wine cellar with great live music. The staff is wonderful- Milynn & Taylor especially. So pleasant, helpful and knowledgable. The drink and wine selection is impressive but the food is not to be overlooked. The cheeses, duck tacos and flatbreads are amazing and they serve really late which is awesome. Love love coming here, such a refreshing place in the middle of old town

Just want to alert the manager to let their employees know that it is ILLEGAL to refuse water to someone in Arizona. Popped in here during an evening walk last night really needing a cup of water. The employee (man with some kind of braid ponytail) was extremely rude and after I told him it was illegal he said it's because they don't have cups. I am not a homeless person, I wasn't intoxicated or disturbing the peace. I live very close by and it would be wise for a business to extend courtesy to local residents, you never know what business you're going to lose.

Mostly disappointed. I'm from New York and no stranger to fresh seafood. I understand we're in Arizona and flown in is about as fresh as you can get. Be warned not EVERYTHING is flown in daily. Only one page of the menu is. My boyfriend and I shared frog legs, crab Mac n cheese and the Chilean sea bass. I will say the Mac n cheese was freaking delicious but I tasted very little crab. The frogs legs were the saddest of the 3. Just plain fried like the heap of French fries it comes with. No finesse or seasoning. A lot of their menu is just fried seafood. The sea bass was ok. I don't think they treated the fish amazingly and the toppings/accompaniments are lackluster. Overall nothing was really elevated or screamed fresh seafood. For the price and drive I will not be going back there. Check out little cleos for a much more exciting seafood experience.

SO MUCH NOM. Their burgers are hard to beat. They are extremely similar in flavor to in-n-out but with just a little more finesse in preparation. I get mine on a gluten free bun which is better than any other gf bun I've ever had on a burger. It's soft, toasted really nicely and with all the delicious ingredients in between I almost forget it's even gluten free. I've gotta say I'm not crazy about the tacos but I crave these burgers constantly. It's a rare gem to find a drive through place with such high quality ingredients and really decent prices. I've never had any issues with customer service, everyone I've dealt with has been extremely pleasant. Any one who hates on their burgers is delusional.  If you're feeling naughty get the dulce de leche shake, it's ridiculously good.

Pretty exceptional quiche. My boyfriend picked it up to go so I didn't get to see the inside of this place but the food was very yummy. Got a perfectly sized quiche with super flaky delicious crust. Maybe slightly too oniony for me but I would definitely eat it again. It also comes with the best fruit cup I've ever gotten. Ate the whole thing. Can't wait to try more things on their menu.

Our server Charlie was great! Soo informative about the menu and on top of everything. Great relaxing atmosphere and not ridiculously priced. Only problem is parking, like anywhere in old town. Definitely worth checking out!
