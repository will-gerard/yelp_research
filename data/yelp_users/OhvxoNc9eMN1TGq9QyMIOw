This is the SLOWEST drive-thru ever. I waited for 25 minutes with two cars in front of me...what ever happened to "please pull into a parking space and we'll bring it out to you" to avoid holding up the whole line? Cashier apologized, asked me if I wanted sauce and offered free chocolate pastry. Guess what? No sauce and no chocolate pastry to be found in my bag. Seriously, if I ever want fast food in my area again I'll just drive the extra mile to Sonic.

Ok...so yeah is some of the clientele obnoxious, yeah sure...but the bartenders are FAB-U-LOUS! Lindsey and Ron are THE BEST IN TOWN and the drinks are cheap. Ask for the "money shot" lol

Here's the deal....the manicures and pedicures are fantastic and the techs are awesome BUT the last two times I've been there they've told me I'm next to keep me there and end up soaking me for over an HOUR instead of service. The last time I straight up asked for a towel to dry my feet and walked out after an hour and a half wait. I understand wanting to keep business, but when a customer says they have limited time to get in and out don't LIE to them to keep them there. There are thousands of nail salons to visit...I'd skip this one just because of the experience.

Love the pizza and great beer flights. Ask for Kim as a server in the bar area, she's the best!

Very clean, fast service, friendly staff. Would be 5 stars but they were out of what I ordered.

If you love Thai food you will LOVE this place. Located in a run down strip mall just the appearance alone might be enough to have you running for the hills....but go ahead and park, the food will more than make up for the outside aesthetic. Once inside you're welcomed by a warm and inviting atmosphere filled with carved wood panels and silk table covers. We tried the yellow curry shrimp and hot and spicy beef and noodles (hot is HOT!). Worth a trip, they just made it to the top of our list of favorites in the neighborhood.

GET HERE NOW...NOW!!! Great food! It will look like there is no seating when you're in line on the weekend, but by the time you get your food it will be open TRUST ME. Try the Mexican benedict...life changing. Cinnamon rolls? Fogettaboutit!

I swear this is THE BEST vape shop in town. Steve the owner is so helpful, you can try any flavor in store, and with 5 for $35 you can't beat the price. High quality liquid!!

This place is addicting. My favorite is the Bahama mama with B12 and the jerk chicken wrap. Friendly staff, great prices, delicious.

This is seriously a diamond in the rough! Situated in the old Submarino's suite on the NW corner of 51st Ave and Northern it's hidden away. My family and I have been to Tacos Mich at least twice a week since we found it. Try the ceviche tostadas and grab a michelada beer. Everything we've tried there has been delicious! Not going to lie though...I agree with a few of the other yelpers that the service isn't always the best, but it is a fast food type setting. Give it a shot.

It's just as good as everyone else says...would make any red blooded American slap their own mama good. You can't go wrong with any of the sauces or rubs! Prices are decent and the staff inside were all so nice and welcoming. Will be back!
