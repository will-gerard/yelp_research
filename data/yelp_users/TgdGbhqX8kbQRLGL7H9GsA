Love the new location! I love the girls that work there...they are all so nice and helpful. Love the product they sell there, as well as their monthly deals and/or incentives

Marcee Walker is such an amazing trainer! I loved her classes and really miss her and UFC. I wish she taught more classes as i could not make the 5am any more. She changed my body, is very knowledgeable, and gives you a one on one training feel in a group class.

If I could give a half a star I would. The service here is absolutely terrible to the point it's a joke. Do they even have servers working here???? This place could be great but it's not; flat our terrible, over priced, and just bad

I have had the same person do my brows for years and was beyond nervous to try someone new..but I am beyond happy that I did! Amanda is amazing and does such a great job. Every time I leave I feel like my face is completely transformed and I feel great. She is my go to girl and I would highly recommend her for all waxing and aesthetic needs. She's not only a highly talented professional but is very accommodating and really provides optimal customer service. I was in a jam and about to go on a trip and she made it work; I couldn't be more grateful.
