Rude customer service! We sit and wait for someone to acknowledge us. Fifteen minutes go by and I finally ask for a server as no one was coming to our table. They bring our drinks and get our order taken care of. The soup arrives after the main meal because the server forgot about it. The hash browns which are part of the meal never arrive and as we inquire about it the server looks surprised "Do you want hash browns?" duh! It comes with the meal.... We didn't have enough silver wear. Our drinks never got refilled and by the time I got the creamer for my coffee was cold. Then the server has the balls to say "Everyone happy?" With an attitude. Bad experience! Nick, you need to have a more friendly tone. It's thanksgiving day, be grateful for having a job.

Extremely bad customer service! All the employees are rude including the manager. My friend and I went looking for Halloween costumes and asked for help from one of the employees. He said "I'm currently helping a customer I will be right with you" we waited for him to become available for 30 minutes while he continued to help others that arrived after us. We asked to speak to the manager because we kept been ignored then he asked "Is there something wrong?" My friend responded "Obviously you haven't helped us" his response was "I obviously haven't" then walked away and he rolled his eyes. The manager came and spoke to us and apologized but you could tell she didn't care. When we checked out the cashier didn't greet us, all he said was "By the way you can't return this." And threw the items in the bag. Their store is super trashy! Never going back to this store. Their region manager should pay them a visit some time soon.

Updated Review:::: I gave this place a second chance! After being over my previous experience I visited them five times. All the other times I attended were great! Management must of done something to fix the issues. They were clean at all times, all the people were friendly, we received our food in time, no hassle. I hope this continues to be the case going forward and I shall continue to return.   Awful customer service! Why is there a Gratitude included in the bill? I would have left $0.00 as a tip. My friends and I came to enjoy great food and drinks needless to say nothing about the experience was great not even the drinks. We came in 8pm an hour went by and I still hadn't gotten my food so I asked the waiter what was going on? Obviously he had forgotten about it. It wasn't until 9:30 that I received my food and I got to speak with the manager. Thanks for taking care of my appetizer I would have given you two stars, but everyone else got charged extra for food and drinks. Their bathrooms were disgusting and no pens to sign off my tab with????? Seriously never coming back again!!!

I ordered enchiladas and the tortillas were really cold. My server nicely offered to bring me another plate and I thought "perfect". When I received the second plate however, the food burned my mouth. I did not enjoy my food at all! It looked like they just brought it out of the freezer and put it in the microwave. The location is super sketchy too.

Baristas here are rude! Try to avoid this Starbucks as much as possible. When my dad ordered his drink with his accent the barista (Hanna) at the drive through made fun of him! How insulting. When it was my turn to place my order I made sure to share with Hanna a couple of customer service tips. She was so embarrassed she had someone else give us our drinks. I wish I would have had the chance to talk to the manager about her behavior, but honestly I had more important things to do. Also, on Sunday when I went through the drive through they quickly told me what my total was without asking if there was anything else that I needed. "I am not done yet! " and then the guy laughed. Apparently everything you tell them is a joke. Also, last month they were out of venti cups..... I personally love Starbucks, but when it comes to customer service one bad experience it's all it takes to  lose the loyalty.

I've been a customer for a couple of years. Their customer service is great! You can bring whatever design and they will do it. Don't have the color you are looking for? They will mix it for you. They really try to accommodate their customers however possible. Tiffany and Tish are fabulous!

Can't stop, won't stop eating at JK Sushi! Let's just say I detested sushi for the longest time ever until I tried this sushi. I've been going here for 4+ years and it's always a nice experience to see the owner of the restaurant, the chef make the sushi. They already know me by name which is advantageous because I get free dessert every now and then ;))) Speaking of desserts if you check it out make sure you try their green tea ice cream :) yummy, yummy, yummy in my tummy. Their menu keeps growing! The recently added alcoholic drinks to their menu, HELLO A+ to that! Them Spicy California rolls are only ~$4.00 and they are glorious! nothing fancy, nothing complicated just something delish enough to satisfy that tummy. Highly recommended! It's nice to go eat somewhere were you are always greeted with a happy attitude. Like previous reviews have mentioned don't be fooled by the appearance, is the food that takes the experience to a whole different level. As I am writing this review I can't stop thinking about their sushi, too bad they close in 30 mins or else I would go her a roll. Just THE BOMB.COM!!!!

I am shocked that I am barely writing this review for Wildflower Bread Company since I eat here at least twice a week. I used to be obsessed with Paradise Bakery but then I met Wildflower and so I dumped them. The reason? Their ingredients! So fresh, so delicious! I've literally had everything on their menu and there is nothing that I wouldn't recommend. Isn't that hard to admit when it's  not your mom's food you are having? Well anyways, another thing I love about Wildflower is that they are always giving back to the community. A few months ago they were running a campaign on Instagram all you had to do was upload a picture of you to share a good deed you've done in your community. I uploaded one and had the most likes, not only did I get $100 dollar gift card but they also gave $100 dollars to a charity of my choice! I absolutely have a great experience every time I go here from the moment when I step a foot in the building to the moment I walk out. Their atmosphere is comfortable and clean at all times! I like the fact that the manager is always helping the team serve the food and ensuring everything is ok with the customers. They are just amazing! Thank you Wildflower for always being fantastic not only with your customers, but with your community as well. I will continue to come for as long as I live because not only you feel my tummy, but you fill my heart with happiness :)

Best casino in AZ!!! The atmosphere is very diverse and upbeat. They basically have all you need for a weekend full of fun. Multiple gambling rooms, a nightclub, gift shopping boutique, restaurants, beautiful pool, hotel accommodation,valet parking, bars, bars and more bars. It's like a mini Vegas!!! Everyone is super nice and full of energy. Every now and then they will have live music. I absolutely love this casino and would recommend it to anyone who visits Arizona.

When you are missing Mexico this is the place to hit up. Although the treats are not as good as the ones you would find in the state of Michoacan they are still good. I've tried basically everything on their menu, you can't go wrong with this place. So next time it gets 100 degrees and you want a little piece of Mexico, you know where to go!

Exceptional customer service, the waitress was very friendly and helpful. Delicious food!!!! All of the ingredients used are natural and of quality. They buy from local suppliers when possible. I had the Griddle Cakes, to die for! Especially when they have me handmade strawberry jam. I definitely suggest these if you love pancakes. I wish their floors would have been cleaner, but I can only imagine how hard it is to maintain them when they are extremely busy. Definitely check it out! My friends from out of town truly enjoyed it.

I've been going to this establishment for the past five years! I literally walk there all the time since it's super close to my house. Just kidding! I've only walked there once because my car broke down lol. Anyways, their hot dogs are to die for! I've tried so many Sonoran hotdogs in AZ and none come close to Mr. Triny's! Their champurrado is the best Mexican hot drink to have during the winter time. I am not the only one obsessed with these hotdogs so it's my family! We love Don Triny. He is so nice and welcoming :) great service!

This place is awesome IF you have table which they start at 9000.00. I've gone in a couple of times with reservations and it's no problem to get in, but then I've also gone other times with out a table and it has been hell! If you are willing to wait then you are looking at an approximate wait time of an hour to two hours unless you have a  couple of hot, thin, caucasian females with you then you might get in earlier. You could bribe the bouncer and get in quicker so unethical! I like how classy and fancy this place is, that is why I go, but if I have to wait you better believe I much rather go to Mint. Oh another thing, their drinks start at 10.00. I've seen discrimination towards minorities occur at this location. Very pathetic! I hope this place goes out of business soon. Although with all those bribes and the ridiculous amount of money they charge for things they might just manage to stay open longer. Don't go unless you have a table or are willing to waiting all night long .......

They need friendly people here! No one greets you or asks if you need help. Great customer service is needed in every business especially retail stores since they have face to face interactions with their customers 24/7. Although they have a big clothing selection and great prices I left with nothing because I didn't feel welcomed.

Great customer service! I was upset because I had just washed my car a couple of days ago and there was a dust storm. I went to this express location and the attendant gave me a discount for my car wash. He also gave me a free air freshener, a discount coupon for next time and a rug to clean the dust that got inside the car. He was very nice and friendly. Although there was a line he made things run smooth and efficiently. They hand dry your car which is unusual for express washes. I felt bad I did not have cash to tip the man, but I know that I will be back soon and he will be rewarded double for his hard work.
