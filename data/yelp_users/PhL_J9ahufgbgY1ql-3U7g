Johnson Utilities customer service is so terrible that some people actually cite it as a reason for moving away! Over the past several years they've had multiple incidents of customer complaints, some leading to public protests. They employ SLAPP tactics to aggressively discourage customers from speaking out. Recently, a Johnson Utilities spokesperson commented regarding the notification of a potential E. Coli contamination "The company said they didn't have enough time to go door to door and didn't send out an email to customers because not enough people have computers." In 2012 not enough people have computers? what about smart phones? The reality is that the company owners are completely out of touch with their customers and don't care since they're the only choice in town.
