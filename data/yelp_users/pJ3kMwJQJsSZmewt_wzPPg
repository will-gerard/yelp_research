Growing up on the North Side, where Mexican food is everywhere.  I am a bit of a snob when it comes to this.   My boyfriend and I moved to Chandler from Tempe and said oh let's get tacos!  We go to Los Favoritos and the cashier girl, was RUDE.  The food was medicore, the decor the same.  But the biggest issue was the beans. Seriously, rice and beans are a STAPLE.   The rice was decent, the beans just tasted like chicken broth. I thought beans had lard. But shit this gringa found better elsewhere. Pro's Cheap Cons decor food service.

I absolutely love this place! Good affordable Pho.  I can't really try anything else due to a fish allergy, but the PHO is awesome.  The broth is light but super flavorful. The meat is tasty, and the sides are just right.   4 stars because my allergy fear keeps me from being able to try anything else.

I didn't appreciate it taking over a half an hour to send something internationally. I was constantly questioning about what I was sending.  I had no issue with the notary- but when it comes to check out. It took way too long.  I asked for overnight shipping. I got two day.  I asked for UPS I got DHL.  She questioned the postal code for the country I was sending to. Nothing helpful or polite.   I may just go get notarized here and send via Fed-ex it's only 2 dollars more FOR OVER NIGHT.

Want simple? Easy? Yangtse is the place. Cheap. Clean. Tasty. A date for 2 for lunch is 20 bucks. I will take that any day. The portions are large and good. The people sometimes don't understand what you say. But that's okay.  I will keep going here. Yum!

Two Drive Thrus? 24 hours? Happy to help you customer service? Is that what you are looking for?  Run don't walk to Eribertos! I have tried almost everything from this place.  All hot, tasty delicious. I am a big fan of their rolled tacos. And the hot sauce! THE HOT SAUCE is amazing. But hey, that's just me go try for yourself!

I like Cheba. I have been going here for years. I like their sandwiches. But it's nothing above and beyond any other sub shop minus, the factor that they have spouts and I LOVE SPROUTS.   I also DIG their brownies, probably more than I should.   What I dislike is the service, half the time the employee's seem baked out of their mind and it takes them 10 minutes to make a sub when there is all of 2 people in the place already done eating.   I still will go here and enjoy my grub but definitely not tipping the employees.

I went there last night, and both my boyfriend had a bad experience. Let's start with we got the appetizers. Decent Appetizer Platter... minus the fact that it was cold. Margaritas- Okay nothing amazing. Cheese Crisp- Good Flavor, but hard to chew  The service/waitress was kind of rude, and wasn't very attentive even on the aspect of a glass of water.  We just figured we had a bad time and would try it again, that was until 2 am the next morning when he was puking his soul out.

I love ChuckBox. The quality of the meat and the status it is the place to go in Tempe.  My own real issue is how busy it is  all the time and the loud atmosphere other than that my burger and onion rings are always good and fresh!

Do you like Gelato? Go here. I am a big fan of fruity gelato and this place has so many! I got to try a variety of things. I ended up liking the grasshopper, but I bought some grapefruit(What kind of arizonan am I?) It was bomb diggity reminded me as a kid picking a grapefruit off a tree and putting a little sugar on top. The boo got ferrer roche. He loved it, said it was a little too peanut buttery.   It would be 4.5 but  I can't do that. The cashier wasn't very chatty, helpful but offered no real suggestions.  I would go again no doubt!

I cannot get enough of Cafe Istanbul.  I have been going here for approximately 8 years.   The gyros, the kebabs, kafta, falafel. It's just good.  It's enjoyable the people care about what they do and the service they bring you.

My name is Jill and I have a mild addiction to their steak plate. I usually come home from tempe and just grub until I can't breathe from their food. So good. great service and they know your order if you go there enough. I can't say enough great things about this place:)

I went here on a recommendation.  I have a wedding I am in for tomorrow, and because of prior emergencies- I couldn't make their nail date.  I called beforehand to make sure I could get in.   As my 2:15 appointment rolls in  I get assisted by a lady - She says hello. I give her the nail polish, and the "order" a gel manicure and an express pedicure ( no one is seeing my toes I just wanted to live a little).   My pedicure goes fine, no talking to me nothing. I just sat there. That was lovely.  We got over to where the manicures are done.  I noticed at this time, none of the stuff is packaged ( just in a plastic container), but more on that later.She speaks in some language to another girl ( still no conversation other than hit the machine when the 45 seconds are up).  She picks another color to work with the initial nail color.  I don't mind it's still within the realm of what the bride wants so whatever.   She gets to my hands and  more than one of my cuticles was torn out - she went and got some blue stuff (whatever that is) to pour over my nail.  Burns like hell.  She continues to paint my nails.  By 2:45 I was out the door.   The whole scenario was VERY rushed.  No conversation, not a care in the world. My fingers still have blood in the cuticles after washing my hands and that just isn't classy.   But before I left-  I just saw my manicurist- throw all the tools in some water. I personally am just concerned  the sanitary conditions now.   Because- if they are in the box not wrapped or anything- just  laying out in a plastic container.

Overall this place is pretty good.  I have a severe fish allergy and they found me something I could eat. (Score!) My boyfriend got the marinated pork which he loved. I got a stew of some sort, with all kinds of yummy tripe, beef, insert random beef product.  The ice tea was delicious, and the people were friendly. Nicely done. I will likely stick to my typical Pho place but it is on my list!

This place is AWESOME.  I usually go for the Swedish meatballs, with the creamy dill potatoes and their coleslaw, then some green beans. OH my goodness! So tasty. The coleslaw is sweet and sour style just like my Oma makes and I could possibly eat the entire bin. The meatballs and tender and juicy and you will likely want more.But you are about to explode from all the food you just ate. Then your eyes glance over to the baked good section... those oatmeal cookies... yes they have oatmeal but its almost like brittle mixed with some sort of crack. Or their pavalova which is meringue and oranges and pretty much the best thing that your mouth has tasted  other than their other food.  Customer service is always great the owner is so sweet! Her son is a doll and sells some of his own jewelry creations. So check it out you wont complain. But just dream of Sweden, Poland, and even Canada because this eclectic mix is not to be missed!

This place is great! If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor. You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere. With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating. They have a great happy hour prices!  Overall great prices, great people, and a great time! If you have the right mind :)

So it was my birthday. My lovely fiance looked on Yelp and saw that this place supposed to be good.   I say yeah sure whatever lets go. We arrive the place has great ambiance, wino theme with some rustic touches. I think great this is neat.  We order our drinks  and our bruschetta.     The bruschetta was great    Before hand we ordered our meals, the fiance got the bacon wrapped quail. I got the stuffed pork chop. Thinking this place has such great reviews this should be good.   As I cut into my meal  it looks okay from the outside, it's stuffed so no worries. I further investigated my meat and it was PINK. Which makes me automatically lose my appetite. My fiance was concerned with how small the bird was for the price.  We tell our waitress , Jennifer who was great.    She comes back asking if I want a new one or a refire on the pork. I just respond I was done and that was it.  The fiance states for 2 oz of quail wrapped in 2 pieces of bacon and a few fork fulls of greens it wasn't worth the 19 dollars.   Overall I am not thrilled with what I ate. Especially with the protocol on how to cook meat.   I will be kind and give 2 stars for Jennifer she was dope.   If I end up puking tonight or get a tape worm, this will be a one star vote.

We are not worthy!  So today, I finally convinced my boyfriend to try to this place. He is not a fan of enclosed food items.  But we were sold here!  Clean place Friendly staff! I get the fact that he primarily does catering and markets. It's his business and it's awesome, I am just thankful it's down the road and if I need one I can get one now. The goods!  I had the Combo 2 Mini Sweet Pies -Lemon Cream( uh lemon is my favorite... so this was obviously delicious) -Spiced Apple( this one convinced the boyfriend to buy some to take home) 1 Salad -Celery Root/Apple/ Farro I had no clue what farro was, but I will eat it again! The PIE Green Chile. BOMB. SO GOOD. I loved the cliantro white sauce that came with it. REALLY REALLY GOOD.  The boo ended up having a green chile pork and a bleu and buffalo. He liked the green chile but was all about the buffalo.  Overall great place. Good Owners, Tasty food.

So my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out.  We walk in and it takes about 5 minutes before a waiter came to us and said,"Let me ask our manager if we are still serving."  It was 7 pm.  We left at about 8:30.  Overall the food was tasty. The olives- good minus the large ones that tasted too salty for either of our liking. The pork belly- so delicious, but it was on a large plate and my boyfriend said" either another one of these things or a smaller plate".  I had the pot roast- so delicious. I am a big fan of the butternut squash casserole.  He had The short rib on polenta and some chorizo sliders- he was a fan of both.  Overall it seemed like they were short staffed, and we waited a long while for our food. Yes it was delicious but the staff seemed too worn out from the day.   I would love it more if it was more organized maybe a hostess, maybe another chef, maybe some more waiters. Who knows just something was off minus the lock that didn't work in the handicapped women bathroom.

Right before I moved to Chandler, I got to try Salut!  We started off with the Chef's board-5/5  but we did find out they switch thigns out due to availability so you never know what you are going to get. We have had all the Panini's. All delicious. Try anything with Halluomi cheese it's so tasty.  My own main issue with this place is that  as a college student that used all of the social media, they marketed to me via instagram. Telling me to get wine. I am not a fan of alcohol (okay I am but I no longer drink).  So as long as their media coordinator isn't working it is all good.

I have this rule go here twice before you  review.  I still like it.   Growing up in a german home, its all of 2 things, clean and full of food. This place has both 1 star.  I assume the first time I met Oma. She was a sweet lady and we bonded over me ordering a lot of cabbage. Star 2. Throw in the tagsuppe of the day which that day was the Knopel.(sorry my spelling sucks). 3 stars.  I also enjoyed my brat. 4 Stars.  I leave and am satisfied.   The true test is when I bring in my ma.   Ma noticed that today was Dill pickle soup day, this pleases her immensely.  We get soup. It's delicious. 5 stars!   Her Rouladen was perfect. Mine was a little pink but thats okay everything else was good and I will still keep it 5 stars because some people like that.   I also like that its a atmosphere that is close to my home in comparison to  Zur Kate or even Haus'. This is more realistic , cheap and homey.  Alas I am still looking for the doner kebab of my dreams.  5 stars!
