This Michael's location is so inconsistent...Not to mention that it's located in one of the worst shopping centers in Phoenix. Just trying to park and get into the store can be a headache if you hit it at the wrong time of day.   Shelves always seem to be empty...displays are a mess and aisles are difficult to shop.  Good luck finding an employee to help you and if you do, don't bank on them being friendly. In all fairness, I can't say that *all* employees are miserable, I did have a friendly cashier once, but the majority of the time, customer service is not a priority at this location.   Chances are I won't be returning after my last visit. I can just as easily go to the Michael's up the street from my house or venture over to Paradise Valley where I have the choice between Michael's and Hobby Lobby.

I've had a gyro hankerin' for months and Cyprus Grill did not disappoint. In fact, I was so pumped about it that I went into work and shared the good news and one of my co-workers ended up going on their lunch break.  I went in around 1pm on a weekday and ordered a gyro pita with fries. There were a few other customers at the time and I ended up waiting less than 10 minutes for my order. Not bad. After I placed my order I regretted not getting greek fries, but when my food came I was not disappointed. The fries were excellent how they were and both them and my gyro were fresh. Next time I may get a side of tzatziki only because I like my food a little saucier than it came, but I have no complaints.   There was one girl working behind the counter taking orders and when I waited I noticed that she must also clean the dining room. Since it was after the lunch rush, there were a few tables that needed to be bussed but she was still busy with orders. It would have been nice if she had some extra help.  Thanks fellow yelpers for coming through on this one. I work in the Town & Country area, but because I don't pass this part of the mall I would have never realized that it was here.

Good little donut shop with a large selection and good pricing. I have only been here on weekday mornings, so as the day goes on, I'm sure the selection dwindles. My favorite is the apple fritter. Like another yelper said, it's crispy on outside and soft on the inside with a ton of apples.  I've also gotten the iced coffee (because I didn't want to make another stop). It was good, but for the price, I probably wouldn't get it regularly.  Regular donuts $1.00 Fancy donuts $1.95 (I think....) Iced coffee $2.35 (or close to that....comes in large only)  Don't quote me on the pricing, I'm going by memory and believe it or not, that's not always accurate.  Easy to access of 7th st, plenty of parking, friendly service.

I love Sky Harbor. Whether I am traveling or just there for a pick up or drop off, it is the easiest airport to get around. Good signage and not too jam packed. I think I have used all terminals at one time or another and have never had an issue.

I'm a sucker for a (good) all-you-can-eat establishment, especially when kids are involved. I met a friend here on a Monday afternoon (President's Day) for lunch, with kids in tow. 2 adults, 4 kids...you can imagine the line that we held up while going down the salad bar but everyone behind us was great. When we got to the register, one of the bussers offered to bring all of our trays to the table so we could get a seat comfortably.  The dining room is large and there are a lot of tables on the patio outside. We opted to eat in. Once we got our clan settled, we took a trip over to the soup and bread area. There were a lot of nice options to choose from. Love the cornbread and the cream of mushroom soup! Kids love the pizza and mac and cheese.  On our way to get dessert, we decided to all go together. I put the "We will return" card on the table, only to come back and find that our table had been cleared. One of the managers was walking by and could tell that a mistake had been made. She apologized and brought back brand new drinks for all of us. Great service.   All in all, it was a good experience and I would recommend Sweet Tomatoes to anyone who is looking for some family-friendly dining. Oh, and if you want to save some money, sign up for the email coupons.

Cheba Hut was one of those "must go to" places on my list for when I moved back to AZ. Unfortunately it took me over a year to get there. I had a hankerin' for a sandwich last week so I decided to venture to my least favorite part of Mesa to see if it was how I remembered.  I have to say that the whole ordering system is way more streamlined than it used to be. No more walking down the line while the person behind the counter asks if you want every condiment imaginable on your sandwich. You wait in a line to order while looking at the large menu posted on the wall, and when you get to the register the guy ringing you up asks what you want on it and rings you up accordingly. You pay and they bring it out to you. Instead of giving you a number, they give you a picture or character from a movie. Cute.  I ordered the Jamaican Red with hemp cream cheese. One of my favorites from the past. When I ordered, the guy ringing me up let me know it was an extra charge for the cream cheese. Thank you! It was just as I remembered. Buffalo chicken, olives, jalapenos, cream cheese....and toasted?!?! Yum!! I'm salivating just thinking of it now. They have an excellent selection of other sandwiches, salads, and treats. I didn't get one on this trip, but the rice krispee treats here are the best I've ever had (besides homemade). Back in the day I used to get the southwest chicken salad, also known as the AZ Homegrown. It was my #1 but it's not on the menu anymore. Curious if the White Widow replaced it? Maybe I'll give that a try next.  This location has some seating so even when crowded you can most likely get a table or pull up a stool along the window. My meal came to just under $12. Ouch! Although a little higher in price than what I like to spend on lunch, it won't deter me from going back.

I've been in this location a couple of times, and each time it has been a cluttered mess. Today it looked like they were trying to set up some Easter items, but no one was actually setting anything up. Instead it was half empty displays, no price tags...just a huge clusterf**k.  The regular, non-holiday aisles were an equal mess. Items just thrown down on the shelves, empty hooks, a lot out of place.  I didn't experience the customer service today, but on earlier trips the cashiers have been friendly enough and I was able to find someone on the floor.

There is nothing about this place from the outside that stands out and MAKES you want to shop here. I didn't read any reviews or look at any photos before making a stop here, so I expected it to be a dingy, poorly lit second-hand store filled with ladies' pant suits.   I couldn't have been more far off. I was immediately surprised when I opened the door and saw a big leopard print couch (first thing my kids saw too) and tables filled with accessories. The store is organized, clean, and bright. Just like any other store that sells used clothing, the selection will be hit or miss, but the prices are good and if you have time to browse then you will probably find something that you like.  I picked up a black American Apparel jersey skirt for $9. There was a little hole on the seam but nothing I can't fix. I was going to ask the girl working if she would lower the price but this was exactly what I had been looking EVERYWHERE for so it didn't matter to me that much.   They have a bunch of fun necklaces for $1.99 and other inexpensive jewelery. Don't expect high end or it to last long, but for that price it shouldn't matter. I can't wait to go back.

Stepping into Whataburger is like stepping into a time warp....and I LOVE it!   Fast food is fast food, but if I had to pick a "better" establishment, this would be it. The staff was more than accommodating, friendly, and genuinely hospitable. The girl who took our order hadn't been working there long so she needed to ask for some help, and the manager that came over to help her was patient and didn't talk down to her. She apologized to us a lot for not being very fast as she figured out the register but it didn't bother me at all. We laughed and I told her that I was super patient so it was no big deal. Later she stopped by the table to make sure everything came out correctly and we had a laugh (it had).  I saw a commercial the week before for the patty melt and it had been on my mind since. It was really good (for a fast food burger). The fries were fresh, the sweet tea was good, the kids ate ALL of their food....and weren't even upset that there wasn't a toy in the kids meal.  I'm so glad that we re-found this place...I now have no desire to go to any of the other fast food burger places.

So gross. So, so gross. I wasn't expecting fine dining, but seriously?!   There's nothing "New York" about this shit hole, unless you count the dirty prints on the wall.  Don't waste you're time or your money.

This is an older location, but Target is Target nonetheless.  They always seem to have what I am looking for (or not looking for..you always end up buying something you didn't intend on) and the shelves seem to always be stocked. The employees are nice and always say hello or ask if you need help. There are usually a couple registers open during non-busy times, and anytime I have been there when it has been busy, the lines move quickly.  This location isn't as nice as Tempe Marketplace or the store on Longmore but it's close to where I live, the parking lot isn't terribly annoying, and I know that I will be able to get what I need at a decent price.

Friendly staff. Not sure why I continue to use the drive through. If there is a long line, it's quicker to pull into a stall and order.

I've never met a taco didn't like. That being said, the shredded beef tacos are bomb!! If you are expecting a fancy Mexican spread then be prepared to be disappointed. This is quick, solid Mexican food.   My kids love coming here. The kids meals are cheap (something parents like) and they come with churros!! Need I say more?  I've never used the drive thru but it never seems to move quickly. Park and come inside so you can peruse the extensive menu. They also have different specials for each day of the week so look out for those. Oh, and the horchata is pretty good too.

When a party of 9 walks in during lunch and 2/3 of that party is made up of children under 8, you'd think most waitstaff would give an eye roll and exasperated sigh. Not at Liberty Market. As soon as we were half way in the door we were greeted, asked if we were there for lunch, and the guy asked one of the ladies to push a couple tables together for us.   We struggled with a couple of the little ones, who wants to sit where, grabbed some menus, and got down to business. I noticed a sign that mentioned to order your food first before taking a seat. Now I'm even more impressed since they got us a table which allowed us to really figure out what we were doing.  My girlfriends and I split the salmon BLT and some other sandwich, I don't remember which one. We also got the kale salad and the sweet potato salad. My daughter got the cheese pizza. The food was good. Wish we had room for rice pudding.  As we were finishing up, one of the cooks came out and complimented us on our kids being so well-behaved. Something every mom likes to hear. :)  The service alone us enough to make me come back. The food could have sucked (it didn't), and I would still be raving.

Tired of seeing the same ol' beer selection at our local grocery stores, we decided to head to GCM on Saturday night. Although our original intention was to get a growler filled and pick up a 6-pack, we brought a second growler just in case. Glad we did because not only in the beer selection on tap pretty massive, it's also pretty cheap. We got a couple trusty local brews that were $8.99/each (64 oz) but they had a few that were on sale for $4.99 and $5.99. Crazy!  The aisles are small but the shelves are packed. So many great choices. The cold selection was pretty good too and they had the normal selection that you would find in the grocery but they also had some other non-common beers too...just what we were hoping for.   The guys working were nice and service was good. (See my tip). Not quite sure why this place has $$$...It's not any more expensive than anywhere else. In fact, I think some of the beers were even cheaper here. However, if you want a single beer that's $15.99, you'll find that here as well.

Here is a shop that operates with honesty and integrity. I always get nervous going to a shop for the first time because I don't want to be talked into something I don't really need, but after my first two experiences here, I won't go anywhere else.   I had my wheel cylinders and front brake pads replaced back in December. Fast forward five months, and I get in my car one afternoon and the brake pedal goes to the floor. Luckily it still came to stop but I knew that I had to get in to see what was going on. Although there are many other "brake" shops around, I decided to drive back down to this shop just in case it was something that was previously worked on. They got my car in right away and luckily I was covered by a warranty (phew) so the work I needed done was at no cost. I was out of there in just a couple of hours.  There's more work that needs to be done on my car, and although I let Jason know that I have already been quoted a price, he looked it up again and tried to find ways to save me money. For someone who is on a tight budget and finds it hard to justify putting hundreds on dollars into a car that is on it's last leg, I'm incredibly appreciative.

I just received my August email from Ted's which reminded me that I need to write a review. In there email this month there is a coupon for a free regular dog with the purchase of a grilled item and a drink. Anyway...  We came for dinner one night (National Hot Dog Day to be exact...no deals though) and we got there early enough that the line wasn't long at all. If you have never been, be prepared to wait in line. It usually moves fast enough but this isn't the place you want to go when you are in a time crunch.  I usually get the all beef, but I got a regular dog this time. It was a a decent dog but I will be switching back the all beef. My hubby got a foot long. We shared an order of onion rings (but I'm sure I could have eaten one order to myself). They are the onion sting type, crunchy and wonderful.  We ordered a couple kids meals with corn dogs and fries. Everything is made fresh so if you go the corn dog route with your kids be warmed that they are fresh out of the fryer and you will need to let them cool. Kid's meals come with a drink and the hubby and I shared a regular drink. Our total came to just over $20. Refills on drinks are .25.  It's nice to have a little piece of New York in Tempe...I just wish I made it there more often.

Friendly staff, easy to make appointments. Our dog ate something that she shouldn't have and by the time we realized what was going on, it was stuck and she needed surgery to have it removed. Everyone was accomodating, we were able to get her right in, and the maintained excellent communication the day of the procedure and after.   The building itself isn't the nicest and the parking lot just downright sucks, but we are happy for the overall care of our pets. I'd definitely recommend..

This might be my favorite Starbucks on any of my usual routes. The parking lot and surrounding road construction is a little on the annoying side, but if you plan for it there's usually no problem.  The inside is on the smaller side. Not a lot of indoor seating but a good amount of tables outside. I've never been here when there are less than 3 people working behind the counter, and I'm quite impressed that they are as efficient as they are with such limited space.  My drink here has always been correct, quick, and service is always friendly.

Finally....my last few visits I have received exactly what I wanted and service has been good. I go to a few of the Einstein's in Phoenix, one in particular I refuse to step foot in again, but this location has been fairly consistent since I have been coming here.  If I don't end up getting what I order, they gladly fix. Mind you, I'm not high maintenance, I just don't like my bagel toasted.  I think that most people do get it toasted so the employees on the line are just in the habit of doing it and not paying attention to the order screen.  Bagel selection is always pretty good in the morning, a few items sold out here and there but they are baking all the time.  Iced coffee is good too. I'll be back, for sure.

Clean theaters. Comfortable seats. Friendly staff. Concession lines move quickly.   Movie going doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. Buy a gift card for $25 or more and get a voucher for a free medium popcorn. Use that gift card for your movie tickets. Upgrade your popcorn to a large for $1.00 more. Buy the refillable cups on one of your visits and refill for the rest of the year for $1.50 each visit.   Harkins definitely has the best theaters in Phoenix.

I don't think there is anything to say about Silver Cinemas that hasn't already been said. Great little dollar theater with $3 movies everyday except Tuesday when they are $1.50. Concession prices are similar to that of a regular theater, but there are also deals on Tuesday.  The theaters themselves are a good size. The seats are far from luxurious but they are comfortable enough. A slight incline to the stadium seating so if you are bringing small children with you, be prepared to move if an adult sits in front of them. The projector quality is fair, not the clearest picture.  Be sure to get here on time, if not a few minutes early. They don't play previews like the big box theater so if you are the type of person who runs late because you don't care to see what's coming soon, you're bound to miss the beginning of the movie.

What a great library. The children's section in quite large and the staff is always helpful. There are some computers for the kids with games, and a play area for smaller kids. We haven't come to any of the events but there are kids craft days that sound fun.  The whole library is well organized, easy to find what you are looking for if you don't have much time. However if you do have a lot of time on your hands, there's a lot of seating and room to read.  I'm sure we'll be here a lot in the summer.

I only come here to buy hair color and they usually have what I am looking for. Store is pretty clean and well stocked. Customer service is what is lacking though, hence the two stars. No one working here goes really goes out of their way to be friendly. A lot of chatter happens in the back of the store amongst employees when they should be out of the floor helping customers or at the register so they can see who goes in and out.

Changing my 3 starts to 4.  The produce quality has been pretty good lately. I was excited for the strawberry sale this last week (4 for $5) and although the strawberries could have been more ripe, this wasn't the fault of sprouts.  The meat dept always has good prices. You can find "manager's special" sausage in the pre-pack case for $1.99/lb. Needless to say, I trust the meat here, so that in itself is is worthy of 5 stars...but this isn't just a butcher shop.  GREAT prices on beer if you buy what's on sale. San Tan 6-packs for $6.99?! YES!!! In the last 4 or 5 weeks, it's been this price twice.

This was my first time in a print shop since probably 2006, so when my printer decided to go on the fritz and I had a million things that needed printing, my husband suggested going to kinkos. Thankfully when I typed in kinkos.com into my browser, it defaulted here.  It seems like most things are do-it-yourself, but if you need assistance, the guys working behind the counter will come out and help you. I was a little confused at first but figured things out pretty quickly. I just needed to print things off a flash drive, so I found a printer, put my flash drive and debit card in, and everything came up on a little screen. I was concerned that I was going to have to reformat everything so I was happy that it showed me the print preview before hand. If you have to print more than one document then you have to select "start over". When you are finished, hit "done" and your debit card comes right out. There is another machine where you can put money onto a FedEx prepaid card, but that must be if you are using cash.   They have a decent selection of office supplies, envelopes, folders, paper, etc. and a stand of books on leadership and work related topics.

This is a nice, small location, tucked into a fairly vacant strip mall. Easy to get in and out without having to battle a bunch or cars looking for parking spots.  The staff is nice and it always seems like they have too many people working. I have never had to wait for someone to take my order or longer than necessary for my drink to be made. I always get the same thing (Orange Dream Machine) and it's consistent at every location I have been to.  Every time I have been in they have had samples out. I like that, but it's never signed so you never know what it is unless someone tells you.   A good 4-stars all around.

Located on a semi-busy corner but it's easy to get in and out. If you have to go inside for anything it can be hit or miss. Sometimes you get right up to the cashier, sometimes there is a line. They now take your Safeway reward points for fuel discounts. There is a car wash but I have never used it. The water and air machine is $1.00 for 3 min. Not sure what the vacuum costs.

I have been to Discount Tire a few more times than I have actually checked in for in the last few weeks, and every time I consider writing my review, my number of stars change with each experience. I decided to wait until my actual tire purchase and with all experiences combined, I guess I will settle for four stars.  My tires were looking a little low, and after struggling with the air machine at a local gas station I decided to try to get my tires filled at Discount Tire. A girlfriend told me that it was great, just just pull up into a line, leave your car running, they bring you water, and you're out of there. She must have gone by a different location. I went by 5 times (all different days) and there were people parked in the "air check" lanes, or there were tires piled up where it looked like they waved people in. One time I got out of my car to go in and ask because I was confused but it was so busy that I just left.   A couple days later I came by to get my tires inspected. Rich was super nice, gave me some prices and filled my tires since I couldn't afford to have them replaced right then. The next week I called to set up an appointment to buy one tire (even though I needed two). The guy that answered the phone was nice enough.   Appointment day came. I knew what I wanted and wasn't going to budge. The guy changing my tire brought my other one in that needs to be replaced and tried talking me into doing it right then. I got a little annoyed because he wasn't taking no for an answer and I thought for a second that they might not let me leave. Another Assistant Manager stepped in and took care of everything. I left happy.  So, in a nutshell: Confusing "air check". Good tire purchase experience with fast turn around. Nice staff but service is inconsistent the majority genuinely want to provide a good customer experience and want to help.

I randomly looked at my groupons today and realized that this one was expiring so we went for an after school treat.  There are so many choices!! I got the strawberry cheesecake with ice cream on the bottom (would have been better without). My kids got root beer float and pink bubblegum. All with cream. They tasted exactly like you would think.  I wish there had been some outdoor seating, maybe there is later into the season. When we got there it was pretty empty but filed up quick.   All the kids working were really nice, probably the best customer service I have experienced from highschoolers. I overheard a lot of them making recommendations.  I wish they had a sampler on the menu. There are so many flavors, it be nice to have an option to try five or so, in a smaller capacity. I was also impressed that the sugar free flavors are sweetened with stevia, and not that Splenda crap.  I'll be back for sure...and i'll be getting the pickle juice flavor.

I haven't been into an Albertson's in the last 7 years so I thought I would give it a shot. Although this was my first time in this location, it looks exactly like I had remembered it...and smelled the same too.   The store was incredibly empty. I only saw a handful of other shoppers and the staff that I encountered didn't even say hello. (Trust me, they weren't busy working either) The shelves were relatively full and the store was clean.  I came specifically to pick up some chicken for dinner so I didn't check out the entire meat department. I did notice there were a lot of items that we marked with "Buy 1, get 2 free" stickers, but after looking the price, no thank you. $11+ for two chicken breasts pre-seasoned with what I imagine is just some Lawry's Seasoning Salt? What a rip off. Luckily I was get getting the plain chicken breasts that were on sale ($1.98/lb). After reading other reviews, it sounds like this pricing is common practice. I also came in to see if they had any corn on the cob. It took me a minute to find it because it was all pre-wrapped in 4 cob packages for $2.99. Normally I would have passed but it was a special request from one of my kids so I bought it anyway.  Check out was quick (because there were no shoppers) and my cashier let me know that I didn't need my savings card anymore. With all of the grocery competition in the Phoenix area, it's hard to believe that Albertson's is profitable, because there really isn't much of an incentive to shop here.

I've only been here to get gas, never to go inside. I've always been able to get right up to a pump, but I think that lines have formed every time I have been. The parking is horrible, I think that a lot of people used the shopping center lot next door and walk over.

My family and I came here on a weekend afternoon to browse since we haven't seen many nurseries around since moving to the area. We weren't sure what to expect but we have been excited to start planting and wanted to get some ideas. I'm so happy we came by. This was a great find.  The nursery is fairly large and has everything from trees, to ground cover, to hanging baskets, and succulents. The pottery selection is pretty nice as well and decently priced. We are always checking out tomato and pepper plants, and the selection was a good size and looked good. I didn't see any certified organic plants, but they do have seeds in the chemical area. I didn't see any herb plants on the day that we went, and those that they did have looked like they got too much sun, but just vegetables, they have a lot of herb seeds as well.   I'm excited to go back to pick up some plants and flowers, and my kids will be excited to go back and gawk at the birds.

I've only been into this location a handful of times. Each time it has been incredibly messy, poorly organized, and unless I am looking for something in particular, I walk through and walk out.  Poor quality for what you pay and inconsistent customer service paired with being put on edge with the amount of clutter is enough for me to stay away, no matter how many coupons you try to throw my way.

I'll keep it short and sweet. If you want a salon that's over the top glitzy, brand new everything, too many people, all of whom are on their cell phones, then this probably isn't the salon for you. I, on the other hand, prefer to judge where I get my hair done based on the quality of the work, so that's why I see Jeff at Hair Stalgia.  The salon is small and the stylists who work here stay busy. Everyone is super nice, prices are reasonable, and the retail selection is superb. I just got my hair done but I'm already looking forward to my next appointment.

Dilly's in one of the many places I was stoked to go to after moving back to the Valley. When I saw that on Saturday and Sunday kids eat free, I knew we had to go.  I remember when this location opened and it is exactly.the.same. I used to come over here to get lunch on my lunch break from Tower Records. It was like stepping into a time machine and my go-to sandwich (the Gobbler) was EXACTLY the same. I'm pretty bummed that I didn't get the Wisconsin Cheese soup. Next time.  The guy working the register wasn't all that friendly. Fairly curt, actually. The seating area was a mess, looks like the tables hadn't been cleaned in awhile. It was getting dark outside and just as equally dark inside. Maybe there were some lights that needed to be replaced?   The experience was just ok...I started by giving the place 3 stars but added another because my food was pretty good. Exactly what I had wanted and my husband was happy with his as well (Humdinger). The kids grilled cheese was pretty gross, but to be fair, I took a bite when it was cold.

If you're in the market for a new pair of Birkenstocks, this is the place to go. They have a large selection but whether or not they have your size in the style and color you want is another story. The Shoe Mill carries many other shoe brands, all of them leaning more on the side of comfort, than fashion. Definitely worth checking out if you spend hours on your feet and are in the market for something comfortable. Staff is helpful and accommodating.

I just started shopping around for a bike and this was my first stop. I was the only shopper in the store and had the opportunity to look around a bit before being approached. The girl who came our and greeted me told me to let her know if I needed anything and that I could take a bike out to test ride it. I appreciated that some one wasn't breathing down my neck the whole time.  They have a lot of cruisers and seemed fairly reasonably priced. I noticed a few dents and chips in the paint on a few bikes but they have more than one of each model. I'm sure I will be back when I'm in more of a serious purchase mode.

Everybody expects to have a great time at a baseball game and Chase Field does not disappoint. 4.5 stars all the way...bumped it up for reasons you will read below.  Parking is easy, and relatively cheap. Like another yelper said, if you can find meter parking, you can park for free (after 5pm and on weekends I believe...but some spots on the weekend are covered for permit parking only). If you don't care to drive around on the hunt for an open meter, there are a lot of $5 lots within an easy walking distance.  The box office usually has enough windows open, so if you are waiting you won't wait for long. Employees are friendly and helpful. If you get there more than two hours before game time, expect to stand in a line to get into the ballpark, especially if there is a sweet giveaway.  The inside is spacious, and laid out in a way that even at it's most crowded, it's not too claustrophobic. The team shops are easy to move around in as well. On the third level is where the kids pay area is located. That gets a little packed and hard to maneuver since there seems to be an unusually high number of cell-phone talking, middle of the walkway standing, not paying attention to what's going on, patrons. While you're up in the kids area, make sure to sign up for the Kids Club and check in to every game the kiddos come to on the little kiosks. Here they will get prizes for every game attended. You can also sign your kids up for the "No Chew Crew" (they will promise not to chew or use tobacco) and get a punch card for free kids admission to every Sunday home game. (Redeemable at the box office on the day of the game).  The food selection is pretty good and there are "value items" at the regular baseball-fare stands. (I don't remember what the food venue is called). My only gripe is that "premium" beer is $11 and if it's draft, you can only get it large. I don't drink crap so I'm not interested in the $4 drafts that some of the smaller beer stands advertise. It's $11 or nothing...so I opted for nothing this last visit and that's why I docked Chase Field .5 stars.  All in all, a visit to Chase Field is a great time. Bring the kids, let them play, pack a lunch if you like (yes, you can bring in outside food), and enjoy the day, or evening. They no longer play the intro in the big screen of the baseball bouncing through Arizona and ending up in the rattlesnake's mouth (I LOVED that!), but I promise that you won't be disappointed.  Side note: If you download the MLB "At the Ballpark" app you can check in while you are there. The 50th person to check in gets upgraded seats. I don't remember where they are located but I believe there are 4 of them and they are really good. You can also order food from the app but we didn't try it.   PLAY BALL!

Still 5 stars.... *Love the remodel of the team shop that was done last year. This year they have WAY more women's merchandise and a lot if it is good. I'm not a fan of the PINK brand baseball gear or the bedazzled clothing but if that's your thing, the team shop does not disappoint. *Kid's club check ins this year are super easy since the card is now on a lanyard, complete with barcode and Sunday game punch boxes. Very smart, keep it this way! *LOCAL BEER!!!! Finally!! The Draft Room is the best place for beer in the stadium, but if you happen to be there on a day when there is a private party and you can't get in, Paradise Valley Burger Co is a good second choice. I went down to get another beer at the top of the 7th and they were closing though so that sucked. They also have great sweet potato tots. *Easy light rail access. *Friendly staff, from the box office to the ushers, for the most part. Those working in the kid's area seem a little miserable (play areas, not at the kid's club desk) as well as some of the elevator operator ladies.  Despite some little bumps in the road, it's still a solid 5 stars. Favorite place to spend a Sunday afternoon in PHX.

3 stars for the food, an extra star for the service.  I met my girlfriend here for lunch on a weekday. When I arrived she was already seated (right next to the door so we got the hot breeze anytime someone opened it...oh well) and our server was right there so he brought mine and my kids drinks right away. The longer we were there, the more packed it became. This place must do really well during the week for lunch.  I ordered the gyro with fries ($8) and my kids both had mac and cheese with applesauce ($4.99). It's surprising that there is nothing "greek" on the kids menu. Instead, it's your typical "I can get this boring, typical kids food anywhere" food. My girlfriend ordered the pork souvlaki sandwich, per our servers recommendation, with a greek salad (also $8). The servings were a good size, her salad was pretty big, and the fries portion was large too. We ordered the sun-dried tomato hummus but it didn't come out so we asked about it when he brought our food. Apparently the kitchen had the tickets messed up. He comped us on that, and it was pretty good. Small portion for $5 and not enough pita.   I think that they have deals every once in awhile on groupon, or living social...not 100% sure which site I have seen them on. I would snatch one if I saw it again, and use that to come back. There are tons of other options out there if I am paying full price.

Unforunately, I was underwhelmed. I read reviews prior to going to Restaurant Mexico the other night and I went in with low expectations. Maybe that isn't totally fair, but then again, that's why I yelp.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas. I ALWAYS order cheese enchiladas when it's my first visit to a Mexican restaurant. The sauce was bland (red), thus causing my enchiladas to be flavorless. Like many reviewers before me, the dish was lukewarm. My iced tea was the highlight of my meal. I don't think I would consider putting cinnamon in my iced tea but for that, one star.   My girlfriend had the green chilie burrito and seemed to enjoy it. She also had the chorizo tostada and liked that as well. Another star for her enjoying her food.  Service...meh. We were one of two tables in there. Our server was overly attentive.   I don't want to say I would never go back, there's always a possibility. I just won't be going out of my way.

I've been an Ikea shopper for years. Whether it's Tempe, Seattle, or Philly, all Ikea stores are the same. Cute little displays that make you want to redesign all of your living spaces, tons of shoppers, items that you didn't come for but now you MUST HAVE.   On our last trip here, we took advantage of the delivery option. We purchased a mattress and a bed and didn't feel like strapping it to the top of the car. After making our purchase we awkwardly wheeled it on over to the home delivery desk. One employee was on the phone and after standing there for about 5 minutes, she called over someone else to help us. Home delivery starts at $59. We live about 12 miles from the store and was expecting to pay more but nope...$59 for us. The guy who set us all up was able to get us in the system quickly and they were able to deliver the same day. Score!   Our delivery window was from 5-9pm. Luckily the third-party service that was contracted to deliver came around 6:30pm. They were quick, unloaded our items, and offered to put them where we wanted.   Just like many other reviews say, you get what you pay for. Yes, much of the furniture is inexpensive, but I've had some pieces that have lasted forever. I've had my tv stand for almost 13 years and the crib/toddler bed I bought my oldest lasted through many moves and was assembled and disassembled many many times. I have also had pieces that I have put together about 90% of the way only to find that two boards don't line up. In that instance, I'm thankful that Ikea makes returns as easy as can be.   Last but not least, just a note for my fellow shoppers. Ikea is great for wandering and you can spend hours doing just that. Please be mindful of others around you and don't walk five abreast down the walkway, park your huge shopping carts in the path of others, or let your kids kick their shoes off and wrestle where everyone else is trying to walk (yes, this happened). Some of us know what we are there for and want to get in and out. Thanks.

Love Penzey's!!! What a fun store. Whether you go in with certain spices in mind or just to browse, you're bound to leave with some awesome choices.  Most items come in multiple size options. I am in love with the tiny glass jars. If you use a lot of a certain spice/herb, you can purchase it in a larger bag and jar it yourself if you prefer (empty jars available). There is also a large selection of gift boxes so if you are trying to find a gift for someone who has everything or is difficult to shop for, these are excellent options.  The only drawback for me is that I don't believe they have any organic options. I didn't expect them to, given the size and that it's a specialty store. It isn't a dealbreaker for me, but for some it could be. Because I prefer to have the choice, I will probably continue to purchase my common spices at places like Whole Foods, but for more uncommon and fun mixes, I will shop here.

Wanted to check out a different farmer's market so we came here over the weekend. It was a quick walk from the Roosevelt Light Rail station. A lot of vendors selling a variety of different items. I didn't come prepared to do a ton of shopping, but next time I will be.   The website is updated every week to let you know which vendors will be at the market in case you are making a special trip or trying to track someone down.  Ooh..and I loved that there were misters. Thank you!

Three words....Brown Velvet Cupcake.   Great selection of cupcakes, cookies always stacked high and look amazing (I've never met a Snickerdoodle I didn't like), vegan donuts also look delish.  My last stop in was for a couple cupcakes for my girlfriend's birthday. The employee that helped me wrapped the box nicely with a purple ribbon and a brown paper "Happy Birthday" tag. Clean and simple.  The shop is small but delivers big on quality and selection.  Love this place.

I'm a huge public transportation fan and prefer to take it rather than driving, as long as it's fairly direct. The light rail gets me to places I need to go (Festivals in Tempe, Central Phoenix for dinner and drinks) and with trains coming every 20 minutes or so, you don't have to wait forever.  Yes, Phoenix is a huge city and this is a fairly new addition, so it doesn't and will probably never compare to the rail systems in other large, metropolitan areas. For what it is though, it's pretty great, and gets nowhere near the amount of respect that it should. Bike hooks so you don't have to stand and try to move your bike for passer-byes? That's awesome. Buttons on the outside so the doors can remain closed before the train takes off and you don't die of heat in the summer months? That's pretty awesome too.  The payment system is a little obnoxious if you have never ridden it before and yes, it could be extended further into Mesa and Northern Phoenix (but that comes with time and more money, people), but once you get it down, you're all good. Now you'll save money by not having to pay a huge fee to park your car and you can spend that extra cash on more beer...then stumble down to the train station where the light rail will bring you home (or close to it). Brilliant!

I've been to this location a few times now. It's a good size and I can always find what I am looking for, and usually something that I wasn't, of course.  Went in over the weekend to do some trade. They weren't too busy so it was taken care of pretty quickly. Found a video game in the meantime that my kids thought would be fun.  When we went to pay, the cashier had to go in the back to get the game and was gone for quite some time. I *kind of* understand why they probably do this, but as we stood there waiting, the line behind us started to form and I started to feel like a jerk. There should be a better system for this, but I don't know what it would be. I'm sure they have tried and this is just what works best.  I will be back for sure. Even when my daughter wanted the new Katy Perry cd and we paid the full $18.99 for it...I would rather give my money to a real record store than to "insert discount box megastore here".

I love learning stores for educational toys/games/art supplies for the kids and this one does not disappoint. They have a large selection and the staff is friendly. Some items may be considered overpriced, like another yelper suggested they could just go to Wal-Mart for their pens, but that's expected.   I, myself, am not a teacher but was shopping with a girlfriend who is. She shared the same sentiments about there not being much for a teacher who teaches outside of Elementary. Nonetheless, it's worth checking out. I also believe they offer a teacher's discount.

I've never considered reviewing a service provider, but I have been impressed with their customer service so I did a quick check...low and behold they ARE on here for me to review.  I didn't want cable, only internet, but when I went into the store at Tempe Marketplace during the Black Friday deals I was talked into getting it. Alright, alright. Oh, and I can cancel at anytime? Even better.   I was given two self-installation kits (weird) so I wouldn't have to pay to have someone come out. Came home, got internet up and running no problem. Cable, not so easy. I gave them a call the next day to see what I was doing wrong, and it turns out there was an issue and they would send someone out the next day. I wouldn't have to be home.  The next day came and went, still nothing. Gave them a call again. Turns out the cable guy came out (didn't leave a note) but it turns out there needs to be an installation and they will have to come inside. Scheduled it for another day, guy came out, hooked it all up, no charge.  Fast forward almost 6 months and I haven't cancelled my cable. I don't remember what my "introductory rate" was, but my bill hasn't changed much. Anytime I have had to call them, I get right through. I've even sent an email and got a reply the next day. There have even been months that I haven't been able to pay my bill on time, but I have called and they have done a post dated payment. No problem and no interruption to service.   Cox has great service and is so much easier to deal with than any other cable company that I have had (Comcast, Verizon, Qwest). The only thing I don't like is the On Demand menu, but that's so insignificant that it hardly matters.

We've ordered from this place many times, but the last time was the first time we got delivery. Sunday evening , right at dinner time, and we got our food incredibly quick.  The wonton soup is amazing...probably one of the best I've had. It's fairly reasonable too. The sweet and sour chicken is my girl's favorite and the general tso's is also one of our favorites. This last time I ordered we also got a small order off roast pork lo mein (in case it was horrible). It was really good and I'll be ordering a large next time.

Clean location, and fast. The guy that made our sandwiches was friendly and joked around with my kids when they traded in their "Free Cookie" coupons that they got from the Dbacks game.  Subway, in general, not just this location, has really skimped down on everything the last few years. I don't go to these shops often, but even since the last time I have been to one, the meat and the toppings seem to be getting less and less. Back in the 90's, this was the place to get HUGE sandwiches. Not that we need to be eating humungous servings, but I rather have tons of veggies instead of a sandwich that's mostly bread.

I think I just gained 10 pounds by looking at the Bakery case. I told my five year old to be careful and not get her hand prints all over the glass but I think I was being just as bad. I'm kicking myself now for walking away with nothing, but I couldn't make up my mind. Everything looked so good and they have a great selection of different items.  I love this store. Today was probably the busiest I have seen it (lunch time on a Wednesday) but it was easy to get around. The deli could have used some more staff. I was going to get the pizza special but decided against it because we were waiting for too long.  They carry some great items and are reasonably priced, but if you are expecting Fry's type deals, you won't find it here. Yes, it's part of a chain (a local one at that), but not a big box, fluorescent lighted, SUPERmarket.  The only area I don't like is checkout. One cashier...on a Wednesday at lunch rush. She called for two other people to come help but they didn't show. Instead the Store Director hopped on register to help...always happy to see a manager jump in where needed.

I've been here a couple times, not looking for anything in particular. It's a large space and fairly clean and bright but for some reason this place really skeeves me out. I can't quite put my finger on what it is though.  The women's section is fairly large. The last day that I went, skirts were pretty sold down the "non-summer clothing" was abundant. The men's section looks limited but I didn't take the time to walk through it. Kid's was fairly limited as well.  I usually enjoy thrift store shopping and searching through the racks to find that one awesome piece of clothing, but this location doesn't really have that going on...at least not for me anyway.

Store closing but not quite sure of the date. There are some deals to be had but there were also a bunch of holes in the store when I was there a couple weeks ago. It's worth checking out if you are a bargain hunter. You never know what you might find.

This was my first trip into a Jason's Deli. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I don't think it was this. This location is huge (are they all this size?), ample seating, friendly staff, intimidating long line but it moves quickly.  I ordered a Hot Corned Beef sandwich on white, with swiss and russian dressing. Basically a Reuben with no sauerkraut on a different type of bread, and less expensive. Jason's doesn't have coleslaw or else I would have had them make me a Rachel...oh well. My sandwich was good, my fault I didn't have them toast or grill the bread. There was hardly any dressing on it, but now I know for next time.   If I didn't have a hankerin' for a sandwich, I might have gotten the salad bar. It looked really good when I walked past and I thought the express all-you-can-eat salad bar and soup register (for credit or debit only) was nice, and probably cuts down on the line that this place must form everyday around lunch.  I picked up a menu to bring home so I will be reminded to return when I am looking for a good sandwich and reasonable kids meal pricing. I will definately be back.

If I were to base my place of residence on adorable, warm, and friendly coffee establishments, I would without a doubt move to South East Gilbert. It's a shame I live so far from this place.  The Coffee Shop is tucked into Agritopia (directly across from the farm stand and across the courtyard from Joe's Farm Grill) and has a good amount of seating inside and out. In addition to their coffee menu, they also serve breakfast and lunch, and have an awesome pastry case.   On this trip we didn't have a meal, just iced coffee and a huge chocolate chip cookie. The coffee was awesome and the cookie was soft with gooey chocolate chips. The line was pretty long to order but seemed to move quickly (even with some large, indecisive groups ahead of us).  Although there are numerous places between where I live and Gilbert to grab my daily iced coffee, whenever I am headed out that way I'll most likely just hold off so I can stop here and enjoy the surroundings.

I gave my daughter a couple options when it came time to book her birthday party somewhere, and after researching online and Yelp, of course, I was confident when I said we could check out the bowling alley. We stepped one foot inside and YEP, decision was made. No "insert name of dirty, overpriced, kid pizza arcade" here!  They have a Birthday Party office near the front door and I was given info on what they have to offer (same info online) and it was easy to call back to make arrangements. They offer parties on Saturdays and Sundays, two times each day. What was one reserved as "Midnight Bowling" back in my day, they do during the birthday party times so the kids get the excitement of black lights and neon...No boring bowling here. If space allows, there is open bowling going on at this time too. Cosmic bowling is where it's at!  We opted for the party time on a Saturday, 11:15am-12:45pm and got the package that includes game cards for the arcade, glow necklaces for the guests, and a souvenir bowling pin for the birthday kid. There are many add ons that you can purchase which I initially skipped but on the day of the party we added wristbands for the bumper cars which allowed the kids unlimited rides.  Our party host was Chloe and she was super nice. She had our lanes set up when we arrived, complete with name tags for each guest at their placesetting on the tables and shoes on their chairs. She took great care of us, made sure that we had everything we wanted, made an obnoxious amount of balloon animals for the kids, and hustled things along pretty well. An hour and a half isn't long, so she made sure to reserve a spot for us in the cafe area and out all of our items over there.  If you opt for the package with the arcade games, keep in mind that the timeframe for the party will extend past an hour and a half. By the time we had finished with bowling, pizza, cake, and the dancing that they throw in, it was already time for the parents to pick the kids up and we had just gotten the game cards for the arcade. Had I known we would get them last I would have extended the time on the invitations so the other parents weren't waiting around.  Birthday parties can get quite expensive, and after adding on extra food, a pitcher of beer (for the husband and friends), and wristbands for the bumper cars, I spent more that I originally wanted to but after seeing the excitement on my daughter's and her friend's faces, it was well worth it. We could have booked a party elsewhere and spent just as much but it wouldn't have been as much fun.

I have this app on my phone that lists the places near you where kids eat free on specific days. It's usually full of sub-par diners, but when I saw Rumbi's listed, I had to jump on yelp to see what people had to say. Mixed reviews, so I took a quick peek at the menu, it sounded good, so we decided to check it out.  The restaurant was fairly clean and a few other families were eating when we got there. We perused the menu longer than we usually do but we didn't feel in the way or rushed in any way. They have everything from rice and noodle bowls to burgers to sandwiches to seafood. It was hard to decide.  I ordered the fish tacos and polished off the whole plate in no time. The order came with two tacos (type of fish not specified) and rice with beans. I seriously ate it so fast that I can't tell you what all was in it. Pretty sure the salsa was tomato, onion, pineapple, and cilantro. There may have been cabbage, and a jalapeno ranch type sauce. Don't quote me on it though. The rice and beans were really good and scented but I couldn't pinpoint the flavor. Very good though.  Husband had the Kahuna burger (two patties, pineapple, swiss, typical burger toppings) with the Rumbi fries (regular and sweet potato). The burger fell apart as most doubles do. He really enjoyed it though. Kids had the chicken dippers and the orange-honey chicken bowl. I was surprised that both kids polished their food off since dinnertime can be somewhat of a battle.  As we were finishing up it started to get busy so we got there at a good time (right before 6pm). I can't wait to go back.

What a great store. I've shopped here on and off for the past few years (not always this location), and have always found some great items. This last trip I was looking for a Secret Santa gift and sure enough, I found something, and then some.  The food section is great. Unfortunately, there were a lot of empty shelves on this last visit but I sill found some choice items. I really wanted some Beefy chips from England but they don't have them. No biggie...I scored some candy. Damn sweet tooth!!  Besides the pillows, candles, food, etc, one of the other great finds here are the stocking suffers. If you have kids and are looking for something outside of the everyday "dollar bin" stocking stuffer selection. Go here. I repeat, GO HERE.   Oh, and there's a rewards program like many other stores. Now shop on!

Hands down, best brewery in the East Valley! It's a pretty bold statement, but they win based on atmosphere. Indoor and outdoor seating (complete with bar seating)...some of the other outdoor patrons had their dogs with them. I don't have any pets but I can appreciate when a business allows others to allow them outside with their owners while enjoying a good meal and brews.  The food is awesome (pork enchiladas!!) and the menu has great variety. Burgers, tacos, sandwiches, pizza, mac and cheese, $5 kids meals...you're bound to find more than one thing that you want to order. Beers...yes please. I like the HopShock, but now Mr.Pineapple is out so we have been drinking that. If you can't make up your mind, you can't go wrong getting the sampler.  The location is great and parking has never really been a problem. The last time we were there I had to drive around a bit (Sunday afternoon) but we were able to find a spot on the way back around. I just wish we lived a little bit closer...but that could be dangerous since I would be here all.the.time.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile so when this last Tuesday rolled around and the kids wanted breakfast for dinner, we jumped in the car and headed to Black Bear. Kids eat free on Tuesday! Hooray!!  This place is super cute. On a Tuesday night it was busy but easy to get a table. I'm sure it's packed on weekend morning. They have a little retail area in the front with little stuffed bears, soaps, lotions, and bear claw back scratchers. We were seated right away and our server came right over to take our drink order.   The kids each had the mini volcano (two pancakes with an egg on top, sausage link, and bacon). (4.99/ea but both were free) I had the corned beef hash with red potatoes and a biscuit. (9.99, I think). My husband ordered the trout (not something that he would usually order but wanted something different), with mashed potatoes and vegetables. (8.49) They carry about three Bear Republic beers (bombers) so he ordered the black IPA not knowing how much they were going to charge. Get this. Only $5.45!!! Cheap!  The girls loved their breakfast dinner. It was a lot of food and they weren't able to finish it but they put a big dent in it. The pancakes? WOW! They were really good. Corned beef hash was really good. Small serving of corned beef, huge serving of potatoes. Biscuit was dry and inedible, probably because it was baked in the morning and I was eating it at 5:30pm. Hubby liked his food too.  We will be back, for sure. I'm getting the pancakes next time.

I'm thirsty, I want coffee, the doors were open...it was practically calling my name.  I walk in and panic sets in. I'm not familiar with the menu, one of my kiddos needs a napkin and is yanking on my pant leg, there's an annoying teenager in the corner yelling that he wants a Frappuccino (the barista suggests a similar drink for him trying to not show her obvious annoyance)...aaahhhhh!! I'm not prepared for this.  I get an iced tea. I didn't want an iced tea, I wanted coffee. I have a whole pitcher of iced tea in my fridge at home. Damn! It was good though.  I'll be back, next time for coffee. I won't let my lack of preparedness and shared annoyance with other patrons keep me away.

I had a hankerin for a bagel and this location is on my way home from my early morning drive to mesa and back, so I stopped one morning and kept returning. After an unfortunate incident last month though, I won't be coming back to this location.  My first couple experiences were fine. Not amazing but I got my order quick enough (sometimes correct, sometimes not) and the location was easy to get in and out. My last visit was just bizarre.  I placed my order with the cashier since there were only a couple customers in line and no one was working the order station on the opposite end. One of the employees was fiddling with the screen that shows the orders because it wasn't working correctly. I paid for my sandwich and waited...and waited...and waited...Another patron and I made small talk while watching the one sandwich maker fiddle with the screen some more. The assistant manager was cleaning the coffee equipment. Another employee came out to work the order station and gather bagels for customers who ordered boxes. One guy came from the back to fill the ice machine. Another employee proceeded to eat his food while clocking out for break. The cashier continued to stand around. The other patron and I continued to make small talk.  Silly me to think that the girl messing with the equipment will realize that people are waiting for food...I should have spoke up sooner. 13 minutes go by until I say something. "Sorry, we're having issues with the order screen". No shit - how about you start hand writing orders or communicating with the person taking them? Thank you for exhibiting zero problem solving skills.  Oh, and the assistant manager? Still cleaning the coffee equipment. No leadership whatsoever.  I can put up with incorrect orders, or waiting when it's busy, but I can't put up with lackluster customer service. I'll go out of my way to the 16th st and Camelback location when I have another bagel craving.

I don't think there is anything I can say that hasn't been said so I will keep this short and sweet.  Pros: Parking - I didn't know what to expect so we got here around opening on a weekday. The lot is a good size and there are some undercover spots. We parked with no problem but it might get packed on the weekend. Food -You can pack a lunch Attentive Staff - My daughter got a raunchy splinter in the tree house climbing thing. When I realized I didn't have band-aids I asked if they had first aid. The lady gave me one and then asked if my daughter would show her where it happened so she could check it out to make sure it was safe for other kids. Good size - Small enough to not be overwhelming but large enough so the kids won't get bored. Lockers - Near the entrance in case you don't want to tote all your stuff around. Culture Pass - Two free admissions if you are lucky enough to swoop up the culture pass at your local library.  Cons: I've got nothing  This is a fun place to spend an afternoon. It may not be as big as some other Children's Museums around the country but it was a hit with my five year old, and that's all that really matters to me. Parents, put down your cell phones, iPads, what have you, for the day and just watch your kid play...and play with them. Do an art project, draw pictures in the sand table, let them "make you a pizza", build a fort together, get lost in the noodle forest, just unplug and have fun. I promise it will be worth it.  Oh, and "Stroller Parking" and "Baby Only" areas are not suggestions. Please be respectful of all the other kiddos and parents who are trying to make some memories. Thanks...and have fun.

REI is quickly becoming my ultimate guilty pleasure. If I'm not walking through the front doors, I'm scouring the website for some sort of outdoor equipment that I MUST HAVE.   There are always tons of employees on the sales floor and everyone is super friendly. If you aren't asking someone for help, they'll track you down and making sure that you are aware they are there to answer any questions. Everyone who works there is an outdoor enthusiast of some type, whether it be camping, biking, backpacking, etc. If you are in need of specific help you are guaranteed to find someone who has knowledge in the area of expertise you need.  My girlfriend recently purchased a Columbia vest, only to have the seam rip a month later. Returns? No problem.  They didn't have her size in the store to exchange but they found one online and sent to our house.   When you checkout you have to opportunity to sign up for a membership. I *think* it's only $20 but don't quote me on that. You end up getting member only benefits, coupons, and a divided once a year based on how much you spend. There are also classes and don't forget the entry into the yard sale. Love REI. I really want to go shopping now.

My husband and I moved away from the area in 2007, when the Super Target was being built. When we found ourselves in the area last weekend, we wanted to see what all had changed, and this was at the top of our list. Surprisingly, we have never set foot in a Super Target so this was a first for us.   AHHHHHMAZING!   This place is huge. I knew it would be, but wow!! The grocery section is really what makes it "super" but the rest of the store is larger than your average Target. Some of the departments carried additional merchandise but it did seem like there was a lot of empty space. It's that time in the season where summer stuff starts to go on clearance to make room for the new items coming in so this could have contributed to that.  The grocery section is nice..not as abundant as your average supermarket of course, but they did have a decent selection. I normally wouldn't choose to buy produce and meat from a Target, but if I lived in the area I might consider buying from this one. There isn't an onsite butcher, all meat is prepacked (like a Trader Joe's) but there is an onsite Bakery and Prepared Foods area. Items were competitively priced, I didn't notice any great deals or anything that was overpriced. Einstein's Bagels has a self serve case in the bakery section, that that looked pretty sad. The other food aisles were well stocked and easy to shop.  Target, in general, is one of my favorite stores. As far as product, stores are consistent. At this location the prices are higher than my local store but that wouldn't stop me from coming here if I was in the area and needed to pick up some things. The store is really clean, employees are nice, and if I lived nearby I'm sure I would be here everyday. This store is a great upgrade from the one that was here 6 years ago.

I think I'm in love with SanTan Village. Not only is it just nice to walk around (and many seating areas if you rather just hang out and drink coffee, tea, etc), but there are a lot of restaurants and good shopping. If you are looking for a particular store, maybe look ahead and see off they are here, but if you just want a nice afternoon out with no agenda then this place is great. A little smaller than Tempe Marketplace but maybe a little higher end.

Went to my local Sprouts one night to find that it was closed. Weird, right? Something must have happened in the building. Anyway, I needed peaches (craving a peach cobbler) and they were on sale (.49/lb) so I drove to this location.   This store may be a little bit larger than the store on Gilbert Rd but laid out fairly similar. I was able to find other items that I needed to pick up with no problem. There were a lot of people working and everyone was very nice. I like how this location has the double decker shopping carts.   There was a lot of empty shelf space in some areas of the store. Not sure if they were actually out of a bunch of items or if someone just needed to get on top of stocking.   My cashier was nice and efficient.   I like this location but probably won't go out of my way to shop here but if I am near this location, I will probably change my route so I can be sure to stop here.

Tempe Beach Park is a great place to come spend the day. It's fairly large and easy to get around. There are some great paved paths for skating or bike riding, fishing, peddle boat rentals, and the splash park. This is just a handful of what the park has to offer.  The splash park is what we mainly come for. It can get pretty crowded but there are covered picnic tables in one area off the playground or there are some seats closer to the water...be prepared to get a little wet. There are a lot of great features for kids of all ages, and since there is only an inch of water or two in the "deepest" area, it's great for babies as well. I used to bring my seven year old here when she was a baby and I don't remember there being staff around, but when we came last weekend there was someone up by the slide to make sure that kids were taking turns and some other people were set up in the main water area.   Parking can be a challenge, especially on the weekend, but there is street parking nearby.   There is a ton of grass, and if you come prepared to have a bbq, there are some grills set up around the park. I have seen people bring their own as well but I'm not sure what the rules are regarding that.   If you plan on coming on a weekend or holiday, just double check that there aren't any special events going on.

Just your typical over-priced, weak service sandwich/salad chain. A lot of people behind the counter talking amongst themselves and starting at you blankly when they finally decide to help you.   My friend and I met here for a quick bite. She got a large salad and the mac and cheese kids meal. Paid over $18. The kids meal didn't even come with a drink, she had to get that separately.  Not a great experience. Next time I'll go to smashburger or the teriyaki place on the end.

I've been here twice and have had a decent experience both times. The menu is large with a lot of different choices and reasonably priced. Kids eat for .99 on Sundays which is always a good thing.  We went this past Sunday and were seated promptly. There were a lot of people dining but a good amount of open tables left. Our server came over quickly (do not recall his name) and took our drink order. When he came back to take our food order he came across like he was paying attention but got a few things wrong. Not usually a big deal if it's something that can be corrected, but he had to be reminded. When the manager came by to ask how everything was (toward the end of the meal) we let him know that the kid's meals were incorrect but they had eaten more than half. He offered free dessert but we were stuffed.  I ordered the pollo fundidto and it was alright. The cream cheese didn't have much spice like I expected it to. My husband was happy with his fish tacos and his mom loved the carnitas tacos. The chips, salsa, and bean dip prior to the meal was good and of course I made the mistake of eating too much.   I love that Garcia's is just down the street so we will definitely be back...but probably just on Sundays.

Driven by here a million times, wish I would have gone in sooner. Now that I have, this will most likely become my go to coffee place.  First of all, LOVE the patio. Tons of seating options, some with tables if you are eating, some without if you are just enjoying your coffee. Tons of shade and misters running along the side to keep you cool.  Inside the coffee house is fairly small but there is some seating if you don't really want to be outdoors. When we arrived there were some patrons sitting at the counter and some others at the tables on their computers. There were no other customers ahead of us waiting to order but we didn't feel rushed to order. I always peruse the menu when I go into a new coffee shop even though I usually order the same thing. Our drinks came out quick and were good. My husband didn't really like his but that wasn't the fault of Bergies. My husband just misinterpreted what the owner said.   If I lived within walking distance, I would be here everyday (I actually started looking for houses in the area and this was one of the reasons) but since I'm not (yet!) I will have to settle with stopping by whenever I am driving through Gilbert.  Oh...and there is a check in offer for 50% off your first drink.

I started using Origins products a couple months ago and have been happy with just about everything I have used. I have very sensitive skin and have received great recommendations from the staff.   The store recently went through a remodel and is super clean and incredibly easy to shop. Each wall section is organized in a way that makes sense and is easy to shop. They even have a wall of samples to the left and behind the registers. If you want to sample something that doesn't come in a little packet, the employees will be happy to put together a little container for you.  I've only had one experience that didn't meet my expectations and that's only because I felt rushed. I like to walk into a store and browse on my own, but on this particular day I was pushed to the register as soon as I told the sales woman what I was looking for. Probably a good thing though...I'm sure I saved some money that day.

I love coming to Pro's, both to shop and to just grab a quick bite. my kids like to watch the tortilla machine and refer to this place as, "the store with the things on the fans".  Produce is relatively cheap although I have seen a lot of rotten items because it's being stocked quickly and not very carefully. The bakery is awesome but the self serve case can be hit and miss. Yesterday it was full of goodies but I have been there around the same time in the past and it was shopped down. I just noticed yesterday that the juice bar also has bulk salsa on one side, and it's a good price. I am kicking myself for not buying some salsa verde. Next time, I guess.  It gets pretty busy and lines are usually long, but don't let it intimidate you. The lines get through pretty quickly and everyone is super nice. I've never been to a Food City and after coming here, I have no need to go. This place is great.

I love Cheba Hut (Tempe), but I don't find myself out there too often. Now that I am in Phoenix, and was over on this side for lunch, I was pretty excited to see there was a Cheba Hut nearby. I had a serious craving.  It was noon on a weekday and it was dead. Apparently this location gets super busy when school is in session, so being able to get right in and order was pure luck. My old stand-by is no longer on the menu (AZ Homegrown) so I went with my second favorite, Jamaican Red (add cream cheese). The guy who took my order was friendly and let me know there would be an additional charge for the cream cheese, which I was aware of but appreciate when you are given a heads up.  I got my drink (kool-aid....OH YEAH!), and waited for my sandwich....and waited...and waited....and waited...and waited some more....and, oh yay! Here is is! Finally!!!  First glance, pure disappointment. It was so bready. Toppings were scarce, even though I got everything on it. The chicken wasn't saucy like I'm accustomed to. In fact, it just seemed like plain chicken with some thin buffalo sauce squirted over the top. It wasn't very spicy but I was starving so I powered my way through it, even though the toasty bread tore up the roof of my mouth.  It sucks when you are looking forward to something that you know is so good but ends up being so bad. I'll give this location the benefit of the doubt and just hope I wandered in on an off day. Next time I'll just order something else.

I had heard about Total Wine from numerous people but have never lived close to one. When I spotted it on my way to IKEA one day, I knew I had to check it out. A couple weeks later after a family trip to IKEA, we decided to stop by.  As soon as we walked in we were greeted. There was a lot of staff on the floor so it was easy to find someone to ask a question, but there wasn't someone around every corner asking if you needed help with anything. Browsing is encouraged, which is nice. My husband has been looking around forever for a "turtle" so he can make his Black Velvets easily but the three or four people he asked had no idea what it was. (He finally ordered it off Amazon)  I found a wine that I LOVE and am unable to find anywhere outside of Washington State (Chateau Ste. Michelle Dry Riesling). The beer selection is awesome and they offer singles if you are into mixing your six packs. I wish I was more prepared and had an empty growler with me because they do growler fills as well.  My girls were thirsty and I couldn't find a water fountain (it's over by the bathroom, of course, as I later found out) so I bought a bottle of water off the shelf. The cashier told me that I could put it in their chiller if I wanted it cold. That was pretty cool.  After reading a bunch of reviews, fellow yelpers keep saying that this place is way better then BevMo, which I have never been to but now need to check out. I'm sure this will continue to be our brewsky shopping destination when we are in the area.

Good menu. Friendly service. I usually use the drive thru and have always had a good experience. The speaker isn't the best so if that's a deal breaker for you, it's best to go inside. They are always super staffed and The wait has always been short, inside and out.

Adorable little ice cream shop, nestled in the historic district of Glendale. We wanted to take the kids somewhere outside of your average fro yo shop and happened across this little gem on yelp.  We pulled up at 6:13pm and the sign was still outside, however the hours posted said that they closed at 6pm. As we approached, the owner was outside watering the flowers and she waved us in, happy to serve us even though she had closed for the night.  The girls each ordered rainbow sherbet in a cup, I had the strawberries and cream in a sugar cone, and my girlfriend had the butter pecan in a waffle cone. Waffle cones are made in house, and everyone was satisfied with their choice. The total came to $9 and some change (after using the 20% off a regular cone check-in offer, of course).  This is definitely one of those places that I will go out of my way to visit again because the overall experience went above and beyond my expectations. I can't wait to return.

Came here looking for some prizes for something that we have to put together for my daughter's school carnival. I thought it would be like your neighborhood Dollar Tree but I was mistaken. This place is pretty big, pretty messy, and downright disgusting.  I didn't make it up and down every aisle since I was trying to find only one or two things. From the looks of it, at least 1/3 of the store is food. I saw a lot of employees stocking shelves. They also have a lot of cheap art and school supplies, kitchen items, even single pairs of ladies undergarments hanging on hangers.  Yeah...I won't be back.

I was a little apprehensive going into my first ever car buying experience. All you hear are horror stories from other people about their experiences, and then you tack on the fact that I have NO credit, so I was pretty sure I wasn't going to find anyone who wanted to sell me a car.  That was definitely not the case.  On an early Saturday afternoon, my husband and I went in to look at a Tucson and a Santa Fe. We had done our research online and wanted to see them in person. I wasn't ready to purchase that day and when I told our salesman that, he took me out for a couple test drives and left it at that. I told him I would be back the following week.  I went back in on Tuesday and Mr. Bob was available and ready to talk to me about the decision that my husband and I made. We decided on a Santa Fe so we walked the lot looking for the color that I wanted with the right options. We found a 2014 in the back. Took it out for another test drive, came back and worked on getting me into it at the down payment and monthly payment that I wanted to spend. Four hours later (maybe a little less), I walked out of there with a brand new car and an appointment to get my windows tinted the next day. No haggling, no negotiating, easy deal.  Everyone I met with was super friendly and I would recommend this dealership to anyone. Thanks for the great experience. I will be back for a second car soon.

My car decided not to start at one point yesterday so I took it to AutoZone today to get the battery checked out. I didn't have to wait, he came right out and tested it, told me I had a bad battery, and got me all set up with a new one. Even installed it and got rid of the old one. When he was installing it I asked it he could check my alternator. He did, said it was really good so it was definitely my battery. Unfortunately it was an unexpected expense that I didn't really need right now, but lucky that it was painless and quick.

I came here on a Saturday afternoon so we were able to pull right up to the window. I'm sure this location can get pretty busy on a weekday morning, but the direction of the drive-thru doesn't seem obnoxious and can probably accommodate a lot of cars.   The staff was friendly and told us about some deals that they were having later in the week while I perused the menu board. For a coffee joint, there is a lot to choose from and for a drive-up, reading the board is obnoxious. I usually just go with my old standby iced coffee but thought I wanted to try something new. Luckily a line didn't form behind us.  As the baristas were making our drinks, one let another know a drink to get ready for the car that was now behind us. That's pretty cool that they remember their regulars.  I will def be back, but next time I might just go to the walk up until I have the menu memorized.

I've been a loyal t-mobile customer for almost 10 years so when my last two year contract was up, I knew I would sign another and upgrade my phone.  I put off the upgrade for a few months because we were in the midst of planning a cross country move. When we were settled I just happened across this location and decided to go in.  I want sure what phone I wanted (my previous upgrade experience was less than stellar and I was expecting to pay a lot) and the girl who was helping me walked me through all my choices. She was patient even when my daughter started asking when we would be done over and over and over.  I settled on the galaxy s 2, got it for even less than what the girl thought I was going to have to pay, but I did have to change my plan because the sweet unlimited plan that I was so lucky to hold on to for the past 8 years or so was no longer compatible.  Service was fast, staff was friendly, I only knocked down one star because they were lacking in the accessories department.   Oh, and this location is great for people watching. In the short amount of time we were in there, I got to witness some interesting interactions. All the other guys who were working never missed a beat.

If I were going to this park just to get my disc golf on, I would probably give it a solid four stars. My first, and only trip thus far did include the kids, who wanted to do more than disc golf, so my rating is lower.  Conocido Park is located in a neighborhood away from 35th ave and is easily accessible. The parking lot is located by the playground and is small, but there is street parking. I don't see this place getting crazy busy though. I didn't notice any restrooms but there is a water fountain and the water was ice cold. There are a number of picnic tables and benches, a couple close to the playground and some on the disc golf course. The play structures are covered (the large one anyway) and its surrounded by sand.  So, why the two stars? The playground equipment. I get it, parks departments are strapped for cash, just like everyone else, but on the big climbing structure there were, I believe, 4 gates chained up because of broken equipment (thus preventing kids from using it so they don't hurt themselves). While I do appreciate someone taking the time to put the gates there so kids won't fall out of random gaps in the equipment or cut themselves on a jagged slide, at what point do you scrap what's there and start over? Three of the four slides were unusable and the monkey bars were missing. It seems as if the children there were still having fun, but what was usable was very limited.   I hope that this park has made a list somewhere for the city of Phoenix to fix up. I'd love to bring the kids back want to ensure they will be safe while playing.

Meh...I don't know why I keep going to Cold Stone. I don't like it, never have, never will.  It was pretty busy when I brought my kids over the weekend. There was a good sized line (not quite out the door but headed that way). There were about 5 teens working behind the counter. At one point only one was working, the other four were just talking to each other.  The ice cream is gross, over-priced, and the service had little to be desired. If my kids didn't want ice cream NOW, I would have convinced them to go elsewhere. At least I now know there's a yogurt place in Tempe Marketplace...I'll be sure to check that out next time.

A friend once told my husband and I that Short Leash has the best for dogs in Phoenix, but the line was crazy long when we saw the truck at the Phoenix local fest, so we passed.  No line at 10am at the Gilbert Farmer's Market...yes please!!  I ordered the Lady. My husband ordered the Aiko. We both got the all beef dog. Freaking AMAZING!!!! The only complaint is that my husband expected more toppings (cilantro, red onion), but instead thought the little bit there was had been mixed in to the mango chutney. We also ordered two kids corndogs. At $3 each they were a little pricey. The kids liked them but picked the batter off.  I still give them five stars. Can't wait to catch them around town again.

Unfortunately my love for DD has been on a steady decline in the last year. Every once in awhile I'll try to reel it back in, only to end up disappointed once again. I order the same iced coffee every time, and every time it is bad. Always thin, watered down, no flavor whatsoever. At least they have consistency going for them.

My husband suggested coming here when we started talking about getting bikes. I was pretty excited to check it out. There was a sign in the front starting something to the effect that their bike inventory changes daily. I must have caught them on an off day. Oh well, more reason to go back.  Tons of office equipment...chairs, huge desks, filling cabinets. They had a lot of computer monitors and some new in box printers. I don't know a thing about computers but I wouldn't really trust buying one from here. That's just me though.  If you buy something and don't have the means to get it home you have 7 days to pick it up, which is nice. They also have auctions.

Love the Gilbert farmers market. LOVE IT!!  We stumbled upon it during our 45 minute wait for The Farmhouse while on vacation last year. There were so many vendors and everything looked so good. When we moved here late last year, I was happy we got a place so close.  Pros: Great produce at multiple stands. Tons of samples. Entertaining for the kids. I always leave with something I didn't intend to buy.  Cons: I wish it ran later than noon.

5 stars for cold brew 4 stars for friendliness 2 stars for drive-thru  I have yet to go inside or order food, but based on my total drive-thru experience, I'd give 32 Shea a solid 4 stars. Everyone who I have encountered is upbeat and friendly, my coffee is always awesome, and if I hit it just right, the drive-thru is quick and painless.   32 Shea was suggested to me countless times since I drop my kids off at school up the street everyday. After waking up one morning and deciding that I was done with my usual Starbucks routine I figured I would give them a try. I pulled up to the drive thru and it was four cars deep. Not a big deal one would usually think, but when you are someone who orders food and need to pull forward with nowhere to go, it gets a little tricky. Thankfully I got my coffee and only had to wait a few minutes for the other cars in front of me to be on their way. I almost didn't give this place another shot after that, but I'm glad I did. Every other experience has been much quicker.  Be sure to ask for a punch card. Buy 10 coffees or teas, get one free.

Nothing beats sitting in the lawn on a sunny day, drinking beers, letting the kids run around, and watching some baseball. And being able to do that at a great ballpark, even better!  Came here for the Spring Training Dbacks opener. It was awesome. A lot of people but you didn't feel all smooshed. Everyone in our general vicinity in the lawn was pretty cool and didn't get upset when my girls let their own baseballs get away from them a couple times. Baxter even came out and the girls left with their first ever autographs. Awesome!!  Bathrooms are clean (BEER SHELVES?!?!). Parking was cheap ($5) and it was easy in and easy out. I missed the turn off Via de Ventura into the lot my first go around. Will call window was a little more confusing than it should have been but that was no problem.   If you have the time and are on the hunt for beer, be sure to walk the whole perimeter inside the park. There are a lot of little stands that sell only one or two beers that aren't sold at other stands.   Oh, and if you are like me and have two little ones with you that want ice cream...DON'T let them convince you that they each need their own from Coldstone. Mine did, which resulted in two HUGE cups of birthday cake ice cream melting in the sun.  Play Ball!!

Decided that I should probably get my Arizona license since I moved here almost a year ago, so I stopped by on a weekday afternoon around lunch. Licensing was down (first day of the government shut down. Not sure if this was one of the things affected or if it was coincidental). The lady that helped me at the front was incredibly nice and gave me my application to come back later. The building was clean and they had a lot of people working. I'll be back.

Churn is always a perfect ending....whether you just stuffed your face across the street at Federal Pizza (like we did yesterday), while you are winding down after an amazing day, or if you really just want ice cream.  I wanted to try something new so I had the coconut lime sorbet. It was refreshing and a little tart. Just about perfect. The kids each had a kids cone, which come with a fun little ring. Hubby had two scoops, one of which was a half scoop of two different flavors since he couldn't make up his mind (double chocolate, peanut butter, and banana...YUM!).    We redeemed one of our punch cards (buy 5, get 1 free....awesome deal) and the total came to $10. Next time I am going to get an ice cream sandwich (your choice of ice cream in between two cookies for $4).  In addition to the wonderful ice cream, the nostalgic candy and toys are also a great find. Last Christmas I picked up a bunch of stocking stuffers here and I know this will me my go to place again this year. Let's just hope I make it back there before then.

Four words...White chocolate covered strawberry. YUM!!!  I went with a group of friends and everyone was really happy with the frozen yogurt flavors. Another yelper said that they have similar tastes, which I agree with. I tried the coconut which had good flavor. Had I not known what it was I would have possibly thought it was oatmeal cookie.  The topping bar was really clean and they have a good variety. I like how the cheesecake bites (my favorite) and the funfetti bites come in individual containers instead of getting smashed in the larger container with the spoon.   Very clean, decent amount of seating, and less expensive than I anticipated. This place will not disappoint. Ask for a punch card...the cashier didn't automatically give me one but did once I asked.

Came here with some vegetarian friends that suggested it and had great experiences in the past. We were excited to check it out.  I had the picnic salad and samosas. Hubby had the po boy, girls had the nuggs. All was very good. The Tamarind sauce with the samosas was a little sweet so I stress them without it. Great flavor.  We were able to get a seat easily (Sunday afternoon), but when I pulled into the parking lot and got the last spot, I have to admit I was scared for a second. Especially because we were a party of 8. The bathroom was pretty cool.  Ooh..and the buffalo wings....bomb!

I got hooked on DD coffee when we lived in Philadelphia...they were everywhere, it was cheap, and the staff got to know my drink after a few visits so it was just easy. We decided to move to Arizona and low and behold, there's a Dunkin right up the street!! Booyah!!  I have to admit, I was expecting to be disappointed. When we came out here for vacation last year, we tried a couple DD (Scottsdale Rd and another on Hayden) and they put way too much flavored syrup in my iced coffee. Turns out they didn't have the special machine that measures everything correctly at the push of a button. I *think* the location on brown does. Score!  The manager took our Philly punch cards (extra customer service points) and they are always friendly when I go in. Yeah, our drinks have been messed up a few times but that happens anywhere. It doesn't bug me. They don't have my drink memorized yet, but I don't go everyday anymore.  Not a five star because they have a minimum of two munchkin rule. Not a huge deal but when I have only one of my kids and I'm scrounging up change in my purse or the car, it sucks when I don't have enough. I have learned my lesson though and always go prepared.

I feel a little silly reviewing a Safeway, but there is something about this store that I love. Maybe it's because it reminds me of grocery shopping with my mom every week when I was little...I don't know.  I haven't shopped in a large supermarket for quite some time but since we moved nearby it's just more convenient. Prices are pretty good and I have the Safeway app so for additional savings (you can add Web coupons to your shopper card).   This location is never busy so they usually only have one or two lanes open. Sometimes that can get backed up but I have never waited more than 5 minutes.

Sorry Safeway...after my experience today I have to deduct some stars.  I ran in to pick up a couple items. I know what I need and don't want a doing cart. Where are all the flippin' baskets? None at the entrance I came in at, none at the registers, none on the other side of the store. Are you powerwashing them (all at once)? More than likely you have gotten rid of them so your shoppers get a cart and end up putting more in their baskets (the old "larger shopping basket" scheme). Well, well, well Safeway...your plan backfired and I bought less than I intended, just because I didn't want a damn cart.  Hope to see those baskets back again soon.

What a cool concept. My friend had a Groupon so we decided to give it a try...figured it wouldn't hurt. Upon first impression it was super clean. It's in a building with a couple other establishments and parking was easy.  We decided to share three rolls and the seaweed salad. We ordered the spicy tuna, five alarm, and philly roll. It's like a Subway for sushi...the seaweed or soy wrap is made ahead of time with whatever rice you choose (white or brown). It doesn't take long for the "sushi artists" to put the rolls together. Then they put it in a sushi cutter type contraption and you get 10 equal sized pieces. When we were about to ring up we decided to all the grilled chicken roll to our order (don't remember the exact name). We each got a beer and the total came to just over $20 but remember, we had a Groupon. The full prices for each of the rolls was about $8-$9 and the beer was $4. You can also make your own roll...seaweed is $4 and soy wrap is $5 and you get a choice of 3 fruits or veggies, protein extra.  All of the rolls were really good...I think the chicken was my favorite. My friend thought that the spicy tuna tasted like lipstick but I couldn't really tell. Everything was fresh. We ate everything but were stuffed...we didn't really need that fourth roll but were happy we got it.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for something casual, inexpensive, and good.

Carne asada tacos at $1.00 a pop. Yes!!! Steak, cabbage, hot sauce, sour cream if you ask for it. Best street tacos around.   The line is (usually) long but it's so worth it. On any given weekend night you will find bar goers, families, people just getting off work, all lined up for some taco truck amazing-ness. The burritos are huge, the nachos look amazing, the quesadillas are always a good stand by, but the tacos....oh the tacos.   Take my advice...don't be put off by the line but be prepared to wait. You can thank me later.

I thought about stopping by last week after doing a yelp search and seeing the overall rating. Two days later I got a coupon in the mail and knew it was meant to be.  I pulled up and instantly the guy was trying to upsell me. Fine, I'll get the 27.99 wash that's guaranteed for seven days. Then he proceeded to try to sell me on their oil change services...noticed my car was new and wanted me to think of them when I need my maintenance done. They include a free car wash, you know. Sigh, I prepaid at the dealership thankyouverymuch. End of discussion.  The girl working behind the desk was nice. She rang me up, took the best coupon, and later rang me up real quick because I forgot money for a tip. They can do up to $5 on your card.  The car wash was good, but as for the inside detailing, I'm way less than impressed. Most of three dead bugs were eliminated from my windshield (hooray!!), with a couple minor exceptions, but that should have been caught by Mr. detail expert. The inside was wiped down, but not the dash. The "pina colada" scent was non-existant (don't really care), and there are areas on the inside of the doors and cup holders where there is greasy residue from the cleaner. I hate to base the majority of my overall rating on the detailing alone, but I feel that's what you pay for and the majority of the time is spent on that.  (sidebar...this is my first review from my phone so if there are typos, I apologize. I tried to correct them all as I was Swyping)

My girls love coming here. They have a good selection of yogurt flavors and pretty good selection of mix-ins. If you have a punch card from another yogurt place, they will match it in punches, up to 5, if you turn it in.   Zoyo is always REALLY clean and the staff is friendly. Looking forward to going again.

I love the idea of a BBQ festival and was so excited, but this one wasn't executed well at all. I read the reviews from last year ahead of time and had high hopes that some of the kinks would have been worked out. Not so.  I hate the "ticket" system. Stand on one line just to get tickets so you can then stand in another line to get food. The ticket booth outside the gate is the only one that will take a card (lines here were way shorter than the booth inside). Some vendors accept cash but it's not consistent. A ticket is worth $2 and most vendors have the dollar amount and ticket amount listed on their menu, but I did notice one (can't remember the name) that had a sandwich listed as $3 (2 tickets). Seriously...get rid of the ticket system. It's too much of a headache.  The kids area was fun, until it got too hot and the inflatables were burning children. An unlimited wristband was $15 or tickets were $1 each. Half way through the day the guys manning the inflatables just kind of gave up and stopped taking tickets or checking wristbands. (To be fair, it might not have been all of them but I did witness about 4 or so doing this).  There was no shade, no mister system, crazy long lines...such a disappointment. In hindsight, maybe the $60 VIP ticket would have been a better choice because the amount of money I spent was a waste. Wishing we stuck with our original plans to go to the Four Peaks Fest instead.

I have died and gone to froyo heaven! Twirl is AMAZING and my new yogurt spot.  I've only been twice so far, and have the coconut and the peanut butter yogurts. Both were very good and tasted exactly like they should without being too sweet or tart. There is a wide selection of toppings, including fruit, candies, and sauces...there is even hot fudge and hot caramel (my favorite!!!!).   The shop is super clean, customer service is excellent, and parking is usually pretty easy.

My favorite store!! The first time I stepped foot in here, I fell in love.   This store is full of paper and card making supplies, craft supplies, stamps, markers, photo albums, cards, and gifts. Anytime I go in here I feel like I am stepping back into my scrap booking days. The single sheets of paper are a great deal, whether you need gift wrap for a small gift and don't want to deal with a bunch of excess left over, or if you need some for a craft. They seem to have it all.  I especially love this store for gifts. They have an excellent selection of journals and calendars, as well as kitchenware, housewares, and other unique items. My favorite days are when the new catalog arrives in the mail.   Right now, the only location in The Phoenix area is at Scottsdale Quarter, but there is a new location opening up at Town & Country...has to be any time now. The staff is super friendly, helpful, and creative at the Scottsdale Quarter location, but the new store is the one I will frequent most since I work practically next door. I have no doubt the staff will be just as amazing at the new store.

Can my review consist only of row after row of heart emojis?  No? Darn. Alright then.  Oh Vovomeena. I came for the coffee, I stayed for the breakfast. I saw the cold brew flights on yelp so this easily became a weekend destination. Unfortunately I work most weekend mornings but finally had the opportunity to stop by this previous weekend.  I ordered the waffle with bacon and potatoes. You have NO idea how happy I am that there is a place that offers a breakfast dish with no eggs. I'm not the biggest breakfast fan (because I despise eggs), and unless you feel the same way you don't realize how they are in just about every breakfast dish. Aaaannnyyyyyway, my waffle was awesome (with strawberry jam because I can't stand maple syrup either) and my bacon and potatoes were good too. Got a Portugese donut, because duh, and I was super full after that.  My cold brew flight was good. They use Roastery of Cave Creek coffee which is excellent coffee. This flight consisted of the Black & Tan (a Roc2 roast), vanilla coco-something (vanilla bean and cocoa nibs), and lemon jalapeño. The first two, yes. The last one....not for me. We chatted with the barista when we were leaving about the brewing system they use, as well as espresso drinks. He was very knowledgable and came across somewhat passionate about coffee.  The only downside was that on a Saturday morning, it was a little difficult to relax while eating. It gets pretty crowded and they are quick to clear your table after you have taken your last bite. Service is quick though, and we had no issue getting a table.  We'll be back, for sure.

Living on the East Coast, I always thought, "Ugh, why can't Rita's be open year round?". Then when we moved back to Arizona I thought, "Ugh, why can't I bring Rita's with me?". Low and behold...THERE"S NOW RITA'S IN ARIZONA AND IT'S OPEN ALL YEAR!!!! (I was seriously that excited. No joke.)  I came to this location on the first day of Spring for the first time. Booyah, free water ice!!! (I've also figured out that I am the only person that I know that says "water ice") I wasn't aware that this location was as new as it is so I was expecting it to be packed at opening. I guess this was the first "First Day of Spring" this location has had so I was first in line. My first experience was okay but I didn't want to base my review off of that day...opened late, workers not super friendly (hungover maybe?), water ice not completely stocked. Rita's did not bring their A-game on this visit. But it was free and it was good.  I came for the second time a few days later. Even less flavors on this trip. There was a girl training and she was the nicest out of the bunch. Service, not including the new girl, was about the same. I used to have a boss that said that if "Rita's" was on an applicants resume, she would interview them because they always have the best service. Standards for Rita's must be higher in Philadelphia. Just sayin',  I love Rita's so much that I am willing to look bast the sub-par service and lack of flavors and give this location 4 stars anyway. I will go out of my way to keep coming back.  Oh, and another thing...they now have these virtual punch cards. It's a nice concept, I guess, but with the paper cards you used to get one punch per item that you bought. Now no matter how much you purchase, you only get one punch per visit. Dumb.

I decided to come in around lunch time on a Tuesday afternoon. As I was entering, a couple of businessmen were leaving and talking about how busy it gets because of their specials. I knew what they meant when I saw the line but I figured it must move quickly, so I decided to wait...it was lunch after all and a place being jam packed at that time is generally a good sign.  The special on Tuesday was tacos for $1.75...beef, chicken, or pork. I ordered one pork and and one beef. With rice, beans, and a drink, my total came to just over $5. Not bad at all. The beef was really good, the pork a little disappointing. Too sweet for my taste. I was happy with the rice and beans and the horchatta hit the spot. Oh..and the TORTILLAS!! Best part of the meal.   I ordered my food to go and took it back to work to eat. In the end I exhausted almost my whole lunch break (I was gone for 25 minutes). You can send your order in ahead of time online so you don't have to wait. That may be the way to go for someone who has a short lunch break. I may try that next time.

I've been to this location twice. Once to get a Halloween costume for my oldest, two days before Halloween, and one today to pick up some party favors.  The Halloween trip was....fun? It was crowded and annoying, but given the timeframe I didn't expect anything less. We looked at all the pictures on the wall just like everyone else and I've my daughter decided on a costume we asked one of the associates working the floor. They got it from the back quickly and we were able to try it on. The experience was relatively pain free and quick. They have a large selection and although sizes were limited, they had more than expected.  Today I went to get some favors for my daughter birthday party. She wanted a Monster High theme, and after searching Pinterest I found that Party City had a lot to choose from. I went to the website first and sure enough, it looked like I would find a large selection. I was able to get some fun favors and party hats for just over $40. They also had some "value packs" that would have been less.  The store is a little dirty, but it's very well organized and they have a lot of themes and characters to choose from. Had I not checked Pinterest, chances are I wouldn't have thought of going here...silly, I know. I have another party to plan for next month and I will be back here for sure.

I have never belonged to a gym (or really ever been in one unless you count the YMCA when I was 16) so I came with a friend to check it out. We came on a Saturday morning and it was pretty empty. There were four staff members behind the counter which seemed a little excessive but they were friendly and seemed to recognize my friend.   The facility is super clean and there are tons of machines. For never being in a gym I was immediately put at ease and felt comfortable. It was nice to have a friend show me around and was patient so I could read the instructions on all of the machines before I used them. I didn't see any staff walking around of talking to the patrons but I believe you can ask if you need assistance.   I have been thinking of going to the gym EVERYDAY since I have been and am going back to sign up in the next couple of days. I can see myself becoming addicted to going here so watch out current Duke or Duchess...I'm coming for that top spot.

Came in for free coffee day. Who says no to free coffee? Well anyway, I only drink it iced so I had to pay $1. No biggie, I got two. The kids wanted some donuts so I picked up a few. It's been years since I have had an original glazed. It was alright. This location doesn't have the full frying/glazing contraption that I have seen at other locations. They must come in frozen.  If you need to use the restroom, be sure to ask for the key from the front. Understandable given the location.

I've been here a couple times. Once before a game, and once after. I've really only had drinks, although the first time I went I was meeting my husband and his friend and they had a plate of nachos. By the time I got to it, it had been sitting for awhile so I don't think you want my review on those. I was in time for happy hour though. YAY!!  The second time I came was last Sunday. The Dbacks game had just finished and I had a couple hours to kill before my friend was picking me up so we could head to another event. The rest of my family was heading home via the light rail, so it was up to me to find some air conditioning and kill some time. I decided to walk to a different establishment that I had not yet been to, but by the time I got there it had already closed (wrong hours listed on the yelp page, so I submitted an edit). Decided to backtrack to Legends because I knew where it was and needed a beer.  When I arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't too packed. Easily found a seat at the end of the bar. The bartender was friendly even though I was a sweaty mess. He got me a glass of water and my Hop Knot (a tall one). After finishing it I ordered another, but a pint. The tall was $6, the pint was $5. I should have just gotten another tall.  With two good experiences, I'm sure this will become the regular pregame hangout. I don't recall the happy hour times or specials but that's just an added bonus. They are also kid friendly, so that's another plus.

Two days in a row!! Two!! Good service, nice decor, excellent food, FREAKING AMAZING Bloody Mary's....I've found a new breakfast spot in Gilbert!!  Our first visit was a day date for the hubs and I. He had been wanting to check this place out but thought the only one that existed was in Arcadia. I mentioned I had driven by the one on Warner and since we had other plans in Tempe that day, we decided to check it out. We arrived around 9:30am on a Friday and were promptly seated. During our time there, an hour or so, it really filled up.  I ordered the chiliquilles. I asked our server what he recommended between those and the corned beef hash. The serving was large and I filed up quickly. The chips stayed crunchy through the whole meal...nothing worse than soggy chips. Blech!   Not wanting to get loaded first thing in the morning (and therefore sleepy), we chose to split a Mary's en Fuego. Jalapeno vodka, Bloody Mary mix, bacon bits, Old Bay rim. YUM! It was spicy and so, so good. Highly recommended.  On the next visit we brought the kids.  They loved their pancakes. This time I went with the corned beef hash. Meh. Small portion and not a lot of flavor. The chiliquilles is where it's at. Oh...and another Bloody Mary.

I've been to this location a handful of times. Usually it's pretty quick, in and out, but yesterday there was a huge line and a long wait. I am going to write it off as a fluke though...maybe an employee called out. Luckily I wasn't in a rush and I waited it out.  I always get the same thing, and have had issues with other DDs not making my drink the way I like it (see other DD reviews). I'm happy to say that from day 1, this location has it down and it's consistent every time. Thank you!

Anyone remember the Way to Play Cafe that was in Chandler? This place is 10 times better.  My friend had free passes so we decided to check it out. I read the other review on yelp before coming so I was expecting to be disappointed. Fortunately, that was not the case. All three of the kids we brought (she's 5, 4, and 1) had a blast. There is a padded play area for the babies with a ton of toys. In the corner there is a diaper changing area and a private nursing corner. The rest of the play are is pretty big. The floor is Astroturf (but soft). There is a large climbing structure with disk swings, punching bags, handlebars to swing on, and a tube slide. Then there are a good amount of toys, sprinkle for all ages. We were there for about for hours and our kids never for bored...they were even upset when we had to leave.  The staff was amazing!! Not only did everyone take some time to come talk to us, but we were given honest information on buying memberships (try a month our three months first, just to see how often you come), info about birthday parties, a tour, and friendly conversation. There is someone in the play area at all times monitoring the kids...they even call the kids by name.   The service was great, the staff was awesome, and the food was good too. We checked in on yelp and got a bogo lunch deal!   We'll be back for sure. We had a great time!

There is a play area for little kids right next to the play structure for the bigger kids. They have swings for both as well. Neither are covered though and there isn't really any shade. There is an elementary school next door that has covers over their outdoor toys.  There is a big soccer field, basketball court, volleyball court, and horseshoe pits. There is a sidewalk that goes around...I haven't followed it around but I have seen kids riding backs and others walking with their dogs.  There is ample seating throughout the park as well as three covered seating areas, two right next to the playgrounds.  No bathrooms.

One of the worst things about moving to a new area has to be establishing relationships with new doctors, dentists, etc. A friend referred me to Kidtastic because she really likes the dentists and they are great with her daughter who is terrified of going. Luckily I don't have that problem, my kids LOVE the dentist even though they have had a ton of dental work.  The office is small but very kid friendly, of course. There is a tv showing a movie and a couple video games for the kids to play while they wait. When the kids were done with their appointment they got a water bottle and a token to get a toy out of the machine. Cute.  I felt like the dentist really took his time with each girl and didn't rush through the exam. Our previous offices were HUGE, with tons of chairs in a line and they were in and out. Not here. They really took the time and asked if I had any concerns and answered questions that I had.   I would definitely recommend this office to anyone looking for a pediatric dentist. The receptionists are incredibly helpful. I called on a Thursday just to see if they accepted my insurance and when they confirmed they did, they got all of my information and got the kids scheduled that following Monday.

Since writing my original review, there has been a steady decline in professionalism every six months. Even as I sit here in the waiting room writing this, I am tempted to get up and leave.   The desk staff is hit or miss. Some days they are friendly, others not so much. I had a previous issue and had called a couple times to follow up. I was told it would be looked in to yet never received a call back.   At the last appointment where my youngest was having some gum pain, the dental assistant was rude and had a poor bedside manner. She seemed to lack patience with having to take some x Rays. Something about that situation made me feel uneasy.   After this appointment, we won't be returning.

Cute park. Covered playground with sand. Bathrooms. Basketball and volleyball courts. Covered picnic benches. Baseball fields.   This park is fairly large with a couple different parking lots. I guess there is a dog park area somewhere but I didn't see it.

My girlfriend and I were seated right away on a Friday night around 6:30pm. We opted to sit outside on the patio. One section was reserved for a large party so I was surprised that we were able to get a table so quick. Inside was pretty packed and there was some live music going on near the entrance.  Our server was very attentive and gave a lot of great suggestions. We ordered a carafe of sangria (red) which was $18. Excellent deal. We probably got about 4 glasses out of it as the ice melted, but it never tasted watered down. Fruity but not too sweet.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas and she ordered the pork burrito. We both had black beans and rice. The enchiladas come flat, in a cast iron skillet. My dish was perfect - saucy, just enough spice, consistent cheese all of the way through. The rice was a little more wet than I prefer but my dinner date enjoyed it. She ordered her burrito enchilada style with green sauce. The only downside was that the pork was a little too salty but she enjoyed it anyway.  Drinks, two entrees, complimentary chips and salsa (awesome salsa, btw) - $45. There is a window near the courtyard for tacos and possibly some other easy options which I want to check out. We'll definitely be back.

Great Starbucks whether you go through the drive thru or inside. I stop by every morning (drive thru). Service is quick and the employees are all really nice. My order has always been correct.  The inside is spacious and there is a nice sized patio. It's always been real clean anytime I have been inside and even if there are a lot of people, it never feels very crowded.

I'll keep it short and sweet...  Carne Asada and Crispy Fish tacos....yes!! Sub corn tortilla for the flour on the fish.  $2 tacos after 2pm on Tuesdays, and from 2pm to 6pm weekdays. There are actually SOOOOOOO many specials. $5 drink specials until 5pm like the other Upward Projects establishments, but some specials until 6pm. Service is hit or miss but it's better than Windsor, that's for sure.. Sit at the bar as long as there is more than one bartender. We've never had an issue until the one time there was only one guy doing everything. Pineapple mojitos....that is all.

This stadium has been a long time coming and I'm sooooo excited to have tickets for opening day (and after I'll update my review...hoping that it lives up to the 5-star rating I'm giving it).  We stopped by on Saturday afternoon to buy tickets for the February 27th game against the Dbacks. The facility was open for people to walk around and check it out, but a lot was roped off once inside. The stadium is beautiful!! It seats 15,000. The lawn section is huge (where we always sit for Spring Training) games, and it looks like concessions will be easily accessible out there.  I'm curious to see how the parking situation is going to work. I imagine a lot of traffic...  Only downside (but not worthy of deducting a star)...no beer shelves above the toilets. :(

After one too many negative experiences at the previous pediatric dentist, I decided to look for something closer to home. I found West Olive Pediatric Dentistry on Yelp (of course) and decided to give them a try. I called at 9:30am on a Friday and they had an available appointment a half hour later.   The office is nice and clean. There were some other patients that were being seen but we didn't wait long until we were called back. The main room is open with 5 chairs or so for the patients and each have a chair for the parent. The one thing I liked while researching on their website is that they encourage the parents to go back with the kids.   The staff is friendly and Dr. Umar Imtiaz is so good with the children. I'm happy we have found a new dentist for the girls and hope they continue to exceed my expectations every time..

I've only been to this location once, but from the first sip I knew I had hit the DD jackpot. I've been disappointed on numerous occasions at all of the other locations I have been to throughout the valley, but this was EXACTLY like I remember my East Coast coffee tasting like. Hope they keep it up.

I don't even know what I was looking for when I came across this business on yelp, but I bookmarked it right away. After about a week it was still all I could think about so as soon as opportunity presented itself, I drove up to Bell to check it out.  I ordered the roast pork banh mi and my lunch date ordered the shaken beef. We shared an order of potstickers. For drinks I had a Thai milk tea (no boba for me this time) and my girlfriend had a green tea.   Our sandwiches were amazing. Full of meat and veggies. The only downfall was the toasted baguette ripped the top of our mouths apart (don't you HATE when that happens?!), but I probably would have still chased my first sandwich with another if I was hungry enough and suffered the consequences. My Thai tea was awesome, her green tea was horribly bitter, most likely the result of tea bags being left in too long. Not going to drop a star off for iced tea though.  The winner of the whole lunch was the potstickers. Hands down, best I've ever had. We ordered the pork (there is also a chicken option) and they were amazing!! Handmade, steamed and fried, little pillows of meaty goodness.   The restaurant is clean, staff is friendly, and the menu has so many options, there is so,etching for everyone. I can't wait to go back to try the shaved ice..

Best Farmers Market in Phoenix. Tons of booths, excellent variety, great food. This market has grown so much in the last year and they just keep adding. Tons of parking and dog friendly.

You'd think that when an old, strip mall version of Starbucks moves into its own stand alone building with a drive-thru, everything would be 10 times better.  Unfortunately, this location is the exception to the rule.  Slow service - both inside and out. Lackluster 'partners' with personalities to match...this store took a nosedive after moving and apparently left any sort of character and charisma it did have, back in it's dark, empty, Starbucks shell.

Best place to get beers in Chase Field, unless you don't mind Bud Light and bombers of Blue Moon. Let the bartender know you are taking it to go if you plan to go to your seats or anywhere else in the park. The view from the bar itself isn't horrible, if you rather just stay.

I just noticed that the owner posted a response to my original review. Had I seen that sooner, I would have updated my review then.  I have continued to go to Northern Perks because it's on the correct side of the road as I drive my girls to school.  I have tried a variety of donuts and they have all been much better than the one I originally had. I even brought two dozen donuts to my team at work the day before Thanksgiving and they all loved them.  Excellent prices, friendly service.  I hope Northern Perks is successful because I will continue to go here when the donut craving kicks in.

Great shop. Love the location. I'm sooooooo happy that a Paper Source opened up on my side of town.  The Friends and Family event was fun. The store was crowded so that was nice to see. The layout of the store is easy to maneuver and they have a great selection of paper and crafting supplies as well as gifts (see my other Paper Source review). The store was packed with employees as well as managers from regional and probably the store in the Scottsdale Quarter. I witnessed some training going on but the new employees were jumping right in and were excited.  If you sign up with your email you will receive an email for 10% off. Not sure how long that promotion will last but even when it's over, sign up anyway. The emails are great as well as their catalog.  Happy crafting.

I didn't know there was an old La Piñata so when I saw this place pop up in the previous Mary Coyle spot, we put it on our 'must try' list. We have driven by on many evenings to see the patio full and alive.  We were in need of an early dinner on a Friday night so we stopped by to give it a try.    Parking was relatively easy since it was early, but be warned, the lot fills up. The restaurant was incredibly clean and I love the decor.  There is a descent size curved bar off to the left when you walk in that looks like it fills up easily. Good sized patios and sun shades for the interior dining room.  If you visit around sunset, be prepared for that sun to sneak in even if the shades are drawn.  Our server was super bubbly and attentive. When my girlfriend and I try new places, she will usually ask what the best or most popular item on the menu is. Our server hadn't been working there long so she was happy to grab one of the others who has been working for the restaurant for 7 years. He answered all of our questions and made some recommendations.   I had the pollo con queso and my dinner date ordered the yucutan with the machaca. Apparently hers was better than mine,  I didn't try it but I was happy with mine.  Both came deep fried, mine covered in a jalapeño cream cheese and she had the same on the side.  Rice and beans were both excellent.  I ordered a glass of wine that I didn't care for and our server took it back and replaced it with the sangria.  I honestly didn't care for that much either...I must not have been in a drinking mood since I never send anything back, let alone alcohol.  She did a great job of expressing that they just want their guests to be happy with everything.  We will definitely be returning. There are some other good looking items on the menu (some sort of Mexican tortilla stack thing...looks amazing. The woman next to us ordered it.) and hopefully I'll leave room for the fried ice cream.

I ordered the Mexican tortilla stack thing on my next visit. It was awesome. Highly recommend. Didn't leave room for friend ice cream though. Still regretting it because it looks so good.   Read my original review for more info.

Chestnut has potential to be amazing, unfortunately my experience was mediocre at best.   I have been wanting to go to Chestnut for the past year but rarely make it past 32nd st on Camelback. Why? I'm not too sure. Either way, I made a mental note to make this my destination for today.   The decor is beautiful. I love the yellow and grey. Not only are the colors bright but there is a ton of natural light. The center of the restaurant is the coffee bar/baked goods/regular bar/juice bar, and there is seating on the far side.  My lady and I each ordered a sandwich, grilled cheese for me, some sort of club for her and we each ordered the lemonade. I asked for bacon on the grilled cheese but it came without so I double checked to make sure I hadn't been charged. The guy who took our order didn't hear me order it I guess, therefore he didn't charge me for it. The grilled cheese does come with tomato on it. It was small, but delicious. The club was descent but nothing to get excited over. Best part of the sandwich was the Noble bread. As for the lemonade, way too tart.  After we ate we ordered a couple baked goods, a snickerdoodle for me and a pecan bar for her. They were also just ok. While she was up at the counter ordering, I was watching what was going on in the bar area and what I could see in the kitchen. I watched the guy who was making juice, grab a glove out of a mason jar. Thought it was kind of odd but figured they did that for decor purposes. Later I saw one of the employees filling it with gloves, but not wearing any while doing it. Kind of kills the purpose, don't you think?  I doubt I will return. I came, I saw, I conquered, and I left disappointed. It's a great spot but nothing to get excited over.
