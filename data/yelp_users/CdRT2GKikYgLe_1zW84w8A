Very tasty authentic food.  Very well cooked and tasty, the garlic chicken is delicious.  Some of the staff are less friendly than others and they have occasionally given me the wrong take out order by mistake... but overall a great place to eat.  If you're looking for authentic Chinese food this is where it's at!

This place is a complete disaster. The lady who cut my hair clearly did not want to be working there. She did a terrible job on my hair. She was incredibly rude also, very arrogant.  What a complete waste of money. If you want good customer service & a decent haircut, do not come here!!!!!!

The food I ordered (Chicken Fajita) was nothing short of disgusting. What was really disturbing is the waitress actually originally gave me the wrong order & aggressively argued with me to accept the wrong food. Everyone else's food looked like it has just come from the nether region of a dumpster - if you're looking to eat, avoid this place at all costs.

Been here once in 2010 but it was great.  It's a throwback to the 80s, no credit cards accepted, cash only.  Not sure how much business they lose doing this but it's a local eatery, it's that place you only know about if you live here.  Burgers were delish, freshly cooked, great flavor.  If you're after great tasting meat, and you're not vegetarian, come here.

This place changed my life.  I lost 60 pounds by going here.  The staff are friendly and there is a wide variety of equipment to use.  The managers are friendly.  I love the fact that it's 24 hours because that means it's never really super packed because everybody comes during different times and there's no mad rush at 5-6pm like most gyms.    Locker rooms are a bit small, but other than that, this is the place to be if you want to shed those pounds!

I had a muscle injury & the doctor gave me a 3 pronged plan with medication & stretches in order to speed recovery. It's so nice being able to see a doctor the same day rather than wait 2 weeks to get an appointment. OK - you have to wait in line when you get there but their hours are flexible so you will almost always get seen.

Think of the name of the restaurant as an oxymoron and you're on the right track.  Disgusting food, cheap ingredients, unfriendly staff, and pathetic dining area.  I lived on this food when I was broke 2 years ago and I regret it, I'd have rather gone into debt.
