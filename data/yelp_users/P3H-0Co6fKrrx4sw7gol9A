This is one of my favorite local restaurants and I always enjoy the food and service.  Their menu is terrific and has a number of great options although I find myself often ordering the Griddled Corn cakes (with bacon) for brunch or the 16th St beef short rib.      While I have never used them it appears they have some private space for larger group gatherings and the bar area is great and has a few TV's.    The service is always adequate to great and it is nice to have a restaurant that tends to have a relaxed atmosphere and is generally on the quieter side.  This is generally one of the restaurants I will take friends and family to when they are visiting as it tends to please a broad range of personalities and palettes.

I finally got to check out Niccoli's deli and it lived up to the hype. The owners Peppy and Joe were very friendly and told me a little about the place upon my arrival. It has a good selection of Italian meats, cheeses, oils, sauces, pastas, etc.  You can order a number of subs, pasta dishes and entrees and there is another room (very casual) where you can sit down and eat.   I ordered the meatball sub and it was awesome plenty of sauce, the meatballs were tender and the bread was soft and delicious. I'll be back to try the pizza and the Italian sub for sure.   If you are craving an east coast style deli then this place is for you.

Just got the "diamond" treatment and the car was ready in just a few minutes. The staff were all cordial and car looks great. No complaints.

Just ate there this past week and this was my 3rd visit to B&B.  Every time I've been here it's been nothing short of excellent.  I booked a reservation for six online just one day in advance for a Monday night.   The hostess greeted us and sat us immediately.  The waiter came by quickly greeted us and then sent over the sommelier.  The staff was very knowledgeable about each of the dishes and our waiters recommendations were perfect.  We did quite a bit of sampling but some of the highlights for the antipasti would be the grilled octopus, the caramelized fig salad and the caprese salad.  As for the primi and secondi I recommend the beef cheek ravioli, gnocchi with lamb ragu and mint and the short rib.  The bottom line...as someone who frequently travels North America and dines out regularly, this restaurant is easily in my top 5 and has made its way into my list of restaurants I must go to on all future Las Vegas trips.  I highly recommend it.

Let me start by saying I attempted to use this company and my review is not based on their products or install abilities.  I contacted First Impressions after speaking with them at the home and garden show about a small project for two decorative window coverings which they said was not too small of a job and would be able to take on.  They instructed me to contact them after the show with dimensions and other details and would be happy to work on this.  I supplied photos and dimensions and in a reasonable amount of time I was given a quote of $500.  The salesman Shane then followed up and said the owner feels $600 was more reasonable.  I politely declined based on the new price and said I would shop around and circle back should I change my mind.  Approximately 6 weeks later I contacted Shane again and said I would like to move forward,  I resent photos and dimensions per his request and he said he would get back to me the next day after speaking with the owner.  After 20 days and a few follow-up emails from me (all of which were polite and simply asked if there was any update) I was finally (politely) informed that First Impressions could not take this project at this time.  I inquired if it was because the job was too small and received a reply with a very brief apology for the inconvenience.  While all correspondence was polite I simply cannot recommend a company that changes the price on you, then takes 20 days to respond and turns down your business.  Too bad too their products look very nice on the website.  Just a brief update 6/13/14: Since the time of this review I contacted Great Gates who designed and built the product I needed and at a price lower than the original quote provided by First Impression.  I have now used Great Gates for a few different projects and have been satisfied with their service.

Update 1/26/16: Apparently the business is under new ownership and so far they are not off to a great start.  I brought in my truck (I hand wash/2 bucket method my other vehicles) and was immediately thrown off (not knowing ownership had changed) when new costs were added to the price.  $10 for mud removal (okay the truck was muddy) but then another $3 for excessive dirt...umm you're a car wash?  The truck was muddy as I took it off-road, but it's not the first time and the previous owners always took care of it without any up-charges.  If the car came out just as clean as it used to I probably wouldn't be writing any update to this (previously 4 star review), but instead I found the roof to be dirty and the driver side had numerous swirl marks and a few minor scratches (and no this didn't happen off-roading - there was no mud in this area and I inspect the truck daily...I noticed this as soon as I got home and parked it after the wash).  There are many water marks, the tire spray and interior dressing all appear to have worn off in less than 24 hours and there is over-spray on the fenders.  It does not appear that quality cleaning products are used and either they are not using the correct non-abrasive cleaning cloths or used at least one after it fell on the ground.  Sadly I will now have to go back to N. Scottsdale 20 minutes away to get a quality hand-wash.  Prior Owner 4 star Review: Ever since Big J closed up his physical location and went mobile I have been struggling to find a proper car wash facility.  As someone who only hand washes my vehicles it is difficult to find a good hand car wash at a reasonable price.  There are some really great detail shops in N. Scottsdale, but most operate by appointment only (which is why I generally don't use mobile services) and can be a little pricier.  Stewart Detailing is the first true hand wash and dry I have found that is in my area, reasonably priced and seems to perform a very good wash.  The only thing I have noticed is the bug cleaning on the front is not a thorough as it should be and I tend to finish the job when I get home.  I have used them four times now with my vehicle and each wash was as good as the last.  They also have a dog wash on premise which I have not utilized yet, but is a pretty good idea and allows customers to do something productive while they wait.  They have a shaded sitting area and two indoor sitting areas, one where customers can view their vehicle being washed which is conducted indoors and another where customers have a view of their vehicle being dried and detailed.  I like being able to keep an eye on my car.  The staff has been very friendly and took no issue with my occasional request to clean a specific area more thoroughly such as my carpeted truck bed.   Overall I am very happy with the quality of their work and will continue to use them.
