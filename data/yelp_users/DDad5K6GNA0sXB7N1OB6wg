NOTE: Only reviewed the soda fountain, not the food (but I wouldn't come here for the food anyways!)  I'm sad to say I found this place too late during my time in AZ. I LOVE this place! The soda combinations are amazing. I've tried the phosphates, egg-creams, malts, etc. My favorite soda/ice cream combos were the casablanca and the scarlett o'hara, but its mostly because they reminded me of sherbet ... yum :)  I've heard the food is horrible so I wouldn't touch it considering the many other great eateries in the area. The only flaw I have found with this place is the hours of operation...they close really early which is horrible when the late night sweet tooth hit.  Great place to go on a hot day or on the weekends...especially if you like soda.

This place was pretty interesting. I never thought of japanese and italian being a fusion combo, but here it is.   The italian food was different, but not worth it. My fiance ordered the TanTan-Men and Gyoza and wow, you definitely get what you paid for. So much food and large pot of ramen. The prices are reasonable, approx $10 per person, maybe a little more if you order drinks and/or dessert.

This place is very delightful, its just a pity that the location is so obscure that they will have to move soon if they plan to keep their business alive. As many have said, it is tucked in the middle of many large buildings and since the AMC is under construction, the business has dropped considerably.   Anyways, the review the food, we ordered the highly yelp reviewer recommended chocolate croissant, the ham and cheese quiche and a last minute decision of the almond croissant.  Chocolate croissant: The pastry is flaky and has the right amount of chocolate. The chocolate filling itself is not too sweet and would definitely be a fav for dark chocolate lovers.   Ham and cheese quiche: it was good, no complaints at all!  Almond croissant: This was a surprise and we actually preferred it over the chocolate croissant. It was buttery, gooey and flaky with a hint of almond and powdered sugar. Again, not too sweet and finger lickin' good.   Like many have said previously, it is a bit pricey but considering my mouth was happy, I didn't mind. If and when they decide to move, I will be sure to check their website and follow them to their new location.  Side note: if you are planning to come here, be sure to call because they have had to decrease their hours of operation. Also, they had a sign that said they will not be serving dinner in August.

If you want street tacos that will remind you of the ones you get south of the border, this is the place to be! Their horchata tastes like home-made as well. My fiance loves the bombero burrito, but beware because it is big and spicy. Every time he orders it, I need to have a bit because it is so tasty but he needs to stop me because I have horrible heart burn problems.

I've been craving a good bowl of ramen ever since I moved here from L.A./S.D. So obviously I resort to Yelp for all my answers in food goodness.  I tried the miso ramen, sashimi, and vegi tempura. It was a pretty damn good bowl of ramen. It was a little expensive, but when I saw the HUGE bowl, I understood. Sashimi was well cut and fresh.   Overall, this place is good, but expensive...which makes sense considering there aren't that many authentic japanese ramen places around. It helps to have a place around when the craving strikes!

I went back 2 months ago and was not happy. The ramen was so bland and the cost did not help me keep the food down :(

For the price, the sushi and sashimi are decent. The best time to go is during happy hour where sushi/sashimi are half price, so 5 orders can fill your tummy and not leave your wallet empty.

A darn good Pizza!  We've been here twice so far, through the recommendation of a friend. The location is not the greatest and you would never expect how great the quality of the pizza is.   The first time I went there, I got two 7 inch pizza's, I'd say this is a personal pan pizza size. I got the Spinach Pie and the Santa Fe Chicken with Original Deep Dish Crust (they have a Thin Crust option as well). The Santa Fe Chicken was good, eventhough the chicken was a little dry. The Spinach Pie was AMAZING!!!! This is what a vegetarian pizza is suppose to taste like...pure awesomeness!  The second time, I got a 12 inch (enough for 2 people and/or left overs): half Pesto Bianco w/ chicken and half BBQ Chicken with Wheat Deep Dish Crust. The chicken yet again was dry, so I was noticing a team with the chicken. Luckily I don't judge a pizza place by it's chicken, so that bodes wel for Nello's. I can understand how chicken can dry out during the cooking process. As for the pizza itself, the BBQ was decent (it reminded me of a generic CPK BBQ chicken pizza) and the Pesto was pretty good. All in all, it was the wheat crust that sold us this time.  Thus far, I would recommend the Spinach Pie with Wheat Deep Dish Crust!

I proclaim that this is the best sushi/sashimi I have had thus far in Phx. I love sushi but its been so hard to find a place that has good enough fish where it reminds me of eating clouds (yes, good fish should taste more like clouds than fish!)  Anyways, the 5 stars is not because it is the best fish I have ever had, but it is the closest thing I have gotten in the state. The price is higher than other sushi bars in the area, but once you try it, you'll understand why. The quality of fish it top notch and the sushi chefs will even tell you which fish is in season. I first ordered a sake bomber (large beer and small sake) for $6.50. We ordered the Agedashi tofu and mixed veggie tempura. The tofu had a great soft, almost custard like, texture and tasted perfect. The tempura was good, nothing exciting to note. For entree, we got the Chirashi bowl, a spicy yellowtail roll, crazy roll, yellowtail sashimi and albacore sashimi. The chirashi was a very pleasant surprise with the amount of fresh cut fish but what solidified our decision for best sushi in AZ thus far, was the sashimi. The albacor was PERFECT and made me reminisce about the best sushi I had in Seattle, which did taste like clouds in my mouth. The dessert special of the day was crepes and they made my mouth very happy and was a perfect end to the meal.  Overall, with the Yelp Check-in and 10% off our bill, we got out of there for $81 including tax and tip. As a said before, not cheap but not a bad price considering all that was ordered.   Note: if you plan to come here on a Friday, its best to make a reservation because it can get crowded. Also happy hour is until 7pm.

Pretty decent and fresh sushi, for AZ. Prices are great, especially during happy hour. It's a little more expensive than other sushi places in the area, but still affordable. Expect to pay approx $20 per person for a full meal (appetizer plus entree or a couple of rolls/nigiri)

Now this is what I call a good hot dog!...Not just good, they are GREAT :) This what a ballpark hot dog is suppose to taste like...and cost. The  value is amazing for everything you get.   Oh, and I tried the onion rings after reading all the great reviews and they truly are some of the best onion rings I've ever had.   By the way, I am usual not the type to get up to order seconds, but this time, I couldn't help myself...just had to have another!

Come here if you really want to experience a truely authentic pho restaurant. Nothing fancy: Dirty vinyl tables, padded and metal framed chairs from the 80s, and the dingy smell...perfect! Once I walked in, I knew I would be leaving happy.  I love Pho Ga, but every other pho place around hear is to lazy to make the chicken broth, its always with beef broth and it just never tastes right. This place on the other hand had the best Pho Ga I've have ever since moving here. The seasoning was perfect and the chicken was cooked well. We came right after lunch hour, so the service was a few minutes slower than expected. Also, they probably went through then etire pot of regular pho broth, so my fiances pho was not as good (it had a lil oil at the top).  I was very impressed with the portion size and price. Its a few dollars cheaper than any other pho place around hear and they offer the XL bowl for $1.50 extra, a great value.

This is the only place I come to when I have a donut craving. Much better quality , taste and price than Krispy Kremes and Dunkin Donuts. They are always open, fully stocked and I have yet to have a bad experience of a stale donut. The ladies behind the counter are always nice, patient, and willing to answer questions. It also doesn't hurt that they have a fridge with a wide selection of breakfast/dairy beverages. I love these donuts because they taste great and the texture is even better. Its a great balance between the fluffy interior and subtle crunchy exterior.

I have never really had a full German meal, but wow, this was tasty. We ordered the sausage special and a schnitzel plate and were stuffed. Each dish is served with 2 sides, one potato based and another cabbage based. The waitress is very german and such a sweet lady, very helpful with offering advice about what is on the menu. The beer selection is amazing. Before our meal was served, we received a few slices of rye bread with butter, and loved it! With all that we ordered, we got out of there in under $25. This place is a great value, especially if you want to leave stuffed.

I hated this place. It looks like a nice first date restaurant but the food and price are so not worth it. The hot tofu soup was pitiful and my fiance ordered the bbq and a sushi which were both too expensive for their own good and the sushi tasted like something was old....Never again! Chodang, here I come!

Amazing food and drinks, but sadly a little too pricey for me...luckily someone else paid!  I liked Roaring Fork because it has a wide range, yet short list, of food, good portions, cooked well, and I definitely got my moneys worth with the Huckleberry Margarita. The seared Ahi, green chili pork stew, and short ribs were delicious. I took off one star because the place was too dim, and we were with a few children, and this place is not kid friendly. And as usual, it just cost too much!

This was a random surprise. It looks like a market but then we realized that the restaurant menu and ordering area is in the back , with the tables interspersed among the grocery isles. The market itself has a great selection of pasta, sauces, biscuits, and wine. The food itself is great.  The menu was huge and I kinda got lost in it so I ended up ordering a half turkey and provolone sandwich on nine grain, a cup of minestrone soup (which came with bread) and a side meat ball. The sandwich was good, it wasn't the best but good for the price. The minestrone was yummy. And the meatball was AMAZING!!! My fiance had the cheese steak sandwich, which was very tasty, but the clam chowder was pretty bland.   The wait was a bit long, but we really were not in a hurry so it was not a big deal. Also, the salads looks great. The next time I come here, I'm definitely getting another meatball, maybe try one of the other hot sandwiches and one of the salads.

New american veggie restaurant. ...pretty darn good! The fake meat is cooked well and has a good texture. We ordered the bowls, one with noddles and the other with brown rice and both were full of flavor and did not taste like what you would normally expect out of a vegetarian restaurant...it didn't tasty "healthy", it tasted good. We also got the spicy edamame.  Love the taste and the flavor, only flaw is the price point. I would come here again, but if the price was $2 dollars less on each item, I would come here at least once a week.

I am so glad I found this place because I no longer have to make baklava when ever I get the craving. Yes I know there are places to get baklava around Phx but they were either too soggy, too sweet, too sugary, too stale, etc. Something was always wrong. But this place is definitely a diamond in the rough. They have a basic selection of middle eastern food like the sherwarma and the kabobs, which are all very tasty and well prepared and much cheaper than the Persian Room (I'm not the biggest fan of the Persian Room bc its just not worth the drive and money unless you are on a date and trying to impress someone). They also have a great selection of baklava like almond, pistachio, cashew, walnut, and the princess which is think is a combination of all the nuts. Regardless of what you get, you will be happy (both mouth and wallet).   The downside is that since it is in a grocery store, its a bit crowded and sometimes the wait can be a bit long, but I don't really mind the wait bc I know everything is fresh and prepared when ordered.

I am actually very content with their Japanese desserts. My personal favorite and must have when I'm in the area is the green-tea mouse cake. I've had better in LA but considering I am currently located here and its actually good, it definitely hits the spot when the craving arises for Asian desserts. The people are friendly and willing to explain what is in everything and are very attentive.

Ok the first time I came here, I was very disappointed in the selection of items, especially after reading previous review. BUT, then I realized that I went at a bad time, it was the end of the day and they sold out of everything! I recently went back at the store opening time and a lot happier with the market. They sell freshly made bentos, made in house, and they are perfect for microwaving at home or in the market for a cheap and satisfying meal. The key is to get there early, bc they are limited and run out quick, but they have a good variety of bentos.  One draw back is that it is smaller than expected, so if you come from a place like SoCal, where Japanese markets were like large grocery stores with mini stores and restaurants located inside, you might not be too happy.

So I've heard everyone rave about this place but every time we've come here, there is always at least an hour wait. So we decided to come early today to avoid a wait...only to be told that they do not do outdoor seating or takeout on the weekends (our dog was with us and we were not going to leave him in the car). We tried to be flexible but it was like they didn't care for our business...looks like it was never meant to be. They didn't even try to offer an explanation for their policy. Don't think I'll try to eat here again...not worth paying $16 for a pizza when the service is not worth it!

Well this was a pleasant surprise.  This place is small, a little cramped, but the food definitely makes up for it.    When seated, the waitress was very attentive and coffee was served almost immediately. The menu is small, but full of all the basics, along with the special of the day.   My fiance ordered the special, while I ordered the salami scramble. They are served with toast (white, wheat, sourdough, or cinnamon raisin) and potatoes (hash browns or country fried potatoes). We ordered the wheat, which was served with a chunk of butter melting between the slices and a small cup of jelly. The toast was served almost immediately after taking our order and it was full of nom noms. The service is fast and you never have to wait for a waitress to come by. There is always someone nearby to help.   The prices were very good as well. The average cost of entrees is between $4-8 dollars and the coffee has free refills. The amount of food served is just enough to fill you up with out making you feel like a glutton. They don't take reservations and the place is very small with limited seating so either arrive early in the morning or expect to wait a while.

First of all, I did not expect to come into a cafeteria style eatery. They serve the basics of BBQ, nothing too fancy. A few appetizers and side options, like cheesy potatoes, baked mac n' cheese, fresh corn bread, etc. All were very tasty.   For entree, they have a wide variety of meats and combos and samplers. Overall, this is a great place,... meat was well prepared, a little pricey for what I was expecting.

I actually enjoyed this place and it was a pleasant surprise to find a good yet casual Italian restaurant that didn't remind me or the Olive Garden. The calamari was great and it was a huge serving so by the time we were done with the calamari, bread and salad, I was pretty much ready to go home. But before we realized that, we had already ordered dinner. Luckily we requested half portion with the other half placed in to-go containers so we were not complete gluttons. The service was great and the seating outside was pleasant, less kitschy than the inside. Only problem with sitting outside are the bugs because of the greenery growing around the restaurant. The cost for the meal was reasonable, about $50 for 2 entrees, an appetizer, 2 drinks, and dessert.

Note: this review is only for the macaroons  So I love macaroons and when I heard that this place had a great selection, I had to go. The main problem is the hours of operation which are very limited in my opinion. And as for the dessert of concern, I tried the mini versions and they were very creamy and delicious without being too sweet. I suggest trying a variety of the minis before purchasing the larger ones. There were many that I choose that were a wonderful surprise compared to the others. Like the strawberry cream one, which I am not a big fan of fruit flavored desserts, but this was surprisingly good.

So I finally came back to try the Japanese dishes for dinner. I got the Chiken Katsu Donburi for $8.50. It was a huge bowl and definitely got my moneys worth because I could barely finish even half of it. My fiance got the Spicy Miso Ramen with Mini Gyudon combo for $11. The soup base was good, but the meat was not as good and I wish there was more noddles. And yet again, a large portion of food for a good price. We also got the Melon Cream Soda, so we made it out of the restaurant for $25 total.  Overall, the best ramen I've had in the city, minus the meat, and all for a good price. I didn't try the sushi again for fear of not being happy again. If you come hear, stick to the Japanese food, not the sushi (regardless of the vast selection).

First of all, if you are going to have dim sum, go early during the weekend because that is when the quality and freshness are best. Also go in a large group so that the bill is less for everyone. I have been here a few times on Sunday mornings around 10 am and never have to worry about waiting for a table. They have a decent selection of dim sum dished. My usual's are the "footballs", the Hau gau, and the taro cakes, all of which are decent. If you wait long enough, you might be able to get your hands on the coconut pastries called "snow balls" which are very enjoyable. In a hungry group of 4, you can expect to pay $20-25 total as a group and not want to eat anything for the next 6-12 hours.

Finally, a decent boba place in the area. All the other places around the area may have selection, like the place in the LeeLee's complex, but the boba SUCKS!  This place actually had good boba, not too chewy, not too hard, not too sweet...pure awesomeness! I was verging on a 4 to a 4.5 rating but the quality of boba rounded to score up to 5.  The drinks itself are good and classic, nothing too crazy or fancy. Also, the Diamond Ice is a must have for the summer. A mini size cost $4.50, but once you see what a mini looks like, the price makes sense. I was enough for 2 ppl, at least!   Also, the cost of the drinks here are more than I'm use to, but since I saw fresh fruit, not not just bottles of syrup, behind the counter, I have no problem forking out the extra amount.  Over all great place, I just wish it was open later (I've never been to a Boba tea house that closed as early as 8pm)

I've come here many times and always enjoyed my bowl of hot tofu soup. I came here initially because I was craving something similar to Tofu House in San Diego. I also went to Takamatsu and Hodori  because these 3 were in a way in competition for best Korean food-faire. This was the first I tried and the one I have continued to come back to.   They have a decent selection of hot tofu soups  which is served with stone pot rice, which I love, especially at the end when the rice gets crunchy as the end. Their selection of kimchi sides is extensive and tasty. I don't think half of them are really authentic but they taste good so I won't hold that against them. Also, the price is good as well.

I was disappointed, the food is just too bland!  My husband and I ordered a variety of food to get an idea of there food spectrum: Garlic Chicken Kabob, Lamb Vindaloo, Palak Paneer, Garlic Naan, Gulab Jamun, and Rass Malai.  The only positives I saw was that the meat was cooked well...that's it! The sauces for each dish lacked flavor and spice. My husband even requested Indian spicy and it wasn't even spicy...it tasted like a mild. The Garlic Naan was decent.  At this point we were going to give it a 3...barely! Then the desserts came...  The gulab jamun was firm and frozen and it seemed like they added extra butter/ghee to the syrup. The Rass Malai was too thick and creamy, it seemly like it was soaked in heavy cream, which messed up the texture of the paneer. And after we saw the bill, their score plummeted to 2.   It was not worth it. So many of my classmates have gushed about how great the food is, but I realized, they probably dont know any better. I grew up near Little India around LA where good Indian food was no hard to find, so I could just be spoiled.

NOTE: This review is only about the smoothies/juices  Sadly I really wanted to like this place, because I've been looking for a decent local juice bar...and I apparently still have yet to find a good one! I decided to order 2 juices. but couldn't find one that screamed ginger (I love ginger), so I asked the girl behind the counter what she would recommend and she mentioned that they can add ginger to any of the drinks. I decided to get the Pucker Up! and Berry Me Alive, both with ginger. I was hoping to get a small to try, but the size didn't seem worth it for $4.50 plus extra for ginger, so I got both in a medium size.   The Pucker Up did make my lips pucker but not in a good way. It was bland and sour and I could feel my stomach acids churning. The Berry Me Alive tasted like a cup of frozen berries. Yes, I know frozen fruits are practical in such places, but I've never had berries that tasted so lack-luster. Also, I don't know how much ginger I get for 50 cents, but it wasn't enough because I couldn't even taste it.  For 2 medium drinks plus ginger, the total can to about $13. So not worth it! Don't plan to ever waste my money here. I'll just drive to Thrive in Gilbert for now.

OMG, I feel like I'm on a role with finding half-decent Indian food. After being here for over 2 years, I'm either finding some good places or my taste-buds have lost their touch. Since I refuse to believe the later, I was VERY happy with this place. Great place for dosa...finally I don't have to make it myself :) Seriously legit dosa!  We ordered rasam, the Grill Thali and a rasmalai. The Grill Thali is about $10 and is a good start if you want a general idea of what to order in the future. It came with masala dosa, idlli, vadai, sambhar, and a sweet (gulab jamun)... great value for what you get. The masala dosa was on par, vadai was made well, idlli was a bit dense and dry, sambhar was flavored well, and gulab jamun was not frozen (I've found way too many places that store it in the freezer and it kills me every time!). The spice level of the rasam was good but felt like it was missing something, possibly tamarind. The rasmalai was made well, but a little bit sweeter than I'm use to. All this for approx $16 for 2...My tummy was happy!  Woodlands is not the best place ever, but the dosa was good enough to make me want to come back to try the other types of dosa. Everything else was satisfactory and edible. I've noticed a lot of ppl critiquing the decor, but heck, it looks like a lot of the great places in Artesia (the little India area located in L.A.) so please don't come here if you're going to be critical of the cafeteria style.

I am usually happy with their pho, unlit I go back to OC see what its really suppose to taste like. Everything I've tried here has been good with good portion sizes. My only qualm, which is the same for many other pho places in the area, it the lack of chicken pho broth for the pho ga, its always beef based. Also, I've noticed that every time i come here for chicken pho in the morning, the broth is not fully cooked and is a bit oily, which is why I've made the switch to vermicelli bowls during these times.

This place is expensive, but the food is made to order and of high quality. We went here for the Sunday supper, which is a 3 course meal for $35 per person and I was stuffed. The bread is amazing and the olive oil was very tasty.   For the first course, we had a choice of shrimp louis or salad. I went for the salad, because I'm not must of a shrimp fan. I was a little worried about the salad because it had blue cheese, which is a hit or miss for my taste buds, but that was a very tasty salad. They offer supplement dishes for an extra $10, which my finance got and it was worth it! The second course offered a choice of cioppino, southwest burrito, or gnocchi. The clams in the cioppino were perfect and the burritos were tasty...but i do wish they provided more salsa. The last course was dessert, which was a house-made It's-it and its probably the best ice cream sandwich i've had in a restaurant. Overall, I was very happy with the service and Elliot, the owner, is very hospitable and friendly.   The atmosphere is a bit dark for me but I understand it's to provide a romantic feel.

I've been looking for a crepe place ever since I got here and finally found this place, the only place! Great place to go for dessert crepes. They are a little pricey for my taste, but I thought the crepes were practically perfect.   The crepes were not too thin, not too soggy, and overflowing with nutella, strawberry and bananas. I have not tried the savory crepes yet. The only reason I take one star off is because of the hours of operation, they close by 4, which did not make me too happy.

Initially I came here expecting a lot of healthy organic relatively tasteless and expensive food, but I was very surprised and boy was I wrong. The drinks/elixirs may sound like medicine but they were very tasty, especially the ginger one (and I LOVE ginger!). We had the onion tart for the appetizer and it was a wonderful taste explosion in my mouth. For dinner we ordered the squash casserole and the bison burger. With the 2 drinks, we got out of there for about $60 which is a bit pricey but so worth it considering the taste, quality and service.

The lady that makes the tea is a true professional. She even has degrees in it! She was extremely knowledgeable and was willing to make or suggest anything to heal your ailment. It's a truly wonderful place to go, especially if you are not feeling very well. This is the first place I go if I start to feel like I'm about to get sick. And the prices are pretty good too!

The ice cream flavors are all delicious and the quality and texture are amazing. This place has a farm associated with it so everything is freshly prepared and made. They even sell small pints of various flavors in their fridge display. Also in their fridge display are nomy treats like apple cake and chocolate dipped macaroons. This place even sells its own flavor butter. I even had one of my friends order his girlfriends ice cream cake from here and they did a great job with the flavor combination and overall custom design. We love to drop by this place after an hour at the dog park just to treat ourselves for being a good doggy parents :P

This place was definitely a surprise. I'm from LA and had to move here. Lets just say moving to a state without an ocean in site makes you a little skeptical about the sushi.   They're happy hour specials are a great deal and the sushi was pretty fresh and tasty. Also, they have a great selection in sashimi.   They have good food, great service, all for a reasonable price.  Btw, the avocado salad is tasty, but extremely large portion. Good to split with someone else.

So I've tried a lot of thai restaurants in phoenix, ever since I moved here a couple of years ago and this is by far one of the best I have tried in the area. Regardless of service, I come for the food which has never let me down. The cost is reasonable, the food is always on par and I have yet to have any real issue with the service. You can't go wrong if you choose to try one of the curry or rice dishes.

I am a major fan of this small brewery. They do not serve food, but they do have free popcorn. Due to the lack of food, they normally have food trucks outside which is convenient because the foods pretty top notch.  This is a very casual place to grab a beer and my fav is the milk stout. Its really creamy and a little sweet. Overall, they have a great variety and all of the beers are very smooth. Definitely a place to visit again.

Note: this is a review based on food, I don't drink wine!  I've been here twice and thought the food was great both times! The bruschetta is a must and enjoyed the first four listed on the menu. I cant recall what they are but I'm always happy with them. The place is a bit noisy and pricey. To avoid the noise, I suggest sitting outside because it is well shades, and you can actually talk to and hear what your friends have to say. Also the inside is a bit crowded for me.   My finance and I kinda stick out like a sore thumb as this place because it predominately caters to older middle-aged Caucasians, and we are quite the opposite demographic, but I wont hold this detail against them.   The reason I remove a star is because the cost is a bit hefty. If you come here for wine during happy hour, its a great deal, but not so much for the food, hence my initial warning that this post will only be about the food.

Definitely the people to get your dog trained by. They offer in-home training at a reasonable price, and it includes a follow up visit as well for ~$100. We discussed all of the problems we were having and were given solutions for all of our doggie pit-falls and saw results immediately. That Tammy surely has a way with dogs. The moment she arrived, the dog knew she meant business. And as for socialization with other dogs, she even brings along her own Border Collies, who are very calm and well trained. Very Helpful! Tammy and her husband are very prompt with their phone and email responses, and offer wonderful positive reinforcement advice and techniques.

This is an amazing noodle house. The noodles are fresh and prepared in front of you (well, actually behind an open window into the kitchen, but its good to know the kitchen is clean.)   Only come here for the noddles, everything else is not that great. This is why I removed 1 star. We ordered the gyoza multiple time, both steamed and pan friend, and they were different every time. We usually order them because its $4 for 8 pieces, and its not the regular size you are use to, they are "Super-sized." Don't waste your time with the boba, they are not prepared well.  We come here every week, because we get full off of a large bowl of noodles, for cheap! The average entree is at most $7-8 which I think is a great value for fresh noddles.

Thank you Phx for not completely sucking in the Indian food sector. This place was a surprise. I won't compare it to anything in LA, because its hard to beat their cost and taste. But the food was affordable and the flavors were enjoyable.   When I ate the murg makhani or the beghan bhatra, I wasn't angry! Everything tasted fresh, the dinner buffet looked good, and the owners are very hospitable. Sooooo much better than Guru Palace...I don't understand how anyone can eat there.   I didn't have the dinner buffet, but since it looked fresh and included lassi and chai, $9 seems like a great value and will definitely indulge in it next time. At the end, they gave us some gulab jamun and it was warn and cooked well...not frozen, thank gawd!   My only complaint is that the spice level was a little low for us, but considering the lack of decent indian food in the area, it's really not a make or break thing. With everything we ordered, plus leftovers, we got out of there for less than $30.

I absolutely love their hot dog creations. They have very different and unique flavor combination and they are served on naan like flat bread, not the same old hot dog bun.  My personal favs are the Aiko and the Moki. All hot dogs cost $5 which i'm willing to pay for these tasty puppies!

WOW...this place was amazing. I came here for my birthday because I've never been to an Izakaya before...it has been described as Japanese tapas.  I will say, this place is expensive...but the food was worth it. ($100 for 2 ppl, with tip and without alcoholic beverages) I did not have a complaint about anything. The menu is small and changes depending on the season, so the food was fresh. The drink menu is much larger. Chef Nobuo Fukada is an artist and the way he combines textures and flavors is amazing. He makes each dish individually so expect to be there a while and the food is brought out in the order of simple/light to bold flavors, so its customized taste adventure.   The restaurant it self does not take reservations, but the Omakase (a private chef tasting at the chef's table where the chef creates non-menu items for you) is reservations-only and they are currently booked up 5-6 weeks in advance. This is only available Thursday - Saturday, during dinner, and the price ranges $100-150 per person. I am cheap when it comes to food, but I am seriously considering making a reservation because the dishes he creates are worth it.

Lets start off by saying that Nobuo is an artist. I booked a reservation for the omakase (sp?) a few months in advance, and was served 7 courses by the chef at the chef's table. It usually ranges from $100-150 per person, depending on the day or season, right now its about $135.  The food was delicious and I never knew I would ever eat caviar or foie gras, and actually enjoy it.

Like many others have said, this is pretty much the only hot pot restaurant I have found and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Like many ShabuShabu restaurants (btw, this is not really shabu shabu...i think its Chinese hot pot, but i'm not sure?) this place can get expensive depending on how many  meats and vegetable options are ordered, but it is good to keep in mind that the quality of the meats, tofu and veggies is very good. The freshness and variety of veggies is what sold me. Also, the place offers a great variety in soup broth selections.   So far, the only one I have tried and really enjoyed is the YinYang broth. This broth is actually a combination of two with a divider separating them so its almost like a two-for-one special. One broth is spicy and flavorful while the other is a bit more settle, allowing your taste buds to enjoy of flavor roller coaster. Another great thing about this place is that they keep adding liquid to the broth so you never run low on it.  Side note for the minus 1 star: avoid the juices and a lot of other drinks, they are too sweet or come straight out of a bottle. Stick to water and they serve you tea at the end.

This place was pretty awesome and I'm glad we found it. Not only is it in a wonderful location (for Phoenix) next to the canal in Scottsdale, but the food is really good too. My fiance and I ordered a lot of food without realizing how much food we actually order so I was great for left overs the next day.  We ordered the pear and gorgonzola flat bread, the crab dip, trout beignets, corn enchiladas, glazed salmon, and the side order of smoked gouda mac n' cheese...all for about $80. So between 2 people and multiple extra servings to take home, it was well worth it. The portions are great and not claim jumper large, the quality is great and the service was awesome as well. The to-go containers were separated and labeled so the hash that came with the salmon was in a separate container and the salad that came with the enchiladas were done in the same manner as well.  I will definitely come back to try more food, but this time we are going to try to not order as much so we have room to try and judge the desserts.

So we've been looking for gastropubs in the area and the first to pop up on yelp is this place. We decided to drop by the place after a not so wonderful experience at a concert and this place really made me feel a lot better. The food and ambiance are great! We got here pretty late so I was surprised they were willing to seat us.    We had the 'Tender Belly' Pork Belly Pastrami, 'Kilt Lifter' fondue, and we were intrigued by the "Pig in the Orchard" Bread Pudding so we ordered that as well. The prices are a bit high (every thing we ordered averaged $10), but everything tasted great so no complaints about the price from me. The service is a bit hit or miss hence the minus 1 star but I will definitely be coming here again.

First off, I have never had Cambodian food so I might be biased....but this has been one of the best meals I've had in Phx (for the price)!  Since my fiance and I have never tried any Cambodian food, we thought we'd try a good variety: Jasmine Tea (hot): Good tea, very floral and aromatic Spring Roll: It was HUGE and similar to Vietnamese spring rolls. Order 1 and you'll have enough to split with someone else. Pleah Beef Salad: Never thought I'd ever eat or like beef in a salad but it wad a wonderfully clean and refreshing taste. Loat Cha: I've never seen this type of noodle! It was serves with egg and beef and one of my favorite dishes of the evening. Noumpang Pate (Pork and Pate Sandwich): Good sandwich and nice bread for $3...similar to those Vietnamese sandwiches. Banana Tapioca Pudding: This was a banana with a texture similar to a plantain, that was submerged in a hot bowl of tapioca and coconut milk. Very simple and enjoyable, and a 3$ for 2 people, I can't complain. It's a great dessert to finish the meal off.  So, all-in-all, we got out of there with 3 entrees, an appetizer and dessert for under $30...WOW!  If you couldn't figure it out by now, Sekong has gained two new repeat customers :)  FYI: this place is difficult to find if you are driving west on Indian School Rd and you won't realize you passed it until you see the 99 cent store. So after 16th St and 13th Pl, keep an eye out for a sign that says parking in the rear and drive into the parking lot, otherwise you won't find this place until you make a u-turn...the sign is visible when you are driving east.

I came here about a month ago, just randomly on a weekend, because we were looking for a decent breakfast/brunch place. Luckily, this place was listed in my bookmarks. The food menu is not huge but it covers the ground in terms of variety. Their beverage list actually seemed longer.  Anyways, we ordered the deviled egg dip and chips and Russian roulette for appetizers. The dip was amazing and the mix of peppers in the russian roulette were great. I suggest taking a small bit to test the peppers if you're not sure. For entree, we ordered the Veggie Stack and  Porkwich. Again, another hit and the veggie stack was a pleasant surprised...it was relatively healthy and tasty. We had a few of the sides but the only one I remember is the mac n' cheese. If you come here, GET IT! It is some of the best mac n' cheese I've had in a long time.  For dessert, you can just head next door to Churn with is an old school ice-crean and candy shop.    The prices were on the reasonable/slightly expensive side. For the food and service, I will definitely be making a drive back to downtown PHX soon.

This place is great. The food is Northern Chinese similar to Chinese Muslim food. They have a great variety for reasonable prices. Also, everything is freshly prepared and you can even see them make the dumplings and pork pie behind a glass window. We got the stir fry spinach (bok choy) with garlic, sesame bread, pork and napa cabbage dumplings, pork pie and green onion pancakes. I know its a lot of food but we wanted to try a good variety and it cost about $27. Not to shabby! the spinach and garlic was really fresh and flavorful. The bread was decent, almost like a dense curried bread. The pork dumplings were similar to soup dumplings, one of my most favorite dumplings ever. The pork pie was almost like a pork patty covered in dumpling dough and pan-fried. It was crunchy, moist, juicy and delicious all at the same time. We were getting full so we ended up only eating half of the green onion pancakes which were well prepared. We will definitely be making another trip back here soon.  Side note: They sell bags of frozen/take-home dumplings. About $10 for a bag of 40.

Love the dessert but beware of the Oh My Afagato...especially if you are a caffeine light weight like myself. We went here after my birthday dinner and I made the mistake of ordering it without realizing that it came with vietnamese coffee ice cream, not vanilla. I could not understand why I was laughing so much and felt  and was motivated to just start running (i didn't!). After my realization, I traded with my fiance and ate the rest of his Everything but the kitchen sink. The combo of salty, crunchy and sweet was perfect.

I absolutely love this place and its next to JoBot which is another plus. Great selection of nachos, all for about $7 with great ingredients and a unique combo of flavors. Plus, its open really late, I think until 4am on the weekends, which makes this my new favorite place to hit up when those late night junk food cravings hit and I don't want Mexican food. The price is a little high, but you get a lot of nachos for what you pay for.

NOTE: I came here for the pho, not the happy hour beer or bar food.  This is quite possibly the worst pho I've had in a long time. It was bland and the hoisen and siracha did not help. I ordered a salty plum drink and it came 30-45 min later, after asking about it 3 times so obviously I was a little pissed at the service. Also, I've never had a red berry flavored salty plum drink. The server was not knowledgeable about the menu at all and even forgot the side of rice my friend ordered, but was still charged for it. To top things off, the pho was expensive.   I'd say the best part of the meal was the spicy chicken wings, which was the first thing we got and went down hill from there.  So we ordered chicken wings, summer rolls, 2 bowls of pho, 2 drinks and stir fry noodles with a side of rice = $60 including the automatic 18% gratuity from  the Living Social coupon. There a ton of other pho places in Phx where the same amount of food would cost $30-40. If you just wanna go for happy hour and/or some late night pho, be my guest!

I've never had afghani food, but if this is what its like...i love it! It's like a combo of indian and persian. The naan s not like the naan you'll get as an indian restaurant, but its still good, more crispy. We ordered the afghani kofta and mixed grill platter. I was a little worried about ordering the kofta because the grill platter is HUGE!. But after trying the kofta, I was glad I ordered it...juicy meatballs surrounded by well cooked and seasoned lentil curry. The meat from the grill is cooked well, not too dry. Sadly did not have room for baklava or any other dessert, but we did leave with a lot of leftovers. It's also at a good price point so they definitely have gained a repeat customer.

This place makes a mean grilled cheese with a great selection of cheeses. The quality is great and every time I go to the Phoenix Public Market on Friday afternoons for lunch, its always a toss up between this place and Short Leash because both places are top notch. My personal favorite of theirs is the Veggie which has roasted red peppers, provolone, tomato, basil, arugula and balsamic all for $6, which is not too bad considering the average market and cost of food truck food in  Phx.
