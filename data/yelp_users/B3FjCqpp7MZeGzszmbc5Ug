I was really hopeful that this would be a great grocery store when I moved into the area, but I was wrong!  1. The staff is non-existent and when you do find them, they don't smile or acknowledge you in any way. 2. The self-pay machine ALWAYS gives me issues 3. The choices of organic and natural foods are ABYSMAL. Unless you want highly processed crap, stay away.  4. They are going through a remodel, so things are spread everywhere and the store is a huge mess right now.  I want to give my business to locally owned companies, but we will be staying away from this one.

The staff here is what keeps us coming back. They are amazing, helpful and attentive. The food is good, nothing too fancy, but the kids love it and parents too.

My new favorite date night and girl's night out spot! Really happy to have a great place to go for wine, with wonderful recommendations from the staff too. The food was fabulous, the wine was divine, the ambiance amazing and the service spectacular.  I highly recommend the scallops and the charcuterie plate as well. Heading back tonight to enjoy a nice night out, kid-free, with my hubby. Can't wait to enjoy some great wine with delicious food.

First off, I am really happy that more restaurants are opening in Queen Creek and allowing something other than fast-food as our dining out options.   Next, I have visited Babbo's twice in the past month. The first time was to try it out with my family of 4, including myself, my husband and my 9 year old and 5 year old kids. The service was on and we never went without bread, drinks, food or a smile! We all had different pasta dishes, appetizers and the most wonderful tiramisu I have had in Arizona!  The second visit was when I hosted my sister's bridal shower at Babbo's. This was such a wonderful event from the beginning to the end. Danielle took great care to help plan the menu and arrange for the seating outside for 30 people. We customized the menu to fit everyone and the wait staff was amazing as people trickled in, making sure they all had drinks and were comfortable. The food came out a perfect times, we had nice cold salads and wonderful steaming hot main dishes. We were seated out on the patio and were lucky enough to have great weather!   Everyone had a great time, enjoyed the food and service. I can't thank the team enough for making the day such a success.
