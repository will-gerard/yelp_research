Tonight was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had! After waiting for over an hour, which was anticipated, we were seated in Christopher's section. We had a party of 6. I ordered the oysters to start and the same shrimp brochette entrée for both me and the boyfriend. After going around the table the server came back to me for an order. I reminded him that both my boyfriend and I were each doing the same entrée. Our server replied yes he understood. Well, when our food arrived it was one shrimp entrée and one oyster appetizer. We let the food runner know of the mistake. When the waiter checked in several minutes later, he simply let us know that it sounded like I had only wanted one entrée!?! No apology, no offer to send a  manager over. He came off very stand offish.  I waited 15 minutes for my entrée to finally make an appearance. After having to deal with a rude hostess and wait for such a long time and than to have such abysmal service, I don't know if I would ever go back. The food is good, but not worth the poor customer service.

Last night my boyfriend and I stopped at Brio to enjoy a little happy hour. We had taken our dogs on a walk through San Tan Village and grabbed a seat out on the patio. You really can't beat the HH specials. I wish I had gotten our server's name. She was great!!! So attentive, and really went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great experience.

I decided to stop in for lunch here just the other day. I was curious about the food and invited a friend to join me. When we got there we were the only ones in the resteraunt. They seemed to have many options as far as entrees. We decied to try the Pupusa combos. I also placed a to go order for some co workers. After waiting 30 minutes, our food finally arrived. I waited another 15 minutes for the to go food. The pupusas were rather bland. Having ordered the chicken, pork and steak. The chicken was the only one to have any real flavor. We also found the rice to be really boring. My co worker did really enjoy her chicken soup. Having only an hour for lunch, and the food taking as long as it did, I only really had about 7 minutes to eat. I'd like to give this place another chance maybe for dinner sometime. Lunch is definetly not a good option if you're on a time crunch.

This is one of my favorite spots for Thai! The service and staff are always stellar. I love the spicy fish and coconut soup. The papya salad is something everyone needs to try at least once.

Love this place! Dr. Mundt and Desiree are seriously great at what they do and are just the nicest. I've been going in for the laser hair removal, botox and vitamin drips. I can not even begin on how the laser hair removal has changed my confidence. I can not recommend this place enough for the services offered, professionalism and approachability of the staff. If you're even just thinking about taking care of that tattoo, hair removal or just a boost for your immune system go now!

The food was excellent!!! The steamed buns were amazing and quite creative. Everyone on the staff from hostess to busser were attentive and helpful. The Peking duck dumpling is a must. Will definitely be a regular spot from here on out.

This has become my favorite place to go for my nails! Having been a client of the previous salon, they have really turned this place around. They always do an amazing job and go above and beyond! The attention to detail and making sure their clients are comfortable is always a top priority. I've brought in pictures from pinterest and they've always been able to replicate every detail. If you're looking for a clean, welcoming and outstanding nail salon, this is the place!
