The service was perfect, the pork chop was delicious, and the zeppole was decadent. The presentation of the food was pleasant and the plate was full but not over crowded.   It is a large place that has live music. We enjoyed American guitar and singing. It is casual meets a touch of class.

The food here is disgusting. We had a variety of dishes and none of them were close to being Mexican or American-Mexican cuisine. The service was slow and the tables and floor were dirty. You're better off buying frozen Mexican food at the grocery store or cooking it yourself.

I've returned from living in Ireland and began a search for a local pub. This place is great. The service is fantastic,  both behind the bar and the servers, drink prices are reasonable and they make a delicious burger. They have a solid selection of beers available as well.

We have been here several times for breakfast and for lunch, during busy times and not. The service has always been spot on, the food cooked perfectly, and my wife and children enjoy it each time.  They also sell bread. Most store bought bread is mediocre and best. Here, they have delicious loaves of bread for sale. That and the cinnamon buns are brilliant.  The smoked meats are a nice touch as well. I have tried the pulled pork on a pretzel bun and it is delish.

Bacon, eggs and tomatoes on a pizza? Yes thank you I'll have another.  Gio's makes great pizzas. They have incredibly fresh ingredients and a few specialty pizzas that are extraordinary. I was skeptical on the Alba, mention end above, but Matt convinced me otherwise. It's a delicious combo.  The customer service was fantastic despite being massively busy. I'd say they rival some of the best pizzas around.
