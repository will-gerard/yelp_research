Blue Fin is within walking distance of work so I go once a week, I'd go more but that'd just be silly.  Speaking of silly, I order the same thing every week and all of the staff knows it!!   'The Healthy Special' - chicken teriyaki (white meat), veggies (carrots, broccoli, cabbage) on brown rice with a really amazing Iced Tea.  Delicious down to the last bite!  Locally owned and the staff goes out of their way to be as friendly as possible. Always smiling and always happy to see me.   It's also right next to a light rail stop which is OH-so convenient!

Best Sushi place I've been to, great food without the snobby ''sushi is so trendy' attitude and blaring music.  The staff is so friendly, the sushi is affordable --- we go there once or twice a month! Delicious!!!

This was my second visit to Arriba's and believe me, it wasn't my choice. I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.  When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, "Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican" and walked off. What?!?!  The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.  I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...  I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck.   If it wasn't for the delicious fresh chips, guacamole and two 99cent happy hour margaritas I would've been VERY unhappy.  I definitely won't ever be back and this time I mean it.

I'm pretty sure a majority of people that work here are volunteers, so the customer service is going to constantly change. I've met the same guy in there 3 times now and he's always super attentive and nice. The first time we went in there he gave us bottled water! My husband played a show here a few weeks ago and he went out of his way to bring me a chair - he also had his bizarre cat do some tricks for us! The art is wonderful and the prices are really affordable. I love that it's student work, fresh and modern and really intriguing. Honestly, it's the only gallery in old town that I could spend more than 20 minutes in.

Breakfast burrito's are pretty much my favorite food in the whole world. Fiesta's Country Burrito definitely contributes to this. Fresh tortilla, eggs, potatoes, cheese - add refried beans and their amazing green salsa... it's a beautiful thing, really.   Plus they have the best Dr Pepper ever, the perfect mix of carbonation and syrup.   It's also friendly, cheap, fast and a three minute drive from my house. LOVE

Went to the Rogue Bar for the first time last night, Lindsay one of the owners invited the band I'm in to play for Indie Night (thursdays) - I really had a great time! Everyone was soooo friendly and talkative, it's sort of rare for strangers to talk to me instead of snear at me in Scottsdale. Okay, there was a little of that with the bartender - I hope she doesn't read this, then she might have a real reason to act like she hates me? But maybe she just has to get to know you to warm up - that's how dive bars usually work. The sound system was pretty buzzy from bands playing mega-loud (see below reviews, I did and came prepared with ear plugs for the last band) - but friends said it sounded good and I didn't mind. We're playing again in September, I'm sure I'll be back before then.

I've been to Erika a bunch of times in the last 2 years. Her layers/texture are great and she's super nice and laid back. I had her dye my bleached/fried hair to my natural color and she matched it perfectly- amazing!   She does the long scalp massage too - sigh... so nice!

Dr. Soiya is the kindest, sweetest doctor I have ever been to. If you're impatient or in a hurry don't bother, I always end up waiting forever - even when I called ahead to see if he was running on time. It doesn't bother me though, because he sits there and listens and never rushes and remembers the little details that make you feel like he sincerely cares.

I've just been to Il Vinaio twice, both for breakfast... usually I go more before reviewing but the pancakes I had this morning were maybe the most delicious pancakes I've had EVER. They're buttery and moist and basically taste like cake. Who doesn't love cake, right? YUM.   Tried the blueberry crepes which were also fantastic. Service was amazing, super nice and attentive.
