I worked out at this gym for a little under a year between April 2012 to March 2013. I had recently moved to Phoenix from the Chicago-area and had been a member at my local Y in Illinois for 5+ years.   I'm not sure if my Illinois-based YMCA is just super nice and I had become spoiled, or what the deal is, but I found this Y disappointing.  I went in for a tour and membership info when I first arrived in Phoenix. The membership fee was around $50/month, which I found outrageous for the shape this place is in. It's older (though apparently recently renovated?), small exercise rooms, and a maze of floors/hallways/stairs.  I knew after touring the place I couldn't justify the price. I later found out that the Ys in the Valley participate in the fitness program through my medical insurance, which is $25/month -- that is the ONLY reason I decided to join. I signed up for my insurance fitness program, and presented the information to the Y. That, in and of itself, was a nightmare. I won't go into that in this review, though, since I joined at the Christown YMCA, and it wouldn't be fair to blame the downtown location for their issues.  Back to my review of the downtown location. When I first started coming regularly, their water machine was broken. Two weeks later, it was still out of order, and I have no idea how long it was not functioning before I joined.   I generally take group exercise classes at the gym, and this location offers a decent variety. Which brings me to my next issue -- the instructors. The ones I've had are generally OK, though I don't think the kickboxing class is nearly the great workout that everyone seems to think.  However, I will say that on one memorable occasion when I arrived to take a Spin class, I asked the instructor (politely) if we could please turn on the fans in the cycle room since it is tiny, has no air flow, and gets HOT as Hades. He replied, "I don't use fans in my class." Wow. I have never experienced such rudeness/arrogance from a class instructor anywhere previously or since.  I really love supporting YMCAs and helping the community, but I don't think I could justify the cost of this one in exchange for the facilities & service.

I recently moved to Phoenix from the Chicagoland area about 2 months ago. My 7-year-old Lab came with me, of course. As soon as I knew what part of Phoenix I would be living in, I started researching vet clinics, and had actually decided on the one that I would use for my Lab's annual exam and anything else that came up (hopefully nothing).   Well, something did happen. Two days ago, my Lab -- who has never in the 5 years since I adopted her has EVER been destructive -- tore into my bathroom garbage. I came home after being gone a couple of hours to find ripped up garbage all over my living room and bathroom. And this was not any garbage -- oh no. It was mainly comprised of *ahem* used tampons and pads. I even had the used Nuvaring in there. All chewed up.   She seemed fine; I cleaned up the mess. She was fine the rest of the day and the next day (Sunday). Seemed a-OK Monday morning before I left work. Was eating, pooping, happy. Came home from work Monday evening, and on our walk she started puking. Guess what came up? Tampons. And then tampons and pads. And bile. I hadn't realized she had actually EATEN any of this crap and started freaking out. The tampons had plastic applicators. I didn't know if she'd eaten any of those. I was having a nervous breakdown that the stupid dog had given herself an obstruction.   It was already after 6 PM. The vet clinic I had chosen was closed. My options were: a) don't take her in anywhere; b) take her to Alta Vista; c) find a true ER clinic. I called Alta Vista and was told I could bring her in and she would be seen as a "walk-in." The employee did tell me the walk-in appointment fee was $20 higher than a regular appointment -- it would be $65. That was how much I paid for a normal appointment at my clinic back in IL. I took her in.  When I got to the clinic, I had to wait a bit, but I didn't have an appointment for one, and I didn't even think the wait was excessive. I'm going to be honest here and say that I did not go into this clinic with high expectations. I have had numerous unpleasant experiences in the past at clinics that allow walk-ins. Usually the vets are pretty crappy and the employees in general are rude.  I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised. The tech was very nice, and I even really ended up liking the vet that came to exam my dog. I am notorious for being extremely picky with vets, and I'll admit to always being leery (I'm so prejudiced!) of male vets.   The vet that walked in was a Dr Marsh. He was very thorough and kind, gave my dog a REAL exam, and did not make the situation awkward AT ALL. And we had to speak repeatedly of pads, tampons, and Nuvarings.   My Lab received the exam and 3 x-rays. The dr showed me all the x-rays and explained the views and why he felt she would be OK and I should feel comfortable taking her home and just keeping an eye on her. I paid around $200 for everything, which I do feel is reasonable and fair.   If this vet is still employed by Alta Vista when Gracie's annual exam time comes, I will take her to see him. I am very lucky this clinic has such insanely great hours and is super close to my apartment.

I recently moved from Chicago area to Phoenix. I left behind a wonderful stylist and friend. I had no idea where to go in Phoenix. I spent quite a bit of time researching salons. I live in central Phoenix and I was having no success in finding a salon near my neighborhood that charged less than $45-$50 for a basic haircut. Maybe I'm cheap, but I find that price point ridiculous and I refuse to pay that much money for a simple cut.  I came upon this salon here on Yelp. I drove 25 minutes north to try it out, since the reviews were good and the price was reasonable. I called to schedule a cut and I spoke to the owner of the salon. She was extremely nice and was able to get in me in on that Sunday (I called Thursday). I was very happy about that.   I paid $21 for my cut (using the deal here on Yelp), and it was great. The salon is neat, clean, and cute. It is not super swanky, so if that's what you're looking for, I would go elsewhere. I don't need any of those pretentions. The owner was friendly, knew what she was doing, noticed a weird thing my hair does right away (that my Chicago stylist always had to work around), and is reasonable in her prices. I say that's a win.  She gave me several coupons for future cuts, and I'll be back!
