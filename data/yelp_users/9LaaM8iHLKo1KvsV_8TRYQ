I have to say this is my second trip and per my bride. Why have we never knew this place here. Surprisingly thirr Green Sauce delivered oh so good burn, chip's are one of my favorites possibly due to the light salt and fresh made daily tortillas. Tonight they ran out of Pollo for tacos ao the boy had beef (devoured as usual).  May need to join a gym   Later

For a place we drovr past and even ate qhyt Shwarma King called food. We got a flier on the door. So after running a few arrends called in the order with standard 15 wait time. Walked in after another guy, they inquired if I called in an order. I paid and decided to snap a few photos for their  Yelp profile. Went home and was Blown Away  Sizzling Roce Soup.... My wife was extremely happy  General Tso's Chicken diner... For my son was the best General Tso's I have ever had in 20 years House Fried Rice. ... Very flavorful, not greasy and fresh. Pot  Stickers were delicious.  Free order of Pork Fried Rice was perfect.   We suffered after New York Wok sold  Now we have a great go to  Time to hit the gym

so I ordered as usual not allot of waiting from order to window... I get to the window and the employee asks me my order... slightly annoyed I repeat it and he sass..." Your Order Got Deleted"... so I pay the $7.31.. Thinking the entire time.... (being a Ronald McDonald's graduated of 83') Errors like this is an "Automatic Free Meal".. Will have to email Corp office on my "Deleted Order"

Had a planned breakfast for my mother-in-law today and everything seems regular and ordered the Ultimate Skillet. And was almost done when I  hit a piece of bacon that for lack of a better term tasted like hand sanitizer. Or some chemical.  Wife confirmed  Spoke to management which said the would remove from the bill.  Strange

We decided to call ahead and make reservations, 745pm. We arrive early to find they have a Mother's Day special. Buy $50 gift card..  Get $10 Free. We said SURE. COUPLED with a 15% off a meal email. We ordered  Calamari Large...To Die for Ceaser saleds were Quoted as Great as a Point in Time Pasta Weezie Pasta Carrabba's  I decided to go with Shrimp Scallops Vokka Pasta. Sad ti say not bad for a red sauce was no contender to Weezie. Every bite my wife shared reenfiorced my going "Off Book" when comes to a frequent haunt of ours. So that was a good meal. Brittany Server was great. But the kid with the 90210 Hair can Kill an Arnold Palmer every time.

Great place we found an stopped the sad day I had to drop a goo d friend off at the human society across the street.  My wife was looking for a Pink Beach Cruiser an they ha the perfect bike. Like them so well I sold 10  year old Trek 720 Hybrid to a friend an found a nice gun metal mens beach cruiser for me.  Was a bit more than I wanted to spend at the time, but they are worth every penny  Great Honest guys, that even buy older bikes

This visit would have been a 5 stars Issue 1. Order was not put in on time  Created  Issue 2 . Waiting 30 minutes before the food finally came out.  As she was putting plates down i decided to asked  "what happened "...... to my complete Surprise Lucy owned it and said it was overlooked and she said it was her fault.  We were no worse for the wear   All and all mor a bad diner  Carne Asada Street Tacos were MONSTER.

So as a belated birthday, My family treated me to Joe's Crab shack, the anticipation was unreal.. so we roll in Saturday 06/02/2012. The drive was fast, and the  Location - Not bad to get to Appearance- Liked it Seating-  Ample ... although not sure whey a party of 4 was put in the party of 6 or larger but what ever. Service- Surprising SeaFood - NOT even CLOSE to the portions on menu or in the commercials Now Hamburgers and Fries---Awesome. Saddest moment in a very long time..  that the desert was better than the meal...  Sad part the"Hype"did not even come close...  Sad

So I just decided we needed McDonald's and after driving to the second and furthest from our house. We decide to do tye McPick. And after sorting out the titals for each. The bring it to the 2nd window with a strange " bye have a good night". Now I know why Weak Fries Cold sandwiches  So I drove back through advised them of this, tje really did not care nor go above and beyond.  And the same juvenile smartass did a fast handover and walk away.  This place is an early morning time suck. Next day issue still not sitting well with me I drove 5 miles to hear "if you would have called last night we would give you your money back... sorry ". More than annoyed I left... Handled arrends and still not happy drove back and just asked ro have 2 combo meals for my son. Bipriduct of a father who graduated from Hamburg University 1983.  I will make sure to Never drive or walk in.

UNCERTAIN WHY I HAVE NEVER ENTERED THE SANDBAR BEFORE....  But I know I will be rolling through on Thursdays a little more often..  So my boy gets a end of School year thank you gift of a Gift Card... Blessing that would help ease the pain....  We Park to see Mist Systems chilling the air and the outside bar...(we will check out later without the kids).. Walk in to 2 welcoming faces, the ladies showed us to a table, got our drink order, we were going to order our usual Mexican fair, but decided to hear what was on Happy Hour and Thursday Special.... Little did we know  They had a Chicken Chimichanga  that was normally $11.99 for $5.99 so I thought, sounds cheap i will order 2 one for now and one for Lunch tomorrow (Thank god tomorrow came, I will be brutalizing that Chimi like it was its first night in prison...lol)  But I digress, so we order the Chimi and notice we are just in time for Happy Hour to close out, Waitress Explains that its also Ladies Night and Ladies get drinks HALF OFF...! BOOYAH! so they have A Magical Margarita Machine .... Boy was it Magic... Nice stuff by the way, so we find out why they only have one size.... Cause its all you need.  Food gets delivered and presentation is nice, drinks are on hand and we all dive in... Then the surprise of the Spicy Smokey Chicken in the crispy hand made deep fried tortilla. Needless to say it was off the Chain and the guacamole was on-point, and I recommend ordering the extra at $0.50 per cup.  Needless to say i only needed water, cause the Tequila was working its magic..   diner was a hit and we will be back, the burgers were of the Rock Bottom of Arrowhead before they fell off...  And leftovers....wow........round two of Bring the Joy and Pain...lol

So we were up for something for diner and happen to have a Menu delivered from New York Wok and we ran through the menu and found our typical choices and called to hear a "Very Young female voice" taking the order. When we arrived we found a young brother and sister manning the register..Odd but she handled the transactions and everyone got the food they ordered. Drove home to some great smells  Got home and opened the bag to finger burning heat and an awesome  Egg Drop and Wonton Soup wife Loved it House Fried Rice was Awesome Orange Chicken was amazing and last but not least Sweet and Sour Shrimp was off the Charts  NICE WORK  keep it New York Nice work and we will back.  Thank you Diana Y. for the Review (I also hail from Wash D.C. area and miss the food...Don't get me started)  we read almost all of them and amazingly enough my wife thought it was worth the try and we are happy we did.  Yelp Ya Later

So we waited until the Re-Birth of New York Wok under New Management   Restaurant layout. .. Has more seating and they stream lined the counter. Moved the soda fridge by kitchen.   So we had the order and waited, and waited  Food was hot....... And then the wheels fall off! I love the food here and I have Lost that Loving Feelings   My order of Kung Pao Two. ... About the strangest,  light on sauce, heavy on fishy Shrimp! Uncoated Chicken. TOO DAMN MANY VEGETABLES! !  My sons order General Tso Chicken NOTHOT. .. WAS HOT. ... GREASY, STRANG  CONSISTENCY. .  THEY HAVE COMBINATION. ..hot to fet them is a Ancient Chinese Secret.   My wife asked if the Sweet and Sour Shrimp was heavily coated... They  brought out a very nice Butterflied Shrimp with a perfect amount of a tasty Tempora coating.   I have to say today was a sad, sad, sad day.  I thought long and hard and decided. .Its time for ua to Cook Chinese. I have several recipes and only need a few things. Thanks to a strong Asian Restaurant Supply selection of places to buy.  I am sure we will find our Happy Asian Place.  Thanks for the poor food and inspiration to cook it My Damn Self.  Ni Hoa, Hop Chung Mao

We had heard about them through a friend, and after diner out Thursday night we drove by B&L Pool Supplies and they were closed. The gentleman i spoke to was walking around inside and waived, pointed to his watch, shrugged his shoulders and walked into the dark of the back of the store. With that we called NorthWest Pool Supplies the next day and woman who answered the phone answered all my questions pleasantly and discovered that there prices were LOWER and bad a better selection with many choices. Very knowledgeable on all types of pools and pool needs. Puts the Hillbillies at B&L pools to shame. we have seen the light and will drive 5 miles when B&L is less than 200 yards across 43rd Ave.  Convert for Life,

OK So we were undecided on diner and Hot-dogs were on the tips of all bodies were in, so I suggested QT because of there AWESOME Grilled Section and Endless Condiment Choices. So we pop in just before 5pm. Prepare 9 Hot-dogs and "Sausage", which after the first try, discovered it is "Jacksonville Style Brat" that all specialty dogs were ( 2 for 2) Score.  Grabbed 4 drinks and napkins, and proceeded out to picnic table and chairs, because there is now a   Raising Canes and a new Buffalo Wild Wings, has enough traffic to kick back with Lawn Chairs and cold sodas and "Watch the Show"  RIDICULOUSNESS AT ITS FINEST

So  we headed to Arrowhead before the rain tolls in Sunday amd decided on diner at Paradise Bakery.  1. Got to Ordering counter and saw noone as we stood as the young minions were doing Minions things out of sight.  They flood in unorganized and taking orders out of order.   2. THEY take our salad order then take sandwich order. We notice she made my wife's salas with a non chelant care for the inquiry for Sunflower seeds.  Prepared my son's salad and deopped 1/3 of his bagged Chicken.  Proceeded to ignore that same fact and then cop an attitude when we ask if she was going to replace the Chicken.   3. As if we were inconvenience them any more asking if we get a cookie with sandwich. Met with silence and then they are served  when sandwiches come out   Over all sad compared to 11th Street  & Glendale.   Will not be returning

Its sad when many Americans are struggling they go and raise prices on a staple and wonder why on a Sunday Night there are only 2 customers.  You would think with a group of restaurants they have they would want to do Budget Buddy's like Uncle Sams's does. Guess 20 years of patronage counts for nothing.   Sad sad sad
