Wow, I am thoroughly impressed with every aspect of my experience with Shane Co.   BF has had an earlier experience (ahem) with Shane Co years ago and since then had only decided to conduct business with them from then on out. He's always raved about the customer service and I must say he was right.   A weeknight in October we arrived to pick out a bridal set for me. The selection can't be beat. We were greeted by every employee we walked by. Finally we met Ariana who spent what seemed to be 2 hours with us helping me find the perfect engagement ring and band. Not one second did I feel rushed or pressured. I went in that night with an idea of what I wanted and by the end of the visit I decided upon something even more amazing thanks to Ariana's help. It's an absolute stunning set. After finding the rings, we started the process of finding the perfect diamond to compliment. She worked within our budget and carat size and found us the most beautiful colorless diamond I had ever seen.   All the while, as she milled about the store grabbing different rings/diamonds for me she didn't have to snatch back the rings I already had picked out to compare and put them back in the case. That was great. I wasn't treated like a criminal like other jewelery stores. I was free to wear and gaze at them as she, truly, waited on us hand and foot. Meanwhile other staff would stop by and offer us coffee or water, or lighthearted conversation. We truly felt very special here.   To top it off their protection plan and free resizing/service for life is very comforting.   I had such a great experience I returned a few months later to sell some old (ahem) diamond rings and gold and had an equally perfect experience with Joe. They even allowed me to apply that cash towards the balance of my wedding set.   I too can't imagine doing business with any other company ever again. I'm glad we didn't "go to J****".  ;) What a huge difference all around. Why bother with anyone else?  Thank you to everyone at Shane Co. Scottsdale for making this one of the most magical experiences I've ever had. Anxiously waiting for the big question now so I can finally wear my rings!

Terrible grooming experience both times, I'm never coming back. My little yorkie's dew claws weren't trimmed, her head is buzzed while the rest of her body remained long. But most importantly (to me at least) was that the staff wasn't compassionate towards her at all which made me nervous to leave her with the grumpy groomer. My little girl is my world and I know she's apprehensive so a little cooing and not cringing at her kisses would make a huge difference when I hand her over. I'm so angry I wasted money here.

The only good thing about this place is their cheap, super-strong margaritas and it's close enough for us to ride our bikes to.   Otherwise it's the same menu as all the 'Berto's restaurants and Mixteca. I'm sure they all use the same food distributor too. I don't get why it's consistently busy.

I've been fortunate enough to have seen the same eye doctor my entire life. In fact my entire family sees him back home. Alas I've moved from there and now live in Phoenix. I was very apprehensive making an appointment at Target Optical, or with anyone else for that matter. Would anyone else match the care I've received my entire life? So about a year ago (2013) I made an appointment and had a really great experience. The doctor then was very professional, kind, and my Rx was perfect! Yay!  This past September it came time to have another exam and renew my Rx for contacts and glasses. Come to find out the previous doctor is GONE! Not sure where he went. I figured this new Dr. Piraino would be ok and boy was I wrong. The guy dresses in tight nylon shirts and jeans. Trust me, I'm not expecting a suit and tie but, c'mon, show a little professionalism. It was a Saturday and they were seriously overbooked. All seats were full, SRO. Whatever, I shrugged it off. He rushed me through my exam and I left very frustrated but glad it was over.  A few days later I received a call that my frames were in and ready to be picked up. This woman with a super strong accent helped fit them. I kept telling her that the Rx wasn't right. I couldn't see anything 6' in front of me. She assured me that it takes 5 days for my eyes to adjust to my new Rx. Um, okay. In the 25 years of wearing glasses I've NEVER heard that before. Usually I put on a new pair and they're great. Maybe a tad bit strong but you get used to it after 10 min.  I shrugged it off. Maybe she was right?  I gave it 2 weeks, until I got sick of the headaches and returned to see if they could help me. Dr. Piraino wasn't in but David (the only professional employee in the Optical center BTW, he's great) made me an appointment first thing the next morning and assured me that he'd speak to the doctor and get him in the loop before I arrived. Great! I show up 5 min before my scheduled appointment and guess who's not there! 10 minutes later, I can hear David on the phone in an irritated voice asking if Dr. P was on his way. Wow. At this point, his next patient shows up and we're both waiting. Just as I was getting up to reschedule, Dr. P finally rushes in 30 minutes late, clearly stressed. Did he not know he had to be at work that day? I tell him I have other obligations and I must leave. This seemed to have irritated him more and he said it would only take a moment. Fine. I'm seated in his chair and I explain my situation and he says I need to give it another week. WTF. I tell him my old glasses from my previous exam last year were fine, could I just get that Rx put in these new frames? He tells me that he's willing to go half way with the old and new Rx but no more. I'm so angry I'm ready to cry. He's treating me like I'm an idiot. How can you prove to someone you can't see?! I tell him I'll give it a few more days as he suggested because I just wanted to get out of there to call my Ins company to see if I could get covered for a second opinion from a different doctor. He says he'll mark my chart with that Rx he's compromised on and I can just stop in in the next few days if I change my mind. Ins company won't pay for a second opinion so I stop by Target the following week and guess who's not there and what's not noted in my chart? The tech (how many people work in here?!) offers to make an appointment for the first thing the next day and I just laugh and walk out.  Seriously, avoid this guy. I'm completely frustrated being left with a pair of useless frames and out $200. If anyone can tell me the name of the gentleman who was here before Dr. Piraino, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks to a fellow Yelper, I found my old doctor. Dr. Christopher P Marmo, now located at Welman Eye Center, FYI. Saw Dr. Marmo today and he confirmed my Rx was wrong and that in fact my Rx hasn't changed in 2 years! I'm headed back to Target to speak to the General Mgr to have these lenses fixed for good. I have the correct Rx to provide them. Hopefully I can get these glasses fixed and NEVER have to deal with this guy again!   Avoid Dr. Piraino, do yourself a favor and call Dr. Marmo. He's wonderful!

I'm a self proclaimed Mexican food junkie. I like it all. From fancy, overpriced designer tacos to IDK if I should be eating here type of places. El Norteno if my very favorite place to get a really great AFFORDABLE meal. When I say affordable, I mean Filiberto's affordable but the food is like you'd expect from a old school restaurant. The girl that works the counter is very friendly and helpful with suggestions.  I'd eat their Steak Picado plate every day of the week. Seriously. Their beans and rice are perfection. So are the tortillas. Green chile is super hot but can't be beat. The red sauce is great too. Order a side of chips and sauce!  Downsides:  The tiny ordering area indoors. No big deal but everyone seems to want to loiter inside making it hard to squeeze in there to place an order. I get it, it's hot out but c'mon y'all, be considerate and let others in to order. There is a small window on the outside you can use but it's usually used to pass out the orders.   The sketchy outdoor eating area. It just doesn't look clean. We always take our food to go and head over to a park to enjoy our food.   Other than that... BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN PHOENIX. Period.

Wow this might be the friendliest restaurant I've ever experienced. Our waitress was so sweet. Our drinks never went empty, and we were checked on repeatedly. She even suggested what to order next time.   I'm not a real big Chinese food fan so I really can't compare their food to other spots. We ordered the crab puffs which were tasty but I've had much better. Orange beef was pretty good but not spicy enough for my taste. It came with steamed or fried rice. I added a side of lo mein noodles because I was craving them. Those were really good. Hubby ordered shrimp lo mein and really enjoyed his meal. Serving sizes were really big and prices were reasonable in my opinion.   We will definitely return. It's a diamond in the rough.

Arch Robertson is a wonderful, compassionate man. He and his two techs administered an ultrasound to our Posey to determine if she would need surgery. Arch allowed us to stay in the exam room and he thoroughly explained everything on the screen so we understood completely. His "bedside manner" can't be beat and we felt at ease asking even the most simple of questions. His techs were wonderful too!   Thankfully he determined that Posey doesn't need surgery so hopefully we won't need to return anytime soon but I would not hesitate to recommend him and his staff to anyone in need of diagnostic testing.   The office is very clean and modern. Paola at the front desk is a real sweetheart too. We're so thankful to have had such wonderful care.   Thank you Arch and staff!!!

I have only been going for about 2 weeks now but I can say with complete confidence that the entire staff is outstanding.   Rich (my PT) is friendly, kind and professional. He listens to my concerns and explains everything in detail so I'm always on the same page. The PTA's remember me by my first name and genuinely care about my well being. I actually look forward to my appointments because I feel so welcome.

Sometimes a Yelp review isn't just about the food. Dining at a restaurant sometimes means more than just a good meal but a tradition that is more meaningful than one could express.  My family has been spending Sunday breakfast here for years. Each time, they request to sit in Christina's section. She remembers everyone's usual order right down to my Uncle's skillet without mushrooms. When I come home to visit my family she even remembers my usual "Moons" order! She's prompt, friendly and always greets us with a smile and even hugs my grandma. She doesn't seem to mind us lingering a while after we eat to visit with each other too, though we do try to free her tables up asap.   I can't express how much Christina means to not just my family but me. Since I no longer live in Vegas it's nice to know that she brings comfort to my loved ones. Sunday breakfast wouldn't be the same without her.   If you stop in, ask for her section. There's no doubt you'll be taken care of. Really though, everyone here is really great. Thank you Christina! I really appreciate your hard work and your kind heart. You're a lovely woman inside and out!

Pretty good for an occasional treat. Way overpriced for a basic cupcake (4 for $15). Peanut butter chocolate was the best of the four I tried. Banana was a runner up. The store is a little too small. Everyone wants to croud in to see what's available and the menu is hard to read.   The frosting is a bit too sweet for me as someone else stated. They sure are pretty though. Friendly staff too.  ATM is a dollar more per cupcake than buying from inside.   This won't be a regular stop for me.

We really loved living here.  The gym and pool area are really amazing. They have yoga classes and a roll up door in front of the treadmills which fills the room with fresh air in the cooler months. I never utilized the theater, does anyone? IDK. The pool area has really nice BBQ area with ceiling fans and TVs. They offer unattached garages for an extra fee and there's also a wine cellar if that's your thing.   The complex is smaller than many which makes it feel even more cozy tucked away against the mountain. I wouldn't advise anyone without a car to move in as the nearest grocery store is quite a trek. Close to PVCC, Costco, QT, Valero, Circle K, The Candy Store (if you're into that or looking for part-time work).  As for the office staff, we've never had an issue. They've always been friendly and helpful. I would return.

Ugh this location is so frustrating. It's the only one on my long commute to work that's easy to get to. It's always busy but not for the right reasons. I can only speak for the drive thru but it seems as though there's only one person running the register and making the drinks. The other 5 employees are standing around. Guess that's why I never see the same person at the window for too long. They must hate being the only one who works and eventually quits.   3 times out of 5 my drink is wrong. For some reason they can't get a regular mocha and a white mocha straight. For me, Starbucks is a treat. I budget for one or two stops each month. So, I look forward to it. Unfortunately I haven't leaned I need to budget more time for it too because I can't usually wait for them to remake my drink.   Terrible customer service too.

I'm on the fence about this place. It's a beautiful and from what I can see, a clean place. I was told the groomers use scissors and I believe this to be true. It makes me a little nervous but I'm not a pro so maybe it's how good groomers work. The ladies at the front desk aren't the friendliest at times. They're a little pricey too.  My main pet peeve is that every time I pick up my baby girl only a few of her nails are clipped. Like every other one!! I tell them every time that she has one rogue dew claw that wasn't removed so they don't forget to trim that one too and sure enough they forget every dang time.   You have to pay first before they'll go and get your dog from the back. So if you would like to leave a tip and only have your card, you don't have the opportunity to evaluate their work before deciding on an amount.   I'm in the process of researching other groomers. I don't have time, nor should I have to return to have them finish the job they should've got right the first time. Bummer because I think they're kind to my pup and that's hard to find.   Pro: they're better than the dirt bags over at Petsmart.

My BF and I have both been back to Posh Wash with much better experiences.   I was told by the lady behind the counter (I really need to take the time to get her name, she's great) that they had been going through a staff issue and things should be cleared up now and it seems it has. I'm so glad because it really is a great place and it's really hard to find people who are genuinely kind and caring towards our dogs. I should've taken into account a possible bad day or behind-the-scenes issues.   On my most recent visit after my last review, they had taken great attention to detail and my "little one" was returned to me looking perfect. I was also given an apology and explanation for our past issues. I appreciate having my concerns taken to heart and followed up on. That says a lot for their integrity and professionalism.   My BF this past week returned with our "big one" for a DIY wash and was very impressed with the cleanliness and amenities of the wash stations. He stated he was patiently walked through the entire process and was even given tips on how to keep her shedding under control.  So glad we've got a great place we can count on to care for not only our girls but our concerns. Thank you Posh Wash!

We have since moved to Flagstaff and still make the trek down to the valley for our Posey to be groomed here when we can. It's worth it. There is no comparison. She is consistently cut perfectly, no wonky uneven snips, or missed details and she is returned to us her usual happy self.   Liz is always friendly on the phone and in person. We truly appreciate the kindness and attention our little one receives. Posh Wash is truly a gem.

I'm so disappointed!  This is my second visit to Thai Original BBQ.  We ordered Shrimp Pad Thai and Beef with Broccoli, both were very, VERY salty.  MSG?  I'm assuming so, as I had a horrible headache for the rest of the night.  My Pad Thai wasn't very flavorful and the Beef with Broccoli looked so gross I didn't even want to taste it.  We ended up tossing it all and having cereal instead.   Sadly, I won't be back.  If you need me, I'll be at Archie's or Pin Kaow.  Where the service is just as friendly but the food is beyond amazing.

I needed a simple battery replacement in my Fossil watch. I based my decision on yelp reviews and vicinity to my  home, and I'm glad I stopped in.   The gentleman replaced my battery while I waited. Took less than 5 minutes and we chatted while he worked. I didn't get a dishonest vibe from him as the other Yelper suggested. Not in the slightest. In fact I found him to be friendly and warm. I have some old jewelery I've been meaning to do something with and I'll most likely return to The Jewelery Hospital check out my options.   FYI: the shop is located inside a barber shop, don't drive past it!

I'm torn. The 40 minute wait in line at 11am on a Tuesday was a little off putting. Especially when the entire front dining area was empty yet there were about 6 servers milling around. If we had known there was a counter and we could seat ourselves we would have done that but the hostess was a mute and didnt speak to anyone. Customer service was atrocious. A guy literally threw the silverware down and said, "What do you want to drink?". Uh, alright, good morning to you too! As we read over the menu I'm hearing screaming coming from the back of the kitchen. Then from the back of the other dining room. Then from behind the line. Then from behind the counter. Turns out it was the manager. No wonder the staff were so rude they have to put up with that sea hag all day. Maybe if she put more energy into mopping the grubby floors she'd be too tired to be so nasty.  The pancakes really were the best I'd ever had though. OJ was super fresh. I also ordered a hamburger patty on the side. That was pretty good too. Thankfully I'm not a big pancake fan because I'm not sure I'll be back. Bummer.

According to Google they're open until 9. So BF and I were on a late night donut and coffee run. I'm not a fan but I love him so I agreed to go there.) We arrived at 8:15 last night to find no donuts except a half dozen already boxed. And no coffee. They already closed up the machines for the night. So... why are you even open? Look I'm not expecting every item on their menu to be available at the last hour of the day. I'm not unreasonable. But give me something! No coffee? Isn't that what everyone loves so much about this chain?  BF grabbed the boxed donuts and they at least gave him a discount. They should've been free. It included 3 inedible dried up plain cake, a filled that looked like someone pushed their thumb through it, a chocolate cake glazed that either had a bite taken out of it or a piece torn from it but I wasn't going to take any chances.   Again, I'm not expecting morning fresh donuts at 8pm, but those shouldn't have been offered to anyone. Thinking about it, I'm not sure I've ever had a fresh donut from DD. I do however, expect coffee to be available until 9 if that's how late you're open. Not acceptable. Good thing there was a Starbucks next door. I know I can count on them to provide until the doors close.

I'm not sure how to rate this review as I've never been given a chance to see inside the home or its grounds. I have left numerous emails and messages with no reply.   I drove by last week to at least see the front exterior and it looks nice. Their website and many reviews of the home and it's owners are really great. But I've run across a few lately that had the same issue with no returned calls or emails. I'm so bummed because it truly seems like the perfect venue for us.  Are you closed for good? Are you so booked up you have no time to respond? So frustrating! :(

This is a really nice place. Looks very clean, bright  and they may be making cosmetic improvements. The machines are nice and there are 3-4 different sized washers available.   The coin less card system is the only downside.  Especially if you're not a regular. I now have a laundry debit card full of credits that I can't use for a while as I have my own w/d at home and only came to wash my bed spread. Guess I can load up some linens or towels to get done at once.   I'll be back, not only because I have to, to use up my card, but it's a clean place and the very first laundromat I've been in that didn't have roaches creeping around or bums begging for money. Bonus!

Once a loyal customer to the NV UT and AZ locations, I'll never return to a Cafe Rio or recommend it to anyone again.   Open your eyes, listen to your customers, check your Yelp reviews. Heck, check your dang feedback inbox! I've written twice to headquarters regarding their customer service issues without response. What's happened to your food quality, your once outstanding service and pride? Every single AZ location is absolutely horrible in every aspect. The strawberry lemonade machine has been broken for MONTHS yet you still try to serve stagnant lemonade that results in a cup full of iced pulp.   I keep giving you second shots but now I'm done. Your food is sub-par at best. Over salted, under cooked or just plain out of stock. I won't even get into the absolutely ridiculous service. I shouldn't have to wait for your cashier to finish shoving a donut into her mouth before she decides to ring up my order. The manager is quick to insult you or roll his eyes when you attempt to bring up an issue. I'm done. Chipotle is better and fresher anyway. At least I can count on a consistent meal from them. The larger you've grown the worse your brand has become. Cafe Rio, nice knowing you.

So, corporate finally responds to one of my emails from 5 months ago with a curt apology and offer me a free meal. Yeah, no. How about a refund from the last 6-8 terrible meals and equally horrid service.   I don't miss you Cafe Rio!

I'd never had a shave ice until today and I'm so glad my first try was from Kamana'Wana.   I wasn't really looking forward to it because I despise sno cones but my goodness, these are so different! Nothing at all like those hard crunchy, watery things you get at the fair only to eventually spill it all over your Poison shirt you had just expertly fringed and added beads to. The boys over in line at the Gravitron will never let you down for that!  Joking aside, the atmosphere is super clean and welcoming. There were a few people ahead of us and the lovely man behind the counter mentioned it might be a bit. No problem! This is a Hawaiian treat, you have to be on island time here. We grabbed a seat and bopped to the reggae as we waited. The portions are HUGE so I ordered a small black cherry (I'm a chicken, I'll admit it!) with ice cream and a snow cap. Watching him make it was so fun. He takes his time and you can tell he truly cares for his customers by churning out a beautiful cup of heaven.   It's a must that you order it with ice cream and a snow cap. The texture of the ice mixed with the ice cream is such a fun and unusual experience. I can't wait to return!

One of my favorite hometown stops on our way in to Vegas. It's a must every time.   Chilly Jilly'z embodies exactly what BC is known for. Friendly people and outstanding service. It's consistently spotless and the staff go out of their way to help you or suggest something new. Now, on to the Dole Whip and Broaster chicken.   Remember Disneyland's Tiki Room with the birds? Remember cooling off with that pineapple treat? Well, it's here and it's exactly how you'll remember it. BUT they have like 3 other flavors. Raspberry, get out of here, it's so good! Just enough tartness and sweet it's so refreshing. But my very favorite is orange. Mix it with a little vanilla froyo and it's like eating a baby aspirin. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about people. I get so excited about it. Dole freakin' Whip, you guys! Yes!  If you haven't experienced Broasted chicken, you haven't yet lived. I can't even explain it. It's kind of crisp like fried but it's cooked in a pressure cooker of sorts so the meat is juicy and tender. Lordy.   Do yourself a favor the next time you're getting dragged by the out-of-towners to see the dam tour for the 100th time (locals, you feel me?), or you're on your way to Vegas from AZ, or heck just make a day out of it. Boulder City is so great! Stop in and see the ladies at Chilly Jilly'z, they'll make you happy. I swear.

I love great customer service so I'll start with that first.  Heading up to Flag for the day we decided to stop in Anthem for a bite to eat. We passed a highway sign for donuts and the Mr. can't ever resist donuts so the decision was made to stop in. We walk in and I look around for a donut case and didn't see one so I must've had a confused look on my face because Brandon behind the register greeted us and asked if we had been in before. He then explained the concept. Each donut is freshly fried to order then you pick your toppings. Wait, so, it's not a donut made 6 hours ago?! Sign me up!   We ordered the following: Banana bread - dipped in banana frosting, and I think cinnamon and sugar and then dipped again in chocolate chips.   Peanut butter & bacon - simple, dunked in PB and fresh (real) bacon  Peanut butter cup - dunked in PB and then in chocolate chips  Maple bacon - maple sauce and big bacon crumbles.   We inhaled them so quickly I forgot to snap a pic!   The donut alone, we agreed, might be the best cake donut we've ever had. Light and airy with a crisp outside. Perfect base for the toppings. Each frosting had just the right amount of flavor but not overpowering. They're hot so the chocolate chips kind of soften up and meld with the frosting. It's pretty dang good, you guys!   Plus they're affordable at under 1.50 each. You can't beat a gormet donut at a decent price.  Thank you Brandon and "Employee #5" for making us feel welcome and making superb donuts. Fantastic concept! We'll be back!

Dr. Christopher Marmo is wonderful. I saw him a few years ago and lost contact after he moved his practice. Thanks to a fellow Yelper I was able to find him again. He offers services at two convenient locations. One in Peoria and the other Downtown. His downtown office is very nice. Dr. Marmo is warm, listens to all your concerns and an all around upbeat guy. His office assistant, awesome as well, even offered some information on how to remedy a bad Rx provided by another doctor.   Look no further, if you want top notch eye care he's your man.

We showed up on a Saturday around lunch time. I was surprised it was still open for the day. Bonus! We were expecting it to be closed. The line wasn't super long but it was hot and muggy out. A very nice older gentleman was milling around though, offering water and lighthearted conversation while we waited under the Easy-Up with misters installed. All in all it took us about 20 minutes to get into the building. They really do their best to make your wait as comfortable as possible. Thank you LMB!  We finally made it indoors (thank god) to find a small counter and small eating area. Another gentleman who I assume is the owner was at the helm offering up samples and suggestions. We ordered the brisket and pulled pork, cheese grits, beans, and potato salad. Oink! Gladly paid with a debit card as a lot of mom/pop places only seem to take cash. Nice surprise. Made our way to an indoor table and chowed down.   The brisket was really good. I'm sad though that 1/3 of my portion was mostly fat. I know a lot of meat fans are into that but it creeps me out. So I usually cut it off and hand it over to the BF. This stuff was so tender I literally had to use a spoon to eat it. I couldn't keep it on my fork! The pulled pork was very delicious. Not much flavor, but subtle. Not a dry piece of meat on our plate (we shared). Their sauces are the best I've tasted, I tried all three that were on the table. Grits were great, beans undercooked for my liking but great flavor, and the potato salad was my favorite.   This isn't a place I'd frequent in the summer months. By the time we got to our table I was a sweaty miserable mess. Indoors is only slightly cooler than outside. The tables and sauce bottles were filthy and everything felt grease covered. I've never ate anywhere that made me immediately want to go home and shower before I continued with the rest of my day.   I think the temperature is something I personally have an issue with, I don't blame LMB. So really, the only complaints would be that things need to be wiped down more often. The sauce bottles were just caked in half dried/half sticky sauce. It was gross. Also I feel it's a little overpriced for the portion but not so much that I wouldn't return. Just not as often as I'd prefer.   A solid BBQ place with really great people working it.

I stopped in one weekend to check out Rusty Saturday because I wanted to see The Salvage Yard which is in the back of the building. It's a really cute store, staged perfectly. I gather there are several businesses within that have have their own corners of the store. Super cute vintage finds, re-purposed items and new creations as well.   I'd definitely return if I were to need something I couldn't make myself. The ladies in the store are really friendly too.   My only regret is leaving the store without a vintage metal Care Bears lunch box exactly like I had as a child. ::cries::

This pains me to leave a 2 star review. I was so excited Dan had opened up a new spot and once we heard about it, we placed it on the top of the list for the next time we were in the area.   We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon after the Melrose neighborhood street fair. The parking lot was full but it looked as though everyone was at the french place next door. Upon entering we were promptly greeted with a very friendly and easy going lady. After scanning the menu I ordered a carne asada burrito and the Mr ordered the shrimp tacos. We sat down and she brought us chips and mentioned the salsa bar. I don't recall if the salsa was good so I won't comment on it. There were maybe 3 or 4 different ones to chose from. The atmosphere was clean, and it had some great local art on the walls. It was dead for a Saturday I thought but ok by me.  Our food came and it wasn't very exciting looking. My burrito was packed with watery bland pico and flavorless mushy carne. The bottom of my tortilla was so soggy I needed to use a fork to eat it. I had to douse it with lime juice and salsa to make it only slightly edible. Mr's shrimp tacos were bland as well. Maybe it was on off day but we were so disappointed. :( I think we'll wait a while before we come back. I do want to give MMT another shot but it won't be for a while.

Formerly The Lodge at Arrowhead Towne Center  I've lived here off and on for about 3 years, in 3 different floor plans. I can say that the layouts are really great, especially the one bedrooms. They're slowly renovating the units but it's not too much of a change. New higher end vertical blinds, and black appliances are the only things I've seen change. The office and pool is under renovation and the gym too which badly needed an upgrade. Who uses a rock wall? I can imagine that with the name change and the renovations, the rent will go up a bit but it really is a nice complex. I'd move back if I had to.   Pros:  Floor plans Interior stair wells 1 and 2 car garages. Some with drive-ways! The grounds are immaculate There is plenty of uncovered parking for guests Crime free Faux wood vinyl flooring on the first levels (great for pets) Maintenance staff is top notch. Great group of hard working guys. Separate laundry room. Joe is really the only person we've dealt with in the office but everyone is friendly and attentive. Direct key card access to a walking trail.  24 hour gym and pool. Complex location is tucked away in a residential neighborhood behind some office buildings. You can't see it from Bell Rd.  Pet friendly, plenty of dog stations and they keep the bags stocked up. They offer parties with free food from time to time if you're into that. Quiet complex. I suspect the majority of people there are Northwestern students.   Cons: Some of the residents don't care to pick up after their pets but that's anywhere, right? Depending on what side of the complex you live on, you might have an issue with snails, and water bugs. Installing a better door seal helped with that as they would come in under the door after a rain or sprinkler watering. The pool is constantly crowded in the summer with obnoxious kids screaming. Same with the volleyball court/giant litter box. Residents allow their kids to treat it as a sand box. Sand is everywhere and if you've got the wrong shoes on, you could slip on it. Electric ranges At the time we signed our first lease, April lied to us about certain things to get us to sign. The bright side is she's no longer there.  No medicine cabinets. Gardeners are there constantly and seem to work on the same little area for the whole day.  I wish they offered paint schemes like some other higher end apartments do.  The regular mailman is great but his alternate I think just balls up the mail and aims for any open box. I was constantly getting mail that isn't addressed to me. But that was only once a week.  There is one large trash compactor and it's full after just 4 days so you're forced to leave your trash laying next to it. It's behind a brick wall so you can't see it but I feel bad for the guys who have to pick it all up every week. The concept is great but it's not large enough for the complex.
