A terrible HH!! We brought 20 people for a pre-homecoming party... All purchased alcoholic beverages- some ppl multiple beverages .. Food consisted of three banquet trays( one nacho, one enchilada, one chingalinga) HH was suppose to last until 6.30 food stopped at 5.45. Servers kept pushing he expensive stuff . We will head somewhere else with our dollars .. Great example of sad hour ... Nothing happy her

Had to give it one star b/c couldn't give it ZERO.   This is not female friendly - women (not those in drag), but women are charged a cover to get in. This is a guys only bar - even though they will tell you otherwise. They are not about equality - yuck!!!

Dropped by for happy hour at this iconic mexican food space in Old Town. extremely disappointed. HH is only in the bar. The bar only had seats AT the bar - the remainder of the bar was dark - no lights turned on. We asked if we could go into the bar area for HH and were told, no, there is no room. We took our money and our appetites to Cien Agave  down the street. will probably not return to Los Olivos....

Fun menu with interesting selections and some standbys. Recommend outdoor seating on a cool afternoon.

This low rating is due to the condition of theater five. Was there for a showing of Learning to Drive on 9.25.15. Upon entering the theater I was greeted with a foul odor.. It was more than just "people" odor -- it was a repulsive, need a deep cleaning odor. Additionally - there is one entrance; one exit .. No fire escape. And it is a small screen. As a long time resident of Phoenix, I appreciate the architecture of this space-- bust something seriously needs to be done should it have any continued success .

Wil definitely be back to this neighborhood, family owned establishement. Hospitality and service was outstanding! Beautiful cut of prime rib served with perfectly blended horseradish and a side of au jus. Salad bar was a full salad bar. I came in as a solo diner and was treated wonderfully. The only draw back is walking through the outdoor smoking section to enter the restaurant.  Probably would not bring younger kids, but this is a space that older school age kids could experience a really great meal without too much expense.  did not use the check-in bonus as I checked in after I ate --

Brought two newbies with me this time. As always great service coupled with great food. Prime rib was perfect with the baked potato prepared with slight crunch to skin. One diner said best prime rib in the valley. The other dining partner commented that the filet was perfectly cooked and would be back for another visit... Two new patrons .. Thx Feeney's

Three cheese dip is a must do appetizer. Had the shredded pork which was more like cutlets - great taste was just surprised with the presentation .. Will revisit for other items that were tempting

Consistent, solid food. Good green chili, excellent machaca, great and quick service. Standby is the machaca plate- well seasoned, long grain. Fairly warm during the dog days of summer -- recommend take out. Saturday at lunch is very busy - call ahead for takeout. Menudo on Saturdays!!

Came to dreamy draw to establish care. My little guy was a little nervous and the doctor was excellent with keeping his anxiety level down and assessing him completely. Very happy with this facility and will be a regular customer.

Have been a customer with Community Tire Pros & Auto Repair for a while now. Recently relocated and needed to switch to another location for service. The "new to me" location was just as friendly, knowledgable and helpful with the maintenance on my vehicle as my standby location. Manager on site, owner on site. Great service, great prices. -- check out the community garden too (Durango Street location)

Needing some great comfort food served up with a smile? Or perhaps some awesome choices for dessert? This is a go to place. Plenty of seating, good service , solid food- sandwiches, salads , soups and sliders are awesome.

Coffee roasted on site - Sunday afternoons. Good coffee, usually quiet atmosphere. very nice staff. sanwiches are a bit over priced, but taste good. Focus on the coffee and you will do well. Have gotten alot of work done here and have held many meetings outside.

This the best yogurt stop!! Extremely friendly staff, very helpful and personable. Regular flavors a with a few rotating seasonal flavors. Spotless clean! Great selection of toppings -ALWAYS fresh and tasty. We make the drive a few times a week and know it is well worth it!  Have watched several beautiful sunsets from the patio seating.

One of my favorite spots inPhoenix to grab a good bite to eat and a good marg. taco tues is one of the best deals around.. They also have items that are not on the menu... So ask about them .. I will get the veggie burrito  add a protein and smother it in green sauce for a special treat

Very disappointed ... WARNING ... Worse than proverbial used car sales man ... I purchased personal training sessions (of course under contract for one year). I did not use them all and wanted to cancel the contract. Of course I could cancel the contract , but all unused personal training sessions not used to date ---- I lost-even though I paid for them - unless I wanted to extend the contract for $90/month.... Then I could use them. Buyer beware.. It was a significant loss ..

Fun atmosphere with very helpful staff. Menu include tequila flights - dependent upon your wallet, street taco - order three and add a side. The tortillas are made the same day -- super fresh and tasty. I tried the pork adovado and shrimp .. the pork was one of the best tacos I have ever had. the shrimp was tasty. Sat at the bar - bartender John.. great attitude and service. only draw back was the marg - only had it frozen on happy hour - would have like it on the rocks at happy hour price ($5) -- having said that - it was a good marg.

My new spot for green chili stew... 5.99 for a bowl of the best, most perfectly spiced hatch beef green chili! Fry bread adds 2.00 to the bill. Very friendly counter service. A small store off to the side with artisans and their work while you wait delivery of your food. My partner in crime ordered the cheesy fry bread.. It was excellent. I will b back for more taste testing in the near future! Thanks for being here!! Don't let the parking lot fool you--the good stuff awaits you on the inside.

Waited to review until all the freshness had worn off. Great experience - except for parking.. but this whole area is horrific for parking. Awesome, cocktails had the Moscow mule ala Joyride -- yummy... ... really great and unique food.

This place is good, really good. They have 5 different meats ranging in spice warmth - each with their own distinctive flavor. I enjoyed all five. I chose the three taco plate with pastor, green chili and one other beef. Incredible flavors on all of the meat. Then you have the opportunity to select various toppings, cilantro, lettuce, red onions, white onions, hominy, sour cream, cheese, cabbage (a few more I do not recall). A few salsa options are available also. Note: these are not street taco size they are full size soft shell tacos. I will be back to support this awesome restaurant

Oh my!! Really wonderful food. Some of the most attentive servers around. Smells wonderful as you enter. Lamb korma is incredible. Order family style and share. Indian beer available, good wine list- a bit pricey. If you want to secure a seat call for reservations as seating is slim esp. During summer when outdoor seating is not an option
