For those of you that think that Starbucks serves up a great cup 'o joe, you will be blown away by Jolta Java.  Their coffee isn't burned like Starbucks.  The owners take great pride in choosing well crafted coffee from various coffee plantations.  Teas and iced coffee and espresso beverages round out the coffee menu.  Unlike many other coffee places, the owners also are trained culinary chefs and have many delicious sandwiches soups and salads daily.  Their food and coffee are truly awesome.  Jolta Java is located at the S/W corner of Scottsdale Rd and Acoma

Mimi's cafe is the closest thing we have here to a typical NY diner.  There is a wide selection of food and everything is very flavorful.  There is a French/Cajun atmosphere to the restaurant, but don't worry, the menu isn't laden with crawfish and jambalaya.  My favorites are the Corn Chowder, the Liver and Onions (ask for the pot roast gravy on the side with it), Eggs, sunny side up with the breakfast potatoes.  Their coffee is alright too.  Other recommendations include the Filet of Sole and the Parmesan crusted Chicken.  This is a family restaurant, so don't be afraid to bring the kids.  Their burgers are great too.

NYPD claims to taste like NY pizza because they use "Yonkers water" in their dough.  I grew up in Yonkers. My benchmark is Carlo's Pizza at the corner of Central Avenue and Tuckahoe Rd.  That is my neighborhood.  Yonkers wins the NY State water flavor championship on a yearly basis, so to make such a claim piqued my interest.   NYPD is some of the worst pizza I've ever had in my lifetime.    We ordered pizza with tomatoes on top.  When I picked up the pizza and brought it home, I realized that the tomatoes were stale.  Yes they gave me a refund, but anyplace that serves pizza with stale toppings isn't worth my time.  I've never eaten there since.  If you want authentic NY Pizza forget NYPD and go to Ray's at the corner of Pima and Frank Lloyd Right.

Growing up in NY, Sam Ash was THE place to go to buy guitars, amps and such.  Prior to moving to Arizona, I only shopped at Sam Ash.  It's always been the music shop for musicians.  When I moved out here in 1998, I went to Guitar Center, while their prices weren't bad they move guitars like Home Depot moves lumber, they aren't interested in the product to match your needs, they're more interested in how much you have to spend.  At Sam Ash, they make a full attempt to match your budget with the gear that will get you the most mileage.  And unlike other smaller music shops locally, Sam Ash lets you take down the guitars and play them, and they know the features of the guitars and amps.  They have the cheaper lines of guitars such as Brownsville and Epiphone and they have other lines such as Ibanez, Taylor, Washburn, Warwick, and ESP.  Moreover, they have a great repair department.  Phil completes repairs on time and within budget, whether it's a pickup installation to a basic setup.

Coming from NY, diners are a mainstay.  Basically they are family restaurants with monsterous selections of both comfort food and complex offerings as well.  Here in AZ, it seems the the word diner means 50's style retro restaurant (life 5 & Diner).  Walking into the Black Bear Diner, I had high expectations, great interior a moderate selection of food, but still the retro 50's selection.  Boy was I disappointed.  First my hamburger was only adequate, and my son's chicken nuggets were store bought frozen food as well as the smiley fries that came with it that he doesn't like.  As well as the wait time for the food, was unreasonable.  So such a long wait for crappy food is not a good experience make.  The ambiance is nice but with such poorly prepared food and horrible wait times, it makes it hard to want to return.

I was never a fan of Indian food until I found Indian Palace, now at their 3rd location in less than 10 years, and despite that the location keeps changing, the food stays consistent (which is a rarity).    Their lunch buffet is one of the most diverse I've ever seen from an Indian restaurant, with 2 rice dishes (bryani and basmati), several vegetable dish choices and several meat choices.  small tossed salad and dessert as well at chai round out the offerings.  My favorites are the Chicken Tikka Masala, Bryani and spinach, but I eat almost everything there.  It is the best Indian food I've had...ever.
