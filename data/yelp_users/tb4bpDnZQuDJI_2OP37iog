Terrible pizza. It was as hard as a piece of cardboard. Just terrible. I specifically asked for well done chicken wings, they were raw and gross. They dumped bar be que sauce on top. Messy.  Gooey.  Raw.  This restaurant has done nothing but gone downhill. We all hated it.  I am positive the wing request was totally ignored, double cook please ! The over done pizza was inedible. Avoid this place.

this is an edited review.  Creative leather is fixing my sofa. I thought the sofa was collapsing. It is not, the cushions are flat as I thought Down fillingwas the best....they are very difficult.  Creative leather is replacing, free of charge, all of my cushions to a more sturdy foam. Even though things went wrong I know that I will be happy in the end   The show room was georgous. The furniture is beautiful, I am so happy I don't have to replace.

Much better...new manager I think?  I've been coming here forever and was about to give up...I am glad I didn't.  Lunch has been great lately, they give you a 10$ coupon every time for the next lunch. Just log in take a survey get a number.....so generous. Huge servings. Hot hot soup, excellent salad. Great sashimi....give them another try. One word to corporate, please remodel the disgusting women's  bathroom...it is dark.  Freezing, music is blaring. The stalls doors are broken, the hot water spigot is broken......I cannot stand this bathroom. It is raunchy.  The walls are a deep disgusting red with shitty shitty art decoupaged to the walls.  This bathroom is nasty....I think you could find the capital to do a redo....I bitch about it enough and will post photos next time I visit. Please inspect your properties.

This restaurant is expensive with poor food and service. Not very clean and not very cool.  They ripped me off on the guacamole and the sour cream   Both were 5.00 offered with the dish, the up charge was not disclosed.

I felt as if I was eating at a hospital cafeteria. The food was cold with no flavor. Everything was terrible -I read the above reviews and was surprised.  The room is loud and crowded. The dinner service was just like Denny's. The price is debatable - too high for third rate awful food. Did i miss something? I asked for recomendations.....i ordered the dish my server said was very good . I had their chicken schnitzel , no flavor,  their potatoes, no flavor and the awful salad , a bowl of coleslaw -brown and vinagary. For the record I am a good cook, I use seasoning! I don't serve ice cold food.  Their prices, for you get, are outrageous , it really was cafeteria quality or airplane..........

Customer service is a joke. My husband ordered a sale Gucci handbag for my birthday. After being sent thank you for your purchase e Mails I suddenly , one week later, received an email saying the order was cancelled....and, the bag is no longer available.   No one called or contacted me that I didn't have enough room on cc.  When I called customer service. Denise Stevens, I was lied to, she said I was e mailed 7 times and called 4.  When asked to prove this she couldn't.  Of course not, as no one called or e mailed me at all.  I am very disappointed as it is a birthday gift from my husband.  I will also complain to consumer affairs. What a cold hearted horrible store.

I had a very good problem resolving talk with customer service, headquarters. They were very fair.....it should not have happened but they did extend a similar discount on a new, not sale bag......I will miss my dream Gucci but doctors say I will live.

I give up.  This joint smells great from the street but The pizza tastes like shit. The waiter must have been having a sales contest as he kept pushing a 60 dollar bottle of wine.....to wash down this swill?  The red sauce has no flavor. The garlic will leave you reeking for hours. The salads are ok, nothing special. I guess, if you have kids and need to eat this is alright but not a destination by any stretch.

This was a disappointment. The food was nothing special. It was salty and heavy.  We were a party of four and we all felt Ill the next day. Great setting for drinks. I would not eat there again, I'm not that picky.  I actually makes me sad to leave this review. The state of restaurants in Phoenix is pathetic.

Disappointed.  The law in Arizona states very clearly, on one page the laws and rules governing service dogs...walking up to a person and asking them what their disability is is against the law.  The store manager Jessie, specifically did this to me today.  When I told him it is illegal to ask he flubbed around for a while then picked this jewel out of his cranium....I hear the law changed or was amended.  Bull crap.  He knows what the law is......you cannot be a manager in the food industry in Arizona and claim to be be ignorant of the law.  Am I accusing him of lying....no...I will not go that far...bullying, yes...I will go exactly that far.  Taking advantage of people that may not know the law....yes. Yes.  Yes.   I may make a formal complaint. I will be calling regional and reporting this behavior for sure.

What a beautiful patio....quiet, clean on a huge park- great service- yummy food- very well priced considering the million dollar atmosphere- Modern- they allow well behaved dogs on the patio- so close to cute shops. the civic center mall can be tricky to find- just watch for the signage- 'civic center parking lot' we went for a very late lazy lunch- it is not a chain with stupid cold microwaved food- it is a real restaurant where chefs think about creative light fare. The menu is very lite so do not go if you want a rack of lamb. we all had the BLT- the fry were hot - the sandwich was nice and warm- the bacon was perfectly crisped- the price- very reasonable

Hot! stupid, slow.  Lame. Poor management. Hot. Hot. Hot. This is Arizona. Get a fan. The misters were turned off at sunset. The temp was 100 plus degrees. There is a happy medium., Fans!  They were invented a billion years ago.  We sweat like pigs In a slaughterhouse.  This is a typical Sam Fox restaurant. How do you miss the obvious? The extremely obvious.  The insanely in your face obvious.  Designed by idiots.  It is equivalent of no heat in Chicago. Does anyone have a brain with this dumb chain?

I had lunch on Friday, July 8 2011. They changed the menu. Horrors of horrors.  The salad that was perfect , farmers , was a soggy mess with too much dressing.  The bread, which was perfect,is now a tasteless brown bread. They are re branding to health food, why? Why not french style. Perfect fresh food cooked well? The salad was filled with tiny grains of quoina, if you like to have a million tiny grains stuck in your teeth this is the salad for you. Also, raw green beans.....WTF? The manager was nice but fox is on a downslide. Probably getting ready to go public. Too bad another chain with mediocre food.

I wrote a negative review a few months ago but thought I would give it a second try.  The restaurant is much better. The service was wonderful. The outside tables were replaced and no longer have slats, that trapped spilled food  The server came over and wrote down my order, we were simple today but it was appreciated. I loved my Tuna appetizer ...healthy fresh and tasty. My husband and daughter were equally impressed....I will be back often. I really felt the last yelp that was negative was listened to and today was very professional and a fun time.

If you like your food frozen then microwaved you will love this place. I was shocked by the food. So bland. What TF?  The Caesar salad was wilted and bland. The chicken parmesaen was pre made -frozen, square cutlet topped in horrible marinara sauce. We also split the linguini in white clam sauce. Again bland as can possibly be made , no flavor at all.....(unless you are feeding ulcer patients.) I cannot recommend this place at all

I read the other reviews and I have to ask- what is not to love, the same clothes are at the mall for 10x the money- anyone with teenage girls has to try it- most girls want to wear something once or twice, throw it on the floor and never wash it.....you have to be crazy to spend $80 on a shirt that will be abused that way. Last time I was there I was in shock- it was great, I took three teenagers, they each left with a huge bag- for about $80 each. I found the store organized- I did not have trouble finding cute stuff. after I got bored with shopping ( they didn't) there were plenty of seats to take a break. The girls that worked there were super wonderful.

I had a perfect experience- I cannot imagine anyone not being happy here- they are wonderful- from the front office to every Doctor I have seen. The surgery center was great - Ellen at the surgery center stayed by my side and was kind - efficient and professional- I would recommend this practice to anyone.......  Thank you, Dr. Tozer for being such a wonderful surgeon.

The service was very slow. People at several tables were waiting, far to long for, drinks checks food. The table had no bread plate , no salt and pepper. No napkins.  We had to ask for everything. The busser did not seem to understand how to set a table. We ordered the beet salad, it had no flavor and huge -hard as a rock  beets, no cheese. Tiny orange wedges.  No good.  I ordered, for a main dish the Covina, white fish. It was so salty I had to send it back. The waitress then informed me that I ordered it wrong! Last time I checked you made sure your food tasted good and wasn't toxic with salt. She informed me that it was served blackened, blackened does not mean coated in disgusting salt. My hubby ordered capellini. The shrimp were undercooked and not fresh. There was very little tomato sauce. It was bland greasy and void of any redeeming qualities. Again , like the beet salad, the veggies were not prepared correctly ...... huge lumps of tomatoes, , mix yourself?  How do you serve pasta with no sauce ? Overall I would say the chef is not talented. No one bothers to prep properly, no one is tasting the plates as they are so bad it is impossible to believe the menu is being checked and corrected. In the meantime to go back for a glass of wine and an appetizer may happen as there is some potential , just a glimmer ....and , in a few months, if enough people review, and finally .....if the owner is smart enough to stop this unfortunate cascade . The patio is pleasant, I hope someone cares enough.

Can a restaurant get worse and worse every year and still remain open?  I guess so....kings is terrible and huge and gorgeous......I only went there to meet a client halfway.  In the failed Tempe marketplace, where even the Levi store cannot make it sits Kings....an overpriced horrible restaurant that was empty for lunch last Saturday. I would have had better food at jack in the box.  My tacos, which I did complain about, were disgusting....they even messed up the cilantro...which takes effort. You are supposed to use the leaves only...not the stems, the stems are inedible.  I was pulling them out from each bite. Very gracefulI , I was told they were purposely placed there to make a rustic taco....so I guess I can serve a pile of crap and call it rustic? No salsa and stale chips were the perfect accompaniment.... My husband ordered a shrimp salad. The lettuce was old and brown. No one could be bothered to toss it, it had the look of a thrown in handful of each stale ingredient with a tiny amount of shrimp. You could almost see the plastic gloves and the bored underpaid kitchen staff...( wanna bet? ) stay away unless you like bread for dinner. By some miracle the bread is still edible. Please do not believe any good reviews you see here...it is simply impossible that this restaurant transforms into anything but what I saw...a lowly corporate effort........very overpriced.....I would be shocked if they make it year.

This place is fantastic.  The owner chef has a gift. I am so spoiled.  We eat mostly lamb and chicken curries, spicy, they have never sent out a dish that wasn't pipping hot and perfectly spiced. The owners are very nice people as is their staff.  The only possible negative thing to say is the lunch buffet  can get picked over and be very slow to replenish.  I imagine if I got there early it would be better, so....if you like buffets get there super early.  Like 11:00.

Recently 'redecorated'. All beauty and charm has been surgically removed. The banquets, thick green comfortable replaced with wooden slate chairs and rickety tables to match. The tasteful gating removed. Replaced with what appears to be giant tire rims with tiny fruit trees.  I am totally over all fox restaurants. They can't even be trusted to redecorate without wrecking the place. Bloom is fugly as can be.  The managers are good at apologizing, which is good- they will doing plenty of it.  Their new menu ideas are equally bad, I can see their getting ready to go public, buyer beware this chain is over.

We ordered chicken parmesan. It was terrible. The dish was bland and flat. The noodles on the side were mush.  We started with a beet salad, split. They were about three bites each. The coffee came out half empty. When they made more it it was weak and watery.  The tomato butter they serve with the bread is terrible but I guess that's okay as the bread is stale.  The restaurant was crowded. It was 81 degree that day. They have an open kitchen with huge fires burning like mad and didn't turn on the Air. It must have been 85 degrees inside. The outside is a disaster, no decor. I can only go there when the amnesia sets in. They also try to take you to 'the annex' a crap shell across the way from the garbage cans and the bathrooms. Your food gets to be carried with no tray right by the custodians emptying the trash cans....And the maintenance workers with their filthy mops. When you make a reservation they don't tell you they are going to stick you in the annex,Their failed coffee shop with no atmosphere.

I would give zero stars but I am not sure it would post. If you like freezing cold food with warm ice tea , you have found it! Horrible service, we were greeted with a bowl of broken store bought chips and weak salsa, that was the high point! The waiter forgot to enter our order, when the food finally came it was ice cold. The manager picked up the tab, I prefer to have a good meal and pay. This Was torture. The staff is clueless. Sam fox has jumped the shark.

The pharmacy is just terrible. You are ignored and abused. I just spoke to the manager.  She asked to phone if I had a good experience as she was going to speak to her manager. I told her that in three years I have not had a good experience. They Are harried, abrupt and semi rude. No eye contact no thank  you for coming. You are abused and demeaned ineveryway. Terrible , terrible terrible!  Walgreens is much better. They may be over worked but they are polite.   If you want to give them you business go ahead, they have not earned it    I will never go to that pharmacy again.  Susan Wenger

Excellent doctors office - I cannot go anywhere else- they are that professional and nice The office is gorgeous-  they run a tight ship- they do not take samples from sales people so are not beholding to push a particular drug-  I see Dr Sudekum- so do most of my friends and family- she is a wonderful physician- we are all very pleased.

Fantastic- I almost didnt write a review becaseu this place is already too popular. I was in the other night with my Mom who is 81. The owner came over and made her feel special - he is wonderful- super talented, great personality- The food is delicious, better than pizza bianco in my opinion. I would love to see this restuarant expand ( old Gardunos?) .  I could eat here everyday- no it is not fattening at all, thin bubbly and delicous

So we went again, we love the patio. This time for drinks and appetizers.  The service was horrible. The drinks good. The hummus a little weird in flavor. Not really Persian and creamy. Lumpy and brownish with too little bread. The pizza was horrible, tiny no flavor, digiorno is better. The lettuce cups were so so, the restaurant seems committed to using something sweet and stcky in everything. I don't know the name of the spice but it smells like potpourri and tastes like room freshner

I have been here about 4 times- I have been offered frosty drinks each time with no cocktail napkin, the drinks drip and slide- it is a weird problem but WTF?   The food is prettty bad- the owner was a F/B guy at a big hotel chain so either he has no taste buds of doesnt care enough to eat his own food- I have had better food from Lean Cuisine. Everyhting is cold hard and stale- really poor food- If there is the least bit of a rush you wait forever for a freezing cold pizza- overall a pretty bad place- Without this location it would have closed first year.

Extremely over rated restaurant the food is very bland. You can open any bag of lettuce and dress it poorly to get the same result. The service was terrible. The waitresses are rude and once they take your order you will never see them again   When I asked what was recommended the waitress was completely put out. When i asked for a four top in the main dining room the miserable idiot they hired for a hostess could not have been less gracious., she wanted to put us in the back shitty add on when the main dining room was 1/2 full  Their style is pure 70's shabby chic gone stale. The food cannot amaze anyone unless you have been living on hospital food. Do not waste your time and money. This place has jumped the shark.

We tried this restaurant again last night I must say the food was tasty but again it was not really hot just warm our server appeared to be the only one on the floor , when I asked him what was going on he said they're pulled off the servers to go to a new restaurant also owned by the chain a few doors down in the same complex,so they were very very understaffed. The first time I came here they had a full restaurant but there was no food on any of the tables ....last night no servers ...I did hear that they have run out of entrées and appetizers regularly which I think is crazy. Just shows poor management  This is a mediocre to good chain restaurant, to expect more is silly. The eggplant pram was tasty. The portion big but even though I stressed hot it was just barely warm, no steam when I cut into it    There is no excuse to be short staffed. The manager just stood at the door gossiping all night. This is the second time I have seen her, she could be helping out. Expect a family style chain type of service with some better things on the menu, lukewarm. No one is leaving here with an Italian restaurant epiphany. Nor are they running to bring friends over. Mostly seniors, like me, wanting a good italian meal but settling due to location, which is the only excellent thing about this restaurant.

We stopped by last night.  The service was great...which is remarkable as their was no service last time we ate here. The food a very bland but pretty good.  I am updating my review because again I noticed they are still very poorly staffed.  There wasn't one server on the floor when we got there. No hostess at the stand.  If the food had more spice and if the restaurant was staffed properly I would go more.  The salad caprese is an example of poor flavoring.  Too light on basil. Too light on oil and vinegar. It was a generous portion but so bland ...and no server around to get more oil and vinegar. We shouldn't have to ask for more basil, oil and vinegar. The salad should be dressed correctly. My muscle dish had four mussels that didn't open. You are not supposed to serve unopened clams or mussels. They should be discarded.

We were a starving party of five. We were seated on the pub side of the room. There was one server he was also the bartender. We waited for drinks. We waited for water and then I left...too hungry to put up with terrible service   ...This is shit so far, I cannot make it through an entire meal. We asked for the check and left.  I asked for the manger. I told him, only One person,/bartender server...... Terrible service. A joke. We're never returning  Another crap corporate shit pub.  The manager sucks.

We tried this for the first time tonight. March 16. Two weeks after opening.  Party of four. Very uninspired to say the least. Cold food. Poorly spiced. Good service , i felt bad for the servers, they seem to know the food is crap...bland cold ...yuck.   The water was served with no ice   The calamari was as boring as fish sticks The pasta dish was cold and hard. There was no flavor to anything ....Boring chain. Don't bother.  I am holding back here. I could say much more. It's just a sad chain.  Pathetic.

I just scrolled through the reviews and I am shocked. Someone really likes this place? It was a huge disappointment. The food was below adverage. In and out is much better. The price is fine the fries never showed up so I can't say.  Two stars at the absolute most. I may , if desperate, try a chicken sandwich. It was a greasy disgusting hamburger, I did not take the leftovers for my dog.  The ambiance is car wash. The help are looking suicidal.

Excellent affordable. Clean friendly. Great fish. Yummy miso and a hot menu if you prefer noodles or tempura. All at wonderful prices, not much ambiance. If they added a little style they would be packed to the rafters. I think the last houR of lunch....2-3 pm should be 1/2 off all revolving sushi. It does go bad you know.   I love the staff, always cherry happy friendly runs around like lunatics to get you want you want.  They must be very happy at work, it shows.

I did a cost analysis of the avocado roll sandwich - I had a hard time finding any chicken so I came in at about .35 cents, this can be yours for a mere 11.00 plus don't forget the tip!!!!. Taco bell has higher food costs.   In a move of total hypocrisy they use plastic throw away glasses- when I arrived they were carrying huge black sacks of waste to the dumpster, really?  I also looked in to their claim of "Food Raised- 'Without Additives'....Here is what I found.......  There is no USDA definition to the term " No Additives" anyone using the term may or may NOT be referring to this legal regulation.......No third party regulation.  I'm still upset about my $87.00 lunch that I left hungry and bloated - they use a ton of salt- I'm happy to pay for a good meal - this place is a total sham- the kitchen is NOT Gluten Free, the servers want a tip but all they do is bring the food to the table. No water....then bring the check- why can't FOX pay their employees?- it is an insult to the guests, get it yourself and don't forget to pay my employees wages...... I cannot believe the good reviews I am seeing here- it must be' herd mentality'- the food is not gluten free-not low in salt - not  generous portion, NOT tasty - good for you is questionable as there are more nutrients in romaine than Kale so that s a pile of crap. If you feel like sitting outside and looking at people go for a coffee....wait- they don't sell coffee!!!!

Getting better.  New manager. They have a problem being fully stocked.  If you don't replenish displays why take up the selling space? The Palladio and the kardashian displays have been empty for years.  Why no hourglass or nars? I hope this store doesn't go the way of bath and beyond. Which is products that they have an ownership interest in - and then ultimately cheap and terrible.  Bath and beyond is a poor company to emulate.....please stay fresh....the store. Does Look pretty bad.  The color scheme is uninspiring , the displays fall apart if you touch them...... Picking Lamcolbn to be your high end anchor is a weird choice, there are 'hipper' lines to go with. Lamcobn seems old and tired.   Can't spell it!

Had the greatest experience. I needed wood flooring in 2 large rooms, I needed to match a discontinued floor sample.  Howard not only found it for me but at a great price. Miro, his installer was wonderful as well. His team worked quietly and efficiently, they left the house nice and clean.  Not only are the reviews positive here on Yelp but the BBB gives this business an A+. Very hard to get.  Thank you for everything.......

Came in for the second time. Clothes are pretty awful but I needed candles and with the recession I have to search high and low. The clerks are very rude , no eye contact, hello, goodbye or thank you. Loud personal conversations are going on in every department. I should work here. It is basically clock in then stand around and talk for 8 hours. The store is dark the mercy is very bad. The whole place smells like cheap glue. Poor lighting. You really feel like your at the salvation army

We were there last night. It was excellent. Very casual. Huge patio. Wonderful servers.  For 90.00 we had 8 drinks, seven huge appetizers and 2 huge sushi rolls.  A ton of food, all great. I highly recommend happy hour. It's over at 7 pm. All the appetizers are 5.00 and many of the excellent cocktails are too.  The service is very good.  I have one odd small complaint.  It had rained earlier.   The servers had to wipe down the whole patio.....the issue.? They left a dirty red bucket sitting out by the doorway with a rag hanging off the corner.

I just read all the reviews and now feel hopeless.....Haggens marketing is terrible. The grand opening never happened. Just awful. I guess they will continue to shut down stores.  Which reminds me....do they have stock I can short?   The marketing people deserve an award for their ability to live with 2 brain cells (One for breathing, the other for standing up). They did nothing when they reopened to welcome the community.  Nothin.....think on that.....I'm opening a giant new store and my strategy is do nothing.   I tried to remain upbeat as their meat and fish are excellent but the store is empty so it's time to give up. When I complained to one of the big shots  from corp. Haggen visiting  that the store should have a grand opening ....balloons ....and music and a few big sales he said, 'everyone is out of town'.....I assume he hasn't been to frys.....the store is packed with customers, 10 lanes of checkers....all busy day and night.  Frys probably brings in 100,000 a day in revenue So....clueless....yes.....hired nice new cashiers but all the lanes are closed?...yes......prices? high on fresh produce and, yes....much of it is spoiled. A great recipe for failure. Another reviewer said the store was a little dirty and some of the new hires are unprofessional.....I like the new hires.....store, I must agree, could look better.  Fire the bozos at the top....then free the worthless marketing people from their chains ....they can back to staring at the walls of their homes where they will feel safe and not have to make stupid non decisions   They know zip zero about marketing.....all this is a waste ....so sad

Flower child Has great salads... I don't think this is someplace to go if you are big on meat....huge portions....or..heaven forbid, fried food.  I am not a nutritionist but I know enough to say this is clean food, good recipes and insanely well run restaurant.    The portions can be smallish....the price is not for everyone, $28.00 for 2 salads?  I do feel a little bad for the employees...why is there a place for a tip on the receipt? You stand in line to order. The table are like a decent food court. You get your own drinks....who am I tipping?  I should tip myself...  On a warm sunny day when you don't want to get stuck forever getting a fattening lunch Flower Child delivers
