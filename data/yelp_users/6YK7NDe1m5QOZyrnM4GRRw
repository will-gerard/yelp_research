I walked in for the first time and had to get the cashiers attention because she was texting on her phone.   My order: veggie low mein, cream cheese wontons, white rice. (Vegetarian)  Received: veggie low mein, crab puffs, and pork fried rice.   I asked the cook for what I originally asked for, and he said he did what the ticket said, then proceeded to show me it. I said, if I could eat this I would but I'm a vegetarian. He brought me over a bowl of steamed rice and after separating the pork out of my vegetable low mein, it tasted good.  We left within 5 minutes if receiving my food because the cashier was screaming in Chinese on the phone at someone. Bad idea to go there.

Some pros are the amazing staff that make every experience personable, great kids club that listens and respects my parenting style, great group training classes that push you to the max (Julio's classes are my favorite), they are always cleaning & the gym is very well kept up. I go during the daytime & I never run into any issues with the gym being to crowded. Every month I notice more and more equipment being brought in. My daughter asks me every day  to take her to the gym because of how much she enjoys it, especially the staff. Love this place & the people that run it!
