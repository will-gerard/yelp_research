I had a lovely dinner here.  I had two friendly and attentive servers.  Make a reservation in advance and mind the dress code.  I had the from the garden, buffalo tenderloin and the essence of chocolate dessert.  The desert was my least favorite it was ok.  Everything else was great.  I enjoyed the bread and the amuse bouche (seared elk loin) and the sorbet intermezzo.  I had a couple vermouths and the bill with tip came to $130.  the steak and salad were both excellent.  The bill came with truffles and upon paying valet had already retrieved my vehicle and there were more chocolates, bottle of water, and a thank you note inside.

I have stayed here for 3 business trips, 2 of which were recent.   Pros: good breakfast.  It now includes an omelet station and i enjiy the watermelon, canteloupe and honeydew.  It is much better than a continental breakfast or standard holiday inn.  It also has bacon, sausage, eggs, potatoes, pancakes, waffles and others.  The lobby is nice, bar has outdoor and indoor seating, courtyard has a firepit, and rooms have been nicely renovated.  I request a quiet room not facing the parking lot.  There are many tv channels, Internet works, and there are many bars and restaurants within walking distance (vintage 95 and santan brewery for example).  Staff was friendly.  Cons:  the rooms are accesible via outside only and the property looks kinda old, but is maintained and again rooms were updated.  I have never been given an upgrade here for having platinum status.  I have not used the pool, gym or golf course here and when traveling, i prefer to eat outside.

Great burger.  Slow service late night.  Was crowded.  I ate here around 8 or 9 years ago and it's still good now.  The burger is cooked perfectly.

The chocolate at jean philippe is amazing.  This location has different boxes than at bellagio.  The ones here are blue.  When I was there they had some unique chocolate sculptures on display.  Near this hotel are a couple of art galleries worth checking out - sculptures and glass.

I have eaten here in vegas a few times.  This time the food was not good and service was slow (it was crowded with a line to get in).  I had corned beef and hard salami on rye.   Bread was not so great, salami was brown and tasted old, past its prime.  Corned beef was cold.  I should have sent it back, but again service was bad so i never got the chance.  We had to pay with cash so we could get out.  I'll stick to buying my hard salami in NY at Katz's.

I stopped in for dinner while on business travel.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  I went with the fish sampler which i enjoyed and green beans.  With tip it came to around $55.  i prefered the mahi mahi of the three.   PS.  The happy hour has a burger that sounds good.

I had wanted to stop by after reading the reviews and finding out it is 2 minutes away from the hotel i am staying out.  The place is not fancy, but it looks clean and has a nice salsa/condiment bar.  The employees were super friendly and patient with me.  I had the torta ahogada and said yes to very spicy.  I sat down and she surprised me by bringing me some sauce to try and it was quite spicy but fine for me.  Then a lady dropped off a free fried taco like dish which was good and then brought my torta a few minutes later.  And then she came back and brought me some limes and pickled onions.  Anyway, the sandwich was good and i had fun.  Next time i'd try a regular torta.  And the tacos there are very good.

I have eaten here 3x and never have been dissapointed.  It's a nice looking restaurant with a good variety on the menu.  I like that you can substitute sides with no charge.  I have had a hamburger here twice (top notch).  This time i had the parmesan crusted mahi and it was amazing.  The fish was cooked perfectly and a nice portion.  The butter sauce was the perfect complement.  I had the veggies as a side which were fine, but dull.

Simply good pizza.  Doesn't need any toppings, but i added meatballs.  Nice looking restaurant also.  I stop by when ever i am in AZ.  In NY, i go to lombardis, but Grimaldi's is also good there.  THe cannoli in AZ is also good.  Crispy, not soggy and the filling was good.

I walked to santan from my nearbye hotel. The place was packed on thursday night.  There were only 2 empty seats at the bar.  I tasted a couple beers and went with the moonjuice ipa.  It was good and had 7+% alcohol. It was around $4.75 which is very reasonable.   I ordered the green chili stuffed burger medium rare.  It was cooked perfectly and tasted great. Had a little kick to it.  The bun was good, but a better bun would have made it just about perfect.  They give u a choice of sides which was nice and for $12 was a great value.  Staff was friendly, good beer, good food.  I will definitely stop by next time i am in town.

5 star view, good decor.  Good, pricey drinks, not too excessive though considering the venue.  We had bolognese fries which were not good.  I should have sent them back, but i eat what's in front of me if it's edible.  Service was a bit slow.  It took a while to place our order, but once we did they came out in a reasonable amount of time.

Nothing special.  Had the Sicilian crust.  Not the type of pizza i want to eat again.  The place was crowded, lots of families.  I would go to Grimaldi's next time.

Shrimp were yummy.  Fun place for large groups.  My girlfriend enjoyed the crawfish and clams.  She thought the shrimp were the best.

Great pastries.  The owner and chef is very nice.  He threw in a few freebies and showed us his restaurant in the same shopping center.  The french macaroons were very good (I usually don't like these at other places).  The cookies and donuts are very good.  My girlfriend enjoyed the waffle sandwich on the breakfast menu.  It's big enough for 2 or 3 people to share.

Nice place in downtown chandler.  I walked here from the hotel i was staying at.  The hotel recommended it and the reviews/photos looked good.  I had a good porter beer, terrific burger with grilled veggies instead of fries, and how could i pass on the smores cake?  I am giving this place  5 stars for the setting, good beer and service, but above all for the delicious burger.  The smores dessert was good, but nothing special.  It was like a dense brownie with a crust and marshmallow fluff topping.  It was good, but a bit too rich.  The burger was juicy and flavorful and came on a perfect bun.

This is one of the best burgers I have ever had.  The buns are baked fresh daily.  The meat is cooked perfectly.  It was a flawless burger.  The pork quesadilla was also quite good.

Great pizza and house salad.  Small house salad is big enough for 3 or 4 people to share.  We ate here twice in Vegas, both times at the Palazzo.

While staying at a nearby hotel, i took a stroll and came upon this place.  The studio is nicely decorated with finished glass, pottery and paintings for sale.  You can also make your own.  I bought a pendant and painting for my nieces.  They even shipped it for me.  The staff was very friendly.

I came upon this place while taking a stroll near my hotel.  Upon entering, you can quickly tell that this is a serious coffee spot.  The menu has a good selection including handpours, cortado and others.  They roast their own coffee in house too.  I can say that the cappuccino and cortado were both top notch.  I also grabbed a couple pounds of coffee to take home.  They support local businesses and you'll see some featured pastries.  Don't miss out.  I live in portland and can say this place is just as good.  Drink well my friends
