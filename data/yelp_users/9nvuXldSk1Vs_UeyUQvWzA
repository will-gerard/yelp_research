This is my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area. It's a great place for me and my husband since I'm vegetarian and he's a meat eater. They have a wide variety for both sides and I believe they always offer a couple vegan options as well.   My favorite is the Veggie Mexican (Quorn brand "ground beef", egg, jalapeno, potato & cheese) and he loves the Royale with Cheese which is pretty much a cheeseburger and fries wrapped up in a delicious crust! We each usually have half a pasty leftover for lunch the next day if I can keep myself from overstuffing myself because it's so good. You also definitely have to try the Banoffee Pie(graham cracker crust with banana, homemade caramel & whipped cream). My mouth is watering just thinking about it! They also have a pretty big selection of beers I've never heard of if that's your thing!   The space is pretty small but I feel it kind of adds to the ambiance. My only complaint is that it's so far away. We need one in North Phoenix!  GO EAT AT CORNISH PASTY NOW!!!! (and bring me your leftovers!)

I love the idea of Luci's and I've had some great experiences here. The staff is always friendly and the lattes are great. I haven't tried the food yet but that's definitely next on my list. Unfortunately they are pretty overpriced and their iced coffee is just not my cup of tea. This morning I paid almost $8 for a small iced coffee (which I wasn't a fan of) and a decent but a little dry muffin. I would give them 3.5 stars if that was an option.

My husband and I came here for a late lunch/early dinner today (Sunday). It's pretty small and kind of feels like you're at a friends house which is a nice change of pace.   Pros: The food was GREAT. I had a veggie quesadilla but it was more like a Mexican calzone- I had to eat it with a fork. Seriously so much flavor and it was big enough to eat half and save for later but I'm a bad ass and ate almost all of it because that's how I roll.  My husband (the picky one) had a carne Asada burrito- just steak, beans and cheese plus he added sour cream. Two bites in we were already making plans to come back.  There were plenty of vegetarian and vegan options so I'm excited to go back and try something different next time!  They have a huge salsa bar but half of the salsas were missing descriptions so it was kind of a guessing game.  The horchata was huge and came with fresh fruit, nuts and cinnamon on top. It was good but not as thick as expected (I'm just a white girl from Kansas so I'm not an expert).  Cons: Parking can be a pain- I tried to come on a Saturday night and eventually gave up because I was already in a bad mood.  The chips were nothing special and salt would not stay on! They were free though so not holding that against them.   From the one $, I expected the prices to be cheaper. I wasn't even sure if there would be waiter service. For a burrito, quesadilla, horchata and two negra models (on special) it came to $32 and change plus tip.   Overall, we were very satisfied and will definitely be back.

This is the only good coffee shop I've found in North Phoenix! Their soy vanilla lattes are amazing, also try their grilled cheese with tomato, green chiles & hot sauce. It's so declicious!

Easily best place in North Phoenix for coffee. I always get a soy vanilla iced latte and it's always perfect. Prices are pretty average for a coffee shop. Also, if you're hungry for lunch grab a grilled cheese with green chiles, onions & siracha. One of the baristas recommended it to me and it was so messy and delicious! Only problem I had was connecting to the wifi but easily could have been my kindle. Right across from PVCC so great for any college students needing to get work done. Highly recommend it to everybody!

Americas Taco Shop in general is where I go when I've got a craving for a good bean and cheese burrito. I don't even really care for refried beans (and these are without lard,yay!) But man, these are so amazing. The hot salsa is great and a cochata to wash it down is amazing! I'm not even a big fan of horchata but mix it with iced coffee and I'm sold. I was actually addicted to it for a few months a couple years ago! This location isn't quite as nice as the one on Camelback but who cares, it's a quick taco shop!

To be fair, I'm usually happy with my food and I do appreciate the many veggie options as well as their punch cards. However, this is a sandwich only restaurant and I consistently have to wait about 20 minutes for them to make ONE sandwich! I normally come in around 2 pm and it's not busy. I cannot wrap my mind around how it can take this long to make a sandwich (and every time). I've never gotten an apology for the wait so I imagine it's not uncommon. Today the toppings were very poorly distributed- I found 7 inches worth of hummus in about 1 inch. Prices are pretty comparable to Jimmy John's and the like.

I've been here twice, once for happy hour with my husband and loved their selection of drinks. Today I came for lunch with a 3 year old, I had the Roosevelt Row Bagel which was so simple and delicious with the homemade hummus and smashed avocado, just the right amount of sprouts, very thinly sliced onion and tomatoes? red peppers? It was delicious and came with a slice of watermelon and a pickle. The (very adventurous) 3 year old had the curried coconut lentil soup and while he was more interested in the free corn cookie we got for checking in on Yelp (also delicious) he actually seemed to like it quite a bit. I snagged a bite and it was pretty good! The coconut and the curry balanced eachother well, nothing was too overwhelming. The only downside was the lack of indoor seating. Luckily the patio was shady and had misters. I will definitely be back to try some more of the menu!
