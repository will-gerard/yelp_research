Why more [places like this don't exist in AZ, I'll never know.  If you're looking for that old Europe feel, this is an excellent choice.  Although this spot is awesome at any time of the year, I think when the weather turns cooler, this is like a trip to your fantasy of an Olde English Public House.  There is an upstairs restaurant and a downstairs cellar bar. I'll be focusing on the Cellar bar.  Downstairs is amazing. There are/were only a couple bars in PHX that I can think of that were underground and this is one of them. It's swanky, candle-lit, and it has some of the best happy hour specials I've ever experienced. Their "small plate's" are truly some of the finest creations I've ever had for the price.  I would recommend trying them all out eventually, but start with one or two. For $5 during happy hour, they can't be beat.  As for the drinks, there are two times where you can seriously get your money's worth.  On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday all bottles of wine are 1/2 price.  And they have some excellent wines. The other time is regular happy hour all week from 3-6.  For me, it's all about going on a Sun, Mon or Tues during HH! 1/2 of bottles of wine, cocktail specials AND $5 small plates. I'll call it budget-swank. Excellent experience for not too much money./Art

Yep, I really like this place! It's quite a quaint and small house, but they also have a pretty great patio in the front of the house with misters to keep you cool/alive in the PHX heat.  I have never experienced an anchovy pizza, and i finally had a chance to try a piece at Cibo.  Surprisingly, it was quite good! If you like salty things, you'll love the anchovy pizza.  One downside for me is that they have so few pizzas that offer meat as a topping.  I think there's only one on the menu! Other than that, though, the quality of the food is excellent and they have some very good wines to choose from. I recommend the Candoni Pinot Noir:) /Art

Well I've always heard this place was so insanely busy, so i just never went. If it really is usually as busy as I've heard, then I recommend coming on a Saturday before the dinner rush. I came at 4:30 and was seated immediately.  It was nice to see that they had established a full bar, since I understand it was previously beer and wine only. Cocktails are pricey at $8, but they made them pretty strong, so I'm not too upset.  The Pizza was stunningly good. I ordered the gladiator and my date ordered the mushroom pizza.  The gladiator was basically a meat lovers pizza and they loaded on the toppings.  The mushroom pizza tasted so fresh, i don't think I've ever tasted mushrooms so good!  this may be the best pizza I've tasted in town, but I think I'll have to give it one more try to confirm my original thoughts.  Definite recommendation./Art

Not sure how to handle this one. I really like this bar. If it were ever open. This place has good food, great beers and a really fun atmosphere.  However, it closes at 2pm during the week! I've heard of bars not opening until the afternoon/evening, but closing at 2pm and not opening back up for happy hour or dinner? That seems odd. It does seem to still be open on the weekend, so i'll try it again since I love their patio, but i just cant rate a bar that closes after lunch very highly./Art

This place just plain rocks.  I grew up on Uncle Sam's in North Phoenix, and after moving downtown, I struggled to find a good, giant, hero.  I'm sure some yelpers could lead me in the right direction, but up until now I haven't been able to find a giant sandwich DTown.  Well, I've found it. The Hero Factory is a place for huge sandwiches. And firearms. Yes, the proprietor is a hot chick with a sidearm. The service is awesome. We came in close to closing (fyi, they aren't open weekends, and close at 3 on weekdays) and asked if they had tables outside.  The proprietor told me she would put one out for us.  This place was ready to shut down, but she offered to take a table outside so we could enjoy the weather.  Big menu, awesome service, HUGE SANDWICHES, very reasonable prices and great food.  If you get a chance, try this place./Art

Local breeze is definitely a DTown PHX gem.  Situated just behind Cibo on Fillmore and 5th ave, it gives you another great option to grab a bite or a cocktail.  Although the food probably deserves its own review because it's so good, I want to focus on the awesome ambiance.    This place feels like you are on the beach! It's amazing.  The second you walk in, you forget that you're in the middle of DTown PHX.  It's only when a city bus rumbles by outside that you ever even think about being in the city.  I assume this feeling of beach nirvana is caused by the foliage-lined walls that block out the outside world, completely immersing you in Local Breezyness.   Other than the walls though, the general layout is also great.  They actually do have a nice big indoor part of the restaurant, but I rarely see many people inside.  Not because it's not nice, but because the huge outdoor patio/bar/yard is where you'll want to hang.   They have great management/staff, awesome drink specials and excellent food.  If you have an open weekend afternoon, I can't recommend enough spending it outside at local breeze
