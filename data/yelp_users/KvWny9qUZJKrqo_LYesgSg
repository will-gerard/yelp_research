I love this place! Wish my work was still close to it because I'd eat there at least once a week for lunch.  Their lunch specials are so inexpensive!  We're talking $5-$6 a plate which includes the entree, rice and a cup of soup.  Can't get better than that.  Their service during lunch is amazingly fast.  That way if you only have an hour for lunch, you're in and out with time to spare.   My most recent review is when 14 of my friends and I went to China Chili for dinner.  We actually planned on going to Gallo Blanco but it was almost a 2 hour wait to accommodate our party.  So off to China Chili we went and there was no wait to boot!  We ordered the peking duck, mongolian beef, house chow mein, fried rice, walnut shrimp, peking pork chops, crispy noodles, ma po tofu...and really, that's all I can remember.  Some of the guys also had beers and sake.  I can't think of one dish that I did not like.  This place does NOT disappoint.  After stuffing our faces, we were delighted that our bill, plus tax and gratuity ended up being $10 a person.  What a deal!!!  I am a huge fan of China Chili!

Love CherryBlossom.  I've tried their ramen and udon dishes and have never been disappointed.  I really want to try their Italian dishes but have always been hesitant since they are considered a Japanese restaurant, but after seeing some of the pictures on here, they definitely look worth trying.  Their daily special bento boxes are always great, too, and are inexpensive.  It's definitely a smaller restaurant but they do take reservations.  Service is pretty consistent in that it is good - except for this one caucasian guy that we've had twice that never seemed into his job, never had recommendations, never refilled our drinks unless we asked and was pretty slow, but other than that, the other female servers we had were always friendly and knowledgeable.  I wish this place was closer to my house, as I would frequent it much more often.

I purchased a David Yurman ring from a really friendly sales person by the name of Eiko last week. She was extremely professional and answered all of my questions.  The jewelry store was pretty empty and I actually was just passing through to get to the shoe department but stopped to window shop.  When I was asking which ring would look better on me, Eiko called her colleague over, Layla, to ask her opinion also.  They were quite friendly and if they are on commission, you would never know it.  I'm happy with my purchase and would definitely go back there again for my David Yurman goods.

This place has the most amazing kitchen gadgets. Things I would NEVER even fathom having in my kitchen. It's so fun!  I wish I had the money to buy everything!  I usually do come in here to buy their silicon with wooden handle spoon and spatula though.  They are sturdy and I can use them on just about anything.    They do have free cooking classes on Sunday's at this location.  They recommend that you call and RSVP though in case it's a popular course and they don't have enough food to go around.    They are all really friendly there and very helpful with any questions that you may have.

Ohh this place was delicious.  I ordered the Hawaiin ribeye and it melted in my mouth and the flavor just exploded!  I loved it!  The baked potato was piled high and I could probably eat that steak over and over again.  Their california roll was very tasty - assuming it must have been real crab - with a "c"!  We also ordered the salmon and mango roll which wasn't all that great, but definitely edible.  The wait for a Friday night around 8 pm was about 15-20 minutes which was not bad at all.  Service was impeccable.  Very attentive and different people catering to our needs which was nice.  Drinks were always refilled in a timely manner and they checked on us just enough to make it not seem obnoxious.  I will definitely come back here again and try other menu items.

I've come here a few times, mostly for lunch and I love it every time.  They serve the softest, warmest buttered croissants at the beginning - and don't be shy to ask for more! They are very nice about it.  And they are free!  They have a daily lunch special board - it used to be $10 but when we went yesterday, the price has gone up to $13.  The entree's look small, but they actually filled me up.  I had the beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes.  It was good but got heavy towards the end, so I traded with my brother, he ordered the pesto pasta ($7) with and added chicken (+$2).  The pesto pasta was very light but almost a little too bland.  At the end, you also get a complimentary dessert.  Our dessert yesterday was a flourless chocolate brownie with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top.  It was so good!  That definitely made me super full.  I would come back again for lunch.  The place is small and quaint and the price may seem pricey for lunch, but the quality surpasses the price.

I have ordered from here on several different occasions and had the pleasure of eating at the actual restaurant once.  I usually order the #1 Madame:  ham, salami, egg, tomato, mozzarella & lettuce with extra garlic sauce on the side.  I always order the small which is 6" and $5.99.  The sandwich is actually quite large and makes me really full.  It is soooo good and tasty. I think the garlic sauce is what makes it a home run for me.    I've also ordered the Bulgoki Bowl $7.99.  It's not like complete authentic bulgoki meat like you would get in a ma/pa restaurant, but it does the job considering there aren't any Korean restaurants in the area.    Today I ordered the Albacore Tuna Salad Wrap $6.79.  And once again, I was extremely satisfied with the wrap.  The tuna was juicy and not dry and it was mixed with the garlic sauce which was fantastic.    Delivery has always been quick and the driver friendly. I definitely will continue to order from them during my lunches.

I love Baskin Robbins because, well, heck, it has over 31 flavors!  I don't like to veer off from my "boring" Vanilla (as the hubs calls it), but I can't go to BR without getting their cookies and cream on a sugar cone.  There are so many other flavors there that are also quite tasty but I feel like I'm betraying cookies and cream if I try something else.

I've been here a few times for weekend retreats and to visit friends who were on retreats.  The place is great - secluded amongst Camelback Mountain.  The only downer for me is that I'm a local, so when I go on retreats, I like to travel far so I truly feel away from it all.  It also is no fun when it's so hot so you don't want to go outside. But for people who are coming from out of town, this is definitely a great retreat site.

I have only gone to Postino during the Monday/Tuesday $20 nights where you get a bottle of wine and choice of 3 bruschettas for the cheap price of $20.  I always order a bottle of moscato d'asti and a trio of Brie & Apples with fig, Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and Fresh Mozzarella with tomato and basil.  I usually go with a few of my girlfriends and this makes a great meal with fantastic wine and some good gossip. :)  Come early as seats fill up extremely quickly and the wait can get very long.  This deal starts after 8pm.

My husband I moved into this area a little over a year ago.  Though there are plenty of restaurants (both fast food and sit down) in this neighborhood, we were hoping to find a good Chinese restaurant.  It took us almost an entire year to finally try out Flamingo Palace.  The first time we went was probably 2 months ago - since then, we've been back at least 6 times.   The flamingo chicken (their speciality) is out of this world.  The crispiness of the chicken and the sauce that is used blend so well together.  I can't go to the restaurant without ordering this dish.  We've also tried their chow fun, seafood soup, sizzling rice soup, mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, house fried rice, crab puffs, wonton soup, and I can't think of the others - we haven't left disappointed with one dish just yet.    Though this Chinese restaurant charges more than your most ma/pa restaurants, it's still a pretty good deal considering how good the food is.  Service is not bad at all.  They all are Chinese therefore have a very thick accent, but it's still understandable.  They are prompt and check on you often.  I am definitely a fan of this place!

I really love Safeway.  Their prices are sometimes more expensive than other grocery stores, but I can always depend on Safeway stores being clean, bright and have friendly service.  The employees there are always so nice and helpful.  They seem like they enjoy working there.  I also love their Just4U app that gives extra discounts and even freebies!  It's a good way for me to try new things that I normally wouldn't.

This place is great. It is family owned. The owner and his kids run this shop.  They are honest and don't try to upsell a bunch of things to be done with your car.  When there is something going on, they'll take the time to explain it to you and tell you why you should consider having something done.  I go here for my oil changes, they are quick and professional.  Support local businesses!

Can you really go wrong with a bean burrito? I love them here.  They are cheap which makes it even better.  Their hard taco supreme and enchritos are also the bomb.  Obviously I cannot eat here everyday or I'd be the size of a blimp - so this place is for when I am feeling super lazy and do not want to cook - or as a late night, I've been out too long kind of meal.

You truly can never go wrong with Church's Fried Chicken.  Is it healthy? Nope, but man, is it good.  Their flavor for the chicken is just so consistent every time and so tasty.  Their mashed potatoes are also great along with the fried okra.  The corn has always been bad every time we buy it...it always looks so good, but every time, it's bland and soggy.  There is a girl that works there that is quite obnoxious.  She's loud, talks to herself, and talks randomly to people with the strangest remarks.  Though she's happy...you can clearly tell her co-workers can't stand her.  Poor girl.  Anyway, for the few times we get CFC, it beats out any other fried chicken place such as KFC or Popeye's.

The hubs comes to this library with our little man more than I do, but the few times I have tagged along with them, the place seems great.  There are always activities going on for the little tykes.  There's a quiet play area in the children's section where our son likes to build towers.  There's also a bunch of computers that he can go to to play some online games (nickjr, disneyjr, pbskids, etc.).  Whenever the hubs puts a book on hold, he gets an email to let him know that it's in.  The checkout system is self serve and pretty convenient.  The culture passes seem really cool, too, although we haven't taken advantage of that yet.

I love this place. Since we moved a few years ago we forgot about this place - but realized that the house we are currently in is only about 10 minutes away.  This place could be considered a hole in the wall, but the restaurant inside is actually pretty spacious with rooms divided.  We sat towards the back, which is fine since we have a toddler.  Their hot rolls come out with butter and the rolls are so delicious and fresh and hot!  One could get full off of them.    I ordered the seafood marinara pasta dish.  SO GOOD.  It's packed with big scallops, clams, shrimp and calamari mixed in with thin spaghetti and flavorful red sauce. And it's a huge portion, too!    The hubs ordered 20 wings, naked (dry) with a side of buffalo and honey bbq sauce.  Perfectly crunchy skin.    I have to remember that this place is not far from me - it's WAYYYYYYYYYYY better than an Olive Garden! :)

Came here for dinner because the hubs wanted to try out the AYCE shrimp.  I ordered the small filet (medium rare) with mashed potatoes, grilled shrimp and a side salad.  The filet was tough and took me a while to chew and chew ... and chew each bite.  The mashed potatoes were good, shrimp was salty and my side salad was decent.  The hubs got a filet with the AYCE shrimp - the shrimp were tiny. Probably bay shrimp.  And they gave very small portions.  He tried the scampi, buffalo and fried.  The scampi, if we were forced to choose were probably the tastiest out of the three.  We also ordered the cake pop trio for dessert and it was SO sweet we couldn't finish it.  The only good experience throughout the whole thing was that our server was very friendly.

This place was so disappointing.  Maybe they are known for their sushi, but since we were there for noodles, we didn't order sushi.  Unfortunately, their udon dish that they used to have in a broth was no longer on the menu.  Our server barely spoke english so we had a language barrier and she kept insisting we order their udon dish that was stir fried.  Instead I ordered their garlic chicken dish with rice.  The chicken was OLD and you could tell it had been flash fried quite a few times.  It was rough and wouldn't even tear apart when I was trying to cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  I couldn't even finish my dish.  The husband had these pork cutlets that he said was way too sweet and extremely dry.  He, too, had a hard time cutting his pork.  We ordered our son the udon stir fry and he ate about 4 bites and said he was "full".  So about $50 later, we left hungry and irritated and swearing we'd never come back here again.  So sad.

We love this place and always order the same thing.  House salad with ranch, wings (dry with honey hot sauce and ranch on the side) and a deluxe pan pizza.  By the time we get to the pan pizza, we are only able to manage 1 slice each and take the rest home.  The food is consistently good and the service is great.  Some nights they have karaoke night so it can get a bit loud.  But if it's bothersome, then take your food to-go.  Thankfully this place is just around the corner from our house.  We are definitely repeat customers.

How can a place go wrong with 32 flavors? It doesn't!  We usually come here when we're craving ice cream, but the most recent visit was for my son to claim his free birthday ice cream.  He chose the mint chocolate chip which he devoured in 5 minutes.  I ordered the cookies and cream which is always my favorite!  The service here was nice and they didn't mind at all when my son was being indecisive at first and wanted to try 3 other flavors before settling on his mint chocolate chip. We'd definitely come back.

I used to take my son to Cool Cuts for Kids for his haircuts but at $21+ a pop, it was getting a bit pricey...especially for a quick cut on a male toddler who already had short hair.  When he was younger and more fidgety, it was perfect because he could watch cartoons and sit in a cool car or airplane while he got his haircut, but at the age he is now, it's time to go somewhere else.    So we've come here for the last 4 haircuts and it's been great so far.  They also have a frequent customer card where discounts are applied, and on foursquare, if you check in 3 times, you get $2 off.  This location is fairly new so it's very clean and fresh feeling.  The service is decent.  They are pretty nice to my son.  Since he has super thick hair and grows quickly, he's been getting haircuts since he was 6 months old, so thankfully he's used to sitting still for them.  They are pretty detailed with his haircuts and take their time and the last 2 stylists have kids his age so they were able to relate to cartoons and superheros and they just jabbered away.

This is always a great place to take my son when it's time to cool down...he loves to play at the train table in the children's area.  Afterwards, he picks 2 books, we read them and go home.  I'm surprised this place stays in business considering people just read there and then leave - but until it does, we will keep coming to do the same.  This place was definitely better than Border's when it was still around.

This place never disappoints nor does it ever leave me hungry after I leave!  Portions are huge, service is friendly and they have a great rewards program which earns you Chompie's bucks to use towards your next meal.  Whenever I'm there I want to try everything but I can't say no to the Arizona Benedict (eggs benedict but with turkey, avocado and tomatoes).  Their potato cakes (latkes) are also delicious.  They also have a great dinner menu and I usually get their sliders although we don't really go there for dinner very often.    Don't forget to check in on Yelp and receive a free bagel of your choice when you purchase an item at the take out deli!

When you're with a bunch of people and are all hankering for different types of food, this is the place to go.  There are at least 20 pages worth of menu items ranging from Asian to American to Mexican to Italian.  The list goes on.  There's even a menu for the dieters called their Skinny Menu.  I am not a huge fan of corporate restaurants, but I'm not going to lie, this place never disappoints.  The items I usually order are:  Miso Salmon - delightful with salmon cooked to perfection laying over a bed of rice with this sweet and savory sauce drizzled on top.  I always ask for extra sauce on the side and they happily oblige.  I also order their chicken marsala with mushrooms - bow tie pasta with mushrooms, sliced chicken with a sweet and tasty marsala sauce.  I never can finish so I always have great leftovers the next day.    I always order their passion iced tea and their "brown" bread given at the beginning is always warm and soft.  Service there is almost always great - attentive servers and the food and drinks come out pretty quickly.    As for cheesecake, my favorite is their red velvet and their banana cream.  If I'm feeling really hungry still and have people willing to share, I love their strawberry shortcake.  It's too big to finish alone - you need at least 2 more friends to share it with.

We have visited this restaurant twice.  We have not been disappointed yet.  The pasta is made in-house and it's perfectly al-dente.  I recently had the lobster ravioli in a cream sauce.  It was so tasty and delicious. I asked for more bread at the end to sop up my leftover sauce.  The service there has always been wonderful.  Friendly, professional and informative.

Went here for reverse happy hour with some friends.  Never been a huge fan of Ra considering I feel there are other better sushi restaurants around, but the majority wanted to go here so I went.  Definitely good happy hour prices but still not all that great.  I ordered for the hubby and I:  the chicken wings, tootsie maki roll, Ra-ukin Shrimp and korean bbq short ribs.    I honestly don't have a lot to say about this place because there is nothing sticking out of my mind.  For all of that, my bill came to $33 including an 18% gratuity.

I mainly go to Red Robin when I have a my Freckled Lemonade craving.  Then I think about which burger I want - which almost always ends up with the Shroom Burger.  The mushrooms are grilled to perfection and it's always so tasty and juicy.  The unlimited fries are always a hit and I love steak fries.  My son had the kids pasta with butter and a side of apples.  He devoured the pasta and asked for more.  We were willing to pay for the pasta, but they said it was not a problem and they wouldn't charge us for it.  That was nice of them.  Service in general was great and we'd definitely come back again.

Came here for lunch because my lunch date wanted Mexican and it was by both our offices.  They had a $4.99 special of a chicken enchilada with a side of beans and rice.  What a smokin' deal, right?  Unfortunately, the enchilada was horrible.  It was tasteless, old and completely falling apart.  I picked at it and ended up with about 4 bites.  The chips and dip was the only bonus out of the entire meal.  I definitely got what I paid for. Never again.

We came here for Cosmic Bowling last weekend and had a great time.  It's $19.99/per person including shoes to play from 10pm - 1am.  Lights go out and black lights turn on.  Everything that can glow, will glow.  We were a party of 7 and had 2 lanes side-by-side.  The music was great - a bunch of oldies from my time.  I can't say my bowling score was the same. :(  Nonetheless it was fun.  The garlic fries were delish and so where the pretzel trios.  Reasonably priced and staff there were friendly and efficient.  I definitely would come back again...but then I was out wayyy past my bedtime. :)

First time here.   Cute old fashion place where the girls all dress up like they are from the 50's.  The ice cream was good - and reasonably priced.  I would definitely come back again, as they are also open late on weekends. I'd rather eat here than at Churn.

Love this place - it's a bit far from my house, but when I want a good rice or pho dish with out-of-this-world soy milk, I make the trek.  Don't be too afraid by the looks of this restaurant sitting in a raggedy strip mall.  The inside doesn't get much better either.  The place is mostly run by men - and on occasion I see a female at the register.  But these guys know their stuff and are quick.    I always order their com thit nuong trung chien - translates to their bbq pork with rice and a fried egg on top. It also comes with a side of nuoc mam (fish sauce) that I love to pour over my rice and leave a little in the bowl to dip my meat in.  I love the sauce that much.    I also order as an appetizer, their goi cuon - spring rolls.  Their rice paper is so darn chewy and perfect.  I don't know where they buy it from, but I have to find them!  But if you're ever there, please order the soy milk. It's made in-house and is sweet and delicious. I always order it in a large to-go cup as it's bigger than their regular glasses.

It's a church - what could I possibly say that is bad?  I've been going here for many, many years. My son was baptized here.  Father Bob Binta has recently been transferred so 2 new priests have come on board - Fr. Victor and Fr. Hugo (I think that's his name). So far so good.  The one thing I can rave about this place is their summer bible camp.  My son LOVED it.  It was so well organized and the volunteers put so much work in to decorating for the week and I could tell they really enjoyed being with the kids.  The end of the week show that they put on was also a great treat!

We come to the Keg at least twice a year - for my birthday and my husband's birthday.  We always get the free dinner coupon via email.  Their food is always delicious.  We ordered the prime rib combination dinner:  10 oz prime rib, garlic mashed potatoes and veggies (zucchini, bell peppers and mushrooms) - medium rare.  It was good as always. We also ordered the mushrooms neptune for an appetizer and it was really good.  It came with 2 rolls to seep in any leftover juices from the mushroom sauce.  We also ordered the calamari which came out looking really sad.  It was scarce mixed in with some fried bell peppers and fried slices of jalapenos.  It seemed overcooked and had been sitting under the heating lamp for a while.  We let the manager know, who happened to be walking past our table and he quickly apologized and offered to bring us another appetizer - he suggested the bacon wrapped scallops.  When those came out, they were hot and tasted really good.  When the bill came, we saw that Chaz (manager) had taken off the calamari and comp'd us the bacon wrapped scallops.  That was really kind of him.   Overall, the service was great, our server was very accommodating and prompt.  She was super friendly.  I also like the "kids" plate that they bring out at the beginning with slices of oranges, crackers and celery.  My son enjoyed that.  We'll definitely keep coming back.

Short and sweet - this is what you should order to make it a great and incredible experience:  Appetizer: Oysters Rockefeller or Bucket of Clams  Entree: 5 lb. stuffed lobster (not on the menu) (the body cavity doesn't go to waste! they stuff it with giant scallops, bread stuffing, and crab)  Your entree also comes with a side salad (do the Tarragon dressing), baked potato and veggies.  The server will crack everything for you and sometimes the claw is so large, they have to take it to the back so the chef can do it for them. But most of the time, they can crack it using their leg as the "table".  Amazing staff, always.  The hubs and I have been going here every year for our anniversary for the past 11 years and we have never, ever, ever been disappointed.  Trust me!

Went here for dinner during a business trip.  I've always wondered about the restaurant located behind the Bellagio fountains.  The service was superb.  Our table of 4 split the beef carpaccio and tuna tartare.  Both were pretty amazing. I ordered the clams linguine.  It was probably one of the best I've ever had.  So light, so tasty with a hint of lemon juice.  The noodles weren't your regular linguine noodles but more like thin slices of lasagna.  I ate it so fast!  One of my co-workers ordered the salmon and he said it was pretty dry.  Another co-worker ordered the mushroom paparedelle.  Though, good, it was a bit on the heavy side.  The 3rd co-worker...well, honestly I can't remember what he ordered!  With drinks, appetizers and main courses our bill came close to $450.  I wouldn't say it was worth all that money, but it was good.

Love this place and at times forget about it when thinking of what to eat.  I always order their 2 item dish:  jade red chicken, emerald chicken with fried rice and refried beans.  Their bean and cheese burrito is also pretty amazing even though it's small - but it's so good.  The place on Greenway is a hole in the wall and you almost have to know how and what to order when you approach otherwise you may get the stink eye.

This place is always good but always packed - at least at this location.  The gyro definitely has  a lot of meat packed into it, and I always order an extra side of tskiti (sp) sauce.  The trio hummus with pita bread is soooo delicious.

This place is great - and even better, you get a free meal on your birthday - which is what we did. It was the hubs birthday so we came in for his free birthday meal.  The strawberry lemonade is so good - we order it every time.  The strawberries in the glass are so sweet - I probably could eat them all day. I ordered the mushroom and swiss burger, medium rare.  The husband ordered the bleu cheese burger, medium rare.  They were both delicious - juicy and very flavorful.  Our server was extremely nice and refilled our bottomless strawberry lemonades promptly.  Their steak fries are also great and I love how they have the special seasoning for the fries already on the table.

My 1st AZ Cardinals football game.  What fun and we won!  Food was decent.  Seats were great.  They didn't let me bring my small satchel purse in.  I guess it needs to be a clear bag or small as a wallet.  I guess it's for my own safety.  What a beautiful stadium.  I wonder what it looks like with the roof open.  It was closed on the day we were there due to warm weather. Been here for concerts, but not for a football game. Fun!

I went here on Sunday as a tag-a-long with my SIL who wanted to "meet" the grumpy cat.  I was shocked to see the place was PACKED to see a cat!  We waited for about 30 minutes (thankfully her friend pre-purchased a book so we had a boost in the line-waiting department).  The bookstore itself, from what I can see in between tons of people standing around was nice.  They seemed to have used books and new books there.  They also had a children's area that had toys and cool little gadgets.  This place is too far from my house to frequent, but I would definitely support this local business if I lived closer.

I really enjoyed this place.  Hubs and I were going to go to Spoke & Wheel but changed our mind and decided on Corbin's instead since we had never been there. I'm so glad we did.  The restaurant looked nothing like I thought it would on the inside.  It was kinda diner-like but a little more "upscale diner -like".    Our server (Vicki) was wonderful.  She was so friendly and made recommendations for us. She checked on us frequently and refilled our drinks promptly.    We started off with the onion rings.  I want to say this was by far the best onion rings I have ever had.  The batter was light.  It was tasty, seasoned perfectly and crunchy!  I loved it.  The hubs and I finished that in about 2 minutes! The husband and I BOTH ordered their special - it was a 6 oz steak with a lobster tail, fully loaded baked potato and steamed veggies (sliced carrots & zucchini).  All for the price of $24.95 per entree.  What a steal!  We thought that the portions were going to be too small and that we'd be hungry still but when the food did come out, it did appear that way, but we were FULL.  The steak was thick and perfectly cooked at medium rare.  The lobster tail was so tasty and extremely juicy.  The potato was large and cooked well.  I didn't care too much for the veggies but that's because everything else was so good that I didn't want to eat it!    We were definitely full by the end of the meal but we still ordered dessert because during the course of our meal, we saw desserts being taken out and they looked so good.  So we ordered the pound cake that was drenched in I think Cointreau and served with a side of vanilla ice cream.  Ohhh man, it was warm, sweet and perfect with a bite of ice cream.    We definitely will be back at this place again!

Bagel sandwiches are just A-Ok - they are actually pretty bland.  I had the black forest ham, egg & cheese breakfast sandwich on a wheat bagel and I tasted nothing.  The bagels with schmear, though, on the other hand are pretty good.  They have the new pretzel bagel that my son ate - it was really good, but I did have to scrape off some of the salt that was overloaded on it.  Go here for the bagels and schmear, go elsewhere for the sandwiches.

Why don't they allow us to give negative star reviews?  My 5 YO loves this place.  It's close to home and the price is very decent.  Today, he had no school so my parents (his grandparents) took him to Jambo and spent most of the day there.  At one point, my son was thirsty and had gone to the counter to ask for a cup for water.  The person at the counter was very kind and got a water cup for him, put ice in it and for whatever reason, put orange soda in there for him instead of water.  That was nice.     My son went to sit down in the sitting area and proceeded to drink out of his cup.  A man (who claims is the manager) stormed up to my son, GRABBED his arm and demanded to know why there was soda in there since those cups were specific for water only.  He continued to snatch the cup out of my sons hand and threw it in the trash can and huffed and puffed away.  My mother, upon seeing this went straight to him and asked him what was going on.  The "manager" exclaimed that those cups were specifically for water and why would my mom try to sneak in soda for free?  My mother tried to explain to him that it wasn't her and that it was one of the employees that did it.  He demanded that my mom tell him who it was because he was going to fire him on the spot for doing that.  My mom refused to tell him because she didn't want him to get fired over pouring a measly ounce of soda in to a cup. The "manager" continued to berate my mom for "stealing" soda and told her to go to McDonald's next time because their soda was cheaper there.    I am absolutely FLOORED by this and could not believe that someone is THAT miserable with their job that they would man-handle my son and throw a drink cup away and claim to fire someone over giving an innocent 5 YO a small plastic cup with soda.  You can bet I will NEVER come here again and you can believe that this story will be on REPEAT to ANYONE and EVERYONE that I know.  I'll also be making a trip to Jambo to confront this alleged manager.

My brother and I went back to Jambo later that evening and the moment the manager saw my mom, he ran to the back. We told my mom to wait in the car while we confronted the manager. To make a very long story short, throughout the 20 minutes of him being in denial and saying that what he did was not wrong the 2 things that stood out were:   1. ALL adults should know that ONLY water goes in to those cups and if my mom saw something otherwise, she should've poured it out (Yeah, cause my mom works there and knows their rules)   2. As to why she didn't "rat" the guy out who gave my son soda, "Let's say your son was being beat, wouldn't you want management to know who was beating him and not worry so much about him getting fired?" (Uhhh beating a child and giving him a small cup of soda is NOT comparable!!!)   His logic was so irrational. In the end, after refusing repeatedly to give us the owner or HIS managers name, he finally blurts out, "You can call here another day and ask for Jackie." My brother: Okay, who's Jackie? CHRIS: She's a black lady.  UHHHHH what does her having to be black have ANYTHING to do with this?  CHRIS: I'm not trying to be discriminatory. She's another manager. mmm okay.   We demanded a refund and at first he refused to give us one saying he was allowed to give only 2 refunds a month,  then he retracted and said, okay, if I give you a refund will you not bring this up again and leave me alone?  Will you not escalate this?  (Admitting fault, are we?).  My brother kept demanding the refund to which he gave us.  Are we satisfied? Absolutely not.  This is still going to be escalated!!!!!

We decided to have this for dinner on a whim last night - and called to place a To-Go order about 30 minutes before they were closing.  We felt a little bad, but hey we were hungry and we didn't want fast food.  There were 3 of us, so we all ordered the same thing - Pollo Fundido.  It came with a side of beans and rice and some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes.  We also got a bag of tortilla chips and salsa (spicy and mild).  The guy who answered the phone didn't seem too thrilled to be taking an order before closing.  But when we went there to pick up the food they were actually friendly and gave us extra salsa for our chips without even asking.  That was cool.  We were able to place our order and pick up our food even before the restaurant closed.  The pollo fundido's were absolutely delicious and hit the spot!!  We were mmm'ing and awwww'ing almost every bite.  I would definitely order this dish again and again.  They served a lot of Mexican rice, which I wasn't too excited about, but I'm not a big fan of Mexican rice anyway...but the refried beans were great.  I'm officially a fan of this place!

You really can't go wrong with this place since their menu is so extensive.  My favorite are the steak sandwich and the angel hair pasta with shrimp in vodka sauce.  The food is plentiful and reasonably priced.  They are also open late.  I hear the beer is great, too, but I'm not a beer drinker.

Came here for an impromptu toddler birthday gathering - nothing fancy.  We each brought food to share with the other families.  The park is huge but we stayed within the "amusement park" area for the kids.  Signs clearly posted that no outside food or beverage was allowed since they had their own snack bar in there....so we were like well crap, we have all this food that we brought and we didn't want to eat outside in the park since the kids were all enjoying the rides....so yes, we broke the rules and ate inside where we weren't supposed to, right in front of the employee door in and out of the snack bar. And you know what? None of them cared.   There were a handful of rides: Ferris wheel, ATV-like bikes that go in circles, the train that goes around the park and the carousel.  There were other rides that accepted coins - those typical ones you see outside of grocery stores.  For $9 you can get an unlimited wrist band and your child can ride unlimited.  Otherwise, they are a $1/ticket and the train itself is already $3.  We bought our son the $9 wrist band and he went on each ride at least 4 times so we got our monies worth.  Only thing was that they were probably high school kids that worked there under no supervision.  They were goofing off with each other most of the time, having water hose fights while cleaning the actual birthday party area.  The rides weren't always occupied by an employee - you'd have to stand in line and sometimes wave someone down to come over and let the kids in.    You can also buy a box of old popcorn for 50 cents to feed the ducks.  I don't know how healthy that is for them.  Other than that, I wasn't too impressed by this park.  The McCormick Ranch Stillman Railroad park is by far better and cleaner.

My SIL and I were craving sushi and so we Yelp'd what was around us.  We chose to go here over JK Sushi (as we've been there before and wanted to try something new).  The location is in a strip mall and can be easily missed.  Inside was quaint and small - but clean.  The service was very nice.  We order 3 sushi rolls, a hand roll, salmon sashimi and I took a pork cutlet with rice home for the husband.  All for under $55.  Not bad at all.  The sushi was decent, the salmon sashimi extremely fresh.  The complimentary salad they gave us at the beginning was small, but good and just enough to get us started.  It was super quiet in the restaurant though - maybe playing a little background music would help ease the silence.  I would definitely come back here again.

I choose Safeway over all other grocery stores (unless it's Costco).  They have such friendly and helpful employees that work there.  They always say hello, they always ask if you need help finding anything.  I also really enjoy their "Just4U" phone app  where I get additional savings and freebies throughout the month.  Yes, Safeway is a little more expensive then say Fry's or Walmart, but I'd take their customer service and store cleanliness over bad service and dirty stores.

I came here this past weekend to witness a friend of mine receive her 1st Holy Communion and to be welcomed in to the Catholic Church during her RCIA process.  The church is quite big and very beautiful.

Love this grocery store.  I usually never shop at Fry's and shop at Safeway, but this is the ONLY Fry's store that I will go to.  It's fancy and always has items that you wouldn't normally find in a regular grocery store.  We usually only come here though for the pastry department....and the fresh sushi.  There's a sushi roll there that we always have to get when we stop by and it never fails us.  For some reason, I can't remember the name, but it's basically a california roll with some mayo spicy sauce drizzled on top.  The guy who stands there and yells out "fresh sushi" could take a break though, his voice is annoying.    Anyway, my review here is for the pastry department.  We have ordered our sons birthday cake here for the past 2 years....last year they were cupcakes with angry bird rings on top.  Delish!  This year, we ordered a quarter sheet white cake with whipped cream topping using their Despicable Me theme of Minions on the cake.  The cake turned out the exact same way the picture did.  We were impressed - and more so, we were so impressed by the taste of the cake.  It was so good!  Our guests also asked where we purchased the cake.  So kudos to the pastry chefs at the Fry's on Shea & Tatum!  We'll definitely be coming back.    There's also some limited cover parking which is great for those super hot days - but expect to drive around if you're looking for a spot.  And they have valet, too, for the super lazy. They also will wash your car for you (for a fee) if you want, while you're shopping.

A fast food joint I don't get to frequent very often.  Though it's a bit pricey for "fast food", I'd have to say the quality is pretty delish.  I love their roast beef sandwiches smothered in Arby Sauce and Horsey Sauce.  I definitely miss the days of 5 for $5 sandwiches.  The sandwiches have definitely gotten smaller than back in the days, but still taste the same.  Their potato cakes are so crunchy and perfectly cooked.  I'd choose those over the curly fries.  Until we meet again...probably in another year.

I do like my Starbucks - I haven't been able to choose a favorite yet although today I tried the Grande Caramel Flan Latte with Soy milk and so far, it's better than the other drinks I have had - hope this one stays around for a while.

I am not a huge chocolate fan....but after coming here, I think I may have changed my mind.  I would never have thought of coming into this cute boutique shop if it weren't for the Yelp Elite event that I attended.  Julia Baker was there and told us how she got to where she was.  What an amazing woman and such a go-getter. I could've sat there and listened to her talk all night.  I wish her the best of luck with her future endeavors including her show coming up on the Food Network.    During this stop, Julia served us with Prosecco - I'm not a huge fan, but she accommodated by offering Moscato - now that's what I like!  We were also served a chocolate martini...in my mind, I kept thinking, ugh, I'm not going to like this....but after I took my sip, I chugged that thing down and wanted more!  The chocolate was so creamy and the alcohol content in there just made it perfect.   Three desserts were served - a chocolate hazelnut with a cookie-like crust at the bottom.  Again, not a chocolate lover, but this was absolutely scrumptious and I cleaned off that dessert like it was nobody's business.  Second dessert was red velvet - which was just that, velvety and delicious.  Not dry and perfectly moist.  The last dessert was her white chocolate with passion fruit and coconut.  Because I do not like coconut, this was my least favorite.    We were also given a little 2-piece sample in a cute box with a pink ribbon on it.  When I got home, my 5-year old gobbled it down before I could even eat it!! He came to me with chocolate all around his mouth saying it was delicious.  I believe him!  This place has a back area that can be curtained off for private parties, book clubs, showers, etc.  I will definitely be coming back to this gem and buy gifts for friends in the future!  And Julia, if you're reading this....maybe we have met somewhere before....I used to work in the hotel & restaurant industry and I know Chuck amongst some other Chefs....so I'm sure we have crossed paths before.  :) Hope to see you again!

This place is awesome and I wish I still lived on that side of town.  Now, it's over a 30 minute drive for me to get there.  All of their food is amazing and at such unbelievable prices.  We always order from their Hong Kong Style menu.  The service is also great.  It's family owned so you'll see the parents and grown adult kids helping out.

This is our 2nd visit to the dentist for our son and we all love it.  The waiting area is perfect to entertain him while we wait.  The staff is extremely pleasant and energetic, it makes my son happy to come there.  When our son leaves, he gets tokens for having great teeth which he can in turn put in to the toy dispenser and receive prizes.  He also receives a balloon, stickers and a pouch with his name on it with other goodies including a new toothbrush and toothpaste.  Dr. Libby is outgoing and makes my son feel super special.  Their staff is pretty extensive - 1 person to check us in, 1 person to do his cleaning, 1 person to do his x-rays, 1 person (hygenist) to check his teeth, then Dr. Libby comes in for the final check, then 1 more person at final check-out.  Great experience with each person though.  Wish they did adult teeth! :)

Though the furniture and accessories here can get pricey, I feel that it is worth it since it is quality furniture.  I guess I could go and spend a fraction of that at Ikea but I know I'd have to replace it in a year.  We bought a leather sectional and dining table set here - the service was great - the woman (assuming was the manager) was helpful and had a lot of great advice on how to place our sectional in our house.    We had everything delivered the next day and the delivery men were also nice.    I'd recommend this place if you're looking to spend money on something you know will last you many, many years.  Also, support your local family businesses!

This was perfect for our son.  We did this place for his 4th birthday and this year, for his 5th birthday.  He absolutely loves it.  Though it's pricier than if you were to do it at home, it was worth it for us.  We did absolutely nothing except bring his birthday cake and we also chose to make our own goodie bags as we were able to save some money that way - you can certainly order goodie bags through Pump It Up.   I won't repeat what other yelpers said as far as how it works, because that's how it was for us - 40 minutes each in 2 rooms, 40 minutes in the party room.  The kids loved the rooms and were so darn sweaty! They were having a blast.  Our 2 "helpers" were very nice and always came and checked with my husband and I to make sure everything was going well and if we needed anything.  Super friendly yet very professional, considering they were young - probably in high school/early college?   There was a person who called the day before to confirm and helped me place our pizza and drinks order.  Note that ordering pizza and drinks is completely optional, so you can save money there, too, if you chose to not order.  Their large cheese pizza is $16 and a large 1-item is $18.  Their drinks come in liters and are $2.50/each.  They will start you off with 2 bottles and as time goes on, if you want more soda, they'll bring it out and add it to your bill.   We chose not to have our son open his presents at the party, so halfway through the party, one of the Pump It Up reps came and asked for my car keys, and they took all the presents and loaded it into our car.  How awesome is that?    We literally had to do nothing - no clean up, no serving food, nothing.  It was easy and convenient.  In the end, for the 2 hour play ($275) and the pizza, soda and tip, our total came to $400.  Pricey? Yes.  Worth it? Definitely.    Why is it that even though we did nothing, the hubs and I came home completely tired???

I love me some chick-fil-a.  Their waffle fries are the bomb and their chicken sandwiches are so delicious and juicy.  I love their Polynesian sauce on top of everything!  I also love their great customer service.  They seem genuinely happy to work there.

Ack. I don't know why my brain tells me every once in a while that this place is a good idea.  After spending nearly $30 on my husband, toddler and I, I get irritated that basically a soup and salad buffet is way too expensive.  Though they have a good variety of soups, and salads, I can't justify the price.  Other items that are available are slices of pizza, sweet potato and baked potatoes, 3 pasta selections hiding in the corner and appear to have been sitting there under the heat lamp for days.  They really need to either cook smaller portions or replenish them every so often instead of leaving it in there to crust up.  They also have muffins and a dessert bar.  Again, I don't know why out of all the selections in Desert Ridge made me chose this place. I'm pretty sure I told myself that I'd never eat here again the last time I was here. So I say it again....I will not eat here again.

This place is pretty awesome!  We came here for a friends birthday party.  The pool area is so cool - it has a kids area with a wading pool, a play area where you can use water cannons to shoot at people passing by on the lazy river or people walking by.  There are several slides for adults and little toddlers.  There are lifeguards everywhere.  I heard it's only $4 to come here...though water parks are a lot bigger (and more expensive), this place would be just as perfect.  It's clean and not that crowded.  There's also a full service snack bar.  Inside is a gym for basketball, volleyball, pool tables and a rock climbing wall.

I came here to purchase about 2 feet of fabric to complete the costume that we had made for our son.  Of course I was a procrastinator so it appears I was there with the rest of the world.  I had to take a number and wait, I kid you not, about 40 minutes to have them cut my 2 feet of fabric.  When I did finally get to the counter, the girl was friendly.  Then it was time to go pay for my fabric - alas, another line that I waited about 20 minutes for.  After about 1 hour, I was finally out the door with my 2 feet of fabric.  Good times.

This theater is great because it never gets super crowded like other Harkin's theaters during opening weekend of movies.  The service is friendly and the facility is clean.  I hope that soon they will have a kids playcenter for the days hubs and I want to go on a date night.  The only downfall (1st world problems) is they took away the butter dispensers from the condiment stations. There's never enough butter! :)

My brother took me here the other day for lunch for my first time.  It was great!  Their gyro combo which includes a drink and fries is so reasonably priced at $7.95 +tax.  Free refills on the drink and the fries are seasoned well and extra crunchy.  I love it.  The meat in the gyro is thick and plentiful.  I asked for extra tzatziki sauce - which I don't think they charged extra for.  This is certainly a hole in the wall with excellent food inside.  I'll definitely frequent this place more often for lunch.

Is this place closing down? Every time I come here, the spaces that used to house products are now disappearing and there's tons of empty space in the store. I really hope not as I enjoy this location since it's much closer than their Chandler location.    I love Lee Lee's because it carries just about any international item that you may need (food-wise).  Barely anyone there speaks English very well, but that's okay because I usually already know what I need and which aisle it is in.  The cool thing is that each aisle is organized by country - it is also labeled on signs above each aisle.    The also have a great meat and seafood section. You can pick a live fish from the tank and they will filet and fry it for you for free.    Overall, the prices here are less expensive then what you would see in an "American" grocery store - that is if the "American" grocery store carries that item.

I came here on a travelzoo deal ($71 for a 50 minute massage, glass of champagne, coconut oil scalp massage and access to the revive relaxation pool).  After changing in to my robe and relaxing on one of their lounge chairs, I was called back in to one of the massage rooms - my therapist was named Jessica...or Jennifer I think and she was very nice and accommodating.  My massage was great and very relaxing.  The 50 minutes went by so fast but it was still great.  Afterwards, I took advantage of the jacuzzi, steam room and pool.  I definitely made the most of my day there and then proceeded to go back home to face my reality of a 5 year old and the husband! :)

I don't eat here that often, but when i do, I am never disappointed.  Service is generally pretty good and the food portions are quite large.  My favorite there of course is the matzo ball soup.  It basically is a delicious tasting chicken noodle soup with a giant matzo ball (my favorite part). It also comes with a side of bagel chips to soak into your soup.  This most recent visit, I decided to order the Jewish slider combo meal which came with 2 Jewish sliders, matzo ball soup and cole slaw.  Though the cole slaw was sooooo good, the portion was a "sample size" which came in this tiny plastic sample size bowl - basically like those bowls you get at restaurants to put your ketchup in.  I was disappointed in the portion of that.  But the sliders were so good.  It was juicy, the bun was soft, the potato cakes were delish.  We also trek over to the bakery since my son gets a cupcake for good behavior - I do check in with foursquare because when you do, if you buy a bakery item you get a free specialty bagel.  Lets jump on board with that, Yelp!

I like North because the food there is consistently good.  The service on the other hand is a hit or miss.  Ate dinner there with the hubs and toddler the other day.  We ordered the burrata and the zucca chips for appetizers.  The zucca chips were delish, as always.  The burrata was  not all that great.  But that's okay - I wanted to try it and I did.  I ordered the Atlantic Salmon which was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious with the butternut squash.  Hubs had the pork tenderloin which was medium rare and cooked to perfection.  I just love the food here.   Service was a bit off for us tonight.  Drinks were not refilled.  Visits to see how we were doing were not very frequent, if at all.  We used a $100 gift card to pay for our meal which came out to $95 and some change.  We also gave her a $20 bill in cash and asked for $5 back - giving her a $15 tip. I was expecting to get my gift card back since there were a few dollars on there but it never came back.  When leaving, I asked if I was going to get my card back but she went on to tell me that she took my balance of my gift card and used it as tip towards herself ON TOP of the $15 that I already gave her.  Normally, I wouldn't mind giving a 20% tip but it was not deserved.  And one thing that IRKS me to no end is when a server ASSUMES that we don't need change back.  That alone made me irritated.    Please tell your servers not to ask if they need change back and don't assume it, either! I overheard another server at the table next to me asking if they needed change back and they said yes!! It's rude!!!

This is my husband's favorite ice cream shop.  Since it's quite a drive from our house, we don't get to go that often, but the times we do, Sweet Republic never disappoints.  They have such a great variety of uncommon flavors.  The hubs always buys a scoop or two there and then purchases a pint of their lime basil sorbet to-go every single time.  I'm not going to lie, I'm a pretty boring ice-cream eater, so I always just eat the Madagascar vanilla bean ice-cream.  I figure, if it ain't broke, don't fix it! :)

I would never frequent this place as it's 40+ miles from our house, but the husband works out in Gilbert so today I came to visit him and we went there to eat.  The place is great!!! And very inexpensive!  I ordered the Orient Chicken Special and for lunch, it's $5.95 and comes in a bento box filled with a large portion of chicken, garlic & onion dipping sauce, salad and rice.  Before that, it came out with a bowl of soup (I chose the hot & sour which was delicious).  The husband ordered the bento chicken katsu, which again came out as a large portion.  Our son had the kids chow mein with chicken for $4.95 and it came out in this huge dish!  The service was good and the food tasted great.  Oh! And their sushi is always half off, with the exception of their sashimi and specialty rolls.  We ordered the tootsie roll for $5.00 and it was really good!  If we lived closer, I'd definitely be eating at this place a lot more.  At least the husband has a great lunch spot to go to when he's at work.

I love, love this movie theater.  It's clean, it's friendly and it has lots of perks.  The best perk?  The playcenter.  For $6 you can drop your child off for the duration of your movie.  They don't take tips (we've tried). The staff there is super friendly and our 5-YO loves to go there.  They give the kids popcorn and water.  And while inside, they do arts & crafts, play video games, watch movies, and have tons of toys.  There is a bathroom in the playcenter so your child never leaves the supervised area.  The doors are locked and only the playcenter staff can unlock the door.  There are usually 2-3 people working in the playcenter.  Reservations are not required but recommended.  They have a cap and once it is filled, you are out of luck.  The parent and child have matching bracelets and the parent also gets a pager in case they are needed.  The playcenter is also full of windows so you can look right in and see what your little tyke is up to.    Another perk?  $1.50 refills if you have their Harkins cup.  Free Medium popcorn if you have the Harkins shirt.  Towards the end of the year, they have a deal where you can purchase the cup, t-shirt and 2 free popcorn vouchers for $20.    When the hubs and I go to see a matinee, we spend $23 for a movie, 2 drinks, a popcorn AND a "babysitter".  It can't get any better than that!

Hubs and I used to frequent this place when we lived closer, but now that we have moved, it's rare for us to visit....but every time we visit, we are never disappointed.  We actually have never ordered sushi there but have come for the korean food.  Their kalbi is always meaty and flavorful.  We also order the mandu gook soup which is a dumpling soup with noodles and a delicious light broth.  Their "free" side dishes are always delightful, too.  My favorite are the fish cakes and potato cakes.  The little man for some reason, always loves to eat the soy bean sprouts.  We also will usually order the dolsot bibimbap - the korean fried rice in a stone pot.  Oh so delicious. Now I want to go there and eat some Korean food.  The service there is always awesome.  I think it's a brother/sister that work the front and the parents are the cooks.  But both siblings are super nice and always remember us even if it's been a long time since we've been back. Maybe someday I'll try the sushi if I'm not always craving the Korean food so much!

Came here to buy some clothes for our son for his school year.  We came over Labor Day and they had a sale of an extra 30% off everything.  We bought him 3 pairs of shorts, a pair of pants, a lunch box, a lunch container, a 10-pack pair of ankle socks, a plastic cup with straw (for home) for about $65.  I always like Old Navy  because they carry not only clothes, but cute knick knacks at the front of the store.  Their clothes are reasonably priced and pretty decent quality.  One thing I love are their $5 July 4th t-shirts.  The fabric gets softer after each wash and makes it soooo comfy to wear!

I've only been to 2 Love's travel stops - on the way to Los Angeles and San Diego.  They are both consistent with each other in that they have very friendly people working there, bathrooms are clean and gas is reasonably priced.  They also have a great french vanilla cappuccino maker there.

Stopped by here after having dinner with a friend.  It was not crowded at all.  The place was clean.  I had a small serving of vanilla yogurt in their gigantic cups.  Yelp had a 20% off check-in offer which made my yogurt come out to $1.73.  Woot!

My family and I have been coming here for the past 4 years every summer for our annual staycation.  The rooms are big and clean and the Heavenly beds are just that - heavenly.  The Villas pool can get a bit busy during the peak summer months and there are tons of kids every where.  You can also take the shuttle or drive over to the main hotel and swim in their main pool that has a lazy river, a beach and the wave runner thing - which is $45 to do.   There are daily activities going on every day and some you have to pay for.  Same goes with the main hotel pool.   Service here is pretty friendly.  Especially at the front desk.  When we checked in, the guy at the front desk allowed my son to come sit on the check in counter and he helped him make our room keys.  That was pretty awesome and my son loved it.    As a timeshare owner, the housekeeping came only once - on Tuesday.  If we want them to come more often, there are fees for it depending on what you wanted: $8 for towel service, $25 full room cleaning, etc.    Cabana rental used to be a flat $50 per day fee, but now they are charged based on tiers and which tier you want to use.    The only thing I don't like is how the pool closes so early - 8 pm.  And the slide closes at 6 pm.  Another negative is that the wi-fi there is horrible.  I always end up having to use my 4G network to get better internet which eats into my data plan.

This place was packed on Saturday for brunch.  So packed that they had to stop the line from ordering for 15 minutes so the kitchen could catch up.    I was with my family - a party of 9.  Luckily we were able to find a place to sit outside that accommodated all of us considering how busy it was. You have to scout for your own table so on a busy day you have to be an expert with the eagle eye and find your table before someone else does.  Food was really good - I had the eggs benedict and an orange juice.  The service was nice considering how busy they were.  I would definitely come back again.

What a great local business.  Small and quaint and friendly staff.  We always order off the menu that's posted on the walls handwritten on paper.  We have never had a dish we haven't liked and the prices are so reasonable!  Their cinnamon rolls are absolutely delicious.

This place is hidden in the corner of  strip mall.  I found it via Yelp.  If you are dining in, go ahead and have a seat at one of their tables and they will bring the menus to you.  If you are doing take out, head straight to the cashier counter and place your order.  One of the women there always comes off quiet and a little stand-offish, but as the evening progresses, she starts to warm up and is a little friendlier.  This has happened on both occasions that we dined there.  The food is good - the fries are steak fries that are hot and crunchy!!  I can eat a whole basket of those.  The gyros are plentiful with the meat and I order an extra side of tzakiki sauce.  On some weekends they have belly dancers or a musical act of some kind.  We have yet to come on one of those nights, but definitely would like to be back to partake.

I used to come to Paradise bakery just for their cookies and chippers.  But now I've come to love their Spinach Power salad and their steak and white cheddar panini.  Both are so delicious and make me full after lunch.  I also get their large iced tea every time - whichever their flavor of the day is.    They are pretty on top of getting through lines - there are stations and people are manning each station so there's no confusion.  If you want a soup or salad, skip the area where you would order a sandwich - it will save you time.  Just go directly to the station that you want and order your food.    I also have their frequent diner card which allows me to get free cookies or salads or sandwiches sometimes.

I've always received pretty good service in here whenever I had an issue with my iphone.  We're always greeted the moment we walk in and are asked what the visit is for so they can direct us in the right direction.  They have an area with ipads full of kids games where my son can sit and play while we're waiting for someone to help us.

I love this place!!  I come here mainly when I am craving bo nuong vi.  It's so inexpensive and so delicious!  It's definitely a meal that needs to be shared with at least 1 other person.  Their pho and rice dishes are also delicious.  I haven't had a bad meal here yet.  Their service is not that great, but considering it's a hole in the wall Vietnamese restaurant, you can't expect 5 star service.  That's just how it is.  The restaurant is also quite large but come on a weekend for lunch or for dinner any night of the week, you'll probably expect a wait - but not a long one.

This is not THE best place for Pho, but it works because it's close to us.  We've been here enough times that the owner and server recognize us and remember our sons name.   The hubs always orders the pho dac biet with no meatballs.  The little man orders a kids pho (not on the menu, but if you ask, they'll do it for you), and I switch between the pho and the bun cha gio thit nuong.    Their spring rolls are not very good here, but their fried egg rolls are pretty tasty - and are super hot (not spicy hot, but just out of the fryer hot) so be careful when taking your first bite.    We definitely would come here again (and we do!).

I've been coming to Viet Kitchen as long as it first opened. I don't like to write novels, so here's the gist of it.  Their egg rolls are pretty darn good.  Fried and crisp to perfection.  Their bun cha gio thit nuong is also really good and very refreshing for a hot day.  Their pho tai gan sach is good, also. Not really a dish on the menu, but definitely not something hard for them to put together.   Their service is pretty awesome.  Considering most Asian restaurants have rude staff that don't speak English very well, this establishment has very friendly people working here.  They'll answer any questions you have and actually come back to check on you and refill your drinks without you having to ask.

Ahhh if only this place was closer to my house! I love it!  I usually come and order the kalbi and a bowl of duk mandu soup.  But this time I decided to order the dolsot bibimbap which is basically a Korean version of fried rice in a stone hot pot. I usually let it sit for a while so the bottom of my rice gets crunchy.  This is true comfort food.    The lady (assuming the owner) is very friendly and will help you with any questions you have.  The only odd thing was that my son wanted to drink an iced tea and she gave me a confused look and questioned how a little boy would like an iced tea.  Weird.    They also state they are open until 2 am every night, but the hubs came one night at 1 am with his buddies and they were closed - it must have been a slow night.

What a cute outdoor mall.  I don't know how it survives during the summer as it's so darn hot out outside, but yesterday was a cool 83 degrees with a breeze.  So we wanted to take advantage of the outdoors - plus the hubs needed to go the Apple store.  They have a lot of shops out there including H&M, Gap and Lulumon. Also some cute boutique shops.  And of course their dine-in theather, IPic is there, too.  They have a neat splash pad with kids running around.  Also plenty of restaurants.  It's also across the street from the Kierland Commons where they have plenty more restaurants and shops, too, if you can't find what you need at the Quarters.

I've eaten here twice, and though others have raved about this place, I don't see it as anything outstanding.  The service is definitely great - they are family owned and super friendly.  The food is fresh and the crab puffs definitely are tasty.  The first time we came, I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl - it came with some veggies and rice.  Though it was hot and fresh, the taste wasn't amazing - but it was good. The 2nd time I ordered the BBQ pork - I thought it'd be more like "char siu" but it wasn't - it was just drizzled with teriyaki sauce.  The meat was plentiful of course.  I will keep coming here since our house is nearby when I have those bowl cravings.

I absolutely love Dr. Pottgen.  She's been my sons pediatrician since he was born.  It's great to have consistency and have her there throughout his years.  He's familiar with her and he trusts her.  She always takes her time with us and answers any questions we may have.  If she doesn't have an answer, she finds out for us right away.  The facility is also nice. It's clean and has friendly ladies working at the front desk.  There are "sick" and "well" entrances which is nice in that it separate the kids who are sick and the ones who are there for regular check-ups.

This place is pretty awesome.  You can watch through the window when they make your homemade noodles. It's pretty impressive and the kids love it.  Service is quick, but the service itself is almost nonexistent but the most Asian restaurants are like that so I don't expect anything more or less.  I ordered the seafood noodle dish. The broth was tasty and the noodles had a great texture with chewy perfection.  The hubs had the lamb with noodles which he enjoyed and the toddler had the beef noodle soup.  All were pretty good.  We also ordered the pan fried dumplings and holy cow they were huge.  It was also very good and juicy.  Wish this place wasn't so far from our house because we'd frequent it very often.

Dillon's is a great place to go that is close to my house and has really good baby back ribs.  The service here has always been good to us.  We now know never to come there on a Wednesday night....We recently came to dinner on a Wednesday night with our 3-YO son and they seated us in the "bar" area since the rest of the restaurant was completely empty.  It was comedy night.  Lets just say we couldn't eat our food fast enough before ALL 4 of the "comedians" spouted out just about every cuss word you could imagine on top of making disgusting sexual and racist jokes.  The sad part is that the crowd also seemed a bit put off, as no one laughed.  Even the comedians said we were a tough crowd.  If I had ear muffs, they would've been around my sons ears.  I'm surprised that the server didn't seat us in the other room or at least warn us that the comedians used this kind of language.  And it's not the 1st time either since we told our friends about it and they said it was the same thing the week before when they were there.  I ended up not even finishing my dinner and spent a lot of the time letting him play outside while my husband finished his dinner.  Aside from that bad experience, we just know not to come on that night anymore.  Other than that, their mac n' cheese is really good, baby back ribs are good and their bbq beans are a hit.

If I was able to label this as 0 stars, I would have. But I cannot.  It has been a very long time since I have written a review. I'm usually always using yelp to figure out if I want to eat somewhere unfamiliar by reading other reviews.    We should have read the reviews for this place before heading out - but we all love churros, how could it be bad, right?  I will not make this a long post as I, as a reader, generally just skip through most of it to find out whether the place is nay or yay - so here goes...  The place was absolutely empty.  The "xooro" was about $5 a pop.  Super expensive when it came to around $28 for the 4 that we ordered.   When they say they make it fresh, it is NOT fresh.  They grab a "xooro" that's been sitting there for who knows how long because when we bit into our own xooro's, it was hard.  I guess when they mean "fresh", they mean they will shove whatever flavor you want into the xooro and coat it in the mass amounts of chocolate that's been sitting out for a while.  The weirdest part?  They put it in some machine that makes it come out COLD.  I guess it's to harden up the chocolate that it was soaked in, but who eats cold churro's?    On top of that, it took the kid about 5 minutes to make 1 xooro and then when he placed it in the machine to make it cold, we had no idea so we stood there and stared at him wondering where our xooro went.    This place will be out of business soon. Mark my words.  Our xooro's went into the trash after 1 bite.

Jimmy John's is my favorite place for subs/sandwiches.  We order from here often for our office.  Today, we had 3 attorney's working out of our office from out of town and when they asked what would be quick and good for lunch, I jumped up and said Jimmy John's!!  So we ordered 4 sandwiches.  After 45 minutes, our sandwiches still had not arrived, which is so strange as we always get our orders within 15 minutes of ordering it.  The attorney's had to go back in to their depositions and were a bit angry that they'd be missing their lunch.  I called to find out what the deal was and spoke to the manager, I think his name was Ollie?  But I told him of the situation and he accommodated me (I don't want to say what because I don't want people to start abusing the situation).  But he also apologized profusely and was very genuine.  It didn't take me getting irate with him in order for him to make things right, and that, to me, is excellent customer service.  You should never have to wait for a customer to get upset in order to make things right.  I will continue to keep coming here for our business lunch needs.  I have not lost faith in them and it's thanks to the manager!

This place was pretty good.    It was a weekday so the place was pretty dead.  Our server was pretty attentive and extremely knowledgeable of the menu.  He recommended stuff to us that ended up ordering and were happy with.  We ordered the Six Shooters (tortilla crusted hand stuffed cheddar, bacon filled jalapeno shots with a cilantro buttermilk sauce) - it was too spicy for me, but the other 3 enjoyed them.  We also ordered the Nachos (Large corn tortilla rounds with drunken black beans, pulled pork, serrano chile, fire roasted tomato and tomatillo salsa, and a blend of cheddar, manchego, monterrey jack cheese and mexican crema cheeses.)  Pretty darn amazing.    The hubs ordered the fish tacos which were pretty tasty and filled him up.  I ordered the fajitas, which was nothing special and could be eaten at any other restaurant that served fajitas.  My brother ordered the pan roasted pork tenderloins which were cooked perfectly medium-rare and was probably the best dish out of all of ours.  My SIL ordered the enchilada - and quite honestly, I don't remember if she liked it or not.  In the end, we decided to try to cuban corn - which was by far, the best!  I could have eaten more if there was any left.    For the 4 of us, it was almost $180 (including tip).  A bit pricey, but I would go back - even if it was just for the corn on the cob...and the great service.

While staying at the Westin, we decided to have breakfast here since it was close.  The wait for our party of 5 was about 20 minutes.  When it was our turn, the hostess called our name and so we followed her into the restaurant (we had been waiting outside)...we stood at the front area while she told us to wait just a moment as they were getting our table ready.  As we stood there for a couple of minutes, another hostess came up and pretty much scolded us telling us that we needed to wait outside instead of blocking the register area while our table was getting cleared.  That was rude.   I ordered the fancy scramble which wasn't all that fancy.  They were scrambled eggs with a slice of brie and a dollop of fig splatted on top.  I could've done that myself at home.  My BIL ordered the huevos rancheros which he stated was pretty good.  The kids had the silver dollar pancakes which they devoured.  Unfortunately I can't remember what my hubs and SIL ordered - which means it must not have been that memorable.    Our server was pretty good though and she was attentive.  Coffee and waters were refilled promptly.  I probably would not come here again unless majority ruled.

I enjoy this restaurant because it has friendly service and good food.  The original pizza is doughy and thick and the crust is chewy. The side salad is fresh and I love the thick mozzarella cheese that they use.  Drinks are free refills.  Our son loves their pasta with butter, which comes with a slice of garlic bread and a kids drink for $4.99.  Order at the counter and they give you a number.  Sit and wait for it to come to you. I am definitely a repeat customer.

We stopped by here since we were in the neighborhood after visiting with friends.  The place looks nice from the outside - similar to a large log cabin.  Service was friendly inside, food was plentiful, but to me, did not taste good.  It lacked a lot of flavor and quite a few food items had been sitting out for a while.  I would not come back to this place as I would be able to spend my $40 (2 adults, 1 child) some place nicer with better quality food.

Been here several times for a girls night out and holiday company parties.  It's been fun every time - you can bring your own food and drink and they take you step by step on how to paint a picture that you thought you never would be able to do.  It's a lot of fun!

Total hole-in-the-wall but absolutely delicious.  We were concerned considering the location in a very run down almost empty strip mall. We found this on a fluke.  Tall caucasion guy (whom I think owns the place) speaks Spanish fluently and is super nice and totally helped us out with deciding what we should eat.    The Oaxacan hot dog - phenomenal.    The street tacos were also a delight.  We tried so many things on the menu that night and none of them disappointed.    Only downside is there is no a/c besides those ones that you stick into a window.  So summer time can get pretty toasty in there.  Cheap eats! A must try!

I came here for Sunday brunch with my mom, sister, niece and SIL.  Girls day out.  We were seated outside in the front patio.  The ambiance is great.  So cozy.    - Crab & Avocado Tower $13.00 - delicious.  Crab was tasty and meshed well with the avocado and salsa. - Warm Brie with Caramelized Apples $13.00 - How can warm brie and caramelized apples ever be anything but good? - Strawberry Chicken Salad $14.00 - Was a bit too tart for us. We didn't finish this dish although we've been told it's their most popular salad. - Chicken, Wild Mushroom and Leek Crepes $15.00 - this was pretty tasty and we gobbled it up.  There was still sauce leftover and we were offered bread to sop up the sauce, but we were too full. - Wild Mushroom, Spinach and Goat Cheese Tart $14.00 - pretty good but after several bites, it does start to get a little heavy from the goat cheese. - Warm Grilled Rosemary Ham Sandwich $13.00 - this was probably my most favorite out of everything we shared.  The bread was fresh and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The whole mustard aioli completed the sandwich.    This place is definitely cute and a perfect place to go with your girlfriends.  It would also be a great place to host a bridal or baby shower.  They also have private rooms across the street and if I remember correctly, a bakery across the street, too.    Staff overall was friendly, but the hostess who sat us, Polly stood out the most as she was friendly, cheery and informative.

The guys who work here are great.  They are friendly, professional and know their stuff.  Travis, I believe, is the store manager and is very knowledgeable about their merchandise.  I came in to purchase my iphone 6 and my phone arrived more than a week earlier than scheduled.  The transaction was flawless.  They didn't try to "push" me to buy anything else (as others have written).  I'd definitely come back again if I needed to.

Food was decent. Our server, Christine, was nice and attentive, especially to our 4 yr old. Our wings took a long time to come out and voluntarily, the manager came out and apologized and comp'd our wings. Nice gesture instead of waiting for us to get mad before they did anything.

I LOVE Grimaldi's.  If it wasn't a pricey dinner every time, I'd be here all the time!  But for the cost, it's worth it. I just don't have that kind of money to spend every time.  You have the choice to build your own pizza or chose from one of their suggestions.  The small is quite large and can easily be shared between 2 people.  If you're super hungry, a large can also feed a party of 2 (with maybe 1 or 2 pieces to take home).    We always build our own pizza.  Our favorite is the "white" pizza - which basically means it has a lot of garlic and no red sauce on it.  I like to order: white pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni and dollops of ricotta cheese.  Perfectly delicious!  Service there is always great.    For kids, if you ask, they'll bring out pizza dough for them to play with.  Keeps them entertained for quite some time.

Love this place. Staff is friendly and donuts always fresh!  they also have great breakfast burritos that I usually favor while I'm there.   Just the simple egg and cheese burrito with a side of salsa makes my belly full.  It also helps that the staff usually throws a couple of complimentary donut holes to our order each time. :)

This place was packed for a Tuesday night!  Thankfully I made an open table reservation for 6:30 pm.  I had ordered off their winter menu:  Black Cherry BBQ Pork Tenderloin* Apple brine marinated and grilled with ginger black cherry BBQ glaze. Served with white cheddar mashed potatoes and bacon sautéed Brussels sprouts. 17.95.  It was pretty tasty although I felt the tenderloin was a little overcooked.  The brussel sprouts were delicious.  The service was great - our server was attentive. I would definitely come back here again if I were in the area.

I am never disappointed when I go to North.  This time around, the hubs and I decided to go to their 40th St & Camelback location as we usually frequent the Kierland location.  This place appeared to be bigger and more open spaced.  We really liked that.  The kitchen itself was also more open which gave a nice feeling all around.  Our server was very attentive and bubbly.  We ordered our usual zucca chips and opted to try the roasted cauliflower appetizer and split their kale salad.  Both were really good and it was nice that they split our salad plate up - and they were still large portions.  For our entree, I ordered the strazzopoli (spelling as I can't remember exactly the name), and the husband ordered the ricotta gnocchi with braised short ribs.  We both really enjoyed our entrees and even made room for dessert!  I think we'll start coming to this location more often as the space was a big factor for us.  We didn't feel like we were eating at other patrons tables.  They do have mandatory complimentary valet so we just tipped a couple of dollars when we left, even though the guy had to walk maybe 10 steps to get our car.

Came here to look for a heavy coat to bring with me to Germany over the winter and didn't want to spend too much money since I'd never really have a reason to wear it again living in hot ole Arizona.  I had been searching on Amazon for jackets and couldn't really find anything for less than $300.  On our way home from Flagstaff, we dropped by and decided to check out the store.  They had plenty of stuff in there and I found a jacket that I liked but didn't know how warm it would keep me.  One of the sales reps there came over and went into detail about all the "perks" that the jacket came with.  I thought that was really nice.  I ended up buying the jacket - it was tagged at $140 but at check out, there yet another discount applied so it came out to $109.  What a deal!!

This place is a hidden gem, although I think it's going to get popular real soon.  Note to all people trying to find this place, it's a permanent FOOD TRUCK where you sit under a tent.  Don't go looking for a brick and mortar restaurant because you'll never find it.    Delish:  Nogales Dog with everything, asada burrito, and nachos.    Order from the guy that's usually there, grab your drinks out of the ice chest, wander over to the white cooler filled with toppings then have a seat and wait for them to bring your food.  You pay after you are done.  Love this place!

Came here to just pick up a lunch for our son who wanted their clam chowder.  The place was clean but not busy at all.  We were greeted very nicely.  We ordered the kids meal which came with a cup of soup, a cup of fruit (grapes & mandarin oranges) and we were able to pick between a chocolate covered strawberry or a slice of bread to go with the soup.  Of course the little man chose the strawberry.  It also came with a small drink, too.  Their clam chowder, I tasted, was pretty good - nice amount of clams in there.  I'd definitely come back to try out their 'adult" meals of sandwiches and salads.  The only odd thing was that they must have been overstaffed - as there were about 6 employees sitting in a booth and table right by the soda machine eating and hanging out.

I would've given this place 5 stars if they did not forget about my husbands entree.  But he did truly try to make it up to us, so we're happy with that. I just didn't like that his reason wasn't truthful.  Hubs ordered the lamb, I ordered the NY Strip, son ordered the cheese pizza.  We started off with the Schreiner sausage and Pork Belly with polenta appetizer.  It was amazing.  The glaze and apples on the pork belly gave it such a flavorful twist.  I loved every bite.  My entree and my sons came out shortly after that.  We were told that hubs meal was on his way.  A couple moments later, the server came back and asked what the hubs ordered, to which he replied, the lamb.  Okay, so this clearly meant he forgot to put my hubs order in, right?  Why would he come back to ask again what he ordered?  For the next 25 minutes, the server came out about 5 times to let us know that his dish would be out shortly.  The server comp'd a beer for him for his patience.  Came out later and said the Chef messed up his lamb the first time and was trying to perfect it for him the 2nd time and that's why it's taking so long - this is when I knew it was a lie because if that were the case, he should've told us that instead of coming out and asking what he ordered.  Finally when I was practically done with my meal, his lamb came out.  Hubs said he was so hungry that even if the lamb was not good, he would still think it was great.  Our server also comp'd us dessert for the trouble (and because we were celebrating our anniversary) - which was a warm chocolate bread pudding with vanilla sauce and berries.  We gobbled that thing up - it was incredibly tasty - warm, moist and flavorful.  Tommy, the server, definitely was great, he was attentive and friendly - it just made me irritated that he just couldn't be honest in saying that he forgot to put our order in instead of saying the Chef messed up.  We would've been fine either way.    We'll definitely come back to this place.  But yes, I gave it 1 less star for lack of honesty even though we had good service and great food.  Oh, and there was bread?  We weren't offered any...

I love Pei Wei for their Mild Dan Dan Noodles with ground chicken and no bean sprouts.  It is so good and I can eat it every day if I could.  I almost always order take out, so their online ordering is very convenient for me.  I order, work for a bit, then head out, park in the "To-Go" parking spots, run in, bypass the eat-in diner line, grab my bag and I'm out the door.  I've never had a bad lunch there.  Their honey seared chicken and shrimp over a bed of rice is also pretty good.  Love this place.  People can call it the "white man" Chinese food all they want but I sure as heck love it.

This place is fantastic!  All their sections are color coordinated.  The prices are low and they have friendly employees there.  Is the quality good?  So far so good for me.  It works for when I want to dress up an outfit a bit or look really accessorized.  Their purses are really cute there, too, though I have yet to purchase one.  I also purchased a fascinator hat there for a tea party I went to and everyone loved my hat.  I'd definitely shop here when I need to dress up an outfit that I'm wearing. I just really love that they color coordinate the store.  It makes it so much easier to find what I'm looking for.

This place is amazing.  Friendly service, consistent and always worth the wait.  They are always coming out with new flavors and happy to give us samples as we are waiting or trying to decide what we want.  This is as close to Hawaii as we can get.  Kevin and his staff are always happy.  My favorite is ice cream with POG topped off with snow caps.  They also cater, too!

I came here yesterday twice.  Once for lunch with my friend.  We each had their meatballs with a side of garlic bread.  They were 2 large meatballs for $6. The garlic bread, which I thought was overpriced was $2.50 for 2 slices.  The meatballs were really good - it was juicy and definitely made me full for lunch.  For 2 orders of the meatballs, garlic bread and we each had iced tea, our bill, before tip was $21.    I later came that evening for the Yelp Elite Event.  We were served Sangria and little mini cupcakes.  The sangria was great - and the mini cupcakes were delish!  Not dry at all and moist and tasty.  Very friendly people.

This place is awesome!  Super duper friendly and quick service.  I usually get my Chai Vanilla Latte at Starbucks but since there wasn't around (shocker) I pulled into Dutch Brothers.  Can I just say, "Good bye, Starbucks, HELLO Dutch Brothers!"  Their chai BLOWS starbucks away.  I can't want to come back and try out their other drinks.  I heard they have one that's made out of chocolate milk. Yes, please.

We really enjoy this place, but it seems like there's some kind of secret stuff you can order (kinda like In N Out) that we don't know about...because when I see my friends pictures of their Snoh, it's nothing I've seen on the menu.  Nonetheless, what I get is surely delicious.  I usually order the taro snoh with coconut mochi and sweet cream.  I have recently learned that if you order it "here" on a plate, you get more for just about the same price instead of in the cup.  Not much seating area in this place, so best to just eat on the go.

This place just opened last week and apparently they didn't do any advertising and just did a soft opening.  I came in for a manicure with gelish nail polish.  The place is hip and fresh and new - of course, since it just opened.  The service is nice, it's still too new to judge anything, but I think it will do well.  It's been a week and my gelish nail polish is chip-free! They currently have a 50% off special right now but not sure how long it will last. Check it out.

This is a happenin' place! I often feel rushed when I get in line to order because they have a person carrying a notepad or something taking our order as we stand in line, so I don't really get to peruse the menu to see what I want - an option is to get out of line to read the menu, but considering how busy it is, you need to stand in line, get your order and hope to get a table to sit at.  I'm not a HUGE hot dog fan, so I usually just order the "hot dog". It comes with everything including: mustard, relish, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickle and sport peppers piled onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.  The best part is the poppy seed bun. So soft and warm!  They also have crinkle fries that are also really good.  I'd definitely keep coming back to this place as there are many other things on the menu that I want to try.

I've only been here once.  Our server was not very good.  We already had waited 10 minutes with no one greeting the 3 of us at the table....the table next to us not only had an attentive server, but the manager stopped by a couple of times to see how they were doing and to bring out their entree's.  We agreed that we'd wait 2 more minutes before getting up and leaving.  After making eye contact with quite a few servers and bussers, as we were about to get up, our server came - without an apology, she asked what she could get us to drink.  We obliged and ordered.  After another 10 minutes, our drinks came.    For food, I ordered the beef shoulder that had a great presentation but it was a bit heavy.  I wasn't able to finish it.  My brother had the duck breast, and though I don't eat duck, he insisted I try it - it was better than my beef shoulder.  My SIL ordered the same thing I did, so nothing extra to comment on that.  The service throughout our meal was yet again, next to none.  We had to ask every time we wanted our drinks refilled - she never came by to ask how our meal was.  And when we did ask for refills, we actually felt bad because she made it seem like we were inconveniencing her.    You know how it goes....whenever you receive bad service, it's almost hard for the food to taste good - you're just so bothered by the service that it doesn't matter.  To the point you just don't want to eat anymore.  I was really excited because we finally had a "trendy" restaurant in our area besides all the corporate (Olive Garden, Oreganos, etc.)  restaurants, but it looks like this one isn't a winner.

Not really a fan. The mongolian beef was blah.  The meat was tough and some parts were crunchy.  The meat is very cheap quality.  Definitely not the same meat that's pictured on their display.  The rice was a bit raw in some of my bites. And overall they drowned my rice in the sauce.  I forced myself to eat half of it.  It's also pretty expensive.  $12 for my rice bowl, soda and 2 small eggrolls.  I would not come back again.

This place is the BOM(boba)!  It's in West Phoenix but it's closer than me going to the East side to get my boba fix.  The only time I actually go here is when I'm grocery shopping at Lee Lee's next door.  Service at this place has always been very friendly.    I ordered the volcano with boba - it was a bit too sweet for me. So I always stick with my usual Taro Slush with Boba.  So good - the best I've had anywhere in this state.  They also have the buy 5 cards so utilize those if you are going to become a regular.

My son is now into lesson #6 of the Bully Proof - Little Champs program.  I was apprehensive at first because I didn't know how my 5 YO would react to the program.  I also didn't know what to expect either.  But my son loves it and so do I.  Mr. Val & Mr. Adam are patient, fun yet stern with the kids.  They teach them how to speak up, have a voice.  They teach them how to be confident and disciplined.  They teach them how to defend themselves.  All the characteristics that I was looking for my son.  I was also worried because my son has a short attention span and didn't know how he'd do in a class of 10+ kids.  But I was assured that this was normal behavior and that in time, he'll be more focused. This is just all new to him.  I am happy we signed him up and look forward to seeing this young little boy turn into a confident little man!

Hubs and I always tend to favor this place when we are at Desert Ridge over all the other many restaurants in the area.  On the occasion, we'll get a pizza at Slices, but overall, we're generally at Nori.  We always order tha jjam-pong noodle dish which consists of ramen noodles, mussels, scallops, calamari, shrimp, red & green bell peppers.  The broth is flavorful and the ramen noodles perfectly al dente.  They also have great sushi - but my favorite is the california hand roll.  Not the sushi roll, but the hand roll.  Service there has always been great and we enjoy eating out on the patio during cooler weather.

Finally a breakfast joint by our house.  Service here is really good and they are friendly.  You also get 1 free refill on your freshly squeezed orange juice.  How cool is that?  Their omelets are great - and homefries are delish - ask for them to be cooked crunchy/crispy.  Their steak and eggs were not very good - the steak was well done and chewy.  I definitely am a repeat customer.

I like going to this place for their ramen.  There aren't that many places around us that serve ramen and when I have my craving, this is where we go.  If we are there during happy hour, we also order a few sushi rolls, which there are none that we have not liked.  Service is really friendly and there's always a table ready for us when we arrive.  I definitely recommend this place.

This place apparently opened a little over a month ago.  The people are friendly but barely speak any English.  Husband had the pho dac biet - it was alright, he said.  I had the com thit nuong - the porkchop was pretty decent, but the rice was definitely old and microwaved (I also could hear them using the microwave in the back).   I ordered a small bowl of pho tai gan sach for the boy, and there was ONE sach (tripe) in the bowl.   Others below have said their pho is delicious but then go on to say they ordered the "seafood" one...I'm sorry, but if there is seafood in your pho, you are NOT ordering pho - that's more of either their "mi" dish or their "hu tieu" dish...true pho does not have seafood in it.  With that said, I was hoping this place would be really good since it's so close to my house, but unfortunately, I will probably not be coming back to this place again, nor do I think this place will be open for much longer either.  Back to Viet Kitchen I go...

I've been to this car wash a few times.  The service has always been great!  It's $7.99 and the machines inside are new and they clean my car very well.  This most recent time, we had just gotten back from a long road trip so I wanted to wash my car from all the dust, bugs and general grime from the trip.  The guy running the station at the time noticed that I had a lot of bugs on my front bumper and told me that if I went through once and noticed bugs still on the bumper to come back around again.  I did do that as a good majority of them came off but not all.  He was extremely friendly and I thanked him for allowing me to go through a 2nd time, his response was, "We're here to make you happy."  I thought that was great customer service.

I wish this place was closer to my house.  Service is great and drinks are great.  I had the milk tea with pudding and also got the taro milk tea with pudding for later.  Both were great!  We came back to buy one more drink for the hubs but their credit machine was down and they didn't tell us until it was time to pay - we only had $2 on us, so they took that instead of charging the full $4 and change.  That was nice.  They have a bunch of different flavors that we'll have to come back and try another time we're in the neighborhood.

Love this place! The italian ice tastes exactly like it's description.  The toddler loves the Starburst Strawberry flavor the most.  I love getting a mix of the vanilla frozen custard with the cherry italian ice. They also have a mobile app you can download for free and you can scan each visit and on the 10th one, it's free!  Also, don't be shy to ask to sample any of the flavors. They are really nice about it.

Ugh. Our pho looks like the broth was scooped off the top layer because it was filled with fat.  The service was just as bad - they kept bringing out the wrong food and drinks.  There was a female server there that didn't even speak a word and kept bringing out food and placing it at one end of the table and walking off without trying to figure out who it belonged to our telling us what it was.  One pho dish we asked for them to cook their normally rare meat all the way before serving it as the person was pregnant and couldn't risk eating anything remotely raw - but it still came out with half of the meat cooked and the other half raw.  I definitely would not come here again.

I came here with my co-workers and have always wanted to try this place out.  With so many hamburger shops opening up every where, I was a little leery if this was as great as I have heard.  After ordering at the counter, we received a pager that would go off once our food was ready.  They have a "chili" bar with all kinds of different chili/peppers along with your normal ketchup and mustard pump stations.  I ordered their regular hamburger meal that came with fries and a drink which was $6.99 plus tax.  I was impressed!  The fries were hot and crunchy and perfectly cooked.  Hamburger wasn't out of this world, but was tasty.  I'd come back.

Came here the Friday before Labor Day weekend at 3pm.  The wait time was about 25 minutes.  I had candy crush to keep me busy while waiting in line.  When it was my turn, it was pretty quick.  The guys are very friendly and nice.  You can either wait in one of their booths or sit in the passenger seat while they run the test.  It's just annoying to know you have to pay $27 for some 2 second check they do on your gas tank.

Upon entering Outback Steakhouse, I was giving a little "bingo" game to be completed in order to win a really cool basket full of goodies - unfortunately, I didn't win, but that's okay!  I was seated with a great group of people at one of the booths.  We were able to sample many food items like flatbreads, onion blossoms, coconut shrimp, nachos, mushrooms and plenty others. I have to say, the coconut shrimp was probably my least favorite.  My favorite were the 2 flatbreads that were brought out.  They were tasty, crunchy and very flavorful.  The service there was great - they were very prompt, friendly and attentive.  We also were served 2 alcoholic beverages - I opted for 2 glasses of their moscato wine which I probably could have drank the whole bottle if given the option.  It was delish!    Thank you again for a great event, Lindsey!

Closed on Sundays.  This place has super friendly service.  I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and though it was good, the taste of bamboo shoots was strong.  The hubs had their spicy pork bento box and he enjoyed it very much.    We've been here a few times and the menu and restaurant layout has changed almost every time we've been there.  Hope this place is here to stay though.

I'm ready to write about this fantastic place.  I've eaten here about 4-5 times now and every time, I like it more.  My new favorite dish is the pad see ew with shrimp.  I am a wuss so I always order it at a 1 spice level.  The first time we came, they were about to close, unbeknownst to us, but they insisted that we come in to eat.  That, within itself was rare and extremely kind of them to do so.  That won us over.  Their Thai iced tea is delicious, their eggrolls are crunchy and tasty.  The server/manager is friendly and prompt.  My husband and brother chat with him every time we are there and we learn something new with each visit.  We have definitely chosen this place over Pete's Thai (down the street) by a landslide.  So happy that it's here and we hope that it stays!  Support your local restaurants!

Never ever again Clever Koi. Never. Ambiance was very hipster with loud music.  That's fine.  Service? Meh.  The hubs and I took my parents here for dinner to celebrate my mothers health.  We waited about 25 minutes for our table - even though there were other tables sitting empty.    My mom and I ordered the seafood hot pot. Okay when you think hot pot, you think of those pots where you throw in a bunch of veggies, seafood, meat, what have you - never did I think that it meant it was SPICY HOT.  We had started off with our unimpressive appeitzer of the catfish/scallop/shrimp dumplings with "nuoc cham" which is basically fish sauce.  The four dumplings were about the size of a quarter and sat inside a HUGE bowl filled with fish sauce.  For $8, I'd say that's a hefty rip off.  We all literally leaned in towards the table to look inside the giant bowl at our dumplings.  Next up we ordered the wood grilled octopus/sea weed/xo aioli sauce - BLAH.  All bun, no octopus.  We also tried the peking duck/house bacon/mizuna/charred plum jam - that was just meh.  Ugh so disappointing, at yet another $4/bun.    My mom's SPICY seafood udon bowl came out - it was too spicy so she gave it to my dad.  And he ate it.  Said it was decent.  We sat there and watched him eat.....eat.....eat....eat....and then he was done.....and we sat there and looked at his empty bowl as our bowls had still yet to come out.  I don't get it, we ordered 2 of the same bowls - at least the 2nd one should have come out?  The hostess came to clear my dads bowl - I told her we still hadn't gotten ours yet, she kinda apologized and walked off.  About 15 minutes later, the 2nd udon bowl came out and one of the pork ramen bowls came out.  So I told my mom and hubs to eat.  As I sat there and watched them eat.....and eat.....and eat.  Towards their last few bites, my pork ramen bowl came out - the server, or maybe it was the manager came out to deliver it to me and apologized for the delay of the entire meal and said this bowl was on the house.  That was a nice gesture - but considering the circumstances, all our bowls should have been comp'd.  My mom and I couldn't finish our pork bowls - it was so extremely salty - the "broth" was so dark it tasted and looked like it was sitting in a bowl of soy sauce.    After my 1 comp'd ramen bowl, our bill still came out to over $80.  I'm all for fusion food - but this was just ridiculous.

I'm a fan!  I was a bit leery about making my own pizza subway-style but as I chose all my toppings that I wanted on my pizza, I sat and waited.  They called out my name and the pizza looked impressive.  It was more of a thin-crust pizza and when I took a bite, I was won over!  My pizza tasted just the way I had hoped.  I will definitely be coming back again as this place is literally blocks from my work.

Love this place and have never ordered something I did not like.  I have to admit, I'm a plain Jane and LOVE their madagascar vanilla shake with whipped cream.  Hubs and the little man always have to order a pint of the basil lime sorbet to take home on top of eating a single scoop while we're there.  Staff is friendly and always very helpful.  So glad they opened this location since it's closer to our house.

Came with my SIL for some quality girl time.  It was fun and we enjoyed this place.  We both had males do both our manicures and pedicures.  The males were friendly, funny and didn't talk crap to each in Vietnamese while they were servicing us (as you normally would see at a large majority of nail shops).  They always made sure we were comfortable.  Our nails came out looking great.    The only complaint I had was that we both had the same exact services, but I was charged $5 more than my SIL.  I don't know why and didn't know this until after we had already left.

I've always had pleasant experiences with Discount Tires.  They check and fill my tires with air for free - some places will accept my tip of a couple of dollars, other locations will not.    After doing some research on tires (Costco was more expensive amongst other places) I made an appointment several days ago online to have 2 of my front tires replaced.  The next day I received a call from a rep at DT advising me that they didn't have my tires that I wanted in stock, but it was no problem ordering them for me and it'd be there by the time my appointment arrived.    I came at my allotted time and was greeted immediately upon entering.  I don't remember my reps name but he was friendly and courteous.  He did try to upsell me a few times on things including new tires for my back end but I declined.  I can't be annoyed by that as it's part of their job.  At the end, I ended up paying what was quoted to me when I did my online appointment.  He told me since I made an appointment, it would take them 45 minutes to complete the job.  Out of curiosity and boredom, I decided to time it and see if it really would be 45 minutes.  To my pleasant surprise, it was done in less than 37 minutes.  The guy who checked me out was also very friendly.   If you are tight on time, I would suggest to make an appointment through their website  because they are true to keeping your appointment and getting you out before others who did not have one.  Friendly guys, knowledgeable, professional and they all seem genuinley happy.

This place is great!  The concept is just like Chipotle or Subway.  Pick your pie or make one of the suggested ones on the menu.  The pizza is so good! I always order a pizza with mozzarella and fresh mozzarella with pepperoni, mushrooms, garlic, and light onions.  The staff is friendly and the pizza gets baked in their oven. Since it is thin crust, it doesn't take long to bake at all.  It's $7.95 which I think is a great deal for a personal size pizza.  They also have salads there, too.

Cute little place inside the Union Market at the Biltmore.  Staff is super friendly.  I ordered the hand cut pasta with pork jus - simply delicious with a hint of citrus in there (or was it just me).  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the pork jus was light and flavorful.  I would definitely order that again.  Hubs ordered the Fat Boy pizza (bacon, sausage, pickled peppers, red onion, cream) $17 added a poached egg on top (extra $2).  He enjoyed it but I'm not a fan of the pickled peppers.  My brother and his wife shared the Mushroom pizza (house made sausage, red onion, garlic, thyme) $16 added a poached egg on top (extra $2).  Their's was pretty bomb.  We also ordered the Crispy Cheese Curds in a simmered tomato sauce $8.  Very good.  Also ordered the Oven Baked Eggs (2 eggs, sausage, mushroom, pepper, onion) $12.  That was good, if you were able to get some of the egg yolk on it.  Yum just thinking about it.

This place fills my cravings for when I am craving Boiling Crab or Kickin' Crab in California.  The food tastes great but it can get a bit pricey.    I usually order 1 lb. clams, trifecta, mild (#1 level spice) $12/lb. and 1 lb. of shrimp, trifecta, mild (#1 level spice) $10/lb.    The clams are pretty good, but the shell itself is really thick and heavy so you really don't get a lot of clams for 1 lb.    The shrimps are quite large and so tasty with the trifecta sauce.  The do come out super hot, so I always burn my little fingers when I try to peel the shrimp.  Come knowing you're hands will get dirty!  This location also has BBQ.  I tried it before and it's not too bad, but the seafood is why you should come here!

My first mattress as a "grown adult" (as in I purchased myself and not my parents) was a Heavenly Bed from the Starwood brand hotels (the Westin Heavenly Bed). It certainly was heavenly and we kept that mattress for about 9 years!  But as time went on, the mattress got old from wear and tear and a few accidents made by our son and our puppy back in the days.  We had shopped for a mattress for quite some time, but the ones we wanted were so dang expensive - so we kept holding off and tried to justify it by saying, well the mattress is still sleep-able.  But in reality, it wasn't.  It was getting lumpy - our (hubs and I) backs were beginning to hurt from sleeping on it and it just, well, wasn't heavenly anymore.    We continued to shop around and decided to take our chance with Tuft & Needle.  A "local" company that seemed to take pride in their product.  The best part was that it wasn't cleaning out our bank!  We decided to give it a shot.  When the hubs brought the box home, I admit, I was a little concerned.  It came in a LONG rectangle box.  My first thought was, uhhh is this a futon type of mattress?  Because that's certainly not what I saw on their website.  How does a THICK, SQUARE mattress fit in a long rectangle one?  When we opened the box up, my worst fears came about, IT IS a futon type mattress!  It was rolled up!  What the heck, right?   Hubs said just to lay it out and we'll see how it looks.  To my surprise, as we continued to unroll the mattress and place it on our box-spring, the mattress rose to 10-inches as advertised.    To make this long review short - it's been about 3 months now and we could not be happier with our decision.  The mattress is soft yet firm.  It's comfortable.  It's cozy and we've never slept better.  So long are our days of purchasing super expensive brand name mattresses.  Moving forward, we're purchasing here for all our future mattress needs.  AND, they have a 7-year warranty!!

Disclaimer: I was invited to come have lunch compliments of Thirsty Lion.   Upon arriving, we were greeted by the hostess who was very friendly.  She and another hostess debated on where to seat us - and the 1st hostess suggested a low top since my guest was quite short.  I'm glad she noticed. :)    Our server approached shortly after, and I am so mad I forgot her name, but she was courteous, friendly and knew her stuff.  We started off with the calamari and the bbq bacon wrapped prawns.  Both were delicious and the prawns were quite large and meaty.  Ashley, the event coordinator also stopped by to introduce herself - she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu.   For entrees, I ordered the pork cubano - I have to admit, this was my least favorite dish of the 3 that we ordered.  There were 2 types of meat in there and one of them was just not hitting my taste buds right. I actually couldn't finish it.  The fries that came with it were delicious though.  Perfectly crunchy.  Another person at our table ordered the filet mignon over mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The filet was perfectly cooked at medium rare and tasted divine.  The texture was great.  And the 3rd person at our table had the salmon risotto - that was hands down, the favorite of the table.  It was creamy and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  I'd definitely order that dish again.    For dessert, though full, our server suggested the blackberry cobbler with a scoop of ice cream on top.  It was great and the 3 of us shared it.  Without the sweetness of the ice cream, it would have been a bit tart, but with the ice cream, made it perfect.   Overall, our experience was wonderful.  Extremely friendly staff, food presentation was impressive and food was great (minus the cubano...sorry!).    Thank you for having us and we will definitely be back to try out other menu items.

I found this company on YELP and decided to book an appointment on their website for them to come out to my house to repair my cracked iphone 6 screen.  They were very responsive with me via text and kept me up to date on their ETA and when they actually arrived.  Isaiah was my tech and he was very friendly from beginning to end.  He replaced my screen in less than 30 minutes.  I took advantage of the Yelp deal and the cost to repair was $90.  I'd definitely use them again and would refer my family and friends to them.  Thanks!

This place is located in a small strip mall right off of University & Rural Rd.  The inside is very modern and geared towards students.  Service there is really great, and the Korean food is actually on par.  The only complaint is that their ban chan selection is pretty mediocre.  Usually at Korean restaurants you receive a plethora of ban chan, but here, you only receive 3. They have no problem refilling the ban chan for you though...and I didn't pay attention, but I think it's at no additional charge.  They have a combo meal there that I love which you get a choice of a meat/fish and a hot pot of tofu soup. It fills me up every time!  If I lived closer, I'd frequent this place more often and try their sushi.

I'm in trouble because this place just opened up less than 2 miles from my house.  This place used to be the old Luu's Chicken Bowl. The donuts are fresh, light and perfectly sweet!  My favorite so far is the good ole' powdered donut.  There's also another one that has some kind of cream inside while powdered on the outside.  The place just opened last week so obviously they have some kinks to work out.    Oh but one negative thing I have to say is how the owners family was there on one of the opening days, and one of the older gentleman (possibly owners father) was lounging on the couch and took his shoes off and put his BARE feet on top of the coffee table. I was so grossed out.

Had brunch here with my girlfriends over the weekend.  It was a perfect Sunday so we sat outside.  Our server was very friendly.  I ordered the cuban po boy sandwich with a side of gumbo.  The cuban was delish and paired perfectly with the mustard and pickles.  I enjoyed every bite!!  The gumbo was also very tasty.  We also ordered some beignets to share and they were perfectly fluffy, warm and chewy.  There was an overkill of the powdered sugar, but we aren't complaining!! There are several other items on the menu that I definitely wanted to try so this just means that we need to come back again.
