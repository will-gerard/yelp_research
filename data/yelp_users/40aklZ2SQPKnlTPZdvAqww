First the good news: The location just south of the canal on Scottsdale Road at Camelback is terrific. The interior is cool/chic.   That's about it.   Now the bad news.   First: the beer. They advertised that they had Sedona Brewery beer, but when I asked the server, he said, "we don't have it yet". If you don't have it, don't advertise it. (Side note - Sedona is brewing some really fine beers these days.)  Next: the food: sliders. Although the menu makes it appear that there is a wide variety of sliders, my experience and tastebuds say, "nope."   I had the lamb and the buffalo sliders, and an order of sweet potato tots.  Lamb: boring and poorly seasoned. (How do you make lamb boring?) Buffalo: boring and poorly seasoned. (Tasted just like the lamb, which was like hamburger. Whoop-ti-freaking-doo.) Sweet Potato tots: boring and poorly seasoned. The texture was nice, though.  Finally: the price. Six bucks per slider. (Did I mention this a 3 ounce slider.) Seriously? I can go to Delux and get a half pound Delux Burger for 9 bucks. It tastes like heaven, the atmosphere is just as chic as Stax and they don't advertise beer they don't have. Why would I eat a six dollar slider that tastes like In-n-Out?  I guess this is a place you go when you're already a little lit up and want to hang with the beautiful people and don't care what the food tastes like because you are more interested in being perceived as hip and happenin'.  Avoid it if good food means anything to you.

Atmostphere: None. Service: Counter service. Friendly, in a swedish kinda way. Food: Ok - I had the chicken wrap.  It took 30 minutes to get a chicken wrap. 30 minutes. And it was not crowded. It tasted pretty good. I assume it took 30 minutes because they were waiting for the chicken to mature enough to slaughter it, butcher it, dress it and cook it to put in my wrap.  30 minutes for a chicken wrap? Really?

Caroline & I had breakfast at BLD in Chandler yesterday (NE corner of Dobson and Germann) and were quite pleased. As those of you know us know, we don't eat out much because Caroline's cooking is so much better. But we keep trying to find places to love. BLD may be one of those places.   We were greeted at the door by the hostess with beautiful eyes and a fabulous smile. A small touch, but it immediately made us feel welcome. So many stores get this first, simple step so very wrong. BLD got it right.  The atmosphere is good - kind of a warm, modern Chipotle-ish interior - not schlock-country or faux-dining room like so many breakfast joints. But of course the main reason for being there was the food.  The menu is simple and not overwhelming. A large enough list of choices without being too many. I liked that. (Often, restaurants with huge selections are not great at anything. Better to be narrow and deep than broad but shallow.)  The service was courteous but not intrusive. We took some time making our selection and the waitress gave us that time without giving us attitude. Thank you. Caroline selected the Spanish omelette and I chose the vegetarian.   Both omelettes were served with potatoes that were actually very, very good. So often, breakfast potatoes are either too salty, too raw, too bland, too soft, or just too much. These were just right. Again, thank you.  Both omelettes were distinctive and tasty. My vegetarian omelette was bursting with good vegetable flavors - portobella mushrooms, bell peppers, tomatoes, onions - and was well seasoned. I enjoyed eating every bite of it, except for the bite I shared with Caroline. Her's was much more a meat-flavored dish, and was savory without being too much.  My coffee was terrific. I don't know why so many places get coffee wrong when it is so easy to get it right. BLD got the coffee right. They also offer coffee-bar drinks. Caroline had the cafe' breve and it was very nice. Of course, if you start with good espresso, it makes everything else fall in line.  Brent, the GM, dropped by our table and chatted a while with us. He told us that both he and the three owners all live within a couple of miles of the restaurant. What a pleasure to be able to support local businesses and to be rewarded with good food, good service and a good experience.  Good job, BLD. Check it out.

In our continuing quest to identify cool, locally owned places to eat and/or drink, Caroline and I auditioned Vintage 95 last night.   Before I go further, understand that whenever I go out for eats or drinks, I have  in  mind a Platonic Ideal of the Bar/Pub/Eatery I most want to frequent. I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life.   Vintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...  The plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.  The location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]  The atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.  Caroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal "vodka martini extra dirty extra cold" which she judged to have "perfect dirtiness", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold.   The limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious.   Things being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us "you have to try the Vintage burger", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.  In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.  Like everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.  At this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.  We will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.

As with all our reviews, we rate Food, Atmosphere and Service.  Blue Hound nails it on all fronts.   The food is unique - I've never even seen most of these dishes on any other menu - and ranged from good to "Oh My Gawd This Is Amazing!" The bar is stocked with a terrific range of spirits with a particular emphasis on small batch American liquors.   The atmosphere is inviting with lots of comfortable seating and a good size bar to sit or stand around. The restaurant is located in the Palomar Hotel and - in keeping with the general vibe of an upscale/downtown hotel - has high ceilings, lots of wood and glass and a modern-but-not-too-trendy decor. It's a very nice place for a date or an evening with friends.   The service was terrific. We sat at the bar and our bartender Jesse, who was quite knowledgeable,  kept us hydrated without interjecting himself into our evening.   Cheyenne - who is, I believe, the Food & Beverage Manager - dropped by and talked with us, sharing her experience in the food industry in Phoenix. Cheyenne has been at Blue Hound since its opening and has a great sense of downtown Phoenix history of the hotel/restaurant industry. She's quite an asset to the Blue Hound.  We had the privilege of meeting Executive Chef Stephen Jones who personally delivered some of our menu items. This guy is good. He's created a menu that's a combo of southern-home cookin' "Comfort food with a grown-up flavor palate" and Asian fusion that doesn't exist anywhere else in the valley.  Chef Jones is a kind, generous and wonderful host who is quick with a smile and knows how to entice your adventurous side, delivering on all aspects of a dish. Food should taste as good as it looks and it does so here at Blue Hound.  Chef Jones does that and more; he's got a flair for the unexpected and a terrific flavor sense. Tater tots are not just simply Tater tots. Deviled Eggs are not simply eggs and Cheddar Biscuits are not just biscuits.    Downtown Phoenix needs more places like this to elevate the flavor palate environment in order to become a "go to" destination,  Blue Hound is doing it's part, others need to join.   The Food: if it seems like we ate a lot,  we did. We were treated to the very best Blue Hound has to offer, The food was exceptional.  We tried everything on the "Snacks" menu except the cheese plate and enjoyed it all. There's something here for every taste.  Shishito Peppers: This is a usually mild but sometimes hot small pepper, that's blistered and served in miso & sesame seeds and seasoned with sel gris. I abso-freaking-lutely loved these things. The texture and flavor are perfection in an appetizer. The Miso is exceptional and the sel gris (salt) is the finishing balanced touch done right.   Caramel Popcorn: This was actually pretty darned amazing. The menu says "butterscotch with ancho chile" which sounded a little iffy to me, but the execution was flawless. They call this endless which means if you are like me, you could eat about 8 pounds of this stuff. Very good.  Deviled Eggs: This one is surprising. It's "just" deviled eggs, but its garnished with brioche, smoked ham and dijon. The flavor is subtle and rich, and the eggs are so creamy it's criminal. This is another dish you could easily eat waaaaaay too much of.  Tater Tots: Chef Stephen nails it on this little dish. The texture of the tots is fabulous, and the upfront initial  flavor of potato and chive is oh so nice,  lets not forget bacon too.  These are tater tots for grown ups. You can use the dipping sauce that is served on the side but theses little babies don't need anything added. They are dangerous mouth popping snacks.   Potato Fries: French fries are one of those ubiquitous dishes that can be really boring. Not here. These are sliced in wedges, steak fry size, and perfectly fried and seasoned. The outside was crispy and the inside soft and creamy. Seasoned with aromatic rosemary and a very nice parmegiano-reggiano cheese, and served with a not-too-spicy aioli, its just another unique twist on what's normally an oh-so-common food.  Cheddar Scallion Biscuits: Oh My Gosh. Just try 'em. Trust me.  All we had on the "Farm & Garden" section of the menu was the Roasted Cauliflower, but in typical Chef Jones fashion, he puts a unique twist on it with pistachios, capers and currants. However, everything else on that section of the menu looks absolutely fabulous and we are eager to try it all.  The "Sea & Ocean" section of the menu looks very appetizing. We tried two dishes which pretty much blew our minds: First, the Bay Scallop Ceviche. Chef Jones said "It's not what you think" and he was 100% correct, it was uh-maz-ing! Second, the Jerk Cured Scottish Salmon: buttery and melt in your mouth. Both were utterly unique and ridiculously flavorful.  There's more on the menu, but there's just so much two people can eat in an evening.  We cannot wait to get back.

I really wanted to like this place, but it was a disappointment. Prices were OK, service was friendly but unacceptably slow, food was very disappointing.   We had two different crepes; the Grand Prix and the burro. The flavors of the burro - while definitely southwestern - were poorly balanced. The spices were front and center rather than being complimentary. The crepe itself was heavy and doughy rather than light. The Grand Prix was served with an egg sunny side up with grossly under cooked whites. The crepe was also heavy and doughy and the flavors were poorly balanced. Perhaps our expectations were out of line but 24 bucks for two coffees and 2 below average crepes just seems wrong. Sadly, we won't be back.

TL;DR: Excellent food, good atmosphere, service good but could improve. We've been to Nosh twice now, so I feel confident that our first two experiences are representative of a typical experience.   For starters, I had the Watermelon Chile Gazpacho. It's an interesting twist on gazpacho; a refreshing lite appetizer. The flavors are subtle and nicely balanced. I would've preferred a bit more chile oil heat, but that's not a criticism of the dish; I just tend to prefer more heat in my dishes than most people.  I ordered a traditional gin martini. It was made with "The Botanist" gin and was insanely good: smooth gin with a subtle juniper flavor, exactly the right amount of vermouth, served ice cold with a single blue cheese olive. Elegant, tasty and very, very dangerous. I can't wait to have another one.  The Charcuterie & Cheese Board was a pleasant surprise. It consisted of three different cheeses, (a gouda and two semi-soft goat cheeses), three sausages, (sopressata, capecola and chorizo), plus Chef Stacy's homemade baguettes, almonds and dried fruit. This style of appetizer is becoming more popular around town, but I have seldom seen it done this well. All three cheeses were interesting and flavorful and paired very well with the sausages. I'm really not a fan of sopressata, and this one did nothing to change my mind, but Caroline really enjoyed it. (Like the chile oil in the gazpacho, this is not a criticism, just a matter of personal taste.) What amazed me about the dish was the size of the serving: it was plenty of food for two people and would've made a sufficient appetizer for three people. I didn't expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I did. Very good.  The Pork Chop Calvados may have been the best pork chop I've ever eaten. "Subtle" is the key word on this dish. It was ridiculously moist and juicy and full of rich pork chop flavor, but the quality of the pork and the subtle complex flavors of the apple brandy cream sauce elevated this dish into the upper echelons of Chandler-area food. I normally try to eat my way through an entire menu before repeating anything, but I enjoyed this dish so much I am tempted to repeat it on my next trip to Nosh. It was that good.  Caroline raved about the lobster roll. I'm not a lobster roll fan, but I did taste the lobster; it was sweet and tender as fresh lobster should be. (I am amazed that we can get seafood this fresh in Arizona.) Her comments were that the meat was tender, succulent, sweet, fresh and not overcooked. The roll was grilled, buttered and served warm and absolutely stuffed with cold lobster; "the way it should be", according to my Boston-born-and-bred partner. The proportions between bread and lobster were right, but she would have preferred a less doughy roll. Not a criticism of the quality of the roll, just a preference for a different style of roll. Furthermore, she raved about the price: $21. She just paid $18 in Boston for a genuine Fanueil Hall lobster roll which wasn't as big and didn't taste any fresher. She said it was just as good as a real east coast lobster roll. High praise indeed.  She also had the Crab Salad  and commented that it was well seasoned, tasted fresh,  and was refreshing and light.   I've observed such a dearth of interesting desserts at most restaurants I frequent in Chandler that it made me suspect desserts were going out of style. But not at Nosh. Oh no.  If you ever doubted the existence of God, the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie should restore your faith. I fear if I fully express how deeply and passionately I loved this dessert you would think me slightly unhinged. Just trust me: if you order nothing else, go to Nosh for the Chocolate Bourbon Pecan Pie. If you don't like it, leave the rest for me. I will eat the leftovers, then lick the plate clean, then probably lick up whatever crumbs fell on the table and finally sniff whatever Pecan Pie aromas remain in the air until I am sated.  Yeah, it was pretty good.  Ginger Chili coffee: I've never seen anything like this on any menu anywhere. I'll try almost anything with chile in it, so I had to try this. It was fun, subtle, (there's that word again), interesting and - most surprising - refreshing.  Seriously, even though it was hot coffee, the ginger-chili combo my refreshed my palate and cleared my head like ice water on hot a day. It was amazing & unlike anything I've ever tried. Definitely worth a repeat.  Caroline had the Deconstructed Coffee. She enjoyed it. I was too busy orgasming over the pie and coffee to give it my full attention, but it looked really fun  The atmosphere is casual and intimate, the music not too loud. My only complaint is that our waiters during both visits were not as intimately acquainted with the details of the menu as I would have preferred. This is an area where Nosh can improve, but it's only a tiny complaint as otherwise the service was attentive without being intrusive.  Highly recommended.
