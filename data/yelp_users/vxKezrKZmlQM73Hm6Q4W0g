Always a good time. Stopped by here Saturday night to have a couple drinks before bar hopping in Phoenix!  Friendly staff, quick service, great time!

Delicious food! I always enjoy the food when I come to Texas Rd house. The service is usually hit or miss. Last nights experience was pretty good. For some reason they always serve the onions under cooked. My mother and I both got ours well done but my sister made the mistake of assuming they would be grilled correctly. Instead they came hard with that strong raw white onion flavor. She decided not to complain and just got a box togo for everything else. The rolls and butter are always to die for and the Caesar dressing it always on point. I don't want to detour people from going because overall I love this place.

Good Food, staff was friendly, maybe a little too friendly. One of the works asked how our meal was about 7 times. He was nice tho! Food came out quick and the jalapeno cheese was soooooo good so I am happy! Loved the free style coke machine too!

I had my 28th birthday here last week and it was awesome! I had about 20 friends show up. Unfortunately they do no take reservations, but I let them know a week before just to expect us. They were good about getting us in, it took about an hour which was expected for a Saturday night. The food was awesome, staff was friendly and I really had a great time! Four Peaks is one of my all time favorite places I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a great place to eat and drink delicious beer.

Bomb.Com as always!!! So good!! Went last night with a friend and we both made massive bowls. Enjoyed every bite. Even had a bite of the raspberry frozen yogurt which was delish. This place never disappoints. A little pricey ($12.50 per person) But worth it because it is so dang good! I definitely will be returning!

Great food, nice quick service!   Perfect spot for a nice low key lunch break! I had the club salad! Tasted great! Charged me $.50 for extra ranch which is a bit cheap in my opinion but at least the salad was good.   The gentleman next to me at the bar also asked for more dressing saying there wasn't enough which I agreed! Maybe they should be a little more generous with their dressings.

I invited about 25 people here on Saturday and had a blast! Good atmosphere, good drinks and everyone had a great time! I have friends who live within walking distance and it makes for a great safe night out. There aren't too many bars in Mesa so this is definitely a good find!

Love this place! Fantastic patio, great staff and on the occasion that the kitchen is a little backed up and taking a little longer the manager is there to make it right! I often come here with my family on a Sunday night and I would recommend it to anyone! The fajitas are to die for and I definitely recommend the coconut margarita! Yummy!!

The staff was nice, so that was a plus. However, I ordered the summer salad which was $13.00. When it came out it was tiny! The server asked if I wanted chicken so I said yes and that was $5.50. For 1 small chicken breast! The dressing was kind of bland tasted like oil. Overall I was not impressed. My bill with an Ice team came to about $25.50 for me by myself. I won't be going back! I left hungry and Broke.  :-(

One of my favorite restaurants around! Great wine atmosphere, service and food! There is not much more you can ask for in a restaurant! Also, the wine deals on Tuesday nights are fantastic the only problem is you have to get there early or you end up waiting forever because the place is so dang popular. A must visit if you are in the downtown gilbert area!

Love, love, love their Steak Salad! I use to work in old town and I would go there for lunch a couple times a week for that salad. I also loved the Yelp deals! I got a free appetizer just for checking it! And of course it is always a great time when you hit the town for a little country dancing in your high heels!

I ordered the protein bowl and asked for no coleslaw as I can't have mayo. I informed them I wanted just extra veggies and they said it was no problem. When it finally came out after about 15 mins it was on a bed of coleslaw. So I sent it back. It came out with coleslaw still stuck to the chicken on a bed of grilled veggies (some still frozen). My friend who was with our group of 6 didn't even get her meal after asking 3 different people for it. The manager finally brought it over and it was still wrong. They at least boxed it up and gave her a refund. Out of the 6 of us only 1 person liked their meal. I have to say I will not be returning.

Picked up some lunch Togo. We had 2 omelets and a country fried steak. All tasted great except. I asked for no hasbrowns in my big steak omelet. I can't have starches so I thought an omelet would be the perfect option. Unfortunately, it came with hash-browns inside. Even though I specified very clearly when placing the order I couldn't have hash browns. I did my best to scrape them out but was very disappointed.  I love Ihop and come very often with my family. I often choose not to go to this location because the service tends to struggle. I heard they are under new management so I am hoping it will improve. But so far I am not impressed. I thought if I got takeout I wouldn't have to worry. But it still managed to no be right.
