I've been doing business with Foto Forum for about 8 months now, and I've always gotten great customer service, and advice from the folks there.  Just recently, I had an experience that pleasantly surprised me.  I'd purchased a Promaster CF card from them in January.  I used it for a while, but then it got corrupted somehow.  I switched to another brand that I had on hand, and took the Promaster back to FF.  They exchanged it for another after verifying that it was a bad card with no problems.  I stuck the new one in my camera case and forgot about it until a couple weeks ago. (I may have formatted the new one in my camera, I don't remember at this point)  I pulled it out to use it for a firmware update, and found that neither my camera or computer would recognize it.  So, I took it back to FF.  They tried to format it in one of their cameras, and it wouldn't function for them either.  With no questions asked, they not only exchanged this CF card for a new one, but they also upgraded it to the new "Extreme" CF that Promaster makes.  In other words, they exchanged a $60 CF card for a $140 card without any hassle or paperwork.  That's the kind of customer service I really like.    One side comment:  The people behind the counter at FF are photo geeks (and I don't think they'd be offended by that) who happen to work in a camera shop.  Meaning they're incredibly knowledgable, and more than happy to help, but maybe not overwhelmingly polished and "salesman-like".  I've dealt with all of the gentlemen working there currently, and can't think of a single negative thing to say about any of them.  Regarding pricing:  I research everything I buy before I make a purchase.  I know that I can beat the prices at FF on many items by ordering online.  The difference is generally fairly small though, and I feel that it's worth the extra 1-2% to purchase locally, and have the access to such an incredible knowledge base that the folks at FF have to offer.

Stopped in here early on a Saturday morning to grab lunch, and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant was clean, and we were greeted by a friendly hostess as soon as we entered.  She was very helpful answering the few questions we had, and then we moved on to the ingredient bar.   All the ingredients looked very appetizing, and the vegetables were fresh and nicely sliced.   They really have a great selection of seasonings and sauces.   16 sauces in all, so you can mix and match to your hearts content and come up with some fun stuff!  The cooking area was very clean, and the cook prepared the food quickly and cooked it just right.  The vegetables were cooked, but still just a bit crisp, and all the meat tender.    There's plenty of brown or white rice to go with the entree as well.   Really a nice place to stop and eat.

I've been eating here for 15-16 years, on a weekly basis for most of that time.  It's the longest relationship I've ever had, and there's a reason for that.  The food is phenomenal!!    This is the quintessential hidden gem hole in the wall.   Dong A is a family owned and operated restaurant.  Everything is made fresh each day, from fresh ingredients.   Really, I've tried almost everything on the menu except for the catfish and the duck (not a fan of either).   NOTHING disappoints!!  Some of my biggest favorites:  #45  Beef cubes saut√©ed with garlic.    #59  Phat Tai.   Noodles, egg, chicken, shrimp and vegetables in dark soy gravy.    #30   Marinated Pork and Shrimp in special sauce, over rice.   WOW, Just WOW!!  and, the Beef Pho.  Just wholesome goodness!!  Remember, this is a "mom and pop", so sometimes service can be a tad slow if they're busy, but you'll get taken care of, and the food is so very worth it!

I've been to this location several times.   Once for a tuxedo fitting for an out of state wedding, which they did for free, and also to buy clothing.  I've had nothing but positive experiences.  I've dealt with Nathan and Bruce, who are both professionals at what they do, and were extremely helpful in helping me find, and get fitted for clothing.  The selection is fantastic, and quality of the clothing top rate.  If you need well priced, quality clothing, and want excellent customer service, I'd recommend this location.

I wouldn't use anyone else.  Pop-ins is my go-to any time I need cleaning done.  I've had them do move out cleanings and pre-move in cleanings for rental properties, and they have done a more thorough clean than any other company I've seen, at a reasonable price.   I have had them clean my own home, and the homes of family members.  They are exceeding accommodating, and their two priorities are making the customer happy, and doing the best job possible.  I can't say enough good things about Pop-ins, they really are the best in my opinion.

Stopped in on a whim because a friend mentioned this place. Liked it the minute I walked in.  Nice atmosphere, and friendly staff.  I had an espresso, a large coffee, and the chicken curry sandwich.  My 6 year old son had the grilled cheese.  The espresso was flavorful without being bitter, and the coffee full bodied.  The chicken curry was excellent, and the bread it was on was almost as much of a treat.  My son devoured the grilled cheese, which was also on the same multi grain bread as mine, though toasted,  We enjoyed hanging out in the courtyard behind the cafe, which has a fountain, and very relaxing atmosphere.  All in all, a very pleasant experience with very good, reasonably priced food.  I'll definitely be making this place a regular stop.

Excellent pizza!   Ordered a large Meat Lover for delivery.  The pizza arrived in about 30 minutes after ordering online.   The pizza was the best I've had in a long time.   The sauce was excellent, and all the toppings flavorful.  The crust was perfect!   I've definitely found my new favorite pizza place!

WOW!!  I called just to ask some simple questions about the center, and I can't believe how rudely I was treated!  Whoever the woman on the phone was cut me off abruptly, answered the couple questions I did manage to ask curtly and with hostility.  I'd NEVER take my kids to this place!   If they talk this way to adults, I can only imagine how they treat the children!

I'd driven by this place many times, and finally decided to stop in yesterday afternoon.  I walked in to a lively and raucous discussion among the 6-7 salesmen about a customer who'd just left.  She was, from what I gathered, a very attractive blonde woman, and drove a convertible BMW.  The employees were enthusiastically speculating about how much ejaculate she must have swallowed, and how many times she must have performed fellatio to afford such a car.  Despite the 20 years I spent as a construction worker, even I was appalled at some of the comments made.  What was even more disturbing was that the staff didn't seem to care that customers could, and did, hear their comments.  I spent about 8-10 minutes in the store, just enough time to do a quick scan of inventory and prices, and the conversation continued the entire time.  Plus, it wasn't until I was on my way out of the store that one of the employees asked if there was anything they could help me with.   Considering their brazenness, I have to assume that they talk about any and all females that enter their store in similarly derogatory terms.  Don't take your wives, daughters, girlfriends or any other female to this establishment.  Their prices and inventory are otherwise very reasonable, and under other circumstances, I probably would have purchased from them.

Unfortunately, I can't give them Zero stars, cause I'd like to.  I manage rental property.  A while back, a tenant called me and said the toilet was backing up into the shower.  I have plumbers I use regularly, but the tenant said she'd already called Plumbing Medic because she had a coupon.  The coupon was for snaking the sewer line, and inspecting it with a fiber optic camera for a total of $64.    I got there right after they finished snaking the line.  The line drained well at that point, so I asked if I could just pay them and they could leave. (We were waiting for the tech with the FO camera to get there.)  They told me if I DIDN'T let them do the fiber optic camera, they'd have to charge me $300+ for snaking the line.  So, I let them put the camera down the line.  Tech #1 is watching the monitor.  He puts the camera about 6 feet in, and says: "There's the problem." Me:  "What's wrong?" #1:  The line is starting to collapse.  (its only under about 2ft of dirt, so, doubtful) Tech #2 walks over:  "Oh, yeah, that's bad." Tech #1:  "Hey, (#2), is that..........oh, crap, what do you call it?  orange..........orange something?" Tech #2:   "Oh!  Orangeburg??  wow!! that's really bad!" Me:  "What's orangeburg?" Tech #1:   "its basically a petroleum impregnated paper tube.  It was really popular in the 50's because it was so cheap.  When was this house built?" Me:  "Mid 50's". Tech #2:   "Wow, we're going to have to replace the entire line!" Me:  "How much are we talking?" Tech #2:   "Well, you're looking at at least 30ft of digging, plus replacement..............probably about $1800, at least." Tech #1:  "I can write up the agreement and we can get started tomorrow." Me:  "I'll need to get a couple quotes before I can authorize that much expense.  Can you write it up and email it to me?" Tech #1:  "Sure thing."  They never emailed me anything.  My regular plumber went out later that day, and put his fiber optic camera in the exact same line.   Here's that phone conversation:  Me:  Hi Eric, so, what's wrong with that line? Eric:  Nothing. Me:  Isn't it collapsing?  They said it was Orangeburg, and it was collapsing. Eric:   No..........its PVC pipe, and nothing is collapsed.  There's nothing wrong with this line. Me:  Are you sure?  Eric:   Would you like me to email you some of these images? Me:  No, not necessary.   Could they have mistaken that PVC for Orangeburg?   Eric:  I don't see how.  That was 8 months ago.  There have been no further problems with the sewer line.

Epic has become one of the companies I depend on to keep my business running smoothly.  I've been using Epic for about 2 years, after they were referred to me by the AC company I've used for 15 years.     Epic has never disappointed me.   They handle repairs quickly, efficiently, and cost effectively.    I just had them do a job repairing a leak in a cast iron kitchen drain line in an older home.   They told me that they might need to jackhammer out some of the concrete floor to get to expose enough of the pipe to do the repair because the leak was right above the floor.  They told me it would be $850, minimum.   They called me the next day, with the job complete, and news that they had been able to make the repair without jackhammering, so the total cost was only going to be $600.  Considering how hard working with cast iron can be, that's really reasonable.   Epic plumbing does quality work, at reasonable prices.   They are available 24hrs for emergency calls, but they don't do routine repairs outside of normal business hours, which is understandable.  If you need them though, they will show up, and they'll do a good job for you.  I can't recommend Epic highly enough.

Really bad business.    I contacted Dave, the owner, and told him I needed to set up quarterly service for 2 properties.  I needed a clean up at one of them immediately because of HOA issues.  He took the addresses, said he'd take a look in the next couple days, and give me a quote.  After a week, I called him to ask where the quote was.  He said he'd been scheduled to go view the properties, but his truck broke down, but he'd get the quote the next day.  Another week goes by, no quote.  I called him, and he sent it to the wrong email address.  He finally sends it over.  I immediately reply with a go ahead, and he then replies that he'll get it on the schedule and let me know when it's done.   That was 2 months ago.  I've never heard back from him despite repeated calls, voicemails, and emails.  The job never got taken care of, and I finally found another landscaper to handle things.  Don't waste your time with this company.  They wasted my time, and left me hanging out to dry.

This place is amazing.  Went there for Sunday breakfast, and was absolutely blown away!!  EVERYTHING is custom crafted, and made to the highest standards.  Their regular lunch and dinner menus are equally good.  Wherever you are in the valley, this place is worth the drive!!!

I really can't say enough good things about Mug A Bug.  They're a small family owned business, and Sullivan's philosophy is simple:  Their Family is Serving Yours.  And the service you get is exceptional!!     I've used Mug A Bug at my own home for over a year, and what a difference they've made!  I had been getting service from (huge pest control company) for several years, but always had persistent problems with ants and ticks in my yard.  Since I began using Mug A Bug, those issues have stopped.    Keith Sullivan is fanatical.  He'll spend whatever time is needed to make sure the problem is dealt with.  He was at my home (horse property lot) for over 3 hours the first time he did a treatment.  And he treats the entire grass area of my yard (1/4 acre) at every visit.  Keith is also extremely knowledgable, and will educate, not upsell, you.    The other huge difference between Mug A Bug, when compared to (huge pest control company), is that Mug A Bug uses a truck mounted sprayer.    (huge pest control company) uses backpack sprayers that hold about 2 gallons.  Mug A Bug's truck mounted system allows them to put down as much pesticide is needed, and it works!!  I've also had Mug A Bug do treatments on rental properties I manage.  Rental properties often have significant problems with pests.   Mug A Bug's outstanding service has drastically reduced the number of pest issues I have to deal with.  In short, if you're looking for THE BEST pest control service in the West Valley, you need to call Mug A Bug.

I've known Mike Rogoz for several years, and he, and his company, have never let me down!  Mike's motto is "If a job is worth doing, it's worth doing right".  And that's what they do.  They get the job done right.  Everyone at Rogoz Electric is courteous, knowledgeable, and professional.  Their techs are polite and on time.     I've used them at my home, I've used them at rental properties, and I've referred them for major rewiring jobs.   They've never disappointed me with their service, and I know of no one who has a bad word to say about them.  Contractors often have a bad reputation for taking advantage of people.  That is one thing you won't have to worry about with Rogoz.    They deliver great service, at a fair price, without trying to upsell you, or exaggerating either the problem or the costs.    If you have lights in your house that randomly flicker,  or light switches that spark when you turn them on,  or outlets that don't work, or breakers that constantly trip,  Give Rogoz a call for an honest assessment of what the problem is.  Otherwise, your next call might be 911.

Tried this place out for the first time last night with a party of four adults and 3 children under 12.  Atmosphere was relaxed and casual, but everything was immaculately clean and the booth we were in was both large enough, and comfortable enough for all of us.  The service was Excellent!!  Our waiter, Patrick, was friendly, helpful and very attentive.  The rest of the wait staff I observed seemed to be equally outstanding.  We started off with an order of their pretzel appetizers, which were soft and chewy, just like giant pretzels should be.  They could have had a little more salt on them, but there was enough.    Then we ordered the House Special.  It was very good pizza, great flavor, and plenty of toppings.  Unfortunately, it took way too long to bring out (20 minutes, maybe 25), and the rim of crust was much too wide.  The wait I'll attribute to the fact that this is a newer restaurant, and it takes a while to get the kinks out of the kitchen process.  To give credit where due, this is when Patrick really stepped up, and made sure that we were comfortable while we waited.     Also, to Patrick's immense credit, he put the kid's meals orders in as appetizers, so their food came out very quickly, and while the adults waited, they were fed and happy.  So, I'd give this place a 3.5 on the food, but a solid 5 on service.    More importantly, I'd gladly go back the next time I'm in the area and hungry.

I've been a big fan of these guys ever since I discovered their food truck at Food Truck Friday a couple summers ago.  There's a reason why people would stand in line for 25 minutes for one of their dogs.  They're THAT good.    I was ecstatic to hear that the owners were finally fulfilling their dream of opening a sit down restaurant!  Thus, the Sit Stay Restaurant was born.  Everything that made Short Leash's food so good has carried over, and they've added even more!  The dogs are phenomenal!  Whether you go with one of the Menu items (Igby, Oliver, and Devil Dog are my favorites), or decide to build your own, you can't go wrong.  A couple other favorites:   Polka Dot Casserole, a gourmet twist on comfort food, and it is incredible!    And one I didn't see coming, the Fried Pickles!!  I didn't know what to expect, but I don't have the words to describe how amazing these are!!  You need to experience them for yourself.  There are plenty of other things on the menu to amaze you as well!  The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  The wait staff is super friendly, and the service is excellent!  You can't go wrong with Short Leash Hot Dogs, either the mobile version, or at Sit...Stay!!

Mamma Toledo is another phenomenal food truck who's made the jump from mobile to a store front, and I'm glad she did!!  Here's the thing with Mamma Toledo:  As cliche as it sounds, she's an artist, and her medium is pie crust and interesting, delicious things to fill them with.  I first encountered Mamma Toledo a couple summers ago, at Food Truck Friday.    All of her pies are made by HER, with one goal in mind:  To make the best pie she can.  And she does a damned good job.  My absolute favorite:  Chili Mango Pie.  Sweet tanginess that you can't stop eating!!  Her Key Lime Pie is actually KEY LIME pie!!  and it's the best I've had!!  (if you're a Dexter fan, you'll understand).  Rhubarb Pie.   If you've ever had real Rhubarb Pie, you know A) how good it is  B) how hard it is to find good Rhubarb Pie.     Mamma Toledo's Rhubarb Pie is every bit as good as my Grandmother's, that she made from the rhubarb that grew in her yard in up state New York.    Yes, it's THAT good.  But don't think those are the only good ones.  They're ALL good!!   Really, Mamma Toledo is one of those rare people who's been able to turn a passion into a business, and everything she makes is made with the goal of being the best pie you ever eat in mind.

Mitch Taylor, the owner of Bram Flooring, is one of the people I depend on to keep my customers happy.    I've used them a number of times to do tile, carpet, and even rebuild/retile an entire walk in shower.  Mitch's commitment to quality is second to none that I've encountered in the flooring business.   He wants happy customers, and goes the extra mile to ensure that the job is done right.  On a number of occasions, he's come in 25-30% under competitors' bids, and the material he put down was better quality.     Mitch, and Bram Flooring, have a simple philosophy.  They tell you what it'll take to get the job done right, let you decide which material grade fits in your budget, and then makes sure the work is done expertly.   No upselling, no hidden costs or last minute fees.     You simply get the best quality product, and installation, that you can get for your money.

Just Amazing!!  I stumbled upon this place a couple months ago, and it has become a regular stop for me!   To put it simply, you walk into an immaculately clean restaurant, order from some great people who actually act happy to see you, and get mind bogglingly good food!!  BEST fish tacos I've found in Phoenix!  Carne Asada that's out of this world!  Pork and Green Chilis that is absolutely amazing!  Really, the Phoenix Burrito House is just the best on so many levels!

I've ordered from Beijing Express several times.  They have not disappointed me.  The food is delicious, and deliver time was very reasonable.   This is a nice little family run place, and they take pride in their food.  I'll definitely be ordering from them again.
