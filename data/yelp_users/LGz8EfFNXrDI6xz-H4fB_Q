Hands down the best tacos in town!! The carne asada with flour tortillas are my favorite! Pastor are my second favorite.  If you feel adventurous I also recommend the tripa (crispy beef intestine). Seriously.   The tortillas are what really make the tacos. According to the owner, they import them directly from Mexico twice a week!  Don't forget the salsa bar and make sure to add some lime and green guac sauce with your favorite salsa to your tacos- the runny guac mixed with the lime and salsa will create an explosion of flavor in your mouth.   Paying at the end is a great convenience especially for a larger party or with new guests as you may not know how much you'll like these tacos until you take your first bite and you'll keep asking for more!

Fair try, overall service was just ok but this modern mexican cuisine leaves a lot to ask for. There was good and bad throughout. Salsa came out super cold and bland and did not complement the warm chips well at all.   Their version of guacamole is nothing more than mashed up avocados with lime and salt. We had to ask for extra pico, cilantro, jalapeños, and added salt and pepper and made our own guac with their ingredients.  We ordered the tacos, well done. I just wish you would give me a small lime wedge so we didn't have to bother the 'runner' yet again. The side of charro beans were a joke. Nothing more than boiled and dried up bland pinto beans, please pass the salt again or pass this place up altogether.

Stopped in here for a quick bite while in the area. I was immediately greeted by a very friendly cashier who took my order and made me feel at home with some small chit chat. The food was delicious, I has the ham sandwich; this masterpiece came loaded with many of my favorite ingredients: ham, cheddar, american, lettuce tomato, avocado, and just the right amount of pickled jalapeños. On the side I was served a ketchup bottle filled with a house chipotle dressing which took each bite to another level.   My melon agua fresca was made to order and was not loaded with sugar like others i've had. Food was great and their friendliness was just an added bonus! I am anxious to return and try some more!
