This is one of our favorite places to go!  The food is amazing and so is the service.  We went with a group of 11 people tonight at the tepid table and everyone loved their food.  In addition, the management is great.  We loved having Ricardo cook our food...so funny and entertaining.  We highly recommend it.  My neighbors said that the sushi is amazing.

Shelby provided our group of seven with exceptional service. We were visiting from out of town and loved the food. We will be back next time we're here.

I feel bad posting a negative review...because they are so nice here.  I was in town visiting family and brought my Golden Retriever in for a birthday grooming.  I explained to Tina that I wanted a 'summer cut.'   She brought the blades out and used a Sharpie to show me how long the hair would be.  I picked the longer one...explaining that the other one was too short.  I was shocked to see my dog when I picked him up...with the exception of his head/tail, he was almost bald.  I asked her what happened and she said that she decided to use the shorter blade because the other cut didn't look smooth.  This made no sense to me because I've taken him for many summer cuts.  I feel that if she was going to make changes to what we agreed on, she should have called me.  Once again, I feel bad for leaving a bad review, but my dog looks crazy and he's got many sores on his body after rubbing on the carpet, etc.  There was no hair to protect him.  In addition, I will need to keep him out of extended sun due to risk of sunburn.
