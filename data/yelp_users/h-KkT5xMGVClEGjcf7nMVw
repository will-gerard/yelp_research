Best bean & cheese burritos! I could seriously live off Rubios bean and cheese burritos. Rubios over Chipotle any day.

One of these days I'll remember that they are terrible and stop going. I told the guy vacuuming my car that it was recently broken into and there was some left over glass that needed to be vacuumed up. Once they were done I looked in my car and there was glass on my driver seat, floor board, and passenger seat. All if it was in plain view. Once I showed my receipt the guy left (it was a slow day, only 3 other cars there). As I'm looking around someone asked if I needed help. Told the guy about all the glass and he had me pull into the detail station and vacuumed it all up. That 2nd guy is the only reason this is a 2 star review. Without him it'd be 1 star since I can't give it zero stars. Also, there's still plenty of spots that looks like it was never touched.

Ordered a sonic bacon burger. Got home and there was no bacon. Also ordered cheese sticks with marinara and came with ranch. Basically every thing I ordered was wrong.

Thought I'd give it another try. Went again tonight. Pulled into the drive thru at 11:50pm. I realized they closed in 10 minutes so I was going to just get something small. After waiting 5 minutes for someone to ask for my order she comes on and asks what I want. Once I order she tells me they are closed. Why would you ask for my order only to tell me you are closed once I order? The worst Sonic I've ever been too. Atleast there's a Jack In The Box across the street.

Large humidor but the few times I've been here half the boxes are empty. If you are a Rocky Patel fan then you'll enjoy the selection. If you aren't a RP fan, like myself, it's slim picking. The prices are a little higher than I'm used too. I guess being the only shop in Anthem means you can charge a little more.   When I was in the humidor the guy working kept coming inside and moving things around. Since I've been out of the humidor and smoking, he hasn't gone into the humidor. Best way to make me never come back is to follow me around assuming I'm going to steal something. Tattoos and gauges doesn't equal thief.  Plus side is they have bottled beer and wine.   All in all, when I come to Anthem every Tuesday I'll just bring a cigar I bought elsewhere and smoke outside.

Best cigar shop on the Westside. I really enjoy walking into a shop where they remember your name and what cigars you smoke. I've never been suggested a bad cigar by them. If you want something they don't have, they'll just contact the Scottsdale shop and bring it over for you. No up sales either. They don't push more expensive sticks on you like a few other places do. All in all, it's pretty much the only place I buy cigars from.
