Lam's Seafood Market is a rare Asian gem in the Westside.. sort of like me ;-) haha just kidding.   I love this place! Great prices, fresh seafood :-) They also have a wide assortment of Filipino products which is a MUST for my kitchen.   The parking lot is a lil shady and could use some covering for the potholes.

If you are planning on spending 8 dollars for lunch at a fast food joint, all the while wishing you could have ANYTHING else but that, take your 8 dollars and head over to Thai Basil. I love love love this place!  Recently had the masaman curry with tofu, at a medium spicy level, and was so pleased that I vowed to return again the next day! The lunch combos come  with your main dish, a spring roll and rice. Next time, I will have to try the Thai Iced tea.  Fast and friendly service, clean restrooms, a really sweet Thai mom at the counter all make Thai Basil well deserving of 5 stars.

I've been to Phoenicia a handful of times, and each time I try something new and I am never dissapointed!  One thing I've noticed is that their daily specials are the best bet if you want to try something new and also get full. The daily specials usually are HUGE combos.  On different occassions, I've tried the falafel pita boat, the hummus trio, the chicken shawarma and the baklava. ALL delicious.  One tip- if you're in a rush, this may not be the best place to eat if you are coming during peak lunch hours. It's always packed. I've learned to go after 1pm and have had no problems being seated.

Recently attempted Friday happy hour here, and we failed. We met up a little bit before 6 pm but by the time we were seated it was 6:45.. OUCH. But regardless, the food was great. We ended up just sticking with sushi. The server recommended the lollipop roll. It's wrapped with cucumber instead of rice and it was delicious! We also had the calamari appetizer and a variety of other rools with iced green tea. Our total bill for 4 people was $91. WHOA.  It's definitely worth another visit though, but I would recommend coming way earlier to ensure HH prices. The music is good, albeit a tad loud.

Service- bad Quality of food- ehhh Price- WHAT THE ??!!!  Luckily, I didn't have to foot the bill for this place because it was just bad bad bad.  This review was mostly from the sushi bar. Ordered edemame, iced green tea, spicy tuna, las vegas roll and caterpillar roll. I had to stay with these very conventional rolls because honestly, I was scared to venture in uncharted territory at this place. Everything tasted worse than grocery store sushi..  And the Las Vegas roll was deep fried and way too crispy. Another gripe- most sushi places have affable sushi chefs- not the ones at Ichi Ban. They are rude, and look annoyed when you place an order.  Our waitress also took 15 minutes to even ask us about our drink orders.. in fact, I had to ask her to take our drink orders.   Overall- don't waste your time at this place.

So badly wanted this place to work out, because of the proximity to the house, but it just didn't fare out as much as I hoped O_O womp womp. I need consistency in the restaurants I visit, and after a couple of visits, Ranch House Grille got progressively dissapointing.  First visit: we ordered the half order of the chicken fried steak breakfast and the fried chicken and waffles. Yum! Loved that the half order was perfectly proportioned and at $7, perfect price. This visit topped it off and made us want to come back the next weekend.   Second visit: womp. womp. womp. This visit may have been a bad day for the chef because not only did they have to recook our chicken (leading to a really long wait) but the biscuits and gravy order was just not appetizing at all. The biscuits were so dense that after a while, it was actually tiring to chew!  So I don't know.. I need more Arcadia/East Phoenix brunch options.

Yo- any Asian grocery store I can go to where I can actually get around on a Saturday afternoon without being pushed over or banged on the back of my legs with a cart is A-OKAY by me. Not to mention, they have a 10% off your total bill promotion. NICE, right?  The prices are very similar to Lee Lee's, and I loved how there were filipino items in the meat section that was not frozen. For example, fresh longanisa?! Since they've closed the filipino owned and operated grocery store it's been really hard finding unfrozen longanisa and tocino. But TADAAA thanks Mekong Plaza :-) I think this place has great potential- it's beautiful, it's clean and I also give them a thumbs up for allowing community based organizations to host health fairs in their space. :-)

4 sides, shrimp tempura and chicken bbq all for 7.99. Good deal!  I like Paradise because of the food- very down to earth, comfort food for a hungry Pinay like me and also because I am an avid supporter of local businesses, especially immigrant owned businesses.  Back to the meal though: I came for dinner and the sides that I chose were steamed broccoli, a cabbage vegetable dish, glass noodles and macaroni salad of course! All very scrumptious and totally filling. I was halfway thru my to go box and pretty much had to stop because I was so full. Another plus- it's within walking distance of the lightrail, so even if you are not near ASU or Tempe, it's a good place to check out.  Other things to note: 1) no public restrooms 2) they close at 9pm most nights I believe 3) they are not open on sundays

Love it!  Ordered the Po' Boy shrimp with a side of potato salad and was so amazed with the entire dish. I would have to say that this is the best Po' Boy I've ever had. The bread was soft and delicious and the shrimp was plenty and fresh.  I really wanted to have the oysters, but they were out of stock *sad face.* Next time I visit, I would like to try the peach cobbler dessert, and I hope they will have the oysters in stock too. So delicious!

I was so surprised that Famous Uncle Al's was a franchise! I thought it was just a local mom and pop shop.. Anyway, I recently visited with my uncle and my little sister. I ordered the italian beef, my uncle got the patty melt and fries, lil sis ordered chili fries and a corn dog. My italian beef was delicious! I really loved the bread, the sauce, the sweet peppers. I paired my meal with the delicious french fries and a cherry pepsi. It was an awesome combo! Very affordable and friendly service.

I love love love this place. I was born in Chicago, but was raised pretty much in Phoenix, but my family always talks about Chicago Hot Dogs, Italian Beef, you name it. Since I haven't been to Chicago as an adult, I figured checking out the local Chicago-ish places will have to do (for now at least) I brought my Grandma who lived in Chicago for many years and she gave this place a stamp of approval too. She ordered the Italian Beef and it was scrumptious.   I ordered the Chicago Dog and a basket of fried zuchinni and it was divine. I would have ordered two more Chicago Dogs if I would have worn my "fat pants" that day. (Mental Note for next time)  Customer Service- very friendly Prices- very affordable  And they have specials- .50 cent sliders on Fridays and .30 cent wings on Wednesdays.   YUMMYYYYYY.

Smashburger being within walking distance from my work is pure temptation. Just this past week I met some friends here for a quick bite.  I ended up ordering the 1/3 pound classic smashburger with haystack onions as an add-on. I had to go with the smash fries, and am really glad I did. The smashfries are tossed with olive oil, rosemary, garlic and "other herbs." Hmmm what are those other herbs? I would travel the world to find out what- that's how good they are. Almost as good as the fries at Fez :-)  To top it off, the manager checked in on our table multiple times to bring us back any condiments, ask us what we thought about the burgers, and to see if we needed anything else. Loved  the service!  Thanks for coming to the Valley Smashburger. We heart you!

Recently had friday night happy hour here and it was a great experience. I heard of the Grind from the blog- www.thefreshfiends.com and was immediately drawn to the idea of trying to create an ambience of a neighborhood pub, and of course the donuts lured me in too! We arrived just a little bit before 6pm, and scored happy hour prices- $5 for a glass of wine and $1 off any beer.  I ordered the portello mushroom burger, blue moon, sweet potato fritters and the infamous donuts with the creamy, butterscotch topping. I loved it all except the sweet potato fritters. A little bit too mushy for my liking. Overall, loved the ambience, the decor and would definitely come back again.

Great service, lots of awesome daily specials. On Sundays they have happy hour all day and special for 5 dollar rustics. Matt and justin are great servers! Super friendly and helpful!

Poor customer service... they barely glance up when you walk in the door. I am sure this prime location costs a lot in rent, so you would think they would be better with greeting customers and making sure they get served promptly. So not the case. Walked in, was told to wait for 5 minutes, over 20 minutes later, still no service and no acknowledgement. Extremely disrespectful.

Elsie was so sweet from taking my appointment over the phone to servicing the counter! It's such a nice change to feel welcomed at a car repair shop! I usually dread them as much as the dentists office. I used a groupon and walked out paying just $4.99 for a synthetic oil change and tire rotation. There's lots of great restaurants nearby too. Loved the atmosphere and the ambience.

Great service and pretty quick. The tri tip sandwich was the highlight! Super soft and flavorful. There are two options for wings: fried chicken wings and smoked wings. The fried wings are split drummettes, while the smokes wings are whole. I loved the trio of bbq sauces but the Carolina vinegar was the best. Definitely will come back. Support local businesses!
