Dog town has never been anything but great with my dogs..I have taken both of them there many times.  They don't keep the dogs in kennels together with is a huge plus.  They have always dome a good job (or fixed something if it wasn't right) and have n=been very courteous.

My husband & I took our '01 Indian into this shop to get some work done(oil cooler, pipes, bars, added lights, and repair/paint my fender and add a custom sissy bar). We took it in around may 7th. So after a few months (Aug 15) back and fourth on the phone on what should be done about pipes and bars and just buttoning up everything, my husband informed this shop that he'd like to pick up with ample time to get it done (we had been out of town so we gave over 1 weeks notice that we would be back).   Long story short, we get a bike without a Fender because "their paint guy" isn't finished, and they can't get a hold of him.  They told us a week later they still can't get it and they have to buy a new fender and UPS it to me.... Additionally they FORGOT to put the seat bolts on AS WELL!!!  What if my husband and I were in an accident!!! You guys still think it's funny! I was a 1.5 qt low on oil. And I find that I have hardware missing for the fender!  The break light was also not working because they assembled the starter switch housing incorrectly. .... This shop looks cool and the people seem cool, but they're really not.  When we finally got the fender the paint on it was low quality, not what we paid for.  And they "forgot" that we discussed the sissy bar so we still don't have one.  I'm telling you, DON'T TRUST THIS SHOP! Effing Thieves! ... And of course there's gonna be those "enablers" (friends, co-workers family), try and deflect truthful reviews about this place. ... Yes, Michael is a nice guy. But his WORK blows.  They didn't even try to make it right. But Hey, it's your bike.
