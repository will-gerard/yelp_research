Went in for a re-screening of my patio door, GREAT service, nice job, fast turnaround, good price. I found a place that understands customer service!

Good food, good service. It is time to replace the salt and pepper grinders! After three different sets I gave up. I think the staff thought I was being picky, I like pepper, what's wrong with that? The dinner was very good and tasted fresh, the salad was crisp and cold, tells me they cook and prepare to order.

We Found ourselves in a situation as to what were we going to do with family "heirlooms" MOVING company! from the first contact to the final piece being placed we were treated like we were the most important and valued customer ever. Great pricing and courteous and professional service from the office staff to the movers themselves.

Thought we would check this out, when we walked in our ears were assaulted by music that was not the best for a dining experience, not sure what they are going for, but they missed out on our business

I have eaten BBQ all over the country, this is by far the BEST Phoenix has to offer. The people who work here are awesome. The owner happened to be there the night we stopped in, what a great guy. Try the Pecan pie and the beans and cornbread could be a meal on their own
