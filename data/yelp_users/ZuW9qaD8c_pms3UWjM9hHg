I was at the cafe side of this restaurant. The "breakfast sandwiches" were pre-made and disgusting. It was a stuffed croissant filled with mostly cheese and scrambled eggs (not very much) and chunks of ham. I don't like ham, but there was no other choice if I wanted eggs, which is usually what people get with their breakfast. I could only eat half of it and had to toss it.

The BEST! Everyone is super friendly here. Samantha is amazing! I have so much fun and feel so great when I leave. I get so many compliments on my hair. The decor is so fun. If you are not coming here for your hair needs, you're crazy.

Super friendly employees, delicious subs. They were very understanding when we came in at 9:20 and they closed at 10.  They were quick and accommodating and explained their menu and options. Seth was very kind and we will be returning for sure.
