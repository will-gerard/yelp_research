From happy hour to regular dining I'm never disappointed with the service or food. The beef carpaccio and brio burger are my faves along with the Kaiken Malbec. Wish I could eat here every night of the week.

The food was good but the service was not desirable. No one around to seat us and when we finally found an employee they seemed annoyed to seat us. What we ordered fit into their special but we were not told of it and payed more with getting less. Weird experience. Would not recommend.

I love The Beast burrito so much that I rarely stray from it but couldn't resist going for the lunch special which is choice of 2tacos and half size soup or salad for under $10.   The patio is perfect for an alfreso lunch on a sunny afternoon.

The atmosphere is great daytime or evening. Can't say much for the food since I haven't loved anything I've ordered from salad, to tacos or burgers. The house cab is great and so is  the new fashioned. I suggest it just for drinks.
