We ordered several pizzas to be delivered. They came late, cold, and very overdone.  Hard to judge the quality when they come in that condition.

Stopped in for a flat bread pizza and a beer, instead opted for wings and breaded zucchini. They were both great!  Outstanding service. This place is only a few months old, but with great food and a nice ambiance, it's well worth a visit.
