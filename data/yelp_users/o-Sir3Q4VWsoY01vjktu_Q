Great cafes are one of my favorite things. Good coffee is just one of the required features that these spots must have. There are relaxation factors, the accommodations themselves, the vibe, the clientele, etc. Fair Trade definitely has passed the test with most of these factors...therefore placing it high on my list of favorite things!  The cafe is located in the Arts District right along Roosevelt. It's right across the street from a train stop, so it's real convenient! Once inside, the vibe is pretty cool. There are plenty of tables and plenty of bars along the windows for a good view while you drink your espressos. Paintings line the walls sparingly, giving it a artsy kind of vibe, while at the same time not going overboard with it.  I ordered a vanilla latte with almond milk and stood around and waited. The menu looked real interesting, and when I go back, I'll definitely give some of their food a try. It seems as if they had a lot of veggie and vegan options which is always awesome. There were a few people scattered here and there around the place..I could totally see this spot being packed or close to being full on a regular basis. I got my beverage and headed outside to one of the many tables out front. They also have a back entrance which also has more outside seating as well.   My latte had a nice, strong flavor balanced with the nice, sweet flavor of the almond milk. It was a perfect mix...not too much of either elements. I sat...relaxed....and watched the traffic pass by as I cleared my head.   Nice location...nice coffee.

I've been through Douglas International several times. Normally it's the same routine for me... when I have a short layover I come in and go out. When it's a little longer, I normally have a beer and some sushi out in the open area at Hissho Sushi. This particular time I had a 2 hour layover for a early morning flight, and had to catch my plane down in the A terminal...a place that I had never been before.  As I wandered down this particular terminal, I noticed that there was little down there. It was a smaller area with a lot less to offer. The biggest place that I saw was the Uptown Bar & Lounge. They had multiple large screen televisions and a huge bar, so I decided to wait out my 2 hours here.   They had a full bar and were also offering a small breakfast menu. I decided to go that route and ordered a egg and cheese sandwich on wheat along with grits, a mimosa, and a cup of coffee.  The coffee was pretty decent. It wasn't as strong as I like, but at the same time it wasn't watery like a lot of other places. The mimosa wasn't anything special. I just watched the bartender pour some juice in some champagne. I eventually got my meal, which is served on a plastic plate along with plastic ware. The egg sandwich was something that I normally make when I'm in a rush and half awake in the mornings. Nothing special at all...actually a little below average. The plastic bowl of grits had a few lumps and no flavor at all.  The bartender was nice, not anything overwhelming, but she was nice, and polite, and gave me what I ordered. You can't ask for more than that.  If you have a flight out of A, this is a decent spot to grab a drink and watch some TV. Unless you have a flight leaving out of A, there's no reason to venture down that way. Uptown Bar & Lounge doesn't really deserve the ride down the moving sidewalk.

I was in AZ for business and luckily had a few hours of down time to go exploring. Yelp is the best tool for anyone to have when you aren't sure of specific spots to go, and it came in handy yet again. I found a whole street (Roosevelt) filled with coffee shops, markets, and art. Bragg's was close by, and the reviews and their menu looked awesome..so that was my destination for lunch.  I could feel the vibe from this spot at first glance. This building itself is a piece of art. The decorated planters, the hanging art...the vibe is so awesome. The establishment sits on a triangular corner, and the interior space is minimal, but you are surrounded on both sides by full windows that fill the dining area with light in the daytime. There are a few tables lined up on the sidewalk outside as well..very cool setup altogether.  I saw so many items on the menu that I wanted to try, but I was still in a breakfast mode so I went with the scrambled tofu with a side of eggplant bacon. The waitress was very helpful. The service kind of an extension of the building itself..very cheerful and welcoming!  The tofu scramble was very well done. Mixed with grilled onions and peppers...it was the perfect dish to fill up on. The eggplant bacon was real good too. It didn't really have a bacon taste, but the texture was similar to a well done piece of bacon. It wasn't crisp, but it had that chewy texture to it. A perfect side dish for the tofu.  I was talked into trying a piece of pie (OK, it wasn't hard to convince me) and the triple berry was suggested...I went with it! It was soooo good. The tartness of the berries mixed with the flakiness of the crust was awesome! I couldn't believe that they got a vegan crust to be this flaky!!! This was definitely the best part of my meal...and it was all good!  Bragg's is definitely on my list of places to stop by whenever I'm in Phoenix.
