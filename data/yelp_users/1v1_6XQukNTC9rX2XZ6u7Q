I was always weary of going to chiropractors because I never really felt comfortable with them.. That was of course until my roommate referred me to Dr Nance.  What a wonderful experience from Day 1.  The staff are amazing, and I always feel like my care is his # 1 concern.  My adjustments are quick and easy and I'm out of there very quickly.  A+ for time management, and A+ for being cost effective and courteous to everyone that walks thru that door.  I highly recommend him.

Meh. It could have been a lot better. Way too many sale associates for the amount of employees doing custom fittings. Many store associates just walking around instead of helping other consumers in the store.

Distasteful service. How can you be out of decaf and not apologize for it? You are Starbucks....right? I didn't even order it. The lady in front of me did. Sad.
