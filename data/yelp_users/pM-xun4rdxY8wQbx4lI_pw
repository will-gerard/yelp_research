Took my m5 here the last few times I had a car wash.  Had a great experience overall, I chose the 'Arcadia' wash which for what they do (hand wash, interior, windows, tires) is a great bargain compared to other area hand car washes.    The place isn't the fanciest, but I will tell you the service is top notch and they really do a great job of inside-out cleaning.  Would highly recommend to anyone.  As others mentioned, only downside is a longer wait, but worth it for the extra mile they go to clean the car.    Last time I went, had some real bad wheel grime/buildup and they spent literally 15 mins scrubbing all the wheels to get it clean!

The good:  Great sushi, very fresh and good variety of rolls, sushi, and cooked dishes/entrees. Ambiance is clean and upscale. Owner and staff are delightful.  For large groups, I recommend asking for the large table in back.  The sushi bar is also enjoyable for single or party of two.   Our favorite sushi restaurant in the east valley!  The bad:  It's a small place, so call ahead for reservations especially on weekend nights.

Good service, very clean, and one of the best tasting bowls of Pho in the East Valley.

Had the opportunity to use Pit Stop twice now, once for an in-shop car detail and the other for a mobile car wash at my home.  Marcus and the team were absolutely easy to work with both times.  Service was top notch and they did an excellent job detailing and washing my Porsche.  Their Scottsdale shop is clean, convenient, and appears to be high quality all the way around.  I'm quite specific about the technique and products used to wash/clean my car given its age, Pit Stop provided great care and listened to my needs.  Will definitely trust them to wash/detail my car again.

Pretty poor customer service and rude staff.  Went in there to exchange a phone case and screen protector because the associate mistakenly gave the wrong one and they were less than helpful.  I guess they only appear nice and willing to help when you are buying something or signing up.

Patrick did a great job cleaning our 9 room home, he scrubbed, treated, and conditioned them and left them looking and smelling great.  Highly recommend Hydrocare for any carpet cleaning needs.
