Okay, so it takes a bit to get food but if you have a talkative group you won't even notice. The waitresses are very nice and attentive which I like. The food I ordered a chicken enchilada with a soft carne asada taco.. It was amazing. I ate it very quickly not only because I was hungry but because it was good.   The only reason why this place did not get 5 stars is due to the wait for food.. Other than that I will definitely come back!

I have been to this location many many times and each time the service is great, the food is amazing, and I always want to get an ice cream!. The coffee is good along with the shakes.. Though it's open for lunch and dinner I will most likely come back every day for lunch if I could!! Recommend this place!

So far I have been here about 3-5 time within the last 6 months. And I have to say I keep coming back because the food is amazing and the staff are great. They have a large menus of sorts I seem to stay in the breakfast area. But I have brought many people on over here to try a great place for food and experience.

First time here and it was a good experience. It wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. The waitress was nice and luckily when we sat down we Knew what we wanted they had a sign up for their specials.  I ordered the French toast with egg and bacon. The eggs were an ihop style but the ready was not it was good.  This place is good and I will be going back.

I seriously wish I can give this place a -5 star rating! It has been extremely frustrating never in my many years of being a firestone customer. I have trusted them to do the right thing and they have completely ruined my vehicle and expect me to pay more. I went in for a 4 hour job and it has been 4 days since I dropped it off and yet I still do not have my vehicle and they made the issue worse! The manager had the audacity to tell me things happen! Are you kidding me it was okay and now something is 10 times worse!! Are you kidding me! Not going back. I refuse pay for anymore services from firestone!

5 stars for this old favorite..  This place is one of the few places that will serve me menudo the way I like it and on a MONDAY!  I love menudo but just the corn so I ask for just corn. Most places just serve me whatever they serve which I hate. BUT this place did actually try to remove all of the meat from my bowl! I was extremely happy!   They serve homemade tortillas just like my aunt makes which I love!  The waitress was very attentive and the food good. I will be coming back for more!

Overall I have nothing bad to say. The waitress was attentive. The food was great. I ate all of my soup and sandwich. My husband ate all of his burger and fries.  Inside it was nice and clean they also have a patio that had a good amount of shade and seating options.  The food presentation was nice and clean. I would love to come back here for more!

Ok Second time been here and both time I have gotten good service and good food! The street tacos are great along with the quesadillas (only things I have tried so far). The salsa has a roasted pepper flavor but overall good and not too spicy! Definitely coming back for more when I crave Mexican food!

Well the food was great but the experience was very unprofessional. Our waitress was working hard doing her thang when our fellow table diners decided to give her a hard time. After a discussion with the manager the other diners were able to figure things out. Well I felt that it was very unprofessional that the chef "Kyle" I believe was down talking his fellow coworkers to the guests at out table. To me this is very unprofessional especially since the girl was clearly having a bad time with this guest yet he decided to play on the blame game and get bad talk his coworkers. Horrible experience at this place. There should be no exception of talking bad about your coworkers to customers especially.

Ok I'm not sure what the big fuss is about because I have been here 3 times and each time has been great! Me and my husband see 2 different doctors and they are both great to talk to and the assistants are good as well.   They have an on-sight lab so blood can be drawn. Overall coming back and happy to do so!

Each time I come here I am greeted by a full staff that are willing to help with anything I need. The Doctors are very nice and the staff knows there stuff. The frame inventory is great! And many sets to choose from. I ended up getting the retinal imaging which is well worth it just to make sure my eyes are healthy!.

So we love BBQ.. Just gonna start off with that. We want our meat to be fresh and hell just off of grill type of meat!.   This place did not have that. It was like we got the damn left overs.  My husband got the pulled pork sandwich his results: warmed up, gotten from the bottom the tray, and ruined the sandwich.  Grandpa got the beef brisket sandwich results: not fresh, it was cold, dry, tough, and you can tell has been sitting out because there was absolutely no pink anywhere in those tough slices. I got a hot link sandwich results: burned hot links, extremely dry and tough.  Overall, not going back. The lady was an interesting character, a customer notified her that the root beer was out. She said "okay don't touch it". And did nothing about it. The inside to me is pretty gross as far as the kitchen goes.. So i chose 1 star because I have to and Because the BBQ Sauce is OKAY!

The reason I am giving this place 4 stars is well I found absolutely nothing wrong with this place. The tables,floors,counter, kitchen area all clean.  They have indoor and outdoor seating with a drive up window for phone and online orders. They had Mexican music playing in the background. If you were eating there they give you chips and salsa for the table and bring you your meal. The salsa was good and the breakfast burrito I had was great! All in all good place to get a burrito or Mexican meal. I will be going back.  The reason for the 4 stars also I only had one thing. It's hard to mess up a burrito. But I will be updating when I try something else.

Well the 1 star is for the food the pizza is truly authentic and tastes amazing. My compliments.  The reason for my -4 is due to the service. My party of 3 walk in and see if something is available well we are subject to a wait which is normal I'm not worried. But what irritates me is that we sit down they bring us water which is great. I could use some water but that is all they give us we were not asked if we wanted something else just assumed water. So then they ask if what we wanted so we placed an order and there was no further offer of something to drink. We wanted to try a few beers and a bottles coke.   After we are done eating and just sitting down we notice other people were given bread and a new party just sat down and were asked. "Can I get you something to drink?." Are you kidding me.  If I decide to come back it will be for the food not the service.

Ok so. I grew up in Phoenix and I have been to this place a total of 4 times including this visit. Each time I have never had a bad experience with the service or food. So this visit: Went in got seated immediately greeted nicely. Was given our drinks. We ordered our food and it was delivered to our table pretty quickly.   The food:  I ordered the Enchilada Dinner - great dinner Hubs: Chimichanga - spicy but good ate it all Pops: Red Chili plate- great! Ate it all. The chips and salsa of course spicy salsa but continued to eat it.   No bad experience or review. Will be coming back.   The food is SPICY! So don't ask for Mild they Don't Got it!

First time here and definitely not the last.. We got a 3 course and of course shared it all. Haha we got a salad (I forgot the name) but it was almost like a Caesar but not quite and still to me even better!  The pizza we got was a Diavola? With added Italian sausage. The pizza was gone in minutes!. It was really good the salami had a small kick but a good kick. You can tell everything was fresh the taste was just so much better. The crust I loved it wasn't too crispy but just right.  Dessert we got a Nutella Crepe with Ice Cream. Omg! Love love this simple dessert!   The only reason why no 4 stars I got a latte and that was no Bueno. And parking is all street parking. The waitress at first was a little rude but then that's her fault she didn't ask if we have been there before especially since we were asking amateur questions. Lol other than those will be coming back for more.

So overall great place.. The decor is pretty neat it's dark inside with the windows covered and closed. The furniture was dark woods and just cool. Almost like entering another world.   It wasn't busy we went and sat ourselves. The waiter was patient and let us look through the menu. The Pasty I got was a Chicken Alfredo and Hubs got Spicy Cajun. Both of which are good. I never take food home but this one I am taking home.   Will def be coming back.

I honestly expected more authentic Mexican food coming to the original location. Unfortunately that is not what I got. The food was very greasy and the taste was bland. The salsa was not good which I think can make a restaurant. The salsa is important this reminded me of the bottled Paste salsa.  I'm only giving 2 stars due to the service. And the Bloody Mary I drank which was good. Other than that the food was mediocre. Will not be coming back.

Walking in it was clean. We went during the day it was pretty dead.  Hubs got a buffalo chicken sandwich  I got Mozzarella sticks Friend got bacon burger.  The overall food was ok. Not like Amazing. The waitresses seemed to be a bit pre occupied with taking selfies and creating a human pyramid versus taking care of us.  The place just seemed to lack management and the proper scheduling there was like 15 girls to 5 customers/tables. Way over staffed for the time. But what Evs would I go back probably not.

Well let's just say ihop has taken last place in food. I came here for breakfast and the fruit that I got well was. Gross.. Both gross looking and tasting. You can tell it was frozen. The eggs are not real eggs they are a fake gray looking color. The only thing that was good on my plate would be the toast.. Not going back.

Okay,  Well I have lived in Phoenix my whole life and this was the first time I visited this place. Needless to say I am not impressed. The chicken was great but the rest well very expensive and not that great. I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was completely watered down. Not sure how but yeah. We ordered the filet and it was pretty dry. The ribs were dry and fell off the bone too easily. Other than that the bill was hella pricey.. The service was good it wasn't horrible. Would I go back? Probably not. Not for that price.

Extremely satisfied with this company! They not only give a great price but they are fast and clean!  We had a total of 6 trees to be removed. With 7 stumps to be ground they got here at 10a and we're done and cleaned 12:45p! Amazing! Definitely going to call for my smaller bushes and stumps on the side of the house. But I'm loving it!

This place is good. The hours aren't very friendly so I dropped them down a star. The service is good with nice waitresses that are getting things done out in the cold/heat. The food is good I get the eggs Benedict and my hubs got the American breakfast. He liked it and so did I.. Depending on the time, and weather I will be coming back.  Downside- your outside under this huge tree and exposed to the elements. Including the animals as well. The tree sheds of course and may get on your food. Flies and Birds are around.

This place is great to grab a bite to eat hang out and relax. The inside is pretty interesting brick floors and interior. The food is good as well. I have been here about 5 times now and they have never did me wrong. It's a great place for a big party or simply going to grab a bite to eat by yourself. You can even order ahead.. :-0

The salsa was just not for me. But the burros were good. Would come back for more. The green salsa was ok. It just wasn't hot but had a good taste but it was missing the spice. The burros are huge-ish but good.  Second time coming here was great! Loved the burro!   Now onto my 3rd time for breakfast burrito!

Came here with some friends for a Grown Up Date Night. Our Chef was great! He kept it interesting and is laughing. We drank, laughed, and ate so much so I feel like I'm going to burst! It's easy to get a $100 check here but for the good time it's ok.  The Chicken Fried Rice is always spot on with that Garlic Butter! Nam nam!   Would come back. I had a reservation and were sat within 10 min of arriving. Not bad. It was packed though so make sure you have a reservation!

Wow the coffee! Amazing! You can tell it is high quality, skill and of course love. What some people don't understand is that when you have a coffee made with love it is tastes amazing and when it is made in a hurry it tastes horrible and sloppy. This place is definitely amazing. I plan to come back as often as possible!   - side note: it's easier to find when you come though the back of the plaza or look for the barber shop with an espresso bar and there you have it! :)

Lisa wonderful. She is very nice and gives you an amazing cut. I came here about 6 months ago to get my hair trimmed I was a walk in and they took me in. After having my hair long for years I decided to make a drastic decision by cutting my hair short. I called Monday made and appointment for Thursday and got color cut and style in about an hour and a half..   Lisa was very helpful in helping me decide how short I wanted to go and how short I should go being that this is my first time getting my hair cut this short. In the end color, cut and style I am completely happy with the results and will be coming back in soon for the up keep and possible going shorter!

Ok so I have been coming here for more than a year. In the morning the food is great. Now mind you I get the burritos so that is all I can comment on. The Salsa is great as well! This is the cleanest Filibertos I have been to not only that they are quick. Call in your order tell them how long and it's ready by the time you pick it up.  The reason for the no 5 star I can't find them on the darn Google search it's only on Yelp.

Best BBQ Spot in South Phoenix! First time here and definitely not the last! They gave us samples of the brisket to try. And damn it was amazing! The brisket is where it's at, it was not tough and you can tell it was made with passion..   The BBQ sauce they have reg and spicy both are amazing! The spicy has a kick but it's one where you can't stop eating it! Hubby got the Po Boy and he has no regrets and even though he was full he still kept eating it was so good!   Definitely coming back for more!

Well nothing bad to say. The place was great. They had a soup of the day which was Potato Bacon which I got a cup of. It was good. I also got a sandwich that was so good. They were fast and efficient. These are heavy sandwiches but they also have wraps and salads which I will have to try next time I stop by. Because the sandwiches were good and of course I like soup so that works for me to have a place that has soup!

Overall pretty cool place to go. The BBQ is good and if it's your first time there they give you a sample of the meat. When you walk in you will see these huge tubs of ice with drinks (beers,soda). They also have fountain drinks as well.  The meat is good too. I was not a fan of the moist brisket. But the lean brisket, turkey and something else that involved brisket was good. Would def go back.

So my appointment was at 1pm.. Filled out the form in 10 min so 1:10p.. It's now:1:35pm And am barely being taken to the back. But I'm a new patient and of course all the info takes time.  Met the FNP Nichole she is great very friendly and a smile on her face. Is it time consuming for a new patient dr appt yes. Just like any other place. But they seem nice.   First impression walking in was ok it's clean and simple. They have a television and magazines to read. No Wifi which I can understand because it's a doctors office with personal information. The rooms were clean. I am good with this practice and would come back!

Okay, here it is..  I ordered the moo goo gai pan (spell check?) with dumplings and that's it.  Overall, the food was good. The dumplings were on point. You know they are homemade when you see the cook preparing them! I was happy with that. The greens in my entree were green and fresh. One thing I appreciated was the fact that they make the food to order. My entree was supposed to be with mushrooms I asked for no mushrooms and that's what I got.    The server was well you can tell family but he did well kept our glasses full and he was attentive!  Definitely will be going back for more!   Also for those who are Paleo they have a lettuce wrap pretty cool!! I will have to try it!

First time here.. Kept an open mind.  My mind was blown! I got the Soup of the Day and The Guild Chicken Taco. The taco itself looked pretty good but when I tasted it, it was gone within a matter of seconds. After I wanted another one it was that good.  The soup was a beef and veggie soup, overall it was soup. The beef had a good taste to it and the cast iron bowl it came in was convenient and kept my soup nice and hot.  The Hubs got a smoked pork torta. Which he thought was good as well..   My favorite part was the chips and salsa. I make homemade salsa all the time and am usually doctoring up restaurant salsa but this one. Nothing to change it was great! Spicy, Peppery. And just right!   The only reason why I did not give a 5th star was due to the long wait. We asked our waiter for the check and it took him about 5 min to do so. Which we were in a rush that's why we asked. But besides that everything was good!   Next time I will plan better but definitely going back.

We wanted to try something different and we see this place and want to check it out.  We got here at 2:45ish it was virtually empty meaning 2 other tables to wait on. So we were seated and drinks were provided.   We ordered: cheese platter= great Western Burger= lots of meat! Great taste 3 Alarm Burger= talk about spicy but great taste to it. Trio Sliders?= I got Grilled Cheese, Bacon Turkey Swiss, and Regular slider= all were great the pretzel bread makes it great! The food was Great! They have a large beer variety which is good news for a brewery.   The service though the lady was nice but damn if she didn't take 10 min to check back in on us and give us our check. So lost a star there.

So happy with this service so far. We went today to go pick out some trees. They have a special "123 Starter" package that is totally worth it. Overall we saved $900 for 3 trees and tree shrubs. Now I can't wait to get them planted. They plant every Tuesday. Btw. Thanks guys!

Overall 4 stars- I was not expecting the Country Fried Chicken to be the way it was. It wasn't my cup of tea. BUT!  The ribeye and chicken breast grilled was good.. The fried pickles almost like home cooked and the bread is to die for! Will be going back for more maybe try the ribs..

Well first I'm going to start off with the stock of cigars.. They have a huge walk in humidor but the shelves were kind of empty and so were the boxes. I think the staff might have been having too much of a good time and forgetting about restocking or they just haven't ordered much.  Just like most places they didn't carry Liga Privada cigars. But what was surprising they didn't have NUBS or Gurkha cigars.  Clean place and the atmosphere was relaxed and open. Especially since myself (a woman) walked in. Lol  The building was huge and has a lot of potential. They even conduct haircuts and shave everyday so that's cool. It's totally a mans hang out which is good. Any who would come back in hopes of a bigger selection for Hubs!
