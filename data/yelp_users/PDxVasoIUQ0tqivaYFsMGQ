Great service!!! I ordered Galbitang but it was so salty. I had to pour in a cup full of hot water. Flavor was okay but just too much MSG. Side dishes were also very salty.  I gave it 4 star because the serving staff were very attentative & greets everyone who walks in regarless of what they were doing.

Awesome service!!! Usually big corporate places lack in service but this location is great from the moment you walk in. Everyone makes you feel welcome from the moment you walK in.  It can get busy but the staff is very courtious.   Tried fried calamari appetizer & it goes really well with two sauces served (honey mustard & tomato sauce...I think).  We came in for a birthday party & everyone was overly satisfied with the service & food. We had Bacon wrapped sirloin medallion, philly cheese steak, bistro steak & shrimp, Bass fish & so much more.  Thanks to the staff & management at Dave & Busters, my staff & family had a marvelous time.  THANK YOU!!!

I made a take out order from here & the gentle man who answering the phone was ver friendly but was trying to tell me depending on the delivery, the vegetables could be fresh or maybe not. They have no control over how the get the vegetables. I ordered at 10:15ish & picked up around 10:30ish. I get a call from a lady (maybe the owner) around 12:30 stating I didn't pick up my pho. Explained I picked up around 10:30. She insisted I picked it up from the other pho restaurant in the same complex. I sincerely apologized if I made a mistake. She then says how I ate the bad pho & that her pho is much better & no other restaurant can compare pho with her's. Insisted I return the pho & come eat her pho.  I can understand where she stands but this all happened 2 hours later. I guess she was expecting me hold on to my food & not eat it. Very rude the way she said it, I thought! I wouldn't go just because of her attitude.

Great service & great food. Broth is so clear & not greasy at all. It is great to have such clear broth for after drinking. Beef chow fun was just cooked to perfection. It wasn't salty at all.  Vegetables in the springroll was fresh & not discolored.  Thank you for an awsome experience!

Wow!!! I can't believe how great the service is.  I had variety of things here. Sushi was great. The portion is a lot for the price. For Scottsdale, it's the average price but definitely much more portion.  Gamjatang is to die for!!! Side dishes are blend & I was told it's because for health reason...which I agree but does need a little bit more flavor. I can't rave more enough about this place.  I don't know how I never found this place sooner. They also have my favorite drink (Hwayo 23). I will be a regular here for sure. Definitely try the tuna tataki salad for sure if you like good sushi & something healthy.

Great broth! So clear & clean.  I had the ox-tail soup & it really hit the spot. Noodle was slightly less cooked but it was very good. It would have been a home away from home food if it was served with ginger sauce on the side for dipping ox-tail. Great broth!!!

As always, the oxtail soup broth is so good. I just realized it's also very good for hung overs...lol. The broth is made clear & not greasy at all. You don't see any floating oil,fat like some of the other chinese restaurant that serve oxtail soup.

Great service!!! Our server came by often to check on our drinks & recommended what's great from the kitchen. Don't let this place fool you with it's looks (looks dirty). Food is awesome...great presentation & great portion for it's price. Live entertainment on top! The band was awesone. Playing the 70-80's music & they were great. Out door patio for smokers too. Thank you for a great night Jolie!!!

Really great food!!! Who would have thought a brewy place would have such a great food too. From appetizers to dessert to entree, they've all did an awesome job. Couldn't be any satisfied!!! Must try the wings. The meat is so tender & the seasoning was just right. Mushroom burger is to die for. I'm not a burger person but I actually ate the whole burger. Dessert with fruit was awesome. They really use fresh fruits. It's not the frozen ones you buy in a bag. Thank you for an awesome experience!

Great food! I like the fact that they don't use ajinomoto in the food. Side dishes were not overly seasoned & not salty at all. I gave it 4 star because there was a dog.

Again, food is pretty good but everytime I go in, something just doesn't feel right. There's only one server, an older male server who seem to be friendly at first but gets grouchy toward the end of my meal or each visit. No refill on drinks unless asked or check to make sure if everything is ok. I wanted to make something to go but he immediately took away the menu as I was ordering my food to eat there. He doesn't seem like he want to be there.

I like pho a lot & I can have it everyday. It is also my hung over soup...lol. This place has very goid broth & it's not oily at all. I don't feel thirst aftervleaving here...which means no MSG. I like that a lot. However, I always like to have some freshly made spring rool with my pho but the vegetables in the spring roll was at least a day or two old because the color of the lettuce was pink/orange looking. If it wasn't for the old vegetables, i would have given a 5 star. Would definitly recommand pho.

Great service as always & on time. I always get the pho with beef, trip & tendon & have never been dusappointed. They try to cater to their customers as much as possible. I've asked to gave bbq pork & shrimp in my spring roll & they accomodated with no extra charge.  Thank you for making it for me!!!
