This place is ok... I don't love their coffee and after adding protein to a smoothie it cost nearly $10. I can get the equivalent for no more than $6 up the street. The food items are overpriced and nothing special in comparison to Buzzberry's competitors in town. Id much rather drive through D'Lish or stop at Olive & Ivy Marketplace or Chop Shop!

Came in for happy hour and stayed through dinner! They have an awesome selection of happy hour items. We tried the stuffed mushrooms and fried pickles, which were both delicious! Our server was knowledgable about the wines and helped us pick out a great bottle Chardonnay which happened to be $20 on happy hour! We also ordered the Mac n cheese, meat balls and butternut squash soup. The meatballs were honestly some of the best I've had... The sauce was delicious.  We'll be coming back here! Especially for happy hour!

The guys here are awesome! So helpful, knowledgable and friendly. I've taken my car here 5 or 6 times for a variety of reasons and I've left happy each time. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for honest car care.

Great place! My spray tans have always turned out even and the color is natural looking.

I purchased the Groupon for this salon. It took several weeks for me to get an appointment that worked with my schedule. Unfortunately, I used this Groupon right before my brother's wedding and the gel mani/pedi were so awful I had to spend another $50 at another salon to have my nails fixed. The nail tech was inexperienced and it was obvious. My cuticles looked worse when I left than they did when I walked into the salon. The gel was applied too thick and began peeling off an hour after I left. I wouldn't recommend purchasing the Groupon, or going to this salon under any circumstances.

They never have the juice I want in stock. The staff is rude. Beware when purchasing a Groupon- it forces you to go back twice and spend $10 just to use the groupon. The juice I got was $8.30 so I owed them another $1.70. Basically I saved nothing with the groupon. Won't be returning because there are much better cold pressed juice options in the area!

I got the Fiesta Bowl with quinoa for lunch and it was delicious! It actually reminded me of a much healthier version of a Chipotle veggie burrito bowl. While the food was great, the portion was way too large and no single person should eat that much of anything in one sitting, especially at lunch. Seriously, there was enough quinoa for a family of four. I will definitely be going back to RAW to try some other stuff, however, I wish they would lose the chalkboards and get some menus that are easier to read. The Build Your Own offering is not advertised in the restaurant and had I known they offered that option, I would have built my own bowl. I give the food 4 stars and the ambiance and decor about 2. Glad there are some healthier spots opening in Scottsdale!

I absolutely love spin at Fit Republic. This review has nothing to do with the classes they offer, but everything to do with the horrible customer service.  I've been a member for more than a year. I signed up right after they opened. In July 2015 they offered a lower rate if I signed a year contract. Signed the year contract and was billed the wrong amount 2 months in a row. Contacted the gym multiple times and never got a call back. Now they're claiming they can't refund me the difference or apply it to later months because they have no record of my new contract. Sounds like someone didn't know how to file the paperwork correctly. Not my problem.  I signed up for a year at the lower rate, NOT 10 months at the lower rate. They're trying to penalize me for a mistake made on their part.   Not getting any emails back...  Dealing with these people is impossible!

The iced coffee is amazing! You can tell it has been roasted with high quality beans. Full, bold flavor and no bitterness. I'll be back to try the food.

I have been dying to try this place long before it even opened. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. The person who put my toppings on my bowl was so rude! I told him two of the toppings I wanted, he added them to the bowl without saying a word and then walked away before I could ask him for wasabi and ginger. Then, a different person rang me up. I left the store and when I got home I looked at the receipt to find that I was charged for a large bowl rather than the regular size I had ordered and received. My $9 bowl turned into $13... Not cool. The bowl itself was actually pretty good, although I found it to be pretty dry. Perhaps they went light on the sauce like they did the rest of the ingredients. I think I'd rather go to a sushi restaurant up the street.
