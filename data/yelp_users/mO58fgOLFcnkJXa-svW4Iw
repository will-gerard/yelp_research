We had a fabulous anniversary dinner at The Capital Grille. Everyone was so amazing in helping us enjoy our special day. We were seated at a secluded booth with an anniversary card and heart confetti on the table.   We started with the signature calamari, always a favorite. My husband enjoyed the classic Caesar salad with shaved Parmesan and crunchy croutons while I enjoyed the spinach salad with large pieces of bacon, feta, mushrooms and purple onions. At Robbie, our waiters recommendation, I ordered the special, a 16 ounce bone in filet. I have never seen this on a menu before. WOW! It was superb. We finished the evening with a cappuccino and an anniversary dessert plate. We recommend The Capital Grille for any special occasion.  We will be back again soon.

The food was delicious, as always however the service was terrible. I made a reservation for 7 and indicated it was my Mother-in-laws birthday. The waitress was uninterested and only checked in to take our order. The bar guy was engaging, but we expected a lot more from our dining experience. For $400+ dinner for 7, we look for much better service. No one even acknowledged the special occasion until we were leaving. The bus boy was nice. Disappointed overall.

The service was terrible and the burgers were average. We had to ask for napkins, utensils and the check. If you do go, spend a little more for a pretzel bun. The regular bun crumbled and we had to use a knife and fork to finish it.
