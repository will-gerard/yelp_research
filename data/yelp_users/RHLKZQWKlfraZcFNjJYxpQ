This is, quite possibly, the most beautiful, well-maintained, and still budget-friendly apartment complex in Phoenix. We lived here for two years and have loved every minute of it. The three-bedroom apartment is spacious and all maintenance requests have been resolved in hours. The staff is always friendly and happy to help.

Thai for me is one of those cuisines that can be hit or miss. I mean, any time you need to specify how spicy the food should be and they still typically under shoot doesn't get my respect. Krua Thai Cuisine at 16th Street and Bell, however, is the best I have had in a very long time.  The food was fantastic, there were great prices, and a lot of choices. I think we will be back often to give other dishes a try.

I love small hole-in-the-wall family restaurants, and this is one of those gems. Wonderful old restaurant with good food and the staff was delightful.

It seems like the Wagon Yard has been around forever, yet we made our first visit there about a week ago.  The waitress (I didn't catch her name) took great care of us. She noticed immediately that what I was ordering was painfully diet/limited and she catered to me without blinking, made sure my salad didn't have croutons, etc. The food was very good with great specials.

I went to Liberty Market for the first time last Friday to hang out with friends at the latest #evfn. I have to say I was very impressed with the place and the staff. They took excellent care of a very large crowd. Since I wasn't really hungry, I just glanced at their pastries, but what a gorgeous sight. I picked a blueberry scone which was large, not terribly expensive, and a soda. The scone was wonderful and I savored it the whole evening. I would definitely go back if #evfn touches down there again, but more importantly, I would trek back down into Gilbert again to try something else to enjoy.

I came to the restaurant specifically because of a recommendation. I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.  However, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)  So I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.  When my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.  The waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.  As a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.  A fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.  The waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.  I do not intend to go back.

Arriba Mexican Grill is consistently good. The weekday specials make it even better. You can't beat Taco Tuesday where regular ground beef tacos are only 99 cents. Chicken Chimichangas on Thursdays are another delicious deal at just $2.99 each. Chips, salsa, and bean dip come as soon as you sit down. The staff is friendly and fast.  If you do choose to order from the menu, there's plenty to choose from. The prices are a bit high but the meals I have had were all worth it. Do note that most sides also cost extra, which again can add up. Just be aware of this and decide if you are REALLY gonna eat that beans and rice, eh?

I have been to other 5 & DIner restaurants and enjoyed my meal, especially the one at the Scottsdale Pavillions. However, I have now had two disappointing meals at the diner at the Arizona MIlls in Tempe. Today's lunch was a terrible affair.  We arrived at about 12:30PM and there was maybe only two or three tables occupied. What we'd hoped would mean quick service was anything but. It took forever to get a waitress to take our order, and then a very long time for our meal.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (was not asked about how done I wanted it, what kind of cheese or anything -- just boom, bacon cheeseburger, NEXT) and my fiancee ordered the chicken finger appetizer.  My burger was beyond well done, and dry, but greasy from the cheese and sauces. Furthermore the burger was cold -- and not just from the lettuce. I was hungry and waited too long to bother sending it back. I choked it down with the aid of some decent fries.  M'lady's chicken fingers were mistakenly upgraded to a dinner plate, which included fries, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and gravy! So we basically paid double for an order for too much food because the waitress -- or cook -- didn't get the order right.  Overall I'm extremely disappointed by this location. I now understand why there were so few people eating there as well.

We recently moved to Mesa, just down the road from Cindy's Arizona Cafe. We have had breakfasts and lunches here. The menu has a lot of standard fare, as well as some treats one doesn't find elsewhere.  For example -- gyro meat as a breakfast meat choice. Fantastic! Also, they make french toast from cinnamon roll (bread). You MUST try that! Also, they make a Monte Cristo sandwich. The only other place around here that I know of which serves a Monte Cristo is Chompies. The one from Cindy's is simple yet fun -- ham and turkey breast (I think, or could have been pork -- I need to ask!) with cheese on french toast. Divine!  The food has been fabulous home-cooked fare and the staff is sweet and attentive. It is often busy, but the wait has never been too long. They are absolutely worth the wait.

How the mighty have fallen. Time was this buffet was plentiful with good choices. Now even the early birds have deserted this coop.   The salad lettuce was browning -- the garland around the fruit bar looked fresher. The pastas were cold except the mac and cheese which was tolerable. I think they had pizza -- it was round with a cheese-like substance on it, but I couldn't confirm for you if it had been baked. The fried chicken and fish sat in their grease, drowning slowly from neglect.  No one was at the carving stations and there were no knives to carve the roast and ham yourself. Eventually when we found someone else being served from the station, my wife and daughter formed a line, and then were treated rudely as if the carver had better things to do than serve them.  The only saving grace were the desserts. Let's just say if the ice cream machine wasn't working there would have been a riot.  Salad: 1/5 Chicken: 1/5 Mashed potatoes and gravy: 2/5 Corn and veggies: 3/5 Pizza: 1/5 Mac and cheese: 3/5 Spaghetti: 1/5 Rolls: 3/5 Ham: 3/5 Roast Beef: 1/5  Chocolate fudge/lava cake: 3/5 Strawberry/cherry cake: 3/5 Ice cream: 3/5 Rice Krispie treat: 3/5  Clean: 2/5 Service: 1/5 Fresh: 1/5

So, you really have to search to find this place... and figure out how to get into their parking lot... and find them when they are open. BUT once you get there, they have a very good sushi bar and fair prices. Their happy hour makes it even better with half-price off some sushi. This could be the best kept secret in town.

This is the best place to enjoy a steak in Tempe. This place is full of history and atmosphere as well. The rest of the food on the menu is great as well; I've had their ravioli and their fish and chips and loved it all.

The BEST spice store on the planet. It was convenient when they were in Scottsdale, but now that they are at Tempe Marketplace, I go every chance I get.  So why only four stars? Two words: crappy hours.  Folks, when you had a little store in an ignored strip mall, you could afford to be eccentric and keep bankers' hours. But you're in THE mall to be at now. Put on the big-kid pants and stay open another hour or two, please!

I don't drink much, so I'm not dazzled by what is on tap. We came here to try a local Irish pub and see how their food was.  One star is too good for this place. I had the "bangers and mash". The quotes are necessary, trust me. My wife had -- we think -- the Shepherd's Pie. If the waitress had been attentive, we'd have asked. Since we weren't guzzling fermented piss, I guess we didn't rate on her radar. At least it wasn't terribly expensive.  I doubt we'll go back.

Plenty of Japanese and fusion options, but limited sushi choices. Also no descriptions on the sushi, so unless you know what you like, you will be asking a lot of questions.  I wanted to try the cornflake shrimp but they ran out of corn flakes. That happens, I know, but still. Sad sushi eater was sad. Also, seriously, please just print one menu.

This was our first visit and we intend to come back. Often. As we are on a gluten-free diet now, Picazzo's seems to be the sole respite for us to have Italian. Except for their ravioli and baked pasta dishes, all of their pastas are quinoa gluten-free, but you can choose to have rice gluten-free instead. It is SO nice to see a restaurant that offers variety.  Their breads and croutons are ALSO GF! (We almost didn't believe them when they said that the bread that came with our pasta was GF! It was delicious!)  For pizzas they offer a medium size as gluten-free. We chose to try their pasta tonight but will return to try their GF pizza next time. Apparently they have a soy-free, dairy-free mozzarella cheese as well. THANK YOU! Again, we'll come back to try that.  They were crazy busy on a Friday night, as expected, but it was totally worth it. The chocolate chip skillet cookie with coconut vanilla ice cream was superb! I believe all of their desserts are GF also.  If I can make a suggestion to the restaurant, I would love to see their GF pizza crusts in different sizes, and I would also love to see a "choose your own" pasta option as well.

This was our first time at CPK. I was craving a thin crust pesto pizza. They lured us in with fried mac & cheese. The pizza was good and larger than I expected for a personal pizza, yet still not proportional to the price IMHO.

I can't say enough good things about this Farmer's Market. It is worth a visit every Saturday morning. When it is really hot out, we either hit it early or skip it, but we do try to visit often. I won't mention any vendors by name, because vendors change or don't always attend. I will say, there are choices in gluten-free goods, vegan needs especially thanks to all of the fresh produce, and great ready made meals to sample. If you are near the Paradise Valley Mall area on a Saturday morning, make sure you come by and check it out. There's not a lot of parking at the park itself, but you should be able to find a spot that isn't too far away.

This sports bar is the king of the lunch special. Good choices and good prices. My only complaint is that the service is slow. If you go for lunch expect your whole lunch hour to be sapped. But, the food is tasty, the drinks are cold, and the price is right.

Best sushi in Tempe, great japanese dishes as well. The prices are remarkably fare for the quality. They are also nearby so I don't have to drive far for good food. If you have a big party, or just a starving group, you HAVE to have the Love Boat! A wooden boat with everything great from the menu neatly and gratuitously piled on. (How do you say "Bon Appetite" in Japanese? Best I can manage is "Allez cuisine" from Iron Chef but ironically that is still French. LOL)  But let's face it, there are two things on the menu that keep my wife and I coming here: The Gold Rush Roll (tempura fried California Roll with Eel Sauce! -- You know, just take possibly the healthiest thing on the menu and DEEP FRY IT!) and the Tempura-fried Green Tea Ice Cream. (See a pattern here?)  It's all good and if you can catch a happy hour you will save even more cash. A word of warning though, this place is ALWAYS busy. Hmmmm... can't imagine why.

First, I'll start by saying that the food, once I was served, was good. Nowhere near worth the price. Certainly not worth the wait.  The only reason I came by here was that they have a sign proclaiming that they are mostly gluten-free. I walked in, the place is empty, and I waited quite a while before anyone bothered to come out and seat me, without a menu. Eventually the waitress brought me out pita bread with onions. I asked her if the pita bread was gluten-free and she told me of course it wasn't.  Now, I figured this, however, if your restaurant is proud to be gluten free, and hangs a sign outside to encourage customers seeking gluten-free foods then a) you should ask first before you bring out (not counting desserts) the main item of food that ISN'T gluten-free out to your customer and b) don't be rude to your customer. Look, you just basically waved something delicious that I miss in front of me and in effect said "too bad you can't have this."  Getting past that, I was finally given a menu, and PLENTY of time to decide what I wanted. I ordered the Chicken Filet Sultani, which is chicken kabob with a ground meat koobideh kabob.  The koobideh was good, the chicken was kind of tough. Not dry, but maybe overdone.   I then also had to wait for the waitress to come around for me to pay the bill. I just dropped cash and left.  If you are craving Persian food and you are in North Scottsdale, do not go to Pars. Get back onto Frank Lloyd Wright and drive west until you get to Scottsdale Road, then go north a little way and enjoy The Persian Room.

I've been here twice so far and I like the place. The first time I had the italian beef and sausage combo sandwich with Cheezy fries. Score on both of those, but way too much food.  Second time I had just an italian beef sandwich with garlic parmesan fries and I was less impressed. The garlic parmesan fries are a joke compared to the artery destroying cheezy fries as they just just their crinkle fries sprinkled with garlic powder and a little canned parmesan cheese. I'll get the velvety cheezy awesome drowned fries again next time.  The beef in the sandwich on the second visit was a bit dry as well. Sure the bread was greasy and juicy but that can't really make up for it. Perhaps the sausage brought extra noms to the party. Maybe it was just a bad day the second time.  They do get extra points for having RC Cola which just totally made both meals even better than the usual fountain soda fare.  Italian Combo sandwich: 5/5 Cheezy fries: 5/5 Italian Beef sandwich: 3/5 Garlic Parmesan Fries: 2/5  Clean: 5/5 Service: 5/5

English is ironically an inadequate language to describe how wonderful this British pub is. I have eaten almost everything this chippie offers and it has always been great. The fish is outstandingly fresh, crispy, and perfectly cooked. Even the Steak and Kidney Pie, though humble, should not be missed.  Apparently there is some kind of "football" tournament going on now that has people excited and they all rather fancy watching it here. If kicking back a cold one while watching men kick a ball sounds like fun, then this is definitely your place.  Also, don't forget to visit their "expat shop" as I like to call it -- a section devoted to all of the tasty treats from across the pond.  I never knew the joy of a dolly mix until I found all of their sweets.

This restaurant and store are worth the trip from other far flung parts of the valley. We came here with friends on a trip to visit Queen Creek. It seems everything served here is locally sourced, which is wonderful. I'm not even a huge fan of olives, but they have an enormous selection of oils, tapenades, and more from the store. (Their chocolate infused olive oil is an incredible flavor that you should try.)  The restaurant serves sandwiches, soups, small appetizers, gelato, and pizza. We ate quite well and shared many different plates. Everything was good.  I don't know that I'd drive an hour on a regular occasion to enjoy the food or buy from their store, but if ever I am back in the area, I'll probably make it a point to swing by again.

Red Robin is always a fun, family-friendly place to grab a burger. Their new menu has made it even better. The only reason I can't give them five-stars is because *sometimes* their service is hit-or-miss.

They get five stars now. You know why? Three little words I long to hear: Gluten-Free Buns! (OK, technically that's two words, but I love them nonetheless!)  The buns are a dollar extra, but if you are like me and are tired of eating a burger with a lettuce wrap, or worse, with cutlery, just for the illusion of a sense of normalcy, they are worth it. And, frankly, quite tasty.  I don't know if all RR are serving them now, or from the same bakeries/distributors, but I for one am glad for it!

Score one for the small businesses. I stopped in here with my wife for lunch. She had the California Roll and I gave the Surprise Roll a try. We also shared some fried Gyoza potstickers.  The CA roll was pretty standard, but the Surprise Roll earned it's name! This is a CA roll with Shrimp Tempura topped with avocado and three sauces: spicy sauce, eel sauce, and a white sauce that I would bet is just mayo. This was remarkably good, though I could do without the mayo and would have liked a maybe spicier touch. I would have this again. The Gyoza was pretty standard too, but quite good. This topped us off just fine.  Gyoza: 3/5 California Roll: 3/5 Surprise Roll: 5/5  Clean: 4/5 Service: 4/5

We will be back. We barely scratched the surface of this place, but we loved everything we ate. This is the best bang for your buck buffet, Bubba.  The very best thing is their Pan-seared Seafood which is prepared at its own station. I had tilapia on a bed of linguine with scampi sauce and it was cooked perfectly. They also had a choice of scallops or shrimp, with either a bed of veggies or rice, and either lemon piccata sauce or spicy alfredo.   Me Pan seared tilapia on linguine with scampi sauce 5/5 Garlic cheese biscuit 5/5 Green beans 4/5 Corn 4/5  Wife Clam chowder 5/5 Salisbury steak 5+/5 Bourbon chicken 5/5 Broccoli 3/5 Baked beans 5/5 Stuffing 5/5 Candied Yams 5/5 Baked sweet potato 4/5  Picky daughter Rotisserie chicken 4 Mac n cheese 4  All of the desserts we tried were a solid 4/5, but the fudge gets a 5/5 because, dude, It's FUDGE!

Sorry folks, but those who give this buffet 5 stars clearly don't get out often. They had mostly comfort food, nothing special. I will admit to a decent variety, but none of it was worth driving all the way to Maricopa for. I suppose if you were here to stay or gamble then the variety might impress you. But even still, Maricopa has grown up enough that there are many other restaurants in town that I think you'd do better to eat at.  Me Chicken Fried Steak and gravy: 2/5 Fried Chicken: 3/5 Salad bar (None of the dressings were labelled): 2/5 Chow mein (beef I think, again not labelled): 2/5 Sweet and Sour chicken: 3/5 Sweet and Sour meatballs: 3/5  Amaretto cheesecake: 5+/5 (This made the whole visit not suck) Cherry tart: 4/5 Bread pudding: 5/5 Angelfood cupcake: 3/5  Wife Roast beef: 2/5 (dry even though it was carved for her) Lasagna: 4/5 Tuna salad: 3/5 Broccoli: 4/5 (yeah, she thought the broccoli was good) Mashed Potatoes and gravy: 3/5 Iced Tea: 1/5 (wouldn't normally mention the drinks, but the tea was awful) Steak rare: 5/5 Au gratin potatoes: 3/5 Pork chop: 2/5 (tough and flavorless) Salisbury steak: 5/5 Candied yams: 3/5  Lemon meringue pie (sugar free): 1/5 (just plain disgusting) White chocolate sugar free cake: 2/5 Lemon meringue pie (regular): 3/5 Carrot cake: 3/5  Service: 5/5 Clean: 3/5 (Quite possible the harshest review here because the place was just filthy. Trash on the floors, many tables not cleaned, and barely cleaned once folks were seated.)

So, first let me say that this place is hidden away. I've been to "Old Town" Scottsdale many, many times. I'm not sure how new the place is, but I don't usually mozy down this little path, and have not recently. So, it was a joy to discover it, to be sure.  I came with my daughter, and frankly we were only thirsty from being all touristy. (Hey, locals get to be touristy, too.)  The place was small and busy so we sat at the bar. Upon reviewing the menu we found what they call a "Butter Beer".  Oh. My. God. Is that good!  We had a second round it was so tasty. To describe it, I can only try calling it a butterscotch flavored soda, but that is not fair nor even sufficient. It is very sweet, but oh so good.  After that, we pondered food but the two butter beers actually topped us off pretty nicely. We'll definitely have to go back to grab a sandwich or something.

We moved to the area recently and have planned to visit Mijana many times, but only made it out tonight. We arrived just after they opened for dinner, so it was pretty empty except for a birthday party by the stage area.  The waitress was attentive and had drinks and food for us very quickly. I'm a freak about hummus and make my own pretty regularly, so I know what I like. The hummus here was absolutely wonderful; a good traditional creamy hummus.  The first batch of pita that came with it was nothing special, but the second batch was wonderful. It was hard to believe these came from the same kitchen, but I'm glad we asked for more.  My wife had the lamb shank dinner and I had the Kofta kebab, and we both agreed that our meat was delicious, but the rice was spectacular. The salad that came with the meal is always like garnish to me; good but nothing special and certainly not the star of the meal.  If I have the chance I may come back for the lunch buffet, but the dinner was great, even if a little expensive. For the lamb it seems appropriate, but kofta/kefta always seems like it should be cheaper than it is.  Hummus: 5/5 Pita: 4/5 (second serving was much better) Lamb shank dinner: 5/5  Kofta kebab: 5/5  Service: 5/5 Clean: 5/5

I have heard great things about this place from a friend of mine. When I read the previous review I was a bit worried that they were closed. I drove by today and they are open for business. Not sure what happened, but the place was busy and I decided to check it out.  They serve breakfast and lunch, and everything is home-made. Instead of a sandwich I decided to have the hummus and chicken breast.  There was plenty of food, making it well worth the price. The chicken was freshly grilled, juicy and flavorful. The hummus was wonderful. It also came with pita bread. It was all just a little too much to eat, actually.

When we came to Vegas last weekend, we made sure to take advantage of the Buffet of Buffets deal. This is a 24 hour pass at a great price to the best buffets on the Strip. We didn't get around as much as we hoped so we only hit up two different buffet restaurants: Paradise Garden at the Flamingo (where we stayed) and Le Village at Paris. We had hoped to go to Lago in Caesar's but we didn't make it.  We had lunch Saturday and Sunday brunch at Paradise Garden and both times the food was great, fresh, and we loved the view onto the Flamingo Habitat.  We had an early dinner at Le Village and all I can say is Bon Appetite! This place was amazing. We would definitely come back.  We'd wanted to try more restaurants, but even at three meals at only two restaurants this deal is worth it. If you like buffet (I know some folks don't, but I definitely do when the food is good) this is a fantastic deal that I hope stays around until our next visit.

It seems there's a big rush to be the next big "build a burrito" restaurant, like Chipotle, Qdoba, etc. They can keep their trendy B.S. because I've found the best of the best and it's just down the street from my work.  Kokopelli Mexican Grill does everything fresh and healthy with plenty of options. They have tacos, taco salads, nachos, quesadillas, and of course burritos. Their meat, salsa, and carb choices are just as varied.  8 out of 10 times I get my old standby which is the chicken burrito with a whole-wheat tortilla, black beans, rice, corn salsa, and a little cheese. This thing is huge too, folks. I often can only eat about half and will take the other half back to work with me for round two. They do however have a grande version of their burritos just in case your appetite needs to be conquered brutally.  The other times I visit get split either by having a chicken quesadilla or a shrimp burrito. When I'm watching my spending I get the lunch special which is a chicken quesadilla, chips and a drink, but it is definitely a great point of variety, too, don't get me wrong.  When money is a little more available, I'll treat myself to a shrimp burrito which I'll also add their tasty guacamole to. This thing is really fantastic and still healthy my friends!  If I have one complaint it is their chips. They aren't bad mind you just boring. Even their great salsas and guacamole have a difficult time bringing joy to them. Because of this, I have not yet had their nachos. Maybe someday, but with all of the other choices, I'll happily abstain for now.

If I could give a place 6/5 stars, that would be this restaurant. You know those times when you want take out and you want Chinese food but you could be swayed towards sushi, or even maybe even Hawaiian? Go to this place and just stare are the MANY menu boards. It's all good. I've had their sushi (Tiger roll is my current favorite here), their chinese combo lunch plates (which are outrageously cheap), and their fried fish hawaiian combos. Everything has been great and way more food than I can eat.  Their service is great as well. They bring the food to your table if you are eating in and start you off with crispy wonton strips and sweet & sour sauce. Then your food comes, fresh from their grill, and it is just wonderful. They even offer to top off your drinks for you, and bring you anything else you need.  You could come here for lunch every day, try something new, and never run out of choices or variety. On top of that, their hours are amazing, something like 10:30 AM to 8PM. Early lunches to late dinners, and they deliver.  I can't think of anything to complain about. Maybe they could offer soup. Really. That's my wish, not even a complaint, because I probably could not eat wontons, soup, AND a dish. But I would try.  --- UPDATE - They DO have soup. It's not on their big boards but is listed on their small takeout menus. So, there you have it. It's all good!

My wife and I visited La Petite France during AZ Restaurant Week. #eatARW #eatAZ Their three course prix fixe menu selections were perfect -- nothing was unapproachable. My wife had the pear salad, the lamb ribs, and the chocolate creme brulee. I had the shrimp casserole, chicken marsala, and the tarte tatin.  We both enjoyed the meal very much and shared dishes so that we could try as much as we could. I think we both agree that the potatoes that came with her lamb were overdone. She also thought the spice rub on the lamb was a bit heavy-handed, but I thought it brought a brightness to the lamb.  I think if we had any real complaint it might be that the servings seemed small. Perhaps in order to fit three courses into $33/person. We would order them again, though, and I think we'd also go back to try their crepes.  Our young waiter was a lot of fun and took very good care of us as well.

Spent too long explaining my order, correcting the cashier while the manager yelled to the back our order incorrectly. Then we still did not get our order as asked. Only one of the two soda fountains worked with a low ice machine. None of the tables were clean.

Great chips and salsa. Great menu of taco choices and decent prices. The street tacos are small so you will want at least two. But with the variety to try you may not be able to decide!  Me Chips: 4 Salsa: 5 Grilled shrimp taco: 5 Fried fish taco: 4  Wife Shrimp and scallop on fried bread: 4 Scallop taco: 4 Devil with a Red Dress on margarita (Blood orange and acai): 5  Clean: 5 Service: 5

OMFG The food here is outrageously delicious and fairly priced for the unique ways they present the humble burger.   Also, save room for dessert -- specifically their Maple Bacon Milkshake.

Dinner and a movie? How about both!   The food is great, but it is very expensive. The convenience factor makes it worth some bump in price, but I think it could be a bit cheaper. The staff is very fast and unobtrusive once the film is shown.  I loved the seating and haven't had any problems with uncomfortable seats. I could understand problems with young kids staying seated.  Having said that, I think that the customers need to know that it is still best to stay quiet. Some folks seemed to feel that food and movie = talking allowed. They were quieted eventually by the staff and I appreciated that.  If you are skittish to try at first, give the matinee a go. Afraid you won't get a good seat? You can make reservations!

Great pizza by the slice any time of day. The lunch special is worth it as well. My favorite pizza is their White Pizza. Just perfect. They do have gluten-free crusts as well, so that is a bonus. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is their price for a whole pie. It's a bit high. Great fresh pizza is hard to find, granted, but -- and forgive me please -- but it is PIZZA. I will never understand how prices can vary in pizzerias. Some are outrageous, some are outstandingly cheap. Isa's borders on the higher side.

A curious place to be sure. On my first visit, the staff was shorthanded and busy. No one explained how the service worked or how much each plate cost. (I later discovered the following: yellow plates = $1, green = $1.50, blue=$2.) I was relieved to discover my tiger roll (blue plates, 4 pieces each) was only $2 each. The waitress did have GF tamari, but did not bring it out for about 10 minutes, and took longer to catch her for my bill.  On my second visit, the waitresses were available, quick to help. The food is tasty and very inexpensive.   So all told, the carousel makes trying something new easy and fast, and you can't beat the price, but you have to be persistent on getting your waitress.

Here's a tip, don't eat here. The food was bland and cold. The cheese in the cheese enchilada wasn't even melted. It was a tortilla full of cold shredded cheese. Also, the refried beans were awful -- I've had instant refried beans that held their consistency better.  We waited 20 minutes for this "food", and there were only three other occupied tables.  Also, this is the only place I've ever been to that when you order "chips and salsa" puts the salsa ON the chips. If you can call it salsa -- chopped tomato and onion with cilantro barely even qualifies as Pico de gallo, it sure as hell isn't salsa. But thanks for making my chips soggy.  This is the first Filiberto's I've been to. I'll try another just to rule out one pathetic location. But I'm never going back to this one.

I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at the Salty Sow in North Phoenix. I arrived during Happy Hour, but I was immediately drawn to two items not on the HH menu. First was the Bacon & Gruyère Crusted Bone Marrow. This was fantastic. I could have just eaten that all night. Yet there was an item on the specials menu that I couldn't pass up: Porchetta Cuban Panini.  Now, I believe there is only one perfect sandwich on this planet: The Cubano Mixto. Salty Sow's Panini sandwich is a very tasty homage to this heavenly pressed sandwich of pork, ham, cheese, pickles, and mustard. They also added onions, but this can be forgiven. ;-) What made this sandwich amazing was their use of the porchetta and un-cured ham. As a special item, I didn't know how often they featured it, and I am very glad I tried it.  The sandwich also came with their famous Duck Fat Fries. On this, I have to admit I don't understand why everyone raves about them. Are they delicious? Oh most definitely. Best pommes frites I think I've had. But that's sort of my point. They are just fries. Duck fat seems to bring nothing but maybe some extra crispiness to them. If you didn't tell me they were fried in duck fat, I'd think they were just fries. So, while very tasty, and unique as a side dish, I think this is really a novelty that one could eat once and then move on. In contrast, others might think the bone marrow is a novelty, but I would disagree and insist that they are worth the trip to Salty Sow alone.  So, after two regular prices items, the bill was hefty. More than I'd usually pay, however both items were great and unusual so I can't fault them.  I really only have ONE complaint: their hours. I'm only half-joking. They don't open until 4:30 PM. I have lived in this area almost two years and I have only just been to the restaurant for the first time tonight, because every time I've driven by until now, they have been closed, or very busy. Please, consider opening for lunch. Serve your Happy Hour menu as Lunch specials and I think everyone would be ecstatic. I know I would be.

Bink's Scottsdale is a wonderful restaurant tucked into the corner of a small mall. My wife and I came for the appetizer and stayed for lunch. The app in question was the Sweetbread nuggets. These golden-brown delights were cooked to perfection and paired with a great sweet & sour sauce.  My wife had the Chicken Salad sandwich which she enjoyed. I had the Ham sandwich which was also very good. Both sandwiches came with fresh pickles and great dipping sauces for the accompanying fries. A very delightful lunch.  We hope to try dinner soon and visit some of Binkley's other valley restaurants.

Holy cow was that good food! We just moved back to the East Valley and discovered this huge hot dog / Italian Beef / Burger place on the "outside" corner of Tempe Marketplace. I love Italian Beef so I had their Combo with Extra Gravy. OH MY GOD! I'm coming back to try everything on the menu, but I may end up just getting the Combo again. Because meat party in my mouth!
