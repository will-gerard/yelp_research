I've been a fan of AZ Tips & Toes Scottsdale location for a while but was so excited to find this other location!! It's a lot less busy and all of the nail technicians are extremely nice. I'm always impressed with the quality of their work and never leave this salon disappointed! I've been a loyal customer for all 4 years of my college experience :)!

I was honestly expecting a sketchy office but the facility she works in is so nice and trendy! They offer you coffee or water which was nice! Jackie was extremely professional and made me feel at ease. I had my appointment at 10:30 this morning and got the natural thin/lash enhancements on my top and bottom lashes. I showed her a few pictures of exactly what I wanted and she delivered. I was really scared about the pain but she did a 2 step numbing process and didn't begin until I was 100% numb. I honestly couldn't feel anything aside from a small part by (not on) my tear duct .  She worked quickly and was extremely steady. I barely have any swelling or discomfort and attached pics. I'll update once they're healed!

Super overpriced. Spent SIXTEEN DOLLARS on two drinks that were lackluster. Coconut mango lime slush was okay. I ordered an XL pistachio milk tea and it had no pistachio taste whatsoever...extremely watered down and lukewarm due to the thin layer of ice that melted minutes after leaving. Extremely disappointed and it took everything in my being to not turn around and demand a refund. Stick to basic flavored and you should be fine. Don't waste your time getting a large or XL it's not worth it.
