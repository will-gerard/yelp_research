Good place for a very nice dinner.  We went for an anniversary and they really impressed us!  Guys, make sure they know it is your anniversary when you make the reservation.

Hal is a Notre Dame grad, but I still think he is great!  He runs a solo office, has been practicing for 40+ years, and knows his business well.  He has helped me with business entity and our personal estate plan.  His fees are reasonable and reflect that fact that he has low overhead and no large corporate entity to support!  If he cannot help you he can point you in the right direction.

I go here all the time because it is close. I politely but firmly tell them the was I want. If the windshield vampires swarm I tell them I don't have glass coverage. I usually end up with a clean car at a fare price.

I have not had a need for Chiropractic services but I did "try" them for their acupuncture treatment of allergies. I went in there to see if acupuncture could help with my seasonal allergies. I had a few sessions and was very impressed with how professional and smooth their process is. I also, loved staying off the drugs and having no noticeable allergy symptoms! Pretty cool.   I just love a small business that has their act together!

I have a very reliable auto and typically go in for oil changes. They do check things over when it is in there an let me know when things like, oh, your alternator bolt is missing. Good catch, better to find out in the shop then on the road.   The lesson i have learned is that the basic oil change becomes a nightmare event for too many people when, the plugs are not properly replaced, filter not properly replace, wrong filter (transmission) changed, fill cap not replaced... i have heard lots of bad stories from people who take their cars to the chain quicky lube.

For me, the verdict is still out on UBUNTU and open source software but these guys are quick and good and priced better than anyone else i have found.  Ok, the Linux stuff is growing on me.

This is some very good Mexican.  Maybe my favorite in the Phoenix area.  I think the slow cooked pork is the deal.

Best Thai food in the valley.  I have been to others with better pad thai and better tom yum soup, but try the drunken noodles or the pad prik king - nice.

I really enjoy stopping by for a sandwich at lunch time.  Not sure what it is about the place, the food is good, the price is good, and it feels like a small mom and pop business you want to support.  No wow moments just a good lunch spot for a meeting or to stop in for a quick bite.  Parking in the back is a bit tight but I always find a spot.  I have not figured out to call in an order yet but it usually takes 3 min to get my sandwich so I haven't felt the need. I think these types of places are much more fun than the chain stores!

Tribe is a great shop with a fantastic staff. The selection is pretty incredible, catering to beginner to serious cyclist and triathletes. They are great for service, repair, and warranty issues I have had.   The core group has been there for a few years and seam to really enjoy their work which makes for nice people to interact with.   Kevin the owner is over the top, never approach him unless you are caffeinated and ready, the man knows bikes. Andreas, Diana, and Alan are very low key know there stuff and will go out of there way to take care of you.  I have had less experience with the others but have nothing bad to say about them.  Hands down, go there if you have bike business!

Wow.  This is not the old dentist that you have been going to for years. The gang at SD is fun and efficient, but really spend the time to make sure your chompers are in good condition. If you have thought about cheating on that dentist you have been seeing forever, this is the place to go.  I was just in for my second six month cleaning and appreciated the good work and fun they have in the office. My teeth have never felt cleaner!

Thom has handled my business and personal taxes for 4 years.  I was a self preparer before.  I discovered I was doing a few things incorrectly, not keeping the right records on a few things, and lastly, throughout the year as I have questions come up, Thom knows the answer and I did not!  They work with small business, audit work, payroll (they offer the payroll service) and business owner return work.  I believe they handle accounting work as well but I have not used.  Overall, nothing to worry about if you work with them.  Trustworthy, safe, experienced.

Pow, Judy makes it better.    I never feel like I have time to or money for a massage but when I go I wonder why it took so long!  She has a tidy little room where she works her magic.  She is simply fantastic!    This is not your spa or chain store massage, this is deep tissue as intense as you desire.  She has several different styles but I prefer a strait sports massage.

Troy runs the show and either does the work or brings help with him.  He not only fixes everything but gives you ideas of a better way or different way than you might have considered.  The input is valuable, the work is reliable, the price is reasonable.  If you own a home or homes, you have projects for him.  I occasionally grow tired of putting everything off and call Troy who makes everything better!

These guys are living the American dream.  They are experienced and certified pool guys who have started their own business and are doing a great job.  Very friendly and all in all, great guys.  They let themselves in and out without bothering, have a regular time so we know to expect them, and let us know when if there are any issues.  And... the pool looks as good as it ever has.

I have been working with the Hill Group for about 6 years and have personally known Doug for about 12 years.   They are brilliant, organized, knowledgeable, seasoned, and just fantastic at this business. They see more transactions than 99.9% of Realtors and the result is always more understanding and know how for their customers.   Bravo!

I just sold another investment property with the Hill Group as my listing agents.  They were excellent.  They helped me understand exactly what to fix, what to eliminate, how to stage, and how to make the property show very well.  It was a great result and a very quick close.  Happy Happy Happy!

Excellent service, good product, and great price!  I believe Jimmy came over the same day that I called and showed me some pictures, made some recommendations, and gave me a idea of price.  I discussed with the wife and got back to him within a few days.  He came back, measured, and I believe I had 3 new gates less than a week later.  Pretty much everything I hoped for!

Great Experience.  However, I brought my own 2000W Honda Generator to run it at the park.  The man who took the order expressed concern that it might not be a large enough generator.  They arrived and set up the castle and when i started the blower it tripped the generator circuit 3 times.  I called to see if it was still possible to rent a generator and it was not.  The man was very helpful suggesting some things to try and that home depot will rent generators.  His suggestion to to start the blower fan by turning it on an off to let the fan build up speed before switching it on and leaving it on.  It Worked!!! Whew.  Anyway, not their fault i tried to use an undersized generator.   They were extremely courteous, easy to work with, and especially helpful in my time of need.

Amazing shop with some beautiful toys!  The new shop looks like the lobby of the Four Seasons.  This is not my regular bike store.  I had a problem that another bike shop could not fix so they suggested Bicycle Haus and I gave it a try.  Craig called with updates as they went through everything and they were able to isolate the problem and also suggest a change that really improved the shifting and overall ride experience.  Not sure if this was an isolated occurrence but I was extremely impressed.  They went above and beyond and I could not have been more pleased.
