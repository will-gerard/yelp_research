I am not giving the store directly a 1 star but the corporation as a whole!! Foot Locker claims they gives a 20% military discount but what they don't tell you is that they only off it to active duty service members oh and you have to go on to a website and provide all types of proof a ID card is no longer enough! Oh and those of us who serve in The National Guard and Reserves our service does not mean a thing to them!!

The ensalada de zocalo was AMAZING!! Great healthy alternative at a great Mexican place! The atmosphere is cozy and very welcoming. Jaime was my server gave great recommendations!! Chips and salsa by far the BEST!! My friend had the chile verde burrito OMG this burrito is a MUST  HAVE!! Server informed me that they have  half off appetizers and drink specials! We will definitely be back!!

Stopped in here for lunch!! What a great little spot in downtown Chandler! Fresh tortillas just like my Nana makes!! Roman was super nice and have great customer service! The place was busy and a little hectic when I walked in but her greeted each guest with a smile and in fact knew just about everyone that walked in!!

This place is a dive bar but kinda cute during Christmas!! My husband and I were there with a large group about 40 of us. Went there on a Monday afternoon around 3pm! The place is really cool especially with all the Christmas decorations! I really wanted to like his place but service always plays a huge huge role in my reviews! The bartender was extremely rude and the security guy was even worse! Every time one of us went up to order a drink he acted as if we were bothering him??!! The security had the nerve to say to a very large group of customers on a Monday mid afternoon "You guys need to move the fuck outta the way!" I was in such shock when I heard that!! Seriously on a Monday afternoon when you normally would be dead the two of you are treating your paying guests like that!!  I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!! What these guys didn't realize is that this very large group was all family members of a locally owned restaurants who has been very very successful by treating their guests with the upmost respect!!

I have been coming here for years and I have to say most of the smoothies are good here. The last two times I have been here the guys working behind the counter are too busy talking with either their regulars or friends visiting them. Today the smoothie I got was so sweet and not even what I asked for I was super disappointed. The guy who helped me was not even paying any attention to what he was doing because he was too busy talking to someone. When I walked up to the counter he didn't even stop his conversation to help me instead took a brief pause and raised his voice just enough  so I could hear can I help you. I gave him my order and as he finishes my smoothie walks out from behind the counter still talking to his buddy and proceeds to hand me my smoothie I smurked a little and then he realized he didn't even charge me. Wow! I don't expect people to roll out the red carpet but come on really a little attention to the customer and what you are doing would be much appreciated! I will not be coming to this location any longer!

I had the Greek salad pita it was fantastic.  I have to say that I was not a big fan of how large the cucumbers were sliced but that didn't take away from the flavor! The staff was very nice and the place is very clean!

My husband and I have been here twice now and I really wanted to like this place but I have yet to find anything great about it other than it's a healthy option.  The bowls are over loaded with rice or noodles they charge 1.30 each to add a 2oz serving of vegetables and the sauces just have a very weird flavor I can't explain.  The staff was semi friendly. I have to say I don't think I will be back!

Cool new spot in Scottsdale! The new owners have really changed things up a bit! Come in with the family and ask for their new children's interactive place mats!  Keep the kids busy while you watch the game and enjoy a great burger!

My daughter and I created our own chicken pita with Pita Bistro signature PB dip! The food was full of flavor the marinade they use for the chicken is simply awesome all of the fixings have their own special touch and flavor that leave your mouth wanting more! The place is very modern with great music upbeat staff and everyone is leaving this place with a smile!!  We didn't have a chance to try their juices or smoothies but will definitely be back to add that to our order the next time!  Looks like they will have a full bar here shortly with some happy hour specials! CAN NOT WAIT!  I definitely give this 5 star plus!!

I would give them 6 more stars if yelp would allow it! Pita Bistro catered a wedding rehearsal dinner for my family last week! The restaurant staff was very very attentive, and went out of their way to add extra decorations and garnish! Pricing by far beat any local restaurant in the valley!! We ordered gyro, chicken kabobs, salads, and hummus the potions sizes were filling for all of the guests and the staff even packaged it up nicely so that we were able to warm it in the oven the next day!! THANK YOU PITA BISTRO!

I had the chicken fajita rice bowl with creamy white rice. The food was EXCELLENT! Chips have a bit of a lime zest to them and very fresh taste! The chef even came out to ask us how our food was!! The place is very modern inside staff is very friendly and although they were busy we got our food rather quickly! Looks like a great place to come for happy hour! We will be back!
