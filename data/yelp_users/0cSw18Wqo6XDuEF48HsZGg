Best cleaners EVER! I have literally been a customer here since Larry and Andrea took over, so about 20 years. I wouldn't go anywhere else! They are amazing and their customer service is top notch! If I do have an issue, they are always quick to fix the issue and make sure I'm happy. They typically go above and beyond! I can't say enough great things about this place. I love them!

I would have previously given them a 5 star rating, however due to the recent events that have occurred at the rental property where I'm a tenant they have dropped to a 1 star if that even. I realize that some decisions cannot be made by KRK solely and that the owner must be involved but the horrible lack of communication from KRK and the feeling that they were constantly fighting me at every turn regarding valid issues has completely turned me against them. I feel that they do not have the tenants best interest at heart, even a multiple year tenant like myself. It's all about money and bottom lines and doing things the cheapest way they possibly can even if that means doing things wrong or against code. I can't even begin to express how utterly disappointed I am with this firm. I will NEVER recommend them or use them again after we leave this property for any rental needs.

Great place! Kristy is an amazing stylist and her prices are really reasonable. The salon itself was very clean and neat. I've had several services from her now and every one was awesome! I highly recommend her!!
