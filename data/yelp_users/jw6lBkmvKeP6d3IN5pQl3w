This shuttle was a lifesaver. I wish I knew it existed hours before when I was in somewhat of a bind, but I'm glad I finally learned about it and was able to book immediately. They took me from Phoenix to Flagstaff for 45 bucks and in about two hours flat. Not bad! My experience was fine - the shuttle was running late though, which was a little nerve wracking since I was at a kind of sketchy bus stop by myself for about an hour. But they did indeed finally pick me up and I got to Flag safely.   The shuttle is essentially a 12 passenger van with a trailer attached. Definitely go-to transportation for NAU students. I fell asleep, woke up, and was in Flagstaff... cold, confused, now searching for late night Ubers, but at least in the right city. The experience was overall pretty pleasant and I would definitely recommend it for students or travelers, especially those flying through PHX. I actually saved money by taking the shuttle and renting a car in Flag instead of in Phoenix, despite the cost of the ride. Who knew?  Definitely make this your option if you need a ride in AZ.

Oh, man, SWA at PHX, you have issues!  Is it a lack of employees? Overbooking? Or the airport? All I know is while every other airline was dealing with customers efficiently, Southwest had a line that got so long it took an hour just to check in. And then security on top of that. They had to create one inital line that turned into two lines, one for boarding pass printing and one for people who already had passes. I had my mobile version but guess what line still went faster? The one for antiquated people who hadn't printed their passes. Why - because they were redoing passes for people who already had them "just in case." Le sigh...  I'm so glad I was early. Four hours early. Well, three by the time I finished checking my bag.  I forget that SWA is a budget airline and you get what you pay for. I waited for hours, flew through Las Vegas (an hour to the northwest when I was trying to go southeast) and did other various annoying things because I got a cheap fare. They even changed the gate 10 mins before boarding with no announcement. The flight attendant didn't know about it and was late boarding because of it.   My loyalty to Southwest is constantly being tested. I can't wait til I have enough disposable money to fly a different airline!

I am very lucky to be both close to the Mayo Clinic and in-network with my health insurance. Logically, this is where I wanted to go when a health issue came up. I don't think I have ever been to such a top-notch facility. They excel in every regard: customer service, friendliness, wait times, patient care and of course research/knowledge.   The building is located on a pretty large campus between Scottsdale and Fountain Hills. The surroundings are beautiful, with nature trails and climate-appropriate plants (I always wondered why anyone in Phoenix would bother with grass!). The buildings are clean, visually appealing and adorned with artwork. The people working here, from the front desk people to the experienced doctors, are patient and compassionate. It says something that there is a hotel next door where out of towners stay just to get an appointment. It also says something that I waited 3-4 months to be seen... But once you're established in a department, you can make appointments more quickly. I also think it's awesome that data from my visits can be used for research purposes.  The only complaint I could possibly have is that scheduling isn't easy if you work a 9-5. You may have to take whatever you can get. But it's worth it to have a pleasant experience and piece of mind. I will definitely keep coming here if I need anything in the future.

I'll echo the 5 star reviews here: this dry cleaners is great. The owner and her staff are friendly, efficient, and professional.   In the past, I've never needed clothes dry cleaned on a regular basis, so I never had a go-to place. With my current job, I have to dry clean more often, so it was a relief to find a dependable cleaners close to home without any trial and error. My clothes always look great and the turnover is just 24 hours. It's an added bonus that I don't have to worry about how much they're charging me since the prices are very fair.  I encourage everyone in the north Tempe/south Scottsdale area to support this small business. You will be happy that you did!

This isn't a hotel, it's a motel. And not a nice one even by La Quinta standards. It reminds me of the kind of motel you would go to with a prostitute. In fact, it probably is.   The room was kind of dirty - wet carpets, stained sheets. No cable. The room offered loud street noises (check in guy said I would hear no noise, that wasn't true). I found cigarette butts in the windowsill despite being a non-smoking room.  Check out woman was super rude and wouldn't speak to me even after I said thanks three times to see if she would respond. She stared me straight in the eyes with a bitch face and I seriously deserve an award for not flipping the bird as I walked away.  Don't be fooled by the proximity to the airport like I was. No airport shuttle. No business accomodations. This isn't a hotel for travelers or business people, if you get what I'm saying.

This is quickly becoming a go-to lunch place. It's right around the corner from my job, and guaranteed to be delicious. They cater to the busy working lunch crowd, given the proximity to SRP and all the other businesses nearby. Despite the constant traffic of hungry professionals, the line always moves quickly and the people working here are pretty nice and/or funny.   Try a wrap and get it grilled/pressed like a burrito. So good! And the cookies are to DIE FOR!! I find myself wanting to run by just to get a soft white chocolate macadamia cookie all the time. But then I end up getting a sub too... and maybe another cookie for the road... this is why I can't be thin.  I'll be here again soon! COOKIES

In-N-Out was the first place I tried in Tempe, and has been a favorite ever since. Truth be told, I wasn't even really into burgers before I tried them, and now I'm a convert. I go there when I feel like I need a treat (pretty often) and have brought several visitors from out of town for their "must have" meal. The food is fresh, quick, and filling. I love the retro feel and friendly service and quick lines always make it a positive experience.  My favorite thing is the shake - but burgers seem to be the most popular item for obvious reasons. A double double and some fries (animal style is what most people like) is sure to make any hungry person a much more happy camper. Don't miss this place! Just go!

Urgent care is great because sometimes you get sick and who really wants to wait days, even weeks, for appointments? So I have been here twice now for a nagging illness that can resurge with a vengeance and put me out of commission. I usually schedule an appointment online and basically get in line to be seen before I even get there, which is super convenient. It's covered by my insurance and I pay a nominal copay. Works well for me.  I do question the quality of care, as I've never been seen by the PA for more than a minute or two. Perhaps I do need to see a general practitioner, but when it comes to instant gratification, urgent care works, and I have no real qualms with this location. My one suggestion is that they give you your paperwork when you make your online appointment, so that the process can be sped up, and it doesn't all have to be done when you get there. Ultimately though, I would go here again if I needed immediate care.

I might go to Tempe Marketplace a little too often. My favorite anchor store is of course Target, but depending on how I want to blow my paycheck I cycle through Nordstrom Rack, DSW, Cost Plus, Barnes & Noble, H&M, Ross and of course Petsmart. They're always playing fun rock music in the parking lots, and the vibe is upbeat, safe, and fun. Could make a nice date location too.  As mentioned in other reviews, the parking lot is super confusing. It's like a neighborhood with different streets and multiple random entrances. The four way stops can be brutal during busy times and I've almost collided with other cars on a few occasions. Look before you turn here! And be safe as a pedestrian. It's very walkable, but the traffic is always heavy and people can be impatient.  If they added a grocery store (I know it would make traffic even worse) Tempe Marketplace would be golden.

I'm a big fan of the National Park Service and anything managed under this agency, from National Parks and Monuments to historic properties and recreation areas. The main reason is that the NPS is extremely dog-friendly and in Arizona at least, they have adopted measures to make it easier for people to enjoy the parks with their pets - rather than leaving them in the car. This means allowing dogs at the site and even sometimes letting them inside. I brought my pup here recently and in typical NPS form, we both felt welcome!  The ruins are pretty cool. I enjoyed learning about the Hohokam and their engineering marvels in Arizona, from the irrigation canals to the network of living and working spaces. This site has been well-preserved, but it hasn't been easy. The story of the preservation work over the past 120 years is fascinating and explains why it looks the way it does (they used brick and concrete to repair things at various points in time).   I remain amazed by Arizona's geological and archeological wonders every day! This is a must-see half day trip from Phoenix or Tucson especially if you are a local - but I plan to bring my visitors back here as well. Admission is only five bucks... another one to put on the National Parks annual pass (so worth the money)!

I paid $419 for two weeks of rental car. Yeah... enough said. Thank you, contracted rates!   Despite the slight inconvenience of the rental companies being located outside the airport, the return at Avis was so quick and easy. Park, scan, done! No lines or customer service reps.   Me after parking: "Where should I go now?" Avis guy: "Go home." Me: "Ok"  I jumped on the shuttle to the airport just minutes after dropping off my car. What a nice experience! I can't really say the same for the other car rental places here or the Avis in Flagstaff... but this one was great.

This is a really nice outdoor mall with good options for dining and shopping for work clothes. It's conveniently located right off the 202 in Gilbert. Coming from the ASU area, it doesn't take me too long to get here. The layout is pretty simple and compact, so you don't have to walk a mile to get where you want to be. I saw a good amount of families, dogs and kids as well as individual shoppers. Parking can be scarce, but it has never been a problem for me to park close to my shopping destinations right on the street.   There are a lot of my go-to stores here: Apple, H&M, Banana, Loft, and Macy's. Some that I will never set foot in either, so something for everyone! My only qualm would be the restrooms - they're kind of hidden, and unlike the surrounding mall, not cleaned very often. This is usually more evident at night after a lot of people have been through, which makes sense. I'll definitely keep coming here.

I really wanted to like this place, with its highly-reviewed American food and cute signature steer. Unfortunately, the service was sub-par. First of all, service was slow and aloof. They were out of the nightly special (Fish & Chips), but we didn't find this out until five minutes after we ordered. Then, we had to practically hunt down the server to re-order and remind her that we were still waiting for our drinks (this is at least 20 minutes after we arrived). Contrary to the previous reviews, I didn't think the fries were as great as people said they were. The burger was OK but I've had much better for a cheaper price, nothing amazing here. And apparently you're supposed to get your soft drink in a frosty mug? Nope - more a tiny glass with a few cubes of ice (plus no refill offered when I finished it quickly). I know this place is low-key and I know the demands of working in a busy restaurant but come on.... service counts!

Friendly staff and yummy food... didn't try the smoked meat but apparently that gets rave reviews. Pizza was pretty good, but really salty (?), which was weird for a pizza. Still decent, but unless you're looking for overtly salty food I would avoid it or ask beforehand. We also liked the Halloween decorations and general inviting/casual ambiance of the place. My only complaint was the downstairs bathrooms - total dump - no mirror and one working toilet. Supposedly they are under renovation so I would just avoid altogether if you can.

Free admission... enough said! Granted, we really shouldn't complain about museum admissions. They usually need the money and it's going towards a good cause. But the whole "free" thing did attract me, and I've been trying to expand my cultural side lately, so I wandered inside.  The layout of this museum is interesting. You go down to enter and up to make your loop. Well-utilized space, for sure. While wandering around I seem to have interrupted several photo shoots, so I must have not been the only person who found the surroundings pretty darn cool. The exhibits themselves were what you would expect at a University. Pushing the limits and lamenting on the sad state of the world, I guess. I appreciate the artistic vision but I will admit several parts elicited a smirk and a "WTF." Still, really nice galleries, and I love that they have this resource for students and locals to enjoy.   Definitely check out this museum if you are looking for a quick excursion near ASU. Watch out for the overzealous security guard who may insist you are trespassing or violating some kind of rule (not sure what he was trying to nab me for as I walked from one exhibit to the next so I just kept going). Parking is out front, and not free, but it is worth it. I'll be back to check out new exhibits in the future!

I have been meaning to write a review about this amazing hotel for a few weeks now. I stayed here for several days and can say it is one of the nicest and most chic hotels I have ever been to and gave me a great impression of beautiful Montreal. The rooms were clean and elegant and the staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is well-located in the busy Centre-ville section of Montreal literally one minute from the Peel metro station and TONS of shopping. I'll let the travelers decide for themselves, but the main things I thought stood out:  1) GORGEOUS albeit small lobby with the most beautiful creative floral arrangements, changed every few days. Those things must be expensive, but they really looked amazing!   2) Super friendly hotel staff, not annoyed that we didn't speak French like some other Montreal natives we encountered. The people at the front desk as well as the doormen were so accommodating and gracious.   3) A bathroom unlike any other, as seen in some of the pictures. Instead of a wall between the shower and bedroom, there are wooden panels THAT OPEN FROM THE BEDROOM, not the bathroom. In essence, that means that someone from the bedroom can simply open them and watch someone in the shower. I imagine that could be quite romantic in some sense, but it just made us laugh and go "what the....?"  4) Beautiful little restaurant where we had breakfast and delicious cappuccinos. We were in a hurry, and they were very quick.   5) Fresh fruit in every hallway replaced daily, and a complementary food and beverage cart that visits the rooms nightly offering soda and snacks. Keurig machine and complementary k-cups for quick coffee every day. So nice and unexpected.  This hotel is a gem and a definite must if you want to stay somewhere upscale with a practically perfect location.

Yelp success story! I was referred to Cactus Tint by several yelpers who said their work was top notch. I was looking specifically for tint that would protect me from the Arizona sun as well as offer some privacy. I made an appointment here (through yelp) a few weeks in advance and I'm so happy I went through with it. Their work is impeccable and the service is great - friendly, polite, quick and professional. My windows are super dark now and I can definitely tell the difference when I'm driving. It's great to know that I'm not getting horrifically burned like I used to! The 5 star reviews don't lie... this is a business you should support!  Ginger: 1 Sun: 0

Well my last review got reported by some ahole (yeah Yelp censors can screw themselves and I'm not sorry) but I'm writing one again to say...  Bottom line: UBER in Phoenix is great! I got rides from both a black car at the airport and an UberX later in the day. Both of my drivers were very polite and helpful. One of them was even from my homeland DC!  The pick up at PHX Sky Harbor is outside the baggage claim near Door 7. Don't request your car until you are near the door because I requested on the wrong side of the room and he got there early. They're everywhere around here and the rates are awesome. Way better than a cab plus the cars smell good and the drivers speak English. No hassles, just a nice time with no cash needed.  I want to write a warning that when you use a promotional code listed below in the tips, you are using someone's personal code that earns them free rides for their own benefit. Awesome referral service on Uber's part but not permitted by Yelp. Considering Yelp allows people to create empty profiles to promote their Uber code, I posted mine as well - and my long detailed review was deleted. Leave it to yelp to target elite members and allow non-active users to prosper. If you want to use a referral code, use it from someone who you actually know or want to support, NOT a fake profile troll.  Guess what though... people used my short-lived code and I got a bunch of free rides anyway. Lol, you gotta be quicker than that! *waves a dollar*  Anyways, if you're not an UBER addict you need to become one now! Especially in Phoenix where cars are plentiful and affordable. I love this service and will definitely be using it again.

I made a mistake choosing this vet office for my dog. We're new to Arizona, so I chose Sun Devil since they were close and convenient with decent reviews. After experiencing their questionable billing practices, I can confidently say I will no longer be going here. It's a shame, because the facilities are nice and I have no personal issues with any of the staff. Although he's not particularly warm, the vet is competent and the boarding staff is friendly.  The problem here is with their billing. I can back this all up with facts. I was charged $253 for an exam, Frontline, and routine tests. My dog was not sick but I wanted to start fresh in AZ with a clean bill of health. My understanding was that all tests were included in the bill, which I paid. When I returned to drop off a fecal sample, I was charged another $49 for the fecal tests that they had supposedly forgotten on the original bill. I paid without question. Later that day, I received a phone call asking for more money: $9 for yet another test "forgotten." I asked them to bill me, they denied my request and suggested I give them my credit card number over the phone. No way. I said forget it. It felt like extortion after I had just paid a surprise bill hours earlier. My dog didn't even need the specific test (Girardia, she would be sick if she had it!).   I'm a pretty trusting person, and I usually give people the benefit of the doubt, so I decided to give the facility another chance by boarding my dog there just a few days later. As far as I know, she was treated well; however, my bill was higher than what I had agreed to on dropoff. I asked why and was told I signed up for a healthy pet insurance program. When I asked to see the paperwork where I signed off on this program, it revealed that I did not sign up and was being overcharged. They admitted this and adjusted my bill. It is unsettling thinking that I would have overpaid if I hadn't asked for proof.  Does all this sound sketchy to you? If the answer is yes, you're not alone. My family and coworkers all agree: I'm "being had." And that upsets me, because I really wanted to support them. But I can't do bait and switch every time I come for a visit and end up with a hidden fee demanded twice in the same day. I can't worry about fraudulent charges that I did not agree to every time I board.  I did express my concerns to the people there, and they can take it or leave it. I feel foolish for wanting to give them another chance. They may spin it as me not understanding their billing practices, but the facts are facts, and here they are. If you do go here, make sure you get an itemized bill and review all your charges with the front desk. As for me, I don't like being taken advantage of by a business that I am trying to support. On to the next one...

Mountain Park Health Center is a network of health centers in the Phoenix area. I chose them for an initial visit based off my insurance provider's website since they were listed as accepting new patients and most other places like the Mayo Clinic had wait times of several weeks to months. I had no idea that they focused on affordable/accessible healthcare, and I'll admit that did make me question the quality that I would be getting. However it has ended up being just fine. In fact, I wish a place like this had been available to me when I was uninsured. They treat all people with dignity and respect regardless of income or background, which everyone deserves.   The facilities at the Gateway location, which specializes in family medicine and women's health, are clean and updated. It is very easy to schedule appointments and get in and out quickly. The providers are personable and knowledgable. For now, I plan on sticking with them.

You can't go wrong with Hampton. My family has been staying at Hamptons for years in various cities across the country, and the value, service, and perks are always outstanding. This one is no exception. It is wonderfully located right on Scottsdale Road just minutes from the 202, ASU, and Old Town Scottsdale. The inside is clean and updated and the parking lot is well-lit and safe. The front desk staff were really friendly and sweet! Being completely new to Tempe, they were very helpful. The room was just fine and we had no issues. The only thing that I will never understand is trend of no dressers in the rooms. After all, there are two kinds of people: those who immediately unpack and sort their luggage, and those who leave it lying around forever, still pulling from it weeks later. I'm definitely the first type, so no place to organize clothes can be tricky. I guess I need to get with the times.  Definitely book this hotel if you're in the Tempe or Scottsdale area, on business or for a personal trip. I probably won't have the opportunity to stay here again simply because I'm moving there now (yay), but I'll definitely send my friends and family to them in the future.
