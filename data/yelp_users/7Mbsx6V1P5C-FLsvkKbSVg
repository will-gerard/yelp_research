So let me pose a question.  You go into an establishment for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  You order two of their "$6 Burgers" and two mimosas.  You get your food and drinks and you and your girl are content. Burgers are good, a little messy but its a burger so who cares.  Then as you are 3/4's through with your meal you decide that its time to take a fork to the rest of the burger and eat it that way.  So you take the bread off.  You grab your fork and take the mushrooms off and you see it...  A single curled hair in the mushrooms.  At this point I am completely done with everything.  Our server comes by and I let her know and she apologizes and says to me I will bring the check over.  She does, and doesn't even take the hair burger off the total.  So at this point I am starting to get upset and it is showing.  We get another server by the table and I tell her what happens and she looks at the plate and goes to the bar.  A couple minutes later our server comes back and tells me "we're taking $3 off your burger".  Now I am amazed I didn't say something when she said that but honestly I was more stunned than anything else.  Why would you not offer to take the entire item off of my check?  Why would I even need to ask that?  Common sense and good business do not go hand in hand.    Lets be honest, say I am two bites in and I find a hair, what would they offer to do?  Most likely they would offer to bring me a new one to which I would have declined because I do not want hair in my food and because of that I am done with my meal and have lost any semblance of an appetite.  So for them to charge me half price for a burger that had hair in it is beside me.  Its a shame to, I have a restaurant.com coupon for this same restaurant and now it will be thrown in the trash because I am completely done with this establishment and will not go back.  Way to go Thirteen North Grille for a horrible dining experience and for completely turning off a returning customer from ever wanting to support your local restaurant again.

Tonight I had one of the most enjoyable dining experiences that I can remember. After reviewing the Arizona Restaurant Week website we decided on trying something new and I am so glad that we did.   Upon walking in we were greeted and offered a table of our choosing to sit at. Since this was restaurant week there was a set menu and none of courses disappointed. We began our dinner with a glass of Wine and ordered our appetizers which were stuffed mushrooms. Two of the "crab meat delight" and two of the "angry shrimp".  These stuffed mushroom were absolutely incredible!!!!  Next up we ordered their signature Mac & Cheese ( this wasn't a part of the Arizona Restaurant Week special but honestly who can say no to Mac & cheese?). The Mac & Cheese was creamy and full of flavor. For our main courses we both had the "angry salmon" which came with garlic mashed potatoes and vegetables. The salmon was excellent,perfectly cooked with great flavor. Salmon dishes like this one will have me choosing them over a steak any day of the week. To end our meal we had our choice of desserts which like everything else this evening didn't disappoint! We ordered their gluten free pineapple upside down cake and my new favorite the peanut butter cheesecake. The pineapple upside down cake was moist and the flavors were amazing.  Upon taking my first bite of the peanut butter cheesecake I knew I would have to come back!  For a peanut butter fanatic like me I couldn't have been more pleased. Thank you to Emily, Chris and JT for their hospitality and amazing service. We were even given a tour of their patio before leaving. This will be a new spot I will frequent!!!
