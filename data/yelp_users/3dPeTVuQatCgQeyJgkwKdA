This was the place I went to with my friends when we first got into good beer. Their brews are very good and their food as well. Their fries are a little weak, just run of the mill compared to Four Peaks' beer battered fries, but other than that their menu can stand toe-to-toe with Four Peaks. What gives Four Peaks 5 stars and Sonora 4 stars is the fact that Four Peaks' beer is superior and Four Peaks has a great Sunday brunch. But do not get me wrong, this place is worth a visit... many many visits!  P.S. BEST ONION RINGS IN TOWN!

Amazing. I have been all over Europe and seen many things, and this ranks up there with anything I have ever seen. There is no way to really describe this, so I would just go see it. It is cheap and South Mountain is nice when it is cool out.

The gym itself is fine, if not a little crowded during peak hours.   However, if you need anything from the staff after you have signed up, either to change or remove a person from your account, they do not care about you at all. We cannot even remove my name from our membership, as you have to go in during specific hours (when most other people are at work) or jump through some hoops by printing something out and sending it to their corporate office. HOW ABOUT YOU STOP THE BS SCAM AND LET ME REMOVE MYSELF FROM MY WIFE'S MEMBERSHIP? In 2014, I have little to no patience with this crap. They get you in, let you join, all with no issue. Then you need to do anything to make LA Fitness a few less bucks off of your membership, and you have to move mountains.

Everything was fantastic, and though the line can look intimidating, it goes pretty quickly. I have never tried their lunch menu, but their breakfast is out of this world. Their baked goods (biscuits, muffins, ect.) are def. worth a visit just to try them out. This is one of the best breakfast joints in the Valley.

My wife had our daughter here a year ago. They were great and took the best care of us that you could ever imagine. They even had a nurse install our car seat for us... Very impressive staff in the maternity ward....

I have to agree that the happy hour here is lame. Their prices are too high, and their beer/liquor selection WAY too low. The servers are hot, the food is decent, the TV's are everywhere. If there were not other places within a few miles that have better deals, better beer selection and better food, this place would get more stars. However, it can be PACKED, so they must be doing something right...

Do not move here. Their staff stinks and could care a less about their residents. I had a major roof leak, and they would not fix it until 5 days later; meanwhile it was rainy all weekend and I had water all up in my apartment. They did not care though. That would require effort.I have many more examples I could list, but will not.   The residents of this place are half REALLY cool, and half REALLY white trash. Lots of theft and vandals. Stay away. Do not live here.

I had been wanting to try this place for a while as I read it was pretty good. I tried my BBQ favorite in the beef brisket. What a bad move on my part. Their brisket had no seasoning, no smoke flavor, was the opposite if tender, and even my mom who tried a few bites of my meal thought it tasted "old." At any decent BBQ joint you will not see any brisket left on the plate when I am done, however with this joint I could not even finish half the portion it was so bad.   On the good note, the sides were really good; I had mashed potatoes and gravy and potato salad and both were damn good. However, the brisket was SO bad that the sides could not bump this review above the one star. I do not enjoy paying over $15 for un-seasoned, non-smokey, old-tasting brisket....  On a side note, I take no joy in giving a place, especially a non-chain, locally owned joint a bad review. I tried to be as nice as possible, as I realize I only tried one item on their menu. To be honest, if their quality levels allow them to serve brisket this terrible, then I do not think I can give this place another chance. The brisket was shocking in its' badness....

First thing's first. The beer selection is great, both the bottles and the tap collection. The bar gets 4 stars for the beer selection alone.   Food: not so good. Belgian pizza is actually good, other than the pizzas the food is BOGUS. The best food here is in liquid form (the beer). Eat before or after, but I would not try much other than the pizza. I swear the wings were out of a microwave....  If the food was as good as say, 4 Peaks, this would be a 5 star review. The beer alone is enough for this place to get 4 stars though....

The cuts of meat here are so much better than any supermarket in the area. Also, to add to your list of reasons to visit this wonderful store is the fact that their prices are great! Just $1.99/lb for the best brisket I have ever had the pleasure of smoking. Port butt is great and they make their own sausage and brats on site. GO HERE ASAP!!!!!

Just wanted to update- I had said it was slightly pricey. I must have been smoking crack that day because I went there again today after going to Fry's and Safeway. Not only is the meat here FAR better than a supermarket's meat, but the prices are actually BETTER as well. Also, they make their own sausage and brats here. GO HERE NOW!!!

Best beer in Arizona: Hop Knot IPA. Their Raj IPA is great too, but Hop Knot is their gem. Do not buy into the hype over Kiltlifter, it is not all that. Their food here is great, some of the best pub food I have had. Fish N Chips are especially bomb. Be sure to try theri sweet jalapeno sauce with your fries...

NPR Rocks. It is like breakfast for your brain. They play jazz at night, pretty pedestrian jazz selection though. Who cares about the jazz though, NPR is great and everyone should listen to it as part of their daily routine. It is better than the rap crap you are likely bumping next to me as I listen to NPR....

Wow. This place could be great if they did not charge 2-3 times what a head shop NOT on Mill Ave charges. I know their rent may be high, but their prices are like STUPID. A little tie-die baby onsie was $35! RIP OFF!!!! Smoking materials (pipes, bongs) are just STUPID. GO to Trails instead, for the love of God..... Biggest rip off head shop in Arizona.

Screw all of the "it is not real mexican food" people. This place is tasty. Great salsa! Anything on the menu that has Baja sauce on it is sure to be great. Chicken Poblano is great as well (there is even a little baja sauce in this dish). Don't listen to the haters, Macayo is the bomb!

Their spaghetti calzone is the best calzone I have ever had. Their signature spinach-tomato-garlic pizza is not my fav. pizza though. I like their spicy italian pizza with easy onions. Their sauce is very sweet, but it really is addicting! Get the thick crust, I think it is way better than their thin.

The food here is good, but in no way is it great. The steaks are okay, often they sear it a little too much and it ends up way too burnt on the outside. The actual facility is really cool, full of history. Prices are way too high for the quality of food they are selling.

Sides are weak. Very weak. Rib tips have no meat. Pulled pork can be good, but never great. Hot links, nasty. It seemed like they just do not even touch their links on the grill, it seemed just boiled. Nasty....

This place rules, my favorite fast mexican place. I get the veggie burro, it is bomb. Avacodo, beans, salsa and cheese. Salsa is good... Overall, great place to grab some good, quick grub.

The salsa was great, especially the green. The main course was just okay. Wife's soft tacos were a soggy, nasty mess. My burrito was not bad actually, the chicken was tasty. Rice and beans are BLAND; rice seemed too old, a little crunchy like it was left over from lunch. Overall, not a good place compared to other places in the same price range. I will go here again for the salsa and margaritas, but not the food.

Worst. Mexican. Place. Ever.   This was the most over-priced, crappy food I have ever eaten in the Phoenix area.   When you walk in it looks legit and even smells pretty good due to the wood they use to smoke some of their chicken. Once I opened the menu, I could not believe it. I think the cheapest dinner item was over $16. I tried the carnitas, a Mexican staple and something I usually enjoy. Not this time. In one word BLAND. No seasoning whatsoever. No salt. No pepper. No lime. Nothing at all to make this meat taste decent. It was tender, I will give them that, but it was more like jello than pork. The texture was pretty gross. We also had to pay extra to get tortillas with the carnitas. Who the hell does not serve tortillas WITH their carnitas? Seriously....  The black beans were okay, the only part of the meal I could actually stomach. The rice was crunchy and bland. The salsa was bland and watery. Also, no refills on the salsa... Cheap bastards charge me over $16 for BLAND CRAP and cannot even fill up my salsa for free?  The service was bad, slow and aloof.   I would rather eat at one of the "bertos" instead of this crap hole. Honestly, save yourself the money and find another Mexican joint. I am in shock that this place has customers.  Not even deserving of one star. That bad.

Nothing was good here. My wife got beef and broccoli, the beef was NASTY. I got a spicy chicken dish, again, nasty. The prices are high, the food stinks... Screw this place.

Presentation is great. However the ribs were gross, tough, and nasty. I did try my wife's monster pancake, not bad. However for the price I expect great ribs, not this crap.

I live on the line, go to ASU, and my work is on the line. It works well for me. My only beef is that people always sit where bikes are susposed to go, so it can be hard to commute with a bike.

I work at the nearby high school, and I am glad I was told about this place. Friendly service, and incredible food. These tamales are amazing. The negative reviews on here about this place puzzle me... Owner is nice as can be, the food is incredible.

The 5 star rating is in comparison to other fast food joints (i.e. Mickey D's, Burger King, J-Box ect. NOT sit-down joints... I would take a Four Peaks burger over I&O any day!)  I usually get grilled cheese with frilled onions, but I have had many a burger here. Fries are really good, but they do not age well, often becoming a little nasty on the ride home (202&Rural to Rural and Apache, not a long drive). Best staff in fast food, best food in fast food. Best burger in the world? Please, go to a real burger joint for that title, not fast food!

Great chain BBQ joint. I usually get ribs or rib tips. Every 4th or 5th time the rip tips can be a little tough, but nothing major. Prices are not too bad for a BBQ joint. Since great BBQ is hard to find, it is nice to have Dave's to fall back on.

I tried all of their meats, nothing too impressive. Their fish taco was pretty gross, and the pork was bland. I do, however, enjoy their veggie offerings. Always fresh and good. Green salsa is my fav.   I am also nervous of a place that is FILLED with flies, and this place is BUZZING with them.... Seriously gross.

The pizza: total bullocks. Tasteless, crust is gross, toppings are suspect.   Pasta: not great, tastes like it is all from a can. WAY too pricey; baked zitti will cost $7.50 for a pretty small amount. Give me a break.   Sandwiches: CRAP! I mean really bad.... Bread is nasty, and the meats are sub-par. Veggies are nasty as well...  Breakfast burritos: actually really good.

Burger- very good... everything one could want in a stacked burger.  Chicago dog- never had a real Chicago dog, so I do not know how authentic this is. I do know it is the bomb and I will have to compare when I am in Chicago later on this month.  Chili Dog- BOMB!!!! This was my favorite item I had. Cheesy, chili, onions...

This is the only place I will trust with my car. They never try to get you to spend extra money on things you do not need. I took my car in for power steering, they told me it was just dry, no leaks, filled the fluid, and sent me home. NO CHARGE.   I have also had major work done on my 2004 Honda Civic here, and it was by far the cheapest price I could fine. The work was done well, as it is almost a year later and the work they did has not proven faulty in the least.   I am bringing my car back tomorrow for a coolant leak. This is the only place where I know they will fix the problem without trying to make me pay for services and options that I do not need.   Honest, affordable auto mechanics....Wow that sounds strange if you say it out loud. However, once you visit Family Auto, you will see how honest and affordable they are.   Also, the owners are as nice as it gets. If you have to get your car fixed, skip all the other rip offs, and go to Family Auto.

Brisket was tender, juicy and good. Slaw was bomb, unique flavor to it. Beans were spicy as hell and very good. I was not going to try this place until I saw the Ozzy poster on the wall, then I knew I had to give it a try. I am glad I did, this is the best BBQ joint in the ASU area.

My order: brisket, smoked sausage, potatoes, jalapeno beans, jalapeno corn bread, berry pie.  Total for order: just over $13.   Portions:Small (especially for a bbq place)  Sauce: Bland, typical. What you would find in a bottle in a grocery store. Even the spicy was not good at all.   The food: The brisket was a complete disaster. I did the pull test to see if it was cooked properly. A properly cooked brisket will be slightly elastic, but will pull apart when pulled. This brisket pulled apart with no give whatsoever. Overcooked. The flavor of the brisket, well, was nowhere to be found. No smoke ring, no smoke flavor, no real seasoning to be tasted. I have had better brisket made in an oven. I wonder if this brisket really spent any significant time in a smoker...   The sausage was average, nothing special at all. Again, no smoke flavor to be found.  The sides: the potatoes were good. The beans were good. Neither was amazing, but I ate them happily. The jalapeno cornbread was nasty. It lacked any taste besides jalapeno. Very bland.   Desert: The pie was actually really good. I would come here to get a whole pie in the future. I am serious, the pie here was quite good.   Comments: The staff was really nice and seemed to stand behind their food. However, their positive and welcoming attitude did not make up for the fact that this BBQ is weak. I cannot give them another chance, because for the prices they charge I cannot risk another meal of this caliber. Besides the pie, very disappointed and I would never eat here again. Too bad, their staff was really nice...

Beer: The IPA was just okay, while the double IPA was definitely better. I have had a few more, like their rye, and their beer is not bad. However, I do notice that there is not much consistency from visit to visit, as far as what the IPA will taste like or what beers will be available. As far as being the most "intensely flavored" beers in the Valley, as claimed by another reviewer, I would have to disagree. This place is nowhere near that right now. That is not to say that they cannot grow into something special, but as of right now, they still need to work on consistency.   Food: Burgers. Burgers. More burgers. If you are not in the mood for a burger, you have a few appetizers to pick from. We opted for the fries (claimed to be in the Belgian style, fried in duck fat) and their artichoke dip... Both were not very good... The fries.... Look.... I have been to Belgium multiple times, specifically for beer and food. These fries are not Belgian in any way, shape or form. These fries were overcooked, and they season them with dried rosemary and thyme. Like, a LOT of rosemary and thyme. Who in their right mind would want to eat overcooked fries with dried twigs sprinkled liberally throughout? It was a greasy, overcooked, twiggy mess. Complete bullocks.   The artichoke dip, also bullocks. It came in a disposable cup, and based upon how it was cooked, and the temperature differences throughout the dish, I am pretty sure it was microwaved. It also had a very milky taste, and did not seem like a dip, but rather a collection of a few ill-thought ingredients that were not properly sealed together.    Overall, this menu is just bad, in my opinion. Perhaps I will return eventually and try a burger, but I will certainly not trust the appetizers ever again. The beer is not terrible, but certainly not anything special. If I do return, it will be in like a year, to see if they have made improvements.  I hate to give a local joint a bad review, but I just did not like it here that much.
