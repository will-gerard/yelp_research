First off, let me say this is probably going to be one of my longer reviews.  I own a 350z and wanted to get new rims and tires. Researched online for about a month and found the wheels/tire combo I wanted. I talked to one my friends who used to discount tire and was told to ask for the manager to get a discount and fair treatment. Mind you, this is a completely different discount tire who I won't put on here.  I called and talked to the manager. I wanted supersport tires from Michelin which are high performance tires that I can take to the track. These tires are special order only and are hard to find for the size I was looking for. He told me that he would call me back after he talked to Michelin to get the tire. I got a voicemail saying that he had news for me and to call back. I called him back the next day and unfortunately got another person who said he would help me since he is on the phone with another customer. Told me that those tires might take a while and was pushing different tires toward me. Explained I really wanted the supersports as I had done a lot of research on the tires and would have to think about the ones he was pushing me toward. I asked him as well how long it would take  for the supersports and he told me it would be backorder and I would need to wait anywhere from 3-6 months.  After I got off the phone, I was feeling really deflated and did some research on the tires he was pushing but didn't feel good about it. Thought about it bit more and decided to call another discount tire to get a second opinion. Luckily for me I got in contact with Juan. He said he would call around for me and see what he could find. That same day he called me back, I wasn't able to answer since I was at work but he told me that only 3 discount tires in the nation had them. But he said he would call me the next day and would let me know what he found. Next day he told me they were super had to get but he was able to find them. When I came in Juan was super helpful and even without a appointment got me out in under a hour. Not only that but he kept checking over everything to just ensure that everything is done properly. Ironically the other discount tire called me 2 days after I talked to Juan to tell me he got the tires miraculously somehow which was upsetting and confirmed my suspicion.   He was as stoaked as I was about the cars new look and told me I made a good choice which was cool. After I had left I realized I was missing my stock tire and that I needed to go back. On my way back, I managed to crash my Z into a curb and shatter the rim, and ruin the tire. I called Juan and he had it in the next day for me.  I am now back up and running and couldn't be happier with the tires and my car. I am so grateful to Juan for all that he did and a bit bummed that the other discount tire tried to play me, as I went through a friend's manager who he used to work there for.  Thanks again Juan! You rock!

Well I wish I could say something positive but I  honestly have never have waited this long at any little ceasers. I'm actually writing this review while I'm still sitting in the lobby.  I got here at 930pm, and it's now 10:04. When I ordered the guy behind the counter wasn't happy that I was here, but there was 5 other people waiting for pizza.   I talked to some of them about their orders and everyone except for one person had only ordered 2 hot and readys. The other person only one.  Not only that but I would not recommend coming to this place late at night. Tons of sketchy people, bums, and people asking for money. I never thought I would be complaining about speed from lil ceasers.  And now they are complaining about the amount of people/orders they have to deal with it. I get it, it sucks that we ordered before you closed, but I was even here 30 minutes prior and I'm still waiting.  If you want pizza, order delivery. You will get it faster, not wait in a lobby for 30 minutes, and save on gas!

Whatever you do, DO NOT GO TO THIS HERTZ. I can not strain this enough.  In short, this Hertz was the closest to my shop, so I ended up going through them with my insurance company since my car was in the shop. The driver who picked me up was nice, and ended up being the main person who was doing the paperwork. However he was new, which is totally cool, but didn't know a lot of answers to my questions.  Then the unthinkable happens. I am talking to this agent on getting the rental, I was curious about price so I asked him however he didn't know. So he got his manager, and his manager proceeds to tell me that I need to pay something like $430 for the car for the week, even though my insurance covers 80% percent of cost, not to mention how high that cost would be if they were covering 80%. So I explained to the manager that there is absolutely no way that can be right as even on their website without any insurance help the car would've been around $100 to rent. The manager tells the agent that I'm working with to just get to the last page and then we will have an accurate price. Turns out my rental was only $20 for the entire week! Crazy how huge of a difference that is, and how I would've been charged an enormous price. I even confronted the manager about this practice but he just blew me off and didn't even offer an apology.  As if that wasn't bad, the car that they tried to put me in was a dark brown car, with rust damage, curb rash, multiple dents, and even the fender was falling off the car! When I asked my agent about this he just brushed it off and said that he would mark it in the damage book, but that it's fine. However insurance or not I don't want to be driving a literal piece of poo around.  I got in the car, looked on yelp and found the closest one with higher ratings, and they were able to switch me out into a upgraded one for no extra cost to me.  There are TONS of Hertz in the valley, DO NOT go to this one as they will attempt to rip you off, or just have no clue on what they are even talking about. Either way you will be in a worse situation.

Before I used Yelp, I used Google reviews and ratings to find places that were good to go to. I was looking for a mechanic and found another company (that I won't name) who did work on my car for me, but they didn't do things they charged me for and it was completely a mess. I finally found Faith Works Automotive and I knew that they would be my saving grace.  I booked a appointment over the phone and I believe it was Jason I spoke with. Super nice and helpful. When I arrived the lot was a bit full which was nice. I walked in and there were a couple employee's sitting there, they gave me a weird look and left the office back to the garage. I thought it was a bit weird but I didn't think there was any malice behind it. They were very polite, listened to the things I need such as a oil change and a couple other maintenance things like the water pump and timing belt.  Promptly called me back and quoted me the price. It was VERY reasonable and they had it done for me same day.  If you are looking for a quality mechanic go here. I would still go here if I didn't have a new modified car that needs specific attention.

I have ordered from Hungry Howie's Pizza on more times than I can count, since I was in high school if you can believe that! I love the garlic bread pizza crust and so do all of my friends.  Not only do they have great pizza but it is silly cheap. I mean, $5 for a large pizza and good quality? Sounds like Little Ceasers but this pizza is actually pretty bomb! Not only that but their delivery service is always fast, even at high times like 2am or so.  If you haven't tried hungry howies pizza yet, now is the time!

First, I want to say that not only was this company preferred from my insurance which for me I assume isn't a 5 star company but I was extremely apprehensive because a couple of my friends have had the glass installers try to force deductibles that aren't needed, and also are hard to work with. My experience was happily the complete opposite of that.  I talked to my insurance company and they got a appointment setup with clear cut auto glass over the phone. They were very professional and helped me schedule a date three days later. During that time my car would be at a different address than I gave them when we talked. I called them and they were very helpful in making sure that was switched. Maybe a easy thing for them but it put me at ease.  When it came time for the install, the installer Nigel gave me a call and told me his 15 minutes out, he was still on time but it was nice to know he was on his way. Not only that but he was very professional as well, and told me just to hang out inside and he would let me know when he was done. I know that sounds weird to say, but I have had mobile services done before and there is this awkward "should I stand here or go inside" moment to a couple of minutes. He helped that not happen.  Once he was done, which was only about 40 minutes, he showed me the work, and also explained how long I needed to wait for it to dry. There wasnt any weird asking for money or deductibles. He had a clipboard with my insurance claim on it for me to sign and that was it. Not only that but I have a 350z and he commented on some modifications and changes that he has seen and I was doing. It's another small thing but him talking to me about that showed he knew more about my car than just the windshield replacement which was awesome too!

First off, let me just say Scott is a awesome guy and his service just as great!   I contacted Scott last week to get my 2004 lancer cleaned so I could sell it. My line of work doesn't allow me to talk on the phone but Scott was very easy to talk via text and email. I decided to go with his Star 1 package, and he was able to set a time with me for the next week when I was free.  Scott showed up about 10 minutes early which was awesome! He also has his own water and everything on his truck. It doesn't really matter that much either way, but it was cool that he didn't need to hook up to my water at the house. He showed me things he couldn't clean of buff which I already knew but it was nice that he was making sure I understand that as well. He also asked if there was anything specific I needed cleaned, and then went to work on my VERY dirty car that had been sitting under a tree in my driveway for 2 weeks. Told me to hang out inside and he would knock once he was done and quoted me about 2 hours. I know it sounds weird to talk about how he told me I can hang out inside but with mobile services sometimes there is this weird "should I go inside or just hang out outside..?" He was able to make sure that didn't happen.  Scott knocked on my door when he was done like he said, and showed me the car. The really cool thing about this is that he had all the doors and the hood open so I could look around to make sure everything looked good. It absolutely was sparkling and looked like a brand new car off the lot. Not only that but while I was looking at it he just asked me why I was getting it cleaned and about the things that I did to my car. That was pretty awesome as well because it showed that he genuinely cared about my car and what I was doing with it.  Thank you Scott and everyone on Yelp for reviewing him. I will be using him to wash my new 350z here shortly, and will be recommending it to anyone else that needs a professional, friendly, and most importantly fantastic looking car detailing service!

I am so thankful for everyone's reviews. I called about three days ago because I had a couple small but easily noticeable chips. I talked to my insurance and was apprehensive about using my glass coverage. I also talked to a couple of friends who worked for insurance agencies and they didn't think I would be able to get the whole thing replaced. That's when I decided to start looking for out of pocket repairs. Since I like using yelp to tell me about good businesses out there.   I quickly found blue chip auto glass and was happy to see so many reviews that were 5 stars. I didn't hesitate to call. The person who I talked to on the phone was very polite and helped squeeze me in 2 days and helped make sure it worked with my weird work schedule.   The customer service didn't stop there either. They came to my house right on time. We looked at the damages with him and he saw not only those issues but that one of those chips had already been repaired. Not only that but there were tons of other little dents. I noticed it but didn't know how serious it was. He was still happy to fix what he could but he help persuade me to feel confident on calling my insurance company. He told me the repairs would take about 30 minutes but somehow they did it even quicker in 15 minutes.   Not only was the job ridiculously inexpensive, they even took some money off of that because of a promotion they were offering.   The good news is that it's not only fixed, I have a appointment to get my windshield replaced this coming week. Unfortunately it won't be with blue chip repair because of my insurance company but I am very grateful that blue chip auto not only fixed my window, they also helped put confidence in  me into getting the necessary things done.

Well I can't say I am surprised at my experience after reading other reviews.  I ordered a new battery for my car yesterday that they wouldnt allow shipping pn and sears emailed me telling me I could pick it up today. I happened to be on yelp this morning before I went to pick up the battery and that already made me not excited about picking it up based on bad reviews.  So I drive over and walk in. No one really in the shop and a couple of employees talking to each other, no big deal. I walk up to the counter and one of them asks me how he can help. I explained that I just needed to pick up a battery I ordered online. He asked me if i wanted it installed, which by the way is very easy to do and after reading the reviews I never want them to touch my car. Ever. I tell him no and he lets it go fairly quickly.   He then proceeds to tell me the total is $15. I told him I already paid online and didn't understand why I needed to pay again. He explains that it's for the battery core recycling. Confused, I asked why I would be charged that when I am not even having Sears install the battery? Why would I need to pay a fee for Sears to recycle a battery core Sears dont even have?  Instantly he says, "you can talk to a manager about the fee if you need." Instead of arguing I went ahead and just paid for this ridiculous fee for something they aren't even doing for me and left.  Based on my experience I will not be returning, ever. Not only that, but if they are going to charge me a fee for something they didn't even do, I can't imagine what they charge and dont do if you bring your car to get worked on.

Went in for the free air check for my 2014 mitsubishi evolution today. I used to live in tempe and go to one there that did my tire checks for my discount tire tires since I was 16.   When I got to this location there was 1 car in the bay and no line in the waiting area. I parked and got out. Made eye contact with 3 people and waited for a minute or so before someone even acknowledged me. Finally someone came up and said that they would be with me in a bit.  Finally a couple minutes later someone came up, offered me a water and started doing the air check. That part took all of 2 minutes. Then he started talking about how I only had 32% tread  left on my tires and that if I had time for a full inspection. I thought it was pretty unfortunate that he said that, as the tires only had 8,000 miles on them. I also thought that if I wasn't more informed I probably would have been shocked, let them check, and then convince me to replace all my tires.  I appreciate the free air check, that I honestly could've done myself in roughly the same amount of time. However I thought this would be fast and hassle free, which it wasn't.  I've used discount tire my whole driving life, and will continue using them. However would not recommend this one specifically because of the long wait and dishonesty.

I honestly love this muffler shop. I have been to three others and Scottsdale muffler has been on the ball with everything I needed. Not only did they do a stand up job of replacing my piping to 2.25 inches and adding a muffler. I wasn't quite happy with the volume so I bought a new muffler and asked them to replace it. They were more happy to do it and they also continued to update me on the progress. Amazing prices with amazing service. Scottsdale muffler is my muffler shop!

Before I got into detail about Eclipse's wonderful job on my 350z, I first want to talk about my previous experience not even 2 weeks ago.  I first started this long journey online looking at different tint brands and the best quality I could find. Looking online everyone was saying that the 3M product gave the darkest black that you could get. Because my car is white I decided that I would want a tint film like that. I used to work at a tint shop myself quite a while ago as a car runner and I know how important the tint was, but also the installer. So I started looking.  Looking around on Yelp, since it has been a great place to find good shops, I found a dealer that does 3M tinting. I will not name the company since the issue was resolved, but I found them on Yelp and ask them about tinting my car. I was pretty clear about the limo tint around the car, as my lancer has that exact limo tint on it as well. After the install, I confirmed with the lady at the desk that it was infact limo even though it seemed a bit light. After not being able to get over the fact that it didn't seem dark enough, I looked at the receipt and sure enough it said that the front windows were 35% and the back was the limo at 5%. It was very disheartening that 5 star tint shop on Yelp let me down in this way, so I cautiously looked for someone else to tint my car, again.  Luckily, this is where I found Eclipse and a couple other high ranking tint shops. All the reviews were fantastic and after sending a message to a couple companies, I really liked the clarity that Eclipse replied with. I did think it was a bit strange that they didn't have a way for me to message them on Yelp but that was okay. So I went to their site to read more about them and I saw there was a option to talk to someone via chat from the site. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal, but I wanted to go over the details that I got via email on what I wanted to do. I talked to Lee Anne Migray who manages the office and she was absolutely outstanding to talk to. She answered all my questions that I had and was able to make an appointment. Not only that but I had a couple set backs that forced me to need to reschedule, I called in and she remembered talking to me and what my car was which is crazy! She happily changed my installation date and also confirmed the day before to make sure I remembered.  The install was completely fantastic. After talking to Eclipse I decided to do 5% all the way around like I wanted in the first place with the previous company, and I also decided to get the whole windshield tinted 80% to help with UV rays, as well as a windshield strip at the top mostly for looks. Eric was right in the window that I was told he would be in. Not only that but Eric clarified what tint percentage and what was being done to the car to make sure there were no mistakes. He took my keys and was ready to go. I asked him how long it would take and he told me about two hours and he was right on.  The car is a night and day difference with the tint. Me and Eric both talked about how different the car looked and also talked about my previous experience. Believe it or not Eric used to work in the same tint shop as my previous companies owner, but how different both of them are. Not only that but Eric was even able to take cards! I felt bad that I didn't have cash on me but Eric assured me it wasn't a issue.  A huge thank you to the Eclipse Window Tinting team, you really came through where the other company couldn't. Also being mobile saved me a huge hassle!

I went to this car wash based on the cheaper hand wash options. Plus I didn't have time for a full detail. To be honest, it was nice to go with a fast hand wash drive through. I went here twice, first time for interior/exterior and the second time for just the exterior. Both times there were spots left over and the inside wasnt as clean as I would've liked. But you get what you pay for.  If you want a quick hand wash option inside of going to a drive through car wash, this is the place.

This review is a bit overdue but I realized I should leave a review on how frustrating verizon makes every process.   I made the huge mistake of taking my phone to the river. I had a Galaxy S3 with a Bluetooth speaker I bought online, and which was waterproof unlike my phone. I put my phone in a couple Ziploc bags, which ended up being fruitless as the bags got water in them and my phone died. I put it in a bag of rice overnight but that didn't fix it.   I pay for the damage protection plan so I called this store since they are closest and told them my situation. They instructed me to come in so they could take a look.  I arrived and per usual they were moderately busy. I put in my spot in line and waited about 15 minutes which wasn't a huge deal. After waiting one of the "specialist" came over and asked me for my name. Once he confirmed that I was who was waiting, he gave me a card and told me to call or go online with that. I asked him if I could do this in the store. He said no. I then asked why I was told to come in, he didn't know either.   Waste of my time and the situation didn't feel like they didn't even care because I wasnt buying anything from them.  I wish there was a 5 star verizon store.

Super friendly staff and I loved the laid back atmosphere.   Right when I walked in it was packed but I was offered a drink and it ended up only being a 5 minute wait.  I got the bacon burger which was pretty satisfying and not overcooked. My girlfriend got the PB&J burger with bacon. She said it was definitely different but she did enjoy the burger. Just be careful because it is VERY messy. Also I got the normal side of fries which were excellent.   Andrea was our waitress and she was SUPER friendly and helpful as this has been our first time there. I am a big burger guy and I wasn't disappointed.   Also reminded me of being at San Diego which I had just came from which was awesome. Beachish atmosphere with super relaxed music. Honestly no complaints here!

This was my first time here. We were told it would be a 15 to 30 minute wait inside or outside. We opted to sit inside, then they came over and told us that the outside was open if we wanted to go. We decided after waiting to go, however when we got outside there was literally no one there! I got the pepperoni pizza with sausage. My tabel also ordered a Oktoberfest pitcher of beer and two cocktails. The waitress was very nice and polite. However our waitress stopped coming out when it came time to pay and we waited 30 minutes until we grabbed someone to get our tab. After that it was another 15 minutes before we had our card ran.  All in all, a cool place but very disappointed to pay that much and get bad service.
