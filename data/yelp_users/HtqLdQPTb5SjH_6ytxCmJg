Friendly professional staff PA was great talked to us not down to us. Made my daughter feel at ease and comfortable. The Dr. Came in gave her opinion told us what to expect IF it had to be removed felt confident there wasn't cause for alarm. Biopsy was done to make sure all was ok.

Many many years ago I use to take the family to the Tucson location and always enjoyed the atmosphere, food, Sangria Swirls and salsa. That location closed back about 6 yrs ago or so. This location was nothing to write home about the Salsa tasted flat with no zip and the swirl was weak. I'll pass next time

service was very slow and it wasn't that busy. I had an omelette it was ok but the single piece of toast was dry and over toasted, my friend had pancakes and loved them. Groupon made it better

Met some friends for happy hour and WOW did we get happy!!!!!! Small bar area with lots of regulars. The margs are pre made unless you do a call tequila and they have some very good ones. The bartender knows how to mix a happy hour drink!!!!! She was funny and entertained us. Salsa is very good chips are fresh and mini chimi's are a great appetizer.

My daughter came in from Tucson and was wanting breakfast so I asked have you been to this place before she said no and that we should try it out..... I'd read good reviews.  If you've never been there before Plan on taking a few extra minutes to find the place it's tucked back in the mall & not easy to find.  It was midweek and not overly busy. The waitress started out friendly, nice and very talkative I ordered  a cappuccino and my daughter ordered juice. we only took a few minutes to look at the menu I noticed it was really very limited, If you're a corn beef hash person it's definitely up your alley but unfortunately that's not my favorite. We both decided on the traditional eggs, home style potatoes and bacon. My daughter added the fresh fruit bowl. When our order came to the table everything was as ordered the presentation good & cooked correctly, her fruit was fresh and tasty. Everything from there on went bad. The waitress was nonexistent came back only once with the forgotten ketchup my daughter had requested, never refilled our waters never asked if everything was ok, never asked if we needed anything  else we had to ask another server for our check. Our server brought the check with the big smile and a friendly attitude..... thank you so much for coming in sucking up for the tip. AND only cleared my plate we were clearly both done. After another 10 minutes of waiting we asked another server once again if they could take our check and credit card so we could leave. I understand poor service or delayed service when you're busy but this was midweek mind you and not very busy......very disappointing.

Went for lunch as I was craving a hardy gyro. I hadn't  been here for quite some time and I'm pretty sure the gyro wasn't any thing like they serve now. 3 slices of dry precooked packaged meat slapped on a grill  rolled in a dry pita, sauce, lettuce and onion   With a side salad. Not even a light lunch. I won't be back.

Great little sports bar just a couple blocks away. Large patio, lots of TV's. The pool and shuffleboard tables are a bit of a squeeze. The happy hour and reverse happy hour are very good and for can be a hit or miss. Usually the waitress will tell you if you as if something is good or not.... with an honest answer. This is a growing local chain and I've been to 3 of the locations which seem to be consistant.

Not all charity organizations are created equal. SA still has their purpose mind and really support the local location and community with your donations. The store is clean uncluttered and doesn't feel like you should be fumigated when you leave.

I lived about 3 blocks from the location on Central ave so when I was in Glendale for a festival and saw this little dive burger shop I said HELL YA!!!! My daughter and her BF were a bit skeptical but left full and smiling. My daughter was amazed at the flavor of the burger...... old fashion style. Don't pass this place up or the Central ave location either.

I have walked past on many a busy and packed house. This day was quiet and nice we were able to sit on the upper deck. Simple tavern no frills go to the bar to order and the drinks are good..... no skimping on the liquor here. Missed the entertainment because we were hungry and they don't serve food. So if you just wanna get your drink started this is a good first stop

Service can be slow and the food comes out slow. The Shrimp tacos on tuesday are worth the wait. Amazing! The fish tacos are good but don't compare to the shrimp.

This was my first visit and my very first venture into the culinary world of chicken and waffles. I do have to say I still haven't wrapped my palette or maybe my mind around the concept. One is a breakfast item primarily and the other a dinner main attraction. This lead me to start thinking..... Which came first the chicken or the egg? Well I'm thinkin the egg because the egg and waffle as a morning meal complement each other so much better then the chicken and waffle for dinner. The whole meal l kept thinking damn that Mac n cheese and cornbread at the next table look delish!! Ok so.... The review.... My friends started with fried okra it looked good but I'm not a fan in general. They neither complained or raved..... Shoulda asked.  The chicken was fried to a golden brown, moist, tender and very flavorful. I had the breast and could have eaten another. It wasn't large just average in size. ;-) The waffle was big but flat no rise to it (I am partial to the Belgian variety) flavor was good but just a waffle. I did try the various eating techniques, hot sauce on chicken with the waffle and syrup in one bit, then without the hot sauce next was one bite then the other, tried reverse order but nothing wowed me as a combo.... Still my eyes, mouth and stomach wandered to the table next to me... Cornbread Mac n cheese oh how I desire you.   The service very good friendly and attentive. The cakes looked amazing. But already had the sweet craving satisfied with the waffle. If you are a kool aid fan this is your place. However I saw no stained upper lips..... Very unusual  :-/ I will be back for the more traditional southern fried chicken dinner. Mmm, Mmm, Mmm!!!

For Christmas I was wanting to give Oil and Vinegar sets for gifts so I searched several stores before finding these guys in Old Town Scottsdale. They have an excellent selection that is fresh and flavorful with samples and knowledgable staff. They are not the easiest to find but well worth it when you do.

Late lunch...... Large variety on the  menu. I had the filling station special (grilled ham and cheese) plenty of thin sliced ham with a very good Dijon mustard sauce. My friend had the fountain hill club wrap which was enough for two people very good! Service was prompt and courteous

The Pollo Fresco was awesome!  The white sauce over the chicken breast complemented the rice with fajita veggies very well... the veggies had pineapple in it for a nice twist to the normal grilled variety.  The chips came with a hot fire roasted salsa and a medium salsa both with great flavor. The Margs were weak but he server assured me it was because they were training a new bartender and to come back on a happy hour or weekend and I would luv it. Goupon is a good deal.

This was my first visit and it was very pleasant. We sat on the patio which is pretty good sized with the option to sit near the street, mall courtyard or at the bar. Good selection of beers and burger options. Three of the four of us opted for burgers which were cooked nicely to order, very moist and flavorful. There was alway someone coming by asking if we needed anything and how we were doing. Didn't have to wait and look for our waitress as it was a tag team service....... nice

The place was busy but not beyond control decent one room bar. We sat at a table near the door and had no acknoledgement for 10 minutes so we decided to go sit at the bar. Bartender was friendly and attentive. The grill was right there next to the bar and you could watch everything. The main cook did nothing to help a persons appetite unless you were looking for a reason NOT to eat. Scary! They were only serving cornbeef & cabbage for St. Paddy's so we didn't eat. The really good thing about the place is they serve Corona light on tap AND they also serve Mikes hard lemonade on tap..... Large glasses for less then $5.00 each. Really cool!!!!

This is a new car wash the old one was pretty much torn out and replaced. This new wash is terrible. Got the $10 wash bugs still on the front, the dryers left tons of water and soap. Top it off there's no air for blowing water outta the cracks and if you use the free vac to do it the tell you to stop.   I won't be back.
