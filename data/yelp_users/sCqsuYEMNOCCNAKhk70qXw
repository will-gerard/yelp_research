Terrible. Go to King Wongs up the street much better service and food. Not as nice on the inside but food is edible. Told the long haired bartender I wasn't happy with the food and he said 'sorry to Hear that' and didn't even try to remedy the situation. Autumn Court, #notevenonce

The bright faces match the vibrant juice. The new cocktail menu got me extra awesome on Saturday.
