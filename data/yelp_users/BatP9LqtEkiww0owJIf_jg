Samurai Comics is the best comic book shop in town for new books. They have reasonable prices and don't mark up some of the variants at all or as much as other spots. They also have a lot of gaming events going on so check out their calendar.

I've been getting delicious sandwiches from Stumpy's for about 15 years now. I really love the Italian Classic and the French Dip. Stumpy's represents the regions well! Its so good that my wife makes me stop and pick up something whenever I'm in the neighborhood.

Me and my wife come to this place all the time. She needs a lot of coffee, that's why. Anyways, we like to come here and get an black tea for me and an Americano for my wife and then head on over to Petsmart to look at puppies and kitties. Next we go over to Ross and try to score some sweet deals so we look like high fashion. That's basically how every weekend goes and it's all started by this very awesome Starbucks. A+

This is a great sports bar. Me and my wife have started coming to this place all the time with some friend and let me tell you why.   1. Good beer selection. You wouldn't expect a cheese head bar (Green Bay Packers) to have as many craft beers on tap. No offense to the North Midwest, or whatever it's called, but those guys are known for producing cheap American pilsners.  2. Good bar food. I would stay away from Mexican food here, but things like cheese steak, fried cheese curds, wings, and burgers are delicious.  3. Good prices. The foods and beers prices are very reasonable.  4. Lots of TVs.

Good luck if you end up with something defective. I purchased an Apple Time Capsule that would lose network connectivity after a couple hours. It took some time to figure out what was going on, so by time I narrowed it down to the router I was past their 15 day limit of caring.  I was told there was nothing they can do even though I hadn't even made the first payment on it. They didn't even suggest any options for what to do with a broken 29 day old, $300 router...just sorry, we can't do anything.   Good luck.

I really want to try this place based on all the reviews and pictures.   Unfortunately there is a sign on the window that says they are closed due to family emergency and will reopen January 25th.   Still not open and it's March.  I wish the best for their family and hope they get back to making delicious food soon. I'll update this review once they open back up. This is informational only.

You should do what I do and steal your wife's coupons around holidays. Girls love junk from this place and it always feels good to save a little coin if you know what I mean.   Also, if your wife is anything like my wife and has to get her face did here, go to the 99 Cent Only Store while you wait. They have a lot of cool stuff there and it makes you feel like a rich man to afford anything in the store.

My wife and I come here all the time to pick up some quick groceries or adult beverages. It's a pretty good Safeway. The people working there are nice and most of them have been there awhile so we see a lot of the same faces.   While you're here you should pick up some pugliese bread. It's very delicious Italian bread and the best from Safeway. Oh what's that? You don't know what pugliese bread is? That's alright, there's about a 80% chance the people in this bakery don't know what it is either, but keep trying and eventually you'll get it.   Also download the Safeway app to your phone. It will save you a lot of money. It's kind of a pain, but I find that it's worth it in the long run.

My wife and I come to this place all the time. The people running the place are legit and this is the kind of old fashiony Chinese food restaurant you wanna go to where it's a hole in the wall, mom and pop shop, but has that fabulous 1970's decor. We came here on Valentines for some love supper and were shocked by their wine prices. I think they were all $13.95 a bottle which is very reasonable for house wine prices. Happy family and fried dumplings are main stays for us. Everything is great so try it all. You'll have left overs for tomorrow too.

This place is real good for feeding your wife before a movie. It's way cheaper than most of the other restaurants around the area and it's pretty healthy so your wife won't get a pot belly. Win win in my book.   Also you can probably sneak a pita into the movies if you're short on time. This is a lot better than eating a whole bunch of popcorn.

When I was a kid the Western Bacon was one of my favorite burgers. Forget about Whoppers and Big Macs because I was all down for putting a fried onion ring and BBQ sauce on my burgers.  Fast forward to today; I honestly don't think this is the best fast food sandwich anymore. I think everything has changed about it. Well basically it seems like Carl's Jr has changed all of their vendors and quality of products. Ingredients are still the same, it just tastes different. Carl's Jr. buns are now kind of waxy, their burgers don't taste that good, and the bacon is just chewy fat strips. I just hate these sandwiches now. I won't be eating one again or at least not for awhile.    p.s. I had to order their onion rings because they changed up their fries. I'm sorry but I loved their French fries, but their new ones are the worst. These onion rings suck too!

Sometimes life is a compromise. Like when my lunch buddies at work want to drag me to Applebee's or Chili's or some junk like that for lunch, I'll compromise with Red Robin. We're still talking junky food from all the same venders but at least they have bottomless steak fries and other perks.    The biggest advantage of eating here is that I can get a Royal Red Robin Burger. Basically this means a regular hamburger with an egg laid on top of it. How awesome is that? If you know anything about me, you know that I love fried eggs on top of anything; pancakes, beef, asian rice bowls, anything!  Okay so yeah, the egg, it's awesome. Let's talk about what's not awesome. Lettuce. Order this thing without lettuce and you will thank me in the morning. I mean something so beautiful is an egg on a hamburger doesn't need to be ruined by warm vegetation! The description says crisp lettuce? That is lies and we both know it. Just say no to lettuce.    Some other ideas for this sandwich are: Sprinkle some of that Red Robin seasoning on it. It's pretty good. Order it with a chocolate milkshake. That can't be bad.  Oh and Red Robin's has a pretty sweet deal where their French fries are all you can eat, or as I like to call it, the kids eat for free special. So if you have like 20 effin' kids, please take them here and feed them all these French fries, meanwhile you get to mow down on this tasty sammich. I have the best ideas!

I'm giving this Arby's 4 stars based on comparisons to other Arby's or fastfood joints, not other restaurants.   Anyways, basically here's what went down when I was here, Arby's  had some deal for a French dip value meal for $5 but I also wanted some beef & cheddar sandwiches and they were 2 for $5 as well. Basically I was a fat ass this day and ordered both deals, which I justified my gluttony by telling myself that I always spend $10 or more on lunch.   This was an great lunch! I didn't eat it all but I got to eat all the stuff I wanted to. I have a strange Arby's guilty pleasure.

Stinkweeds is the best record store in town for indie/alternative music releases. They have a great vinyl selection, both new and used. Their staff is friendly and knowledgeable, really top notch! If you need concert tickets, they are the best way to go. The convenience charge is only a buck, which is much cheaper than online, just bring cash for the tickets. (They take most major credit cards for other purchases.) They take pride in their local first attitude. Enjoy.

This probably isn't the best Fry's in our area, that title goes to the Tatum & Shea location, but they get 5 stars for having the best gas prices in my area and carrying diesel. Their prices are usually even lower than the large box membership stores!  The store inside has recently been removed so it's nice and you can definitely get your normal grocery items.

This is me and my wife's go to spot for when we can't think of what we want to eat...or are craving it so hard, both of these things happen often.   First off their tortillas are the best in Phoenix. This is the only place I make sure to also pick up a buttered tortilla or cheese quesadilla just to make sure I'm getting extra tortilla action in my meal.  My favorite thing to get is the chimichanga combo, but I also love the beef tacos, enchiladas, and 3 way burritos. Oh also they recently started serving carne asada burritos and those are real delicious too! Actually I like everything they have, let's be real.

I've seen Lunch Room pop up in my Yelp search results for a few years now but never tried it. Sandwiches are pretty much my favorite foods, so I'm always like, "Yelp, where's the good sandwiches at." These guys would pop up with no/very few reviews so I never made it around to visit...until today!  Today I was in one of those, "I'm not sure if it's breakfast time or lunch time," moods, so I got an egg salad sandwich lunch combo on marble rye. Their egg salad is made with regular mayo (not Miracle Whip, I checked), the marble rye is thick sliced and fluffy, soft and delicious, and then it also comes with lettuce, tomato, and mayo if you want. It's a yummy, traditional egg salad!  The prices are very fair at around $6 for a sandwich and $7 for a combo. The next time I go, I'm going to try a macaroni or potato salad side instead of chips and a pickle (not that they were bad, just normal store bought stuff). The places is really set up for delivery or carry out as their slogan is "You Ring...We Bring!" but they do have 3 or 4 small tables set up so I don't think they'll get too mad at you if you want to eat there.   These guys do cater so you can have sandwiches delivered to your lunch meeting and get your business on without leaving the office.

This is the movie theater my wife and I usually come to watch movies. We like it because it's close and like Harkin's loyalty cups. I've been telling my wife for years that I'm going to make her start wearing a free popcorn shirt  Overall this theater has all the stuff you want. 16 movies going on, all sorts of the usual expensive treats you need, a good sized parking lot, and it's not usually super crowded.   We are really lucky to have this Harkins in our neighborhood!

In the Scottsdale Airpark is a little gyros place. It's probably the best place up there for just standard gyros and a good way to get a little change from the regular old traditional restaurants. So that's why today I decided to hit Greek Gyros up.    I ordered the Gyro Value Meal. It comes with a gyro sandwich, french fries, and a fountain soda. The gyro is quite tasty. It's freshly cut off of one of those rotating gyro meat cookers, which is key for gyro sandwiches. The tzatziki sauce has little bits of cucumber in it which makes it really good. I like to order an extra side of sauce for mine.  Their french fries are pretty good. They are much like french fries you find in a lot of these gyro places, kind of like smaller steak fries.   All in all, Greek Gyros is a yummy place and a great value.

I like to come to this NYPD for some lunch. My thing to get is a slice of Wallstreet and a small Greek salad. It's like $6 and change for the combo. I recommend dipping your crust in the Greek dressing. Probably better for you than ranch. Oh but if they don't have any Wallstreet prepared, don't make the mistake of ordering it anyways. What they do is grab a slice of pepperoni and then stick all the missing toppings on that thing. I think this is a typical thing to do, but there are so many meats on a Wallstreet that it doesn't end up tasting right since the toppings aren't baked in the right way.

This place really needs to work on their service. Hiring cashiers is one thing, training them to give good service makes a business so much better. I'm pretty sure this place's management doesn't really care about customers, more focused on loss prevention and keeping the store running.

I've been coming to Habanero's since they opened. They are the best and most authentic Mexican spot in the Scottsdale Airpark. The food is always delicious, they have great service, and great prices. They have two locations in Scottsdale now. The other one is on Scottsdale and Shea.

So one day my wife and I went on over to our local breakfast shop Scramble. The place is a great addition to our area and their menu is both breakfasty and Arizonaee, which we like.   When I got in there my Italian stallion kicked into gear and I ordered the brizza with ham and cheese. Heck yeah! Sounds so good. A pizza, a breakfast, hams, eggs, and cheese pizza I can has. I got this thing and was like, "Ah, no's. Don't like." Basically it comes down to this. The pizza crust was too bready. It dried my mouth out and I couldn't taste nothing for days mang. I mean it is filling and somewhat tasty but I think it's really not the best idea ever.   Honestly this place is awesome though, I'm just not recommending the Brizza. We eat there all the time.

I love the 99 Cents Only Store. I can afford a lot of stuff here.  The best time here was when this little boy walks up to me with a citrus toilet bowl cake (like those urinal cake things that hangs on the side of toilet bowls) and asked me what it was. I told him it was for cleaning and he says, "no, candy!" And starts licking the wrapper. I can't make this stuff up.

This place is one of my new favorites for lunch here in the airpark...and I've tried just about everything. This is a small family run Asian fusion type joint. It's the kind of place where you shouldn't be surprised if you see their young daughters hanging out and chatting up the customers (they're super cute the one time I saw them).   I'm giving them 5 stars because they can whip you up a quality lunch for under $5. There's a whole list of options over rice for $4.95 posted outside. On the inside they have even more lunch specials ranging from $5.50-$6.95 and these things come with fried rice and choice of spring rolls or crab puffs. It's really a heck of a deal for an quick and satisfying lunch.

Wooooweeee!!! Dang this place is good!   My wife and I came here before seeing a show at the Rhythm Room and we brought our hunger.   First off it should be known that this place is BYOB so that means you can bring your own beer or wine and maybe other booze stuffs but not sure. We didn't bring our own boozes so we had Coke and Jasmine tea. I had the Coke, bad idea. It's just regular old real sugar Coke, so you know what that's like. It's great if you're at a food truck, but this place has awesome teas and other asian style drinks that are sure to be much better than dang ol' Mexican Coke. I tried my wife's jasmine tea and it was seriously some of the best tea stuffs ever and I drink a lot of tea.   For food we split the Mi Keaw Noodle Soup, which is the pork dumplings and shrimp one. It was so dang good. You get some plum sauce and chili sauce to season it to taste. They also provide some veggies, etc to add to it. Think pho style stuff.  For our entree we split the Lakhana's Lok Lak Beef I think. It was these delish beef medallions served with a tangy/spicy/gingery sauce and fresh raw veggies. It was super good. My only disappointment is that I wanted to try everything else.   Anyways, you can bet we'll be back anytime we're in the area for a show.

Let me give you some tips about this place.   First off don't tell my wife I come here, she might get mad. But if you did, I would just tell her that I only come for the food. That's what you should tell your wife whenever she gets mad at you for coming here too because it's true. They actually have good food. Also you can tell your wife that you just watched sports and fail blogs on TV and didn't see none of those ladies. Because that's true too, they have a lot of TVs playing sports and fail blog videos. Also if you buy a calendar or mousepad or something, keep that at work...I don't know how to explain that one man.

Today was my first visit here. This place is pretty awesome. Really good food except I'm not into the french fries they have. They are really small and skinny and crispy. Some people probably like this kind of french fries, but not me.   Anyways, I wish it wasn't raining today because I would have been really into getting my car washed while I munched on a burger.  So yeah, I'm really full right now, time for a nap.

Winco is an awesome grocery store. Prices are rad and stuffs is abundant! Me and my wife like to come here for stuff like produce, cat litter, cheese, loose spices, and the best croissants.  A couple things to know. They only accept checks and debit cards, so regarding your Amex card, you can leave home without it.  Also lines can be long...plenty of time to write a review like this!

I'm lucky enough that Emerson comes to my office for lunch about once a week. They are my favorite truck that we get and we get a lot of really good trucks stopping by. Anyways, I like to try everything on the menu because everything has been really great. I like that they have started branching out beyond just fry bread and serve other things as well.   Lorenzo is really passionate about his food and has been since the first time I met him several years ago at a concert at the Rhythm Room and continues to have the same passion when I talked to him today.   Flavorful good food. I would recommend these guys to anyone!

This place is the best. It's way better than that Chinese restaurant you saw on the Christmas Story. They don't even serve no weird ducks there.   What they do serve are bomb Asian style tapas and amazing entrees for your mouth. Tuesday is a great night to go because they have a tapas deal going. If your significant other is like my wife, they will be thanking you if you take them here for this deal...also feed them some cocktails, SO's like that kind of thing.   I used to go to Johnny Chu's restaurant Fate and most of the entree type dishes are very similar to the dishes that he served at Fate. I'm really glad he put this restaurant together because I was really missing Fate, but Sochu House is even better!

Empire taught me that I'm the biggest sucker in the world...and it's a costly lesson.   We originally called them because our septic backed up and it was 11pm on a Sunday night. I thought I did my due diligence researching and finding a company that handles emergency repairs in the middle of the night.   The guy came out and fixed the problem and quoted me one price that was like without the service agreement and another price about $200 lower with a $16.50 service agreement for one year. I opted for the service agreement and paid about $375 for the plumbing (they snaked the line to unplug it). They also came out and checked my AC later in the week and said it was fine.  The next time they came out to check the AC they replaced the outside blower and added a kickstarter to the unit and charged me about $700. I just found out from my new AC guy that the blower would have been under warranty so they really took me on that job.   Next my plumbing backed up again but this time snaking it didn't work. They had to open up my back patio to replace a pipe and also had to have the septic pumped. Two guys did the job in about 6 hours, a subcontractor pumped the septic and the only part was a wide PVC like pipe. The final bill was just under $4000 and this didn't include patching the patio cement so now there's a giant 3'x1' hole with an exposed pipe in my patio. $1100 of this amount was for the septic to get pumped, about triple what I would have paid had I picked up the phone and called someone myself.   My advice to you, don't buy the service agreement and avoid Empire. And anyone that is saying that they saved a ton with all this preventative maintenance is just a big sucker like me. They come out twice a year to figure out what they need to sell you and replace things even if they're under warranty.

I got take out from here one night for me and my wife. The food was awesome so I just wanted to give these new guys some love on Yelp. We got the cheese appetizer, if you're like my wife and loves anything cheese you'll go nuts over this.  I also wanted to add that the decor is nice. I know this means things to many people...personally I would eat out of a dumpster if the food was awesome, but that's me.

I have been here twice now. It's super good. They did a great job remodeling the place. They use a lot of local ingredients so everything is super fresh and yummy. My wife even bought the strawberry preserves they get from Tucson and she's not even good at eating sweet things. Now if only the rest of the strip mall could class up their act like this place, we'd be in business!

This place makes some tasty pizza and has great prices. I had the lunch special, so two slices of pepperoni and a drink. Well worth the $5.   Their large cheese pizza starts at $8.95 which is a fantastic deal.   My only suggestion to the company would be to save their to go pizza boxes for to go orders. It's probably cheaper and I feel bad wasting a box when I'm going to eat those pizzas up in like 2 minutes flat.

This place has outdone their selves with their sound system. It's a cool little spot to catch a show or in my case play a show. The sound guy is great to work with. The bar rules, they have good prices and probably about 10 local beers on tab. No liquor though so they do a lot of sake mixed drinks. I don't even know what a sake mixed drink is, but I guess it's a real thing so come try one.

My wife and I love heading up to My Pie for their $5 Monday classic pizzas. Their pizzas are delicious and an outstanding value, especially at that price. Our favorites are the Mr. White and Grandma's Pie. All of the specialty pizza's we've had are also great. My favorite on that list is the Spicy Butcher.   I think the thing that puts My Pie on top is their ingredients. And they don't skimp, so you have to be careful not to get carried away and put too much on your pizza creation!   My Pie has a dog friendly patio and have offered my dog a pizza pan of water every time she's come with us. :D  Make sure to sign up for the deal program. They really do give you great discounts and free stuff, not just marketing.

Firehouse is a new hot sub concept where they steam heat their meats and stuff. I've had a few subs from this place and they've all been great. In a strange way the steaming makes the meat taste kind of fluffy, not soggy or wet, but light and fluffy compared to other meats. I think you have to try it for yourself.   I'm kind of on the fence about the round up for firemen thing. It's a great business model because it leads to tax write offs that their customers pay for. It also makes it so that the employees cannot collect a tip. But it's for a good cause so there's that too.  Overall I definitely recommend this place and will be a repeat customer.

I'm super glad there is another great taco shop in the airpark! I went on a Tuesday when they have a $5 lunch combo special. That stuff is an awesome price and a lot of food. I also got a bean, rice, and cheese burrito just so I could try it. It was really good too. They have really yummy tortillas, they are as good as they look. I'd recommend not trying all that food in one sitting like I did, but instead visit the place a few times if you need to try all the things. If you're like me you'll get too full from all that food.   Anyways, I can't wait to go back and get too full again!

Classic Crust is a welcomed addition to our neighborhood. Their pizza is delicious and the crust deserves the honor of being the restaurant's namesake. The sauce is tangy and vibrant and all of their toppings are great, but I would especially recommend the sausage if that's your type of thing.   They garlic knots are a must try, in fact they probably have a Yelp check in offer to give you some free garlic knots on your visit, so yeah, do that!  I should mention they have local craft beers with 1/2 price refills because that's a real deal sealer for us beer lovers...it really encourages you to grab a refill or two on your pint!

I'm not really a panini dude, mostly because they will "Captain Crunch" up the roof of your mouth if they're too dry. Panini Del Sole is on point with their panini's. The texture is just right, toasted, but not burned or too crunch and soft and spongey. One of my favorite things is that most of their sandwiches come with dipping sauce and I'm a dipping sauce fool! (also a hot sauce fool...pretty much any sauce kind of fool.) If these guys roll up to your event/work/fair with their delicious toast bread sangwiches you must try them!

Great new location. They have tons of current issues, best collection of back issues, and lots of toys and collectibles. This is the best spot in the valley for comic books.

Back when I was in college, I loved going to the Mr Goodcents on Broadway and Roosevelt. I guess it has since closed, but I have always made sure to hit up Goodcents any time I'm in the area of one.   Fast forward to now, I've been back in this neighborhood for about 7 years and we have only had 2 Subways close by for sandwiches. I'm kind of a sandwich junky so when I saw this Goodcents open up I was sooooo stoked!!! I had to try it the next day and let me tell you it's up to par with all the other Goodcents I've had.   Here's what makes Goodcents so special, their light and fluffy bread and deli sliced meat. This is what makes it better than the competition. They have a great selection of fresh toppings, but so does everyone else. They have chips and fountain sodas just like everyone else. You can get some fresh baked cookies, same as the other guys. But you have to come here for delicious bread and deli sliced meats...unless you like mediocre bread and meat served up on plastic wrapper things, then you go to one of the 2 Subways in the area.
