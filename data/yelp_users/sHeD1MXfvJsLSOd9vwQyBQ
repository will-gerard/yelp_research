This place is in the lunch rotation. Whenever we decide to go a little further than our usual lunch location radius and  venture into Ahwatukee. It's in a mall (isn't everything anymore) and there's always plenty of parking. You might want to come before noon, though, if you are in a big group and want to sit inside. The place seems to be pretty popular after being featured in dumpsters, divers, and douchebags or whatever that program is called. I don't like going anywhere just because some TV program hyped it up. Might as well eat at McDonald's because you've seen their commercials so many times. Anyway, I've tried most of their street tacos and I'm partial to the marinated pork (Carnitas). Not sure why they have Spanish for most of their menu but instead of Carnitas it's "marinated pork." It is an interesting recipe - includes condensed milk and coca-cola. That's the secret recipe. Well, either the secret's been let out of the bag or it wasn't ever that secret because when I googled Carnitas recipes there were hundreds with  those same two ingredients. Whatever the case, I love that flavor and I'm addicted to it. Is it really the kind of coke you drink or the other kind? Whatever the case, I like it and will keep coming back.

Ok. So we came here on a coworker's suggestion. Don't know why because I wouldn't ask his opinion on anything but my other coworkers figured they could trust him on this one. So here we were - four of us on a Saturday night. The mall was kinda hopping because there were a few spots here that were still destinations at this time of the evening - Asiana Market, Hodori Korean Restaurant, Saketini, and Best Hong Kong Dining. Oh yeah, there's also an Oregano's. So we go into the restaurant and it has a funky layout like a diner where you walk through to the cashier and then they seat you - there are rails that sort of force you to walk past the hanging ducks. This place seems to be known for its duck so I was determined to have some. We were seated and given water immediately - love that delicious chemical flavored local tap water. We then put in our orders and waited a while. Luckily we were entertained by some of the other clientele. There was this dude with extremely glittery shoes. I refrained from taking a photo lest the owner of the glittery shoes figured I was mocking him and ends up being a kung fu expert - breaking out into martial arts and/or a Michael Jackson video. Either way I'd be a goner. Googling "chinese glittery shoes fashion trend" got me nowhere - this guy was clearly ahead of the pack. Then our food finally came. My coworkers got some boring standards like fried eggrolls, rangoons, crab puffs, etc. I got the duck lo mein that somebody mentioned in a Yelp review - thank you fellow yelper! That was a winning dish for me. Awesome juicy duck with tasty skin together with cabbage and noodles. Noodles were a little greasy but the whole thing together was delicious. Gave some pieces of duck to the coworkers and they all were feeling buyer's remorse about their own plates. Place itself has very much a diner like feel to it and service is good but a tad on the slow side at times. I was full by the time I finished my meal. Price is actually very good for what you get - can't complain there. Parking? In a mall with a bunch of other restaurants so you get what you get. Watch out for the people coming from Saketini - those folks wouldn't know the difference between a mall parking lot and Phoenix International Raceway if you hit them on the head with an eggroll. Will I be back? For the duck lo mein in a skipped heartbeat!

Dis place stay serving local kine grinds since 1986 - that stay last century, bra. Everybody else went come late to the Hawaiian BBQ/plate lunch gravy train. L&L was one contendah but now they stay gone from da east side (still get da one in Flagstaff - oops no wait I mean North Phoenix). Ono Hawaiian BBQ, Moki's, Golden Hawaiian BBQ - they all ok but dis place stay da real deal for decades now. When dis blala get homesick dis is da place fo' kaukau li'dat. Even the staff working here speak da kine - pidgin to da max bra, buncha tittas and mokes. That's authentic, bra, I no shit you. So my favorite here is da combo #2 mix plate. That's da one with Chicken Katsu (deep fried chicken cutlet that they went chop up li'dat) and da kine - bulgogi (yobo kine marinated beef). Plus two big blala portion scoops rice and macaroni salad. Many places make da macaroni salad mainland style - this stay Hawaiian style, bra, cannot compare. For drink I went always get da kine Hawaiian Sun juice drinks but now opu too big so gotta get da kine water bottled in Hawaii and blessed by Madam Pele instead. Dis last time I also got da kine, Manapua. Was good - you can get something sorta li'dat if you go eat da kine place dat serve dim sum. Dis one remind me of da kine I used to get fo' twenty five cents from da truck dat came to my school fo' sell dat and rice cake to all da keikis way back in hanabata days. I went come with some folks from my workplace. Da wahine I went come with tried to order one Salmon salad. I went tell her you need either da kine glasses or da kine remedial reading classes. It's Saimin not Salmon. She went give me stink eye - bra, I was just trying fo' help li'dat. Anyway, dis stay part of da lunch rotation li'dat. Plenny parking, bra - same mall as da kine pizza place - Nello's I tink. On weekends they get mo' betta selection - poke and laulau li'dat. Check it out, bruddah! Mo' betta than pig, mo' betta than poi. I give this place da big shaka sign. Hawaii!

Came here once with a coworker for our lunch break and had high hopes because various Yelpers rated it highly as a "New York Style" Chinese food place. So I ordered the pork fried rice, chicken wings and used the packets of duck sauce they had lying around. My coworker is from the east coast so she assured me the pork fried rice and the duck sauce were all part of what you could expect from a Chinese restaurant back East. The food was decent. I wasn't jumping up and down about it but it hit the spot. There were other factors, however, that kind of decided this place's fate as far as being part of our "rotation." Got the fountain drink and it was flat as a tortilla. Blech. Then my coworker grabbed the last set of chopsticks so when the dude behind the counter that we ordered from brought our food, I asked him if I could get a pair of chopsticks. Immediately I figured out what was so "New York Style" about this place. He gave me this look like "hey retard, they're right here - did you even bother to look you lazy gwai-lo?" He pointed to the drawer right at the counter and opened it as if he were instructing a little kid and was probably about to say SEE? HERE THEY ARE! Except, of course, there weren't any. So he turned back to me with an "oh well" look and shrugged. After that he went to the shelves behind the counter and lifted a few boxes here and there and then yelled back "Use a fork!" Customer service at it's finest. LOL. While we sat and ate (we were the only dine-in customers for most of the time we were there) numerous customers would drive up to the front of the store, turn off the engine and order takeout. Perhaps this is a New York thing but there was plenty of parking in stalls where normal people would park. None of these folks were physically handicapped or carrying loads of boxes on a dolly or ordering for the entire office - just personal takeout. But I get it. Old habits are hard to break and perhaps a NY style Chinese restaurant complete with NY style attitude clicks on that NY state of mind - there's parking RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT- HURRY UP AND GRAB IT BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES!!! But even that wasn't enough to sway me. What did it for me and my coworker was the order-taking dork at the counter clearing his throat every few minutes as if he were ready to hock a loogie. WTF!?!?! My coworker and I would look at each other and try not to laugh out loud. Was he adding his own special sauce to all the take-out orders? We never heard the actual "spit" but it was enough to spoil our NY style Chinese lunch. If you really gotta, don't dine in - takeout or delivery for sure.

The lake view is what brings my friends and I to this place for an occasional dinner. Place gets packed so we try to come later than the prime time dinner rush. That really works best on the weekend when the hours of operation are a little longer. So... I've tried a lot of their dishes - Fundidos, Shrimp Enchilada Dinner, etc but once I tried their Shrimp Stuffed Poblano Chiles - that was it! I could never try another dish off their menu. Like the pathetic and predictable crack addict that lives for the next hit I come here and predictably get that each and every single time. I mean it comes with everything I love - shrimp, calabacitas, chiles, melted Monterey Jack cheese and jalapeno-lime cream sauce. So Valle Luna, don't you ever ever ever ever ever take that off the menu or I will walk out of your restaurant for the last time ever after throwing a tantrum that would have even embarassed John McEnroe back in the day. One valid complaint that I'm not alone in (judging from OTHER reviews) is they stopped serving the bean dip with the chips. Now it's just the blander salsa that the chips come with. And now they charge a kidney for the beam dip if you still want it. Well not really THAT much - it's more like just a big toe or something. But they used to give it for free as part of the complementary chips and dip. For that I dock a star - since that awesome dip was a mandatory part of the complete Valle Luna experiece. Lots of parking - shares a mall with Nate's Third Base, Sprouts, Hon Machi Sushi, Coffee Rush, and Pita Jungle.

This Asian supermarket is the one that I usually shop at since it's closest to me although I sometimes go to Mekong instead - it's nice to have choices. All kinds of foods line the aisles - sorted by country or region. Great choice of fruits and vegetables and also lots of fish and meat available. Also a great international beer selection. Whole aisle of bowls and cups and dishes just like at your favorite Asian restaurants. Freezers full of frozen gyoza, shumai, pot stickers, and the like as well as popsicles in all sorts of flavors like coconut, taro and mango. Also - some ready to heat and eat Filipino dishes. The frozen section even has frozen betel nuts if you want a start a new hobby/addiction. And let's not forget our favorite Grace product that gets put on the top shelf in the Jamaican/Carribean section and is usually hidden from view (possibly out of embarassment) - Cock flavoured soup. Last I checked Mekong Supermarket didn't have it but make sure to stock up for the holidays - white elephants and stocking stuffers. For some reason this product never seems to last. Yeah ok :P end juvenile mode. Lots of parking - shares a lot with China Magic Noodle House, Gogi, Phoenix Palace, Heavenly Bakeshop and Catering, Pho Van, Pho 68, Boba Tea House, Gelato 64, Imperial Foot Spa, CVS Pharmacy, and McDonald's. Parts of the parking lot are badly in need of repaving though.

So I stopped by here just the other day for the first time even though it is so close to me. I was running late so I didn't have time to make coffee myself and I knew the whole day would be completely fornicated if I didn't have my coffee that day and since I didn't plan on going postal at work that day I decided to stop and get a sandwich and coffee to go. Staff was friendly and everything went so quick that it felt like I just entered, ordered, and left. That's the way I like Starbucks to be - quick and easy, no fuss, no drama.   10 bucks little man. Put that credit card in my hand.  If that credit card's fo sho. Then you can go and go and go!  And out the door I went. Seemed like a much better day already!

I usually don't do fast food places like Burger King, Wendy's, Carl's Jr. as well as that one Scottish restaurant but this time I felt the need. I was late for breakfast on the way to work and curious to try their cronuts. Wait. WTF are cronuts you say? No not crow nuts. Not the nads of a bird. Not the testicles of Croatian or Cro-Magnon men either. Cronuts are croissant donuts. Wait for it. The Cronut™ brand and product is a registered trademark of Dominique Ansel Bakery internationally. There - so with that out of the way, Crack In The Box can't officially use that term to call them that. So I found myself feeling stupid when I actually went to the drive thru and asked for cronuts. Huhhh??? was the response I got. Oh. I mean "croissant-doughnuts." You know? That freaking pastry formerly known as a cronut? So then she understood and I could pay and GTFO and on my way to work. This location does the credit card slider on the outside so you don't have to give some sketchy degenerate your credit card to actually hold for too long - you just do it yourself. Extra star for that. Now I've never had the real trademark Cronut but I had something that resembles it at a convention once. These that I got from Crack In The Box were donut shaped and not croissant flakey at all. In fact, the outside was indistinguishable from a regular sugar donut. Well, maybe not THAT sugary but still sweet from some sugar and cinammon. I cracked open the package to make sure I actually got 3 croissant doughnuts and not anything else like a chicken head or any of the stuff you hear about in urban folktales/the internets. MMMM. It actually smelled nice and fresh and cinammony. So I get to work and instead of getting straight to work I'm taking pictures of my food. See photo - money shot/centerfold of a croissant doughnut doing the splits. Smelled great and is actually fluffy like a croissant in the middle. Had to try it once. Not sure if I'll ever get the craving for it again but if I do, I know where to go. Nothing personal, Jack. Just rating the croissant doughnuts and nothing else.

So one of our vendors takes us out to happy hour here every so many months. On their dime so very few of my coworkers are no-shows when this takes place. We pretty much always get just appetizers and drinks. Best appetizers IMHO here are the Shrimp Cocktail, Baked Garlic Shrimp, Scallops & Bacon, Prime Rib Sliders, Crab Cakes, and Loaded Nachos. I've also had the filet mignon here a few times when we actually did dinner instead. Cocktails, appetizers, get lit and all on some 3 letter Fortune 200 company's expense account so what's not to like? Makes me slightly biased as I might be a lot more critical if I was shelling out the Benjamins. Service is always good though. Can't complain there. Bathroom's classy. Plenty parking since it's in one of those malls on Chandler Blvd on the outer northern rim of Chandler Fashion Center.

Take anything you want from me, Anything. Fly on little wing.  Came here the other night to try their wings. Got here before my friend did and sat in the crowded dining section in the east wing of the restaurant. Noticed the peanut shells on the floor - sorta creating the same effect as sawdust on the floor at Bill Johnson's Big Apple restaurants. My friend was bragging that this place had the hottest wings he never tried. Wuss. One of his friends tried the hottest wings on sale here and started sweating and crying and could not finish them. Over time and many beers I've heard that same legend over and over stretch to include emergency vehicles, demonic possession, terrorists/US military wanting the recipe so it could be weaponized, fire-breathing and whatnot until I finally said - ok we're going there - I need to know for myself. I ordered the suicide wings - traditional. No waivers had to be signed, nobody standing around with fingers on 911 speed dial button. Seemed like a standard thing to order at this place. Ok. Cool. When the wings came, they looked like any other "hot" wings. Tabasco colored little wings just sitting there waiting for me. Grabbed the first one and took a bite. Tasted vinegary hot sauce - good stuff. But the burn kept up as if all my teeth suddenly grew little wicks and turned into lit candles. Whoa - a CONSTANT burn even after the wing is done. Took the next wing and same thing. Ended up instinctively grabbing my beer to put out the fire. Wow. Perhaps the story had some merit - Teakwood's suicide wings aren't wussy at all like a lot of other places that claim to have super hot wings. When I finally got through all the wings, my friend noticed that I consumed four beers in the time it took him to drink one. Most times we go to a bar it is the exact opposite situation. Our waitress was even nice enough to bring me a tall glass of ice water as well. I'll have to admit, I have recently been on a quest for the hottest wings and most places have failed to impress - haven't finished the quest but I'm putting a flag down here for now as the hottest I've had so far. Was a bit concerned I'd find out the true meaning of "fire in the hole" the next day but fortunately that wasn't the case. Funny thing we got here at peak dinner time and when we left just around 11pm the place was a ghost town. If I didn't see another table of customers in a far corner I would have thought they were closed. They're open till midnight most days except for weekends when they close a little later. Plenty of parking in the mall it shares with Walgreens and Thailicious.

Came here one Saturday evening for some food and drink. So this is like the more well-endowed, prettier sister of Zipp's. A lot of the same menu items as at regular Zipp's locations but they also have a lot more stuff like Filet Mignon, Baby Back Ribs, Fajitas, Meatloaf, Salmon, Broasted Chicken Dinner, Calzones, Pasta, Specialty Pizzas. Also, on tap they have more offerings - one of them being Summer Shandy which I'm partial to. There's even an upstairs although on the night I was there it was closed off for a private party. There's a game room in back. One thing that I didn't see here that most Zipp's have was the TouchTunes jukebox. Really nice quality TV screens all over the place. I'd probably be here much more often if I lived in this area but I will probably be here again someday. The service was pretty good the night we were there even though the place was packed. I indulged in Summer Shandys and also had the artichoke appetizer as the main meal as I wasn't very hungry. Good - sure - but you can't really mess something like this up, can you? Lotsa parking as it's in a big mall. Check it out especially if you're a big Zipp's fan.

So a friend dragged me here to see the Tempe Sound exhibit that shows guitars that various hometown heroes and favorite sons in the Tempe local music scene played. Featured are artists like Hans Olson, Walt Richardson, Gin Blossoms, The Refreshments, etc. There's even a life size evil-looking mannequin of a St. Madness member that I saw a number of rugrats run up to and then run screaming away from. LOL. There was also a synthetic drum set up so you can put on headphones and pound away to your heart's content - which was probably the most popular part of the exhibit with the kids. Afterwards I took a quick look at the regular exhibits. There are a few interactive things you can do on a computer like take a photo of yourself and turn it into a mosaic made from photos of all the folks that did the same thing before you. There's also a virtual "Greetings From Tempe" postcard you can make with your photo and send it to yourself by email. Also going on at the same time was a lego exhibition by Cactus Brick featuring a giant train set, giant castle, and pretty much every space vehicle in the Star Wars series. Right at the entrance there's all sorts of stuff for sale mostly related to either Tempe or the museum exhibits. That day we went there was also a concert event called LOUD IV - featuring the Salt River Brass Quartet, The Stu Siefer Combo, and Bad Cactus Brass Band. There were also a few food trucks: Bang Bang Dumplings, Sweet Magnolias Smokehouse BBQ and Paletas Betty. Didn't try the other trucks but I just HAD to have a Strawberry Cream paleta. Salt River Brass Quartet played first and played a wide range of material - jazz, classical and even pop pieces like their rendition of Pharrell Williams' "Happy" as well as Muse's "Supermassive Black Hole." Stu Siefer's Combo played more straight ahead traditional jazz standards. We didn't stay past that but a good time was had by all. I'll definitely come back for another event like this. Plenty of parking and it's free. Even though it usually closes at 5pm the museum building stayed open longer for the event.

So a coworker who doesn't even really eat Thai food recommended this place because some of her friends like it. "Where is this place?" I asked her. "Right next to the AZ State Government Department of Economic Security!" she told me. Umm. "What's it called?" I asked. "The Siamese Cat" she replied. So someone who doesn't know Thai food is asking me to come with her to a Thai place with a sketchy name in a sketchy area. What could possibly go wrong? So we wandered around the mall looking for the place because we entered closer to Baseline but it was in the northern corner. Mall is full of "for lease" signs - so much for economic security as far as this mall goes. The mall (or maybe the govt?) did shell out some dough for a number of solar panel roofs to provide shaded parking right by the Economic Security building. There's only a few other signs of life other than the Siamese Cat - Merry Maids and Tempe Bloopers. We walk in and there are a few tables occupied. We sit down right near the entrance. We were given soup with cabbage in it for starters. It was alright but a little bland. I ordered the Pad Prik Gaeng and ordered it spicy hot. When the food came I quickly realized that this was a more Americanized Thai food place where they pull their punches when they say "hot". The sauce was also really watery. It sort of reminded me of the time when our cafeteria at work tried to make a "Thai dish". Very bland. Too bad because the lady that served us was really nice. On the bright side, you get a lot of value. I had that and a thai iced coffee for under ten bucks. So if you're a value type person and are new to Thai food, this may just be your place. Your mileage may vary of course. Mine won't - won't be back.

So there is a Starbucks across the street I hung out at once - if I'd known about this place I would have walked across the parking lot. This place has a much mellower vibe than Starbucks. You don't come to this place to be seen - just to hang out and chill and not obsess with the BRAND of your coffee. That said, the barista here seemed way too artificially blissful - like a Stepford wife or something. I should have asked her to put a little of what she was having into my drink. Going to the bathroom here is fun - you sort of go through a maze that takes you past the kitchen and into the back area of the store. Well kept up bathroom - so that's a plus. Lots of parking - same mall as Starbucks, Johnny's Burgers & Dogs, Subway, Kicks Frozen Yogurt, Seams To Be Alterations, Ross Dress For Less, and a bunch of other businesses.

I thought Village Inns were all nighters like Denny's.  This one apparently isn't. Closes by midnight on the weekdays and 2am on weekends. And the late night menu is REALLY stripped down. Pretty much all that's left is deep fried bar food appetizer type stuff. The main edible food choices are the sandwiches. Lots of parking - part of it belongs to the Tutor Time next door though. Of course, that only matters during daytime on the weekdays.  We were pretty much the only ones in the place but somehow they still messed up our order. It was very quickly fixed without a fuss so I give our waiter props for that and for having a very good  sense of humor. Food was just ok. The fried stuff was too greasy for my taste. The sandwich was passable. Had one of their limeades. Blech. I've had cough syrup that tasted better. I Will avoid that stuff completely from now on. One of the things  Village Inn is known for is their pies. Wednesday  is free pie day or something like that. They have  a large selection of pies right at the entrance if  you want to get a pie to go. If you come right around  their closing time, sometimes they have pies that they are not allowed to sell but instead can only give away for free or else throw out - I guess going past their sell by date. So if you really like pie, keep  that in mind. ;)

This is one of my coffee sources before a long day's work. Staff is very friendly and consistent - doesn't seem like there's a lot of turnover here. Quick service and they always have my favorite Chicken salad with Tarragon sandwiches when I actually want to eat something as well. The only bad experience I had here was when some obnoxious fellow kept asking if my name was Dan - I guess he was just trying to figure out  which customer there was his Craigsfist (sp?) connection.

I've been coming here off and on over the years since it used to be right next to the theaters. The theaters are long gone and in place there is a church. The actual store is a lot bigger now. Pretty good selection of books. They have a lot of obscure foreign language/English dictionaries which I thought was pretty cool. That's probably just me though. They have a decent sized collection of vinyl for such a small place. A handful of CDs as well but nothing like the selection you would see at Bookman's. They will buy paperbacks, CDs and vinyl. Prices for what they give you seem a bit random though. Whatever the case, it is worth checking out from time to time.

I'm not big on chains but this one I don't mind. First of all, any chain that actually has snakebites (one part beer, one part cider) on the menu must be doing something right. I've tried every type of pizza on the menu by now but I'm a sucker for the Malibu  Veggie that has spinach, tomatoes and carrots. The  other thing I like about this place is that they're  open late. They close at 2am but the kitchen closes  a little earlier than that. Still, it's the best late  night eats in the neighborhood. Ok - so they may be  the ONLY ones open this late but that still makes  the statement = true. Service has always been decent no matter how crowded it's been. It's in a mall so there's always ample parking.

I gave this place two tries just in case the first impression was skewed since I came late in the day. This is one of 3 locations of a local chain called  Hot Bagels and Deli. It's in the mall with the huge  Home Depot and cheap construction consultants for hire  in the parking lot. The parking right in front of this  place is a bit crowded and crazy during lunch time -  what with it also being home to Subway, Panda Express,  and Senor Taco as well. Lady who took my order had a  slight Central European accent. I had a bagel and a coffee. The coffee you just get from a coffee machine -  no different from what they have at your local Circle K. Both times the bagels were just ok. This last time my  bagel was a little doughy and a bit too salty. Oh well,  I guess I'll stick to Einstein Bros.

Came here after a fine meal at Hana (it's right across the street) since one member of our party was not keen on Japanese desserts that night. I've been to Mary Coyle's before - light years ago but it was in a  different location if I'm not mistaken. The entrance, oddly enough, was in the back. There was an antique car parked in the parking lot so that sort of set the mood for the time tunnel we were about to set foot through when we opened the door to Mary Coyle's. The place was packed. Luckily one group had just got up to leave so we had a booth in the corner that our very chipper waitress directed us to.  Clientele seemed like they could have all been Mayberry residents which added to that time warp effect.     Menu is decent - you can come here for a full meal and not just ice cream. We all went for individual ice cream bowls. Something for everyone - they even have sugar free flavors (vanilla and amaretto). Service was very good. The whole ice cream shoppe atmosphere has gone the way of drive-ins so if nothing else, just to experience this in 2012 was a nice treat.

So I had to move out as the two other folks I was living with had moved on to greener pastures or sunnier beaches in this case. Plus I wanted to move a lot closer to work. So I found these folks through Yelp and decided to give them a shot. The type of cleaning I wanted wasn't what they usually do but I needed someone to do it and fast and these folks were willing so I gave it a go. I had an apartment that looked like a tornado hit it the day after a triple kegger during fraternity rush week. That's what happens when 2 folks move out and you get to do all the cleaning because you're last man standing. At this point I wasn't even worried about how much or how little deposit I was getting back. I was more worried about how much I might owe - as there was some damage. I was able to replace a bunch of stuff - no details as to not incriminate myself but the cleaning was going to be a headache and I had very little time. So Maids Of Honor folks came in for one day to clean it all up. I came to take a look afterwards and was pretty impressed. The bathrooms looked like what you'd walk into when you check into a hotel room. LOL. That's not what they looked like a few days before. Long story short - I actually got the bulk of my deposit back. I was actually shocked when I opened the final statement from the apartment complex. Pretty sure that would not have been the case had I attempted to clean myself in the amount of time I had OR used a lesser qualified cleaning service.

Came here a few times because some of my friends are on a pool league that plays here once in a while. So we sat down and a waitress took our order and that was the last time I saw her that night. WTF. Other waitresses brought our food - which seemed to take a really long time. I just ordered a simple burger not a five course meal from a French restaurant FFS. Anyway, my friend tells me "I love the service here!" "Really?" I asked, quite suprised that he'd say such a thing. "No" he said. And we both laughed. Because the service really WAS a joke. We did finally see our waitress a few times that night but she managed to come by when we DIDN'T need anything because some other waitress took care of us. I wouldn't really give a darn if she hadn't introduced herself to us as "the waitress who will be taking care of us tonight." I suppose I'll be back one day but just for the sake of hanging out with those friends - not because of anything compelling about the bar itself. The pool tables aren't bad though - there I did it - I said something nice about the place. Amen.

Dirty Dogg Saloon is a biker bar in North Scottsdale at the southeastern corner of North Scottsdale Road and East Shea Boulevard. It's in a mall and the entrance is facing the parking lot - usually some security dude that checks your ID stands by the door. Bathrooms are right near the parking lot entrance and there's a pool table as well. In the main bar there are a number of booths, A long table between the booths and the bar and the bar seats have usually been taken every time I've been there - that's really where you want to be sitting if you are able to. There's also a patio but I've never ventured out there - indoors seems to be where the action is. Music playing is also pretty good - mostly rock and roll with occasional rap and country thrown in. Once in a while they play movie clips from cult classics - the type of scenes where everybody knows the lines and sometimes you hear people shouting them out. The real show, however, is when anywhere from one to four bartenders climb up on the bar and start doing their dance. Sometimes they dance with hula hoops that glow in black light. Sometimes they swing from the rafters and shake everything they've got. Sometimes they swing from the rafters WHILE hula hooping. I might add that all the bartenders who swing from the rafters as well as the waitresses that bring your drinks are dressed very lightly - not business casual but work from home when it's scorching hot in the summer kinda casual. If you look up on the ceiling you can see a whole lotta brassieres of all sorts of shapes, colors and sizes - like someone raided a Goodwill and hung their loot on all the beams above the entire bar area. So that said, this might not be the place to take your mom (unless she's a biker chick) or anybody that might be a little too uptight to hang out in a joint like this. Place is like a strip club without the stripping. Yeah, yeah - you can compare it to Coyote Ugly and all that. It takes some acrobatic skill to do what these bartenders are doing so I would say it's a lot more than just doing the Coyote Ugly thing - kicking it up a notch actually. Rafter swinging ain't the only thing going on though - Tuesday nights they do karaoke, Wednesday nights they do wet t-shirt contests, Thursday nights they have live music. I found the mixed drinks to be rather pricey so bottle beer is the best value choice. Clientele - bikers, tourists, all sorts of folks. I don't think there's any other place in the Phoenix metro area like it. We'd probably go a lot more often if it weren't such a long drive. Your mileage may vary.

I remember when Rawhide was way up north. It seemed more fun then - especially when this wild west lady was following our group around and heckling every single one of us. Came here recently for the Riverwalk Wine & Food Festival @ Rawhide. That was a complete clusterfarkle requiring most people to stand in the hot sun for an hour just to purchase tickets to get in. Line was so slow moving we thought every customer got a "happy ending" before proceeding to the festival grounds. Every staff member associated with the festival complained how disorganized it was. We didn't stay too long - just long enough for me to get fecal-faced enough to shout weird things out the window at every pedestrian on our ride back - or so they claim. But really the Rawhide folks aren't to blame - in fact they should be commended for entertaining us in line when they weren't actually even part of the festival. One of the Rawhide guys let a prop gun go off loudly - startling everyone around and blamed it on a car nearby backfiring. LOL. I thought it was hilarious.  Enough about the "festival" I came a little while back with a co-worker to the actual Steakhouse and we had some pretty good steaks. For appetizers we had rattlesnake fritters and mountain oysters. They give you a lot of both. Waitress claimed we were being brave that night. LOL. My co-worker just kind of had a bit of both so I ended up eating most of the apps. I had so many balls and pieces of snake in my mouth it was like I was at a lemonparty or something. LOL. The band playing country music that night was pretty good too. I'd go again if I had an out-of-town visitor that wants the whole wild wild west experience. Lots and lots of dirt parking.

Yeah so this Starbucks location is close to work. I come here to grab a Tarragon Chicken Salad sandwich and a coffee. Parking is ok if you come early in the morning before the Habit wakes up. Service is pretty good although the drive-thru window takes priority. Never too crowded - just your usual poser with laptop or ipad hanging out. There's also seating outside. I'm a to-go type so that doesn't matter much. They are consistently quick, never messed up an order and that's what keeps me coming back.

Ok. As much as I don't want to admit I have a favorite ANYTHING ending with B-E-R-T-O-S, this is it. I've eaten at this Filiberto's over the years more than any other location in the state. Pretty much because it's close to work and it's the place to go when I want to go to lunch by myself because I'm on a time crunch and brain meltdown and don't want to hear any work gossip or anyone's damn problems or anyone bitching about this, that and the other thing. Me, a carne asada burrito, an horchata and fornicate the rest of the planet - this is MY time. Cellphone off. World will have to wait. Sometimes I'll get the Carnitas plate. Quesadillas are pretty good too. That's about all I get here. Plenty of parking for this location - same mall as Fry's, Miele's, Pei Wei, Habit, Petco, Jamba Juice, and Starbucks among other things. I've been here at night but atmosphere is a little less inviting and a bit sketchier. I just get it to go! Better to come inside too. Freaking drive through line becomes long as hell at night. Cool thing here is the desserts. When they haven't run out of it, I get the flan. Not the best in the world but fork it, it's FLAN!!!! Sorta like what they say about sex - even when it's bad it's still good. I wouldn't really know - gotta get out of my mom's basement more often... Oh yeah. This place is cool during World Cup time because every freaking TV in the place is tuned to the game of the hour. And the place get's packed - people staying to see the end of the game long after they finished their lunch. LOL. Mexican place like this is more likely to have their TVs tuned to soccer than them gringo places - just sayin'.

I've been coming here since it was in the location where The Habit is in now.  Decent size food portions and always  satisfying. I almost always notice people from my place of employment here so this isn't one of the lunch places where my  lunch buddies can really come and safely bitch about everything that goes on in our little slice of paradise. I usually get the curries - they're all good. And a bunch of us back at the license plate factory all  agree that the Orange Chicken here destroys Panda Express' version like the fist of an angry god pounding a demon back to hell  through the earth's crust. Place can get crowded during lunch - sometimes people have to wait for tables before they can sit down. Parking is always plentiful though since it's in a big mall. I think they had more space at the old location but what can ya do? Owner is pretty cool guy and very entertaining. If you  catch him during a rare occasion when he's mackin'  be sure to take notes, son.

I've come here twice - both times by chance. Someone was going to see Radiohead and her date flaked out last minute. Then a co-worker had an extra ticket for the Coyotes that she couldn't find a taker for it at the last minute. Both times I had a great experience. This last time was in our compay's luxury suite. Had a great view of the game. Anaheim Ducks ate our Coyotes for breakfast though so we left with about five minutes left in the game to avoid the mass rush. This last time food and drinks were provided so can't really comment on the experience of dealing with the concession stands. Parking - pretty well organized for something on this scale even though it is pricey - fifteen bucks. Good times.

Came here by Lyft with a friend after coming from an open bar event so I was already several sheets to the wind. My friend had been here before and said it was a pretty good karaoke place so I went with it. Bar was ok - not all that great of a beer selection and so-so service. Clientele seemed to be locals/regulars who knew each other and the DJ. Karaoke DJ was pretty damn uptight though. House rules are you can't cuss on the little stage they have - so no songs with profanity. Their song selection already seemed pretty weak so I figured they had already weeded out all the songs that had any bad words. Then some guy started singing Closer by Nine Inch Nails and I suppose the DJ was not familiar with the song because right when it got to the part that goes "I want to f*ck you like an animal" she stopped the music and would not continue until the singer promised to substitute the word "truck" in place of the offending word. It was ok for anyone in the audience to sing the correct lyrics but not the main singer on the stage. That put a damper on things for me - not like there were little kids in the audience as it was a 21 and over bar. Seriously WTF, chuck? Probably won't be back. Truck this place.

Took two tries to actually eat here. First night (Sunday) I tried to make a reservation and they told me after the waiting list gets long enough, they stop taking reservations - you better just show up and get on the list. So we tried again Monday. This time we showed up in person and got on the list. Not too hard to spot - if you're travelling eastbound on Sahara heading away from the Strip you'll eventually see the backside of a dingy mall and LOTUS OF SIAM quite visible on the wall on the south side of Sahara. You then make the next turn and find a parking spot in the mall close to the restaurant. Shouldn't be hard at night since most of the businesses are either closed or not anywhere near as busy as Lotus Of Siam. We had about an hour's wait and the waiting area only has a few chairs so we decided to venture the mall outside. The rest of the mall is mostly Korean bars or restaurants plus a few sketchy "clubs." None of the restaurants seemed to be "hopping." Lotus Of Siam probably had more people in it than all the surrounding businesses combined. There were lots of shuttered businesses - perhaps this was once a thriving Koreatown in Las Vegas but this mall's best days are definitely in the past. Maybe it's a lot more thriving during the day but walking around there at night gave me a kinda creepy vibe. So we circled the whole place and came back and were seated not long after. I guess some folks couldn't wait any longer and left as a few names the hostess called out did not produce any acknowledgement from the people still sitting and waiting. There were so many people in the restaurant that when we finally got seated almost elbow to elbow next to the people at the tables on either side it felt like we were in a crowded diner. Couldn't they just buy out one of the bigger empty lots around and expand? So anyway, we ordered the crispy duck in Panang curry, the crispy garlic prawns, and our squeamish pal ordered the Panang curry with chicken. The crispy duck was awesome. So were the prawns - you eat the whole thing - shell and all - as we were instructed by our waiter. The Panang curry with chicken was rather lackluster in comparison but that was pretty much eaten by our unadventurous buddy who won't eat seafood and for whom duck was too exotic. Based on the first two dishes I'd say this place lives up to the hype. Portions weren't overly huge and the price was a little steep but we left satisfied. We'll probably be back one day. I'll say it would probably be worthwhile to check this place out if you're actually quite familiar with Thai food. Especially if you flew in from out of town - paying a king's ransom for cab fare from the strip and back as well as the long wait will seem much more worth it.

Been here twice now. Excellent service each time. Also this is a great hotel for a convention since that is what I came for. Very spacious convention area. The room I had was very luxurious and very relaxing after a day of training, schmoozing, and cocktails. It's the type of room you can always completely relax in - so much space. Can't really comment on the price as I wasn't paying - but a big thank you to my employer for footing the bill. Would definitely do it all over again. Love the  whole Venice theme. I like the casino here and the restaurants as well. This is also just the right part of the Strip to be in. Viva Las Vegas!

So I came here with a friend to see Billy Idol. Did not try any of the food, drink, or even relieve myself while there. Did not pass go or collect 200 - went straight to the floor area right near the stage and pretty much had an awesome view of the stage for the whole show. Was told by the box office employee earlier that a line usually starts about an hour before doors open. Sure enough there were already 20 people in line when we showed up. Billy Idol had already done a few weeks of shows in residency so all the bugs were worked out and the show itself was flawless other than a faulty mic. Place can hold a few thousand and after all the added Dickheadmaster (or whoever) fees it's just a little under hundred. Other seating costs more. You do the number crunch. Place was packed and he played all his hits. For souvenir collectors - Steve Stevens just stands there after the encore throwing out hundreds of his personalized guitar picks. Thought that was pretty cool. So for the concert experience I had that night at the House Of Blues - I give this place a five as far as an up close and personal place to see a show. In the Mandalay Bay. Come early. Worth every penny.

This is my backup place for lunch when there is no time for a "sit down and be served" type of lunch. You can either eat here or take it to go. Service is very fast.  It's cheap too. I usually get one of the pork Bánh mì sandwiches and a Vietnamese yogurt. It's in a strip mall so there's always lots of parking. Lots of seating inside too - even when it's crowded. They have a TV tuned to a news channel in the seating area. Been coming here for ages.

On the work lunch rotation for sure. Funny thing. You can name any of the OTHER places on our lunch rotation and if I'm in a MOOD, I might just say bugger off, I ain't going. Call yo momma if you wanna cry about it but I don't care. Mention Famous Dave's and it's like Ali Baba shouting out Open Sesame! All of a sudden my mood changes and I am so THERE! Mind you this is even if I'd just been here earlier in the week. I'm a sucker for BBQ. That ain't no lie. No go dickie die! So I've lost count how many times I've been here. Sure, count my check-ins but I forgot how many times I didn't even BOTHER checking in. So anyway, we always come in big numbers. Well, no less than 5 usually. We know the drill, corporate video trains the servers to make a stupid happy face on the little plate with the sauces for us to dip the potato chips in. One of us usually hides the plate to prevent that from happening. LOL. I usually get the St. Louis Spare Ribs. That's right. Pork ribs. I am male, hear me roar. Arrrrr!!!!!!! Beef ribs are for metrosexuals and grade schoolers. PORK. RIBS. The Jews and Muslims knew what they were doing keeping their folks away from the Devil's meat. PORK. RIBS. The Devil's fingers we call em'. Every bite gets us one step closer to artery clogging hell. But you gotta live sometime, right? So anyways, this is a great place to do it. A religious shrine to pork. If there's any BBQ chain that's doing it right it's Dave's. Right off that street that circles around Chandler Fashion Center - Dave's has its own lot with plenty of parking. As long as the spirit is willing and the pig flesh is tasty I'll be coming back here again and again.

Katz, Carnegie, and the late Stage (R.I.P.) - that's my personal pecking order of how the famous NY Delis rate - mainly for their pastrami sammiches. When I was in New York, I went to Carnegie and found it odd that all the waiters seemed to be Chinese dudes. Well, here in the Las Vegas branch of the Carnegie Deli in the Mirage that still was the case - all the male waiters were Chinese. The female waitstaff were a mixed bag. But all of that is neither here nor there I just thought it was odd but amusing. We ordered the Pastrami sandwich and ended splitting one sandwich among two people. The pastrami sandwich itself was very good and juicy. I also liked the salted pickles on the side. But even though we split the sandwich, the portions were still huge and we barely could finish our "halves". I'd highly recommend splitting with a friend - unless you're one of those "Man versus Food" folks and pride yourself on being able to finish food challenges where the portions are ridiculously huge. If you ARE one of those folks, don't forget to stop by the Heart Attack Grill on Fremont later for those octuple bypass burgers with 40 bacon slices and a free trip to Sunrise Hospital.

So I've been going to this Chino Bandido place off and on for a number of years. Great concept - Chinese/Mexican (Con)fusion without any pretense. At the original location by the horsey races they give Chino Bandido virgins the whole flavor sample deal - you almost get a full meal just trying all the different possible fillings. So in this Chandler location I didn't notice that whole ritual. It is more of just figure out what you want and fill out the order sheet.     The order sheet seems to trip up a lot of folks. It ain't rocket science or quantum finance, folks. Don't even look at the sheet. Figure out what you want to eat first and then look at the sheet (see photo) and figure out  how to express that.    It's easy. You get 14 items to choose from: Carnitas, Chile Relleno, Chinese BBQ Pork, Egg Foo Yung, Gringo Chicken, Hengrenade Chicken, Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, Jerk Chicken, Emerald Chicken, Teriyaki Chicken, Veggie Salad, Pollo Diablo, and Machaca. Got all that? Now you can choose to get this as a rice bowl,  combination, Quesadilla, or Burrito.     For the rice bowl, you just choose one item with steamed rice or optional beans as well. You can also add fried rice for 75 cents.    For the combo, you can choose two different items (it says 1-20  but I think they meant 14) and circle either BLK for Black or REF for  refried beans. Then you also choose what type of fried rice you want.  JFR for Jerk Fried Rice, CFR for Chicken Fried Rice, PKFR for pork  fried rice, and PLFR for plain fried rice. This is pretty much the  full-on big plate. You can also get the items in either a burrito or  a quesadilla by specifying a Q or B. This way you get a burrito or quesadilla in addition to your fried rice and beans.     You can also get items as Quesadillas. You can mix more than one item together if you're daring. Same with the burritos.     You can also order the rice and beans as a separate side if you  didn't get the rice bowl or combo and wanted it anyway. You can get it as a pint or quart as well if you want to take some home.    Finally, the cookies. You get a free cookie anyway but if one ain't enough they have a space for you to order half a dozen or a dozen.    Drinks - pretty much self explanatory. I like this place. I don't need an endorsement by Guy Fieri to justify my liking this place. This is  an occasional lunch outing with co-workers when the mood strikes. Lately I've just been getting Quesadillas and Burritos and skipping the whole rice and beans thing. I don't need to fall asleep in any meetings thank you. :) One thing about this location - even though you don't need  higher education to fill out the order form you might still need a  sextant, compass, telescope, and charts to find the place. The Google map makes it look like it is right on Chandler but it's deep southeast  into the mall. Lots of parking but not necessarily right next to the place during the lunch rush.

A nice break from the psychosis that is the Las Vegas strip. We decided to walk off all the crap we consumed over the past few days. We walked east from the strip starting at Caesar's Palace and down Flamingo Road for what seemed to be miles and miles but really just about 40 minutes or so. The National Atomic Testing Museum is on the south side of Flamingo Road between Palos Verdes street and Swenson street. If you walk, you get to pass and ogle the burnt out remains of the Hotel Key Largo that suffered a four-alarm fire back in March. That's actually a nice preparation for going to an Atomic Testing museum. This type of museum is probably not for everyone - definitely not for kids below the age of literacy as most of the exhibits are accompanied by lots of text explaining the history and details behind each exhibit. If you've been to such places as the Titan Missile Museum in Tucson, ground zero in Hiroshima (Atomic Bomb Dome), took one of the biannual pilgrimages to Trinity Site near Socorro, New Mexico, or watched and enjoyed The Atomic Cafe - than this place is definitely something you want to see. Also, if you're retired and have nothing better to do that's also a good enough reason as I've witnessed here. I didn't do the Area 51 thing. Just did a slow walk through of all the exhibits, watched all the old black and white broadcasts - sorta reminded me of grade school social studies class back in the day. Also had fun with the geiger counter exhibit where you get to test different things. The gift shop sells Trinitite as souvenirs. The lady working there reassured us there is some radioactivity however it's nothing more than what a cellphone gives off. So yeah, I sleep with it under my pillow now. Sweet Atomic Dreams.

What's the best place in the neighborhood if you want a burrito or some street tacos? The answer depends on what time it is. If it happens to be before 11PM, it's Taqueria Mi Casita - they just changed their hours as they used to close at 10PM most days. If you missed that window, there's still Los Favoritos on Chandler and Dobson, NE corner. And if you missed that window, you're stuck with 24/7 places like Filiberto's or Amado's. I like this place because you can see them make your burrito or tacos to order right in front of you. I tried most of their meats but I'm partial to their carnitas - it's tastier than their carne asada. You can add as much as you want of condiments and extras and they don't nickle and dime you for sour cream or guacamole like a lot of other places do. The guys there always greet me with "hey friend" and that's cool with me. Prices are pretty cheap and you definitely get some value - your buck does some banging! I sometimes also get their "Grandmother's Flan" if I'm craving some flan - there's is about as good as anyone else's. Used to come here for lunch a lot but I guess word got out and they always seem to be busy - there's not a whole lot of seating there. Lots of parking - Same mall as Tao Garden, Tokyo House, and Video Paradise.

Came here with a group because even though we were in a mall with mostly Asian food options everyone wanted "Western food." So we walked in and were told immediately that there was a 15 minute wait. So we waited with all the other suckers in the entranceway. When we were taking to the back finally The place we were seated was in the back patio where the misters were running full blast. So I shared a pizza with some other folks. Real basic pizza - pepperoni. When it came I noticed it was very salty. Luckily I was sharing so I didn't have to eat all of it myself. Really, the quality was on par with Chuck E. Cheese or some other place like that where the food is not the main reason for your attendance. The soft drink I was drinking from had a slightly flat taste. Service was very good, though. Probably the only thing I can complement the place on. Really makes me wonder why there are long lines to get in. Meh. I won't ever do this again. I'll be the sole dissenting voice if our group ever brings up this idea again. Lots of parking - in the same mall as Saketini, Hodori, Asiana Market, Best Hong Kong Dining, and Szechuan Express.

Your Mexican grammaw won't necessarily jump up and down screaming "¡Muy Auténtico!" but this place still delivers. Standard Mexican fare with pretty decent service. If you check-in on Yelp, you get a 5 dollar off your meal coupon. I really like the hot sauce that comes with the chips and salsa. Spicy and very flavorful. And the Mango Margaritas - nice and stiff. Their entrees are good especially the enchiladas. And I usually get a side of the calabacitas. They're open till 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays which is usually when I actually make it over here. A late dinner after some event.  Parking is always good since it's a mall.

I see folks dissing this place because it's  in the shell of some old diner type place. No shit, Sherlock. This wasn't formerly the Taj Mahal but who gives a rat's derriere anyway? I come here for the food. Once after eating here I tried all the other Indian restaurants in the neighborhood. They were just ok in  comparison. A few have even gone out of business since then. One of them that shares the first part of the name had food so bland the only flavor seemed to be salt. Even the rice it came with was just plain - like it was minute rice or something. And on top of that, they had a really obnoxious belly dancer. What the heck is up with that? A belly dancer? Isn't that like walking into Lolo's and seeing freaking Riverdance being performed? But back to the Village... Parking here  is always easy - lots of space. Often times my  group is the only group of people not of South  Asian origin. That usually speaks to authenticity  if you go for that sort of thing. Love their mint  chutney dip for the papadams. The other dip that  comes with them is too sweet - I usually leave it  alone. They have a guy that's got a Tandoori oven  and knows how to use it. Any of the Naans are always  a sure thing. I'm a sucker for Vindaloo though. I've  tried this same dish in multiple places in the general vicinity - several square miles or so - and haven't  found one that has just the right flavor like the  way this place makes it. If you get bored while eating, you can catch up with the latest Bollywood hits playing on the TVs in the place. Don't forget to take a spoonful of after dinner mint/fennel seeds combo to freshen your breath before you leave.

So this place is pretty darn heavy on my rotation. I've come here in big groups, small groups, by myself - and this place never disappoints. It does get crowded so I try to usually come here after 1pm when the crowd dies down a bit. This is yet another place where I constantly run into groups of people from my workplace. Heck we might as well just hold all our meetings here. Maybe the attendance would improve.   Parking is never a problem as it's part of a big mall. Service is always pretty good even if the  place is packed. Probably because this place has so many regulars. I know folks that come here more than once a week. I usually go for the lunch special -  posted right at the entrance. The lunch menu is not that big so the specials are often the thing to try. If not for the specials I go for the red curry.  Nice and spicy. Oh yeah. You start out with a salad buffet with peanut sauce dressing. You can also get soup with that. Very reasonably priced for all you  get.

Came here to see "Radio Free Albemuth" one Sunday afternoon. The great thing about Sundays is that Tempe parking meters all have the day off. Woo hoo! Didn't find one on Mill but turned the corner on 5th and found one immediately. Even though this is the red-headed stepchild of the Harkins family they still accept all the Harkins gift cards and free popcorn tickets so I loaded up for a good time. I don't think I've ever seen this theater packed in all the times I've been here and this time was no exception. I'm a theater half-empty kinda guy. The less people, the less chance some nitwit is going to talk on a cellphone, sit right in front of me together with his Bride of Frankenstein hairstyle girlfriend or shoot up the movie theater like there was no tomorrow. I'm more likely to come here when this is the only place showing the movie I wanna see so hopefully they'll continue bringing in that type of movie.

Ah Serrano's. Been to the Serrano's on Guadalupe right next to Pink Pepper a bunch of times back in the day before they closed. It was in our lunch rotation at work for a while until somebody asked what the "Mexican Delight" on the specials menu was and the smart alecky gal in our group pointed at the balding and chubby Mexican dude in our group and yelled out "He's the Mexican Delight!" We watched in slow motion as the cute young waitress tried very hard to suppress laughter but it was a deep belly laugh and she had no way of winning. After she lost the battle she had apologized profusely for laughing at that and that ended up being the last time Mexican dude went out with us whenever smart alecky gal was going with us as well. Fast forward to December 2014 - we have a company gathering in one of the many banquet rooms at the Chandler Downtown Serrano's. I was quite familiar with the food and knew what to expect - standard hot plate gringo Mexican food that my parents would associate with Mexican food. No matter - I had the beef chimichangas, hard shell chicken tacos, flautas, and even jalapeno poppers. The running joke with the jalapeno poppers was that all the Mexican folks in our group thought they were chicken nuggets and only the non-Mexicans knew what they really were right away. Drinks were flowing as well as our company gave everyone 2 drink tickets. I had 2 gin and tonics with Tanqueray. They gave us all an extra round so I wanted the same thing but was informed they were all out of gin which I found unusual since they even asked which type of gin I preferred. Was there a freaking gin tasting event in the next banquet room or something? WTF! But I believe we all left happy with food and drink in our bellies as well as being entertained by the Jest Murder Mystery Company based in St. Louis. My rating is for this particular experience as I don't really frequent Serrano's anymore. Just south of the Arizona avenue and Boston Street intersection. Plenty of parking the night we went but might not be the case when some Chandler Downtown event is going on.

So our go to place for Eyetalian had always been Rigatony's. However, the success of that place in it's new location makes it impossible to go there on our lunch break and not go overtime. I have no problem but some other folks that join in our lunch rotation are not okay with it - especially when there's anything over a 15 minute wait. That's what happens when you go to lunch with those hourly folks :P So luckily we found another Eyetalian place that is also very reasonably priced as far as their lunch entrees go. It is also not crazy busy during lunch whenever I go. Dinner is another story but lunch is quiet and mellow. Can't even remember how long I've been coming here - off and on but I've had the white pizza, some items that were "specials" back when they still had that for the lunch menu, and lately the lasagna. I was once here for dinner - sitting at the bar and was given a complementary piece of tiramisu. Wow. Haven't had a bad meal here - not that I'm hoping to or expecting to. Over the years ownership has changed but the dining experience has been consistent. Place is in the mall that houses a Fry's, The Habit, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, Pei Wei, Filiberto's, and a bunch of other businesses so there is lots of mall parking. Actual location is just south of Fry's in the same building.

So there's this place right across the street from my favorite Korean restaurant Chodang that looks like some kind of converted motel or something. Plenty of parking if you keep driving through the parking lot till you find a space. You walk inside and there's  a number of Mexican shops inside and lots and lots of seating and  tables. Feels like you just crossed the border into Mexico. But the  main star of this show is the taco and torta shop Tortas Ahogadas  Guadalajara. I love a good torta every now and then - this may not  be Los Reyes de la Torta but it probably is the closest thing to it  you'll find in Chandler. I had the torta named after the place - Torta  Ahogadas. They have some soft drinks in bottles but if you want some  fresh Mexican fruit drinks or Horchata you just need to get it at the  place right next to it. Not sure if they take credit cards - I just  paid with cash. You get the little number stands so they can see where the order needs to be delivered. My torta was delivered by a lovely  dreamy tattooed angel - of course, I could've been hallucinating since I was starving. My torta came in a dish and was soaking in sauce -  pretty much ate it with fork and knife. After we finished our tortas  the same sweet woman brought us a complimentary taco cut in two to share.  It was delicious. Real casual place. I think my dining partner and I were  the only non Spanish speaking folks in the entire place. ¿Muy Auténtico?  Si! Will definitely be back!

I've only come here on expense account funded dinners and lunches because this place is perfect for that. I you ever need a place to take a really big group of people, this place can accomodate but you probably need to make reservations in advance as it is a popular place. Service has always been very decent. Can't speak to the prices since it's usually some big boss footing the bill. I've come here enough to have tried most of the Firebirds Specialties - Wood Grilled Salmon, Steak Au Poivre, Pecan Crusted Trout, and American Kobe Meatloaf. All were pretty good though I think I've had the meatloaf more times than any of the others. They have salads and burgers as well - something for everyone. I think we once hung out at the bar area where they had these huge jars of pineapple slices as well - so this place accomodates pretty well if your party wants to still hang out after the meal is done and plates are cleared off the table. Parking - pretty big mall so you'll find a spot without a problem even if it isn't right next to the restaurant. I know I'll be back. :)

I'm the Duke!!! THE DUKE!!!! OMGWTFBBQ! But no. Duke be not proud. The REAL regulars don't have that obsessive compulsive urge to check in at every little place they just pass through or pass gas at. So yeah - it's the neighborhood bar and I can stumble home from here. What's not to like? And of course, when it's that close you tend to drink a little more - especially when there's no need to worry about a DUI. I have a friend that comes here because he doesn't want to drink alone at home - 'cause THAT means you're an alcoholic. LOL. So he gives me a call and we both come here to avoid being alcoholics. Place is in the same mall as CVS Pharmacy, Chase Bank, and Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria. As far as the menu - I think their burgers are decent. I stay away from the onion rings though - too thickly breaded for my taste. Pizza slices are decent and so are the wings. Haven't tried any of the salads - maybe someday when that testosterone deficiency kicks in. Haven't tried any of the desserts either - chocolate and beer just don't mix too well. Beers - they have Dos Equis on tap - comes with a slice of lime. Also Blue Moon - comes with an orange slice. Gotta get your Vitamin C somehow, right? Also there's the Zipp's version of margaritas - Zipparitas. As in Zipparita doo dah Zipparita day. All sorts of flavors like watermelon, peach, chambord... Oops. Forgot what the other flavors were... got a disk read error from my noggin - must have had too many of those Zipparitas. Service is always pretty decent. Or maybe it just becomes that way when you start to know the waitresses by name. And they have one of those TouchTunes jukeboxes. Just get the TouchTunes app, find the most obnoxious song in the catalog you can find that isn't filtered for this location and play it multiple times - hilarity ensues. Just kidding. Me do that? No way. Not unless I was hammered or something.

So yeah, this is my neighborhood pharmacy. Booze. Stationery. Hallmark cards. Some stuff that passes for food. And don't forget the pharmacy. Very friendly lady working the front that greets everyone and wishes them a good day when they leave. That's what I like about this place. Old School Mayberry RFD shit that you don't see much of anymore. That old five and dimer spirit. And the pharmacy folks know their stuff too. There's even some candy there in the pharmacy. Eye candy. Enough said. Plenty of parking 'cause it's a mall. Right next to an Autozone, Zipp's, Chase Bank, Jimmy and Joe's Pizzeria.

So when I have a craving for naengmyun this is the place I found to be the best in the metro area to satisfy it. And no - not because of that  goofy KPOP naengmyun song stuck in my head or  anything. I just get a craving for it every now  and then.  They do the usual cutting of naengmyun  noodles with scissors and you can add vinegar and  mustard to taste. They have a decent spread of  banchan and service is pretty good. The restaurant  doesn't look like much from the outside but it's  pretty nice inside. Don't freak if there's no  parking on the Arizona Avenue side. Just go around  the corner and you will find a lot more parking.

VALUE. That's what this place is about. Best pizza and wings I ever had? Probably not. No matter. I usually get their special - wings, pizza, and a drink. I can never finish that. Their "serious slice" is pretty damn serious. Giant slice off a giant pizza. That should be a meal in itself but I still get the wings anyway. I usually get that for lunch so it becomes lunch AND dinner basically. Can't beat that with a stick or a 2 by 4. That's all I ever had here. I'm not someone who eats lot's of pizza and often but it's good to have a place like this when you need a quick meal in a pinch. Service is usually decent. Lotsa parking since it's in a mall with Chase Bank, Autozone, CVS PHarmacy, and Zipp's.

I have a "don't ask, don't tell" policy when it comes to Filipino food. I don't ask what it is but I'll point at it. You just serve it to me  and don't tell me what it REALLY is. This is true for this place. I've been coming here for a while for lunch. Sometimes with a friend and sometimes it's just me alone. I usually get the pork adobo, the Diniguan and two scoops of rice. Diniguan is one of those things you don't want  to really know about if you're squeamish. But it sure is good. I know this type of stuff definitely ain't what the doctor ordered but my shrink says  go ahead if it makes you happy - and it does. It's in a strip mall with lots and lots of parking. Been to the next closest Filipino place around in the Mekong Plaza and this place has a much better  selection and better atmosphere in my opinion.  Where else can you catch up on all the latest bizzare  Filipino TV shows?

So this is a Japanese-owned sushi place. That might seem like a silly thing to mention but I've been to so many Korean-owned sushi places lately that I take notice when a place is actually truly Japanese. I don't mind the Korean places just like I don't really care if a pizza place is run by  Albanians instead of actual Italians. But there are some menu items that you will only find in a Japanese run sushi place. The Japanese run places are less  concerned with all sorts of fancy "rolls" and are likely to give you smaller sushi pieces because sushi is supposed to be "hitoguchi" - meaning one bite and it all fits in your mouth. Some of the Korean sushi places give you huge pieces of fish that you can no way fit all in your mouth in one bite. Sure you get your  money's worth but that's really not the point.    So I've been coming to Hana off and on for quite some time. Sometimes the place is too crowded and our group ends up sitting outside. It's nice if it isn't too hot or windy because it is much more quiet than in the actual restaurant.     For appetizers, the kaki is pretty good if you're into oysters. Agedashi tofu is also usually a good choice. I was a little disappointed with their yakibuta - I guess only  because I had a killer variation at another restaurant which  I can't help comparing it to.     Sushi is always pretty decent and fresh tasting here. It's pretty much what I come here for. I just check off the items on the sushi list and let them roll in. If you get the eel sushi, that is usually the last item that comes because it is considered a little sweet because of the sauce - so that's like a dessert.     Speaking of desserts, I always get the Hana An Mitsu - aloe vera, mandarin oranges, blueberries, and red bean paste with  a cherry on top. Most restaurants won't have this but this is definitely a very Japanese dessert. Tottemo Oishii desu.     Parking is easy to find since it's a mall but there's a bunch of restaurants in the same mall so you might not be parking close to the restaurant.

I usually come here with coworkers for some special occasion lunch - like a birthday or something like that. Also a few happy hours for leaving coworkers. As far as food that I've had here - the Japanese Ahi Rice Bowl was pretty good. Can't go wrong with Ahi and every time I've had it, it's been fresh. I also had their Misoyaki Fire Grilled Salmon which was pretty good as well. I must say of all these Chandler Mall/Chandler Blvd Strip restaurants we  frequent for company functions - Majerle's, Keg,  Firebirds, Chili's - this place has my favorite menu.  And I like the layout of the place as well. We usually park in the back - south part of the restaurant and enter via the secret back door entrance on the southeast corner - "sneaking in" as the waitresses who catch us say. Service has usually been decent. We're usually too caught up in conversations to notice so we'd really only notice if it was bad and that hasn't been the case.

Not sure why but my coworkers love this place and we end up doing happy hours here a lot. Place can get pretty packed on a Friday night. I remember a bunch of years back they had boxtys on the menu but that is no longer something you can get here. Bummer! I usually end up getting the Shepherd's Pie and they give you a lot of bang for your buck so I walk out of here quite stuffed. Shepherd's Pie is pretty good - sometimes a bit on the salty side - sorta unpredictable. The Irish brown bread that comes with it is awesome though. Who knew that a few slices of bread with butter on it can bring such joy?? Beer selection is pretty decent - changes from week to week. Fridays usually there's a band playing. Keltic Cowboys are good. One night was trivia night. Another night was ska night which was cool until a brawl broke out. I think that might have soured some of us on this place because we haven't been back since. But I'm sure I'll be back someday. Closest Irish pub to where I live. Lotsa parking as it's in a mall.

Yucca Tap Room - been around for years. Back in the day I would only go when a band I really wanted to see was playing. Back in those days I don't think they even HAD any taps LOL. Food was a guy that had a hot dog cart right outside the bar. But hey - it's come a long long way since then. Now I even come to the non-band side where they serve food and craft beers even if I'm NOT planning to see a band. Came with a bunch of coworkers the other day for happy hour. A good time was had by all. They even have one of those Touch Tunes jukeboxes and I took it over for the time we were all there. I had to supress laughter when one of the coworkers claimed "they play pretty good music here." They never figured it out even though every time that someone was wondering out loud what song was playing I just happened to know each time - even if their Shazams couldn't figure it out. The only complaint is the craft beer/food side of the Yucca was a lot hotter than the other side. I'll admit I'm not a big fan of the mall it's in. I usually enter from Mill but now one of the entrances to the mall is blocked off by poles planted into the ground so there is only that one main entrance now. Lots of parking - yeah it's sketchy but further into the night the Yucca is eventually the only business open. Glad this place is still open after Sail Inn, Hollywood Alley, Big Fish Pub, etc have shuttered. Here's to you, Yucca!

Place is geared for ankle-biters but can be really fun if you had 5 or more mixed drinks. Shooting zombies,  racing cars, shooting soldiers, shooting monsters, all that fun arcade stuff. And you also get tickets to win overstuffed animals or just put it back as credit to your Dave and Buster's card. There's a cool bar  up on the 2nd floor that overlooks the mall if you get tired of all the arcade mayhem. Probably worth a couple of hours of solid fun or until a member of your group gets booted from the premises for trying to smoke  in the bathroom. Whichever comes first...

So I don't come here by choice really. Or rather, if I'm coming here for food I either somehow lost track of time and it's now one of the ONLY options in the same zip code or I got talked into it by a friend - after last call somewheres. This place gets really weird after midnight. I've seen drunken older women totally hit on the guy at the cash register - quite entertaining. Oh yeah - the food. There's food. I usually get either the carnitas plate or a carnitas burrito. Pretty good valuewise especially if you get the combo including drink. I'd say the carnitas here is a lot tastier then at the nearby 'berto's. They also have those fifty cent sticker machines that sell wacky stickers. I got one that says Butterface in the shape of a butterfingers bar - good times! Lotsa parking. Open all dang nite...

Came here with a group of friends on a Friday night. We sat down for what seemed like forever before a single waiter/waitress acknowledged our existence. Yeah - so we looked like a sorry bunch of recently released inmates all liquored up and nowhere to go but still! So finally this waiter tries to take our drink orders. We ordered a round and asked for menus. We were then told that they stop serving actual food around 10pm even though the place will serve alcohol till 2am. Really? You have a crapload of people all drinking and getting loaded for the next four hours but you don't want to serve food anymore because  you'd rather give that business to one of your many competitors nearby? What kind of North Korean rocket scientist running this place came up with that idea? It's ok though because a competitor DID make quite a few $$$ off us that night on both drinks AND food.  And next time we'll know not to bother wasting our  time here.

A friend took me here because she loves this place. I mean it's a big packed restaurant in a big packed shopping mall - what's not to like? So of course there was a waiting time of 20 minutes even though there were only 3 of us. They text you twice - first time for confirmation and second when a table becomes available - you get 5/10 minutes to show up. So we hung out in the mall for a bit listening to some band playing in the courtyard. When we finally got our table our host walked us all the way to the back near the restrooms. I had some Sapporo beer straight away and ordered the Sea Bass sushi and Sea Snail sushi. Both were good except the rice portion crumbled the moment I picked it up. I also ordered the Char Siu Ramen. Yes I did. Don't know why but I had high hopes and it sounded really good on the menu. Maybe I didn't see the fine print that said "don't get this - it actually sucks and didn't you come here for the sushi anyway?" When they brought it I started sipping the broth and WTF - I was contemplating throwing it across the room in a fit of rage and then dancing on the table. But no - didn't have THAT many Sapporos yet. The broth tasted really bland like Campbell's Low Sodium Chicken Broth. Were they really using that crap as broth for ramen? Not to mention it's way overpriced to begin with - nevermind what they actually did to it. At least the char siu was pretty good and the noodles were alright. The broth is a big part of it though and even though they usually get it wrong in these parts it's usually still passable. If there is a next time I'll just stick to the sushi. Plenty of parking. Your mileage may vary.

I'm not a big fan of chains so whenever our eclectic foodie group votes to go to Chili's, I always feel  a wave of excitement comparable to that of receiving  an invitation to a Red Hat Society cuddle party. I end up going anyway placing value in the camaraderie of our group higher than an itch to try something new and different and maybe dangerous. The place is easy to spot because it's right on the corner of the little restaurant row part of the Chandler Mall on Chandler Blvd that includes Firebirds, Keg, Majerle's, Elephant Bar, etc. Funny thing is I'm always asking which driveway to turn into for the other ones but Chili's is the easiest since it's the first. Plenty of parking as it's shared  with other restaurants in the area.     So we've been here so many times we have our own waitress  who knows what we're probably ordering and we always get  the same table in the corner on the way to the restrooms.  Not that we're predictable or anything. I usually get the  bacon ranch quesadillas. But I might get the chicken  club quesadilla instead depending on how long it was since the last time we came by. Their burgers are quite decent as well. The great thing about this place is  there's a big enough menu to satisfy everyone in a big  cranky group. I'll give an extra star just based on that.

I'm not crazy about Pho. I've had it. It's ok when it's cold outside but I'm more of  a bun kinda guy. I do love it when Vietnamese  restaurants get creative with the names though.  Pholicious. Unphogettable. There's even a place  in San Diego called Pho King. Somebody was  clueless when that business name was being  registered. Pho is pronounced fuh. But all that  is neither here nor there because I come to this  Vietnamese joint attached to Lee Lee's Supermarket  for their varieties of bun cha. Google "Bun Cha  Obsession" on the internets. Go ahead. I'm not  that bad a case of OCD but I have cravings for it  every so often. This is my favorite place near my  workplace that has the Saigon style bun cha. They  put it all in one bowl and you mix it up with  fish sauce and hot sauce to taste. Different types  of meat depending on which dish you chose but they're  all about the same price. Service is usually decent but sometimes can be slow depending on how crowded  it is. They have a TV that usually blasts some  Vietnamese pop music show. Parking is plentiful as it is in the Lee Lee's mall.

So I was in the neighborhood and needed something to cheap, quick, and easy to eat several nights in a row. Figuring this was a quick and easy take-out I chose this place as a path of least resistance option. However - one night I came a little later and tried to open the door. Nope. Wouldn't budge. Pulled a little harder. Then tried the other door. Then tried the first door again. LOCKED. What the? Holy mother of East Guadalupe Road! I stood stunned for a moment thinking OMGWTF and then I noticed the sign: Open till 10PM. Really? 10 freaking o clock? That's like a Denny's or 7-11 that closes before midnight. Complete sacrilege! The only real reason I go to any 'Bertos is because they are open any time of the day or night. This was the only choice in the immediate neighborhood at that hour since Tott's, Nosh, and Spices were already closed. Well, I could have gone to Zipp's but I'd end up having a few beers as well. But it actually turned out to NOT be a contender after all. No bueno! I prayed to the patron saint of burritos to for guidance to yet another Filiberto's that was actually open - even if only for another hour. Well I actually yelped and found one north of there on McClintock and Guadalupe. That's my Filiberto's of choice from now on. Guaranteed to be open and much more reliable. Also cleaner and with a bigger dining area and even a drive-through option. Why even bother with this place at all?

Been coming here off and on over the years and this last time was the last. Quality of food and service has taken a nosedive. I did notice that it wasn't as crowded as in the past when I came here with a coworker for lunch during prime lunch hours recently and that should have been a tipoff right there that something was amiss. The restaurant was maybe half full if even that but it took forever just to order because the guy taking orders kept leaving the counter to do something else. Couple of folks were in front of us and the line moved at a snail's pace. When it was finally my turn, I ordered the Gyro sandwich and a lamb kabob on the side. Guy at the counter tried to upsell some extra sauces that I thought were way overpriced so I politely declined. Places that nickel and dime on the sauces leave a bad taste in my mouth. We sat down and waited for our food. My gyro sandwich came first. About fifteen minutes later my coworker's food came. Another fifteen minutes went by before my lamb kabob finally came. Perhaps the kitchen's timing and efficiency needs a little work. My disappointment didn't end with the service though - the vegetables in the Mediterranean salad stuffed into the Gyro sandwich tasted really off - like they were far from fresh. To add insult to injury, less than an hour later I had Alexander The Great's Revenge or Cleopatra's Curse or the King Tutskis - whatever you call food poisoning from a Middle Eastern/Mediterranean type place. Yeah - it's my fault for eating it anyway even after the warning signs went off but that is way too many strikes against this place. Never again. Too bad since it's so close to me.

So we came here the other night for old time's sake. I think I've been to this location more times than any other Hooters anywhere else. Probably because we'd meet here for drinks and food before hitting Mill the rest of the night - sometime ages ago. Mill in my opinion isn't that much a worthwhile destination these days but here we were - Hooters. I decided to shake things up a little and get the hottest wings they had - triple dog dare. When I ordered them the waitress's expression changed. I half expected her to bring a priest to administer last rites or something. But when I actually got the wings - they turned out to be pretty darn wimpy. Even Zipp's wings at just regular "hot" level are more intense than these. Talk about overhyped. My friends already know not to help themselves to MY order of wings because I almost always order the hottest possible. They end up sorry they did. LOL. Not even meant as a nasty trick - that's just the way I like it. So I was disappointed that they were overhyped but they still hit the spot. One friend ordered the boneless wings with buffalo sauce but was very disappointed in his order. Management was very professional and courteous and ended up taking it off his bill. Extra star being added for that. Place is right on the southeast corner of Mill and 5th and has been there forever. Parking is where you find it - metered parking on Mill or some nearby parking structure.

Sushi party tonight! Sushi party tonight! Sushi party tonight! Sushi party tonight!  We're gonna have a Sushi party tonight!  Alright!  We're gonna have a Sushi party alright!  Tonight!  We've got nothing better to do Than eat sushi and have a couple of brews  All our friends are gonna hang out here tonight  Alright!  [Apologies to Black Flag]  So I had packed my Yanagiba knife and was ready to be a sushi ninja for the night. All I needed was some fresh fish for the night. I remembered 99 Ranch Market used to always be the place to go for that so that night I made it a destination because it was more or less exactly halfway between home and the party. It's actually called Super L Ranch Market now but it's still pretty much the same store. I just hadn't been there in ages. Pretty good selection of all sorts of Asian variants of alcohol. I ended up grabbing a bunch of the Chinese beer in green buddha shaped bottles. I also grabbed some tuna and hamachi and all the salmon they had. Also some avocado and surimi imitation crab for the californication rolls. I call it that because the first batch we made were pretty amateurish out of shape rolls done by sushi noobs that had some of that buddha beer. Got better as the night wore on. The salmon was the standout I must say. Need to stop by again sometime just for that. Parking is plentiful as it's in the COFCO Chinese Cultural Center. There's even a dining area within the store in you get hungry. Check it out!

Came here with a large group of coworkers and business contacts. Company was footing the bill so no complaints about prices as I wasn't worrying about that. LOL. Nice looking restaurant on the first floor of the Palazzo right as you enter from the walkway connecting to the Venetian.    We started off with a number of appetizers which were all pretty standard I must say. The Tsingtao was flowing so I wasn't too caught up in the quality of the appetizers. I was with a pretty much white bread crowd so we didn't order anything weird like  the Jellyfish or Chicken feet but stuck to safe items  like spring rolls, pot stickers, pork dumplings.   For the main course, I ordered the Singapore style curry rice vermicelli. This was actually pretty good - definitely spicy to my liking and not watered down spicy (safe for the Gwai Lo type) Chinese food. I would come back here. Or rather, if there's another company function like this at Vegas, I would recommend this place. :) A number of my dinner companions ordered clay pot items but none of them came in actual clay pots but instead in some metal containers. Oh well... Forget it,  Jake. It's Vegas not Chinatown!

So I'm a Starbucks fan for the to-go coffee and a  quick bite but this is the place if you actually want to hang out for a while. Much more hangout space than any Starbucks and a much better selection of food. Seems like clientele are mostly Midwestern students but I find this place as a relaxing place to have a meeting when I don't really want to host it at home. They're open till pretty late - ten most nights except Sundays. Service is decent and I have no complaints in all the times I've been here over  the years.

So it's right in this Antiques mall somewhere halfway between Warner and Ray on the east side of Arizona avenue. Plenty of parking space. You can go in the side entrance if you wanna cut to the chase and get straight to the food or you can go through the main entrance if you want to check out all the antiques and GILFs. If you get lost while looking for that perfect piece of junque to put in your living room, it's in the northwest corner of the mall. Best to bring cash since they do take credit cards but above a certain minimum - I forget the whole story. Anyway, I've been here quite a few times and all the dogs I've tried were pretty decent. I usually get a side of cole slaw  in addition to fill out the meal. And they have all  sorts of soda to choose from in their cooler. If you  are there on a Wednesday, that's their Pirogi (or Pierogi - however the heck you spell it) day. The pierogis come with cheese filling and have fried  onions on top and I usually get the sausage to go  with it. It's a special so it comes with a drink.  Can't beat that with a hammer. Oh yeah - if you  aren't a Steelers fan, make sure to ignore all the  memorabilia because it's all over the place. And if you check-in on Yelp, there's some kind of drink special plus it includes a hug from Willy.

So one day I was out and about in this area and it suddenly dawned on me that I've been meaning to check out the bats that supposedly live in this part of town. So I drove north through the Camelback and 40th Street intersection and turned left into a road leading into a business park with various buildings that had huge parking lots. I went as far west as I could and turned into a parking lot for a building that I remember used to house a clinic where there were a bunch of shrinks. I only know this because some time ago  I used to believe that the government was monitoring my email and phone conversations among other things. Luckily, with the help of those shrinks, I realized these were just paranoid delusions and I'm cured now. But back to the parking lot - if you come late enough to watch the bats fly out of their home, most of the businesses in this area should be closed by then so there should be no problem parking here. If any security or parking lot nazi confronts you just tell them you're bat shit insane and came to the clinic to refill your meds. Also tilt your head sideways, drop your voice an octave and spew out whatever Latin phrases you know. Pig Latin works too - those folks ain't NASA brain surgeon linguists.    So anyway I parked and walked northwest alongside the canal until I came to a bridge. It was still a little early so I just chillaxed until the sun went down. Over time, a number of bat enthusiasts showed up including some dude somehow connected with the Arizona Republic. A bunch of people showed up with their kids. Once it got dark, I was able to see bats leave the tunnel under the bridge in small numbers - several at a time. Through the fence I could see them flying so fast eastward from the tunnel along the concrete walls that they looked like tiny tie fighters speeding along the trenches of the Death Star. Unfortunately,  it wasn't a big spectacular wave of bats like you'd see in horror movies or Scooby Doo cartoons so set your expectations accordingly. Your mileage may vary, of course. I've watched the bat exodus from the Congress Street Bridge in Austin as well as at the Carlsbad Caverns and those were much more specatacular events to behold. In this case, you could see small numbers of bats flying around - either coming out of the tunnel or flying over the canal looking for snacks. Didn't stay all that long as the old attention deficit thing started kicking in. I was entertained, though, by one of the moms who brought their children to see the bats telling Mr. AZ Republic to STFU because he was talking too much and possibly scaring the bats from coming out of the tunnel. This bat viewing area is the East side tunnel entrance. There is also one near 24th Street as well which I haven't been to which is the West side tunnel entrance. Not sure when all the bats go on vacation to the annual Guano Producers Convention in the tropical paradise of Nauru but there's a chance you might still be able to view them for a few more weeks.

So if you're not a fan of Karaoke or at least immune to it, you probably won't like this bar much at night. Elite Karaoke hosts karaoke from 9 to closing Tuesday to Friday as well as Sunday. Starz Karaoke hosts it on Saturday. What's the difference between the two karaoke companies other than different DJs? I dunno - slightly different song catalogs maybe. And on the 7th day (Monday) THEY rested. And by THEY I mean the eardrums of the staff that works at Stadium Club. That's the one night the air isn't thick with karaoke and it's a lot more quiet - sorta like what happened overnight when you were no longer allowed to smoke INSIDE bars. You could breathe again. Well, Monday is the quietest night and also the deadest. But if you need a quiet mellow bar to chill and talk and actually listen to your drinking companions, this bar plays that role - straight outta central casting one night a week. This place also has trivia - usually on the days there IS karaoke - just a couple of hours before karaoke. They also have pool, darts, pinball, and a TouchTunes jukebox in the back. Also there is a secret room out back (western side of building) that looks like it's for special occasions or private parties or something like that. They also have a number of TVs scattered around and the bar sells scratchers/lottery tickets and cigarettes. Bathroom is really divey so arrive having gone if you can't handle. Food is alright - I've had the Beef on Weck sandwich and I'd definitely get it again. Also had the wings and their Bratwurst sliders. For a little dive bar I must say they have a pretty rockin' kitchen. Most days the full kitchen closes around 10ish but fried stuff goes on till about closing time. Closing is 2ish - most times they don't take away your drinks till half past 2. Service is pretty good - most of the time it's Ameliana, Katelyn (sp) or the two Ashlis (sp) behind the bar. There's a door to the north that leads outside to the smoker's patio. Not sure what it is about this place that keeps me coming back - maybe the atmosphere and my tricorder always picks up a relatively low douchebag index. Lots of parking since it's in the Alma Ray Plaza/Pollack Chandler Mercado/whatever the heck it's called now mall that also houses 1 Stop Title & Registration Services, Chou's Kitchen, H&R Block Chandler, A-Professional Locks, Dollar Store, Goodwill, Mucho Taco, and Thai Paradise. See you there.

The day after the 100-year-flood we had recently I was watching the feed from a TV news helicopter and saw a parking lot that had turned into a giant swimming pool with a bunch of kids on boogie boards. I wondered where the heck this place was until the camera panned out and I caught a glimpse of the Travelling Monk truck. I didn't have to wait for the camera to pan out and confirm it was near Denny's and Hungry Monk to know where this mall was. This is when I realized the Hungry Monk was a landmark. In the month before this happened, Hungry Monk had become a dining and drinking landmark for me and my friends. Tuesdays and Saturdays are trivia nights and we've attended quite a few of those to play against dozens of other teams with raunchy, silly, risque, and downright funny names. I wouldn't say we've been here enough times to be called regulars but Marcie the bartender knows us and that means we come here often enough. Most of the real regulars hang out at the patio smoking cigs and coffin nails and we've never really ventured out that way. Have seen some bizarre stuff right at closing time at the bar - some guy in his 80's motorboating some woman a few decades younger than he was. Then another time some guy offered his girlfriend to some other guy he was bonding with over drinks. Good times, good times! I've tried most of their food and I usually stick with that massive Hungry Monk Trippel - with locally smoked pulled pork, smoked bacon, and a thick slab of grilled tavern ham and served on thick cut Texas Toast with a side of Freddy G's BBQ sauce. They don't give enough sauce for that though. Also the Monk's Ribs is actually pretty decent for bar food. And their gyros. Funny thing, one of my friends started talking to this guy with tattoos that works at Monk and asked him if he was the bouncer. Nope. Turned out he was the chef. LOL. Place gets pretty packed daily around dinner time but usually clears out before it gets late. These guys also have a TouchTunes jukebox but sometimes they have some crappy radio station turned on so you can't use it. Place closes at midnight most days or at 1 AM weekends. But the closing times are like stop signs in Nogales - mostly just suggestions. I've been there when last call ended up way past the regularly scheduled closing time. Their food is decent but if you're still hungry after they close there's always Denny's next door or Los Favoritos not too far away in the mall.

So we were in Sin City for a few days and one member of our team thought this would be a great place to check out because of the fact it was close to UNLV and the chance that there would be plenty of drunken coeds. We got here on a Monday night an hour or so before midnight and that turned out to not be the case at all - I guess they all had exams to study for. It was just us, the bartenders, and a handful of what looked to be regulars. The bar itself turned out to be so awesome that even our buddy forgot all about the real reason he chose this place to try out. For one, this place has the 3rd largest selection of Whiskeys in the world. The other 2 being in Amsterdam and somewhere in Scotland. They also have a huge walk-in fridge with beer selections from around the world. We didn't even make it past the Belgian shelf and all ended up with Piraats. Last time I saw something cool like that was at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa. We also got a walking tour of the Whiskey Attic. That place was amazing - Whiskey from around the world - hundreds of bottles and they still have more bottles in an adjacent room yet to be sorted before they can be shelved. LOL. Bartender was an amazing guy. He knew all about different types of alcohol and to hear him talk you would think he was some old butler or alcohol industry veteran. The guy is only 23. LOL. One member of our crew wanted to try Absinthe badly for some reason so the bartender put one together - 4 parts water to 1 part absinthe and some sugar - but without all the sugarcube dripping green fairy ritual hocus pocus. Tasted pretty good actually. Definitely worthy of a return visit. It's east of the Strip - on S. Maryland Parkway between Flamingo and Tropicana in a strip mall on the east side of the road just a few blocks north of Tropicana. Lots of parking at night. Not sure about daytime. They have one of those TouchTunes jukeboxes for those of you into that sort of thing. Very cool place.

Does it help to be an alcoholic to work here? Just a rhetorical question. I'm sure it helps if you're a customer. I mean all those choices - I feel like a kid in a candy store. But it wasn't always this way with Total Wine. I remember when they first started popping up all over the place and I got a gift card for Christmas and I wanted to spend it all in one store but their beer selection was completely lacking. Wanted some Belgian beer - Ename and the guy trying to help me out gave me this DUH look and told me they didn't have it and he'd never even heard of it. To be fair, I asked someone at Bevmo the same thing and he HAD heard of it and they were available in their California stores but because of some Arizona regulations they couldn't stock it here locally. So I've been a discount card carrying member of Bevmo since then and one day I walked into this Total Wine and realized they had everything I could ever want right here in this store. No need to wait till the next time I went to California to get certain things. Sometime during the past 6 or 7 years Total Wine did a total turnaround and actually surpassed BevMo! as THE place to go for your alcohol needs.  So I'm not into Dave Letterman or MSN style top ten lists but here are my top 3 reasons to go to this Total Wine instead of the BevMo! on Ray and 54th Street:  1) Selection is much better. Also, if you go online on Total Wine's site, they'll even tell you which aisle and which side of the aisle the item is located on. BevMo's site just tells you how many they have available in that store.  2) Total Wine has it's own parking lot all by itself. BevMo! shares a parking lot with a bunch of other businesses and is pretty close to the Sandbar - I had a few close calls with some folks that I'm sure made the most of happy hour before leaving the parking lot.   3) BevMo! closes at 9PM every day except Sunday - when they close at 7PM. Total Wine closes at 10PM every day except Sunday - when they close at 9PM. So you simply have no choice but to go to Total Wine if you waited too long to stock up.

Came here one Friday night just to check out a new bar. Well, new to us anyway. Actually I take that back - came here for a co-worker's "I just got fired for doing something stupid but let's all have drinks and wish me luck" party a number of years back when it was called something else. This time around I came here after work with some co-workers just to have a few drinks and wind down for the weekend. Came about prime dinner time and place was fairly empty except for a few at the bar. We sat out by the water. Very mellow atmosphere with a pinch of divey. Had the wings and if I remember right Shiner Bock on tap? Wings were decent. We hung outside until one of us got cold so we spent the rest of the time indoors and noticed it got quite crowded inside. By midnight, the place was packed. The music was pretty loud and it mostly came from the internet Jukebox (not TouchTunes but something without an app so you had to pick everything right at the machine where everyone can see you - so I wasn't going to troll the jukebox with requests for nausea-inducing songs by either of the two Wills - William Shatner or William Hung). Our server was very attentive and we all had a pretty good time. Whoever mentioned this was a bar for old men betting on the dogs and horsies and no hot chicks ever probably hasn't been here late on a Friday night. Your mileage may of course vary. Lots of parking as it's in a big mall. Actually FINDING parking - you're on your own LOL. Best bet is sometimes in the parking area by the entrance to Sprouts.

I've always wondered about Lucky Lou's. Usually when going for lunch at Yogi's or Culver's. So I've come here for dinner and drinks. First off, they have Summer Shandy on tap. That's a plus. Second - they know how to make a snakebite. Funny thing though - even though they have condiment holders advertising Blue Moon they don't actually have that on top. Maybe they were thinking - Blue Moon makes great condiment holders even if the beer is shite. Who knows? Didn't bother to find out although I bet it makes a great beertime story. So as far as food goes I've had the 911 wings that threatened to be hot. Pssh. Not a contender. Not even close. Should call them the 411 wings. Call 411 and get a better recipe. One item that is worth getting is the pirogies/pierogies/pirogis - however you spell it. It's Polack comfort food and this place makes it right. Sorry Pittsburgh Willy - this place does it better. Juicy bacon and onions on top and sour cream on the side. Clientele - lotsa older couples come here for grub and drink so it feels like a neighborhood pub. Piped in classic rock played each time I was here - no TouchTunes jukebox or anything like that. Pretty much food and grub only - if you want rawdy raucous craziness eat your meal here first and then go to your other place. Lotsa parking in the mall shared with America's Taco Shop, Yogi's, Culver's and Scottrade. Will definitely be back.

Ok. Parking alert. Not to beat an ethnic stereotype to death but the last time I came here I waited for some woman to navigate into the parking space right next to mine. It took her ten tries I kid you not. Her daughter finally got out of the car and expertly guided her in like those dudes with flags guiding a plane into its proper space. Thank goodness. Other times I feel like I didn't get the memo that there was a take-no-prisoners free-for-all demolition derby going on. But heck with that - even that isn't enough to scare me away from this place. I love it. I usually come here for food first. There's only freaking ten million choices: Taiwan Food Express, Wholly Grill, Hue Gourmet, UnPHOgettable, Deer Garden Signature, Thai Spices, Kong Fu Gyoza, Com Tam Thuan Kieu, Tea, Snow & Coffee, Mekong Palace, Mekong Sandwiches, etc. Most of which I haven't even bothered to try because I'm so hung up on Hue Gourmet. Maybe one day I'll have tried everything on their menu so I can move on. All the food choices alone make this the place to go instead of Lee Lee's or Asiana anymore. Then I mozy on over to Mekong Supermarket. Lots of cool stuff in the meat and seafood department. I'll sometimes get unagi, seaweed salad or surf clam - whatever they have on special. If you like meats not always found in regular supermarkets they have lamb, duck, venison, rabbit, squab, veal, partridge, boar, and quail. Lots of Chinese and Japanese foods. Alcohol section has lots of Asian beers including Beer Lao - that used to be really hard to find in Arizona. The vegetables and fruits area has all sorts of usual Asian grocery store suspects: enoki mushrooms, persian cucumbers, shredded papaya for papaya salads (if you roll your own), and pineapples usually cheaper than regular grocers. There's a whole section of potato chips with all sorts of weird flavors you won't find at Safeway or Fry's - Takoyaki and squid flavors were the favorites of the ones I've tried. Then there's culture clash from which hilarity ensues. Some words have a whole different meaning in another culture. Exhibit A: Filipino steamed rice cake mix in a box labelled PUTO. Might be funny if you're Mexican. Otherwise you'll just hear a noise overhead going woosh. Then there's Exhibit B: that Jamaican treat. A company called Grace puts it out and according to the website, that very product is for the American market. Really? Can you market a soup called "Cock Flavored Soup Mix" with a straight face? What's even weirder is they also have "Chicken Flavored Soup Mix" so do they taste different? Or is that OTHER flavor really what is says it is? I wouldn't know. But maybe even that tastes like chicken. I'll have to take someone else's word for it. If you wanna get some for fun and games at the next white elephant at work it's in aisle 5B where the Hawaiian, Jamaican and Mexican stuff is. I think out of embarrassment they hide that box behind everything else so you may need to dig for it. Your mileage may vary.

So in the NE corner of McClintock and Southern right next to the Cockblister DVD rental there is a Chicago style hot  dog joint that I've been coming to for some time during  the lunch hour. Always ample parking. Ambience is good -  a bunch of tables and the speakers seem to be always blasting indie/alternative tunes. The girl with the dragon tattoo that works the cash register is sweet and very talented - quite a dish. But she's not on the menu. Bummer. Instead, I usually get the Chicago style hot dog with pickles, peppers, tomatoes, onions, mustard and relish. Always a good choice. Otherwise I usually get the juicy Italian Beef. It is very messy and either wear a bib or just don't wear a  white shirt that day - you've been warned. Burgers are also quite tasty and you don't need to worry about the pink slime here. The chili is also very good - either as a topping or on it's own.

Not all bars are the center of the hipster universe. And that's perfectly fine if all you wanna do is have a drink or two and just wind down. Sometimes you just want to do a little chillin'. Like a villain. Or like Ferdinand Magellan. Whatever the case, if that's what you want to do this bar is perfect for it. I've been here a few times and it's never been too crowded. Perfect setting if you want to hang out and have a few with some friends ater work. It's not a bar to "be seen" or to go test what you learned from MSN's "top 10 pickup lines that actually might work" article. It's just a place where you can have a conversation (at least if you sit outside as I always do) without having to shout over the music. The music they play is a good mix of old and new. Sometimes they have people playing music - either some guy with an acoustic or a band - usually not bad but usually nothing to write home about either. Their food menu has a rock and roll theme with names like Nikki Stixx, love-me-tenders, Paul's boutique,  fleetwood mac, eye of the tiger, war pig, culture club, hot for teacher - all names of appetizers, pizzas or sandwiches. They even have twice baked potato skins named - Once Bitten, Twice Baked. Was that referencing Great White? Yikes. Too Soon? The Service I've had here was actually very good. Very attentive  waitstaff. They also have a discount club where you sign up and get discounts - sort of like a loyalty card - which is cool if you come here often. Parking is plentiful as it's in a mall.

Do Swiss Army Knives have a fondue fork that folds away into the knife? They should. While nobody yodelled for us this definitely is the place for lovers of cheese and chocolates. Everybody kept asking what was being  celebrated. For the price of the meal it sure seems like you need a reason to splurge to even walk through the door. We all had a pretty good time regardless. I'm not sure if all locations are like this but you probably  want to make a reservation if you are coming in on a weekend.   So the most popular way of enjoying a meal at The Melting Pot is the four course deal. You get cheese fondue, salad, an Entree and dessert (chocolate fondue). I must say that for a lot of people by the time the third course is done,  that is pretty much it. You can tone down the amount of food to fit the actual amount your group can handle eating. Even if you have four people in your group, you can order the salads for 2 or the entrees for 3. That helps a lot in terms of portion control. When I was there, even the final dessert which  we ordered for one seemed to be a lot.     So you start off with a cheese fondue - you can choose from Spinach Artichoke (Fontina and Butterkase with spinach and artichoke hearts), Fiesta Cheese (aged cheddar with lager beer,  japaleno peppers and salsa), Cheddar Cheese (aged cheddar and Emmenthaler Swiss with lager beer, garlic, and seasonings), Wisconsin Trio Cheese (Fontina and Butterkase with buttermilk bleu cheese, white wine, scallions, and sherry), Traditional Swiss Cheese (Gruyere and Emmenthaler Swiss with white wine,  garlic, nutmeg, lemon and Kirschwasser) and finally the Big Night Out Seasonal Cheese. The waiter comes and sets up a fondue pot and mixes the cheese and all the ingredients which you can then dip breads, fresh vegetables and apples into. This is sort of like an appetizer so there's only one plate for everyone to  get items to dip from.     Then you have a choice of salads for the second course - The Melting Pot House Salad, Spinach Mushroom Salad, Caesar Salad, California Salad, and Big Night Out Salad. These are rather big portions for a salad so if you have a small capacity you might want to share rather than have each person getting their own salad.    Then we get to the entrees. This is the fun part because you do your own cooking. First, you have to choose a cooking style. Pretty much one for the whole group. You can choose from Coq au Vin (Burgundy wine with fresh herbs, spices, and mushrooms), Court Bouillon (vegetable broth with herbs and spices), Bourguignonne (cholestrol-free canola oil), and Mojo (bouillon with fresh garlic and citrus). For the entrees themselves, you have all sorts of  combinations of filet mignon, shrimp, salmon, chicken, sirloin, pork tenderloin, duck, potstickers, ravioli, asparagus, tofu,  edamame, artichoke hearts, Andouille sausage, onion rings, lobster tail, and Portobello mushrooms.    The cooking times were given for each type of food: Poultry, Pork: 2 1/2 minutes Seafood: 2 minutes Beef: 1 1/2 minutes Everything else: 1 minute    I used my iPhone's timer and used both fondue forks at a time to try and get the cooking down to a science. A little silly and fun at the same time. But by the end of it, I was stuffed. Our group decided we'd have only one person's portion of the final course - dessert.     For the final course, chocolate fondue (dessert) you get a  choice of Big Night Out Seasonal Chocolate, The Original (milk chocolate, peanut butter), Yin & Yang (dark and white chocolate), Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream (dark chocolate topped with marshmallow cream flambeed and topped with Oreo cookies), Flaming Turtle (milk chocolate, caramel and candied pecans flambéed), Pure Chocolate (dark, white, or milk), Bananas Foster (Bananas and a  hint of cinnamon swirled in white chocolate), and Chocolate S'mores (milk chocolate with marshmallow cream, flambéed and topped with  bits of graham crackers). We opted for the Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream. They brought a plate of strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice  Krispies Treats, marshmallows, pound cake and brownies to dip in. It was definitely decadent and filled us all to the brim.    Parking is easy to find. It's in the same mall as Zendejas Grill and  Next Coffee. The restaurant itself is right across from Sylvan.

No shirtzsky. No shoezskys. No Schlotzsky's. This location didn't have that sign but I remember that from other times I've been to Schlotzsky's. Always thought that was funny. I do remember when this building used to house some mom n pop breakfast kind of place. Never ate there when it was a breakfast place though. I've been to this Schlotzsky's for lunch, though, over the years whenever I was in this neighborhood for various services - there's a Discount Tire right next door for example. This is the perfect place to bide your time while waiting. This last time I opted for a medium Angus Roast Beef & Cheese sandwich. Pretty much just a regular fast food sammich, right? But the tasty Sourdough buns made me remember why I stopped here and didn't keep going further down the street. Also had the macaroni salad which was alright but otherwise not that memorable. You need the code to get into the bathrooms - I suppose to keep non-customers from loitering and just coming in to use the bathroom. That said, bathrooms were pretty clean. Lots of parking in this mall.

First, a public service announcement...  TONKOTSU = Pork bone. Broth that is used as a ramen soup base. TONKATSU = Pork cutlet (breaded in panko). Something you eat over rice.  Thank you. We now return to our regular opinionated review...     So you just saw Tanpopo or Ramen Girl and wanted to try some ramen from a place that specializes in ramen to see what all the fuss was really about. You come into this place, order a bowl of miso ramen and patiently await your meal. When the girl brings your ramen you close your eyes and imagine yourself in some quaint ramen shop somewhere in Japan - bullet train in the distance,  enka playing from the shop's speakers. You put the ramen broth to your lips and....  PPPPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!  almost spit it all back into the bowl. Instantly you're back in Tempe - light rail in the distance, alternative rock blasting from the speakers. The broth has not a molecule of miso flavor that your tongue can detect. Hell, Maruchan and Top Ramen have more flavor in their "flavor packets" than this sorry excuse for a broth.    Anyway, that's sorta what happened to me more or less. Came in  with rather high expectations and had them shattered the moment I tasted the broth. Umm... did I order the Shoyu Ramen by accident I wondered? If so, MISO SILLY! If I did, though, there should be  a stronger shoyu flavor. The noodles themselves tasted ok. There  were some slices of char siu and they were passable - meaning they  actually had a flavor that resembles char siu. But still, this   place wouldn't even cut it as a hospital cafe in a bad part of Tokyo. Reading some of the other reviews, however, I guess it can cut it  in a strip mall in Tempe on the south side of East University Drive.       I'd actually been here once before a while back and don't even remember what I ordered - it was that good. So I came back a second time just to make sure.  Fool Me Once, Shame On You. Fool Me Twice, MISO STUPID!    So I'm still hoping for a real ramen place to open up in the valley someday. Yeah, sure, some Japanese restaurants have ramen on their menu.  I mean an actual ramen shop that just serves ramen. Maybe yakisoba and  udon as well but primarily ramen. One can dream, right?

I came here once back when it was called something like 3 margaritas. Food was meh and we were one of the only groups of customers there. I guess that place going out of business wasn't too hard to imagine. Fast forward to 2014. This place is ALWAYS packed. We try to get here before 11:30 on regular days so we won't be on the waiting list. A few times we even turned around and went somewhere else because the wait was too long. Oh and Fridays? Fugedaboutit!!! Still, this is on the lunch rotation with a number of my coworkers. We always get the lunch specials. I get the lasagna (Monday special) usually no matter what day of the week it is. You get salad and bread but go easy or you won't finish your main course. Well, that's the way it is for me usually. Your mileage may vary according to how many seats you take up on a plane. I've tried a bunch of other stuff but lasagna has always been my favorite. But don't worry, tough guy, they got pasta - they got all that shit! They also have those loyalty cards which are good to take advantage of if you come here a lot because you fill it up and get a free lunch on the next visit. Can't argue with that. This is my favorite Eyetalian joint in the area. We've been to Marcello's right down the friggin' street but we all agreed this place was a better bang for the buck and had much better service. Parking is easy - it's in a mall - it's in a mall with Harbor Freight Tools and Dunkin Donuts. Check it out.

Came here to take a walk late one Saturday afternoon. Parked by the artillery at the war memorial and walked counter clockwise around the lake. No sooner had we started walking when we heard a massive commotion - some guy yelling and next thing we see this guy swimming in the reclaimed water. Yech! Really, dude? Turned out he was chasing after his dog that decided to jump into the water and swim across the lake. The dog made it to the other side of the lake and the dog owner got back out of the water and ran to the other side to meet the dog as it exited the lake. Dog: 1, Dog owner: 0. Some guy who lost his frisbee while playing frisbee golf tried to ask mr. dog owner if he could fetch his frisbee for him now that he was already wet and tainted with reclaimed water as he ran past us after his dog. Mr. dog owner was definitely unimpressed and ignored the guy. I found all this very entertaining of course. The fountain, which we came to see, didn't go off at 6:00ish like it was supposed to. After we walked around the park and hung out a bit it did go off around 7ish. Turns out if the winds are more than 10mph the fountain doesn't turn on. Since the winds sorta died down an hour later we got to see it finally. Looks pretty cool. But don't take my word for it - see for yourself. Lots of parking. If you need food and refreshments there are a lot of restaurants by the side of the lake where the playground and splash park is.

Popsicle popsicle popsicle I want to eat my popsicle popsicle popsicle I want to eat my popsicle I want to eat my pop I want to eat my popsicle I want to eat it where I like  It's weird. Never been that big into popsicles. Still, when the Michoacan paleta cart pusher happened to be passing by wherever I was I'd usually stop and get one. Sometimes the flavors were good, sometimes just ok. But I'm addicted to Paletas from this place. I've liked everything I tried so far at Paletas Betty. I know I'll keep coming back just to try the stuff I haven't yet. And even after that I'll come back for the ones I liked the most. You can pay with credit card because they're running Square or something like it. Always plenty of parking when I come by - Boston Street west of Arizona. The Paletas all come with a bitemark. LOL. Whenever I've treated friends to these paletas that's the first thing they notice. Another cool thing is the plastic wrapping around the paleta has a peelable sticker on it. I've stuck em all over the place. There's a contest on their website where you need to stick the Paletas Betty sticker in some exotic part of the world and you can win a free Paleta. I'll stick it on a Kim Il Sung statue on my next North Korean vacation.

So this is a good place to come for "the morning after"... for the weekend resurrection breakfast. It's in the neighborhood so for me it starts with a walk. Weekend breakfasts may require a bit of a wait if you come at primetime - as others usually have the same idea (imagine that). But it's a nice alternative to Denny's - more neighborhood feel and clientele a notch classier. I get the coffee - just a regular cuppa joe, nothing fancy. But that's what's needed to start the resurrection process. Friend I usually come with is usually in the same condition. Last time we came he spilled his orange juice all over the table. Tsk tsk. "Always start with the coffee," I told him. The staff was quick to clean things up so we were grateful for that. So anyway I've had omelettes before and this time I had the Eggs Benedict. It definitely hit the spot for me. I actually prefer the Eggs Benedict because you get less overall starch if you substitute something else for the hash browns. That way the bloated/stuffed/full feeling doesn't linger the rest of the afternoon. Sometimes service takes a while - especially when the place is crowded so bring your patience with you or come when you're not in a hurry to get somewhere else after your meal. Place is in the mall with Albertson's, Nosh, Tott's, Starbucks, and Spices. It's right next door to Spices. It's in the Albertson's mall Northwest corner of Ray and McClintock so plenty of parking. Open for breakfast and lunch.

Hue, the former imperial capital of the Nguyen Dynasty between 1802 and 1945, has it's own regional cuisine that sets it apart from other regional cuisines in Vietnam and we're lucky to have a place that serves such cuisine right in our own Mekong Plaza in Mesa. I've been coming here at least every other weekend to try out a different dish. So far my favorite items are Banh Khot, Bun Mang Vit, Mi Quang, and Bun Bo Hue. They're open every day except Wednesday. Service is decent - the only complaint I have is all the flies in the food court you have to keep swatting away from your food. Prices are very cheap and you definitely get lots of value for your buck spent here. Their menu is kinda splattered all over the walls and is a little hard to follow so I'm pasting it in here in true OCD fashion (minus the diacritic marks which won't get posted in Yelp until Vietnamese becomes one of the languages supported.)   101) Banh Beo - [BUN BAIL] - rice coin with shrimp flakes, green onion topping, and crunchy pork skin 102) Banh Nam - [BUN NUM] rice roll with shrimp flake in banana leaf 103) Banh Loc La - [BUN LOCK LAH] - Clear Dumpling filled with Shrimp and Pork in Banana Leaf 104) Banh Loc Tran (Party Tray Only) - [BUN LOCK TRONG] - Clear Dumpling filled with Shrimp and Pork, coated with green onion oil 105) Banh Gio - [BUN JOE] - pyramid shaped rice dough dumpling with pork, Jicama, wood ear mushrooms, and wrapped in banana leaf 106) Banh Bao Nhan Thit Trung - [BUN BOW NYANG TICK CHOONG] - steamed bun filled with pork and egg 107) Banh Bao Nhan Xa Xiu (Special Order Only) - [BUN BOW NYANG SA SIU] - steam bun filled with BBQ pork 108) Banh Ba Te So (Weekend Only) - [BUN PAH TAY SHOW] - Pork Paté Choud 109) Cha Gio Tom - [CHAW JOE TOME] - Shrimp Egg Roll 110) Banh Khot - [BUN CAULK] - crispy mini pancakes with shrimp topping served with veggies and dipping sauce 111) Banh Mi Thit Nuong - [BUN MEE TICK NOONG] - mini French bread filled with pepper pork and mint 112) Banh Mi Thit Nguoi - [BUN MEE TICK NOOEE] - mini French bread filled with cold cut and shredded pickle 201) Bun Bo Hue - [BOON BAW HWAY] - Hue style beef and pork noodle soup, spicy level [0-5] 202) Banh Canh Cua - [BUN KUN KOO AH] - hand cut tapioca flour noodle soup with real crab meat and shrimp 203) Bun Rieu Cua - [BOON REW KOO AH] - crab cake, spare rib, meat loaf, tomato noodle soup served with veggies 204) Bun Mang Vit - [BOON MUNG VEET] - Duck Noodle Soup with bamboo and served with duck slices on a bed of sweet and sour cabbage 205) Bun Cha Ca - [BUN CHAW KA] - steamed and fried fish cakes over noodle soup served with veggies 206) Mi Quang - [MEE KWANG] - Quang Nam style noodle with shrimp, pork, quail egg and veggies 207) Bun Thit Nuong (egg roll can be added) - [BOON TICK NOONG] - grilled pork over rice vermicelli, served with veggies and Vietnamese pickle 208) Com Hen - [KOM HEN] - baby clam meat over rice with vegetables and clam juice 301) Cha The - [CHAW TEH] - steamed pork stick wrapped in banana leaf 302) Cha Hue Don - [CHAW HWAY DON] - Hue style meatloaf 303) Cha Oc - [CHAW OAK] - Escargot mixed in pork stick 304) Cha Tom (Call In Advance) - [CHAW TOME] - shrimp cake, steamed 305) Cha Que (Call In Advance) - [CHAW KWAY] - charbroiled cinnamon flavor pork slab 306) Nem Nuong (Call In Advance) - [NUM NOONG] - broiled star anise flavored pork meat ball 307) Tre Hue - [CHE HWAY] - pickled head cheese wrapped in banana leaf 308) Tom Chua - [TOME CHOO AH] - pickled shrimp with shredded papaya  [ Drinks]  01) Ca Phe Sua Da/Nong - [KA FEY SOOH DA/NOWNG] - Coffee Iced/Hot 02) Nuoc Da Lanh - [NYOO DUH LUN] - Iced Water (free if you eat here) 03) Nuoc Tra Da - [NYOO CHA DUH] - Iced Tea 04) Nuoc Tra Nong - [NYOO CHA NOWNG] - Hot Tea 05) Pepsi, Coca Cola, Diet Coke, Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, Sprite, 7 Up, Shasta 06) Nuoc Suoi Chai - [NYOO SOY CHAI] - bottled water 07) Che Dau Do Bot Ban, Nuoc Cot Dua, Dap Da - [YEH DOW DOH BO BUN, NYOO KOH ZOO UH, DUP DUH] - red bean, tapioca, coconut milk, crushed ice 08) Nuoc Da Chanh Tuoi Vat - [NYOO DUH CHAN TOOEE VUT] - Freshly Squeezed Limenade

We all need a pub to relax and wind down after work and be able to shoot the shit about whatever the hell we want - whether it's which co-worker is about to overdose on the boss's dingleberry dust or who's dipping the pen in the company ink. And this is a great place for it. Food is pretty decent and definitely several tiers above standard bar food. They always have different beer to choose from than the week before and once in a while there are promotions. Once I got a free pint glass with a brewery logo on it and a bunch of stickers of various beer brands which were all NSABS (not safe as bumper stickers). I always feel at home here - service is always good and people are cool. That is, the clientele and people working there are cool. Once, I must confess, I brought a friend who should have been left back in his mom's basement in hindsight. Yeah. You know. We all have that friend. The one you can't take anywhere. And it cracks me up that on the list of beers for the week, Flanny's always has the one choice with the least alcohol content from the Anheuser-Busch brewery - the beer of kings. And that is what said friend pre-loads on before we go anywhere so that the night is "cheaper". Well this time around he decided to go for the higher alcohol percent - 10 percent. Whoa. Shoulda stopped him. Next thing you know he's seeing Dungeons AND Dragons as well as black helicopters and false flag terrorists in every pot under everyone's bed. Then when we were ready to leave for the night he lost his mind over the fact that the waiter gave us pink pens to sign our credit card receipts. He decided that the fact that the pens were PINK was some sort of coded message from the waiter that he suspected us all of being part of the LGBTOMGWTFRU community. I had to convince him that they were pink not because the waiter thought we were fifty shades of gay (not that there would be anything WRONG with that of course) but rather maybe those were the ONLY freaking pens they had - it's not like they had a box of 64 different colors (like we had crayons in kindergarten) and they specifically picked out pink. I told him if he were that insecure about his masculinity he should just buy a muscle car or monster truck and that would well make up for perceived lack of length, girth, radius, circumference, or whatever other dimension was getting him down. So yeah. This place is not really for EVERYONE. Take those folks who won't drink anything they can't pronounce to the Sand Bar instead.

Came here with a friend one weekend just for a stroll. Didn't know there was such a nice big park close to me. It has a lake, a number of places to have a nice picnic, a train that goes around part of the park for the kiddies, playgrounds, tennis courts, a splash pad. Only thing that I found unpleasant was the smell of the lake and that there were dead fish floating. Eeeww. Will probably be back in the cooler months. Park is kinda hidden in the block between Rural and McClintock and between Ray and Chandler. Plenty of parking all around the park.

Give not that which is holy unto the dogs,  neither cast ye your pearls before swine,  lest they trample them under their feet,  and turn again and rend you.  If you come here for the buffet seriously WTF? Why are you still alive? There's a Panda Express just down the street on the other side of the 101. This place is for some seriously awesome Chinese food. Reject the gwai-lo menu and insist on the menu that is mostly Chinese characters but also has descriptions in English. Thanks to the reviews of fellow yelpers I had the deep-fried taro duck. Wow! This dish is definitely a must and I order it all the time now. I've had the Yui Shan Eggplant and Mabo Tofu as well. I really like this restaurant's take on both dishes. Last time that I came here, I ate in with a bunch of friends. They offered a special - which was roast duck. Haven't had anything here that was not delicious. While dining, we saw them take out a few fish from the huge tank they have right in the middle of the restaurant. Then all of a sudden you would hear BAM! BAM! BAM! LOL. Can't argue the fish isn't fresh. Next time I'll have to actually order some fish dish. This place is like a well kept secret - I've driven by so many times to go to Fry's but somehow it never occurred to me to check this place out. Glad I finally did. Hong Kong Asian Diner (香港楼) is definitely a keeper! Located in the mall with Fry's on the NW corner of Ray and Rural. Plentiful parking.

Ok - so this fine burger joint is located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo. I came here just for some sanity and to eat my first meal of the day after arriving from the airport and checking in. This place has free wi-fi. A very cool feature. Not just your ordinary burger place, you have all sorts of interesting burger choices. Once I had some fish (I think it was ahi) and this last time I had the eggplant. Yeah. It's just me. I always gotta try the stuff that's "different." So this place also has all sorts of beer as well. You can't get that at McDonald's - so that's why I was "lovin' it" over here. Most of the waitresses here were eye candy quality so that was another plus. How many burger places offer Delerium Tremens? That's what I thought. Yeah - it all ain't cheap.  10 bucks for a burger. But it's Vegas.

They say X amount of folks can keep a secret if X-1 of them are dead. No. Not an algebra problem but you know how it goes with secrets - once too many people know it sure ain't a secret. Once you mention a place like this on a TV show that's just as good as advertising on billboards on every highway leading to Vegas. So one night when I was free to roam on my own for dinner I made a beeline for this place. I didn't see the TV show but a friend did and he's a pizza connoisseur and recommended this place. Third floor of the Cosmopolitan - there's no sign but I think most people would be curious to see where this hallway leads to anyway so I wouldn't call it "hidden". 3000 plus reviews also suggests you'd have to amass a rather high body count before this place ever becomes a "secret" again. When I got to the end of the hallway there was a line and all available spots to hang out and eat your pizza were occupied. I got a Goose IPA and one slice with ricotta and meatball and one sausage pizza slice. Priced just as any other place in Vegas but I've had pizza at food courts in various hotels in Vegas and the pizza was better than any of those. Worth the trip however long the walk on the strip to get here is. Not sure what the place is really called - my bill just had the generic "pizzeria" name on it. As always, your mileage may vary. Open till 4AM and some nights even till 5.

Eh cuz, I like make da kine public service announcement first for all da buggahs stay writin' reviews for anykine Hawaiian place. No such thing as Kahlua pig. We no put da kine coffee liqueur and shit on da pig, bra. Also, no moa Kailua Pig either, bra. You buy pig or pork in Kailua and bring em' back to Honolulu and you goin' be takin' pig/pork on da kine, Pali Highway. First thing goin' happen is yo' car goin' stall right on da highway, bra. Next da night marchers goin' carjack your car. Then Madam pele and da limu lady - two of da baddest tittas on da island goin' take you to Morgan's corner and bang yo' head on the 13 steps, bra. By da time they done with you, you goin' forget about evah callin' it Kailua pig. It's Kalua, bra. Ok bruddah. Enough of the public service announcements. Dis place stay in one mall next to one Barnes and Nobles. I went come here plenty times. One pake family stay run this place and they do one pretty good job of making island kine plate lunches. Fo' me L&L in North Phoenix is still da best but when I no like drive too far this stay second best. I usually get one of da combo meals, bra - that's the way to go. This blala gives dis place the big shaka sign. Bettah than pig. Bettah than poi. I no shit you. Best Hawaiian food this part of town, bra. One thing - da guy who take da order, bra, he never say nothing. I think he stay da kine - android from Kikaida. I no say nothing bumbai he turn into da kine - red mask and blue suit and chase me out of da store with one spear shouting "git 'em! git 'em!"

So there's this karaoke rent-a-room and sing with friends type place that's been around forever - everywhere in the world it seems but just recently started up here. Or at least as far as I'm concerned - I'm always late to such parties. There's this place called August Karaoke Box (八月恋歌) in Tempe on the south side of University between McClintock and Rural - more specifically in the mall at University @ Dorsey that has businesses like Republic Ramen. You basically pass Republic Ramen and go south into the parking lot and it's in the same building on the east side of the building. There's also a rock climbing place to the south so it can be busy and the parking situation can vary.   So... I've been here a few times with friends and there are things I like about it and things that I am not particularly pleased with. I'll break it down for y'all...  Pros:  1) During the weekdays of Monday through Thursday before 8 pm you pay 15 bucks an hour. That works out pretty cheap if you come with friends. It's usually not crowded in the afternoons at all.   2) You get a private room so nobody sees you singing except for your friends if you're the shy type and are mortified about the idea of singing in front of people. This also allows you to try out songs you normally wouldn't dare without any embarassment when the song becomes a trainwreck.   3) These rooms allow you to have a private party for as long as you like and are willing to pay for.   Cons:  1) Catalog - I understand that the reason this KTV place even exists is the Chinese speaking clientele - which is why I wasn't too surprised when the receipt I got after paying was almost all in Chinese characters. That said they could use a much bigger English language artist catalog. It's funny that the Rod Stewart and Bee Gees song catalogs are much bigger than the Beatles catalog and there isn't any Rolling Stones at all that I could find. Nor could I find any Eagles. Or Led Zeppelin. Been here a few times and I can see the novelty fading pretty quickly after going through all the available songs that I like/know. It might be my lack of Karaoke GUI navigation skills but I searched by artist and looked at all the offerings for each particular artist. What's weird is you can type in songs by name and they sometimes come up even if the artist isn't listed in the artists section. Oh well.   2) The way the lyrics show up on the screen are usually two lines at a time. During faster paced songs the transitioning of the lyrics to the next pair of lyrics can sometimes be slow enough that you can be caught waiting/wondering what the rest of the lyrics are (if you don't know the song too well). Most karaoke bar type setups have a full screen of lyrics at a time to avoid that.   3) The backing tracks/video. So some of the songs have the actual music video or live video of the artists playing their songs. Some of them have some weird Chinese videos of women walking through the street but having nothing to do at all with the song itself. Awkward. But some of the audio tracks sound like MIDI - like you're listening to an old school arcade game rendition of that song. Fortunately not all songs are like that.  If you're a karaoke fan this might appeal to you to try at least once anyway. As always, your mileage may vary.

So I was moving and my belongings needed a place to stay and I wanted to do this without imposing on friends and relatives and acquaintances so that I wouldn't be forever in their debt or obliged to show up when THEY moved. Yeah. I'm THAT guy. So that meant slowly storing my stuff over time in a place close to where I was moving. This exact location seemed to be the perfect spot. Staff were very nice and friendly although the only time I ever dealt with them was at the very beginning and at the very end. The office hours are 9:30 to 5 or 6 depending on weekday or weekend but the actual access hours are 6 am to 9 pm. I would often come early morning or early evening after work and I'd be the only soul around. Nice and quiet or kinda creepy depending on whether you're a glass half full or empty kinda person. I kinda liked it. The only sounds I'd hear in the evening would be from the rowdy folks at the Tilted Kilt next door over the wall. Stuff was pretty secure - who really wants somebody's old Playboys and bowling trophies anyway? Not that that's what *I* was storing. Obviously I'm more of a Penthouse kinda guy. Anyway, as long as you don't store anything perishable everything should be fine. I had the cheapest type of storage and there was no air conditioning but dust can accumulate over time so best to keep things covered depending on how long you're keeping stuff there. You get an access code and I swear I had to look at my cheat sheet each time. By the time I memorized it, I had already finished using their services. The only drawback to this location is that depending on the time of day and day of the week you go there can be non-stop traffic on Warner in both directions. Sometimes rather than attempt a left turn I just ended up doing a right turn and then quickly doing a U the moment I had clearance because rush hour traffic was too damn thick.

I've had everything on the menu except the veggie burgers. The chicken club is my absolute fave. This place has got it down - simple menu - burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Do a few things really well rather than a lot of things just so-so. I can dig it. You can also get a salad instead of fries so  that's a big plus when you want to eat a bit healthier than you can at a typical burger joint. Seating is  both inside and outside but be warned that sometimes you may encounter panhandlers if you sit outside.  Also, parking can suck since this location gets rather crowded during lunchtime and right next door is a Starbucks that can also get crowded. I usually park a bit east of the area so I can get out quicker. Beats your average fast food burger joint with a baseball bat out of the ballpark.

Located in an old strip mall at the Southeast  corner of 51st avenue and Olive in the location that used to house Restaurant 28 - I miss that place because they had the best catfish in town. Not just the catfish but the sauce that went over it. But this is not about them. It's about the new restaurant in it's place... So this place isn't much  - it isn't really some place you come for ambience  even though there are a few tables. They call it Food  To Go for a reason. Went there recently and it was hot  outside and they don't seem to worry about air conditioning because it was rather hot in the dining/waiting area. But that didn't matter. I was there to sample some Jamaican food. What I DIDN'T know was that I was about to discover Belizean food as well. Well, just one item - the Belizean tamale. So what? Just a tamale. Haven't you ever had a tamale before? Nope. NOT the same thing. The Mexican style tamales I'm used to are smaller and I can probably eat 5 or 6 of them in one sitting. This thing was like holey moley! It was HUGE! The size of a burrito at least. Heck this is an entire meal in itself. The regular maize meal with recado roja - a quite spicy and tasty paste. Inside of it they put a whole chicken drumstick. That's the Belizean way. Yup. Good? Heck yeah. Oh yeah. I also like their curried goat. They sell a huge dinner plate for about 9 bucks. The potato salad that came with the plate was delicious. So were the plantains and rice that came with it. They have a little selection of Jamaican grocery items at one side of the store that you can browse while waiting for your meal to be made. Lots of products by Grace - including the unfortunately named cock-flavoured soup. Why couldn't they just call it Chicken? But no matter. I bought a bunch of them for the next White Elephant at my workplace. Makes a great gag gift (no pun intended). Definitely will be back. Only gripe about this place is their hours are more suited for a bank than a  restaurant. You have to make it by 6 in order to get one of their dinner takeout plates.

Paletas Betty. No. Not a stripper name. A place where you can get awesome popsicles - sorta like what the guy pushing the popsicle cart sells except those are pretty standard one-dimensional flavors - coconut, strawberry, lemon, etc. Paletas Betty cranks it up a notch and has some pretty crafty awesome flavors. I went to this location right off of Mill one Sunday afternoon when it was hot as the devil's sphincter and a popsicle sounded like the best freaking thing in the world at the moment. I walked in there and the girl working there asked what I wanted. Quick scan of the menu. Cucumbers and Mint. In a popsicle. Ok. SOLD TO THE MAN GOING CRAZY FROM THE HEAT!!!! It was actually delicious. Chunks of cucumber in the popsicle as well. I know it sounds metrosexual as hell but it was really refreshing and I always gotta try the weird stuff. I'll be back to one of their locations to try their other flavors. Yeah - pricey for a popsicle but then again I hardly ever eat popsicles so I don't care. It was sunday so all metered spaces were free. Parking usually sucks any other day of the week. They have Square so don't worry if you don't have cash.

Located in a strip mall at the southwest corner of Ray and Rural is Szechwan Garden - a place I have gotten take out from a number of times. Came here today with some friends and I was thinking perhaps I should have warned them. We got seated right away and were handed menus. These were the regular menus and they had stuff like pig intestines, frog, kidneys, lungs. Also on the wall were specials written out in chinese characters. There were probably 40 people in there for late lunch/early dinner and we were the only table speaking to our servers in English. I was expecting one of my friends to say something along the lines of: "Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Panda Express/Pei Wei/PF Chang's anymore." But no - everybody was totally into it. We got the Crispy Sesame Duck - fried and salted with juicy crispy skin. That one was a winner. We also got Mapo Tofu - always a winner with me since I love the soft tofu in black bean sauce and Szechwan spices and oil. We also got the Shredded Pork In Hot Garlic Onion - which was also delicious. Service was great. We had an unruly kid in our midst but the servers were VERY patient with him. Once the food came he calmed down and dug into it. Needless to say we all left full and happy. My goto place for Szechwan has been both Szechwan Garden and Szechwan Palace ever since Miu's closed. This one is the closest to where I live so I know I will be back again. It's in a strip mall in a corner by itself so there's always lots of parking. Check it out.

So I used to come here back in the days of this place's previous incarnations - both Luna Pizza and Dos Amigos Fresh Mex Grill. Both of those places served alcohol. This place is a fast food chain so none of that here. Too bad. I've eaten here a couple of times and did take out a number of times. I've actually never seen this place crowded. Then again, I don't drop in at primetime. Hands down the best thing here IMHO is their Diablo Shrimp Burrito. They make it with their signature Diablo Sauce and that actually has some kick to it. Usually when some place claims a dish is "spicy" I take it with a grain of salt - or actually with a couple of spoonfuls of added hot sauce. The Diablo Shrimp burrito, however, actually IS spicy and not just "gringo spicy." So beware in case you're one of those people that thinks those spicy Taco Bell packets are actually spicy.

I went here for the Grand Opening and enjoyed my dining experience then. Since then, however, it seems to have fallen in quality a few notches. One thing  about this place is that it's huge - you could hold a Star Trek convention here. Put a little random food coloring on everything and call it Klingon cuisine. But I wasn't feeling it the last time I went. Both my dining companion and I felt that the drinks were a bit funny-tasting for starters. Flat. Blech.    They have ribeye steaks you can get cooked for you on the grill. That's a plus. A lot of the same things that Pacific Seafood Buffet has - escargot, frog legs, sushi. I didn't dare touch the sushi though - the coloring looked very OFF. It looked like somebody made pieces of fish out of playdoh or something. Something about the colors looked very wrong. When I see something like that, my food poisoning radar goes off and I won't go near it. Perhaps they just  colored some inferior fish species and got the coloring  wrong - I dunno. It just didn't look right.    I enjoyed the regular Chinese dishes - beef brocolli, egg rolls, chow mein, pizza (didn't Marco Polo bring that to China?), pot stickers, etc.   For dessert I usually get the green tea ice cream. This last time I decided to try the cheesecake. It was still  frozen! WTF! Why even bring it out if the damn thing is still solid frozen!! At least let it thaw a bit before bringing it out for people to dig into! After this last experience I'm  not sure if I would go back to this place...

TOP TEN REASONS FOR YOU ***NOT*** TO SEE THIS SHOW. (based on reading other reviews)  1. The show doesn't have any celebrities. NOPE! No Lady Gaga, no Justin Timberlake, no has-been from a decade or two ago from some short-lived TV show or anything like that. If you want that, go see some show on the strip with a celebrity you know. Carlos Santana does a show at the Mandalay Bay. Penn & Teller do a show at the Rio. I highly recommend both of those but your mileage may vary.   2. This is NOT a big fancy production with thousands of extras and big flashy explosions or a chorus of thousands singing and giant immaculate stage settings and props. David Hasselhoff will NOT be swinging from the ceiling on a wire in a cameo as a Candarian demon with fire shooting out from both ends. If you want that, there are tons of big shows elsewhere on the strip. Go see one of those instead. Maybe even one of those given for free you can watch from the sidewalk in front of a major casino on the strip once every hour. This is a pretty low-budget production in comparison.  3. There is profanity. Dirty jokes. Lots of dialogue (both scripted and ad-libbed) that is not in good taste. Sophomoric 3rd grade humor by the bucketload. If you can't handle this, stay in your hotel room and watch the tube or go see some OTHER show.   4. This is definitely NOT high art. If you want that there are plenty of other shows to make you go ooh and ahh and soil your panties/briefs/undies over how artistic and beautiful the production and performance is. This is NOT such a show. Go watch an opera or see a Shakespeare play instead. This is a cheesy musical based on some cheesy horror flicks about a bunch of college kids who went to a cabin in the woods to get laid and end up playing a cassette of a professor reading key excerpts from the Necronomicon that happen to summon deadly demons. The demons possess everyone but the main character and he heroically kills them all. That's the plot in a nutshell. Sound stupid? Save your money and see something else.  5. You did NOT see any of the movies. Wait a minute. If you haven't seen the movies what in the Rumpelstiltskin's mother diddling heck are you doing watching this in the first place? Why would you even be curious to see this? Why would you even give two units of fecal matter enough to pay admission? See the movies first. I don't care if you download them off Pirate's Bay or steal them from your local library or borrow them from your basement dwelling friend. See the movies first. Otherwise every single reference and all of the action on stage will be close to 100 percent lost on you.   6. If you can't handle watching a musical where every cast member is not a professional singer/musician and may hit a sour note once in a while, this is not for you. If you go to see orchestras while thumbing through the score and snorting whenever you catch a musician missing one of them hemi-demi-semi-quavers then this isn't for you either. Plenty of other shows on the strip. I suggest either strong medication or a long walk off a short pier as other possible alternatives.   7. The show doesn't have well-known professional actors. This was a community theater type production that was brought to the Strip AFTER success at that level for over a year. If you can't deal with that, see some other show or stay at home or in your hotel and watch something on PBS.  8. Even if you HAVE seen the movies, this musical STILL may not be just your cup of tea. In fact I will go out on a Candarian demon's limb and assume the majority of fans of the movies aren't really into musicals PERIOD for the most part. That said, there's this thing called the internet some guy named Al Gore supposedly invented. Also there's this thing called youtube. Search. Evil Dead: The Musical. Many videos. This has already run very successfully in many different cities. Watch a few. You'll find out quick if it's something you really want to see or not. The musical has been performed since 2003 and is NOT the creation of this performance group in Las Vegas. Just saying. There will be no pop songs that you know and love but instead various musical numbers such as "Look Who's Evil Now", "What The Fuck Was That?", "Do The Necronomicon", "Blew That Bitch Away", and my favorite doo wop type number: "All The Men In My Life Keep Getting Killed By Candarian Demons".  9. There is blood. It is squirted on people in the "SPLATTER ZONE". If you can't stomach this, stay home and watch the Disney or Discovery channels. And yes, the "dispensing mechanisms" for this splatter zone are very primitive. But then again, this is not a GWAR concert - no giant "blood cannons" squirting fake blood and guts into the first 8 rows of the crowd.   10. Do not see this show if you are easily offended and have any Candarian heritage in your family tree. That goes without saying.   It's in Planet Hollywood along the Miracle Mile. Lighten up and have fun. I did. Your mileage may vary.

This is the newest, cleanest, and least crowded of all the fast food/pit stop places in Gila Bend. It's the first thing you pass if you come from the Yuma direction and the last thing you pass if you come from Phoenix. The McDonald's has always been the old standby but now there's a less crowded alternative. It is actually at the western end of the big parking lot that has McDonald's and a whole lot of huge truck parking spaces. Service was decent and food was alright. Bathroom was clean. I usually just blow through Gila Bend but if I need to stop here, this is the place.

So came here one Friday evening and found out they had "the hottest wings in Arizona" according to their menu. That was what they said about their "donkey hot" wings. Not sure what the waitress was referring to when she said that the statement referred to the "competition version" of the sauce. Whatever the case I tried the wings - they went down ok but I felt the burn in my stomach as it churned hours later. I wanna say it's at the level of Teakwoods but I had lunch at an Asian place earlier that already gave me a kick in the gut (so to speak) so maybe it was the wrong night to do a challenge like that anyway. Came again for their Monday Night Karaoke. I saw the sign advertising it in the bar on Friday and it sounded like a blast. Not many places around here do an actual Karaoke show on Monday and this one was lots of fun - an energetic crowd clapping along. Had the Monday Night special which was the French Dip sandwich - it was good. Some folks I was with swear by the garlic fries - will have to investigate in the future. They have both Summer Shandy and Blue Moon on tap so they have that going for them. Place also has Off Track Betting, darts, a bunch of pool tables, and poker. On the weekends they sometimes have live bands and it becomes a hip hop club after 9pm. A little something for everyone. A little divey but that's part of the charm. Will definitely return. Lots of parking as it shares the retro 70's Vegas cheesy neon light looking Palm Court Centre with a number of other businesses like Hoosier Cafe, International Minute Press, Pho VIetnam, Hookah Lounge, Farmer's Insurance, Jimmy Nails Spa, Drastic Changes Tattoo Studio, Massage 90210, Up In Smoke Shop, Papa Joe's Barber Shop, Desert Spinal Care, and Cuts For Pups.

So let me start off by saying in no way at all would I consider myself a gun nut in any way, shape, or form. I happened to be in Vegas and met up with a friend who was taking his nephew out for a wild weekend in Sin City. He took his nephew out to a strip club. I passed on that adventure. But when he told me he was going here I was curious. A humvee came to pick them up at the Paris Casino and I hopped aboard as well not knowing what I was getting into. When we arrived at the location about ten minutes later we watched a tank crush a used car. Somebody paid 3 grand to dsomething like that on a YouTube video and completely amazing to see it right in front of you. My friend then spent a few bills on a package that let him and his nephew fire off enough rounds to kill two waves of zombies although from the looks of the targets when they brought them back to us I'm not sure we would have survived those waves intact. Myself I did an a la carte 25 rounds of an Uzi for 40 bucks. Yep it was fun. Looking at my target I definitely need more practice so I'll have to come back another time when I feel that urge. Place is run by folks who give off that ex-military vibe. They can send a humvee to pick you up and drop you off for a tip. Never been to the other places where you can fire off rounds in Vegas - New Frontier Armory, Shoot Las Vegas, Gun Garage, Strip Gun Club, Machine Guns Vegas so I can't compare but everything about this place was professional and safe. Your mileage, as always, may vary.

Came here with coworkers today and saw the dreaded 8.5 x 11 in the window that usually means NOPE, YOU AIN'T EATIN' HERE TODAY BIOTCHES!. There was some cryptic legalese all over it - all I caught was the word "lease" mentioned a number of times and we realized that we better think of another lunch destination ASAP. So save your gas, time, energy, etc - this place is no longer a contender for your sushi and Korean food dollars!

Came here a couple of times since a co-worker lives across the street and that made this a convenient place to meet. Same mall as Sweet Tomatoes and the southeastern branch of Los Reyes De La Torta. They've got a bicycle theme going - hence the name Spokes. Bicycle tires make up some of the decor and a few bicycles hang from the ceiling. When you walk in, you can go straight ahead to the back area of the bar or turn left and sit at one of the seats around the main bar. We sat at the bar and chilled. I had all sorts of crafty beers - can't remember the names now so I probably had too many. They give you a sheet with all the names of the available beers but I had to download the app instead - YES! they have a Spokes On Southern app! - mainly because I had to squint and use the flashlight app to read their tiny font beer list. Lindsey was our bartender/server and she was very nice - always smiling no matter what. Food - no soups in the summer, by the way. That was not mentioned on the 2 pager of a laminated menu. I had the turkey and bacon enchiladas. It hit the spot and was quite decent. Friends ordered the burger and Bruschetta Planks. This place also has one of those Touch Tunes jukeboxes you can control from your phone via app. Unlike most places, this jukebox doesn't block out any songs - even the usual censored "explicit" labelled ones. Pro tip: if you wanna get on Lindsey's good side, fill up the jukebox playlist with requests for Operation Ivy tunes. Will be back for sure sometime.

So I have a new place to go when I get that Chinese food craving. Szechwan to be exact. Yeah, there's a lot of hype, I know. AZ Republic food critic put this on the top 10 Chinese restaurants in the valley. Plus tons of butt-kissing rave reviews. Actual restaurant itself does look sketchy and not a place you want to spend a lot of time in so I always get it to go. You need to be driving westbound on Apache Boulevard to enter the little driveway that leads to a dirt lot that you can park in while running in to get your food. Lately they hired some woman that can speak English almost like a native speaker so there's much less miscommunication over the phone than before. I call in my orders then race down to pick up the meal. I've tried a bunch of dishes by now. Stuff that was just okay: Dan Dan Noodles (蓑衣黄瓜), cumin flavored lamb (孜然羊肉). Stuff that was adequate and good but not wow OMGWTFBBQ: mapo tofu (麻婆豆腐), fish flavor (Yu Xiang) Eggplant (鱼香茄子), stewed pork rib (红烧排骨). I really love their Cucumber in garlic sauce (蒜泥黃瓜) and spicy Cucumber (炝黃瓜). Pork belly in garlic sauce (蒜泥白肉) is so good but is also so fatty and salty that it couldn't possibly be good for you. I get it each time anyway - life's too short. My Chinese food place of choice at the moment. Cool thing is they're open till 10 every day. Usually when I go I'm the token gwai-lo both as far as staff and clientele go. Not sure about delivery but after seeing a few reviews describing horror stories I pick up my food myself.

Came here one night for a few beers and just to check it out. Place itself is pretty small - kinda weird shaped bar with a few seats here and there around it. There are also a bunch of tables filling up the rest of the bar. Atmosphere is homey, neighborhood bar kind of feel. A friend and I had a few Longboard pints as we spoke of this, that, and the other thing. On the way to the bathroom there's one of them Internet Jukeboxes/TouchTunes thingies on the wall. Men's bathroom has a swinging saloon door to get to the stall. Place wasn't crowded at all so we just drank and chilled. Then all of a sudden there was karaoke going on. Funny thing about this place is we witnessed three levels of karaoke that night. Your lowest level was made up of folks that never sang in school or church or whatever and just figured they could sing because they had a coupla more pints than usual and what the hey - I'm Elvis/Sinatra/Johnny Cash rolled into one! Those folks would be trying to stay on time with the words on the screen and trying to hit all the notes like they were playing some rigged Whack-A-Mole game at the county fair after being suckered by some unscrupulous carny. Pretty much a trainwreck most times - some even made familiar tunes completely unrecognizeable - which takes some genius level atonal compositional skills. Then there were the regular folks that could more or less sing at an amateur level and could carry the tune even if they missed a note here and there - the kind of folks you usually expect at karaoke places. But there were two folks at a third level. I can only describe it as OMGWTF. It was like some professional singers came into to practice a bunch of songs they happened to have on karaoke as a warm-up before either going into the studio or on tour. They had way too much control over their vocal cords to be casual karaoke weekender types. I'd even say they'd proably wipe the floor clean with most Top 40 autotuning dorks. Only problem is - if you're gonna sing your token Elvis song in every key but the one it's playing in, you probably don't wanna follow right after one of them. LOL. Place is in a mall that used to have a Fry's - it recently shut down. There's also an I Sushi & Teppan and Burger King in the same mall at the SE corner of Ray and Rural. Plenty of parking - it's in a mall where the biggest store is now closed. Will be back sometime.

Really! This place is worse than the previous incarnation - Hibachi Grill or whatever it was called. I was hoping that new name/new management = much better buffet. No dice. It was like eating at a bad cafeteria - vegetables oversalted, meat overcooked, and everything just generally bland. And the worst part is the Grand Opening banners are still up. Is this the best it's going to be? It was also quite pricey per person. If I'm paying that much I might as well go to Pacific Seafood Buffet. Pretty pricey but much better quality.   Meet the new buffet Same as the old buffet   I'll take a bite of the sweet orange chicken Take a bowl of the spicy egg drop soup Smile and grin at the fools all around me Pick up my tab and pay Just like yesterday And I'll get on my knees and pray We don't get fooled again

Interesting. I guess everyone has different experiences with this company. In my case I just needed to do a quick move as I had a deadline to move out and I was running out of time. I just needed all the big furniture moved using someone else's muscles and backbones. A friend suggested I rent a truck and spend a weekend doing it with his help - but when I did the math, it seemed worth it to pay a little more and leave the heavy lifting to someone else. The chiropractor bills alone would probably cost more than the service these guys provide. These guys give you a range of about an hour for when they'll show up. Luckily for me they showed up near the end of that range because I was still staging all the furniture near the entrance to help accelerate the whole process. The bulk of the time was taken up by the actual drive across town. Everything else was very quick and smooth. The two folks that did my move were VERY professional and quite obviously very experienced as they suggested things I didn't even consider to make the move go smoothly. The best part about it was that it was so quick and smooth I was able to go to work just an hour later than usual rather than having to take the whole day off just to do this.

Not sure where to even start with this place. Same mall as Yogi's and Culver's on the south side of Ray just west of the 101. Been meaning to try them and finally did. I got here after the lunch rush - about 1:30 or so and the staff here seemed to be completely OVERWHELMED. Not sure why because there weren't a whole lot of people. I wanted something "Al Patron" but was informed that it wasn't ready yet so please order either chicken or carne asada. Ok... so I ordered a carne asada burrito and elote - or as they call it here: America's Corn. So I first went to the salsa bar and wait - there WAS no salsa bar! Ok. Weird. Whatever. Sat down and chilled while waiting for my order. Other customers also put in their orders and also sat down to wait. And Wait. And wait. And wait. And Wait. And wait. And wait. Holy Chicken Molé batman! I ordered a simple burrito not a freaking Thanksgiving turkey that still needed thawing! FFS! So I watched various staff members run around delivering people's orders in frantic movements like I was watching some cross between a food-based reality show and one of those crazy Japanese game shows where people run around trying to perform tasks without slamming into each other. A Chinese fire drill basically. At least it helped pass the time since I didn't feel like playing that stupid game on my mobile device where you play angry muslim terrorist suicide bombers disguised as birdheads crashing into buildings and recreating 911 for every different level with the goal of killing every Yankee capitalist pig with the wreckage of an imploding building. Ok. Maybe that really isn't what the game is about but I was getting ravenous and started hallucinating like crazy. Then the burrito finally came! Oh joy! I noticed it was long but not very thick (that's what she said [rimshot], [cymbal crash]) - so there was really more tortilla than anything else. The meat tasted like it was marinated. Yup. But that's about it. Then I ate the corn. Squirted some lime over the cotija and took a few bites. Sorta bland. A bit of salt might have helped. There was some spicy sauce but that's not what I usually have over elote. Meh. At any rate I felt the food wasn't worth the price AND the long wait even though I was quite hungry. I was, in a word, UNDERWHELMED. Probably equal to the amount the staff seemed to be OVERWHELMED. So that's my take on America's Tacos. Checked off my "try this place" list but didn't make it to column B - the "hey I need to come back to this place again for sure!" list. But you don't have to take my word for it, Reading Rainbow fans! Check it out for yourselves. Your mileage may vary...

I came here on a Monday and my heart stood still Da doo ron-ron-ron, Da doo ron-ron Somebody told me that the Scorpion Sauce kills Da doo ron-ron-ron, Da doo ron-ron  Yeah. I've had beers from this brewery before - once they had their girls pushing caps and shades and free samples over at Fibber McGee's and I found that I really liked their Mandarin Wheat. So this is what I started out with one Monday evening. I was there with a friend who told me their Scorpion Sauce wings were a definite "contendah." I've been meaning to come here ever since I had the wings at Teakwoods. He was curious if the wings at Uncle Bear's could compare. Not that he was gonna take the challenge himself - but he knew I would. LOL. So the moment I ordered the wings grilled and re-tossed with the Scorpion Sauce the waitress got a serious look and asked if I was sure I was sure. Adding, of course, there are no returns/refunds if I can't handle it. Bah. Bring it on I said. Do I need to sign a waiver or something? She smiled and said it wouldn't be a bad idea. *I* was starting maybe this might turn out to be a bad idea. Another waitress came over and asked if I wanted gloves for the wings. I must have rolled my eyes and maybe gave her a look like "are you for real?" Because she immediately told me she was TOTALLY SERIOUS. So I agreed. Maybe that would avoid a tragedy when I accidentally rubbed my eyes later on that night. So when they brought the wings they also had what looked like surgical gloves in another tray. That kinda gave me a little chill like maybe I shoulda also called for a reverend and a hearse as well. So I dug into that first wing. I felt an immediate burn. Oh crap - here it goes but I asked for it. Definite habanero flavor and habanero burn. Instant and ongoing but not enough for me to put the chicken wing down. I got through four wings before I finally needed a swig of Mandarin Wheat in a tall glass. The burn was still ongoing but I made it through most of the wings before I finished my first glass of beer. Not long after I finished the rest of the wings and then finished my garlic parmesan fries I ordered on the side. It was quite a burning sensation in my mouth I admit - that Scorpion Sauce is no slouch. Heck maybe they should be displaying the Scorpion Sauce Material Safety Data Sheet to all challengers. Our waitress told us she was washing her hands really well after grabbing my empty beer glass each time. This is because she witnessed some guy try the Scorpion Sauce wings WITHOUT the gloves once and when he had to go to the men's restroom - well let's just say when he came back he was crying. Oops. I didn't ask for any more details but I was glad I wore the gloves. So how does the Scorpion Sauce rate against my standard for hottest wings (Teakwoods)? HOT. VERY VERY VERY HOT. But not AS hot as Teakwood's. I say this because I had to have TWO swigs of beer after every individual wings at Teakwood's and I finished four tall glasses of beer by the time I was done with all of them. ANd STILL felt the burn in my mouth. So Teakwood's still reigns as the king of hot wings but this is definitely next in line. Of course - judging by my standards. Your mileage may vary. Lotsa parking - it's in a big mall with lots of other stores. Monday night wasn't too crowded but I'm sure the place gets much more packed towards the weekend.

This is a heavy rotation item on the revolving wheel of locations on my "eat lunch with coworkers" list. I like the concept. Sorta like Chipotle for pizza. You can make your pizza exactly as your heart desires. You choose all your ingredients and they bake the pizza for you. As far as I recall, no matter what you add, price doesn't change. Lately I've actually been getting less ingredients because it is a lot of food for one sitting. Crust is really thin. Sometimes it gets a little burnt but for the most part they got it right the dozen or so times I've been here. Management even bent over backwards a few times I've been here when a coworker's pizza didn't come out exactly the way they ordered it. The idea is pretty damn good and I would be very surprised if they don't open more locations in the near future. Located in the Raintree Ranch mall at the southeast corner of Ray and North Price Road in a clusterfork of a mall designed by dyslexic insomniacs on peyote. I've been to the same location once before in it's previous life as Luke's Of Chicago with the same bunch of coworkers who all decided that the food was pretty much meh except for their onion rings - which were awesome. Unfortunately onion rings alone couldn't keep the place in business - but that's actually a win for the rest of us as well as for the folks who work at that Fired Pie location. :)

Came here one night for a work-related event and had a good time. This was the second time my workplace had an event here that I know of so it looks like it's good for that type of thing. It was a meet and mingle type of deal so I mostly met folks from our vendor and made LinkedIn contacts and did all that cheesy networking stuff. Our vendor's corporate culture centers around alcohol to a crazy level and we were all handed drink tickets like they grew on trees or something - it probably also helped that everybody who was expected to didn't show up due to other engagements so there was lots of extras. The food consisted of tacos, sliders, and boneless chicken wings. Also chips with some type of spinach dip. From looking at the menu on the website I take it our marketing folks opted for the Casual Get Together menu option. The tacos were the best item IMO. Everything else was just ok. I wasn't footing the bill so I didn't really care and the more drink tickets I cashed in even less so. Ended up keeping my gaming cards for another time since the mingling and drinking was the main point and the games were a distant second. Place is huge but it wasn't too crowded that night. Will probably come back again. If you like FlipSide or Dave & Buster's - you'll probably like this place. It's on that same road that keeps curving and passes by Total Wine as well as IKEA. Lots of parking since it has its own lot.

Came here on a Sunday night because my friend was jonesing for karaoke and this place has it 7 nights a week. Located in the Circus Jerkus casino which I would normally avoid but here we were. We Lyfted it over around 8pm or so and the place was pretty hopping. A number of families with little kids were seated near us so I guess you can so it's ok for families. Motley Crue gold records and guitars on the wall so it's like a Hard Rock Cafe centered around Motley Crue. A couple of the items are named after Motley Crue songs - Mac & Cheese Feelgoods Delight and Wild Side BBQ Bacon. I had the Wild Side BBQ Bacon. It was alright. I was starving. They had Lagunitas on draft of which I partook but their beer selection was rather limited. The karaoke host that night was very animated - not sure if I ever saw a host so full of energy. He would put on wigs and rock out with a blow-up guitar standing along the singer whenever they were singing a rock and roll type song. Either that or he would do a dance. Also he would give away prizes and keep the audience engaged with various tricks and audience participation games. The karaoke is done on a big stage and there is a little screen right in the middle where the lyrics get displayed. The microphone is even on a big microphone stand if you ever wanted to play rock star and channel your inner Steven Tyler or Vince Neil and do microphone stand tricks. Food was ok. Karaoke show was a bigger plus in my book. Disappointed that more menu items weren't named after Motley Crue songs. Here's a few suggestions: "Droppin' Like" Fries, Shout at the Devil Quesadilla, Smoke the Sky Salmon, Kickstart My Hearty Chili, Grilled, Grilled, Grilled Steak, Hammered Shrimp, Live Wire Burger, Knock 'Em Dead, Dip, Sticky Sweet Creme Brulee. Ok. I'll stop before someone gets violent. Extra point for karaoke good times otherwise the food and our kinda rude waiter would rate just a three. Your mileage, as always, may vary - just don't get caught smokin' in the boys room.

Came here after work to have dinner and drinks with a friend. It was a slow Monday night and we were one of the only customers there. No matter - we were here just to chill and enjoy libations and some food. They have their own food truck - Duke's Express and it was parked outside not far from where I parked. I figured if they have their own food truck - the way Hungry Monk's does, then there should be a big emphasis on the food - bit more than your average sports bar. So anyway, I started out with a few pints of Mr. Pineapple from the San Tan Brewery that they have on tap - solid choice. I ended up ordering the chicken fried steak over mashed potatoes with gravy. It was pretty good - I would actually go back and order it again but I want to try some of their other items that seem to be popular like the mac and cheese with bacon. Looks good in the photo and I'm sure it wasn't photoshopped. They have one of those TouchTunes jukeboxes like most bars seem to have these days. Maybe Monday early evening isn't the time to go because right as we were leaving people seemed to be coming in. Place is in the mall on the northwest corner of Ray and Rural. Entrance is at the north side. Plenty of parking - it's a mall.

Came here once way back around the time it first opened and recognized some of the folks from Yupha's. Came here again recently and realized that the menu and presentation is almost identical to Yupha's as well. Wait a minute. Who am I fooling - I always just get the red curry from the lunch menu anyways so I wouldn't have noticed any difference. :P I'd say quality is the same as Yupha's. It's just a little further away but it's on the lunch rotation for when we're craving Thai but don't want to run into folks from work. In the same mall as Teakwood's and Jersey's Tavern. Plenty of parking.

This is the Sonoran hot dog street vendor that sets up every day around 6pm at the northern edge of the Gorman's (Gorman Cooler Supply) parking lot just at the southwest corner of 35th and Thomas. Been here a number of times over the years. This is where I had my first Sonoran style hot dog. Went drinking with a friend at Las Portales and we came out one night and there this place was. Back then I ordered the Mexican chocolate drink and I think they had elote back then. I did not see elote the last time I went a few days ago but we came just before they closed at 1AM. They actually stay open till 3AM on Fridays and Saturdays. This location only takes cash so make sure you have some before coming here. I'm sure the majority of folks that come to this location are coming out of either Las Portales or Chica's - both of which are a hop, skip, and a jump away. The hot dogs are wrapped in bacon with crema and a bunch of other stuff. Really hits the spot after a night of bar hopping. Guy running this place gave me a loyalty card and when I looked at it, I realized it's not just this one location - this is just a node in the El Caprichoso Sonoran Hot Dog EMPIRE! Other locations are:  1) 2122 E. Van Buren 3) 9444 N. 19th Ave 4) 1118 N. 35th Ave 5) 406 N. 16th St 6) 2901 W. Van Buren 7) 4027 N. 27th Ave  This particular location is their #2 location. The only other one I've been to is the 19th avenue one. I like the hot dogs here better though. Perhaps there's slight variations among the various locations. Plenty of parking in the Gorman's parking lot as that business is closed at night. I'm pretty sure the other locations have a similar arrangement. Might want to brush up on your basic Spanish as well since the folks running the place speak little English. There was a guy in our group of misfits that was fluent in Spanish and that saved us from any communication barrier that might have existed if he wasn't with us.

So I was driving through Maricopa the other day and decided I was getting a little hungry. I'd driven almost non-stop from San Diego with very few breaks and it was about here that I was feeling the consequences. So I searched through Yelp for something in Maricopa that wasn't the Maricopa location of some freaking chain restaurant. Oddly enough, this so called Soul Food Shak came up and caught my eye as something out of the ordinary. It wasn't part of the main mall area of Maricopa so I figured it'd be a little adventure as well. Going north on the 347 (North John Wayne Parkway) you turn southeast on the Casa Grande Highway right after crossing the railroad tracks. Is it on the wrong side of the tracks? Who the hell cares? It's Maricopa. BFE. One step above Gila Bend which was the crappy little town I used to have to drive through when coming from San Diego when I lived on the Wesside. So Maricopa might be a few notches above that. So a few moments eastward and you'll spot the shotgun shack on the right hand side. Can't miss it. It's in the Stage Stop Market Place by the Calvary Chapel. Lotsa parking. Bring cash. Ignore the Square sticker on the window - they don't have that anymore. So the guy with the grill is pretty chill - not sure if he was Uncle D but I got the catfish dinner. COmes with catfish, tartar sauce, Louisiana hot sauce (I'm guessing but that's what it tasted like), and whatever sides you ordered. I ordered the cole slaw and collard greens. Cole slaw was ok. Catfish was pretty standard. I would definitely get the collard greens again though. To be fair, I came on a day that the full menu wasn't available. I really would have loved to try the ribs but they are only available on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Oh. I forgot to mention that the dinner came with a slice of cake. Homemade Butter Glaze Cake. I'll be passing through Maricopa someday again and I'll have to try the other stuff I missed - okra, rib tips, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, chicken strips, fried pickles, baked beans, potato salad, etc. This first experience I would rate as 3.5 stars but I'll round an extra star up for being a funky place that's not a chain and offers an alternative to all that Sysco crap.

How have I not reviewed this place yet? A definite part of our work lunch rotation when we're actually really hungry - because you get a lot of food - your order, the banchan, and sometimes some complementary egg. Sometimes someone in our group wants sushi while someone else hates sushi but will order the meats. So this place sort of satisfies everybody in the group. I usually get the Korean food choices. So far I've had the Fresh Water Eel Hot Stone Rice Bowl, the Spicy Pork Belly, Oxtail Soup, Kalbi, and probably a few I've forgotten. The food has always been good. We leave pretty satisfied each time. Service is sometimes very good and sometimes lacking but that's usually only when they're shorthanded. They have a handful of booths and a number of round tables that can seat four people. Two large screens that usually show news. This place is closer for us than Hodori and Chodang so that pretty much seals it that they will be the ones satisfying our Korean food cravings. It's in the same mall as Lee Lee's on the NE corner of Warner and Dobson. Parking is plentiful but watch out - the parking lot itself is a wreck! It's full of potholes and areas that are badly in need of resurfacing.

So I've been here twice. First time I got the Truffle Mushroom Swiss and some Smashfries. To go. It was alright. Wasn't overwhelmed - I was hungry and it hit the spot. Next time I came with some coworkers. We were all excited because here was a new place pretty close to where we work and it could be high on our lunch rotation. But that idea came to a crashing halt when we got our food. This time I got the Spinach, Cucumber and Goat Cheese burger. I know. Sounds pretty metrosexual but I was curious. I also got the Haystack Onions. Well when I bit into the burger, I had to wonder if Bessie, the cow I was biting into, hadn't fallen in love with the salt lick and continously deep throated it for the rest of her days. Dang burger was salty as heck. The Haystack Onions were too. I would have let it slide if it were just me. My coworkers, however, said the same thing. It took the three of us to finish the haystack onions because I could not have more than just a bit of that oversalted mess. Service was pretty sucky too. The Einstein that brought the first burger took away the number on the table so the next guy that brought the rest of the burgers only knew to stop at our table because we flagged him down. Yeah yeah. The place is still "new." So this is the moment - like in a game of Hearts when somebody drops the queen of spades or some card with hearts on it - breaking hearts, as they say. I'm dropping a turd in this circle jerk of a punchbowl with everybody dropping five stars all around. We ain't coming back. Sorry. Smashburger apparently isn't for everyone.

I've been here once to this exact location when it was a Wendy's - for morning biscuits and sausage and some sludge that they called coffee. I tried it and ACK! Ended up pouring it out on the sidewalk in memory of the tastebud and synapse homies that died from the shock of that horrid flavor. I poured out more of that liquid diarrhea onto the sidewalk and prayed to the Goddess Caffeina that an actual Starbucks will one day rise up in the spot that the unworthy breakfast food and drink wannabe had inhabited. About a year later, my prayers had been answered - an actual Starbucks sure enough did replace Wendy's. Yeah!!!!! Opened pretty recently - I love what they did to the interior - nice wood panelling and the layout blows away what Wendy's had. Wendy's had the kitchen at the south end of the building. This new Starbucks has the cashiers and barristas at the southwest end. Service is as quick and easy as pretty much any Starbucks. They kept the drive-thru though so that's a plus. If you're gonna hang out with your laptop here long term, the southwestern most tables that are against a wall as opposed to a window view both have two outlets right underneath them. Lots of parking in this mall where Basha's is the anchor and there is lots of vacant retail space just waiting to be snatched up.

Went here thinking I'd check out the new Microsoft store. What a colossal waste of time. Everything in here is available in any Best Buy or Fry's Electronics store. Why does this store even need to exist? I Walked through the store and was completely ignored by all the employees there - seems like their brains had blue-screened and their personalities won't be activated till the next service pack. The XBox seemed to be the most advertised item as I saw it everywhere. Funny that the XBOX posters proudly announce that it's bundled with Assassin's Creed Unity - a game with more freaking bugs than Lindsay Lohan's crotch. Hell - even the usual mallrats that seem to overwhelm Apple stores stay away from this place. 50 SHADES OF FAIL!

Came here for a company-sponsored event and hey - that means "all you can drink" so we got here early even. Hung out at the bar for a while. Mostly piss and shite on tap so I stuck to Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy in a can - best beer for lakes and state parks where they don't allow you to bring beer in bottles cause of their no glass policy. So we chilled and got toasted on the company dime while the rest of our co-workers showed up. Once we were all there we went upstairs in a big group to where we had a number of bays in a row rented out for our use. Some of the folks we work with are avid golfers who do this all the time. Me? Not so much. But there's nothing like getting toasted and slamming a little ball out into wherever - especially once someone told me to imagine that little golf ball is your boss. Bam! You hit that little booger out and I guess you're supposed to aim for various targets and a series of concentric circles around them decide what your score is depending on where your ball landed. Didn't matter - I was playing a different game than everyone else was apparently - just taking out my frustrations on a little white ball. Then food came. It was mostly little sliders, chicken fingers and chips - stuff you can get at most dive bars. Not ever gonna reminisce about that when talking about TopGolf. Afterwards when it got dark and our time was up we headed back downstairs to the bar. Got more drinks. Then someone had the idea of playing giant Jenga upstairs so we went to this courtyard type area where you can order from a bar and they also had a bunch of giant Jenga bricks. Stupid kid's game but it's fun after you had enough to become a stupid kid again. Played a few games and then my designated driver had to leave so I went too. All in all great place for a company-sponsored event. Not sure if I'd ever come on my own but I'm not a golfer anyway. Lots of parking - they have a pretty big lot. Your mileage, as always, may vary greatly.

So I was coming back from dinner further south on the strip when I heard some loud music and a group of people gathered around watching the scene - employees inside this booth were dancing to the music and putting on a show. I watched for a moment with amusement and after the song was over most people left. I just realized that I had had Turkish ice cream before years ago - in Tokyo Disneyland of all places. They called it Dondurma or トルコ風アイス and the guy serving it usually puts on a show stretching the ice cream - carnival like - sorta like the way you see pizza makers flip their dough. So I decided to get a tiny portion in a cup - paid in cash since they charge extra for purchases under ten dollars on a credit card. Walked over to the corner where I was further entertained by a doomsday preacher bent on saving souls from Sin City. The chocolate hazelnut ice cream had that Turkish ice cream consistency I remember - gooey and stretchy and each spoonful stretched in a gooey strand from the cup to my mouth. This aspect of the ice cream makes it easy to get on your clothes so be careful. Not too sweet so I liked that as well. I'm usually not much of a sweets/ice cream guy but this is the first time I saw a place in the states that serves this stuff. so I just had to have it - had to! After preacherman's novelty wore off I went up the bridge and crossed north over Flamingo to the other side where there was more entertainment - this time a singer/saxophonist playing Pink Floyd songs. Good times! Place is in the Grand Bazaar Shops on the strip outside Bally's. They also serve other food items other than ice cream but I had already had dinner - maybe next time.

Surimi I don't like it Not the Zupas Not the Zupas  Apologies to Joe Strummer and pals. Hmmm. Friend of mine likes this place for some reason and wants to meet here for dinner often enough. We usually get a soup and a sandwich but every soup I've had here seems to be high on salt - enough salt to get you high. Maybe it's just me but meh. Also their krab sandwiches have that fake crab - I get it - real crab is more expensive but I'd rather pay more and get the real thing or not have it at all. Place is in the strip mall restaurant row between the 101 to the east and Chandler village drive to the west. Plenty of parking. Probably won't be back. Friend will have to suck it up and agree on another place.

So I came in here the other night with a friend and whoa, dude - deja vu! I've been here before - I know it. Something about the location and the layout of the bar and then it hit me - it used to be All Starz Sports Bar & Grill back in the beginning of the century. Used to come here with coworkers for karaoke and trivia back when work was only a few blocks away. Not even sure what it was afterwards but this is the 2015 version. Someone spent some money on the decor and furniture for sure. So we sat down and ordered a bunch of craft beers. Everything I tried from Black Magic was meh. But Grapefruit Hefeweizen I liked enough to get twice. TouchTunes was blaring country music while we were there. Waitresses were nice but they kind of worked in a tag team so we were never really sure which one was OUR waitress or if any one waitress was really "ours" - we just went with the first one who asked us if we wanted another beer. For food I went with a 1/2 pound burger with cheddar and Jager Bacon with garlic fries. It was good and came out the way I like it. I also tried some of the empanadas. I prefer empanadas baked and not deep fried so that's probably not something I'd get again. Bathroom was surprisingly actually clean - when I'm at a crowded bar I usually don't expect or pay much attention to this detail LOL. It's in a mall at the southeastern corner of Rural and Chandler at the eastern corner of the strip mall. They have lots of tv screens, pool, darts, all your usual bar suspects - even live music on the weekends. Plenty of parking - it's a mall. Will be back.

So I'm Ghana tell you a story about the last time I got together with co-workers for a lunch outing. I was the one stuck with driving everyone and when that happens it's no longer a democracy- I'm Stalin - or for the sake of this review and to be continentally accurate I was instead Mobutu Sese Seko and anyone that didn't wanna go where I wanted to could just GTFO out of the already moving vehicle Hollywood action movie style. Of course I had to deal with the predictable protests about getting ebola/AIDS/Ghanaria/Sleeping Sickness/Malaria/Tuberculosis/etc - just from going to the restaurant which made me realize I'm dragging these fools way out of their freaking comfort zone. The place is called Max's Mukhaase Restaurant and Catering Service. Mukaase means 'kitchen' in Akan, a language spoken over much of the southern half of Ghana. Got that? There's gonna be a quiz. Anyway, we got seated and a Max introduced himself and gave us all menus. I decided to go for the Fufu/Goat Light Soup as it's called on the menu. The menu could use a little more in the descriptions and actually labelling the pictures. Now the one negative or "con" here is that although the food is made to order the dishes all came out very slowly until a few of my co-workers - one of them a contract worker figured that by the time we're done and get back and his manager calculates the amount of time he was out on lunch - he'd definitely be a Ghana. (rimshot). Thank you, try the Fufu and Goat soup! That's the last Ghana joke - I promise. So we all decided if we're coming back it's for dinner - on the weekends because they're not open for dinner on the regular weekdays so we won't be in a hurry to get back.    So when I got my Fufu and Goat Light Soup a woman also brought a bowl of water for me to wash my hands in because you usually eat the fufu with your hands and break off little pieces. I quickly told them I would eat it with fork and spoon. Yeah. Diehard Western ingrained ideas of how to eat a soup suddenly took over for a moment. Even so I ended up eating the last pieces of goat with my hand anyway. Soup was tomato based and rather spicy. Goat was good - a little chewy which is why I finally ate the rest of the pieces by hand. Fufu - a mixture of cassava and plantains - consistency - close as I can think of in comparison is Japanese mochi or specifically ozoni that is served for New Year's. Not really having any flavor - rather playing the straight man to the spicy soup and the goat meat. One of my co-workers had the hot pepper sauce - I tried a bit of it and according to everyone on my table my face turned red all of a sudden - even though I didn't feel it was that hot. They have a few items for folks for whom just walking through the door to a Ghanaian restaurant was already too much of an adventure to handle - club sandwich, burger, sausage roll, and a hot dog. Vegetarians can get the stuffed zucchini with peanut butter sauce or the catering pasta. There's also a bunch of dishes that are only available on the weekend. Lotsa parking cause it's in a mall. Below is a cheat sheet for help with the menu:  JOLLOF ("one pot") rice - usually made with rice, tomatoes and tomato paste, onions, salt, and hot red pepper. Beyond that, nearly any kind of meat, vegetable, or spice can be added.  WAAKYE - a Ghanaian dish of cooked rice and black-eyed peas coloured with an indigenous leaf to make it purple-brown. It is prepared by boiling the beans and rice together. GARI - cassava tubers peeled, washed and grated or crushed to produce a mash after being drained for a few days then fried in a clay frying pot. Comes in either white (fried without palm oil) or yellow (fried with palm oil). FUFU - boiled starchy food made from cassava and plantains pounded into a dough-like consistency with a pestle and mortar. RED RED - a Ghanaian black-eyed peas and meat stew served with fried ripe plantain that earns its name from the red pepper and red palm oil that tints the black-eyed peas stew and the bright orange color of the fried ripe plantain. BANKU - is a Ghanaian dish which is cooked by a proportionate mixture of fermented corn and cassava dough in hot water into a smooth, whitish consistent paste and then wrapped in plastic KENKEY - similar to a sourdough dumpling - usually made from ground corn mixed with water and fermented for a few days - then half of it is cooked and then mixed with the other uncooked half throughly and wrapped in banana leaves or corn husks.  EGUSI - Sauce usually made from roasted finely ground or pureed egusi (a melon resembling a watermelon found in West Africa) seeds that give it a smoky, nutty character. Pumpkin seeds are sometimes used instead.  TUO ZAAFI - dish originating in Northern Ghana consisting primarily of maize dough with salt and water to taste SPHE BOLG (Spaghetti Bolognese) - Boiled spaghetti with Oil, fresh tomatoes, minced beef, white pepper, mixed herb, salt, gravy, cheese.

So I was a little bored one evening and decided to finally try this place months after the hype of grand opening. I figured by now the hour long lines will be long gone and everybody in Maricopa County had tried it at least once by now. So I get to the northeast corner of McClintock and E Rio Salado Parkway and enter a real clusterfork of a parking lot. Since the drive through lane is pretty big and surrounds Portillo's you have to park off to the east where there are signs telling you that you can only go in one direction. There is more parking beyond what you initially see when you first enter the area though. Pretty much all the parking right in front near the entrance are handicapped parking stalls. Fortunately, Portillo's was a late afterthought/addition to this mall so it has its own corner and is pretty much completely separate from the rest of the mall. An island of Chicago in a Tempe mall. If I remember correctly it's more or less the same corner that Nita's Hideaway used to be on many eons ago. So you come in and see multiple areas - one for phone order pickup, and all the way in back a place that you place your order. You then walk halfway across the restaurant after ordering and listen for your number. Everything comes in a thick brown plastic tray with four drink holders. So I ordered a standard fountain drink as well as a Maxwell Street Polish dog, a bowl of chili, and a tamale. Hadn't eaten all day more or less so I was hungry. Luckily it was not very crowded and I found some seating right away. I would hate to have to eat a hotdog in a hallway. So anyway, the hot dog was delicious - especially with the grilled onions sprinkled on top and with a bit of mustard as well. But no ketchup. Which is good because as Dirty Harry once said "Nobody, I mean NOBODY puts ketchup on a hot dog!" So that was the best part of the meal. Then I had the chili. Came with cheese and onions. It was alright. I like the chili at Lobby's better though. Truth. Finally - the tamale. It was wrapped in foil and then again in several layers of the kind of paper you wrap food to go in. It was one long greasy gut bomb. Pretty much plain masa and what tasted like the sauce in the chili inside it. Perhaps it's that toddling town's version of a tamale and if I was an ex-pat homesick for the Windy City I might have enjoyed it much more as the nostalgia kicked in. But since I'm NOT from Chitown and have only been once in my life for a couple of days when I was grade school age I was just curious as to what their tamales tasted like. Fortunately curiosity didn't kill the cat but instead gave him about 3 or 4 swift kicks to the stomach and a stern warning. NEVER EAT THOSE AGAIN. All night I felt my stomach churn and I'm sure the tamale was the the cause of it. If you ate 5 or 6 of those you'd be a walking tear gas/pepper spray cannister. So after I was more or less satisfied I walked back out into the night and noticed that the closest store in the rest of the mall to Portillo's just happens to be Lane Bryant. I guess if you become a REALLY big fan of Portillo's that is rather conveniently located. I'm sure I'll be back again one day.
