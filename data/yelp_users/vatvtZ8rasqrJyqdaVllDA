I have come to Kat's several times and will continue to visit my former favorite watering hole (Ligouri's). Last weekend I attended Karaoke night and was quite pleased. I will recommend Kat's now and forever and hope  this place never changes!

I really like this little dive bar and was quite taken back by the fact they were shut down yesterday. I'm a frequent visitor, and they have a decent selection on the jukebox (touchtunes). The food is typical bar fare, but decent.. got a kickin' deal on chicken wings on a Monday night. I hope they recover because they are the best thing for a dive bar fan in Gilbert!

I love this salon. It was clean, professional and I got great service. Tony was great at my full set, and Nana gave me the best pedicure! Come to Lover Nails, you wont regret it!

I returned to DOS GRINGOS MESA only to be highly offended and disgusted, The first time I went the Margaritas were awesome, this time THEY WERE SO HORRIBLE! They had a comedy night which was so horrid, and annoying! I will never revisit this bar again!
