I'm shocked to see any negative reviews regarding Atlasta as we only have amazing things to say and remember from our experience with them.   To start, Atlasta is one of the more affordable caterers we reviewed for our wedding day. Our tasting ran smoothly and they allowed us to bring in my maid of honor as well. They were so accommodating to our budget, provided enough vendor meals to cover all of our hard working staff, brought in beautiful decor to work with our existing wedding theme, and helped with day of/ last minute requests (i.e. Our bartenders did not have lemonade for our signature drink and Alice from Atlasta quickly fixed the situation and brought lemonade for them to use).   I am so grateful for Atlasta's amazing customer service, quick response and attention to detail.   Thank you, than you for our amazing dinner!!!

Though I realize the holidays is a stressful and busy time, quality customer service, even mediocre is necessary. The management is a grumpy Scrooge of a fellow. He gave glaring looks at most of the guests and clearly hated life... And his job. If you're planning on eating here, think twice.  The two stars are for the hard working employees sweating away in front of the grill. Kudos for their hard work and patience to work with a Scrooge.

The Croft Downtown is such a wonderful wedding venue and even more amazing, their crew is beyond professional and accommodating. When we found out our venue closed 2 months before our wedding, The Croft was able to take us in and keep our original wedding date as well. Mark and Angela were able to review our existing vendors and communicate with them directly to confirm that although a few of them were not on their approved vendor list, they would have peace of mind knowing they will meet their standards. I appreciate that this is important to them and shows how much they care about their name in this industry. What we were not able to keep as vendors were our florists because of their sister company, Angelic Grove. Angela took the time to sit down with me to review several picture inspirations of floral and decor furniture. She worked with our floral budget and even found ways to help us find savings in furniture rentals! I came with a very bohemian theme (which isn't what you typically see at the Croft with their chic and elegant events) but Angela helped us tie our vision together to work cohesively within their space. I think it's important for brides to not get too caught up with Pinterest and force a look into a venue that may not be organically sound. I'm so appreciative of their help with this as they have several years of experience planning weddings outside of the Croft and can speak to concerns that may not be obvious to the bride.   The team allowed us to come to the venue a couple of days before our wedding to run our rehearsal and confirm any last minute details with vendors and decor. They even stayed later for us because we ran a little late! Additionally The Croft had TWO weddings back to back the weekend of our wedding. I never once felt neglected, received feedback right away to my emails/ texts, and they went above and beyond to make sure we felt our wedding is as important to them as it is to us. Proof of this is the fact that their team was willing to flip the direction of their pews in the Abbey Room for our Saturday wedding knowing they will have to flip them back again the very next day!   After receiving our pictures from our photographer, I can't help but fall in love (again) with this venue. The venue has endless chandeliers (FYI chandeliers are VERY expensive to rent from other companies but come free with your rental package), beautiful ambiance no matter what room you are standing in, and it's both industrial and romantic at the same time. To be honest, it really doesn't take a lot of effort to decorate this space because it is a statement on its own!   I can't thank Mark, Angela and crew enough for opening their space to us. If I had to do it again, I would have booked with the Croft from the very beginning!
