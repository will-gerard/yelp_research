The food was very good for the price. I had the #23 (Noodles, eggrolls, beef, shrimp) for $8 or so and could only half of it. They want a $10 minimum purchase to process credit/debit cards.   The service was a little slow, but we go out to eat for the social aspect. There were quite a few people coming in for takeout.   The restaurant is smaller. There are about 8-10 tables.

When first walking in to Stingray Sushi, a low-lit bamboo themed restaurant greets you. At the entrance there is a fish tank under the floor... and that was the best thing about this place... We ordered the Yakiniku and the Hew Do Bow.   The Yakiniku's stir-fried Asian vegetables were ok, I couldn't really tell with the whole meal being drowned in Korean Soy Sauce.  The Hew Do Bo should be renamed to the Edgar Allan Poe*, because this meal was worthy of being buried under the floorboards and it left me with feelings of regret.   If I were invited into Stingray Sushi again, I would not venture too far from just eating Sushi...  * Edgar Allan Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart"

The food was really good, especially for the $7 or so I spent. This particular location is next to the ASU campus and there were quite a few college students enjoying lunch. I am defiantly going there again for a quick and quality meal.
