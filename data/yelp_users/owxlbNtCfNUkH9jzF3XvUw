Oh, I'm sure you've visited a handful soda shops and diners that are strategically spruced up to give the illusion that they're retro.  Well, with Macalpine's, there's no illusion.  It's legitimate.  I mean, the place has been in business since 1929, which is quite a testament in a modern-obsessed city like Phoenix.  In fact, I'm not sure much has been done to the place in terms of renovations, as the business itself both looks and smells its age.  I'll be honest, the food here isn't really anything to write home about.  The toasted cheese (my personal favorite) and the generously gigantic club sandwich are good, but I can't say much about their burgers and dogs.  If I only cared about food, my rating would be lower.  But we don't come here for the food - we come here for the sweets! More specifically, the drinks.  You can request an egg cream or a phosphate.  Do you kiddies know what those are?  They'll be happy to explain them to you, if not.  But the delicious ice cream sodas are the reason for our repeat visits. There are many combinations worth trying, most notably the Velvet Elvis, Bozo, German Chocolate, Hubba Bubba, or even your own sugary concoction.   There's also a variety of sundaes all made using Thrifty ice cream, but we've never quite made it that far.   In addition to the actual restaurant, there's also a thrift store that sells various used items.  I've never bought anything, but always like looking around.  An archaic dentist chair, cigarette machine, and old school irons.  I consider the place an homage to a time when home appliances weren't all made out of plastic.  There's also a room entirely dedicated to clothing, which I often imagine is where kids take their grandparents' wardrobes after they die.  Service is always good, prices are fair, and you're unlikely to find another place quite like this in Phoenix.  I recommend trying it out!

Being a massive fan of Pizzeria Bianco, it's kind of hard to approach its spin-off establishment, Pane Bianco, from an unbiased standpoint.  The restaurant's concept is slightly different than the pizzerias, as it seems to have garnered the reputation that, despite offering dinner, being more of a local lunch spot that primarily serves focaccia sandwiches.     Over the years, I've had many sandwiches here and have never been disappointed.  The house mozzarella and wood-roasted pepper combination, as well as the sopressata with aged provolone, are two of my absolute favorites.  Every day, they also offer a market sandwich, which uses locally sourced ingredients.  These can vary greatly, making it impossible to try everything that is offered.  The fact is, few of these sandwiches ever disappoint.  The ingredients are always top notch and the bread used for the sandwiches is what I've come to expect from Bianco.  The only downside is that I do feel that prices are unreasonably high, especially considering I can get a whole pizza for what they charge for some of the market ones.  There's a fine line between charging for quality as opposed to charging because of "brand" recognition.  However, they do make every effort to source out locally, so you can't really complain too much.    One of the true gems at Pane is their pizza al taglio.  This is more along the lines of the traditional "by the slice" pizza squares that I feel is a style more people are familiar with.  It's extremely well done and we insist on splitting a square of it during every single visit.  On most days, they only offer a tomato sauce with cheese, but we've also spotted a Rosa-inspired version and ultra-cool variations that I've always wanted to try.  We've been putting off going to dinner here for the longest time.  Mainly because the full-range of pizzas can be had elsewhere, meaning that we'd essentially just order the same thing that we'd order at Town and Country. Although they might have a few specials that are unique, the plates are pretty consistent with the pizzeria restaurants in terms of their alternative dishes.  Desserts are also mostly what you'd find at their other locations, including the so-so flourless chocolate cake, delicious Italian ice, and if you're lucky, their superbly made "seasonal" tres leches cake that always seems to be in season.  Parking here can sometimes be a real pain!  Not because of the Pane diners, but because the nearby Lux coffee shop clogs up the lot due to its massive popularity as a local hipster hangout.   I might update this review when we finally cave and go here for dinner. But for now, Pane will remain one of my favorite lunch spots that I can't resist giving a strong recommendation to!

Since I use a warranty company for my repairs (One Guard), it's unlikely that I'd ever use Howard Air for AC issues.  For this reason, I can't speak of their products or their prices.  But I can at least speak for the competence and professionalism of their technicians.  My warranty company had a technician come out with a smaller company. They misdiagnosed my AC unit twice, swapping out two separate parts tied into my zone control that did not fix the issue.  I had to pay for these repairs, as they were not covered under my warranty.  Much to my dismay, both fixes failed!  After being without air for two weeks while this company "researched" my unit, I decided to seek out a second opinion from Howard Air.  Since I had invoices, the second opinion did not cost me anything.  It's nice to see that I can call and get a technician out at practically any time of the day or night, including a Saturday evening (which my current repair people would never do).    A technician (Colin B) quickly diagnosed the REAL issue with my AC (bad thermal expansion valve).  A good tech versus an incompetent one can make a world of difference.  Thanks to the technician being able to identify the actual issue, I should be able to get my air fixed through my warranty, while hopefully getting the money refunded to me for the incorrect trial and error repairs this other company made me do.  Nice to see that there's some competent technicians out there!

Aside from a one-time visit to Binkley's in Cave Creek last year, my girlfriend and I really don't have much experience with fine-dining.  After seeing Kai constantly popping up on Phoenix' "Best Of" lists, I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about.  We made a reservation for the weekend of my 34th birthday, which we booked pretty far in advance.  We were definitely not disappointed.  The quality (and taste) of the food, the attention to detail, and courteousness of the servers are all top notch. We were referred to by our names by the staff, well accommodated with specific requests, and felt as comfortable as you can be in an environment that can be somewhat intimidating if you're unfamiliar with it.  Both my girlfriend and I debated on whether to order the 7-course Short Story or 13-course Journey from the tasting menu.  Ultimately, we decided on the Short Story, which despite the name, ended up being more than enough food to satisfy us.  Their menus feature beautiful Native American paintings, each having a distinct back-story that was described in great detail by our server.  Every dish had a story, including some of the tiniest details on the plates that we'd probably overlook if we weren't paying attention.  We received a wide variety of different breads to try, along with local olive oil.  All were incredibly unique and incredibly delicious.  After devouring the original three, they brought out three different ones for us to try.  We received a potato puree soup, which was absolutely phenomenal (and I don't even like soup!).    Since I expressed to our server that I don't like seafood, my Three Sisters (scallops) was swapped out with a foie gras.  Initially, I was hesitant, as once again, I don't really like liver - but I guess that's because I've never had good liver, because this was superb!  Even my girlfriend's scallops, which I'd normally not even go near, were actually done very well.  I guess if there's one thing that I learned after dining here, it's that you don't necessarily know what you like and dislike until you've actually tasted things done exceptionally well.  The cold sorbet we received as a palette cleanser actually startled me by the amount of purely natural flavor it contained.  The tribal buffalo we received as a main entree (cooked medium well - don't judge!), was some of the best meat I've ever had, with the chorizo adding in a spice that adds mild heat, but not to the point where it's offensive.  The global artisan tray contained a wonderful cheddar-like cheese from England and a brutally potent blue cheese that lingered on our palettes long after we finished.  For dessert, we received sweet potato cake that included a tamarind sorbet, which was extremely good.  When we return, however, I'd love to try their fry bread and tribute to chocolate full-plate desserts, as it looks like they have many exciting options that I'd expect great things from.  After picking up my car with the valet, we found a hand-written card, two bottles of water, and some chocolates. They couldn't have done it any better!  In summary, Kai is an experience that you must try - if only once.  The food, the service, the atmosphere, and the whole experience definitely puts it at the top of my list as one of the best dining experiences we've ever had.  Recommended to the highest extent possible!

I remember back in the "Neon 90s" when shopping for electronics was a completely different experience than today.  Retailers like Best Buy, Circuit City, and Ultimate Electronics weren't staffed with minimum wage teenagers, but actual salesman.  Some honest, some sleazy, and some downright pushy.  They got paid on commission, similar to car salesman. Although annoying, these people were actually more knowledgeable than the teens who work the store today.  Few know any real information about what they're selling, other than generic garbage they've been taught in staff training.  I recall just a few years ago, I'd always end up haggling with managers about trying to get them to price match Amazon.  Many of them refused, claiming they could lose their job, while others didn't have an issue doing so.  I would often shake my head in astonishment, wondering just when this company would "get with the program" and learn that if they don't adapt their sales methods, they will quickly suffer the fate of their competitors.  In present day, Best Buy has made some improvements towards being more competitive with online retailers, but I still feel that it's only a matter of time before they go under.  There are many reasons as to why, but I'll point out the most notable ones.  Once, I attempted to make a return for a television that I had purchased at another store.  Since Thunderbird was more conveniently located for the plans my girlfriend and I made that evening, we decided to stop by there.  After being hassled by some sassy teenage girl, she asked me: "Why don't you just return it to the store you bought it from?"  And with comments like this, should anyone be surprised why they have such a horrible reputation?  Now, for the big one:  Whenever you buy something, the Best Buy employees will tell you: "Just try it out.  If you don't like it, you have 15 days to return it.  No hassle."  Is this accurate?  Well, that depends.  If you've never returned anything before, then sure.  But if you return one too many items, you'll receive a 90-day ban on returns.  Basically, this means that you can still purchase items, but you can't return them.  Buy an iPad and the screen is shattered upon unboxing?  Too bad!  Purchase a two thousand dollar TV and find that it has a dead pixel or a cloudy screen?  Tough luck!    When I was shopping for TVs a few years ago, I ran into a string of bad luck and purchased several TVs that all seemed to have one issue or another.  A Samsung plasma buzzed like an angry hornets' nest to the point where it was unwatchable.  A Panasonic plasma suffered from a cluster of dead pixels.  All of these returns were actually unboxed and inspected in order to confirm that they were defective and that I wasn't simply just making up tales for the sake of getting my money back.  It doesn't matter.  All of these returns are slaps on the wrist, being logged into a third-party database.  Every time you give them your ID, you assume it's done to simply verify your identify.  In actuality, it's used to log your information, so an outside source can keep tabs on your return activity.  If all retailers used this method, my girlfriend would be forced to wear an anklet to ensure that she doesn't go within 200 miles of a Kohls store.  Best Buy uses a company called The Retail Equation (TRE).   If you'd like to know how consumers feel about them, just read their Yelp page.  I understand the intention.  To prevent consumer fraud, such as thieves who might steal items and then attempt to return them for store credit (isn't that why we have receipts?).  But what actually happens is, honest consumers often end up being punished for doing absolutely nothing wrong beyond returning a legitimately defective item.  And since Best Buy doesn't make this "ban" determination, there's absolutely nothing they can do but stare at you blankly and apologize.  I got hit with the "ban hammer" a couple of years ago.  And every time the 90-day ban is lifted, I'm allowed one return and one return only.  If anymore take place, I am then re-banned again for an additional 90 days. It will presumably remain this way for the remainder of my life.  Eventually, I reached a point where I said that I'm done with them.  They obviously see people who return items as dishonest crooks, so why would I continue to give them my business?   Oh, I'll still set foot in Best Buy on occasion.  They'll come in handy when I want to "window shop" and look at items, before purchasing them on my phone via Amazon.  Other than that, they're not really good for much else.  And just like when Ultimate Electronics went under a few years ago, when it happens to Best Buy, I'll say the same thing I've always said:  You - just - don't - get - it.  Sorry, Best Buy.  There are other places that legitimately stand behind their products, without punishing consumer who have to make the occasional return.  I'll be taking my business elsewhere.  Not recommended.

Macayo's has always been kind of a hit or miss with us.  While not everything on their menu is great, you'll probably find something that you'll like if you're willing to experiment a little.  Their chips and salsa are pretty standard.  My favorite dish, however, was a sampler platter that had miniature versions of practically everything (mini chimi, tamales etc).  Much to my dismay, they removed it from the menu several months ago.  Thankfully, the servers assured me that it could still be made quite easily on request.  During our most recent visit, however, things seemed to take a turn for the worse.  I inquired about the combo platter, but was told by the server that they don't have that anymore and would have to order something else.  I went with the significantly less exciting Tour de Macayo, while my girlfriend ordered her usual chicken enchiladas.  By mistake, she received a cheese enchilada instead.  When we politely said something, the server was not apologetic and seemed to "turn off" the hospitality button from that point on.  I hate it when this happens, because you feel you're just supposed to shut up and take what you get.    On the other hand, my "tour" had a pretty decent cheese enchilada and small chimichanga.  However, the rice and beans tasted way off.  Well, actually, the beans didn't taste like anything at all, while the rice possessed that "old grease" aftertaste that just ruins the dish completely.  But after what happened with the cheese enchilada, I decided that it was best just to keep quiet.  Side Note: Macayo's actually makes a very good fried ice cream for dessert, but since our server rushed us off with the bill and didn't bother inquiring about dessert, we went to get ice cream elsewhere.  I'll be honest.  When Macayos is "on," they're usually fairly decent with their service and food.  But if they're not on top of things, the inconsistencies reveal themselves and you wind up leaving rather disappointed.

I started taking my car to this specific Firestone location several years ago. Despite there being several other Firestones closer to my home, I continue going out of my way to the 35th and Bell location for all of my maintenance needs. I have a 2009 Toyota Yaris with almost 200K miles on it and my goal is to get the thing past 300K. During this time, about 95% of the maintenance I've had done in the last six years has been by these people.  One of the things that I hate about many of these auto-maintenance stores, especially the ones at dealerships, is that you can take your car in for a simple 20 dollar oil change, and they'll bring you back a laundry list of items that they try to "scare" you into getting done. If you decline, they start pressuring you, convincing you that your car will break down if you don't buy into their BS. What they fail to realize is that this high-pressure approach is what drives most customers away.  If it's not broke, don't fix it!  Fortunately, they keep that to a minimum at this particular Firestone. While they occasionally give me "recommendations" based on my mileage, such as all those damned flushes and high mileage oil that I've learned is not necessary- they've never pressured me into getting anything that I don't want.  And if they do find something that needs changed/fixed, they always tell me, without making any exaggerations.  I've never had to wait more than a few hours for any work that needs to be done and find the staff to be very honest and professional.    Highly recommended!

Over the last few years, my girlfriend and I have visited Thee Pitts on three separate occasions.  It seems that our opinion of the food gradually decreases after each visit. It's not necessarily that the food is getting worse.  It's simply that, over time, we've had more exposure to good BBQ and have developed higher expectations as a result.  Thee Pitt's is an interesting little place.  The setup seems to kind of be frozen in a "90s diner" type of décor which is painfully outdated.  There are a lot of awards on display.  This place also had some exposure with Guy Fieri a few years back, so you'd assume that they'd really be at the top of the BBQ pedestal in Phoenix, right?  Although I've often jokingly wondered, has Guy ever been to a spot that ended up disappointing him, but fakes it for the sake of the show?  We usually order the pulled pork.  There's sauce at the table, so you have the option to add more (cold) sauce if you'd like.  It's pretty standard stuff, especially in comparison to what you can get at places like Bobby Q's, Naked BBQ, or Pork on a Fork.    I do like their mac and cheese squares, which is merely another term for fried boxed macaroni and cheese.  It reminds me of a comfort bar food I'd eat in my college days.  Their actual mac and cheese though (with bread crumbs) is the polar opposite.  Few BBQ joints seem to know how to do mac and cheese properly and Pitt's is no different.    Their cornbread has always sucked.  We've known this from the very beginning and were warned about it beforehand by other reviewers.  I don't think it's ever tasted fresh - probably because it isn't.  As for the dessert menu, this was my first experience eating a fried twinkie, which we order a la mode.  Although it's not like the concept of deep frying a twinkie requires any culinary skill, it's still a nice little addition for those who enjoy fair-style foods.  One plus is that the service itself has always been decent.  I feel this place has the potential to be so much more than what it actually is.  An average BBQ joint that got very lucky with DDD exposure, which has, in turn, created a lot of new customers who end up leaving just a little confused.  Not recommended.

I often take my little chihuahua to the grooming salon at this location.  It's just a hole in the wall salon, which seems kind of oddly placed.  Strangely enough, their prices are a bit higher than the services I receive at PetSmart.  However, I've found that I get a little bit more consistency with this location with the groomers not trying to cut corners.  The store itself is fine.  I've bought a few items here without any problems.  It doesn't stink as badly as some other stores do.  The VetCo people who come on Fridays are nice, although one time, the doctor didn't show up so they had to send us over to a different location.  We were provided with a discount code for our troubles, so I can't complain.  It's not the best experience you'll have, but it's convenient if anything else.

Traveling to and from high country, I'm sure you've spotted the signs off of Interstate 17.  It was only a matter of time before my girlfriend and I eventually had to stop and pay Rock Springs Café a visit.  And if you're familiar with roadside diner/dive restaurant, you probably have a general idea of where to keep your expectations.  And those expectations should be kept as low as possible.  Rock Springs was extremely crowded for a Sunday afternoon, which I think was largely impacted by the eight mile back-up from a vehicle fire that occurred on I-17.  We were seated in about 30 minutes in a dining/bar room that reminds me of where truck drivers probably stopped off to engage in random arm wrestling matches in the 1980s.  I ordered a Diet Pepsi and received an extremely flat root beer instead. Once I made the error known, I promptly received my Diet Pepsi.  It was equally as flat, while also having that offensive aftertaste that is only found in rural tap water.  Clearly, something is going on with their beverages and I'm not entirely sure I want to go back there and find out why.  I surrendered at being able to obtain a good soda, so I just requested a cup of water.  Unfortunately, the water, which was obviously from the tap, also exhibited the dreaded "pennies" aftertaste.  There's only so many times you can say something without getting embarrassed, so I just decided to not drink anything with my meal.  My girlfriend, on the other hand, ordered lukewarm coffee, which couldn't have been anymore bland and damn-near impossible to get a refill on.  I ordered a burger while my girlfriend opted for the honey fried chicken. My burger was pretty standard and the equivalent of what you'd probably get at any roadside diner, with the fries being the same. My girlfriend received a salad, which I quickly dismissed after a couple of bites.  Additionally, the honey fried chicken, which I'm pretty sure had absolutely no honey in its flavor whatsoever, was completely tasteless.    When Yelp reviews said do not come here for the food, they definitely weren't lying!  While they aggressively advertise their pie as being "world famous," the food is something that can easily be skipped.    Hoping the pie would help redeem their rating, I ordered a slice of coconut cream while my girlfriend ordered apple.  However, she made the fatal mistake of not getting hers heated up.  But after returning with the leftovers later that evening and nuking the remaining apple, I'm not sure if it would have made much of a difference.  The pies were average at best and not really something that I'd insist on having shipped to me on a regular basis in Phoenix.  It's not so much that the pies here are amazing, it's more due to the fact that they're the ONLY place that serves pie in a 40 mile radius, so you really have nothing else to compare it against.  I wish I had something good to say about this place, but I'm really struggling.  The food was bland, the pie was overrated, and the service was extremely slow to the point where it took forever for us to receive our check.  Disappointments throughout.  To top it off, the restrooms were at the level of what you'd expect inside a gas station in the middle of the ghetto.  If you're the type that just likes wolfing down food for the sole sake of stuffing yourself, then maybe you'll enjoy it.  Due to its location, I'm sure this place receives constant business.  Why change things if customers are always coming in?  My suggestion is to just tough it out.  Stop off in Sedona or Flag and fill your bellies there.    Not recommended!

I've used Larry Miller Collision several times over the years and, unlike many of the reviewers, I've never really had a problem with them.  The only issue I've found lies within their lack of communication and slow turn-around time.  Since I intentionally pay higher insurance to have a cheap deductible, as well as rental coverage, the fact that my car may take two or three weeks has never really been a financial burden.  But for those people who do not have this type of coverage and are without a vehicle, I'd imagine the experience can be quite frustrating.  I first took my car in after some "bro" backed into me at a stop light in his oversized "douche truck," completely destroying the front bumper of my little Toyota Yaris.  I received my rental and everything was fixed within two weeks.  This was probably the best handled of all of my experiences, receiving regular updates on the status of my car, as well as the employee in charge thoroughly explaining the entire procedure.  My second experience was after my door was smashed in during a hit-and-run in the crime-riddled Wal-Mart parking lot, which resulted in an equally smooth experience.  My third visit was due to a replacement of shattered fog lights, which was a pretty quick fix that didn't take longer than a week.  My fourth and most recent visit, involved them having to perform extensive work after running over a tire coming down the I-17 from Flagstaff.  This time, the work took about three weeks.  During this time, the only time I'd receive an update is if I called them myself and asked to speak to the employee who was handling my case.  But once again, everything was fixed without issue.  The fact that they have an Enterprise connected to the shop makes things fairly convenient.  The lady who runs the booth has always been polite and tries best to accommodate my preference for a smaller vehicle.  While I can't say there's anything special about their procedures or their treatment, I've never really noticed anything particular bad about this body shop.  The next time someone hits my Yaris (which they inevitably will), I'll most likely continue taking it here.

To some people, myself included, the concept of chicken and waffles originally sounded absolutely ludicrous. Then you try it and immediately realize that you still have much to learn in life.  I've always been a big fan of LoLo's for many reasons.  First, above all else, their fried chicken is top notch in terms of quality and consistency. In fact, their fried chicken is so good, that it beats out a handful of more upscale joints that shamefully charge more money for an inferior product. Make no mistake, Lolo's does chicken extremely well!  The waffles, on the other hand, are just okay.  I'd describe them as soft and flimsy, with a slight cinnamon flavor to them.  They're not quite as good as some of the waffles offered at local breakfast joints, but I suppose they're passable.  I've tried several sides over the last few years, including grits, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese.  All are pretty well done and reasonably priced.  Their menu, featuring various ghetto call-outs, is quite amusing, even though I'll probably never try most of the stuff myself.  Their cornbread used to be my favorite of all the sides.  It's still very good, but they recently changed the recipe that now includes actual corn kernels inside.  This is a matter of personal preference, but I much prefer the old way.  I insist on ordering Kool Aid.   Perfect for an intense sugar high, it's the same classic stuff that will permanently stain your clothes and temporarily dye your upper lip - just like the old days!    We've always wanted to try the desserts here, but we're just so damned full after our meals, that we couldn't possibly order anything else.    While not everything on the menu is flawless, it's good quality and it's cheap.   I have very little to complain about and for that, I give it a strong recommendation!

I first read about Vito's after they popped up on a list of "Best Pizza" options in Phoenix a few years ago.  It seemed odd, as most places on this list were far more popular and well known, while Vito's is more of a hole-in-the-wall location that I'd imagine I'd probably overlook under most circumstances.  I haven't explored their entire menu, but I'm quite familiar with their deep dish pizza.  In my opinion, it's far superior to what you'd get at the ever so popular Oregano's in terms of its flavor and quality.  Then again, I'm no deep dish snob - and with Lou Milnati's opening up soon in Phoenix, my opinion of what constitutes good deep dish pizza might drastically change, forcing me to update this review in the future.  For the time being, however, I give them a high recommendation!

I'm not sure whether or not they changed their policy, but the first (and only) time I ordered food at this location, the cashier warned me that they would be slapping a service fee onto my bill because I was paying with a debit card.  What year is this again?  If this were some small mom and pop outfit, I wouldn't be surprised, but I've never seen a national chain pull this stunt.  In fact, I'm not even sure if they're allowed to - until I realized it's most likely the result of a very stingy franchisee who's attempting to maximize his or her profit.  Of course, what they don't realize is that by doing this, all it does is anger patrons to the point where you ultimately end up losing more business than you bring in. Especially when you can just drive down the road and give your debit card to another location without them so much as batting an eye.   I haven't been back and will never be back.  Based on the god-awful reviews, it looks like I'm not missing out on much.

If I judged restaurants on ambiance alone, and I feel that many people do, I'd probably consider Cibo to be the best in the city.  Although the ultra-trendy bungalow setup has now become somewhat of a hipster cliché in downtown Phoenix, I'm pretty sure Cibo was there long before the downtown scene started picking up.  Locals seem to flock here for their pizza and wine fixes.  Based on the conversations I've overheard while eating, it's clear that Cibo not only serves as an ideal first-date place, but a somewhat secretive hideaway for middle-aged couples having mid-life marital affairs (I've witnessed both first-hand at nearby tables).  Cibo offers up a fairly decent pizza.  One thing I do like, is that they'll gladly let you do half-and-half pies.  Most of these Neapolitan places arrogantly scoff at the mere mention of the idea.  In fact, they even let you combine a white pizza with a red one, which is very rare, but incredibly convenient given all of their different choices.  While I give Cibo credit for offering some interesting creations, is it really necessary to have 22 different pizzas (sans the calzones) on the menu? Oddly enough, despite all of these ridiculous options that give me anxiety at first glance, their best pizza is a pretty standard-fare margherita.  Their calzone, which is rather alarming at first, due to its massive size, is also good.  Although I hate admitting that I am partial to the ones served at Pomo Pizzeria.  Their burrata appetizer was all right, but not something I'd probably order again.  We've also tried their linguine pasta, which I liked, but for all the wrong reasons.  It reminded me of Kraft mac and cheese (one of my guilty pleasures), which I'm pretty sure was not their intention.    The banana and nutella crepe with a scoop of ice cream has never disappointed and is one of the few things that I feel they've got down to a science.    Their canned sodas seems like kind of an odd choice, especially considering most pizzerias opt for the glass bottle selection.  It seems rather ghetto in comparison to everything else on the menu.  Not everyone drinks wine, you know?    I feel that it's worth an occasional visit, but will probably never be at the top of my list of places to regularly frequent.  I guess that just makes me tragically unhip, but I'd much rather enjoy the limited, but yet exceptional pie options from Bianco or Il Bosco,  I guess sometimes, simplicity wins in the end.  But I still feel it's a good place to visit every now and again.

All crappy restaurant owners should take note.  Bobby Q's is basically a textbook example of how to successfully run a restaurant properly.      Bobby's claims it was voted the Best BBQ in the US, although I'm not sure of their source? Nevertheless, I'd have a hard time arguing, as it definitely sets the bar extremely high. We've been here several times and have never had a bad meal. In fact, virtually everything we've tried on the menu seems to be done correctly.   The pulled pork, which is my preferred way to eat BBQ, always manages to impress me with its flavor.  For sides, I've had the mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese, which is far superior to that low-grade sludge they try to get away with dishing out at all of these other places in Phoenix. Even their fries are better than you'd expect.  The place is decorated to the point where, if I didn't know any better, I would have wrongfully assumed it was a chain restaurant. But yet, I like that, despite their popularity, they haven't decided to branch out and open up 20 different locations all over the city (and I actually hope they never do for quality and consistency purposes).  I've always wondered if their steaks are equally as good as their BBQ, but I've never wanted to sacrifice the taste of a great pulled pork sandwich in order to find out. And we're always so full after our meals that we've never been able to try some of their desserts. Based on their Yelp pictures, it seems like many people are in the same boat.  But, like all business owners should know, it's the little things that go a long way. The complimentary cornbread you receive before your meal is both unique, yet extremely well done. Oh, and that's not all. On your way out, you also get treated to a little bag of their homemade donuts, which you can often spot being made whenever you first walk in. I've said many times that it's little touches like that keep customers coming back - and it most definitely works. It's not rocket science and I'm amazed that other restaurants have failed to adopt this well-received approach.  Easily the best BBQ experience in all of Phoenix and a great all-around business!

Le Grande Orange is incredibly popular amongst the locals - and deservedly so.   I rank their food right up there with some of the best in The Valley!  Unlike most places these days that use the ever-so-popular brick/wood-fired approach, LGO opts to bake their pies in the more traditional pizza open.  Their ingredients are high quality and their sourdough crust is a lovely touch.  Oddly enough, my favorite creation isn't even on the menu anymore, but can still be ordered on request.  The roasted corn and traditional margherita are also some of my favorites.  It's not all about pizza at LGO.  Although I would never expect it, their cheeseburger is quite possibly the best that I've found in my search, exceeding even the LGO Ingo offerings that can be found next door. Request to have it served on one of their English muffins and you won't regret it.  Lots of ingredients, including some shredded cheese, which works much better than you would assume.  Desserts are kind of hit and miss.  I'm not a big fan of their red velvet or the old timer, which seems much too hard-textured to match the classic Hostess cupcake it's obviously attempting to improve upon.  It's their sea salt cookie, topped with a scoop of gelato that has become the default request whenever we visit.  Note that their bakery also serves a variety of other items as well, including a variety of knick-knacks that seem to mostly be gift-related items.  LGO also serves breakfast.  We've only visited once and while it was good, I didn't really like the setup.  You order at the counter and then stand around waiting for it to be served, before going to find a seat yourself.  For the post-hike Sunday morning crowd, it seemed like a popular brunch spot to enjoy some coffee and eggs, while lounging around in active wear and yoga pants. Good food, but not really my scene.  The place can get loud at times, especially the bar area.  But overall, it's a good dining experience.  A nice atmosphere with a mixture of customers that isn't overkill on the hipster vibe.  It is, was, and will always be one of my favorite places for dinner!

We made reservations at Binkley's for my 33rd birthday way back in March.  This was a completely new and somewhat intimidating experience, so I heavily researched online for some direction about what to order. Most people said that a couple of 4-course meals would be more than enough food to satisfy us both, so that's what we opted for.  We were seated in a quiet little room away from the crowd, which was nice and semi-secluded.  I say semi, as I constantly had to tune out the nearby couple that were in the early stages of dating.  Despite this, I really liked their setup and atmosphere.   All of the servers were very polite.  Virtually everything that was brought out to us was described in great detail.  I regret not having them write everything down for future reference.  Stand-outs include the mini-sloppy joes, the siphon filtered tea, mango bombs, and some excellent buttered bread.  I kept my birthday menu, but since the amuse-bouches were not listed, we can only go off of pictures. Regardless, all of them were very good. We tried so many things, that I don't feel there's any point in attempting to describe them all.    Oddly enough, my only complaint is that neither one of us were full at the end of our meal.  We devoured everything and had absolutely nothing left to take home (which is very rare).  So, while the food may be good, don't expect anything generous in terms of portions.  I now feel we could have easily gotten away with a 5 or 6 course meal.  I'll remember this if we ever return.  There was a mistake with our bill, which I luckily caught.  As you know, mistakes at these restaurants are usually more than just a couple of pennies, so I'm glad I took the time to look.  I'd recommend it for special occasions.  It's definitely a nice experience, but with so many other upscale places on our list to eventually try, it'll probably be a few years before doing a repeat.

I used this company to help move a pinball machine upstairs, as every billiard or slot machine store I called were either too busy, too disorganized, or just had minimal interest in helping me.    I called and received a quote, with a time given that they would arrive. Keep in mind, this was not a 4-5 hour time window that would require me to take an entire day off of work.  It was an exact time, making my life much, much easier.  They used a crew of three movers, who were extremely careful every step of the way.  They even helped me with setup, which they weren't really required to do.    I'm not moving anytime soon, but I'd definitely use them again in the future for some heavy duty help!

I've been using Cox ever since I first moved to Phoenix back in the late summer of 2007.  I was one of the earlier "cord cutters" that quickly realized that I was wasting money shelling out a monthly fee for a ridiculous number of channels, the majority of which, I never actually watched.  I haven't looked back since.  Unfortunately, I still rely on Cox for my Internet, since options are so limited in Phoenix.  Honestly, I've never actually been able to get the speeds that I'm paying for.  I accepted long ago that they rip us off in this regard. But it's their corporate greed that I've always had a bigger issue with.  I often use "cable companying" as a verb to describe any business that lures customers in with reasonable deals, while gradually upping the price every year, hoping that we'll just shut up and accept it as a "cost of living" increase.  Their pricing seems to be more aggressive in recent years.  Since many people are abandoning land lines and cable TV, Cox is attempting to recoup the loss by squeezing as much money as they can out of their Internet plans.  It will eventually become their bread and butter, as they're fully aware that it's the one thing that people can't live without.    As for the customer service agents, it tends to vary.  You might get lucky, but 30-60 minute hold times are pretty standard.  I've had better luck with banks, which is quite sad.  The last time I had to deal with one, he was mumbling through instructions while simultaneously eating what sounded like a bag of chips.  Eventually, we got disconnected and since he made no effort to call me back, I just gave up.  Prepare to set aside a two hour window if you ever have Internet issues that need to be addressed.  One of the other things that always aggravates me about Cox is that, when they raise your price, if you call them to complain, they often provide you with a better "deal".  This partially makes you happy, but also makes you realize that you've essentially been overpaying for the last 12-24 months.  Why don't they just offer you the lowest price possible to begin with?  It's a very shady tactic that kind of exposes just how dishonest these cable companies can truly be.  During my most recent experience, I was going through the annual process of complaining about my ridiculous price increase.  As usual, they offered me a deal, which made me realize that, once again, I've been overpaying. Only problem was, they never actually applied the promotion. I had to call back to ask why, only for them to discover that the promotion that I was promised, cannot be applied to my account.  Initially, they said that they could honor what I was originally quoted, since that would obviously be the "honest" thing to do, but this is a cable company we're talking about here.  I was given another quote, which, as usual, was more expensive than what was originally offered.  Ugh!    I wish this city would get with the program and just implement a municipal Wi Fi Network, so these damned cable companies will just go away.  Of course, I'm sure Cox will do everything in their power to ensure that this NEVER happens - but one can always hold out hope.

Seriously, people?  Maybe if your only comparisons are McDonald's and Burger King, you might think Freddy's is in a league of its own.  But if you've actually eaten at some of the far superior fast food chains like In-N-Out or The Habit Burger Grill, you'll probably be disappointed with what they offer here.  My girlfriend and I have eaten at Freddy's several times over the years. Each time, our opinion drops considerably.  First of all, if you're going to get a steakburger, ordering a single patty just isn't logical.  You must order a double.  The reason, is because they smash their patties so flat that the meat is void of any juice or flavor.  It's just an ultra-thin slice of what I'm assuming was actual meat at one point.    The French fries, with the addition of their sauce, are admittedly not too bad.  However, they are very thin, which is very similar to what you'll get at the similar Steak 'n Shake chain that is more commonly found in the Midwest.    Their frozen custard is a complete disgrace.  I've ordered turtle sundaes on two occasions.  Both times, the custard was so runny and milky that I would have been better off drinking it with a straw.  If you've ever been to Culver's, you'll know that frozen custard is supposed to be creamy and dare I say, not much different than traditional ice cream.  Prices are too high for what they're giving you.  Strangely enough, they seem to have quite a few fans, as the place was jam packed with the post-church crowd on a Sunday afternoon to the point where I was somewhat disturbed.  Clearly they see something that I don't.  Trust me.  If you want a fast food level burger, there are far, far better options available in this city.  That is, if you're willing to venture outside of the bubble that is Bell Road.    Not recommended.

Naturally, there's always been somewhat of a backlash against Sprinkles in a similar manner to Starbucks. The company has successfully developed a "brand" that somehow gets away with charging high prices for a product that they pass off as "premium" grade. Admittedly, because of this reason, I should automatically dislike them by default. But once you've bitten into one of their Red Velvets, it's kind of hard NOT to like them.    I would like to say that there's some locally owned shop that makes cupcakes that are vastly superior to what you can get at Sprinkles. You know, the usual, "pat yourself on the back" for supporting the local economy and promoting some hole-in-the-wall bakery and turn your nose up to the chain kind of place. Unfortunately, if such place exists in Phoenix, we've yet to find it.  What I like about Sprinkles is that they have their flavors are in constant rotation. So with the exception of their more popular choices (i.e. Red Velvet, Vanilla Milk Chocolate, Black and White), some flavors are only available on specific days.  Additionally, they have seasonal cupcakes that are only available during specific times of the year.    I can't say that every cupcake they have is umm..."delish," or whatever it is the kids say these days. But this is largely due to personal taste rather than a lack of quality. Their Green Tea Lavender, for example, might be good - but only if you like the taste of hand lotion.  And their tribute to Elvis, aptly named "The King" ended up being a letdown. But that doesn't mean there aren't some hidden gems to be found if you're willing to experiment.   They sometimes do online contests that let people send in ideas for new cupcake creations, but I've noticed that they always make sure their "winners" are always within the usual realm of restricted flavors/ingredients. In other words, don't ever expect them to ever use an "outside source" for frosting (i.e. Nutella) or to try anything dramatic beyond adding bacon, which is kind of a clichéd ingredient these days.  The cupcake ATM is a neat addition if you have a late-night sugar craving, but please be aware that they do sneak in a convenience charge to your bill for using it.  People are always friendly and their cupcakes are always great quality. Sprinkles also has excellent ice cream, which I'm hoping they'll eventually tack on to this Fashion Square location sometime in the future.  Always a favorite place to visit!

I used Express Solar Protection based on all of the great Yelp reviews. I reached out to Kevin and explained to him that I wanted solar screens installed on every single window of my house. He explained my options, quoted me, provided some aesthetic advice, and did a wonderful job with the installation of the screens.    He even cleaned the windows before installing the screens at my request.  Unfortunately, I developed ongoing issues with a screen door that we also replaced. Kevin came out to fix the issue shortly after I contacted him. He also came out a few months down the road to take care of some other minor problems I was having. It took him awhile to get back to me, but he still came out and took care of me in the end.  A good choice if you're in the market for some solar screens.

We've paid numerous visits to La Piazza al Forno and have always been satisfied with the quality of their pizza. Their Regina Margherita D.O.C., Salvatore, and Dolce Diavolo are all excellent pies, with high quality ingredients and a nice, charred and bubbly crust that's full of flavor.    Their appetizers, including their fried meatballs and ravioli are also worth mentioning.  I also like that they offer the giant coke (medio litro) bottles in contrast to the standard-sized ones that most places have.  The place seems to be very popular for the area and service has always been good.  So, why not a perfect five stars, you ask?  There's massive inconsistency with their bread policy.  We always like to start off with some house made bread and olive oil as an appetizer.  They have it and it's actually very good.  Although whether or not they let you have it seems to vary based on the server.  One server refused, claiming it was only for people who ordered pasta. So, even though we're ordering multiple pizzas, we're not allowed to have any bread beforehand? Interestingly enough, another server gave us some without any fuss.  On another visit, the server refused due to the pasta-only policy, but then was kind enough to smuggle some out to it after she felt bad.  Personally, since we're paying for the bread, I don't see why this would ever be an issue.  The only other gripe is that their housemade dessert menu isn't really all that impressive.  They need that "killer dish" that everyone recommends, but I've yet to discover it.  Strangely enough, their sister restaurant (La Piazza Phx) offers a dessert menu that features an absolutely amazing Angioletti Con Nutella that I wish they'd considering adding to their Glendale menu.  These gripes aside, I still highly recommend their pizza!

Upscale dining in West Valley has always been somewhat sparse. Based on the business that Arrowhead Grill gets, there's definitely a demand for it.  The first time we paid a visit, I actually wasn't sure what to expect. Fortunately, the food at Arrowhead Grill is superb and well worth the price you pay. The menu is pretty straightforward. All dishes are purchased a la carte, so you'll typically want to order your entrées with a couple of sides. They offer some decent salads as starters, although I haven't yet sampled all of their appetizers. I did have an opportunity to try the Lamb Chop Fondue and Pig Wings, which definitely didn't disappoint. As for entrees, my favorite is their Delmonico, which is what I usually end up ordering. Their bacon-wrapped filet is also worth mentioning. One day, I hope to be adventurous and try some of their other steaks.  For sides, you have many options and most are more than enough to feed two people. I highly recommend their AG Mashed Potatoes and Artisan Mac and Cheese.  The AG Mashed Potatoes are, in fact, so good, that we've refused restrictive three-course specials based solely on the fact that they don't offer them (and won't substitute them in despite offering to pay extra).  One of my favorite things about AG is their Thanksgiving offering. On Thanksgiving Day, you can make reservations for a traditional holiday dinner. We went last year and had turkey and turducken, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and the whole works. As long as they continue offering this, we'll continue going.  As for their desserts, the Butter Cake is our absolute favorite!  In fact, going to their dessert menu and ordering anything else EXCEPT the Butter Cake is doing your party a huge dining disservice.  Yes, it's actually that good!  Based on my observations, very rarely do people order anything else.  We did have one ugly hiccup once during a Valentine's Day dinner where everyone seemed to be off their game.  While most people were ordering the smaller 4.99 version of the cake, we opted for the full-priced (bigger) one.  It was so blatantly obvious that it was not fresh, as it was cold and very dry.  I'm not sure if it's because they had them in storage or if it's because they were so close to closing time.  This cheap little trick was enough for me to dock them from a perfect five star rating.  Another frustration is that whenever they do their little 3-4 course menus, they sometimes offer flexibility with the sides, allowing you to order sides that aren't listed as options.  Other times, they'll let you upgrade for an extra price.  Or, on one occasion, they flat out refused to let us make any modifications whatsoever.  I'm all for rules, but rules are worthless if they aren't consistent.    Additionally, they seem to have varying ideas of what a "medium well" steak should be cooked like depending on who's running the kitchen.  My advice is to order your meat a step lower than what you would usually get, and then just have them place it back on the grill if necessary.    Reservations are recommended on the weekends for sure. It can be pricey (I'm sure made much worse if you drink alcohol). If you join their e-mail list, you'll receive the occasional discount offers and information about their specials, which are often times pretty good deals.  The restaurant can often be crowded, but has never once reached a point where I've found it loud and distracting. Service has always been good and the food has never disappointed.

Compared to some of the incredible local pizzerias we have in Phoenix, Grimaldi's doesn't even come close to showing off the potential of what good pizza can truly be.  But, at the same time, in terms of chain pizza, I've found that Grimaldi's is one of the better options.  I largely attribute this to their crust.  Coal-brick does indeed give their crust a great flavor that you won't find at most places.  Emphasizing this is very smart marketing on their part.  I'm not really a fan of "build your own" concepts and prefer places that have developed their own creations that you can experience by choice. Unfortunately, aside from a few rare exceptions, you're pretty much on your own at Grimaldi's.  Be careful, because if you're the type who likes to dump a lot of crap onto your pizzas, your bill will quickly add up.  I've jokingly said that someone should order every topping and create an 86 dollar large pizza just to see how god-awful it would truly be.  Although I've found that keeping it simple with a basic pepperoni is all that's necessary.  Service is okay, but I always seem to recollect the time when I went here with a co-worker a few years ago.  I asked the server what he would recommend for my pizza.  He just looked at me like I asked him to recite all 44 U.S. presidents in chronological order.  He had nothing!  No suggestions and no guidance!  He eventually shrugged and reluctantly stated, "The chicken is pretty good, I guess..."  Seriously?      We had a terrible experience in Chandler, but that's a different story for a different day.    I'll gladly give them four stars under the category of "chain pizza" - so if that's your thing, you should be very pleased what they have to offer.

The reviews you see are accurate. I used these guys to paint the exterior of my house. The owner came out and provided me with options while explaining the process in great detail. I could immediately tell that this place runs like a well-oiled machine. I was placed on the schedule, while receiving weekly updates about any possible changes. I ended up having my exterior painted several weeks earlier than originally scheduled due to some changes, which was fine by me.   The crew, which is an actual crew of employees rather than short-term fillers, was timely, professional, and did a great job on my house. Most importantly, their communication was quick. I had some questions/concerns about paint colors. I received e-mail responses long past regular business hours and the supervisor was out there the very next day to address all of my questions.  I had a brief panic several months after my painting project was finished when I noticed these tiny little chipping areas on one side of my house.  Once again, I e-mailed them and received a response outside of normal hours.  I had someone out there within 48 hours to resolve the issue, which they believe was the result of a hail storm.   I'd gladly use them again years down the road. I just wish they did interior work as well.  There are so many painting companies in Phoenix that know how to paint - but don't understand the business/customer support aspect of the service they are providing.  This is a company that does!

Growing up in the rural Midwest, there are some places that you just regularly visit just out of habit.  For me, Wal-Mart will always be that place.  As far as Wal-Marts go, you can do much, much worse than this particular location.  I'm embarrassed to admit that I've visited enough Wal-Mart locations in this city that I can actually make some pretty detailed comparisons on how they all stack up against each other.    This particular spot seems cleaner and less populated than nearby locations, which I largely attribute to the fact that it's in a fairly new neighborhood that has minimal surrounding businesses.  There's another location, just off of Bell on 83rd Avenue, which seems to attract more customers due to being in a much busier area of town. Therefore, this location, which is a little further north, seems to quietly fly under the radar. I hope it continues to stay this way for awhile.  It's pretty clean and I've had no issues with customer service.  They're pretty well stocked with all of the essentials.      Interestingly enough, the Wal-Mart in Norterra off of I-17 is actually a little closer to where I live, but I've found that particular store to be an absolute madhouse during peak hours.  I'll continue driving a little further out of my way to have a better shopping experience over on Lake Pleasant.

An extremely well run business! I originally used American Home Water and Air in the summer of 2014 in order to have a soft water filtration unit and reverse osmosis installed in my house.   One of the owners came out, explained my options, made his recommendations based on my needs, and provided me with a very good quote. Several hours later, a crew of two gentlemen were at my house installing both units. Instructions were provided, clean up was quick, and the whole process couldn't have been easier. I had a few operational questions, which were promptly answered when I called the phone number provided.  A nice change in comparison to those local businesses that pretend you no longer exist once they've made a sale.  I required their services again one year later.  I needed to have my soft water filtration system temporarily moved/uninstalled and then reinstalled three days later due to a garage epoxy project I was having done by another company. I called and asked for a quote. The lady said she'd get back to me in a couple of hours, which she actually did. In fact, practically every time I've called them during business hours, someone actually ANSWERS the phone.   I use them once a year for my RO filter change.  I am confident that if I need help with issues down the road that they'll be there to assist.  Highly recommended.

This was the first (and only) apartment complex I ever lived in when I first moved to Phoenix back in 2007.  Back then, the community was owned by Mark Taylor and had just recently opened.  In fact, I was the very first tenant assigned to my unit.  As for my apartment dwellings itself, I was always satisfied since I only wanted a small, one-bedroom and one bathroom unit.  I was up on third floor with a nice little balcony that still allowed me to have a good degree of privacy.  In some ways, I kind of miss the simplicity of it all.    The maintenance man, at least back then, was really nice and always willing to help me if I had any issues, which was rarely.    The office girls, however, were incredibly snooty.  I'll never forget my first day, politely asking how I work the laser key to open up the gates while she snickered under her breath at my apparent ignorance.  Sorry, lady. I'm from rural Indiana.  We don't put gates around our communities.  They wouldn't let me pay my rent with my debit card, so I was forced to go across the street and get a cashier's check at the bank every month.  I also had a horrible time getting access to a lot of my packages because my work hours often conflicted with the hours of the office. Some guy who worked in the office ended up taking my friend's cell number from her file so he could start texting her, which is about as creepy as things can get.  I wrongfully assumed I'd be living amongst young professionals, but it seemed to be more populated with rowdy kids whose sources of income always remained a mystery to me.  One guy, who lived two floors below me, had seemingly nothing better to do than thump his rap music all day and night and shake the entire building.    Many people who lived here didn't have vehicles, so they would often transport their groceries in (stolen) shopping carts that they would then leave littered around the community.  It got so bad that, at one point, the manager at the Albertson's across the street called to complain.  They eventually had to implement a "fine" to anyone who was caught with a shopping cart within the community.  There was a guy on the first floor, whose girlfriend would make so much noise when they were having sex, that I didn't know whether to call in a noise disturbance or ask him for some "bedroom tips" that I could use in the future.  The halls would often be littered with trash that would rarely get picked up.  It was not uncommon to see beer bottles, spilled pasta, and disgusting cigarette butts just several feet from my door mat.  I eventually had to start cleaning it up myself, since clearly no one else was going to do the job.  They somehow criss-crossed the APS billing of my friend's apartment with her neighbor, so she ended up paying almost triple in utilities what she should have been paying.  I had a shaded parking area and frequently had to have people towed out of my space.  One morning, I found a pair of soaked briefs on top of my car, which I begrudgingly had to remove myself.  The office staff found this funnier than I did.  Maybe I just don't have a sense of humor, I guess.  I left after two years when I decided to buy a house.  Looking back on it, the overall experience was pretty poor and I don't feel it's a place that I'd ever recommend to anyone.

*In regards to owner's comment at the end of this review: I most certainly do NOT have the wrong company!  I met Robert, son-in-law Scott, and the main owner (Bob).*  ==  I used this company to do a full interior job a couple of summers ago, with the intention of basically having every square inch of my house repainted. I was given a quote, instructed to remove everything from the walls that I could, made my color choices and was all set for them to come paint.  I was extremely specific with my instructions. My painting project wasn't very complex. I only had two colors, but I wanted to make sure that it was done properly. One of the risks of having your entire house painted is that it's often more prone to shortcuts, as opposed to a single bedroom, which would receive more attention to detail. I wanted to make sure that no corners were cut during the process, which I was assured that there would not be.  The power in my house was basically shut down at their request, so I stayed somewhere else while they were working. This was a mistake, as I should have been there to monitor. The whole process took about three days, as the first day was dedicated entirely to prepping the house. The second day and half of the third day were dedicated to the painting itself. When the crew finished and I came to do the "final" inspection, I was very surprised to discover that the job wasn't even close to completed  The garage was totally neglected and the insides of the closets and pantry were done incorrectly. So much for my specific instructions. I guess there was some miscommunication between the crew and the supervisor.  After assuring me that they would be back out to finish the job sometime the following week, I was then asked to provide them with the remaining balance, which I obviously did NOT provide since the job was only 75% complete.  Upon closer inspection, I saw a lot of inconsistencies in the work. With a crew of a few guys, some rooms looked great while others looked completely half-assed. Some switch plates were removed, while it was blatantly obvious that others were just simply painted around out of sheer laziness. Seriously?  The supervisor got very defensive when I told him about this, claiming the crew only paints around cable outlets but always removes regular outlet plates and switches.  Apparently, someone on the crew forgot this rule, I guess?  Multiple nooks and crannies were disregarded, which were mostly attributed to carelessness. An area behind my washer was completely ignored. I created a punch-list of work that needed to be fixed that ended up being so big that I was actually embarrassed.  Getting them to come back out and finish the job was a real hassle. I was told they would be coming out on a specific day, only to have them never show up.  I was then given a vague timeframe of "sometime next week," with no solid commitment being made. It wasn't until I decided to stop being polite and stated that I would not be paying the remaining balance that I suddenly got their attention and had the crew back out within a couple of days in order to finish the job.  The second time around, the actual owner came out to discuss the remaining work with me. This time, they made sure I actually signed a "contract," since they apparently forgot the first time. I use that term in quotations, since it was basically just a quick hand-written description of the work and remaining amount of money owed. Nevertheless, the owner was pretty easy to deal with and made sure that the crew completed everything that I had requested.  They deserve at least an extra star for making sure I was taken care of in the end.   Painting businesses are tricky, because the quality of the work depends largely on the people who are doing the painting. Some are great and some are not. But due to their negligence in following my instructions and inconsistent communication, I would not recommend using them for any big projects.

I've been coming here for the last couple of years in an attempt to, well . . .  not necessarily look younger, but more to ensure that I age gracefully.  I go here for Botox, while I've also experimented with some chemical peels, laser genesis, and minor treatment for some age bumps.    I've had the opportunity to meet Dr. Maltais a few times to discuss specific concerns. She provided me with advice and offered me the least intrusive options possible.  Cost, recovery time, and post-treatment were all well explained. Even when she isn't available, the other ladies are knowledgeable enough to be able to answer any questions you might have.    My only complaint is that I wish the doctor were more accessible.  During my first few visits, she had no problem popping in if I had a question about possible solutions to a concern.  But now, I believe she only does treatments.  Sometimes you just want the opinion of a doctor.  One thing that I really like is that they stay open late on certain days, which makes it much easier for people who work late hours to still be able to come in.  It's so much more convenient than most facilities that force you to rearrange your entire schedule just to accommodate appointments.  They also offer a variety of specials and packages that allow you the opportunity to save money.  Overall, I see them as a a good place to seek out if you're in need of some skin maintenance.

After moving to the West Valley, I started going to Arrowhead Health regularly around 2009.  Previously, I've always found this place to be incredibly convenient.  They have virtually everything on-site.   Plus, if I'm sick or in need of medication, I can usually get in for an appointment and see someone fairly quickly.  The disadvantage of this, however, is that it makes it very hard to find someone to call your personal physician. Obsessed with consistency, I've always tried very hard to deal with one doctor and one doctor only. Unfortunately, when you're sick and they're unavailable, you're desperately stuck just seeing whoever has an opening.  This can be annoying, since all doctors have their own little opinions, demeanor, and theories about what's bad and what's good for treatment.  Every visit feels like I'm going to a new doctor's office.  Every time we get to my insomnia and anxiety issues, I'm told something completely different.  Allergies are equally as frustrating.  For example, I use an inhaler for a whopping four weeks out of the year due to seasonal allergies in Arizona.  A personal physician, well informed of my medical history, would be well aware that this an ongoing issue that will never go away as long as I live in Arizona.  Therefore, getting the prescription refilled is a no brainer.  But here, since I only need the medicine once a year, I always have to go in and basically pay them money to simply say:  Me: "Hey, I need a refill on this because it's allergy season."  Doctor: "Okay."  Wow.  So I took time off work and dished out a co-pay for that?!  A waste of time, a waste of money, and something that easily could have been accomplished over the phone.  This is what ultimately made me decide that I'd be much better off going to a single-physician practice, convenience be damned!  Plus, they don't seem to be as convenient as I originally assumed. Several weeks ago, I felt absolutely horrid, so I wanted to make an appointment in order to talk to - well, whatever random doctor could see me.  Unfortunately, they were all booked up for the next six days (if you count Sunday).  So, I guess you need to book the appointments BEFORE you actually get sick?    Honestly, I've never really had a problem with the physicians or the staff themselves.  They're all very professional and have always answered all of my questions, so it's not as if they're this horrible establishment that needs to be shut down.  I just feel that if you're the type who wants to be under the care of one medical provider in order to build that patient-doctor relationship, this probably isn't the place to do that at.

This Wal-mart was a rather odd concept the first time I spotted it. Remember those old Wal-mart stores that primarily focused on home products with only a tiny section for (mostly dry) groceries?  This is essentially a reverse concept.  It's a Wal-mart that focuses on groceries, while eliminating the majority of the home items.  This location seems to often get overlooked due to the Fry's across the street, which can get irritatingly crowded on some days.  This Wal-mart is pretty quiet, mostly clean, and has often saved me the hassle of going to the bigger store if I only need a few items.  The only cons I've found is that they aren't very good about restocking items.  Additionally, if you have returns for items that they don't sell at this Wal-mart, they usually refuse - which makes absolutely no sense since they're all the same business.  Hey, it still beats fighting through a crowd!

When I first moved into the area, this place was called 2.25 Cleaners, before they inevitably changed their name/price to 2.50 Cleaners. Hopefully, the business expense of replacing a number outside the store is pricey enough that they won't become "2.75 Cleaners" for a few more years.  Unlike some people, I've never really had a problem here.  I take all of my dress slacks and sweaters in bulk. Sometimes, they're insanely wrinkly from sitting in a hamper all summer, but they always come back looking good.  The price is cheap, the service is quick, and they're friendly - even though it seems that only kids are employed here.  Like most dry cleaning places, I'm not entirely sure where they do the cleaning, or just exactly what is it that they do to the garments.  But isn't it like that everywhere?  Realistically, if I had a stain or an issue that required more individualized attention, I would probably take it to different dry cleaner.  But if you're just wanting a basic, no-frills cleaning, then it's perfectly fine for your needs.

Let's face it, Taco Bell is bad news!  You know it - and I know it!  But we all have that guilty pleasure that, for whatever reason, provides us with comfort after a rough day.  For me, grabbing a Baja Blast and a few Taco Bell items drenched in my favorite (outside) sauce has always been at the top of my list.  And I think when you're reviewing Taco Bell, you're better off discussing the service as opposed to the actual food itself.  We already know the food is incredibly bad for you, so I'll just skip that part.  This was my go-to location for several years.  They've never messed up an order (something many TBs are notorious for doing) and they've always been very polite.  Plus, it's a standalone Taco Bell, shared with no sister business.  There's just something about those hybrid locations that makes me uneasy.  Like they're going to accidentally stick a KFC chicken wing inside my burrito supreme or fear of finding mashed potatoes in place of my sour cream.  Oh, the horror!  Unfortunately, despite being a Taco Bell-only location, I've watched the quality quickly drop these last couple of years.  There are many evenings where the drive-thru is held up, leaving customers completely trapped if someone pulls in behind you.  My worst experience once involved waiting 45 minutes (no joke!) in order to get my food.  And what's even more disturbing, is that when I finally made it to the window, they didn't even acknowledge that anything was wrong.  No offer to discount my food, no explanation, and most importantly, no apology.  There have been several instances where I've been trapped for a good 20-25 minutes and all have taken place in the last year or so.    Odd, that I've had hold-ups at other locations that have been 1/3 of this time and they've either discounted my meal or offered some free cinnamon twists for my troubles.  I don't even ask - they just do it.  The staff seems to be in constant rotation.  Yes, I realize that it's fast food, but their turnover rate seems higher than usual.  I still stop by every once in awhile, but I've found that I get more consistency over at the location off of 67th Avenue and Happy Valley.  Plus, they remember my name!  Sorry, guys!  Get your act together!

My experience with Robert C. Wesley Jewelers dates back to 2011, during my search for a Rolex Submariner. Initially, I visited a few other authorized dealers in Phoenix.  The salesman that I dealt with at these locations were just that.  Salesman.  They either didn't seem to care, or used such high pressure sales tactics to convince me to buy a watch right then and there, that I had minimal interest in dealing with them.  Someone on the Rolex Forums directed me to Lyndell Garcia.  I swung by to see him one day to simply inquire (not purchase) my watch.  There was absolutely no pressure.  He and I talked Rolex for a good 45 minutes, strangely enough, only discussing my Submariner for a brief period.  In the end, he simply told me to just come back whenever I'm ready.  A month later, that's exactly what I did.  I can't speak for the other jewelry here, but their Rolex selection is pretty vast.  Much bigger than the other places that I visited.  Lyndell really knows his stuff and is filled with all kinds of interesting stories.  If I ever wanted another watch, he's the first person I'd contact.  In the end, I was very happy with both my purchase and the whole experience, which is why I'm still remembering it five years later.  Highly recommended for Rolex!

Restaurants seem to have struck gold in capitalizing on the modern-day desires of burger lovers that stress the importance of quality over price. Zinburger, like so many others, clearly "gets it" when it comes to what makes up great burger.  For that, I have to give them credit.  Interestingly enough, higher quality burgers have quietly existed on menus at restaurants for many years, especially steakhouses.  But it wasn't until the last decade that people realized that these burgers could easily be marketed more prominently.  And it seems that they all opened up at exactly the same damned time.  Zinburger is no different.   We opted for the Zinburger and Samburger, which are both very good and pretty much what I expected.  We also ordered some double truffle fries, while also getting to try some regular fries which were brought out by accident. They were both decent, although not to the point where I'd rank them over some other places I've visited.  We played it smart by staying away from a shake until we finished our meals.  We decided on ordering a Nutella Hazelnut Crunch, while making the oh so controversial decision to modify it with a banana.  I really like that they let you split the shakes, serving them in separate glasses.  The shake actually was a big surprise and was definitely good enough that I'd want to return to try some of their other options, including the real desserts.  I sort of roll my eyes at all of these Fox concepts, because they can essentially open whatever type of restaurant they want, in whatever area they want, with the funds to make it look however they want.  Although I will always find more appreciation in individually owned burger places built from the ground up, I can't deny that the food here is very good.  And while I'd recommend Zinburger, I'd also recommend the 50 other burger places in Phoenix that pretty much use an identical approach - just not quite as loudly.  It's nothing innovating, but it works for the "concept" that it is.

Rocket Burger's restaurant setup is far from trendy, especially in comparison to all of the other burger places that keep popping up all over the city.  But don't let this fool you.  Rocket Burger offers some of the best burgers around, including some unique creations that might be somewhat intimidating to try at first.    Everything I've tried has been very good.  Although I wouldn't consider them the best I've ever had, they're definitely worthy of some high praise. Additionally, both their regular seasoned and cheese fries are also worth trying when paying a visit.  The cool thing about Rocket Burger is their massive variety of sodas! They carry many of my favorite brands, including Boylan and Jones, as well as many obscure flavors that you probably won't find anywhere else in Phoenix.  Very cool place that I recommend trying!

We stopped by here on a Saturday night.  It's been on the list for quite some time, especially after reading many of the glowingly positive reviews.  Plus, we were very excited to eat some barbeque with traditional sides (a la mac and cheese and cornbread).  I ordered my usual pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese and cornbread.  You know, I just assumed they have mac and cheese.  Every barbeque place does.    Nope.  Well, at least I can still get my cornbread, right?  Nope.  If you're going to have limited sides, then your barbeque better be pretty damned good.  And in this tragic case, it just simply wasn't.  Our pulled pork lacked flavor, with the meat chopped up into tiny little pieces, similar to the way canned dog food is made (see picture).  After dining at many great barbeque joints in the Phoenix area, we both agreed that's definitely not the way it's supposed to be done.  As another review noted, they're also skimpy on the sauce to the point where I almost burned through a whole bottle trying to breathe some kind of life into my sandwich.    The fried mac and cheese was coated into a batter that was very heavily seasoned to the point where we found it distracting.  Additionally, the fries, which are pretty hard to mess up, were also completely covered in a similar seasoning, which was just completely overkill.  Maybe the residents of Anthem are biased and simply take whatever they can get.  But this place isn't even in the same league at some of the far superior barbeque joints in Phoenix.    I guess we were expecting much more, but with so many excellent options available, this place definitely wasn't worth the 25 mile trip up North.  I guess when you have zero competition in your area, you obviously don't have to try very hard to impress people.  Not recommended!

The subs here are some of the best you can find!  The Priscuitto di Parma is my personal favorite, with the Da Vinci and Italian also being excellent choices.  If you find their size intimidating, you can ask for just half a sandwich. The quality of the subs completely exceeds anything you can get at the usual nearby chains.  As for their desserts, they have a wide variety of cake slices you can purchase. We're huge fans of their honey cake, but they have plenty of other choices to satisfy your sugar cravings. Chocolate mocha, coconut creme, and German chocolate are just a few examples. The problem is, however, since this is a Mom and Pop bakery, they aren't making these cakes through a massive assembly line that always guarantees freshness. Due to this, you might end up with a slice of cake that is somewhat stale and has probably been sitting in on their fridge for far too long. This has happened to us on a couple of occasions. So if you really want to try the best they have to offer, ask them what cake on the shelf is the most recently made.  I see a lot of people going in and out with cakes for special occasions. I've never had the opportunity to try one, but I have a feeling based on the awards these people have won that they're probably very good.  Stop by and get yourself a sub and some dessert.  You won't be disappointed!

The original PoPo's location (on Indian School) was and continues to be immensely popular with my former work colleagues.  Originally, based on my naive gringo standards, I embarrassingly considered PoPo's the best Mexican food in all of Phoenix!  Thankfully, I've learned a thing or two since then.  Initially, I was glad this location opened up, as it's in a slightly less dangerous area that reduces the likelihood of me being shot or stabbed after sundown.  The food and service are pretty consistent, which isn't really anything spectacular.  PoPo's falls under the "dirty" Mexican restaurant category in the sense that, you shouldn't really expect anything fancy.  In the past, we've had stale chips, crumb-covered booths, and menus splattered with the prior guests' salsa droplets.  These are things that you just kind of have to overlook.    I usually order their chimichanga.  While good, I've found that the the chimi con queso at Carlos O'Brien's is a much more exciting way to enjoy this form of deep fried  decadence.  My girlfriend always orders enchiladas, but always winds up wanting them to taste much better than they actually do.  Their rice and beans are just standard.  What I do like, strangely enough, is their fried ice cream on the dessert menu.  Although not really a "Mexican" dessert per se, it's become a staple with Americanized Mexican cousine.  You can blame the old Chi-Chi's chain for that.  Anyway, we've had bad versions and good versions.  PoPo's actually does it better than most, aside from a single botch job where they apparently forgot to bread the damned scoop!    Consistency, people!  Get with it!  Most of these Mexican places on Bell Road are pretty average.  PoPo's isn't really any different.  But after expanding my boundaries in recent years, I no longer consider it to be one of the better options in Phoenix compared to its competitors.

The more I try them, the less I like them.    The Firehouse Meatball, Italian, and Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket are all fairly decent choices in comparison to other fast-food level sub shops.  They seem to excel more with their "hot" subs than they do their cold ones.  The reason I don't visit this location more often is due to the inconvenience involved.  On some evenings, I've easily had to wait 15-20 minutes for a single sub.  I'd like to use the "because it's made fresh" excuse, but I'm sorry.  Unless they're physically slaughtering turkeys and pigs behind their concealed prep counter, I really don't think their subs are fresher than other places.  That doesn't mean they aren't good, however.  The setup in Firehouse is really weird.  The prep counter is closed off, so unlike its competitors, no one can actually SEE what they're doing.  Also, because the sandwiches sometimes take awhile, you often have a bunch of customers awkwardly standing around waiting in front of the counter.  It makes for some confusion at times. Especially if you've never been here before.  Overall though, their subs are average at best.  Service is okay, although I did have a couple of incidents where a girl vertically bagged a meatball and handed it to me (cringe).  But hey, it's still a step up from Subway.

We've visited Paradise Valley Burger Company on two separate occasions now.  The only reason I'm holding back on giving it a perfect five stars, is because I want to try some of their other burgers to see how well they compare to what we've already sampled.  This burger joint is a complete hole-in-the-wall establishment.  A truly local business that, rather than being part of some giant "concept" corporation, has been built from the ground up and has developed a massive following as a result.    In some ways, it's funny.  Places like this usually don't exist in relatively dull suburban areas, but seem to be located more in local "hot spots" that are situated in downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale, or somewhere in Tempe.  I think that's partly what makes it so refreshing and a reminder that good food can be found virtually anywhere if you're willing to take risks and go looking for it.  PVBC is very small.  And very crowded.  If you're looking to dine-in, this can sometimes be frustrating, because both times we visited, my girlfriend and I were afraid we wouldn't able to find a table.  It doesn't help that many of the tables are situated to where you're forced to eat elbow-to-elbow with guests.  But you know what?  These things can easily be forgiven when your burgers are this good!  On both occasions, I've had the highly recommended Brulee burger, which is an extremely elaborate and unique concept burger that incorporates bacon, onion, burnt sugar, havarti, and my all-time favorite burger addition: the fried egg.  The taste is a combination of both traditional and unique flavor, that makes for a superb result that is different - but not different enough to where I find it offensive.  The Paradise CHZ is also excellent for those of you who are more traditionalists.    Seasoned fries, french toast fries, and pretzel fries, purchased on special, are all excellent and worth trying based on your mood.  The Lucky Charms shake I ordered on my first visit is pretty much self-explanatory.  It was good, but something that anyone can easily duplicate, so I can't really say I'd order it a second time.  Strangely enough, this place also has tacos.  No one ever seems to get them and I'm curious how well they compare to the burgers.  After watching their piece on DDD and seeing all of the elaborate work that goes into these burgers, as well as their reasoning for the square bun, the 2-2oz patty approach, and the work that goes into the preparation, I feel that this place has to be visited multiple times to really be able to appreciate all of their creations.  And that's why I intend to return more regularly to see what else they have to offer.  I'll say this: There are so many gourmet burger places opening up all over the city that are essentially all carbon copies of each other.  They're all good, but they're all, dare I say - safe.  This is one place that focuses more in innovative creations, which I find incredibly refreshing in the current food culture of Phoenix.  There's a reason why it's so popular.    Highly recommended!

There are so many burger places littered throughout this city, all charging upwards of 10-15 dollars for a burger because the meat is grass fed, organic, or comes from some fantasy land that can only be accessible by white hipsters with beards.  Then you have places like The Habit that do things the old school way.  Or better yet, the easy way!  The burgers taste great, the quality is consistent, and get this - the prices are actually cheap!  How is this possible, you might ask?  Simply put, they don't feel the need to feed you the BS.  Like In-N-Out, The Habit knows exactly what it's doing.  There's no need to try to be all unique and "ironic" with your burger creations.  Keep things simple, keep things cheap, and keep the quality high.  It's an automatic recipe for success.  The Habit, despite being a fast food joint, offers burgers that are easily ranked right up there with some of the more upscale places you can find nearby.  I usually opt for a single Charburger with fries, which is more than enough to fill up the average person.  However, I intend to take things up a notch and try their Santa Barbara style burger during our next visit.  This is a place that offers a great no frills approach.  No silly gimmicks, annoying trendy décor, or some desperate attempt to justify overpriced crap.  It's simply just traditional burgers done extremely well.  And judging by the business they get, I'm pretty sure that's what most people want.  On a side note, their chocolate malts are a great dessert, although I wouldn't recommend getting them until after your meal.  They'll fill you up quite fast otherwise.  One of our favorite burger places in Phoenix!

In many ways, Geico has always reminded me of a cable company. They'll lure you in by offering a really good rate.  And then, every six months, they'll jack up the price - without any reason for doing so other than reading off their standard "rates have recently went up in /insert state here/" script.  It's virtually identical to the experience you'll get with any Internet Service Provider or cable company.    I own a 2009 Toyota Yaris - quite possibly, the cheapest and most lamest car that Toyota produces.  I've been driving for almost eighteen years. I've never caused an accident - ever!  I've been in the same house for seven years and have owned my car for just as long - which is basically worthless due to its age and 200K high mileage. The last time I was pulled over by the police (in a different state), the twin towers were still standing and cell phone screens were still black and white.  Yet, every six months, without fail, my policy only goes in one direction:   UP! UP! UP!  Insuring a car with over 200K miles on it that's practically worthless and used as nothing more than a putter car to get me from point A to point B is still essential.  But cable companying the rates every six months just to squeeze every last dime out of a customer?  That's just flat-out greed.   Customer service wise, I've never had a problem with Geico agents.  I have their roadside assistance, which I've used maybe twice in the last nine years.  Once to jump a battery and once to put on a donut tire.  No problems whatsoever, which is why I will give them an extra star.  But this whole jacking up rates just for the sake of jacking up rates isn't a very good way to acknowledge customer loyalty.  My rates today compared to just a few years ago are quite disturbing, which makes me feel especially bad for people who have actually caused an accident.  I don't even want to imagine how badly they get dinged.  Not recommended!

My fascination with Pizzeria Bianco originally stems from a late night visit to the downtown location about 8 years ago in Heritage Square.  Back then, things operated a little differently.  All pies were exclusively made by Chris Bianco himself, which clearly showed that quality and consistency were two concepts that this establishment greatly emphasized.  Watching Chris work his magic and listening to him talk revealed just how passionate the guy is about his food.  After getting my first taste, I've been hooked ever since.  Things are a little different now.  While Chris can often still be seen in the kitchen or around his various restaurants, the pizza making process is now shared with his kitchen staff.  Thanks to his expansion, wait times are now minimal.  But anyone who fears that there would be a drop in quality can rest easy.  The pizzas are just as great as they were back in the day.  Fresh ingredients and perfectly charred crust that's bursting with flavor, Bianco's pizza easily sets the golden standard for what good pizza truly is.  The Town and Country location is particularly special because of its expanded menu.  In addition to the pizzas, you can choose from a variety of pastas, which are all made in house.  The bread, baked by Chris' brother, Marco, and served with olive oil, is hands-down the best bread I've ever tasted.  Again, there's no need to drown this stuff in cheese or garlic.  Its flavor stands on its own and is an essential starter to any pizza or pasta dish.  As for their pizzas, use a Margherita as a baseline and work your way up the Rosa, which is the most unique pie on the menu and one of my personal favorites.  A good pizza is all about balance.  One where you can taste all of the ingredients and be able to appreciate how they compliment each other.  In a world where pizza joints drown their pies in cheese or shamefully pile on a mountain of different meats, these pizzas thrive on their simplicity. With six pies to choose from and an occasional market pizza, there's no need for anything else.   Admittedly, their desserts are kind of hit and miss.  Bianco's traditional array of sweet dishes are all passable, but if you come on Tuesday nights, there's a good chance that Chris's mother, Francesca, takes things up a notch with one of her homemade specialties.  If it's a spongecake night, then everything else on the dessert menu suddenly becomes irrelevant.    They also offer various seasonal features, including an amazing Tres Leches cake, which has been a "seasonal feature" for almost a year now.  Maybe it's an inside joke since Arizona doesn't have seasons?  Just make it a permanent staple already!    My only gripe is that, since we dine here regularly, some of their inconsistencies start to expose themselves over time.  Not so much with the pizza, which is consistently made to perfection, but with other things.  On one memorable occasion, a server refused to let us order a half-half pizza, claiming that it's forbidden - despite every other employee not so much as batting an eye when we've asked.  When I attempted to politely explain this, he claimed it must have been non-dinner hours, which definitely isn't true.  On a more recent occasion, they apparently forgot the leche on the Tres Leches, as it was unusually dry (and most likely old).  During a recent visit, the Italian ice, which is always superb, featured biscotti that was so rock-hard that we were afraid we'd break our teeth on it.  It was the only time we've ever had to say something to the staff.  Initially, I was surprised that this place only has 3.5 stars, but after noticing a lot of these inconsistencies, if they occurred during my first visit, I probably wouldn't rate them as highly as I do.  Nevertheless, service has always been decent and we've never had any real problems.  The clientele is a mix of young and old.  It's a great date place where you'll never feel out of place or uncomfortable.  We go here about once a month, whether it be trying new foods or revisiting old favorites.  Highly recommended!

Il Bosco offers some extremely good pizza that puts them right up there with some of the best in Phoenix.  We've tried a handful of different pies, but thus far, the Mia (eggs, pancetta, chives) and Biaggia (prosciutto, figs, goat cheese, arugula) are two of our favorites.  There are very few pizza places we've encountered that execute their crust to the point where it has that slightly charred, crunchy outer shell, but still manages to be soft, moist, and airy on the inside.  They totally nailed it here!   Even their bread with olive oil impresses, having that lovely rustic flavor that can easily stand on its own. The complimentary olives are a nice touch - if you like olives, of course.  I rarely drink wine, but choosing a soda line that's exclusively from Boylan is enough to keep a soda junkie very happy.  The location is tucked away in a Scottsdale plaza.  We almost missed it on our first visit, but I really like both the indoor and outdoor atmosphere.  Tiny wood-fired pizzerias always work best in smaller spaces, because the lovely aroma immediately greets you when you walk in.  Additionally, I've always liked places where the owner is actually there, working, serving, and interacting with customers.  He seems to be very passionate about his pizza and clearly knows the craft quite well.    As for desserts, you have several options. We've tried both the regular brownie and pumpkin brownie, which were pretty standard fare.  They have a chocolate chip cookie, which was incredible the first time we ordered it. Served warm and soft with a scoop of ice cream on top and consumed via spoons, it was a surprise hit!  Think of a "pizookie," just baked a little further.  The second time, we expected the same thing, only to get a charred cookie that was completely burned black, much to our disappointment.  Clearly there's a consistency issue on the dessert end.  While I won't jump on the "So much better than Bianco" bandwagon, I still consider this to be one of your better options in the entire city.    Quickly becoming one of our favorites!

There's a sign posted inside FastMed that reads: We Strive for Gold!  Apparently, they're referring to the gold that lies within your pockets.    This sums up my opinion of this particular urgent care facility pretty well.  My initial visit involved going in for some rather ugly flu-like symptoms. After speaking with the Physician Assistant (there are no real doctors here to my knowledge), he quickly diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed the appropriate medication.  When I questioned if he were certain that I didn't have the flu, he shrugged and said that I'm not displaying flu-like symptoms, but if I want peace of mind, they can give me a flu test.    "Oops.  It turns out you DO have the flu!"    Uhh...yeah.    The second visit ran a bit more smoothly, as I simply had an ear infection that required cleaning and a medication prescription.  Pretty standard stuff.  My third, more dramatic visit, involved getting treated for an ugly finger laceration that required five stitches. Naturally, my agitation was a bit higher during this experience, so the mandatory two hour wait became a bit more of a burden.  Most of the staff seemed rather cold, which I'm guessing is the usual desensitization to all of the things they see.  The PA who actually performed the stitch work was totally professional and was the only one who actually seemed empathetic, so I'll give them an extra star for this.  Now, here's what you need to be warned about.  If you get stitches here, don't expect to return for a courtesy follow-up without having to shell out another copay.  I was originally going to go to my personal doctor for the removal, but they advised me to return to the urgent care who originally performed the procedure.  Since the removal is largely considered part of the treatment follow-up of work that they've already done, the removal should be performed at no charge.  While this might be true at most urgent care facilities, it certainly isn't true at this one.  I've had stitches several times throughout my life.  Not once was I ever charged an additional copay visit for the removal, including some reputable surgeons.  Can you say greedy?    They've adopted a policy where, if they don't know what your copay is, they'll charge you 125 dollars.  If your copay ends up being less, they will refund you the difference.  Obviously, they do this to avoid patients "stiffing" them.  The receptionist charged me this fee, since she said my insurance card didn't list my copay.  I called my insurance, which took a whopping two minutes, in order to determine what my actual copay was.     Be prepared to wait at least two hours, regardless of what the issue is. Yes, I'm aware of the irony given the name.    I'd go here as an absolute last resort, but after learning about their current greed, I'll stick with other urgent care facilities.  Not recommended.

We swung by Central Bistro due to our original choice being unexpectedly closed for a private party.  I've passed by this place constantly and it's been bookmarked for quite some time.  It looks to be fairly popular, so we took a risk.    Unfortunately, it's a risk that didn't pay off.  The décor itself is quite nice, with their exposed brick and sleek looking designs.  It looks like the perfect type of restaurant to satisfy the "wino" crowd, although a bit too manufactured to really be considered a warm place of gathering.  I wish I had more good things to say about this place, but I'm really struggling here.  Service at this restaurant was very poor.  I'm not sure if our guy lacked experience, was having an off day, or had simply been serving for one too many years.  I asked for a Diet Coke.  I received an iced tea.  When our appetizer came out, I politely asked again for my Diet Coke.   Almost a half hour goes by and I never receive it.  I was seconds away from entering the kitchen myself, possibly wondering if requesting a basic soda was just asking too much of this establishment - until our actual dinner was brought out by someone else.  Thankfully, my third request was granted fairly quickly.  30 minutes for a soda?  Ouch!  We opted for some bread as an appetizer, which I'm pretty sure is just their "drunk bread" in its naked form with some olive oil.  It was okay, but we probably should have opted for a "drunk" variation.  Oh well.  For dinner, we had the taglietelle bolognese.  Since we were splitting it, they were kind enough to serve it in two separate dishes, which was one of the few things I do give them some credit for.  The pasta was okay, although you don't have to drive too far to find the identical entrée in superior forms.  We then ordered a margherita as a baseline to see how their pizza holds up.  They did not describe the margherita on the menu, simply stating it's the "classic."  Well, apparently, their idea of a margherita vastly differs from ours.  We've eaten enough margheritas over the last few years to feed a small Italian village and this is the only one that uses marinara instead of traditional tomato sauce.  Why?  Did they run out of tomato sauce?  Are they trying to bend the rules?  Or did the chef simply perform a botch-job on the most basic of all pizza pies?   The crust's flavor was practically nonexistent.  I would try some of their other pizzas, but if you can't do a margherita right, I'm pretty sure there's not much that you CAN do right when you're dabbling in pizza.  For dessert, we opted for the German chocolate cake, which ended up being a disappointment.  Its consistency was similar to those dry dessert cakes that they often serve at chain restaurants, a red flag that it probably wasn't made recently.  The coconut-pecan frosting that is a staple of all German chocolate cakes was conspicuously absent, replaced with something that was more similar to pudding.  I originally overlooked their unisex restrooms and ended up using their ghastly designed urinal room that is closed off by nothing beyond a couple of swinging saloon doors.  Considering I'm just several feet away from kitchen staff and other customers, it's a mere step up from just holding up a protective sheet for privacy while I pee in front of all the patrons.  I'm sorry.  Too many disappointments to give them a second chance and too many other options to really consider this place worth revisiting, despite the fact that they have a breakfast menu that I'll probably never try.  Not recommended!

This place is a bit of a hidden gem.  After visiting several of the bigger stores that essentially carry the same overpriced furniture with questionable quality, I ended up finding the perfect bedroom set for my spare room at this location.  The older gentleman who helped us was very informative, giving us absolutely no fuss or cheap salesman tactics.  The deal we received was excellent!  I only wish I would have known about this place sooner.    We'll definitely return when I need some additional furnishings.  Highly recommended!

Absolutely superb bundt cakes that completely exceeded my initial expectations!    The cakes are high quality, with great, moist flavor and a signature cream cheese frosting.  I've yet to try everything on the menu, but speak very highly of their red velvet, cinnamon swirl, and white-white chocolate.    They also offer seasonal flavors as well - although I think we'll be converting to a set of mini-sized cakes in order to cover more flavors in a single visit from now on.   The staff is always friendly and I've never had a bad experience here. Their 6pm close time sometimes makes for a rush to get there.  Expanded hours would be nice, especially considering they're a chain. But that's just a mild annoyance.  Highly recommended!

Fact: Matt's Big Breakfast has pretty much ruined breakfast for me for all of eternity.  Since first trying it a few years back, I've found that it's done so exceptionally well that I'm constantly making comparisons between Matt's and every other breakfast place in Phoenix.  And my conclusion remains consistent:  Absolutely no one compares.  Thriving off of simplicity in a similar manner to Pizzeria Bianco, Matt's doesn't need 500 different types of pancakes, all with varying amounts of rubbish dumped all over them.  Blasting thumpy music, making up stupid names for omlettes, or serving up liquor in the AM as a means to be "edgy" are all silly gimmicks that are absolutely unnecessary when your food tastes like this.  The fact is, when your food is good, you don't need tricks and tactics in order to compensate.  Keep the choices minimal, the dishes fairly traditional, and the quality high and you have an automatic formula for success.  Don't believe me?  Look at the lines on the weekend.  Practically all foods you find here are either homemade or outsourced locally.  I'm told there's no freezer and technically, if food is fresh, isn't that the way it should be?  I typically order the Hog & Chick, scrambling up my eggs with one or two of their cheeses.  The bacon, which comes from the Pork Shop in Queen Creek, is thick, juicy, peppered, and absolutely fabulous.  There is no bacon I've found that even comes close.  Add in some hash browns (extra crispy) that have butter cooked directly into them, some toast that's complimented by homemade jam that's personally made by Matt's wife, and you're pretty much covered for a great morning meal.  The jam can also be purchased separately by the jar for home use.  Even their orange juice and honey lemonades impress!  The Five Spot, which is a sandwich that combines some of the ingredients I just mentioned, is also worth trying. Although I prefer being able to appreciate these foods individually rather than combining them all.  Their griddlecakes and waffle are excellent, being served with syrup that's actually hot (other places should take note of this).  Although I don't regularly order either, as they come at the expense of missing out on the smaller side dishes (unless your stomach has the extra space).  Service is good, food is great, and parking is a pain (an unwritten legal requirement for all good restaurants near downtown).  I've been told they have a great lunch, but with breakfast this good, I don't think I have I'll ever have the willpower to order anything lunch-related.  French toast, which is strangely absent from the permanent menu, is actually a special on Wednesdays and also worth checking out.   Highly recommended!

I've always liked places where the owner is actually involved with his restaurant, which seems to be the case at this particular breakfast spot. And if you look at some of the photos on the wall, clearly this is a guy who has years of experience at what he does.  It most definitely shows in the quality of the food and the service that's provided.  Admittedly, it took a few visits for me to realize that the food here is better than what most standard breakfast restaurants offer.  Lots of options on the menu, which includes a combination of both slightly unique and original choices.  I always end up getting the French Toast (San Francisco style), although I'm still not entirely sure where they got this name. Nevertheless, the concept of deep fried french toast is sheer genius!  The bacon, eggs, and pancakes (w/bananas and pecans) are all done very well.  Always be sure to request the maple syrup upgrade.  Although I haven't gotten around to trying something more daring on the menu, I'm sure there's a few undiscovered gems for people who like taking risks.  They do make an effort to source out locally when possible, although I don't think they do it to the extent that places like Matt's Big Breakfast (my all-time favorite do).  I mean, their bacon is good and their OJ is passable, but not quite to the point where it'll blow your mind.  But the quality of their food seems to be pretty consistent and I think that's what they're going for.  I've never had a bad meal here.  Be prepared to wait on the weekend.  It's become quite a popular spot and I feel it's rightfully deserved.  Excellent breakfast establishment all-around!

Based on all of the great Yelp reviews, SOLO has been on our list for awhile.  We're all about visiting family-owned restaurants.  The pictures look good, but I think our expectations were just too high going in.  SOLO is tucked away in the Camelback Esplanade complex, an area that seemed kind of dark and dead on a Saturday night.  There were plenty of patrons within the restaurant, however, which has both patio and indoor seating.  The décor is a combination of both traditional and modern, with walls scattered with artwork that's also for sale (a la Barrio café).  We love burrata and saw some pictures of some burrata bruschetta. They were offering an acorn squash bruschetta that included burrata. The cheese was okay, although isn't burrata supposed to be creamy?  The puree squash spread just didn't really do it for us. Maybe we just made a poor choice for our tastes, but it just reminded me too much of baby food. There's a picture on the website (and on Yelp) of some creamy burrata bruschetta which I'm guessing is probably much better.  Their housemade bread was the best part of the meal - and I'm not entirely sure that's a good thing.  Freshly baked with a nice crispy outer layer, while still managing to be soft and flavorful on the inside.   We ordered a pappardelle pasta.  As another reviewer noted, there's nothing wrong with the pasta itself.  But the sauce is void of any flavor, which really puts a damper on its potential.  We actually had to add salt, which should be the absolute last thing you should ever had to do to liven up a pasta.  For pizza, we opted for the ham and fig pizza, which also includes prosciutto.  The ingredients were acceptable, but the crust was pretty bland and didn't really offer up any flavor pop.  Having regularly dined at many of the popular pizzerias in the area, I guess we're just too damned spoiled.  They do offer a free dessert for Yelp check-in.  We chose the lava cake, which was just okay.  We would have ordered the affagato, but their presentation didn't quite look as exciting as some of the variations we've had at other places in town.  The service was okay and the place has a pretty calm and relaxing atmosphere, so I will give them a bit of credit for that.  But with so many other options available that are within miles of this place, we didn't really feel it lived up to the hype.    Many people seem to like it, so they must be doing something right.  But ultimately, it just wasn't for us, I guess.

Yo & I has always fascinated me.    If you didn't know any better, you'd pass by, wrongfully assuming it's just another generic frozen yogurt shop buried within a strip mall.  It's wasn't until I researched Yelp that I discovered that they actually sell shaved snoh and various boba drinks.  Although I could be wrong, but I'm going to guess that they were originally a "fro yo" shop that decided to re-brand.  If true, this is probably for the best anyway, as frozen yogurt places are a dime a dozen in Phoenix.  Although they should probably do a better job of letting people know that they're NOT just a frozen yogurt shop, because that's essentially what it looks like when walking by.  They offer various flavors of snoh and all of the traditional toppings you'd expect.  Although not the best snoh I've ever had (it's a bit on the icy side), that's just simply nitpicking.  I just wish they offered a coconut flavor, although what they do offer is pretty decent.  Additionally, the taro house special was recommended to my girlfriend by the very friendly owner, which ended up being excellent.    Go in and play a game of Jenga, which is a mandatory requirement at all places that serve boba drinks and snoh.  A cool little neighborhood place that can easily be overlooked if you aren't careful!

I honestly never expected much out of U.S. Egg, assuming it'd be just another clone of the various Good (Mediocre) Egg locations you see scattered about Phoenix.  And while I can't speak for any of the other U.S. locations, I can at least vouch for this one.  The main reason I rate this place highly is for its consistency and efficiency.  Servers always seem be on top of things and we've yet to have a bad meal here.  While their eggs, hash browns, and bacon are all acceptable, we've found that their signature protein pancakes are what's most appreciated.   They include a mixture of blueberries, granola, cinnamon, and slivered almonds and can be optionally upgraded or tacked onto any meal that you're having.  There's a reason why everyone recommends them.  We did have one sole incident where our pancakes were visibly burnt, so we had to flag down the server and request some replacements.  That's the only time we've ever had an issue.  Fortunately, the problem was fixed without questions or hassle.  They remain open till 2:30pm, whereas most breakfast joints close a half hour earlier.  The extra 30 minutes comes in handy more often than one would assume.  Although Mike and Ronda's "The Place" a little further up the road has traditionally remained the default choice if you're having a massive 25-relative weekend breakfast family gathering, I've found that I like the food (and the calmer environment) of U.S. Egg much better.

Republica Empanada is an excellent little establishment that, despite being located in Mesa, would fit in perfectly with all of the hipster "foodie" joints in Central Phoenix.  As the name states, this place serves empanadas.  Pretty damned good ones, too.  So if that's not your thing, I wouldn't bother coming here.  I prefer getting the platter, which allows you to pick any two empanadas, which also includes rice, beans, and some excellent maduros.  The pernil is decent, although it's just one boatload of meat.   I suggest ordering it in its boricua form to make it a little more interesting.  The republica chicken is high quality, but strangely enough, my favorite out of all of them is the basic cheese.  We've tried two dessert empanadas that both delivered.  The fail-safe combination of banana and nutella, as well as the The King, which as expected, includes peanut butter and banana.  With the option of adding ice cream and drizzle, you can't really go wrong with either choice.  As some other reviewers have noted, service seems a bit off.   But since the food is good, I guess I'm a bit more forgiving.  Things just don't seem very organized.  On our last visit, we had two separate people try to reluctantly seat us.  After one of them took our order, a second one approached us, also attempting to take our order.    Despite these issues, we really enjoy the food here and will definitely be returning again to try some of their other options.  Highly recommended!

I had high hopes for this business after I contacted them to quote me on some minor work that needed to be completed on my roof.  They were very quick to come out and give me an honest estimate, which was only a few hundred dollars.  Unfortunately, I guess the estimated work wasn't lucrative enough, because they seemed to have zero interest in actually putting me on the schedule.   I kept calling and/or e-mailing the lady, trying to find out when they would be coming, only to get the run-around. It went from being "sometime next week," to "sometime soon," to the lady flat out admitting that she had absolutely no idea when they would be coming out.  I was given the owner's personal cell, which didn't really help matters much, as he never responded to my request for a status update.  I eventually became agitated to the point where I contacted them and said that I would find another company to do my work, which was taken care of rather quickly.   Horrible communication.  They might be great if you need a new roof, but if it's only minor repair work, I suggest going with a different company.

Ingo's is a hip little patio restaurant that, like Chelsea's Kitchen, falls under the Le Grande Orange umbrella.  It's what I would call a "food stand" approach that offers a pretty straight-forward menu that isn't overly complicated. Bar seating inside and patio dining on the outside.   We've been here three times and always get the shattered potato chips as a starter.  Although, as most reviewers will point out, they're not really chips, but slices of a potato.  The lebni addition is a nice touch, although if there is sea salt incorporated, I certainly couldn't taste it.  I feel they would have benefited from a little sprinkle of salt and ketchup on the side, which I'm pretty sure Ingo's sees as the equivalent of poison based on its limited availability. I will have my girlfriend smuggle some in her purse on her next visit and hope that we won't be banned for doing so.  The burgers here are on par with what you'd get at most of the gourmet burger places in Phoenix.  We've ordered both the Ingo Cheeseburger and Paris, Texas Burger.  I recommend opting for the LGO English Muffin instead of the traditional bun, which is what currently sets them apart (at least until Diablo Burger opens up).  Any Ingo Cheeseburger can be further enhanced with the addition of a fried egg.   They're good, but not quite in the same league as the LGO Burger served next door, which is a whole other experience.  They used to offer ice cream sandwiches for dessert here when they first opened.  Those have since been eliminated.  You can still get miniature versions of their sea salt cookie.  Sometimes the server will give you one or sometimes you just have to go inside and take one.  Being a true heel, I took two for myself.  Just don't tell anyone.  Overall, I like Ingo's for a quick dinner.  I feel it's worth the occasional visit, but  it's kind of hard to choose eating here when it's placed right next to its superior big brother in LGO.

Every time my girlfriend and I visit Pizzeria Bianco, we can't help but notice Grassroots.  I've always wanted to give them a try, as it always seems to have a fair amount of customers dining both inside and out on the patio area.  Reviews were decent, so our expectations were reasonably high.  Unfortunately, after experiencing Grassroots once, it reminds me of a lot of trendy places in Phoenix that place too much emphasis on ambiance and not enough emphasis on the food itself.  Another reviewer described this restaurant as "pointless," which I feel is a pretty good adjective to sum up my thoughts.  In short, it's just simply not my style.  The food isn't necessarily Southern comfort food, but food that is Southern-influenced, if that makes any sense. Maybe it's a slightly more modernized version, while throwing in a lot of wines and locally crafted beers that seem to be mandatory at most "hip" places these days.  We started with the creamy burrata, which drops a Scottsdale zip code in its title.  I'm assuming this is a reference to its original source?  The burrata is served with a spicy tomato jam, a consistency that is typically reserved for fruits (as it should be).  We didn't like it.  Not because it tasted bad.  It just simply didn't taste like anything!  I scooped some on my knife and asked my girlfriend if she could detect any flavor whatsoever. She couldn't.  Nor could I.  It's not even in the same league as the burrata served at nearby Federal Pizza.  Hell, we'd be better off smuggling in some generic cream cheese!  The spicy tomato jam was just flat out bizarre.  Think of the familiar jam consistency, only with a ketchup-like flavor that includes a bit of spice.  It's different, but it just seemed wrong.  For entrees, I ordered the braised short ribs, which came with a little asparagus and the ever-so-popular jalapeno cheese grits.  For 24 dollars, the serving size was pretty stingy.  The ribs tasted fine.  The mouthfuls of fat I ended up chewing up whole on a handful of bites?  Not so much. The grits were basically your standard grits with a bit of jalapeno flavor in them.  Their novelty wore off after a couple of bites and I didn't finish them.    My girlfriend ordered the shrimp po ' boy, which she said didn't have as much flavor as she expected.  The fries, which I did sample, seemed to have an odd aftertaste which I'm pretty sure was the result of the oil that was being used that completely killed off any potential potato flavor.    Okay, so I'm not completely cynical.  The chocolate toffee brownie was excellent, so that's one offering that I feel warrants some praise.  Not enough to where I'd ever go back, but enough to where I'd definitely recommend it.  It tasted like it was brought to our table immediately after being pulled from the oven.      I really wanted to like this place.  The service was fine, but I guess the food just wasn't for us.  As previously stated, the place just seems kind of . . . pointless.  On a more positive note, my little chihuahua and I argued endlessly over the quality of the short ribs.  He claims they're top notch, as evidence by how quickly he devoured my remnants.  I still maintain that they're rubbish - but whatever.  Agree to disagree.

I must say, we didn't really expect much going into this little restaurant.  It was an early Saturday night and aside from one full table and a few people at the bar, no one else was dining there.    Mejico is in an area that's primarily residential and features a nice backyard patio area that's fenced in.  Service was good and prices were reasonable for the amount of food that we received.  I don't like fish, so I opted for a carne asada and pollo taco combination with rice and beans.  They were out of refried beans, so I decided on some pinto beans as an alternative.  The rice, in particular, was excellent. The tacos had a good amount of flavor to them.  My girlfriend ordered the enchiladas de pollo, which also had great flavor.  I've also had their enchilladas de res, which did not disappoint.    Offering up the big "Medio Litro" Mexican cokes, some good quality chips and salsa, as well as some flan desert that actually impressed someone who isn't really a flan fan, and you really don't have much to complain about.  The only exception would be the pinto beans.  The first time, we received a cup of beans, while the second time, it felt more along the lines of eating bean soup.  We'll return to sample some of their other menu offerings very soon before giving it a full five star bump.  But I definitely recommend paying them a visit!

Be warned that the ultra-cool and delightfully charming lucha libre décor  has been completely removed.  Since this place was a near carbon copy of a concept that was copyrighted in San Diego (name included), they were forced to completely re-brand.  I originally thought they were going to overhaul the entire place, but it looks like they've kind of just given up on redecorating.  You're stuck eating tacos in a sterile looking dining room.  Although the decor is gone, the taco taste thankfully remains.  I've always been a big fan of the tacos here.  They used to allow you to sample the meats in order to reduce the risk of making any mistakes.  They've since eliminated this and I've had to update my review as a result.  Many of their juicier meats are extremely spicy, so I advise you to be careful. Aside from a few desserts (including some good churros), that's pretty much all they have.  But at least what they do have, they do exceptionally well.  I would like to point out that they do seem somewhat disorganized.  The last time we went in, a guy was behind the counter just giving us what appeared to be a "death stare."  It took a few minutes of awkward silence before the lady, who usually takes our orders, told us that he could help us.  Their tacos are still very good and most of the reviews you see on here are accurate - even if I desperately miss their old wrestling theme.

After eating a pretty damned good Indian meal at Marigold Maison over in Paradise Valley a few months ago, I guess I just assumed that all Indian food would be as good as theirs.  Although after eating here, my girlfriend and I quickly learned that's definitely not the case.  It's not necessarily that Saffron is bad.  I mean, there was nothing blatantly wrong with the food.  The server was polite and the place was clean.  It's simply that the food just wasn't very good.  We both ordered some lemonade with ginger, which was absolutely nothing like what we've had before.  The lemonade was extremely concentrated to the point where it was so potent that if there was, in fact, any ginger in the drink, it could not be detected.    For starters, we ordered a samosa and paneer pakora.  Someone on Yelp lists this as goat cheese, but I'm pretty sure they were misinformed.  Both were just kind of bland and not quite as tasteful as we had hoped.  For entrees, we had the chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken.  My girlfriend thought something was off with the chicken.  It didn't taste grilled, it tasted more like it was boiled - making it much softer than it should be.  We also ordered some garlic naan and rice, which again, just didn't really seem to impress in comparison to what we've had during prior experiences.  For dessert, we ordered the gulab jamun, which I'm pretty sure no one ever orders, as the server didn't seem to have any idea what we were asking for.  Thankfully, it was the one thing that we both enjoyed.  Overall, service was insanely slow for a place that was practically empty.  I'd love to give a higher rating to a little local business like this, but when there are much better options available, I don't see the need to ever really return.

Frost is one of those places that rightfully deserves all of the hype surrounding it.  It's just as good as everyone claims, putting surrounding places to complete shame in terms of their gelato quality.  So many of their flavors are just dead-on delicious, including salted caramel, honey, espresso chip, and even bubblegum (don't judge!). There's a wide variety of choices, including some seasonal exclusives that the staff will be more than happy to describe to you.  I really like that you can try multiple flavors, without having to purchase multiple cups in order to do so.    Despite their claims that it's less harsh than ice cream, I wouldn't pat yourself on the back and pretend that you're eating "healthy."  It might not be as heavy on the stomach, but it's still dangerously addicting enough to where I'm glad I don't live anywhere near this establishment.    Yes, they have free samples, but lines here can sometimes get congested at the counter, so I suggest sticking to the unwritten sample etiquette of only trying a few flavors before making a decision.  I prefer Biltmore over their other location in Gilbert.  While this particular location seems to do a good amount of business, it's absolutely nothing compared to the one in Gilbert, with lines so long that I often wonder if they're lacing their recipe with traces of cocaine.  Nothing compares!

Out of every Wal-mart I've visited in Phoenix, I find this location to be the most well-stocked with the necessities and variety.  Although I don't live in this area, I used to frequently venture here back in 2008-09 because of their vast selection of Blu-Ray movies (back when BD movies were still pretty scarce).    Unfortunately, this location is also quite dirty with a customer base that gets increasingly more scary deeper into the night.  This is largely a reflection of the area, which isn't the safest part of Bell Road.  It's one of those Wal-marts that gives those comedy websites their material.  I saw a girl get stopped by management and told that she either had to cover her bikini/bra top or leave the store.  I saw a fist fight almost erupt in the parking lot one evening.  And believe it or not, it's one of the few places that confirm that mullets do, in fact, still exist in present day.  Word of advice: Never leave your shopping cart unattended.  There were two separate incidents when I briefly parked my cart in order to grab something in a nearby aisle, only to find that a customer had removed my items and taken the cart for themselves!  All in a matter of seconds!  I never found the culprit(s) - and even if I did, I doubt I'd confront them out of a legitimate fear of being stabbed.   There's a reason I refer to it as the "Ghetto Wal-mart."  It definitely lives up to its name!

Chicken fingers: A permanent staple on all children's' menus in America! And yet, after reaching a certain age, there's a certain degree of shame associated with going to a nice restaurant and ordering some "fingers" if you're over the age of ten. And this is where Cane's comes in to cater to those of us who still love to eat these crispy strips, regardless of age.  Raising Cane's menu is extremely simplistic. You can get fingers or a sandwich (which is essentially the very same fingers between a bun). Sides that are typically ordered in a box combo consist of mediocre fries, delicious toast, and coleslaw.  Nothing else.   The chicken, which is never frozen, is pretty decent for a fast food place. Much better than what you can get at other places for this price (i.e. LJS, KFC, Culvers). Their sauce also works well, even though a few more options would be nice to try.  The only reason why this place loses a star by the standards of fast food is because they need more side options.  I'm all for the straight-forward In-N-Out-style menu, but some potato wedges, mashed potatoes, or biscuits would be a welcoming addition for those of us who aren't a fan of their fries.  Despite this minor qualm, their chicken is good and that's what they're all about, so I can't really knock them too harshly for anything else.   Give them a try!

We swung by here on a recent evening, hoping to find an undiscovered pizza mecca. Unfortunately, at least for Forge, they're going to have to turn things up a few notches to avoid the risk of being branded just another generic pizza joint in Phoenix.  We started out with the cheese curds, which were okay. Although to me, they came off more like round-shaped mozzarella sticks. Aren't curds usually of the cheddar variant?   For pizzas, we ordered the usual margherita baseline and a roasted corn, due to our mutual love of the roasted corn pizza served at nearby Le Grand Orange.  Honestly, neither one of them really impressed.  The roasted corn wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't what we were expecting.  Its overall dryness ruined it for us. The margherita, although better than the corn, just didn't really leave a lasting impression. Either Forge hasn't gotten their recipe right or whoever made the pizza completely botched them, as our crust was extremely salty - and I have a pretty high tolerance for salt.    We would have ordered their sole dessert option (dough nuts), but the server didn't bother asking if we wanted any dessert. Hey, at least we didn't have to wait an hour for the check like Forno301.  It was worth a try, but with so many other good places, I doubt we'll be back.

Naked BBQ first grabbed my attention when they initially had their giant "We Don't Cover Our Meat" billboard out on Bell Road.  Hey, it worked in getting my attention, even though it's since been removed for obvious reasons. Based on the Yelp reviews, I've always wanted to try Naked, but since they would close after lunch, it made the arrangements quite difficult.  Thankfully, they now open for dinner hours on the weekend, so my girlfriend and I were finally able to swing by on a Friday night to see if Naked's buzz is justified.  Naked BBQ is fairly small, brightly lit, and offers up a pretty straight forward menu that covers most of the essentials for meat-loving fans.  My girlfriend and I both ordered our preferred pulled pork sandwiches with some cornbread muffins.  I also requested a side of mac and cheese and some beans, although I wish they would have had the option for mashed potatoes.    First off, the BBQ meat here is absolutely superb!  Nice and juicy, tons of flavor, and was good enough that I'd say that it's right up there with some of the bigger guns in the city.  You have the option of sweet and spicy sauce. I enjoyed both.  Their cornbread muffins are small, although they gave me an extra one on request for free.  They use corn kernels inside, which I've never been a fan of (see my Lo Lo's review), but that's more of a subjective opinion than a quality issue.  Others seem to love it.  It's southern-style cornbread, which means that it's not overly sweetened.  Overall, I thought they were pretty good.  Sides are kind of small, but since the prices here are pretty fair, I can't really complain too much.  The mac and cheese was okay.  Although not the best I've ever had at a BBQ joint, it was still passable and better than what many other places serve out.  The beans were also decent enough.  In summary, I give this place credit, because absolutely nothing we ate here was bad.  For a small place that is still fairly new, I consider that to be a very commendable!    We'll definitely be back in the future, as I really want to try their hot links and perhaps one of their desserts.  Plus, I need about a month to figure out something witty to write on their wall that isn't filled with the usual cliches.    Highly recommended BBQ that definitely delivers the goods.  Well done!

Every time I develop the urge to play some classic arcade games, I used to venture out to Dave and Busters or Castles N Coasters .  In the end, it never ends up being as much fun as I had hoped.  This is primarily because most of the games are ultra-lame "interactive" machines that were released long after arcades reached their peak in the early 90s.  Plus, do any of us really give a damn about winning tickets to buy plush prizes?  If you're looking for that experience, go to Peter Piper!     Most retro gamers will tell you that the classics are where it's at. Thankfully, Starfighters Cafe is one of the few arcade establishment that actually "gets it."  This place completely embraces nostalgia, serving as a tribute to a pastime that is gone, but certainly not forgotten by many of us who grew up in the 1980s.  Starfighters fits the bill perfectly, as a place that would completely seduce my 10 year-old self, while my overprotective mother lectures me that spending more than 30 minutes inside will inevitably "warp" my brain.  Perfect!  You have the option of either a 30 dollar monthly membership or 14 dollar one-time fee for the evening for yourself and a guest.  This is the most logical choice for me, since I don't live anywhere near Mesa.  After getting your hand stamped, you're granted unlimited access to many arcade and pinball classics, all set to free play (as they should be), allowing you to relive many great memories from your childhood.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed a full play through of Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, I embarrassingly got my ass handed to me during a round of Street Fighter II, and munched up multiple ghosts on one of a handful of Pacman machines.  Additionally, there's many other games worth reliving, including Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Tron, and Golden Axe.  There's a mini snack bar, a jukebox playing awesome 80s tunes, and a little room with an NES hooked up that we didn't get the opportunity to check out.  For me, the real treat lies within the pinball machines.  Pin-Bot, Scared Stiff, Indiana Jones (Williams Version), and Space Station.  I was even surprised to see a Data East Back to the Future on location!  Some games appear to have been recently shopped with LEDs, while others look like their better days are probably behind them.  But all are in playable condition and great fun!  My only complaint is that the music is so loud that often times, you can't even hear many of the games.  Part of the charm of arcades is hearing all of these machines fill the room by simultaneously buzzing, beeping, ringing, and churning out delightfully simplistic MIDI music.  I love 80s music, but I also like being able to hear what's happening in the games I'm playing.  Since I rarely venture over to Mesa, it's unlikely that I'll ever become a regular.  But with places like this being so uncommon when there's obviously a niche demand, we definitely will return in the future!  Highly recommended to those who have fond memories of growing up in arcades!

What's this?  Good pizza in the Northwest Valley, you say?  In an area that's embarrassingly overloaded with local and national pizza chains, I was quite excited when discovering that Pomo Pizzeria quietly opened up a location just several miles from my house.  And with good reason.  Having become quite familiar with Pomo's downtown location, as well as a side-stop at their Scottsdale establishment, I knew this would be a welcoming addition to an area that isn't exactly renowned for its prime dining.  In some ways, I was sincerely hoping this Glendale location would eliminate the need to have to travel downtown to get my Pomo fix.  And while that's definitely true to some extent, there's a little something missing.  Actually, a few things, which I'll get to in a moment.  Make no mistake, the pizzas here are superb, providing a similar, although not quite duplicate experience of the other Pomo locations.  Now, bear in mind, if you're accustomed to Americanized pizza that you can get at any cookie cutter chain or sports bar in the area, then this pizza may throw you off.  Hell, the menu itself can be rather intimidating.  But approach things with an open mind and you'll quickly realize what you've been missing.  Their bread with olive oil is always a good way to start off.  For pizzas, they offer a basic Regina Margherita for those that want to play it safe.  However, I strongly suggest the Bufala Verace, which is essentially the same thing, only with mozzarella di bufala (buffalo cheese) in place of the usual parmigianno regiano.  Pomo also has a big hit with their Principe, which is a delightfully simple combination of priscuitto, parmigianno regiano, and arugula. There are many other options, but none seem to have any dramatic differences other than a few ingredients.  Ah, but it's not all about pizzas at Pomo.  While few people seem to be aware, this place also offers some of the best calzones you can find.  And while the traditional Calzone Napoletano might be a safe choice, it's their fried calzones that I consider to be their true menu gem.  The Pizza Fritta is worth a shot, but lacks core ingredients aside from cheese.  The Vesuvia is your best bet, due to its addition of prosciutto and spicy salame.  We order it every time with zero hesitation.  The homemade desserts are all very good, but not great.  The torta nutella, tiramisu, and affogato al caffe are worth trying.  Nothing here is mind-blowing in comparison to what I've had at other places, but that doesn't stop me from recommending them.  So, what stops me from giving this place a perfect five stars?  Well, the service still needs some work.  Soda refills seem to only come by request, even on dead evenings.  On one memorable occasion, we were served a completely botched affogato al caffe that was completely missing the gelato scoops.  It was essentially a glass of cold, coffee-flavored soup!  I'm not sure what's more unsettling, the fact that this made it out of the kitchen or the fact that the server was able to deliver it while maintaining a completely straight face.  Sorry, but eight dollar desserts shouldn't leave room for error.    There's also some little charms at the downtown location that are conspicuously absent from Glendale, such as having a plate of complimentary fried dough and limoncello shots automatically served to you after your meal.  I guess we've become spoiled.  If you read the downtown reviews, you'll see that little things like this are what make Pomo so highly acclaimed and I see no reason why this can't be carried over.   With that said, the pizza is still excellent and easily competes with some of the best that the city has to offer.  And for an area that is completely void of Neapolitan Pizza, I consider it a welcome addition!  Now, if only Master Chef Matteo would bring us some of those limoncello shots, we'd be all smiles!

We rarely venture into the Old Town area.  And honestly, with wood-fired pizza restaurants currently opening up like corner gas stations all over the damned city, the only reason I even took an interest in Craft 64 is because of the chef.  Horacio Hernandez runs the kitchen, known as the former right-hand man of some dude named Chris, who just so happens to make what many say is the best pizza in the entire country!  Being a Bianco regular, my expectations were very high indeed!  We stopped by on a Saturday night, which was pretty packed with multiple reserved tables on standby.  We were still able to get squeezed in within less than an hour.  They have a pretty extensive locally crafted beer list, which I'm sure will please many people that are into that scene.  I didn't try anything, but might be daring on a second visit just to see what I'm missing out on.  We barely made it in just minutes before Happy Hour prices ended, which enabled us to save a bit of cash on the appetizer.  The charcuterie board was our first choice, featuring some bread with olive oil, a couple of cheeses, grapes, nuts, seeds, soppressata and chorizo.  Everything on the plate was very fresh and tasted excellent.  The bread, however, was pretty standard-fare in comparison.  I guess we were expecting more of a rustic flavor based on the pictures we saw, but that doesn't mean that it was bad by any means.  For pizzas, we chose a margherita (or margarita in their case) as well as a FICO, due to our mutual loves of either figs and/or fig jam incorporated into a pizza.  First and foremost, I will say that the crust on these pizzas are done perfectly.  Oh, I've seen charred crust a million times, but few pizza makers are able to create this amazing texture of a crunchy outer-shell, with a soft, airy inside that almost melts in your mouth.  This place has it. Most places don't.  Well done!  As for the ingredients themselves, the margherita was decent.  However, we both found it strange that their mozzarella had a very sharp, almost cheddar-like aftertaste.  I'm not sure why.  My girlfriend seemed more put off than I was.  Very interesting.  The Fico offered a variety of high quality cheeses that all blended well, in addition to a very liberal amount of fig jam, which we really enjoyed.  If ordered again, I'd probably experiment with adding some prosciutto.   I really want to try out their Spain pizza, which sounds like it could either be delicious or a disaster depending on your personal tastes.  For dessert, we ordered the nutella indulgence.  We both love nutella, so this was a default choice.  It was decent, although as another reviewer noted, would probably benefit from a scoop of ice cream.  The best nutella desserts I've eaten are Cibo's banana crepes and a nutella/banana/walnut pizza at Base Pizzeria near Biltmore.  I wouldn't quite put it on par with those dishes, as I feel there's way too much going on with all of the combinations, but I do feel it's still worth trying out.   This place can get very loud!  Even if you're not sitting near the bar.  We were at the front of the restaurant and still struggled to converse, but I guess that's kind of to be expected at a bar-type of restaurant, right?  With a straight-forward menu that offers superb pizza that beats out a lot of its competitors, I predict this place will do extremely well!  Highly recommended!

We've become quite familiar with the various Pomo locations over the years, so I was intrigued by this little Italian restaurant that opened up next to Pomo's Glendale location.  I'm pretty sure they share the same kitchen, but offer more of a pasta-oriented eating experience (even though Pomo also has pastas).  We expected very good things based on our experiences next door.  We were promptly seated, as there were only a few other people in the restaurant itself.  We started with some bread, but had to actually request a bottle of olive oil from the server.  After using it, the server came back to take it away to give to another table.  Another reviewer pointed this out.  Apparently, olive oil is scarce?  Or maybe I'll just ensure my girlfriend brings one of her larger purses so we can sneak in our own bottle.  Jeez!  We ordered the Tortellini Panna Prosciutto and Chicken Della Casa.  The Tortellini was okay, but something seemed way off on the chicken.  Whatever cheese they used on the chicken completely overtook the entire entree.  The Tortellini was a little better.  For sides, we ordered mashes potatoes, which were essentially just that. I guess I was expecting at least a little flare?  Maybe we've been spending too much time in steakhouses?  I also ordered a polenta, which I absolutely loathed.  Although I take responsibility for that one, due to our mutual hatred of gorgonzola cheese    For dessert, they appear to have a combination of Pomo desserts, along with some that aren't available on the Pomo menu.  Not that it should make a difference since they're in the same location, right?  Anyway, we opted for the Lava del Vesuvio.  It ended up being embarrassingly small and something we finished off in a matter of seconds.       Since we didn't finish our food, we asked for a box.  The serve put up a big stink about us taking the bread with us.  Apparently, it's only for the restaurant.  Seriously?  What are they going to do?  Take it back into the kitchen so they can re-serve it to another customer?  Ultimately, we escaped with the stolen slices of bread, as the server suggested we just slip it into our box - but he assured us that he would take no responsibility if the manager caught us burgling his bread.    We came here in July and there's been several good reviews since then, so we might give it a second chance when a pasta mood strikes us and we don't feel like driving further south.  But unless they've made some significant improvements, I can't really make a recommendation at this point.

We're all for trying new locally owned pizza places.  Although considering some of the best locally owned establishments are within a 3 mile radius of this place, I've become somewhat concerned that an oversaturation will inevitably take place.  In regards to Forno301, I was quite surprised that I've driven by this little eatery many times. If you blink, you'll miss it, as it doesn't quite stand out amongst the other buildings in this neighborhood.  The set-up and ambiance kind of reminds me of Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana, sans their bizarre obsession with 90s R&B music playlists.  We opted to start with a Bruchette that featured burrata, tomato, and basil.  I've never been a big fan, as I feel that quality bread needs nothing more than a bit of oil olive to be truly appreciated.  Nevertheless, it was actually decent, even though we both agreed that we've had far superior burrata at Scotto in Los Angeles last summer.  For pizzas, we chose a standard Margherita as a baseline and the Testosterone, which features one of the most underutilized ingredients on a wood-fired pie (the fried egg).  While the ingredients aren't quite up to par with what I've had at other places, they were passable.  What really turned us off, however, was the crust.  As another reviewer pointed out, the crust seems to take on this bizarre flavor of a saltine cracker.  Airless, crunchy, and offensively salty.  Initially, I didn't mind it, but its novelty (which I'm pretty sure is unintentional) wore off very quickly.  For dessert, we opted to split the chocolate cake.  The size itself was the equivalent of those Little Debbie brownies AFTER you cut them in half!  In fact, a dried out brownie is essentially the best way to describe their version of "cake."  It's not even worth your time.  Maybe I would have went a little easier on this place if it wasn't for their abysmal service.  Some of the worst we've ever experienced (and we dine out 3-4 times a week!).  The restaurant was by no means crowded.  There were maybe four tables with customers, including two guys at the bar.  There were three or four employees that were constantly zipping by, never checking up on us and never offering refill our drinks.  When our pizzas were served, I was not provided a clean plate, so I had to physically snatch one myself from their stash.  I'm still not sure who our server was, as they all seemed to in a constant, but highly disorganized rotation.  When it came time for the bill, we waited and waited.  People kept walking past us, but no bill was provided.  In fact, waiting for the bill actually look just as long as placing our orders, waiting, and ultimately eating/finishing our food!  We were just sitting there, looking increasingly annoyed, and absolutely no one seemed to pay attention, despite not being busy at all.  Are you serious?    Generally, I like to visit a pizzeria at least twice before posting an honest review, but this is one instance where we have absolutely no intention of ever returning.  I'm sorry, but I can list at least five pizzerias within walking distance of this place that absolutely excel in both their food, and more importantly, the quality of the service provided.    We won't be back - and I'm fairly certain that based on how preoccupied their staff was - they will neither notice nor care.

We've always been huge fans of Preston's sister restaurant, Arrowhead Grill.  Unfortunately, since they were booked up for New Year's Eve, we decided to head over to Scottsdale and give Preston's a try.  We assumed that the experience would be equivalent.  If you're familiar with Arrowhead Grill, you'll find that the menu at Preston's Steakhouse is very similar in terms of what they offer.  Many of the entrees and sides are identical, including a few unique additions, such as their red velvet variation on AG's signature butter cake.  I was initially surprised that Preston's only has a 3.5 star average, with most people citing poor customer service as their main issue. Unfortunately, it didn't take us very long to realize that these reviewers were spot-on.  I'll start with the good:  Our server was very friendly and the food itself was excellent.  I wouldn't expect anything less.  The Delmonico steak has always been one of my favorite cuts of meat, with superb artisan mac and cheese and Yukon gold mashed potatoes as great side additions.  Although admittedly, I was a little disappointed that the far, far superior cheese and bacon infused mashed potatoes found on their AG menu were conspicuously absent.    I also saw many parties ordering their amazing butter cake for dessert.  Although we didn't order the original version at this location, I can assure you that it's, without a doubt, something that everyone must try at least once.  Now, for the bad:  Preston's is in a much larger space than AG, which includes multiple rooms, fireplaces, and a second floor patio. When crowded, the place can get extremely loud and could desperately use some type of sound paneling treatment.  We could barely have a conversation.  The place just seemed way too noisy and frantic for a fine-dining atmosphere, which we've never found to be an issue at Arrowhead.  What's up with serving sodas in miniature aluminum bottles in an upscale restaurant?  It's a cheap tactic that allows them to get away with charging for refills - and the soda only fills 3/4 of the glass!  You want more?  Then you'll get double-charged!  Seriously?  When we were seated at our table, my girlfriend thought something was odd about her chair.  It wasn't until 15 minutes had passed that a bus boy did a double-take, mumbling something to her, while then reaching behind her back and dramatically yanking out a giant server tray that was somehow lodged between her back and the chair's backrest.  It's as if he were performing some type of magic trick.  Why was there a tray lodged in her chair?  No idea.  But the bus boy deserves credit for noticing something that everyone else (including us) failed to catch.   The complimentary basket of bread that is always served BEFORE the meal took forever to come out.  In fact, after 40 minutes, we had to flag down our server and request the bread.  It was finally delivered to us, while our food was brought out literally seconds after.  That's not the way it's supposed to be done.   We decided to try their red velvet variation of their classic butter cake, as we knew it's unlikely that we'd ever return to this location again.  It ended up tasting like regular red velvet cake, as the velvet completely overtakes the buttery flavoring that makes the original so great.  My advice: stick to the regular one.  I can at least confidently vouch for it!  While the food here is very good, I agree with other reviews who say they lack in customer service.  The place just seemed very disorganized and lacking in efficiency, which probably isn't going to go over well with the clientele in this area.    We'll always love Arrowhead Grill for their food quality and excellent customer service, but Preston's has way too many issues to warrant a repeat visit.  Big disappointment!

We stopped by here on a whim on a random Thursday night and expected nothing beyond a generic pizza experience. In the end, we were pleasantly surprised with what this recently opened place has to offer!  What immediately grabbed our attention is the friendliness of the Australian staff that run Base.  While servers in most restaurants seem to be running on auto-pilot, the people we spoke to were extremely pleasant and genuinely seemed very enthusiastic about the food they're providing. They focus very heavily on using local sourcing and strongly emphasizing the organic aspects of their food.  We've been here on two separate occasions. Both times, we started with their Toasted Organic Bread, which definitely didn't disappoint. They told me their source and I forget the exact name, but they clearly chose very wisely.  For our first visit, we ordered The Base (Margherita) and The Piggy, which features the ever-so-popular prosciutto and parmesan combination. The second time, we ordered the El Diablo, which features some spicy soppressata with olives and The Chook, which includes organic chicken thigh and potato. All of their pizzas use ingredients that are very high quality.  I really like that they have a variety of spice-infused olive oils available at varying levels of intensity.  Their pizza is good, but what keeps it from being great, is their crust's lackluster texture.  It's a little on the hard/dry side, which seems to be a common complaint.   Ah... now for the dessert. For the first visit, we ordered their Nutella pizza. With this, you're essentially getting another pizza that features Nutella, walnuts, and banana slices. The end result is absolutely fabulous and if available, is definitely something you must order.  Unfortunately, the dessert is rarely available due to the time involved in preparing it.  In fact, I'm not even sure if it's ever available anymore.  For the second visit, we would have ordered this again. Since it was unavailable, we opted for a café affogato, which consists of organic ice cream, espresso, and some delicious biscotti which they also source out. Once again, they managed to impress us with an affogato that exceeds the one we've occasionally ordered at Pomo in Downtown Phoenix. Their biscotti was some of the best we've ever had!  We'll definitely go back and try some of their other pizzas and appetizers very soon. The atmosphere is warm, their foods are delicious, and the people are some of the nicest restaurant owners you'll encounter.  Highly recommended!

Since roughly 80% of Phoenix seems to be from Chicago (and will remind you of this regularly), I'm not surprised that yet another popular Chicago-based chain would target Phoenix as part of an expansion plan. The other I'm referring to is Portillo's, of course.    Initially, I knew that during the first few weeks, this place would be a complete zoo.  My girlfriend and I decided to wait a few weeks for the buzz to die down.  Even so, despite the fact that we dine out in Phoenix quite regularly, I don't think I've ever experienced a crowd like this without visiting a theme park.  Total madness!  You're allowed to pre-order your pizza while you're waiting, which allegedly will cut down on your wait time.  They also use a clever little app, which allows you to frequently check your place in the queue.  I must say, this is a very good approach to have.  Although since the front portion of the restaurant is basically a bar, it's kind of hard to distinguish between those people standing in line versus those who are just standing around.  In regards to deep dish pizza, Phoenix currently doesn't really offer many options.  Locally-based chain Oregano's serves an average version, while a local hole-in-the-wall called Vito's offers one that's far better.  However, Lou's has often been said to be the "gold standard" of deep dish pizza, so obviously expectations were pretty high going in.  They have both patio and indoor seating, but it becomes fairly obvious that they need much more dining space than they currently offer.  The whole bar area is wasted space and I feel they underestimated the amount of people in Phoenix that would dine here.  Our wait time was exactly two hours on an early Saturday evening.  Our server, who was friendly, confirmed our pre-order of a large pepperoni deep dish.  In the meantime, we ordered their three cheese bread.  The bread was actually decent.  A big, long slice served with a generous portion of sauce.  We were both pleased by its taste and the quality of the sauce, bread, and cheeses. , The pizza, which we timed, took exactly sixty minutes.  Therefore, I'm pretty sure that pre-ordering makes minimal difference in wait time.  When it was finally brought out to us, it didn't take us very long to conjure up a solid opinion.  The cheese, sauce, and pepperoni were all great quality. The crust, however, which I consider to be the heart of a great pizza, was extremely lackluster.  It was very crunchy, had zero flavor, and offered absolutely no moisture or flakiness that I've come to expect from a well made deep dish.  Both of us were kind of in utter shock.  I mean, if this is what the people of Chicago consider to be an ideal version of deep dish pizza, then their standards are much lower than I originally thought.  If there was, in fact, butter flavor in the crust, it was virtually undetectable.      The question is, was our pizza simply a botched pie or is this standard procedure?  Unfortunately, that's something we'd have to return for in order to determine.  For dessert, we split a pizza cookie.  We've had some pretty decent pizza cookies at other local establishments, so we assumed this one would be on par.  Most restaurants only partially bake the cookie, giving it a lovely gooey texture.  Our cookie was literally stuck to the pan, which you had to dig to even find due to the excessive amounts of ice and whipped cream they use on top.  In the end, we were disappointed - which rarely happens when it comes to anything related to cookies.  I'll give them an extra star due to their food prices being reasonable, the portions being generous, and the server being polite. And if the pizza were amazing, I'd easily forgive the long wait times.  But this is one situation where I simply can't give out a high rating for a pizza joint that can't get their crust right.  We might come back at some point, but with so many great options for pizza in Central Phoenix, I doubt it'll be anytime soon.  Not recommended.

Imagine the original Matt's Big Breakfast, only in a slightly smaller setting. The menu is the same, the food is the same, and the service is the same. The only difference?  Now, you actually have a place to park your damned car!  We've been waiting on this Matt's location to open for quite some time to the point where they were so far past their originally projected launch date that I had almost forgotten about it.  And then, just on a whim, browsing through Yelp, I noticed that it had quietly opened its doors back in January.    Honestly, there isn't really anything I can say about Matt's that I didn't say in my review of the original location.  The breakfast served here is what I consider to be the gold standard.  It's traditional breakfast food that thrives on simplicity, without the need to be annoyingly trendy with stupid gimmicks like 500 different types of omelets or offering up liquor at 7am in the morning.  Keep it simple, keep it good, and ultimately, you don't need all that other crap to keep customers coming back for more.  Now, if you're used to only going to breakfast places that offer a Bible-sized menu of dishes to select from, this might not be the place for you.  In my opinion, you really can't go wrong with anything, including the thick cuts of peppered bacon, butter-infused hash browns, homemade jam, and various honey lemonades and orange juice.  The quality of the food at this location is consistent with what we've come to expect.  If you come during busy weekend hours, don't expect the addition of an extra location to have an impact on wait times.  It's just one of those things that we've all learned to tolerate.  Good food can't always be kept secret, unfortunately.  In some ways, I do see this location as kind of an odd choice.  It's not really very far from the other Matt's, so it's not like anyone is pocketing all this extra gas money by going here instead of downtown.  But in the end, who really cares?  Matt's could open up a location at the bottom of a tar pit and I'd still give them five stars for the food alone.

Several years ago, Chris Bianco opened up a little trattoria in Town and Country known as Italian Restaurant.  The concept was made clear, but largely due to his reputation as a pizza chef, it never really found its feet.  The eatery eventually morphed into a hybrid Italian Restaurant/Pizzeria Bianco location, until ultimately becoming a second Pizzeria Bianco with an expanded menu.      In many ways, I feel that this is what Italian Restaurant would have been if things had panned out as originally planned.  With this in mind, don't go in here expecting to find any pizza on the menu.  In fact, the only similarities this place shares with its neighboring restaurant are the bread, drink options, and some familiar faces on staff.  Although the restaurant may be described as one that stands on its own, I still find that its vibe is consistent with the other locations.  There's a rustic/industrial feel that I've always found is a great contrast to the current obsession of restaurants looking like the owner robbed an IKEA.  If you plan on going here, I suggest making a reservation.  Even on the weekdays.  My girlfriend and I are so used to just strolling into Pizzeria Bianco and being seated immediately on Thursday nights, that we were surprised to find that they were booked solid during our attempted second visit.  We had to plan accordingly for the following week.  If you've sampled some of the market pastas at the neighboring restaurant, you'll quickly learn that Bianco does far, far more than just bake pizza.  We went in with extremely high expectations and those expectations were most definitely met!  For both visits, we started with their familiar bread and olive oil, which never disappoints.  For appetizers, we've tried both the farinata, which is similar to a potato pancake.  Additionally, we've had some locally sourced melon.  Both were excellent, as expected!    Pastas tend to vary, but we've yet to try a bad one here.  A pork shank that we ordered during our initial visit just slid right off the bone and was as tender and juicy as could be.  You really can't do it any better!  For desserts, we've tried a dark chocolate gelato and their unique take on tiramisu.  This tiramisu uses sponge cake instead of ladyfingers.  The result is a much welcomed modification in what I usually consider to be a highly overrated and played out dessert.    Well done!  Prices are a little higher than what you might be used to.  The vibe is slightly more upscale, but not to the point where I'd call it a "fancy" restaurant.  I predict many good things for Tratto in the future.  And while Pizzeria Bianco will always be our favorite, this is a great place to visit if you want to take things up a notch!  Highest recommendation!
