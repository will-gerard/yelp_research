My husband and I were fortunate enough to be invited to a wedding at this beautiful venue last weekend.  Driving up the mountainside, you reach this beautiful building with incredible city and mountain views.  Due to the rain on Friday and Saturday morning, they had to move the ceremony inside, but it worked out perfectly.  The mansion was decorated for Christmas and it was so lovely.    After the ceremony, the doors opened to the reception room that included floor to ceiling windows so that the views and sunset could be taken in by everyone.  The tables were set beautifully with gold chargers and nice silver.  The appetizers served during the cocktail hour were all delicious especially the quiche and the tomato and mozerrella crackers.  The bar was prompt and the dinner of beef tenderloin was great.    Make sure you check out all of the decor if you make it up to the mansion.  The Wrigley's were definitely not minimalists!

Wonderful fine dining experience with an old school feel.  Best wine list EVER!  While the food was delicious, it was somewhat uninspired.  I enjoyed the experience more than the food.

This rating is on a scale of fast food restaurants and on that scale, Rubio's is pretty much top notch.  The fish tacos are delicious and the sauces are all tasty, especially the verde salsa...yummy.  There are not too many "healthy" options that are that tasty, but it definitely beats the fattiness of Baja Fresh any day.  If we are in a hurry and in an area with Rubio's, it is my pick.  It would be so much better if Texas was invaded by Rubio's instead of Taco Del Mar.

This restaurant knows exactly how to make your tastebuds dance.  The food was top notch and the service, impeccible.  The duck and foie gras...to die for.  Our server was so great and offered the perfect suggestions.  We had polished off our bottle of wine before dessert and I hesitantly declined an after dinner drink.  The waiter must of sensed this because upon my return from the ladies room to our table my husband informed me that our server brought me a complimenary drink.    The ambience was romantic and I hope to return soon.

With an Irish Mexican name like Carlos O'Brien's, you really never know what you are getting yourself into.  After trying to find some good queso in the Valley with very little success, I finally found the good stuff at Carlos O'Brien's.  It was delicious.  Apparently queso is not a big thing in the Southwest, but us Texans live for it.    The food and chips and salsa were also very good.  My fajita chicken quesadillas had cheese oozing out of the sides of the tortillas and big fresh peppers.  The margaritas were also quite tasty.  I was so full I felt like I needed my husband to roll me out the door.

Smoky smoke smoke...that is pretty much all I remember.  I don't care how "chill" and laid back this bar is.  I think I lost three years of my life by going here one night.  Mixed crowd, pitchers of beer, oh, and some serious cigarette smoke.

I love breakfast and after a night of catching up with old friends and staying up way too late, we ventured over to Crackers.  We were seated fairly quickly and the service was prompt and friendly.  The atmosphere is cafeteria-like with outdated decor.  However, the menu has all of the regular breakfast offerings and then some.  I went with the Farmer's skillet and it was great.  My only complaint is that the potatoes were not crispy enough for my liking, but all in all, the flavors were good and it hit the spot.  Next time,  I think I will go with the Vatican, which got good reviews from one dining companion.  The only real negative was that the tortilla that came with the huevos rancheros was a little hard.  All in all, this is a good breakfast stop for the basics in a secluded strip mall behind the Home Depot.

For full disclosure, it has been a while since I have been here, however, I do remember the meal being fantastic.  The mussels in white wine sauce were a dream, but too huge for two of us to share as an appetizer.  My veal with capers and lemon sauce was great, but a little tart.  Overall, this was an enjoyable dining experience with great food.   The service was spectacular and the old-school feel of this Italian bistro makes it worth a visit.  The atmosphere is very low-key, but still elegant.  Your date will surely be pleased with this pick.

Solely based on the grounds and the bar, I give Gainey Ranch five stars.  It is a gorgeous and fun place to have drinks and walk around.  The landscaping and layout are well done, but I particularly like the open air seating when the weather is nice.  The atmosphere is lively but grown-up.  Although I am typically a grey goose and soda girl, I will venture out for their apple-tini because it is so refreshing (and strong)!  This is a great alternative to the bar scene and a perfect place for intimate after dinner cocktails or to meet friends for a rowdy evening at the bar.    Update:  Finally stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch.  Although the rooms are average, the resort is so wonderful, it is still five stars in my book.  They do need to update the rooms a bit as we saw a visible water leak.  However, the beds were incredibly comfy and the big deck for sunbathing was nice.  I officially have a new favorite cocktail - the pomegranate mojito.  We had some cocktails and appetizers at the bar and again were so overjoyed by the fantastic views.

I thought my 100th review here on Yelp should be somewhere special so I chose this amazing place.  If you have a chance to escape to far North Scottsdale and stay at the Fours Seasons at Troon North, then take advantage of that chance.  We spent an evening escaping the summer heat a bit because it is high enough in elevation to get cooler nights.  We enjoyed a couples massage which was incredible.  Then, we ate some appetizers and drank $13 margaritas at the pool bar.  But hell, who cares about the price of the margarita when you are enjoying yourself so darn much?  Our casita was lovely and felt very private, even though we did have neighbors.  The view of the grounds was pretty although the city views from other parts of the resort are just fantastic.  We ate dinner at their fine dining restaurant, Acacia, and enjoyed drinks on the patio after dinner.  The service was top notch at the entire resort from the sweet tea that greets you in the lobby at check-in to the spa, pool bar, and fine dining experience...all were outstanding.  This was a memorable 24 hour escape for us, but I would love to hole up at this Four Seasons for a lot longer.

Boar's Head meat and thick toasted bread make these sandwiches some of my favorite.  The soups are okay, but put them in a fresh bread bowl and who cares?  The Southwestern Club is my fave with the tasty raspberry mustard.  The sandwiches are huge but they are so good you may not be able to stop after half of one.  The shop itself takes the minimalist approach so don't expect any fancy decor.

Nello's has delicious pizza!  I have yet to find pizza in Dallas that has Chicago-like crust and a plethora of toppings like Nello's.  If this review were solely based on the pizza, then Nello's would receive five stars.  However, the salads are lacking in variety and the atmosphere is cafeteria-like.  That being said, I look forward to our next trip to Phoenix and I am sure Nello's will be on our short list.

It took us over an hour to get a rental car because there were only three employees working the desk on a Friday evening.  Isn't that supposed to be one of the busiest travel times?  Instead of apologizing, the manager said, "you don't complain when you have to wait at the airport check-in, do you?"  As far as I know, those are two completely different industries and Hertz is in the business of customer service.  Had we not prepaid, we would have gone to another company.  You cannot do that with airlines...they have monopolies on different routes.  Idiot, I tell you.    Anyway, once we get assigned a car, we go down to the garage and the car is not there.  Finally, we got someone in the Gold Club area to help us and we ended up with a nice upgrade.  I would have rather had the Kia and an hour of my life back!

I am not a dance club person at all.  Seriously, unless forced or obligated for a bachelorette party, I don't do clubs.  Six is a great alternative to the club scene.  Cool lounge atmosphere with great music and good drinks.  The down side is all the people doing ecstasy, drinking water.  I prefer the drunks to the druggies.  However, it is a cool place to mingle in Scottsdale.

In the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, Los Olivos delivers Mexican food with an old style flair.  The decor is festive and the some of the waitstaff appear to have been working there forever.  First of all, they serve two distinct salsas.  I am not a fan of the enchilada type hot sauce, which is an Arizona thing, but the other salsa is fresh and full of onions, tomato and cilantro.  It tastes as though it is made right before it is brought to the table...so fresh.  We had to ask for a bowl for the salsa, which is apparently not normal at Los Olivos, but we were making a mess trying to use our little plates for the chips and salsa.   I ordered a combo plate and my husband ordered the enchiladas.  The flavor was delicious and much like Tex-Mex, which is my favorite.  The margaritas were also great.  The prices are reasonable and truly, this is the best Mexican food I have found in Arizona.  They offer fajita meat dishes, which is a rarity.    Los Olivos was packed at 6:30pm when we grabbed dinner and we quickly learned why.  It has been around for decades and has earned a reputation for great Mexican food.

Great atmosphere, good sushi and a perfect way to kick off an evening on the town.  Ra is fun with groups, big or small.  Also, a good date spot if you don't mind how loud it is, even with the attractive waitstaff.  Worth a short wait, just grab a drink and check out all of the new colagen and botox.  It can be quite entertaining.

Jalapeno cornbread....yummmmmy.   Known for rotiserrie chicken and it is quite good and so is the rest of the menu.  I could get full on the cornbread and be fat and happy and ready to go.  There usually tends to be a wait on the weekends and last time we learned that no hats were allowed in the dining room.  A little stiff for a rotiserrie restaurant but it is still delish.

Love the salsa, which is always a good indicator about whether or not the food will be worth the calories at a Mexican food restaurant.  It had a little kick and some pickled jalapenos mixed in to give it a distinct flavor.  The chili con queso also had a chipotle flavor, which was killer.  The food was very good and we were extremely full and satisfied at the end of our meal.  I was so full that I could not take advantage of the free sopapillas.  I never expect much for service at chain restaurants; however, this was an exception to the rule.  Our waiter was awesome.  He was on top of everything, including the five diet cokes we each drank (hungover).  Being a fan of Tex-Mex, this restaurant satisfies that aspect as well as New Mexican style.

Divey pub with a decent atmosphere.  A little too smokey for my taste and the beer selection on tap is nothing to brag about.  The crowd was a combination of skater types and preppy types.  It was interesting but not that exciting.

Such a great little shop with delicious sandwiches - fresh bread and flavorful meats.  Just tell them exactly what you want and they will make it to go or you can pull up a chair and eat inside.  The service is super friendly, and the grocery section is small, but inventive.

Yummy nachos, good local brew, and a cool, laid-back atmosphere.  One of the few places in Tempe I really enjoy.  While I still feel old at times, it is not nearly as overrun by college students as the bars near campus...like Maloney's.  This is a great place to kick back under the misters and enjoy a cold beer on a hot summer day.

Good standard breakfast fare near Mill Avenue.  The menu is full of all the usual suspects...omelets, bacon and eggs, breakfast burritos, etc.  Very cozy, extremely laid-back atmosphere.  Feels like a place you can roll out of bed and walk in without worrying that you have mascara all over your face.  Reminds me a bit of Austin, TX and that is a very good thing.

Even in the 110 degree weather, I do not mind waiting underneath the misters to grab some grub at Oreganos.  Okay, maybe that is a bit of a stretch, but just drink a few beers and your table should be ready.  The thin crust pizza is worth the wait...a reasonable wait, that is.  But the pizookie (huge deep-dish cookie topped with ice cream) is probably worth the unreasonable waits that haunt this pizza joint.  Oreganos is definitely a Valley treat and they cover the Italian basics better than most.

My husband calls this "male onlys" for the 10 to 1 ratio of guys to girls at this bar.  I call it the "I am way too old to be here because I stopped using a fake ID years ago" bar.  It is a haven for ASU students and graduates that can't give up the college life.  The five dollar big beers and classic movie clips are the two stars for this bar.

Big bar in the heart of Tempe.  The guys tend to love it for the cheap Corona.  I like it for the atmosphere so long as it is not too packed with underaged college kids.  It is a pretty open space and it almost feels like you are in a warehouse.  The bartenders have heavy hands, which is always a plus when you are a vodka person, like I am.  Great place to go hang with your friends in your flip flops and tees.  Cool, chill, laid-back...just like I like it.

It seems as though my experience at Caffe Boa was better than average.  We went on a slow night so we did not have a hectic dining experience.  Instead, we got personal attention with great suggestions.  It has been a while, so I do not remember exactly what I had but I know it was a delicious pasta dish that I consumed.  I will be sure and hit it up again when I am in town to give it a proper food review.

Huge patio where the beer flows like wine.  Oh, and the vodka cocktails are good too.  Very laidback atmosphere and perfect for groups.  Mixed crowd, from preppy to pierced and tattooed.  Can be a little bit of a young crowd but not as annoying as many other ASU bars.  Never have had the food, but have always had a great time.    Only downside is that it gets crowded, very, very crowded.    Update:  Minus one star.  Way too much patchouli.  I am too old for that nonsense.  However, still had a good time with friends.  The scene was a lot more rough this time around.  Without tattoos, we stood out like sore thumbs.

Seriously, how could you give this airport a good review?  Even if they had blackjack tables at the gates, I don't think I could.  Make sure you wear you walking shoes and don't carry anything too heavy because it takes about an hour to get from ticketing to the terminal. We learned the hard way and spent 24 hours at the airport after we missed our flight.      The floors are really hard to sleep on too!  Man cannot live on Sbarro and Cinnabon alone.     Although people say that this is one of the BUSIEST airports in the country,  somehow the much, much busier airports, such as DFW, Phx Sky Harbor, and Chicago O'Hare have learned how to make the terminals much more accessible.  Walking is not a problem, but the fact that everything is so spread out makes travelling in and out of this airport a nightmare, especially if you have children or are with someone who is elderly.

This is by far the best formal dining experience we have had in Vegas and arguably one of the better meals we have had in the past year.  When you walk in, the view is stunning and we were fortunate enough to get a window table.  When you make a reservation, ask for a table by the window on the West side of the building because those are the best views of the entire strip.  The atmosphere is very romantic with dim lighting, windows across every wall and dark wood booths with red cushions.  The service was spectacular for the most part.  While the sommelier was helpful, he was a bit of a snob when we chose a lowly $175 bottle of wine.  It was completely overpriced and we were not going to spend more than that because the markup was about 500%.  Ridiculous.  However, we did not let his little attitude ruin our evening and the rest of the staff was so wonderful.  I love that the main courses are brought out under silver domes and removed at the same time.  It entertains me everytime!  The amuse bouche was a wonderful pasta with smoked salmon and prosciutto.  As a starter, I ordered the scallops and my husband ordered the French onion soup.  The soup was some of the best but the scallops were the best scallops we have ever put in our mouths.  I had a completely different experience than Cynthia because these scallops were plump and fresh with a delicious accent of bacon and scallions, but I cannot remember the sauce.  They were the best.  Then, my husband had the green peppercorn filet and I had the duck.  The filet was delicious and the duck was very well prepared.  The duck included a puff pastry with peaches and foie gras on top.  Yum.  Although we sufficiently stuffed ourselves, we continued on with the beignets for dessert and they were a divine, sweet finish to an inspiring meal.  After having a few disappointing meals in Vegas, this was definitely a turning point and a high standard of dining on or off the strip.

We stayed here for part of our trip because it was free and easy access for my conference at the Flamingo (and much nicer than the Flamingo).  While it is "off" the strip, it is so close that it is faster to walk to the strip than it is to get through other massive hotels and onto the strip.  Our room was very nice, very Westin-ish, with nice decor, heavenly bed, and remodeled bathroom.  We even got a rubber duck to take home to our dog.    The hotel was quiet which is a nice change from the hustle and bustle of the strip.  Honestly, except for the fact that the guy checking us in had no idea what he was doing, no real complaints.  We did not have problems with the elevators...apparently, they have been (or are in the process of being) upgraded.    The casino is not happening but take a walk or hop in a quick cab and you will be in the middle of everything.  Note - did not check out the restaurant, spa, or pool.  However, there is a Starbucks in the Lobby, which saved my life for this early morning conference.

Being from Texas, I am a fan of Tex-Mex which believe it or not, is hard to find in these parts.  Although not Tex-Mex, I had high hopes for Los Dos because of the rave reviews of my husband's friends and family.  Everyone was promising me this would be a break from the disappointing Mexican food I had tried in the valley.  So, off we go...and what a let down.  The food was okay, but definitely not all it was hyped up to be.  I love mouth scorching spicy food but you get the impression that the dishes have no flavor because of the overwhelming spicy flavor is all you can taste.  The service was virtually non-existant and we got the impression that we were a burden to the waitstaff by dining there.  So, the search continues...

After reading the reviews on Yelp, my expectations were not exceedingly high but I knew that deep down inside I wanted to try this place.  When we got there on Saturday night, there was a short wait, so we decided to sit at the bar.  Great decision.  The bartender was so incredibly nice (and looked like a prettier version of Jennifer Lopez).  She served up our beverages and promptly took our orders.  I ordered the buffalo burger with grilled onions, portobello mushrooms, and pepper jack cheese.  My husband ordered the grilled chicken sandwich w/ pepper jack and grilled onions.  We shared the sweet potato fries.  My buffalo burger was amazing.  I wanted to eat the whole thing but had to resist since I knew it was not in my best interest.  It was juicy and full of flavor.  I was surprised how generous they were with the portobellos, since it was only a dollar addition.  My husband raved about the chicken sandwich, too.  The sweet potato fries were killer.  They were the best sweet potato fries because they had the perfect consistency of crispiness and potato softness on the inside.    I highly recommend sitting at the bar and grabbing burgers and drinks anytime you are in Vegas.  We seriously could have split one and probably will next time.  Sit at the bar and the service will be great, too.

Caveat - This review is for brunch only.  We were pleased to see that we gained some comps at Ceasar's and headed over to Mesa Grill for some free brunch.  The decor is modern and bright with primary colors decorating the bar and more subtle hues throughout the dining room.  Our waitress was prompt in every way.  She brought us the delicious bread basket, which included a piece of Mesa Grill's cinammon roll, some jalapeno biscuits, and yellow and blue cornbread muffins.    My hubby and I ordered the same dish - the spicy scrambled eggs.  The fluffy eggs came mixed with jalapenos, goat cheese, and green onions, and were topped with apricot glazed ham.  They were served with two wonderful buttermilk biscuits.  The goat cheese and jalapenos combined for the perfect explosion of flavor without either flavor overwhelming the dish.  I am not usually a ham person, but this ham was top notch.  I think we will add Mesa Grill's brunch to our regular stops when we are in LV.  It was really that good.

I don't know why I love these suites so much, since we spend so little time in our rooms.  However, all of the rooms at the Venetian are quite large and feel so homey.  I particularly love the large bathrooms because there is nothing better than a hot shower in a luxurious setting to wake yourself up or wash off that Vegas stinch.    Also, the Venetian has a great selection of restaurants and shops, although the casino continues to take my money from me.

Don't get me wrong by the lack of a fifth star, I really, really loved dining at Delmonico's.  I thought the service was extremely attentive (truly some of the best service I have had) and food was great.  I would definitely return and I am sure we would have another wonderful dining experience.  However, I have had better steaks so I cannot rank this as the best of the best.  On the other hand, this is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Vegas and would definitely give it two thumbs up and recommend it to those staying at the Venetian.

For $300 a night, you would think that you could get a remodeled room with a King bed.  Incorrect, my friend.  Instead, you get a crappy, dark, old, stinky room in the pyramid with crap growing around the sink and a scary plastic shower stall.  I, mark my words, will never stay in this dump again as long as I live.  First of all, the check-in is ridiculous.  There are apparently something like 3000 rooms in this place.  Yet, they only have about 8 people checking people in.  Can you see where that might be a problem?  Fortunately, my hubby showed up 30 minutes before check-in while I was in a conference, so he was able to get close to the front.  The rest of the time we were there (including 1am), there were people waiting to check-in.  Nightmare.    The Inclinator (elevator) is not for the weak at heart.  Seriously, it is an interesting experience.  Wikipedia just told me that it travels up the pyramid at a 39 degree angle...hence the reason it feels like you are going to fall down the entire time you are riding it.    Needless to say, I do not like this place.  There is no real redeeming quality...so one star it is.  Other Yelp reviews say the remodeled rooms are great.  Hmmm...I cannot see them being worth the price of a room at the Venetian.

Have not stayed here but after my experience, I never would.  Have never been treated more like dirt in my life.  Dealers were asses and so we went back to the Venetian, where we were staying, to blow our money and hang with the nicest dealers in town.  Do not spend you money in this terrible excuse for a casino.  Go where the dealers are friendly and it is a much better experience.

I describe Olives as a huge disappointment.  It has the formula to be a great restaurant.  There are friendly hostesses seating you on time for your reservation in a beautifully appointed dining room, a nice drink/wine list, and an interesting menu.  However, the execution is terrible or at least it was for our dinner experience on a Friday night.  First of all, we were seated or crammed into a table about a foot and a half away from people on each side.  Second, we did not get our drinks for fifteen minutes and did not even get water for ten.  When our waiter finally appeared, he told us how busy he was and tried to get sympathy because some old man was demanding.  Okay, we gave him the benefit of the doubt until I asked him a question about the menu and his answer was, "You know, I am going to have come back because I really need to wait on that table."  So much for us sitting there not being helped for fifteen minutes...ugh.  With regards to the food, it was above average.  The bread and olive tapenade was commendable.  The boston bibb salad fell in the alright category.  The true winner for us was the portobello flatbread.  I can imagine that if I would have had a salad and flatbread for lunch, I would probably be writing a much better review.  Then, my husband had the risotto special and I had the halibut.  The fish was flaky and quite tasty, but I could not even dent it, it was so large.  The risotto was undercooked and lacked pizazz.  All in all, a disappointing experience and not one living up to the name or price of Todd English.  I think it is time for him to drop in on his Vegas restaurant to see how things are going.

Although I am not sure it is worth the hour wait, I loved the concept.  The burger was delicious, but the sweet potato fries were my favorite part.  The fries come in cute little mini shopping carts and I recommend going half and half w/ regular fries for the variety.  Yes, it is very trendy but we had a great time!  We split a salad and a burger so it is not too pricey if you go that way.  Also, they have a great variety of cocktails which left me very happy by the time we left.

I have to admit, I have been putting off this review.  I am not sure that my words can do this experience justice.  I almost feel like it is one of those "you have to try it to understand" spots.  The restaurant is extremely inviting and gorgeous.  Our waiter was Italian, which totally went with the theme of the night and gave you confidence that he communicated well with Mr. Bartolotta (who is actually in the kitchen).  My only complaint is that the sommilier was too busy.  There should have been more than one so that the wait for wine was not so long.  That is seriously my only complaint, which is not enough to take away from the food.  OMG, the FOOD!!!!!!  Okay, here is the deal - skip the salad and go straight for the pasta to share as an appetizer.  Get a big portion and pass it around the table.  It is not worth filling an ounce of your belly with lettuce because the pastas deliver.  We ordered the lasagnette con ragu di crostacei - "rags" of pasta, lobster, shrimp, langoustines, crab, white wine, tomato.  It is an open faced lagasna with fresh seafood fillings.  A serious fan favorite.  We also shared the ravioli di ricotta con caciotta Toscana sheep's milk ricotta ravioli, Tuscan pecorino cheese, Marsala wine glaze, which was super rich and delicious.  For dinner, we ordered the fresh fish.  We chose the Orata, which is light white fish and the salsa cruda, a tomato based sauce.  We split the fish among four of us.  We could not finish it.  It does not say on the menu, but the fresh fish option is served with fresh veggies and potatoes.  This is a lot of food but it is divine.  The fish was probably the best fish I have ever had.  Plus, watching them filet it tableside is an experience all of its own.    Yes, it is expensive, but this is Vegas and the Wynn...to quote Paula Abdoul, "it is what it is."  And, personally, I think it was worth every penny (even though I did not pay!).  This was a culinary highlight and I would highly recommend Bartolotta to anyone that does not mind forking over some serious cash for a sensational meal.

It is so nice in the hustle and bustle of Vegas to be able to walk up to a counter, pay a relatively inexpensive price (for Vegas standards) for some grub and receive the food within five minutes.  On top of that, these crepes are delish!      What my hubby and I have done is order one salty and one sweet crepe and split them.  I believe they refer to them as meal or dessert crepes...just get one of each.  They are huge but you need to try more than one of these fairly inventive recipes.  I have not made it here on my last two trips to Vegas but Yelp just reminded me to go back and grub.

It is pretty difficult to say more than has already been said by the great reviews.  I thought the show was fantastic.  The acrobatics were amazing and the incorporation of a pseudo story line kept you alert to the different areas of activity on the stage.  The diving is truly incredible and had me on the edge of my seat.  For the most part, the music was good but it gets a bit repetitive and would be better if there was something more familiar.  The choreography was remarkable and the set was unlike anything out there.  My only real complaint is the clowns.  I know that the performers have to rest and change clothes...but the clowns were boring.  It was funny the first couple times but by the end I was falling asleep during their sketches.  That needs some revamping.  All in all, I think it is worth the money and highly entertaining.  The Cirque shows are a Vegas must.  I thought Love was great and am looking forward to catching Mystere next time.

Disgusting...blah.  I am not real picky when it comes to casual restaurants.  But I have to admit, some of this food was barely edible.  The calamari was so chewy, it tasted like rubber.  The turkey burger ordered by one comrade came out pink.  That is a little scary since turkey really should be thoroughly cooked.  My eggplant ravioli was tolerable but made my husband gag.  One person ordered the pastrami sandwich and picked at it...and I have to say, we are not the kind to snub our noses at good sandwiches.  The only thing that was pretty good was the chicken pot pie.    On top of the nasty food, our waitress seemed completely stoned.  It took her 10 minutes to get us our drinks and she would disappear for several minutes at a time.  When we asked her questions, she had not clue what the answer was and had to go ask someone else.  Seriously incompetent.  So, my suggestion is to steer clear of this place.

Update - I had to reduce it to 2 stars.  I would never voluntarily go here and that is a pretty good test for me.  I would return to most of my three star reviews.  I have had a mental debate whether to give this place two stars or three.  For fear of getting flamed, I bumped up my 2.5 to 3.  I guess the main thing is that I just don't get this place.  We went for the early bird service at 5pm because we had a big group and it was tough to find parking.  People were already flowing out the front door waiting for tables.  My in-laws think Tia's has the best food, but my inclination is that Mesa just needs some more restaurants.  The chips are good and the salsa is average.  I don't really like it when salsa tastes like enchilada sauce and this is borderline.  I have been here 3 or 4 times and the only time I thought my meal was good to very good was the time I ordered fish tacos even though I usually do not like fruit in my Mexican food.  Due to the fact that everyone seems to love the food, I keep trying new things but am usually sorely disappointed.  This time, I had average tortilla soup and an average mini shrimp quesadilla (which was served open faced, unlike most quesadillas and sweet).  I guess I will stick to the fish tacos or try Andrew's suggestion of carne asada next time the in-laws want to hit up Tia Rosas.

Enjoyed the beautiful weather sitting on the terrace at the Wynn but our service was horrendous.  "I'll be right back" translated into "I'll be back in 15 minutes".  Same as "your order will be right out" meaning "I have not even put your order into the kitchen yet."  It took 35 minutes to get our food after we ordered it and the food was not that impressive.  My omelette was subpar, the hashbrowns were inedible and the french toast tasted almost burnt.  However, the black angus burger was delicious and after tasting my husband's burger I knew I made a mistake in ordering.  Don't go here if you are in a hurry and sit outside if the weather is nice so that at least the atmosphere will make up for the crappy service and mediocre food.

For some reason, we hit Phoenix on the first rainy day since October but that did not deter us from checking out Matt's Big Breakfast based on all the Yelp raves.  We had to wait outside for about 10-15 minutes in the rain, but finally got two seats at the bar.  When people describe this place as tiny, think 8 small tables and 6 bar stools tiny.  Do not try with groups...it will not work.  The waitress behind the counter was a riot telling people to "Smile, it's Christmas!"  She definitely kept the spirits up.  Our service was great, but we were at the counter where coffee was readily available.  First impression was that the coffee was great.  It is local, fresh and delicious.  My husband's waffle was really good but I won with the cheese omelette with mushrooms, onion and bacon.  It was full of gooey cheese and my husband helped me polish it off.  The hashbrowns were good, but a little greasy and the sourdough was perfect.    Bottom line - it is worth the trek downtown if you are on vacation or do not live downtown.  Good simple breakfast with plenty of butter for you arteries to soak up.

Great, divey Irish pub with live music and good beer on tap.  The beer menu is not as extensive as some places, but the laidback crowd, and cool atmosphere make up for that flaw.  We gathered here with a group of friends and had a great time and a lot of booze and our tab was super cheap.  Parking is a little scarce, but once you find a spot and step inside you can kick your feet up and have a jolly good time.  Cheers.    Only complaint is that there is not enough room by the band.  People try to crowd around and it is nearly impossible.

I will be the first to admit, we went here for lunch and this restaurant is probably more of a dinner stop.  So, keep that in mind with this review.  First and foremost, the food was excellent.  My spinach ravioli with garlic creme sauce was delightful.  It was very light on the cream and topped with sauteed spinach.  Highly recommended.  My husband's pasta dish was light and tasty but the butter sauce lacked a little flavor.  However, the smoked chicken and bowtie pasta were cooked to perfection.  The sourdough bread and flavored butter were also a nice touch.  The atmosphere is cool and the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food.  We have spent this much at crappy burger joints.  The bar is good looking and we enjoyed the openness of the restaurant.  Service was decent but it was almost as though we were in at an off time because our table was being covered by three or four different waiters/managers.  That did not really work for me.  I can imagine that dinner at Bloom is spectacular and I look forward to giving that a whirl.

Imagine...you walk into a restaurant.  All the waitstaff is dressed like they belong in the fifties with collared shirts, long khaki shorts, colored socks and loafers.  How could it get better than that?    Well, it does.  The skillets are the best I have ever had.  This whole in the wall, strip center joint is my favorite brunch place...and on the weekends, prepare to wait.  I have dined at the celebrity infused bruncheries in NYC, all the brunch places I can find in Dallas, but still no one can match the Eggington cajun potatoes.  They are perfectly crispy and have a little kick.  I have heard great things about the sandwiches and soups, but I always opt for breakfast when I am in the Valley.

Got a comped breakfast here before we left Vegas.  If I had to pay for it, I may have given it one star.  The service was SLOW.  We finally had to ask for our waitress because she was nowhere to be seen.  I had an egg white omellette and it tasted like pure butter.  It was edible, but not much more than that.   The hashbrowns were alright because there was enough crispiness to make them decent.  The best part was our stellar busboy.  He kept our Diet Cokes coming all meal long.  Unless it is free, I would pass on the Pyramid.

Hyatt just bought out Amerisuites and is converting all of these suite hotels into a contemporary concept called Hyatt Place.  We stayed at one of the first ones to open in Old Town Scottsdale.  It was a bargain at $109 a night.  The rooms have gone a full transformation including granite countertops and other decorative improvements along with a 42" plasma HDTV.  Our room was setup much like a loft and included the super comfortable Hyatt Grand Bed.  For the price, this hotel was great.  They offer 24 hour dining and free breakfast.  They were still working the kinks out with service being a little spotty.  Also, it is near a couple clubs so try and get a room away from the noise if possible.  It did not bother us, but I could see it being a potential problem.  Also, if you want a cab, you have to specify that you want them to call a cab.  Otherwise, they will call a towncar from Hyatt Gainey Ranch to come get you and charge you twice the price.

Thank you Total Rewards for getting me a day pass to this heavenly spa!  This is the greatest spa I have ever seen and I am so glad that we chose to use these passes.  This place is outrageous.  The roman baths are surrounded by warm stone loungers for relaxation and the tea room was wonderful.  The free (yeah!) beverages helped rehydrate me after killing my body the night before.  I consumed coffee, iced tea and lots of water.    My favorite part was going between the three rooms - cedarwood sauna, herbal steam sauna and the arctic ice room.  I started cold, went to hot in the cedarwood, then went to the steam to sweat out all of my impurities, back to cedarwood and then to cool off in the ice room.  The arctic ice room has a little button you can wave you hand over so that ice chips shoot out into a sink.  Then, you take the ice chips to exfoliate your skin.  I did not think I would love it, but I did.  It was so invigorating.    I am hoping Total Rewards hooks me up again but I would be willing to pay the $35 bucks for a pass to relaxation.  I am even tempted to get an outrageously expensive treatment sometime because this place was so great.

B&B seems to incite polarized opinions and I happy to say that I fall in the camp that had a great experience at B&B from the food to service to wine...almost everything was was spot on.  When we arrived, we were immediately seated at a table for two in the back corner.  I was not thrilled with the location but it ended up a good spot where you could see the action of the restaurant and the bar.  Honestly, service started a little slow but picked up and was great by the end.  The pacing was a little off, for instance we received our appetizer prior to receiving our bottle of wine.  And, we ordered a bottle of wine (they only have Italian wines) and the sommilier came over to ask us about our preferences after we ordered.  Unfortunately, what we picked out was not what we would typically order but he kindly suggested a wine in the same price range that suited our tastes...he did not try and upsell.  However, he probably should have been there from the beginning so we would have our wine prior to any of our food.  That is my only complaint.  On to the food, we received mini chickpea bruchettas on the house and we ordered the grilled octopus to share and it was fantastic.  It was surprisingly tender and the lemon flavor balanced the dish perfectly.  For pastas, we shared the mint love letters with spicy lamb sausage and the beef cheek raviolis.  Honestly, I cannot tell you which one I loved more.  The beef cheek was extremely rich and I was glad to be sharing because I could not have had the entire plate without feeling overwhelmed.  The mint love letters were incredibly unique with a nice mint flavor and a spiciness that merged perfectly.    For entrees, I ordered the sweetbreads and my husband had the pork chop.  My sweetbreads were rich (kind of a theme) and delicious and the pork chop was good, but nothing to get too excited about.  We sort of wished we would have just split one more pasta instead of ordering entrees because they were so incredible.  We declined dessert but had the nice tray of petit fours offered at the end of the meal.  Oh, and the wine was fabulous.  We asked them to write the name down for us, but instead they took off the label and put a laminate sheet over it for us to take home.  We thought that was a nice touch.  We did not even notice the music, so maybe they have that taken care of or maybe it just doesn't bother us.  The servers were very friendly and the manager was helpful when applying our comps to the tab.  We appreciated new silver for every dish and the wooden box they brought it in and the silver tray they used when taking away our glasses.  Our water was always full and we never felt rushed.  All in all, we had a great dining experience and I would not hesitate to return.

I definitely had no preconceived ideas about the Playboy Club, but was uncertain whether or not it would be "my thing".  However, I loved every minute of my time in the Playboy Club.  If you can get over the fact that these bunnies knock women's rights back about 30 years, you can have the best time here.  We gambled with the bunnies dealing and did very well.  We were able to walk away with some extra dough laughing about how the bunnies were still learning to count cards even though people were playing thousands of dollars.  It was somewhat unbelievable.  The Playboy Club is really more of a lounge a floor below Moon...an actual club.  I tend to be more of a lounge person, so our time here was great.  We also saw some celebs which adds to the Vegas feel.  This would be a great place to get bottle service with your buddies.

We went up to Mix about 9:45 one Friday night for a drink.  We did not eat here but after my one visit up to Mix, I am dying to go back and dine.  The view was fantastic and worth the 11 dollar Grey Goose and Soda.  They even let us sit at a table without trying to pretend like it was "Reserved" for bottle service like most other lounges.  We really went for the view and it is worth 45 minutes of your time.  It is best to go before 10pm to avoid the cover charge.  Also, they had a line waiting to get in when we left...even though it was not crowded inside.  It is that "our bar is so cool, it has a line" line.    Anyway, THEHotel looked pretty cool, but I will never go back to gamble at Mandaley Bay.  The dealers are asses.

A chain that I must admit is pretty dog gone good.  I like the BBQ turkey burger with the salt and pepper matchstick fries (nothing better than crispy thin fries that are super crunchy!).  The dessert is also ridiculously good and even better when you get a free slice of cake at your b-day lunch!  Due to all the fattening things on the menu that I love so dearly, Claim Jumper gets four stars.

LOVE is all you need.  Seriously.  This was my first Cirque show and I enjoyed every moment.  The music was fantastic and I particularly loved hearing clips from The Beatles messing around in the studio when they were young.  The dancing and acrobatics were entertaining, although one of the stunts made me uncomfortably nervous.  I have heard from most that there are fewer acrobatics that the other Cirque shows, but don't let that keep you away.  If you are at all a Beatles fan, this show is fun and entertaining.  There are moments where the dancing is a little boring, but all in all, two thumbs up.  The skaters, the music, the costumes and the cirque people were all fantastic.  I would see it again!

I have had a lot of four star experiences lately, but I think this one has great potential to move up to five stars.  We dropped by North for lunch while cruising around the Kierland area this weekend.  It is breath of fresh air amidst all of the chains...I mean, I know Fox Restaurant Concepts has local chains, but it is not the typical fare found on every corner of the Phoenix metro area.    I believe the tag line at North is "Modern Italian Cuisine".  From what I can tell, that fits quite well.  While I went the salad route, with a spinach and goat cheese salad, adding pulled chicken, the rest of the menu had more of an Italian feel.  My salad had a great flavor and was huge.  My husband got the "Not Your Typical" Chicken Lasagna.  It was fantastic.  He was definitely the big winner.  Somehow North manages to make a cheeseless lasagna fantastic.  We also shared a side of asparagus and it was cooked nicely.    I would definitely go back to North and look forward to trying dinner and more of the Italian dishes on the menu.

When my beloved Texas Longhorns were playing the Mobilehoma Sooners a few years back, the press had decided that OU would beat my team.  As victory was apparent for the Longhorns in the 4th quarter, those of us in the burnt orange and white were able to cheer "OVERRATED.....OVERRATED".  That is pretty much what I want to do every time I walk into the Hard Rock.    I enjoy partying in Vegas just as much as the next person, but everytime I go to the Hard Rock, it gets a little more thuggish and a little less tolerable.  Last time I played craps, I was the only one playing while everyone else was playing the Field.  Ugh, nothing worse than Field betters.  Anyway, for my trendy, fun, young hotel experience, I would pick the Palms anyday.  We are officially finished with the Hard Rock.

After using Hertz a couple times, I knew that I had to change rental car companies.  I hit the motherload.  I have heard the rumors about Enterprise...they hire a lot of college grads, they wear suits, they are friendly...yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, the truth be told, this is the best rental car company and rental car experience I have had.  They were very quick to get through the line, upgraded me for cheap, did not try and upsell me on insurance and gas, and sent me on my way.  When I reached downstairs, a little guy in a suit grabbed me a bottle of water and took me to my car.  We did the walk around and he gave me a map and directions to the 202.  All in all, it was quick, efficient and very friendly.  I will never use Hertz again at Phoenix Sky Harbor.  Enterprise it is!
