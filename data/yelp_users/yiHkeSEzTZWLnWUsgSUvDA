You can't go wrong with Rosita's. While it isn't life-changing, I really haven't found better Mexican food in another restaurant around town. When I lived in Vegas, I would crave food from this place and couldn't find anything that was even a close comparison.   It is definitely unassuming, located in a little strip mall at Dobson and Guadalupe. There's predominantly banquette-seating with just a few tables that are half banquette, half chairs. There is a bar and a dining room - they often offer the option of seating in either area and I recommend the dining room over the bar. It is brighter, more comfortable, and I feel that the service is more attentive.   They serve delicious salsa and chips to start, and also have a hot sauce that has a good kick. If you're interested in an appetizer, our standby is the Cheese Crispi - either plain or with Green Chiles. Adding some of the aforementioned hot sauce is a good plan for nice flavors :)   My "go to" is their Green Machaca Beef Burro, deep fried, with Cheese inside. I have had Machaca at a few other restaurants and theirs is definitely at the top - it is a stewed shredded beef and is nice and moist with LOTS of flavor. I order it as the Burro deep fried, which is basically a chimichanga but without the sour cream and guacamole.   Another fun item is the Rosita Chiquita Sampler - you choose 4 mini items from a list - I usually get a Chicken Taco, Beef Flauta, Green Chile Beef (served in a little tortilla bowl), and a Green Corn Tamale. This comes with rice and beans and is nice when you aren't sure exactly what you want and you can instead try a little of everything.   I don't order dessert here very often, but have had their sopapillas (fried dough with honey, cinnamon, and sugar) which are a bit iffy (sometimes good, sometimes not)   The service at Rositas is typically pretty good, although not always the most upbeat. They tend to be quick and efficient. They serve their sodas in HUGE glasses so that you don't have to wait for refills (because you typically don't need one)   The pricing is a bit high for what you get, in my opinion - their prices have gone up $3-$4 an entree over the past 7 or 8 years, and the quality has stayed exactly the same.   That said, it is delicious and a great standby - check it out!

Completely in love with this place!   Great location in downtown Gilbert - the parking that is very close to the restaurant is a bit limited but there is a large lot about a block away.   The restaurant feels vintagey and was a foodmarket years ago, so it is maintaining that feel but providing a modern/industrial look. I don't love the tables and chairs, definitely not the most plush but serviceable.  There is a counter - complete with a bakery case - where you place your order, When it is busy you have to wait in line and are assigned a table - during slower times you just sit wherever you'd like.   The staff are all really nice and helpful.  The food is delicious. It is a bit expensive for a fairly casual place, but the quality makes it worthwhile. My favorite meal is breakfast - the demi breakfast, pancakes, and bakery items are all amazing, especially the blueberry scone! I always think of scones as being dry and not very flavorful, but theirs are exactly the opposite: moist and tasy, served with a ramekin of whipped sweetened cream. My husband and I always split one with our breakfast.   Dinner is great, too - my "go to" is the Flatiron Steak with Mr. Pibb Marinade and Fresh Veggies, super good and a perfect portion ($19) Don't leave without dessert! The Red Velvet Cake or Ice Cream Sandwich are perfect to share (the ice cream sandwich is made with two big chocolate chip cookies and vanilla icecream, cut into quarters) If you're too full, get a Salt River Bar to go (Salty and Sweet gets me every time)   They have some cool local beers. mimosas for brunch, and good coffee - their Peppermint Mocha (which is a seasonal Christmas drink) is my favorite.  Weird note: Don't miss the bathrooms - each bathroom has a different theme with decorations and a specialized soundtrack (farm, recipes, Tuscany). Very fun.

This place is the best.   The restaurant is clean and comfortable. The atmosphere is pretty active, but they have booths lining the walls that give you a bit more shelter and privacy. During the winter, request a table away from the doorway as they are really busy and the door opening and closing creates a draft that isn't very pleasant.   Anyway - we've gone to various Original Pancake houses for the last 8 years, and this one is our favorite. Their staff are consistently good at what they do, providing personal service and staying attentive, even when it is obvious that they are slammed. Some of our favorite servers are Yvette (who remembered our orders even if it was a month or two since our last visit!) and Dino, who was always helpful and great.   The atmosphere and service provide the perfect foundation for the best basic, homemade breakfast food in the universe. Their menu is huge - loads of different pancake options, omelets, benedicts, waffles, french toast, and CREPES, plus some lunch stuff. I. LOVE. THEIR. CREPES. Seriously the only breakfast place I've been to that makes them so perfectly. Their strawberry crepes are good, but pretty sweet. I usually get the "Shells" which are their plain crepes with a little powdered sugar and then I get a side of strawberry syrup (which is not syrupy stickiness - it is a housemade fresh strawberry puree) SUPER GOOD.   Other favorites are the 49er flapjacks, challah french toast, Strawberry Pancakes, Corned Beef Hash (served with poached eggs and dee-licious potato pancakes) even their basic scrambled eggs are incredibly tasty, as are their meats: sausage patties are flavorful and perfectly crispy, the bacon is thick cut and addictive.  I don't love their orange juice (too pulpy for me), their coffee is good and their hot cocoa is just the ticket on a cold day - they use milk instead of water and top it with thick, real whipped cream that is not out of a can ... can't get better than that!   The prices are higher than a fast food place but cheaper than the strip.   I've been to lots of Original Pancake locations- 4 or 5 in California, 2 in Wisconsin, 1 in Florida, 1 in Arizona, and all of the Las Vegas locations are THE. BEST. The Freudenberger group runs the Las Vegas franchises and they do a top notch job without all of the weird idiosyncrasies that many of the other locations seem to have.  I'm so sad that I'm 6 hours away from my favorite breakfast spot. I would eat at the Original Pancake every day if I could.  Go, and have some crepes for me :)

This place just was not very good.  My in-laws suggested it as they'd been there before, we were in the area and needed to get dinner.   It was initially quite promising, as it is in a cute little building that is decorated in a quaint Italian style. The restaurant itself is HUGE, with a series of different rooms all stuffed to the gills with tables. There was a long wait (over 20 minutes), which was weird for a random Wednesday evening in the middle of Mesa, but I was hopeful that it meant the food was great!  The night was beautiful, so we sat out on the patio to enjoy the great weather. The bread served to start was negligible. The server seemed VERY new to serving and it showed. She seemed shy and had trouble talking to the table. I asked a question about the greens in one of the salads and she initially gave me the incorrect answer so I decided to have another item (she came back later to correct it, but we had already ordered so I just stuck with what I had decided on)   Their menu is really basic - pizzas, pasta... that's pretty much it. There are very few/almost no options that are protein centric - anything with a protein has pasta, sauce, etc. so if you are trying to eat healthy and don't want one of their (underwhelming) salads, you're really left without options. We ordered pastas and they were okay but not great - there wasn't a lot of flavor to what we got - Chicken Marsala, Penne Caprese.   The prices seemed pretty high for the quality/flavor of the food.   Oh, and at the end of the meal someone hanging out nearby on the patio lit up a cigarette, which I personally hate and also thought was pretty inconsiderate since our 1.5 year old son was with us.   All in all, I don't really want to ever return.

I've attended the AZ Renaissance Festival for over 15 years now and love it!  From the moment that you approach the front gates and are greeted/heckled by the crowd of townspeople, you're transported back to a fantasy version of the middle ages. Whether you choose to dress up in period-appropriate attire or show up in your 21st century duds, you'll feel right at home amidst the quaint shops, cottages, and stands that make up the milieu of the Arizona Renaissance Festival.   When we start early (a good idea if you'd like to avoid the hottest part of the day and the longest lines/biggest crowds) my favoritest way to begin the day is with pastries or the freshly made crepes. There are several very munchable snacks that are perfect for enjoying as you stroll: cinnamon roasted almonds, freshly made pretzels (sold from a large rack carried over a gentleman's shoulder as he wanders the crowd), heck, even the famous (and delicious!) Turkey Leg is very portable. The Turkey Leg, complete with crispy skin, is delicious but the portion is HUGE, I can rarely come even close to finishing. Additional substantial meal-fare items are the bread bowls (my husband's favorite) and Steak on a Stake - all yummy!   If you've ever wanted to try your hand at throwing knives, axes, or tomatoes, this is the place for you! There are lots of different games (which have an additional cost) and rides to pass the time and keep the kiddos busy - a huge swan-swing, pirate ships, spinning butterfly swings are all fanciful options to choose from.  We always try to make the most out of the free entertainment offered and start our day by plotting out the shows that we'd like to see - our favorites are Barely Balanced (acrobats that are talented and are also hilarious), Thom Sellectomy the Sword Swallower (gross but impressive), Falconry, where they show off lots of beautiful rescued birds over an open green belt (it is educational and interesting!) and of course Jousting. The Jousting is a little cheesy, but we typically try to catch the last show: The Joust to the Death, which is the best one.  It is easy to fill the gaps between the shows, games, and meals by wandering through the shops and browsing their wares; they have lots of unique items from renaissanc-y clothing to weapons and jewelry to wooden toys to furniture.   The petting zoo - complete with ducks, bunnies, sheep dogs, pigs, goats, and a highland cow(!) - as well as the Greyhound Rescue pavilion with their sweet pups are always obligatory stops to get in our warm fuzzies :)  Tips: Be sure to bring cash, as many of the food vendors don't accept credit cards. Also, if you plan on attending the shows, set aside cash to give after the performance - they are free, but the performers live off of the tips and they do a great job, so it is good to have cash handy if you feel so inclined. There are ATMs in the faire, but the fees that they charge get expensive.  Traffic on the 60 headed out to the festival gets really, really bad. Mid-day on a busy weekend can turn what might normally be a 40 minute drive into 1.5-2 hours, so be prepared.   Parking is well done - they've taken a page from the Disney parks and have a bunch of people there to direct all of the cars into specific spaces in a very quick and efficient manner.   The parking lot and grounds are all in a dusty dirt field, so plan accordingly with what you wear. If it is rainy, that all turns to mud and it is a MESS!   Bathrooms throughout the whole festival are clean and modern... there is a restroom outside the entry that typically has long lines, but the lines for the restrooms inside tend to be much shorter.   If you're looking for something unique and fun that will transport you to another time and place, definitely make the trek to the Arizona Renaissance Festival; its a blast!

We just had a generally bad experience with this place.   Our car was hit by another driver and had to go into the body shop for a few weeks of work. Our insurance company covered a certain amount per day for a rental car and they directed us to this location to pick up a car.   We had $30 per day to spend and supposedly were using this rental car company because the insurance company had a partnership with them for good rates.   I've rented quite a few cars and am usually able to get a decent car for $20-30 per day from non-airport locations, so my expectation was that we would be able to get a reasonable rental car for this rate.   Unfortunately, we were given just one option; a Dodge Avenger. This car was terrible. The interior of the car had not been properly cleaned and there was some sort of sticky liquid in/around the cup holders, which was gross. The rest of the car just did not seem clean overall, for example, my husband had to point out a large stain on the back seat when we picked the car up initially, and the guy helping us did not apologize nor was he particularly concerned about it - apparently stained upholstery is okay by their ... standards... ? But to me it is just ... ewww.   We had the car for 3 weeks, which means that they were making about $650 over the course of our rental, but apparently $650 did not entitle us to a clean car.  In addition to the cleanliness issues mentioned, the car was also in bad repair. When we left the rental location, we soon noticed that the brakes squeaked constantly. I can't believe they are renting out cars that are not functioning correctly - this is crazy! It doesn't seem safe at all.   Our car in the shop is an SUV, which we usually use for toting the whole family, carseat, groceries, percussion equipment, etc around town on the weekends and in the evenings. As a result, the tiny Avenger was a complete disappointment and not terribly useful to us, however the cost to rent an SUV (hundreds of dollars per day) was silly and not a possibility. My only consolation was that it was a small car, so it would of course be more gas-efficient than our lumbering, gas guzzler SUV, right? Ummmm NOPE! We had to fill this car up about once per day on the weekends. I honestly don't know how this level of inefficiency is legal, considering how horribly wasteful it is (not to mention how expensive this got)   At the end of our rental we discovered that their hours are completely inconvenient to anyone who works a normal job, and they do not have an overnight key drop for when they are not open. We got the call from our mechanic at 5:00pm on Thursday that our car was ready and could be picked up. This meant that we needed to drop off the rental car right away as our insurance would not continue covering the rental now that the work on our other vehicle was finished. This location closed at 6:00pm, which meant that we would not make it there before they closed. We definitely did not want to have to personally pay for this car for even one day considering how unhappy we were with it already.  We called around to see if we could drop it off at an alternate location that was open later, in order to avoid any charges, but were told that while we could do this, it would be subject to a $50.00 fee for drop off at a different location. This is a ridiculous fee considering it is almost 2 days' rental cost. No one with Enterprise was willing to help, even after explaining the situation.   Ultimately, we had to get to work 2 hours late so that we could wait till 8am to drop off the rental car before driving to the other side of town where we work. It was just such a stupid process.   We did mention the drop off situation to the agent we were dropping the car off with when we returned it and they tried to argue that we could drop off at an alternate location and she was apparently unaware of the $50.00 fee that their company charges to do this. She also tried to defend the lack of an overnight drop off as a safety issue, which I understand considering that this location is not in a great part of town (but this is still not a reasonable excuse for being so inconvenient, honestly)   The parking lot is extremely narrow and weird, so getting in and out is a pain.   Don't use this location (or really Enterprise in general) at all if you can avoid it, they seem to be awful and have terrible, dirty cars that aren't kept in good repair.

Elmer's is a randomly delicious hole-in-the-wall Mexican food spot that has been in downtown Chandler for roughly one million years.   My family started going to Elmer's when we moved to Chandler from Milwaukee, Wisconsin about 20 years ago. I can safely say that it was my first experience of more "authentic" Mexican food, as the stuff we had in the Midwest seemed to have been made by people who had ONLY seen pictures of Mexican food, but had not actually tasted the real thing. (the Mexican restaurant of choice in WI during my childhood was called, unironically and naively, Chi-Chis... no joke)   That said, I have great memories of this place! It is tiny, tucked into a small strip immediately opposite Chandler high school. There is a parking lot in the back that can be difficult to navigate when it is crowded. There is a decent patio, however I never end up sitting out there as the tables and benches are made of concrete, which feels like lava during the hotter 7 months of the year. The interior is not particularly special, but also has not changed a bit since I first visited; the furniture looks like it may have been inherited from a McDonalds or other fast food restaurant from the 80s, the floors are linoleum (I think? Maybe tile), and there are fairly cheesy murals of cartoony animals throughout. There is a wrought iron waist-high fence that indicates where to form a line, and a counter where the orders are taken. The menu is done in old-school marquis style, with plastic letters attached to the backing. If you're looking for something in particular, be sure to look at ALL of the menu boards - they have a large menu that stretches all the way behind the long counter, above the kitchen, it is not very well lit, and it is easy to miss something if you only pay attention to the boards that are immediately in front of you and easy to see.   I have a few "go to" items - the Strips are oddly yummy... tortilla strips (in lieu of chips) topped with unmelted shredded cheese. Weird, right? They're crazy salty and for some reason, in the hot Chandler weather, the cool cheese with the crunchy chips usually hits the spot. Adding a dab of their hot sauce here and there (also very salty) adds a little heat and flavor when needed. The Cheesy Beef Tortilla is basically the one thing that I order here - not because other stuff isn't good, but because the Cheesy Beef Tortilla is just THAT good. It is a large tortilla (probably about 12" in diameter) filled with Green Machaca Shredded Beef, lots of cheese, tomatoes, and onions, then broiled. It is folded first in half, then in quarters and is usually a "knife and fork" sort of thing. In theory it is like a quesadilla, but in practice it is softer, fuller of delicious stuff, and just tastier overall. They do a good job with their Machaca - very flavorful, good meat (not too fatty, which is a problem I often find with shredded beef in Mexican food)   I've also tried tacos, fry bread, burritos, etc - all good, at least standard if not better than most.   Pricing is reasonable in my book. On a recent visit we got a Cheesy Beef Tortilla, Two Tacos, Two Drinks, and an order of Strips for around $12.   The line/order/wait scenario is a bit of a pain sometimes - I visited on a weekend midafternoon and there were one or two people in front of me in line, which was not bad. However, once you order, you have to wait to hear your number called and pick up your food from the end of the counter. I think we probably waited upwards of 15 minutes for our food to be ready, and it was difficult to entertain the baby while also listening attentively for my number. I think they could definitely improve by creating a table-number setup for dine-in orders so that guests could take a seat, snack on their strips, etc while waiting for their food.   The staff are pretty nice - not overwhelmingly friendly but they made things easy and had kind demeanors.

I really can't recommend The Breakfast Club.   It's been on my mental "to try" list for awhile and I was excited to check it out for brunch with a girlfriend. I've heard it is a busy place on weekends, so I took advantage of a rare weekday off to go and try it without having to fight weekend crowds.   Upon entering, I was impressed with the decor: a cute, bright bar borders the front area and there is a smattering of high cocktail tables with barstools in the "Bar/lounge" area. The buttery yellow freestanding curved booths through the center of the room are tres-cute and the cheery color scheme is complemented by the exposed brick walls - all adorable! There are windows lining one side of the dining room and an outdoor patio with umbrellas that would likely be lovely in nicer weather (but not in July)   I showed up on time, but my friend had texted me to let me know she was running a little late.   There was no one, I repeat NO ONE waiting when I entered the restaurant, and several free tables of varying sizes were available in the dining room. The bar area was pretty empty (I think there were a few people sitting up at the counter)   I approached the hostess stand, where THREE hostesses were standing around, not helping anyone. I let them know that I needed a table for two, and was asked where the other person was. I explained that she was running a few minutes late and the girl haughtily advised me that "we don't seat incomplete parties - you can wait over there until she gets here". Over there was the bar area. I awkwardly clambered up onto one of the barstools and sat alone while alternating between staring at my phone and eying the several still empty tables in the dining room. After about 5 minutes of this, I was fed up. I get it, the Breakfast Club is a busy breakfast spot on the weekends. I bet that the "we don't seat incomplete parties" rule is something to live by on Saturdays and Sundays. I'm sure that they're overrun with pushy, obnoxious people demanding tables and annoying guests who camp out at tables for hours on end while waiting for their elusive additional guests who never show up. But this was a Friday, there were empty tables, and I wanted to sit down and order a drink instead of being punished by being forced to sit in their lobby since my friend hadn't gotten there yet. So, I tried again in hopes that they'd relent in light of their non busyness. But alas, the young, rude hostesses unhelpfully stuck to their guns and directed me back to the bar area.   When my friend arrived, we were promptly seated in a booth at the back of the restaurant. We waited a considerable amount of time for a server to finally come to the table (my 10 minutes of waiting in the lobby would've been more productively spent sitting at my booth waiting for the server to finally show up - the timing would've been perfect!)   I asked for a Diet Coke and was smugly advised that "we don't carry any diet sodas... we have bottled natural sodas" This was weird, but this is Scottsdale so I guess I should expect pretension (?) I switched my order to Orange Juice - flustered by the server's curt demand for the size I'd like, I mistakenly answered "large"... we'll revisit this in a moment.   For my entree, I tried their BCs B&G - it seemed like one of the few interesting items on the menu, with Jalapeno Biscuits topped with fontina, sausage gravy, and eggs.. I was looking for some flavor and the jalapeno biscuits sounded like just the ticket. Unfortunately, I was wrong. There was a little hot sauce drizzled on top of the gravy, but even that was overwhelmed by the creamy blandness of the gravy, leaving the dish heavy and lacking in any sort of complexity. My friend ordered an omelet and  she remarked that it was very greasy.   When our server dropped off the check, I learned that my large orange juice was $7.00 (!!) I took another sip of my average glass of orange juice, just to ascertain if perhaps I had groggily ordered a mimosa or screwdriver in lieu of my standard OJ... NOPE! Regular orange juice = $7.00, guys. FYI.   I can't pinpoint what I disliked most about sitting by my lonesome little self in the bar...perhaps it was that it was morning and while I'm not a big bar person generally, I'm particularly less bar-ish before noon. Perhaps it was being isolated as though I was being made an example of. Maybe it was my time spent puzzling over the decision to alienate a customer after they've barely crossed the threshold of the restaurant. Or maybe it was that I was being treated like I was trying to get into an exclusive nightclub when really it was just a mediocre, overpriced breakfast restaurant. Regardless, it absolutely ruined my visit. I could continue regaling you with my thoughts on this awful experience, but I've got to get back to my busy schedule of studiously avoiding The Breakfast Club for any and all meals for the rest of my life.  Ciao!

I love the Original Pancake House. This one is super weird, but less weird than it was once upon a time.   My first visit was probably 5-7 years ago. They had a multitude of signs plastered on the door and in the entry "NO CELL PHONES" "CASH ONLY" "WE DON'T LIKE YOU" (I made that last one up, the first two are for reals) They didn't have half of the things I was used to ordering at Original Pancake Houses elsewhere and they had *gasp* bad bacon (cardinal sin for any breakfast place) Additionally, the beverage situation was bizarre... like, I ordered a Diet Coke, hubs ordered a regular Coke, and they came in aluminum cans - one Diet Coke, one regular ... Pepsi? Service was gruff. The orangey/bluey/turqoisey tackiness of the decor made my eyes hurt.   Fast forward to my experience 2 weekends ago... still lots of signs on the door, but I had called ahead to verify and although there is a sign that it is cash only and an ATM just inside, they actually DO take credit cards now, thank goodness. I think there may have been a no cell phones sign, but it doesn't seem as strictly policed (I was able to check in on Yelp and take my obligatory food photos) They even sat our incomplete party --- craziness! It was great. The birthday girl was running a little behind, so we were able to grab a table so that we were ready for her. We were visiting on a Saturday, so I expected a wait and bustling busyness, but while there were other patrons around, it was not jam packed and there was no wait for a table or service. Our server was pretty nice - not bubbly but not grumpy.   The menu seems to have improved - they had plenty of strawberry treats (my go-to choices) and I ordered plain crepes with delicious strawberry syrup. On my last visit, the only syrup option for my crepes was "tropical", so I was very pleased with the current situation. Delicious bacon, plus some yummy pancakes, Strawberry Crepes, and Eggs Michael rounded out our orders. Great reviews all around. The beverage service has progressed to normal fountain drinks, which was much nicer than my past experience.  The oddly shaped table was a bit strange (we were on a banquette in a corner and 2 out of the 5 people in our group sat a little awkwardly on corners of the table) and the super tacky decor still hurt my eyes, but overall the place is clean, bright, and generally welcoming.   I will definitely visit again (sooner than 5-7 years from now, I hope) and look forward to more of the breakfast-y wonderfulness I've come to expect from my favorite Original Pancake House locations.

Love, love, loved Roaring Fork!   The dining room is warm and cozy, with lots of wood and stone in the decor. Usually a Southwestern theme like theirs can come across as pretty casual, but they manage to make it feel like a classic, upscale lodge and touches like lovely crystal and white table cloths lend to the appropriate high end atmosphere.  Based on other great reviews, we started with the Kettle of Green Chile Pork, which was as amazing as expected. The amount of pork served was more than the initial serving of tortillas could accommodate, so we needed to request seconds so that we could scrape the bottom of the kettle and finish every last delicious tidbit.  Our entrees were the Boneless Buttermilk Fried Chicken (mine), Sugar Cured Duck Breast (hubby) and Rainbow Trout (friend) All were delicious - I particularly loved the peppercorn gravy with my Fried Chicken, which was full of flavor. The Duck that my husband had was melt-in-your mouth tender and flavorful, and the skin on my friend's Trout was too good to leave on the plate (she normally bypasses it but instead it was her favorite part!)   We did order a side of the Green Chili Mac n Cheese which was good, but not life changing.  My memory is a bit fuzzy after all of that amazing food, but I believe we had a huckleberry bread pudding for dessert, which was a great way to end a super yummy meal.   Service was good - not overwhelmingly personal, but attentive and nice.  My hubby works just around the corner, so we nee to head back again very soon :)

My Father in Law always says that going to TC Eggington's is like being on vacation, and he is so right!  It is a bright, sunny restaurant with a little bit of outdoor seating, however I always prefer to sit inside for either the airconditioning or heat, depending on the time of year. The decor in the restaurant is preppy-country, with chicken wire accents (ie. in the menu covers), Country-style tables and chairs, llight colors, lots of windows, and flowers on each table.   The servers are typically very good - they tend to be young, clean cut, and well spoken. They all dress in pastel polo shirts, khaki shorts, and loafers, which lends to the resort/Country Club feel of the place. There is an older gentleman who is usually at the front desk; I believe he is the manager or owner. He is often friendly but has also been a bit rude on occasion - try to let this slide if you can as the rest of the restaurant is so worth it!   The food is great - I really haven't anything that I did not like, although there are definitely some favorites! My favorite dish at TC's is the Au Pear Grenache Omelet - a delicious omelet filled and topped with bacon, almonds, fresh slices of pear, and gruyere cheese. It is a nice savory omelet with a hint of sweetness from the pears. The crunch of the almonds keeps it interesting and it is SO GOOD. It is served with breakfast potatoes (a nice complement to the texture of the omelet) and a house-made English muffin. The English Muffin is a great way to finish - they have yummy apple-cinnamon preserves on every table.   My husband's favorite dish is a lunch item: the Natie Bomb Sandwich. It is a turkey sandwich served on 12 grain bread with bacon, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and APPLE (yum!) with a sundried tomato sauce. It usually comes with a cold pasta salad, but I recommend going with an alternate side as the pasta salad isn't all that great.   The pancakes, fritatta, etc are all delicious as well! I highly recommend TC Eggingtons for a nice, vacationy breakfast.  OH! And the best thing: They take reservations. They are usually super busy for brunch on the weekends and you can wait 30 minutes + for a table, but if you know you want to dine with them ahead of time, make a reservation and everything is so much easier. I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes whenever I make a reservation ahead of time.

I love independent/art/documentary/not-mainstream movies, so consequently, Camelview is one of my favorite spots as they are one of the few theaters here in the valley that gets these films.  Positive things about the theater:  *Great movies!  *Friendly employees *Reasonably sized drinks (movie theater "bucket-o-cola" drinks are a pet peeve of mine and their small is equivalent to a medium soda from a fast food restaurant, which is just perfect)  *Yummy cinnamon almonds for sale at the concession stand *A retro-y feel   Negatives *Older theater that feels a bit rundown *No stadium seating *Seats that are not particularly comfortable  Point of note (not positive or negative) *because of the type of movies they show, it seems like it is often popular with an older crowd of moviegoers. This can make for a sortof unique moviegoing experience if you come from a different demographic.  It is a fun spot that we manage to visit every couple of months. I wish that there were more options for Art films here in the Valley, but for the moment I do love Camelview, because I don't really have a choice in the matter ;)

Joe's Real BBQ is one of my favorite places. Comfort food in a comfort environment served by friendly people - just the best.  Located in downtown Gilbert, the historic brick building is solid and homey. We try to visit at non-peak hours or on weeknights, but if you show up at dinner time on a Friday or Saturday, you'll be greeted with a long line of patrons waiting for their opportunity to step up to the counter to order some tasty fixins :) Despite appearances, the long line does not usually entail a long wait - their counter service team has the process down to a science and they move people through relatively quickly.   The line moves through the dining room with booth style tables to one side and large wooden tables to the other side through the center. Once you reach the front of the line, you make your way past a selection of bottled drinks and up to a soda fountain complete with fresh brewed root beer and home made lemonade (my pick) Grab a tray, napkins, and utensils, then slide on up to the counter. You place your order and move forward while they prepare it. By the time you reach the selection of desserts, your meat and side are landing on the glass top in front of you. I usually go for the BBQ sandwich meal, as it is just enough - 1/4 lb of meat on a bun + 1 side dish. My typical meat of choice is the Chopped Pork, although when I'm trying to be "healthy" (ha!) I also enjoy the extremely moist chicken and turkey offerings as well. As far as side dishes, there's just one choice for me: Cheesy Potatoes. Usually served lukewarm, they're cheesy with just a hint of spice and they're delicious.   Now, the desserts ... I really can't walk away without getting one of their freshly baked chocolate chip cookies: the chips are usually still melty and warm. However, their Rootbeer cake is incredibly moist with a unique, yummy flavor and just a hint of frosting, and my husband loves their lemon cake. They also have a to-die-for corn bread served with honey butter, but I often skip it as I'm so carbed up from everything else I've already ordered (darn)   Don't forget the barbecue sauce! I am actually aghast to say that the first time I had Joe's, I didn't like it! This was because I had the original barbecue sauce, which I've discovered is just too sweet for me. Once I learned about the spicy habenero barbecue sauce, I was good to go - it is delicious and adds the perfect pop of flavor to my sandwich.   If the weather is nice, skip eating in the dining room and head out to the yard outside. There are rows of picnic tables perched beside a large, grassy lawn which is the perfect place for kids to run around and burn off steam while the adults finish up their meals and chat. The area is bordered by a white picket fence which contains the kiddos from the busy street just beyond, so that you can relax while they play. The whole area is crowned with strings of lights that lend a lovely glow as you dine. If the weather is not-so-nice, I usually try to grab a booth on the far side of the room, so I'm not eating amongst the people standing in line. There is also an enclosed patio area which works well as a hybrid of the two dining experiences - I find that it is a bit noisy usually.   The restaurant itself is quaint with an obvious Arizona Agriculture theme - my son loves checking out the giant John Deere tractor that holds court at the center of the room, and he often peers longingly into the upcycled fuel pump... now turned into a gumball machine.   If you're jonesing for Joe's but don't want to wait in line, consider calling ahead and then picking your order up at the window outside - it is a good way to get your fix :) we've also gotten take out for several get togethers that we have hosted/attended and it really takes the pressure off of having to cook because everyone likes Joe's!

An absolutely beautiful gym with pretty much everything you can ask for in one spot.   Nestled within DC Ranch, walking up to the Village is like entering a luxury resort. The professional staff greets you cheerfully as they scan you in.   You descend to the luxurious locker room areas where your membership card serves as a key for your daily locker. The locker room is stocked with everything you need to get ready for the day post-workout - showers feature shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shaving cream, and even razors. Fluffy white towels and washcloths are plentiful, and there are vanity stations complete with hairdryers, flatirons, curling irons, q-tips, cottonballs, mouthwash, and makeup mirrors.  Stop by the water station on the main level to fill your cup with ice and water to take with you while you work out.  Once you hit the gym-floor, the options are endless. Upstairs is an extensive cardio area with ellipticals, stairmasters, and treadmills. There is also jogging track, a Kinesis area and TRX area on the upper level. The main floor has a basketball court, racquetball courts, and a weight training area with a few hidden surprises like a Curve treadmill (not electronic and VERY challenging) and Jacob's Ladder.   I've attended several group classes including Pilates mat classes, Interval Training, Kinesis, and Core, all of which have been challenging and fun. The trainers are friendly and helpful, providing good instructions. The equipment is in good condition and is plentiful.   The cafe has some great healthy options for a post-work out meal, although they also offer some pretty tempting non-healthy options as well (Pizza, chili fries, cookies) which are tricky when you're trying to burn off those calories :)   Features I haven't yet used are their childcare (which I hear is wonderful), the salon and spa, and the pool.   The gym can get a bit crowded during peak hours and I've had a few workouts that were derailed from my original plan because there were group classes taking place in the area I planned to use (ie. the weight area) but the nice thing is that there are so many options that it's not too tough to readjust.   The Village is one of the few places I can say it is a pleasure to work out :)

Cosmo is a fun park for our pups.  The dog park itself consists of three areas and my two huge Golden Retrievers happily make use of both the Swim area and the larger dog run.   We've been bringing them here for several years (the dog park was often a highlight of our visits from Vegas when we still lived out of state) and while I still love the park, there was definitely a time when it was in better shape.   Currently, the larger dog run areas are not grassy at all - they are gravel/dirt and this means that when you decide to go to the dog park, you're committing to a dusty, messy experience. My pups don't mind, but my clothes and car usually do :)   That said, the dock on the lake is a source of endless amusement for my swimmers, and the sheer size of the dry area means that they can run and run to their hearts' content, burning off all of that excess energy and buying me a few hours of rest before they are bugging me for yet another walk :)   They love to socialize with the other dogs at the park and enjoy chasing balls (even the ones that aren't thrown for their benefit)   There is one small pavilion area in the main section, and sometimes it is a bit frustrating that owners let their dogs loose and then hang out in the pavilion instead of supervising their pooches. That said, I have yet to experience any truly bad doggy behavior at this park, so it is really just a matter of preference and I'm aware that not everyone's going to do what I think is best!   We appreciate having such a wonderful park nearby to enjoy.

I really enjoy Dragon Wok. It is tucked away in a little strip mall on Ray Rd in Gilbert and is very unassuming, however once inside it is clean and comfortable with nice furnishings.   The service has always been great, the female manager/owner (I'm not sure which) recognizes us when we come in, even though for awhile it was only every few months (we lived out of state) She is very nice and sweet.  I recommend Dragon Wok for lunch over dinner - they have great specials that include an entree, crab wonton, egg roll, and rice for around $7 or $8. Dinner gets a bit pricier and everything is a la carte - the dinner prices are close to PF Chang's pricing, which seem high considering it is such a small restaurant and in a strip mall.   The food is great! Very freshly prepared, great veggies, sauces that aren't thick and sticky. I typically order the General Chicken, which is spicy but not overly so. They pass the "egg roll test" that I have for Chinese Restaurants: their egg rolls are delicious! Crispy with a wrapping that isn't too thick or too thin, doesn't taste like old frying oil, and the filling is a nice blend of veggies.   I do wish that they offered desserts - I always feel like something sweet at the end of the meal and have to be satisfied with just a fortune cookie :)

Coffee Rush is a quintessential coffee shop hangout.   It has all of the elements necessary for a "go to" spot:  Good drinks: My favorites are the Black and White Frost, Mint Mocha Frost, and Deadly Soda.   Good Customer Service: The baristas are always cheerful, very quick, and sometimes a bit quirky  Nice enough indoor seating: It isn't plush, at all. But, there always seems to be enough seating, and the groupings of tables and chairs are varied enough that there is generally space to comfortably seat groups of any size (from tables of 2 for my hubby and I to a banquette table that we could squish 8 people into if needed)  Free Internet Access with the purchase of a drink: When you buy your drink, you can ask for a code to log onto the internet. It is good for 3 hours. I can't imagine complaining about 3 hours of free internet - if you've sat in the restaurant for 3 hours, its time to buy another drink anyway. Their process is painless and the connection is always decent, unlike other "free internet" places where you are subject to a limited amount of bandwidth that can be taken up by squatters who aren't buying anything and are streaming videos, music, etc for hours on end.   Loyalty Card: You know the drill - you get a card, they stamp it, you get a free drink eventually. Its nice to have and is an incentive for me to return to Coffee Rush locations instead of hitting up a competitor.  There are a few things that are just okay - namely, the pastry selection and the patio.  The pastry selection is pretty disappointing. I got a muffin once and it was just sort of crumbly and average. The things in the case don't really ever look very good and aren't your typical coffee shop fare - think storebought cheesecake and baklava instead of muffins, breakfast breads, croissants, etc.  The patio is actually quite nice - spacious, shaded, has misters, plenty of seating, lots of plug ins for laptops, etc. However, they allow smoking out there and so, being a non-smoking asthmatic, I unfortunately can't comfortably spend time out there. My wish is that they would either a) disallow smoking, which I realize isn't likely or b) have two separate patios - a smoking patio and a non-smoking patio, preferably on opposite sides of the building. For the moment, I just stay inside, which is generally just fine since its 100 degrees or more outside anyway.  I can definitely recommend Coffee Rush! Check it out :)  DISCLAIMER: I am not a coffee snob. I barely drink coffee at all, but I DO drink coffee at Coffee Rush, so take that as you will.

Another great coffee shop :)   This one is perched amidst the fields of Agritopia, and the building itself is actually an old tractor shed. Once more, a "Joe's" project that has a retro/modern industrial feel.   The dining room has a nice amount of tables and chairs and there is a sitting room at the back with some comfy couches and coffee tables - definitely a cozy spot. The large patio is lovely when the weather is right and the surrounding foliage keeps it from befalling the "parking lot effect" that so many Arizona patios face (parking lot effect definition: a great patio that is spoiled by a view of parked cars, smells of exhaust, and sounds of traffic - those things the Coffee Shop is NOT, thank goodness)   They have an awesome bakery counter (My favorite thing!) Try to get there in the morning for some DELICIOUS muffins, which are shaped like little loaves instead of like traditional muffins. I always try to find random seasonal flavors that aren't always there - the best one I've had was a strawberry lemon poppyseed muffin - to die for! Also high marks to the cinnamon roll, a peanut butter chocolate scone, and any of the cupcakes. The cookies and whoopie pies are hit and miss - they look adorable but don't quite stand up to the other offerings.   The food-food is also great - again, my preference is breakfast and we always share the Papas Breakfast Burrito (with eggs, bacon, potatoes, and salsa) as it is HUGE and definitely large enough for two, particularly if you're also getting a pastry. I've tried the Turkey Cranberry sandwich at lunchtime and it was tasty as well.   I have not actually had their coffee, but my sister and grandmother, who are both connoisseurs, swear by it so I feel comfortable recommending that as well. As for me, I'm usually ordering a big glass of fresh OJ.   I wish that they were open later (they close at 8 or 9pm most nights, 4pm on Sundays) - its the type of place I often think of for a late night snack and coffee once I've put the little one to bed and I'm always disappointed to remember they're already closed!  Lastly, as of my last visit with my son they did NOT have a changing table in the women's bathroom. Considering the large numbers of families/moms who frequent the shop, it really seems like a given and I was a bit shocked that they didn't have one - I ended up toting my son and what was left of my meal out to my SUV to change his diaper in the back, which doesn't exactly match up to the serene coffee shop experience I'm planning on when I come out to the Coffee Shop :)

We don't have fast food very often, but usually when we do we like to go to Chick Fil A.  Generally speaking, Chick Fil As are clean with polite, friendly employees and consistently good food.   This location is the exception to that rule.   The restaurant is constantly filthy in one way or another. It is still possibly a step up from some other fast food restaurants, but in the context of Chick Fil As standards, this one is completely sub par.  On one visit, I was standing in front of the counter while waiting for part of my order, and I noticed that my shoes were sticking to the floor. Initially I dismissed it and moved over, but found that I was STILL sticking to the floor. I looked down and found that there was a thick layer of sticky soda (movie theater floors x 1 million) that was now caked onto my shoes and causing me to stick to the floor even after I'd moved away from it. When I was finally able to catch an employee's attention to let them know, I was told "oh, there's a leak, we know about it" with no further action (no one came to clean it up, at least temporarily, during our entire visit to the restaurant)   On another occasion, I went to get a child's booster seat and when I looked over the few seats available, found that each and every one of them was disgustingly caked with various food splattered all over them. I selected one that had the food mostly relegated to the edges and sides of the seat, and proceeded to grab several Purell packets to wipe it down myself. Several employees glanced at me during the process but weren't too terribly concerned apparently.   On a regular basis, there are consistently a variety of smaller but still obnoxious ongoing issues, such as overfull trash cans and gross bathrooms. Additionally, a tiny thing that I've noticed (and appreciated) at other Chick Fil As is that when you get a highchair, they always always have a sticky placemat laid over the back of the highchair - this is so nice, because when your hands are full of a baby, your food, etc, it is great that they are anticipating your needs by having this readily available, and having it on the highchair means it is one less thing you have to grab. However, at this Chick Fil A, it is extremely rare for the placemat to be on the highchairs; you pretty much always have to stop and pick it up separately. Again, it is small, but it does make a difference and just shows that they don't care quite as much about their customers as all of the other locations.  The staff at this location is nice enough in the scheme of fast food places, but again, does not really live up to the standards that I've come to expect from Chick Fil A as a brand. They are your typical teenaged fast food employees; where I usually find that Chick Fil A employees are respectful, polite, conscientious, and engaging, these employees tend to be a bit more removed, more interested in joking around with other employees, and while they go through the motions of decent service, they're missing that little extra that makes such a huge difference at other locations. Additionally, I usually see quite a bit of management presence on the floor at other locations, but it seems much rarer here. I've also observed managers being pretty rude to employees once or twice - most recently a manager belligerently ordering someone in the kitchen to get "some soup that is actually hot" in a very sarcastic tone with very angry body language.  The food is generally pretty much the same as other Chick Fil As, but our order does seem to be messed up more often here than at other locations. We usually order our sandwiches without pickles, and this only actually gets done about 50% of the time. It isn't a huge deal, but does completely change the flavor of the sandwich to a more pickly flavor, which no one in our family cares for.  If we had a location even only slightly further away, we would definitely make the trek, but as we are quite far from the next closest restaurant, we end up here anytime we need something quick, and each time we regret spending our money with this particular restaurant since it is so disappointing.

Hubby and I had a belated Valentine's dinner here on Saturday night and it was the best upscale meal I've had since being back in AZ, hands down.   I'll preface by saying that I am not usually a huge fan of steakhouses - they're a bit of a hard sell for me because they're generally uncreative and they just don't try very hard. However, Bourbon Steak has been on my list for awhile because I heart Michael Mina restaurants and I was pleasantly surprised to see that he had one in Scottsdale.   The restaurant is located at the Fairmont Princess but has its own entrance just beside the hotel lobby. There is no self-parking, but you can get your valet slip validated by the hostess at the restaurant so that there is no charge for using the Fairmont's valet. You're greeted by walls of wine bottles along the hallway as you enter. The decor is sleek, modern, and sophisticated with lighting that is low enough to be romantic but bright enough that you can see your companions and the food. The dining rooms are very segmented/partitioned, which creates lots of little cubbies perfect for an intimate dinner (instead of a large sea of tables in a cavernous dining room). We sat indoors but could see out to a few small patio areas which looked lovely as well.   Although they offered a split of my favorite champagne (Billecart), I opted for a specialty cocktail instead. After reviewing the list for a few minutes, I settled on a few options and asked for our server's expert opinion, as she informed us that she had bartended in the past and was very familiar with the list. She recommended the Gypsy, which was a mix of elderflower liqueur, Mezcal, and lime served up in a martini glass and it was delicious! Crisp and refreshing.   We deliberated over the menus for a bit, then placed our orders. We were surprised by a gift from the Chef (which seems to be automatic for everyone) of three small cups of french fries fried in duck fat along with a few different sauces. They were delicious, but a bit overwhelming as an amuse to a meal which promised to be quite heavy already :)   Our appetizers were Butternut Squash soup and Crispy Pork Belly. Both were tasty, although the Butternut Squash Soup was definitely the more memorable as it had a bit of habenero in it which gave the flavor a nice kick!  We both ordered NY Strip as our entree and they appeared cooked to a perfect medium and mouthwateringly delicious - prepared with just a touch of salt and butter that complemented the flavor of the grass fed beef perfectly. The side dishes were fun: Hashbrown potatoes topped with cheese, bacon, with chive creme freche on the side AND brussels sprouts with bacon marmalade. The brussels sprouts were absolutely memorable - they did not look like much when they came out (in fact I grimaced a bit because I thought that they were overcooked) BUT they were amazingly delicious and addictive... definitely a highlight.   We waited for the dessert menu with baited breath and perused it thoroughly before making our decisions. The only hiccup in the process was a misunderstanding on my part, when my sugar-deprived "diet brain" hopefully mistook the last line on the menu with overwhelming excitement:  "ALL DESSERTS  - $9"   as some sort of amazing value-tasting of every dessert on the list. Alas, my conscious mind was able to knock some sense back into me and we settled on just two of the desserts: the Beignets and the Bourbon Bar.   Point of note: The beignets say "choice of one" dipping sauce, but our server kindly reminded us that we could have all three if we wanted (and we DID!) They come with Creme Brulee (a dessert unto itself and amazingly delicious, with a perfectly toasted brulee top), Valhrona 66% dark chocolate, and Macallan Butterscotch... dunking the fluffy pastry pillow beignets into each of these was a joy - they were great!  The Bourbon Bar is deceptively small in size, but very rich! There was a brownie bottom, peanut butter ganache layer, and chocolate mousse layer covered with glacage. We cleared out every bite.  Service throughout our dinner was incredible - attentive, appropriate, gracious, but with personality. Our server was obviously knowledgeable about the menu, but even more impressive was the knowledge and enthusiasm that the back servers and food runners displayed when dropping our food - each dish was announced and explained when placed in front of us, and the staff members happily pointed out their favorites before departing the table. Our places were marked appropriately prior to each course, silverware was cleared and provided according to what we were each having. Refills for my water and my husband's iced tea were prompt and unobtrusive. The dining room captain stopped by during the meal to ascertain that we were happy with everything, and several staff members stopped on our way out to thank us for coming in and wish us a good night.  I was impressed and truly enjoyed my experience. Can't wa

I found White Lotus though Yelp (thanks!!)   I recently moved back to the East Valley and wasn't excited about having to travel into Scottsdale to get my hair done, so I was excited to find a cute, well rated spot so close to home.   I needed to get a blowout and makeup application prior to getting some family photos taken and I was lucky enough to find their December special which offered both as a combination package.   I showed up and after a brief wait I was shown back to Danielle, who asked me some questions about the occasion and my preferences, then got to work. I am pretty clueless about makeup/beauty, so I let her do her thing and it turned out great! She definitely went heavier/brighter than I would usually choose, but I could tell that she did this deliberately because I was having photos taken. The makeup also stood up well to the warm weather outside and my punkin's antics.  Once I finished up with Danielle, Jessica took over and styled my hair. She did an initial consult with me and instead of just doing a blow out, she added some curls to my style to have a bit more impact for the photos.   I loved my first experience so much that I returned to Jessica a few weeks later for a haircut. She did a great job and was super nice once again.  The Salon is calm and spa-like, the chairs are comfortable and the employees are all quite nice. They have a good selection of products and also sell some cute craft/knick knack items that are perfect little gifts.   I'm happy to add my positive review to the huge pile of other positive Yelp reviews for White Lotus Salon :)

This place is great!   I was introduced to Body Technologies through a competition I was participating in with The Village Health Club - our pre and post body composition evaluations were done with the Bod Pod: a spaceship-like chamber that measures your weight, lean muscle mass, fat, etc.   The best part is that it takes like 5-10 minutes altogether and is so super easy.   My initial testing was done in a Bod Pod onsite at The Village and my post testing was done at the actual Body Technologies location, which was very nice, intimately sized, and seemed to have a range of good training equipment (although I wasn't there to train at all)   The people that I worked with were extremely nice and accommodating. The information that the Bod Pod provides is really helpful in creating a plan of attack for weight loss, and after all of my hard work I really looked forward to getting the various levels of information from my final Bod Pod at the end of the 8 weeks I spent in the competition.   I definitely recommend the Bod Pod at Body Technologies and would imagine that their other services are just as good.

We love V's.  My husband had been having trouble finding a good barber, and we ran across the V's location near our house in Arcadia - it looked like a pretty cool, manly spot and he liked it!   Since then, our small son has gotten big enough to need haircuts (and I am not the one to give them to him)  We tracked down the closest V's here in the East Valley and have been so pleased with this location. It is in a strip mall (like pretty much every business ever in Arizona) and has a decent number of stations set up with cushy chairs and flat panel TVs.  We brought my son for his first haircut and he was terrified of course, but they did a great job - the ladies here are very nice and seem accustomed to dealing with kids. They gave him a classic "little boy" cut and it was perfect. For his first haircut, they did provide a certificate and saved a lock of his hair for us as a keepsake.  Since then, we haven't strayed from this V's for any of his haircuts. It is a tradition for he and my husband to go down to the barbershop to get their haircuts together. They have a small "deal" that if they both get haircuts, they get $1 off each haircut. Not something that would make or break anything, but still a nice little incentive that we don't mind!   We always go on weekends and it is a bummer that they're not open on Sundays. They can often get busy, but we usually have luck and don't have a terrible wait, even on a Saturday. The TVs are a lifesaver with a little one, as it is a great way to distract him from the noise/scariness of the clippers.   My husband has been pleased with his haircuts and is usually quickly in and out.   Although V's is a chain, we've noticed some variation from location to location and this one is definitely the best of the bunch from our experience.

Sweet Republic is seriously amazing.  I have high standards for frozen dairy treats, and Sweet Republic is waaayy up there!   I was drawn to this place after learning about their unique artisan ice cream flavors: Blue Cheese Honey, Sweet Corn, Real Mint, Maple Pecan ... plus housemade marshmallows - YUM!  I was finally able to convince my hubby to make the pilgrimage because they are (incredibly) open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays, which makes it the perfect late night date spot :)   The shop is supercute, decor is contemporary and cheerful, with unique lighting fixtures. The tables are lined up along a banquette on the side of the restaurant - again, very date friendly! You can cozy up with your significant other while savoring some yummy icecreamy goodness. They have a stack of board games at the back of the restaurant, which I thought was a nice touch as well - how fun to get some delicious icecream while playing Connect Four with a friend?  The menu is excellent: from the icecreams themselves to the sundae options and awesome toppings, you really can't go wrong.  I went in expecting to order the Campfire S'More Sundae, but made a rogue move at the last moment and switched over to the Pecan Turtle Sundae in a waffle cup... omgoodness, so, so GREAT. Before settling on my sundae, I did get a quick sample of the Plum Verbena icecream and wow - light, refreshing, and unique - definitely a good pick if you're in the mood for a scoop or two.   Now, back to the Pecan Turtle Sundae: I've had lots of Turtle Sundaes and this one was just head and shoulders above anything else I've ever tasted. I seriously dreamed about it from the time I left Sweet Republic until the following weekend, when we returned so that I could have it again (and share it with my Grandmother, who is a fellow appreciator of a good frozen treat!)   The sundae is topped with hot fudge and salted caramel sauce, fresh whipped cream, and pecans that are toasted/transformed into little nuggets of greatness. The waffle bowl was the crowning glory: sweet, crispy, crunchy and delicious - be sure to get one :)   My husband ordered the Cookie Mintifesto and he loved it, although I wasn't a huge fan of the "real" mint - I prefer fake mint, I guess :) It was pretty "brisk" and not very sweet.   My son tried the Honey Blue Cheese on our second visit and was smacking his lips and "mmm-mmm"ing the whole time.   Service was alright - the sundaes take a bit of time to make and when they're busy, the employees seem stressed.   I can't recommend Sweet Republic enough as a must-try destination in itself, but it will also become an "anytime" place that you'll find yourself headed to every opportunity you have.

If you haven't been to Cornish Pasty, please set aside your computer, get into your car, and drive to one right this very moment.   It is so unlike anywhere else around, and yet exactly what I wish all restaurants would try to be.   My first Cornish Pasty visit was to the original Tempe location when it was a long narrow hallway with a bar and 2 tops crammed into it. I remember loving the food and wishing for a bit more comfort. We waited impatiently for the "new" location to open at Dobson and Guadalupe and immediately made it our regular place as it was larger and easier to get to.   Cornish Pasty Co is smart, as they not only expand to additional locations but also grow their existing locations. They've extended their Tempe location significantly since my first visit, and the Mesa location first added a beautiful patio and then a huge addition that expanded the dining room, added a bar, and made the patio even larger.   Their patio is definitely a great place to dine, with high backed booths that can easily seat 6 and even as many as 8 if you're willing to get cozy. It is a bit quieter than the indoor seating area, which makes it ideal for groups or couples that might want to have an easier time making conversation. I also love that the way it has been built creates ambiance within the patio itself and blocks the view of the parking lot. They have fans and misters, but unfortunately AZ is just too darn hot to allow you to enjoy it during the summer months.   The indoor seating is extensive and varied, and the décor is awesome! Most/all of the furniture is handmade or reclaimed/repurposed. They are the first place I saw using old doors as tabletops and church pews for benches (these tables are huge and easily seat 8 people, which is nice when you're with a big group) The color scheme is unique - dark woods with a lot of black paint, white walls, melted wax candles, and black and white photos of miners on the walls (pasties were historically used as lunches for miners in Europe) There is a "drinkin'" bar on one side of the dining room and a bar top looking into the kitchen on the other side.   On my most recent visit, they were pretty full and we were given the option of sitting up at the kitchen bar. I hadn't sat up there before and was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was! They have an elevated platform running beneath the bar which makes it easy for shorter people (like me) to clamber up unto the barstool without too much difficulty. They also had purse-hooks (all high tables should have these) in the form of carabiners that clip onto your purse strap - awesome!  I will say that sitting up by the kitchen in the middle of summer is a bit warmer than the surrounding seating... I initially worried I was going to regret our seating choice but our lovely server, Stephanie, showed up quickly to take our order and provided giant glasses of ice cold sodas and tea, then kept 'em coming. Stephanie was awesome and provided a few great suggestions (mixing two of the sauces for my husband's Meat and Cheese Pasty, for example) - she was prompt and fun. Sitting up at the counter had the added benefit of being able to watch the magic of the kitchen unfold - their chefs WORK! It was fun to see and they all seemed to be having a pretty good time with one another - I appreciated seeing how the team worked well togdether and the manager was bantery and encouraging to all of the staff.  The food... so good! Seriously have never had anything that isn't good. My go-to pasty is the Porky (although it is embarassing to order... kinda like "Moon over My Hammy" at Dennys) - it is closest to the types of pasties I grew up eating in the midwest - Pork, potatoes, onion, red wine gravy - wrapped up in a delicious crust. The portion size is perfect; if you're hungry, it'll fill you up, and if you're not so hungry, you eat one half and take the other to reheat later. Either way you win. I've also enjoyed the Italian, and my husband recently got the Meat and cheese that was amazing with a mix of Chipotle and Barbeque sauces (on our server's recommendation)   That said, one day a few years ago I went rogue and ordered soup instead of a pasty (WHAT?) Specifically, the Potato, Leek, Stilton Soup. It is incredible, you guys. Perfect, hearty, and warm during the winter but also so good that I order it even though it is 112 degrees outside. It also comes with generous pieces of homemade bread perfect for dipping or slathering with tasty butter. Now I get it every. freaking. time. and I miss out on the pasties because I just can't help it.   I've also had their Wings (delicious - sweet with a little bit of spice) and their chips (big steak-fries that do not typically come out earlier than the rest of the food)   We've had desserts before but it has been a really long time. I remember liking the fruit Pavlova as well as the Banoffee tart,

Pita Jungle is so good! I know I'm just joining the ranks upon ranks of people who also love Pita Jungle, but gosh, it is great.  I had gone to another location a year or two ago and couldn't get the delicious Chicken Lavosh Shawarma out of my head ever since! So, we finally got the chance to go back again this past weekend and it was as delicious and pleasant as I remembered.  The dining room at this location is nice: open, bright, with some homey bohemian decor. Speaking of bohemian.. that is pretty much the word of the day with this place - the staff definitely have that vibe and dress accordingly.   Our table was located right by the window to the kitchen, which was probably the least ideal part of our meal this time. It was noisy and our party of three often had trouble getting our conversation heard across the table.   The server was great - kept our drinks full and took care of our order well - everything came out right. He was friendly and helpful.   We started by sharing the hummus and pitas, which was tasty and filling - they really give you a generous portion of the hummus. After surveying the menu at length, I finally settled on a return to my original favorite: the Lavosh Shawarma Wrap and it was as delicious as I remembered! The garlic sauce inside is really what makes it, and the wrap itself is fresh, soft but a little crisp at the same time, and not greasy at all. The wrap normally comes with a Greek Salad, which I don't care for, so  opted for the grilled veggies instead (there is an upcharge for this) - they were AMAZING! I feel strange getting so excited about a side of veggies, but these were seriously delicious. Whatever sauce they cook them is is super tasty - the mix of veggies consisted of broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, mushrooms, zucchini. It was a generous portion and really good.   Pricing is pretty approachable - around $10-15 per person.

This is a pretty straightforward Pita Jungle - I've been here twice, both times for lunch on a weekday. Parking is a pain, so plan accordingly.  The decor is ... nicer?... than other Pita Jungles I've been to, as far as being less bohemian and more upscale, I suppose. If  your idea of "upscale" is minimalist modern art 80s decor (lots of black and white geometric shapes with pops of primary colors)   The food is as good as any Pita Jungle. It did take a very long time to come out, even though we ordered right away upon arrival, and while the restuarant was busy, it was not crazy busy.   The real issue is the service. We've dined at the restaurant twice, with groups that are not particularly huge - 5 people the first time, 5 people the second time.   On my first visit, the hostess tried to refuse to do anything to allow us to sit as a group of 5, unless we wanted to sit at the tall communal table. It was 6 months ago, so my memory is a tiny bit fuzzy, but what stands out is that a) our very reasonable request was apparently insane and b) she was very very rude, and continued to be rude in our direction throughout the entire meal.  On my second visit (this past week) we sat at the high communal table (to hopefully avoid conflict with any wayward staff members) The communal table is perched at the edge of the bar area, and it suffers from what I consider to be "bar-bad-service-syndrome", which is where the servers handling tables in the bar either have way too large of a section and/or are also taking tables in other parts of the restaurants, and as a result they never show up to help you.   Our server (30s, long dark hair, mean face) was incredibly annoyed with us from the very beginning. Any and every request was met with exasperated looks, irritated body language, and eye rolls galore. Not "can I please have caviar served on a gold platter while you balance on an elephant's back" sort of requests... can we please have straws, can I substitute roasted vegetables instead of salad, etc.  Here's the thing: when you disappear for 20 minutes at a time, yes, when you return to the table there are going to be several requests that have built up in the meantime, since you deserted us with no assistance for way, way too long.  We were celebrating one friend's birthday (hence the lunch outing) and when the bills were presented, I asked the server to please charge both my check and her check to my Amex. As you can imagine, irritated hair flipping and grimacing ensued.  I even made it as simple as possible by placing both checks into the same black folio. When I recieved my check back, I noticed it was for a lower than expected amount. Upon further investigation, the birthday-girl's check was charged to ANOTHER member of the party (who had not asked for this) SO. FRUSTRATING.  We worked it out amongst ourselves and beat a hasty retreat far far away. Hopefully we can find a better Pita Jungle destination somewhere close to work for future lunch-jaunts.This place is the pits.

I believe I'd been to an Arriba quite awhile ago, but it has been a long time.  We went on a busy Friday night, so in that case I try to go into restaurants prepared to make many allowances as I know that crowds of people and long waits do not make for an ideal situation.   Unfortunately, even considering my reduced expectations, I can't really recommend Arriba to anyone.   The room we were seated in had a lovely rock wall with water flowing over it, however the tables and chairs were cheap, and brightly colored which contrasted with the "zen" feeling of the water wall.   Our server was excellent - I can't remember his name. He handled the busyness of the dining room and the various requests we had to shower on him (more silverware, clean silverware, menus, etc) cheerfully and quickly. He was well spoken and just really great.  The table was filthy - the appetizer menu and condiment holders at the end of the table had old refried beans (I assume) crusted on them, the silverware on the table was dirty - even the food presentation was sloppy and gross.   Regarding the food - it is difficult to screw up the components of Mexican food - cheese, meat, beans, tortillas/chips.  The salsa seemed like jarred store salsa, so not a great start. We ordered the Nachos Grande to share and they were okay - the chips seemed like storebought tortilla chips and the toppings were scattered haphazardly across the pile.   I ordered the Hatch Chile Relleno, which I was excited about because it was noted as very spicy with three chiles beside it on the menu. It tasted okay but really did not have much flavor and was absolutely not spicy at all. The temperature of the dish was lukewarm.  We also shared the chocolate chimichanga dessert, which was pretty good (however it's tough to go wrong with chocolate!) The portion size was good for four of us to split.   The majority of my experience wasn't terrible, but the disgusting condition of the table really marred everything else, which is too bad.

Bergies is so quaint!   Located at the edge of downtown Gilbert, the white picket fence, greenery-filled garden patio, and homey cottage/shop are the perfect setting to "get away from it all"   My first exposure to Bergies was actually while dining at Joe's BBQ just next door. We were sitting outside, enjoying our meal when suddenly my 1.5 year old son was beckoned to the edge of the yard by the beautiful sounds of a live female vocalist playing acoustic guitar. We all sat listening, enchanted for quite a bit longer than we normally would have. It was then that I said "I need to check this place out!"  I finally made it over to the shop a few weeks ago and I was completely charmed. Even on a hot Arizona summer Saturday, the little garden was like an oasis. The shop itself was nice and cool, with several employees bustling behind the counter making drinks, taking orders, and calling names. They do quite a business and seemed busy, but there wasn't a line nor was there a lengthy wait. The employees I interacted with were nice without being gushingly kind.  I was pleased with my coffee - a nice kick and they had almond milk, so I was a happy camper. The furnishings are comfortable, with some counter-height tables with stools gathered near the counter, and what looked like a back room with some more comfy seating around the corner.   Their hours aren't as extended as I'd like; they close at 8:30pm on Friday/Saturday and earlier Sun - Thu. So, this won't ever be my "go-to" as it is rare that I get a few spare daytime moments to linger over a tasty caffeine laden cup of yum ... BUT if I do, I'll be headed to Bergies

Sandella's is a nice little neighborhood lunch place.   The menu is basically various iterations of many of the same ingredients in different formats (flatbread, panini, wrap) BUT they have always been unfailingly delicious.  They also seem healthier than your average quick and inexpensive food, which is a nice perk.   I pretty much always order the Buffalo chicken panini (which is wrap-esque and I often confuse the two) I love that they're completely open to modifications as I like to leave off the blue cheese dressing.   I've also sampled the Brazilian flatbread, which was tasty as well (although a bit mustard-y for me)   Service here is always very friendly - they really make you feel appreciated and are crazy accommodating.   The restaurant is very clean and comfortable.   This was one of those places that we missed terribly when we moved out of state and we get excited to visit now that we live closeby again :)

The Parlor is 100% awesome.  It is a bit hidden away but completely beautiful - comfortable but modern and funky at the same time. The entry is surrounded by greenery and white lights which sets a lovely, romantic tone. When you enter, there is a cute bar area to the right and the dining room to the left. They have a bartop at the edge of the dining room and the "Barstools" are actually like beauty parlor chairs complete with footrests - very fun! I've come in just for dessert and drinks with a girlfriend and this is the perfect place to perch :)  The pizzas are amazing - thin, bubbly crust with fresh, high quality ingredients. We usually get one or two to share alongside a few additional items from the menu. A couple favorites are the Pesto (which has pine nuts - yum!), Funghi (I'd prefer that the mushrooms were more finely chopped for texture purposes, but the flavors were super good), and the Pepperoni.   Now, regarding the other stuff: DUCK CLUB. Ohmygoodness-sodelicious. Duck + bacon + red wine tomato jam = super amazing flavors. Definitely order this.  We've also tried a few pastas, my favorite of which was the Parsnip Gnudi with brussels sprouts and other veggies - it was served as a small stew and my 1 year old son absolutely loved it.   Desserts are often interesting and they seem to change pretty regularly. We had ordered the Corn Zeppole which comes with spicy chile mascarpone and those were interesting and pretty yummy. The turtle budino was tasty, but I wished for something crunchier with it for texture.I had also had the citrus cream crepes which I didn't love as the citrus cream was a bit overpowering.   I had one of their cocktails last summer (which I can't remember the name of) and it was tasty, refreshing, and a generous size.   Service has always been pretty on point and accommodating, even when we've stopped in later at night.   The parking situation is annoying (I hate tiny parking lots that require you to valet) and I REALLY wish they'd take reservations as the wait on weekend evenings can get a bit ridiculous.

I've been receiving West Elm catalogs since well before there was an actual retail location here in AZ, and I absolutely love the style and beauty of many of their items.   That said, I was thrilled to see the Scottsdale Quarter location would be so close to my office! I've shopped at this location multiple times with average to subpar experiences each time.  The actual store is bright, modern, and lovely albeit a bit small considering that it is a furniture showroom. I enjoy their knick knack section, which seems to rotate regularly, and I also love their linens.   The true problem is the staff in this store.   I shopped at the store during Christmas - I had seen a beautiful jewelry tree that I was interested in purchasing and asked a nearby employee if there were any that were already boxed up. She uninterestedly asked me which one I was talking about (which was the one immediately in front of us) She gestured towards the back wall of the store and I noticed that there was a larger version of it on the opposite side of a display (which cost 3x as much)- perfect! I headed over to take a closer look and when I turned to ask another question of the employee, she was long gone. I finally decided to buy two gifts - one small and one large jewelry tree, and then headed to the front of the store with my purchases. I once again asked the girl at the cash-wrap whether they had a box for the gifts, as I was planning to ship them. Mind you, the entire store was littered with displays of gift boxes of all sizes as they were touting the special West Elm boxes as perfect packaging for your Christmas gifts. The employee helping me scrunched up her face and tried to say that they didn't have many left and she couldn't give me one. I pressed further and she reluctantly walked over to the nearest display to see if any of those boxes would work. After awhile, she could not find a gift box that was appropriate and I explained again that I needed to ship the gift and would REALLY like a box. At my insistence, she went and found a box in the back to pack the larger tree into so that I could ship it to my sister. This should not have been quite so difficult and I was left feeling unvalued as a customer.   This past week, I returned to West Elm in search of a picture frame. I found what I was looking for on the back wall of the store - the gallery frames, which were coincidentally on sale. I searched amongst the stacks of frames for the correct size and had no luck, so I spotted an employee a few feet away in the next section and popped over to ask for her help - I wanted to know if perhaps they had my size in the back of the store since I could not find it myself. She seemed unhappy with my question and stalked over to the shelves of frames to look for herself. She condescendingly discussed my request with someone over her headset as though it was the most difficult thing in the world and after several minutes of this I finally said that if it was too inconvenient I could just take the next size up. The woman huffed disgustedly at me, spun on her heel, and walked over to another employee to start a conversation with no further offer of help...  When I went up to the cash wrap, it was deserted. I searched around for an employee for a minute and thought I heard someone through the doorway to the stockroom. I called for them and eventually a gentleman appeared. He asked what I needed and I told him I needed to check out. While he was helping me with my purchase, he asked if anyone had assisted me. I mentioned that I didn't know her name, but referenced the rude behavior of the employee who was back by the frames and he sarcastically said "oh, the rude one, well that narrows it down for me" before continuing to check me out. No apology or further inquiry ... nothing.   Now, he was quite nice and seemed to be trying to subtly recover my business, but unfortunately didn't seem to understand a key part of customer service which is to address and apologize for any inconvenience ... and his kindness was just not enough to fix it.   I don't plan to return to this store, and although I love and recommend their products, I am hesitant to continue purchasing products from their company altogether, even through their catalog. I am completely surprised as I have never experienced anything but great service in their other brand-stores (Pottery Barn, Williams Sonoma, Restoration Hardware)

DW Bistro: *heart* (since I can't use a heart emoticon on Yelp, apparently)   Totally unassuming in a little strip mall on Fort Apache. The space is a breath of fresh air in Vegas - modern, fun, bright, pretty. Lots of white and orange (think creamsicle-chic!) with cute three dimensional star pendant lights hanging above the bar and green pops from the potted plants scattered throughout. The restaurant is fairly small, with a comfortable little patio which is a good place to enjoy the weather when it is pleasant.   Their menu is a mix of jamaican and new mexican cuisine, which seems like a strange combo but surprisingly, the flavors work together to create all sorts of yumminess in my tummy, so I'm a happy camper!  Favorite dishes - Jerk Chicken Drumette Appetizer (LOTS of flavor with some definite heat) and the Pesto Torte Appetizer, which is perfect to share - goat cheese with nuts and flatbread crackers. Entree - The Fried Chicken!! I tried a few other things prior to finding this gem on the menu - fish, short ribs, etc - and although they were good, the Fried Chicken is what keeps me coming back. The Chicken has a bit of jerk seasoning to it for some spice, the skin is crispy, the chicken is moist, and it is served with the most delicious, melt in your mouth yet unbelievably dense cornbread ever. There is also a petite pitcher of jerk gravy that you can dunk/smother/drink your meal with.   DESSERT (always the most important part) - they have a cake tasting. Yes, a cake tasting. These are not tiny bite sized pieces of cake - no - they are relatively normal sized slices of their Carrot Cake, Red Velvet Cake, and Chocolate Cake. They are all amazing. Don't get just one type of cake and say "I'll try the Red Velvet next time"... go get the cake tasting and eat it all. You can share it if you want, but I don't. It's amazing and it should be a rule that all restaurants offer cake tastings.   Lastly, service is usually quite good, particularly for an off-strip place. The greatest thing is that the restaurant owners are pretty much always around in the restaurant. They stop by the tables to say hello and chat and overall just make you feel incredibly welcome - as though you're a guest in their home.   Pricing is not inexpensive, but is definitely appropriate and even a bit of a steal considering the quality of food, service, and atmosphere.   Check it out, you won't regret it :)

Adventure dining at its best :)   I am pretty spoiled by dining in nice restaurants with beautiful ambiance, unobtrusive service that anticipates every need, and extremely high levels of comfort. Fukuburger is definitely not these things, which means it is pretty amazing to make me enjoy it so much!   That said, this is definitely the best food truck experience I've had.   They've got a simple but excellent menu that is Asian/Hawaiian influenced, with several burgers to choose from, a few sides, and awesome specials that keep each visit fresh by giving you something new to enjoy. My "go-to" is the Buta Burger, which has bacon, cheese, and a little bit of ginger on the burger. The burgers are hearty - just the perfect size for a full meal. At West-side Wednesdays, they have "Asian Chicken and Wafu" which is their version of fried chicken and waffles and is absolutely delicious - teriyaki chicken skewers and fried dough with cinnamon, sugar, and maple syrup.   They also have delicious Strawberry Lemonade that I definitely recommend, particularly during the summer months when you need something particularly refreshing.   Their system is efficient and remarkably fast considering the size of the line. They have a server at the truck taking orders as you reach the front of the line - she's always really quick but also very friendly, willing to explain the menu and make recommendations if it's your first time there. Sometimes they'll give you an idea of how long it'll take for your order to come out, sometimes not. You hang out and wait for them to call your hame for your order when it is ready at the window.   There's no place to sit... well, I take that back - they usually have some overturned Home Depot buckets and perhaps a folding table, but considering the crowd that is usually there I wouldn't count on these :) We usually tailgate in our SUV instead.   Follow Fukuburger on twitter to keep in touch with where they'll be, what the specials are (including pictures, which help to entice you to go find them, right this very moment so that you can order that special) etc.  Overall, it is so much fun and WAY better than anything casual you can find on the strip itself. Oh! Also the prices are amazingly approachable, which is absolutely a great reason to check it out.

This is a nice, big park that is well maintained and nice to walk through.   There are tons of playing fields which seem to be in use almost constantly. When they are in use, the park is REALLY well lit, even a little later in the evening.   My little one is fascinated with sports and can occupy the better part of an hour just watching the kids practice soccer here. He also loves walking along the various ponds and enjoys playing in the small play area on the south side of the park. The play area is very small and there isn't a whole lot there to do - a few swings, a rock wall/structure that kids can climb on, and a large rock ball thing. I do like that it is filled with wood chips instead of sand (my son's shoes were empty of sand/dirt after our trip here)   The ponds throughout the park are nice - they are full of ducks and look pretty. They seem to use somewhat of a natural filtration system using plants in the shallows, which is kindof cool, and the water circulates really well which keeps the water from smelling stagnant and getting full of gunk.   All in all, a nice place to visit and I'm glad to have it nearby!

Paletas Betty totally doesn't need yet another enthusiastic review, but I can't help myself.   Located in the cute downtown Chandler area, it is walking distance from tons of little restaurants and shops. The storefront is adorable - big tall windows, a couple of tables on the patio outside and some additional tables inside. There are some cute paintings on the far wall of various Paletas-making and selling scenes - picturesque and perfect.  The menu is a digital readerboard and is a little tough to read - it flips through the various flavors, listed with the flavor names in Spanish and the descriptions in tinier writing underneath. I usually have to watch the rotation and reread the descriptions a few times before I'm able to determine what I actually wanted.   I'm not always a big popsicle fan - melty sticky sugar water on a stick has never been a big favorite of mine. I was drawn into Paletas Betty by the fact that they use real ingredients and that a million billion yelpers can't possibly be wrong.   We frequent a few of the restaurants nearby and one of our favorites (San Tan Brewery) has a rather lackluster summer dessert offering. After ordering their Blondie and being disappointed more than once, we finally decided to search for an alternative sweet treat destination. Paletas Betty was oh-too-convenient, amazingly delicious, and the price is more than right.   On our first visit, we tried the Pineapple (sweet and tart, just perfect!) and the Mexican Hot Chocolate (also amazing - the spice mix incorporated into the creamy chocolate makes for a nice complex flavor that I couldn't get enough of)   On subsequent visits, we've tried Orange Cream, Strawberry Cream, Raspberry, and Butter Pecan. They were all really delicious. I'm always so torn on whether to return to a previous favorite or try yet another new flavor... its a tough decision :) Luckily, at $2.75 each, they are inexpensive enough that we can make plenty of visits without breaking the bank.   There are a few little touches that make them unique and fun: each popsicle has a little "bite" out of the corner - so cute! and the popsicle packages have a purple Paletas Betty sticker that can be removed and stuck to a toddler's t-shirt, the wall, etc.   Service has always been good - there has been a younger girl working the counter each time we've been in, and the last couple of times she's recognized us (you're back again? :)  )   I wish they had a "kid" size for the popsicles - the regular size is a bit unwieldy for my 3 year old, but he's at a point where he doesn't really want to share with mom and dad. That's really my only complaint, and even that is a stretch.   If you haven't been, please go try one and pick one up for me while you're at it!!

It does not get better than this place, seriously.  Patisserie Manon is located downstairs on the far left side of the building behind Flemings at Charleston and Ft. Apache.   The location is a bit diabolical as it is situated just beneath a few personal training studios - confronting someone with the option of delicious, beautiful French pastries right after an exhausting hour long workout just is NOT playing fair.   That said, it is equally delicious when you are not famished. It is set up in two parts, really. The front register is for the bakery case - there are a number of different pastries in the case - eclaires, macarons, slices of cake, croissants, tarts, and more. They are pretty reasonably priced (around $4 each) and perfect for a sweet treat to enjoy there or to go.   You can also purchase cakes at the front - their cake cooler is always worth a peek as they really do a gorgeous job with decorating. Lots of great colors and flourishes. These cakes are AH-mazing. My favorite is the Tobli cake. I bought it by accident once because it was the least expensive chocolate flavored cake in the case and I didn't want to spend the money on the more expensive truffle cake. It is called "Tobli" because it incorporates elements from the Toblerone Candy Bar - so chocolate and peanuts. There are crispy nougatey layers alternated with generous dollops of to die for chocolate cream filling, and dusted with more chocolate cream and peanuts.  I've since bought this cake a few times for various occasions and everyone absolutely loves it. Additionally, I purchased two of their Bouches de Noel (Christmas Logs) which are "rolled" sponge cake filled with frosting and decorated really cutely with a "log" exterior and little woodland animals. Super cute and a perfect hostess gift for the holidays.  The back section of the restaurant is focused on the savory yumminess - breakfast is nice - they serve a few different egg dishes with their amazingly flaky and buttery croissants, along with delicious quiches (the salmon and vegetable quiche special I had once was surprisingly amazing) Their soups are also quite good and my husband always ordered the "French Hotdog", which was a hot dog sliced and served on baguette with bechamel sauce - super yummy. Warning: the hot dog itself is not very high quality, but the rest of the dish is good enough, and novel enough, that it is still okay. If you're having both a meal and dessert, you usually order your meal and your dessert from the separate areas, not all on one tab.   The staff are typically very nice - there are some who don't always come across as super friendly and there are occasionally waits, but I've honestly never had a bad experience there and anytime there is a wait, I can understand why (they have a lot of diners, or few employees, etc)   The drink selection is the one downfall - for example, they don't currently carry any orange juice (or a selection of other juices), which is a bit odd for a place that is open for breakfast.   Price: The pastries and savory food are a deal - very reasonable. The cakes are pretty expensive, but worth it in my opinion as they are unique, fresh, and delicious - your guests will talk about a cake from Manon for weeks.   Cake Tip: The "servings" listed on the cakes are pretty generous - a "4 serving" cake serves at least 6, a 6 serving cake probably serves 8-10 slices, etc.   In conclusion, if you have not been here, please go, it is great!

My favorite Market ever - the location is perfect, right behind Gilbert's mainstreet. There is PLENTY of parking (which is great) in a large lot just across the street.   The perfect Gilbert Saturday is a stop in to Liberty Market for breakfast, then walk over to the Gilbert Farmer's Market, with a quick stop off at the water fountains beneath the water tower to appease my little one :)   The setup is ingenious - it is in a large parking lot that has coverings that are used as shade for the booths. The slightly modern look to the shades keeps them visually unobtrusive.   The Gilbert Farmer's Market has a really nice selection of vendors - several places for produce (the best part of a farmer's market) We usually shop at One Windmill Farm for veggies for the family (especially perfect for baby food for my son) Also the Farm at Agritopia, Bravo Farm, Desert Roots Farm - all awesome. I'd been buying produce at Whole Foods for so long and I cannot believe how much less expensive it is to shop at the Market. Plus I feel great supporting local business and eating food that is grown nearby that tastes great.  In addition to the farmers, there are several bakers, lots of artisanal food items (salts, salsas, pastries, hummus, falafel) - I love the Pineapple Pepper Jelly from Grandma's Kitchen. Also, some arts and craftsy stuff (probably my least favorite part), and OH! meat... Doublecheck Ranch offers free range grass fed beef, chickens, etc and they have a fish vendor as well that sells Salmon, Crab, Sole, etc.   There is often a small petting zoo put on which my son loves - there are usually a bunny, a pig, goats, chickens... and they're all really SOFT and super tame.   Most, if not all of the vendors accept credit cards, which is nice because I always have anxiety about not having enough cash on me when I go to things like this.  So, I definitely recommend it and think that everyone should support local agriculture as much as possible, its totally worth it :)

Press is located in the Scottsdale Quarter and is a great little spot for something quick and delicious.   They have excellent coffee - my "go-to" is an iced mocha with skim milk. IMO, the coffee is strong! But delicious.   Better than the coffee are the breakfast sandwiches and burritos - I love that you add a sauce/spread to the sandwich - pesto, sundried tomato, etc . It really adds a nice element that you don't find elsewhere. Additionally, the baked goods: cookies, breads, and muffins, are all yummy, but also calorie-ful.   Pricing is a little high but not extreme - really it is consistent with the location being in North Scottsdale.  The restaurant has nice seating inside and outside and offers free wifi (the password is "greatcoffee". I think they recently swapped out the soft chairs and couches for regular tables/chairs instead.   Oh! And they have a frequent guest program... no cards/punches, they just take your name each time you get a coffee and you eventually earn a free one. Make sure to mention it each time, as I have had a few that were missed because I didn't bring it up to the cashier.  Service is normally nice - they get quite busy and sometimes it feels a bit rushed, but never rude.  If you're in the Quarter and looking for a nice spot, definitely stop in!

Babystop was another random find while I wandered the Agua Caliente shopping center the other day. This new location apparently JUST opened within the last two weeks and it is lovely!   It is a nice, roomy space lined with shelving that is stuffed with various toys, books, and baby accoutrements. The showfloor itself is arranged with little vignette setups of different nursery and bedroom ideas. Everything is beautifully styled and the furniture is high quality and pretty. There was a LOT of bling and I was struck by the predominance of girly and gender neutral nursery options with fewer boy options (at least at my first glance)   The thing that stood out to me most was actually the customer service of the saleswoman in the store when I visited. When I entered, she was helping an expectant couple consider various crib and bedding options. She did take a moment to greet me, which I appreciated, but then returned to her conversation with them (which I proceeded to eavesdrop on since I was the only other customer in the store and couldn't really avoid doing so) Her descriptions of the features of each crib, the options for different colors, finishes, and bedding as well as her suggestions and upselling of various elements - plush animals, decor - were all spot on and convincing. She took time to talk with them and feel them out about what they were looking for and then made recommendations based on those preferences.   Having been through a similar process at Babies R Us a couple of years ago, where the sales person I worked with was basically a glorified order taker for my $2000 purchase of nursery furniture (a person who was surly, distracted, and slow), I truly appreciated seeing someone take the time  to really make the shopping experience a good one for these guests, even before the customer chose to buy from her. The pricing is likely a bit higher at BabyStop, but between the quality of their products and their staff, I can believe that it is worth it!   Their selection of toys, books, and gifts was unique and they had a great selection of Petunia Picklebottom diaper bags displayed front and center at the entry. I can imagine this being an excellent choice to find a special shower or baby gift for a friend or loved one.   I used to shop regularly for baby items at Giggle at the Scottsdale Quarter and was so disappointed that they closed a month or so ago. Although the aesthetics are very different (Giggle being more modern/minimalist, Babystop being more classic/elaborate) I would definitely recommend Babystop and plan to check it out again the next time I need to make a baby related purchase.

We had brunch here for the first time last weekend and it is SUCH a cute little place. Very quaint and unpretentious both inside and out, with eclectic decor and classic music playing (we heard several Beatles tunes while dining)  The staff are very nice - we were welcomed right away by a gentleman who seemed to be the owner or at least manager. He made sure to point out the breakfast items on the boards and made some recommendations when he noticed that it was our first time there.   There is a counter right by the kitchen as well as a bar top within the dining room. Additionally, there are several 2-top tables set along a banquette on one wall. We did not sit out on the patio but it seemed cute - it is tucked behind the restaurant, the seating is not in front as is pictured in some of the Yelp pictures.   We ordered the breakfast burrito, banana nutella crepes, and the simple breakfast (I can't remember what it was technically called - eggs, bacon, toast) The breakfast burrito was a good size and came with a little dish of salsa - I felt it definitely needed the salsa to complete the flavors of the dish (the burrito was a little bland but the ingredients were all good) The banana nutella crepes were yummy (it is hard to complain about nutella for breakfast) and the eggs/bacon/toast dish did it's job. The coffee was delicious. The only downer food-wise was the blueberry scone: it was a bit dry and not super flavorful.    Pricing is pretty high ($36+tip for 3 of us), especially for a place where you need to help yourself to silverware (set up on a station to the side of the entryway) and that doesn't provide some small niceties like butter (for the scone) automatically.   Lastly, we brought our 1-year old son, as we are wont to do for weekend brunch, and after ordering we discovered to our dismay that they do not have highchairs at the restaurant. We had not brought a stroller, because it is usually so bulky that it inconveniences other patrons, so we did not have a great solution for corralling a very busy toddler. We managed though, creating a space for him in the corner of the banquette, but it definitely made for a less relaxing brunch than we would have liked, especially at that price point. Now, perhaps it is one of those places that proudly does NOT encourage children (in fact there is actually a sign on the back porch that says "unattended children will be given espresso and a kitten", which is good natured but still pointed :) )   Anyhow, it was a nice spot, very picturesque with yummy food and coffee, and we will likely go back - perhaps with out of town guests  and when we can leave our peanut with sitters so that we won't have to stress about seating for him.

I just visited Flict for the first time earlier this week. I had noticed their excellent reviews here on Yelp and also love the fact that they have some later-evening hours during the week! This is a lifesaver for me as I work far away and don't always have time to get in on a weekend.   They are closed Sunday and Monday, so I called on Tuesday in hopes of grabbing a Wednesday appointment. They called me back mid-day on Wednesday and I was able to get in for a 7:30 appointment that evening with a stylist named Sara. The lady who left me a message and who I later spoke with on the phone (I believe her name was Zooey) was very bubbly and cheerful.   The salon is located in the shopping center overlooking the little lake at Dobson and Ray. I was familiar with it because we've visited the Coffee Rush location as well as Sprouts there a few times :) I had never noticed Flict before and couldn't believe that such a cute little place was tucked into a little strip mall.   The look of the Salon is very un-Arizona - brick walls, shabby chic decor with funky art and reclaimed doors throughout. It was evening when I visited, but there seemed to be an ample amount of windows that must make the light during the day absolutely lovely. It reminded me of a loft-style space in an older city, which is an impressive accomplishment considering how "Beige and boring" so many AZ businesses are.   Sara, my stylist was quite nice. She asked good questions and took my lack of direction (I'm horrible at explaining what I want) in stride, making some good suggestions and ultimately providing a cut that was just what i needed. She was young and made a little bit of conversation as she cut my hair, but wasn't overly chatty.   No attempts at upselling product, which surprised me as it seems to always be the norm in salons. Perhaps she took me at my word that I don't really use much; works for me!   The cost was fine - $45 for the cut. She did let me know that that night was actually the last night she was working at Flict. I swear I'm cursed! At least she let me know :) I've been to 4 different salons since moving back and each time I find someone, they're gone by my next visit. I guess it is the norm in the business here. The one thing I'd say is that since I did let them know that I hadn't been in before, I'm surprised that they'd schedule me with someone who wasn't sticking around. It seems like it would be a good idea to get a new customer hooked on someone who would stay at the salon to increase the chances of return business.. but who knows...  Anyhow, I'd most likely return to Flict again if it remains convenient for me as far as location and timing, because it really is a cute place and they seem to have things "together"... I am just still trapped in search of a stylist that I can stick with.

Tom's Thumb was an unexpected delight! I'm upset with myself for waiting so long to try it.   I work just a couple of miles away and took a quick jaunt over on my lunch break earlier this week. It is not one of those places that you would just stumble upon as you're driving past - it is situated within a large gas station and car wash, so you either need to be looking for it or have a serendipitous discovery while waiting for your car's besparkling to conclude.   That said, it is really surprising little treat. There seem to be a few ways into the building - I happened to park near a doorway by the outdoor restaurant seating and ducked in through there. I ended up in the midst of their little "dining room" and found my way to the counter on the right to order lunch (there is another counter on the opposite side which is where you can order desserts or coffee)   I was greeted by a friendly employee as I entered and the employee I ordered from was proactive and helpful as well! I got their Tom's Choice Brown Bag special - $10 includes a pulled pork sandwich, a bag of chips, and a fountain drink. While I feel that overall their pricing is a little bit steep for what it is, I think that this is a very good value. The sandwich is generously sized on a delicious, soft bun and comes with a small cup of fresh slaw (dressed in vinegar, not mayo) along with some garnish (pickles and onions, I think) The slaw was delicious!!   The Pulled Pork was awesome - nice smoked flavor, moist without being soggy and not too dry/hard. The portion was huge - I ate the sandwich and still had pork left over to enjoy with a fork and knife.  They have a wide selection of barbecue sauces - I tried 4 on my visit: The Hickory, which is a pretty straightforward sweet/smoky barbecue sauce that was quite yummy, the Low Country, which has bacon in it and was very flavorful and savory, the Habanero, which they describe as "3 Alarm" - it was the perfect level of spiciness, with a kick but not enough to burn your mouth off, and my favorite, the Carolina, which is an almost-clear brown liquid that is really delicious and makes the already amazing pulled pork all the more flavorful and moist - it is amazing!  The chips and soda are your standard gas station/sandwich place fare - the soda is from one of the large fountains where you can select your type of soda and then add all sorts of flavorings to it. The one on the left was a little annoying as the touch screen didn't work super well. The chips were of the bagged variety - I think they were Ms. Vickers or similar. I did enjoy using the chips to dip into the remaining barbecue sauce - very yummy!  I also stopped over and got a chocolate-chip toffee cookie to go - it was great! A bit crispy, which I like, and chock full of toffee/chocolate pieces. They had a variety of other desserts that did tempt me - a bourbon pecan tart, a s'mores bar, along with various macaroons and additional cookies (some of which looked to be gluten free!)   The "restaurant" counter and dining room are so cutely decorated! It is a bit surreal to have lunch while sitting amidst a gas station, but they do a nice job of visually separating the space without actually partitioning between the areas. The décor is rustic/southwestern with a kick - I love the huge crystal chandelier, the chalkboard signs, and pallet-wood benches for the banquette-style tables. I would normally worry that a restaurant set within a busy gas station/car wash/market would feel a bit overwhelming and chaotic, but my dining experience was serene and quiet, with no real disruptions. Additionally, it was very clean. There were employees circulating continuously to clear the tables and check to see if guests needed anything.   If you find yourself in North Scottsdale or are in search of delicious BBQ here in the valley, I would highly encourage you to check out Tom's Thumb for a wonderful meal! Go in with your expectations in the right place (This is not a fine dining restaurant but it is also unlike any other place I've been) and you will likely be blown away!

A really wonderful church.   The people are very kind, friendly, and welcoming. The church staff, from the lead pastor, to the elders, to interns are always very present throughout all of the Sunday services and often stop people to say hello and chat. The church is made up of lots of ASU students, but as it has become more established the presence of multi-generational families is definitely becoming more obvious, particularly at the earlier services.  The worship is quite contemporary and varied, with different instruments and styles from week to week. There are often classic hymns that are spun with a completely new, upbeat sound which is a fun approach. The musicians are all obviously very talented and overall have a great sound.   The children's program is excellent and very organized. They have a system set up to where you sign your child up and then each week, you scan a keychain card to check them in. A sticker prints out with their name and number and you are given a corresponding sticker. They also use wristbands to notify their staff of any allergies or medical needs for a particular child and will sticker anything you leave with your child (a diaper bag, for instance) The staff are all very sweet, the ratio of teachers to children is perfect, and they are obviously passionate and loving with the kids.   The grounds and building are a bit older and show some wear and tear, but there is a lot of space which allows for all of the classrooms and activity space you could possibly need, plus a gym and playing fields as well. There is plenty of parking (although the parking lot could use some repairs!) Everything is quite comfortable and nice.   The church has its own online community called The City where you can stay in the loop on various meetings, activities, and volunteer opportunities. The main church website is also attractive and has lots of information, including the ability to download podcasts of the weekly sermons if you have to miss a week but want to stay caught up on the messages. Overall, the church is a warm, lovely place and has created a framework of excellent resources that makes it so easy to enjoy attending and being a member.  We have always traveled quite a bit to attend the church, from visiting once a month when we lived in Las Vegas to know commuting in from South Gilbert every week and it is completely worth it!   I definitely recommend it as the perfect spot for any church needs, from calling it your church home to checking out the whole "Christianity-thing" to seeking a spot to find friendly faces and support.

LOVE Crepe Bar!   So excited that this place recently opened in my old Tempe stomping grounds - if only it had existed while I attended high school nearby :)   Crepe Bar offers both savory and sweet crepes and both aspects of the menu are enticing.   On the savory menu, I've had both the Chicken Pesto and Papa K, which were delicious.  The Chicken Pesto has more muted flavors, but is crazy satisfying. The cheddar cheese is delightfully crispy at the edges of the crepe (my favorite part!)   The mushroom ragout that is part of the Papa K has amazing flavor that I can't get out of my head - highly recommend!   I've had the Vanilla Bean Custard with Strawberries for dessert multiple times - I find that the addition of Valhrona chocolate is absolutely integral to a particularly delicious sweet ending to your meal at Crepe Bar.   Something that I really enjoy is their presentation - the plates are absolutely beautiful. Considering that the prices are about $8ish a crepe, that is impressive and lends to the feeling of a very upscale experience, even in such a fun, casual setting.   The service at the restaurant is wonderful - the employees are friendly, solicitous, and accommodating. Keep in mind though, it IS a counter-service restaurant, where you place your order at the cash register and your food is delivered to you. When you order multiple courses, they try to space it out, but on both of my visits our dessert arrived prior to our entrees being completely finished. Also, the food typically takes awhile to arrive initially (even when the restaurant isn't uber busy)   The drink selection is a bit odd... coffee is obviously their deal and they appear to be very committed to the art of coffee, which is commendable. I will say that the non-coffee offerings suffer a bit ... there aren't any fountain drink options, but they do have a few bottled sodas available in a cooler beside the register (the "microbrew" rootbeer they offer is very good - tastes just a little herbal and is delicious) This detracts from the experience somewhat because the restaurant is very warm - and the alternative to sitting inside the somewhat stuffy dining room is to sit outdoors, which is also often very warm. The drinks from the case are coolish, at best, which means that, combined with the hot temperatures, there isn't a chance for a particularly refreshing, cold drink (especially after waiting awhile for your meal) Sooo... that's a little disappointing.   Lastly, they don't allow modifications. At all. After working with Chefs for a living, and eating at many, many restaurants where I've learned that it is in my interest to trust the professionals, I am absolutely a proponent of "Chef knows best". I also know that with a small kitchen and labor intensive dishes, special requests and changes can be very challenging. So I get it - I get why you would try to be up front and strongly discourage modifications. BUT I think that sticking to that policy without exception comes across as pretty customer unfriendly... especially when it is something basic, like instead of chocolate on the side, requesting nutella (an ingredient that is offered with another crepe)? But again, I do get it...  Anyway, Crepe Bar is great! Such a wonderful addition and I can't recommend it enough - very unique, well executed and just so much fun.

Hubby and I had a date night at Searsucker this past weekend and it was awesome!   I had visited one time before for an event, but this was my first "sit down" meal at the restaurant. We had a 9:00 reservation and were seated right away at arrival.   The dining room is modern and unique, with a nice bar, some loungy couch seating beside some wingback chairs and coffee tables, and a typical dining area. The chairs are mismatched which would usually drive me nuts but worked in the space. The chandeliers are rope-y (presumably as a nod to the Southwest) The music was loud when we arrived but chilled out a bit once the DJ started at 10 - this surprised me! The crowd was pretty eclectic, running the gamut from a group of bachelorettes (Who couldn't seem to stay seated at their table) to a dinner party of septegenarians in expensive pantsuits.   Our server stopped by pretty promptly to take our drink order, and a runner brought our drinks to the table shortly thereafter - he set them down along with an order of their Cheese Puffers (they reminded me a bit of the Cheesy biscuits at Red Lobster, which might seem like a backhanded compliment but seriously, those are the only things that can get me into a Red Lobster, and they a freaking addictive, so it is actually high praise)   Then... we didn't see our server for awhile. Like, at all. Nowhere to be seen in the whole dining room. It got to a point where I began to get anxious when Matteo, a floor manager, popped by the table to check in and make sure that everything was good. I briefly mentioned that we were just waiting for our server to come to take our order and he immediately apologized and offered to go ahead and take the order from us. He was kind and hospitable and got us completely taken care of - I mentioned that we planned to order several appetizers "tapas style" and he handled that with aplomb, suggesting that since our table was so small, he would course out the items to leave us enough space to dine. This was a perfect solution and was greatly appreciated.   We ordered a variety of items: Steak Tartare with Taro Chips and Quail Egg - YUM! Super flavorful and a perfect portion size. It was a bit on the salty side, but I think that this just enhanced the beef instead of overpowering it.  Bacon + Eggs - Pork Belly, toast, and a perfectly poached egg... this was really good! I love me some breakfast for dinner, so this was my kind of dish.  Farmbird Meatballs with Snake Bite Sauce and Blue Cheese Fondue - I had these on my first visit and they're what brought me back - amazing! Their version of Buffalo chicken, the combination of flavors is just perfect. The sauce on the meatballs definitely has a kick which is perfectly neutralized by the blue cheese fondue. The portion is nice - 5 good sized meatballs. Tons of flavor - absolutely recommend these. Chicken + Waffle - yet more breakfast for dinner, just my style! Nice combo of salty/sweet. The chicken was moist, the waffle was tasty.   Dessert - We shared the King sundae, which included peanutbutter cup icecream, bacon caramel, whipped cream, and bruleed bananas. Hubby was in seventh heaven.   The service during the remainder of our meal was perfectly timed - the runner who took care of our drinks was well spoken and attentive and our server checked in with us a few times to be sure all was good.   I've been looking forward to Searsucker for awhile and after this experience, I really can't wait to come back again.

We arrived to the quaint little street just past Old Town and it was immediately charming, lined with attractive businesses and lit by the glow of twinkling lights strung across the lane, with the retro-awesomeness of Valley Ho looming at the end of the street. The parking scenario is not pleasant -there was a  vacant,ghetto-ish valet stand propped haphazardly out into the street. We did a quick driveby just in case regular parking became evident elsewhere, but eventually gave up and returned to valet. It was difficult to tell where we needed to pull up, and then we waited a significant amount of time before finally being greeted by the valet. The valet himself was curt and unfriendly, and when we returned at the end of the night we once again had to wait an interminable amount of time before we were finally able to get our car. Anyway, we meandered past the lovely garden to the hostess stand, where we were greeted and advised that there would be a wait for a patio table. We're not typically picky about where we sit, so we suggested we'd sit inside if they had tables ready? They did, so we did.   After being seated on a banquette at a 4-top table in close proximity to other diners, our server swung by to say hello. It was pretty obvious from the outset that our server was new - she just didn't quite have the polish that the setting (and prices) set the stage for. She gave us a very short explanation of the restaurant (second oldest house in Scottsdale) and took drink orders. We picked up a little bit more information from the server taking care of the table beside ours, who animatedly launched into a detailed description of some of the history and the concept of the restaurant. It sounded interesting!  Our appetizers came out very quickly : I had just quietly commented to my husband that it made me sad that nice restaurants which are at least slightly French-influenced don't send amuse bouches anymore when ta-da! Out came an Amuse Bouche from the Chef: Cheese Puffs that were delicious. It was very nice and obviously I had to eat my words :) BUT it was weird that they came out after we had recieved and started on our appetizer - it was the first of some strange pacing issues during our visit. amuse bouche = yummy. Now, back to the appetizers! The House Brisket was generally tasty, although the temperature was cold (how is that possible? We had just ordered and it came out so quickly!) and they were difficult to eat - the portions weren't single bites, but they were tough to cut into and divide into smaller bites as everything just sortof pulled apart. The meatballs: When I think duck confit, I think juicy, fatty and flavor packed deliciousness. These were a bit dry, and the sauce was very thin and difficult to sop up to offset the dryness. They tasted okay but were generally a bit disappointing.   Entrees: My Filet was alright - it was cooked to temperature (medium) properly and the accompanying sauce had nice flavor. The corn on the plate seemed like a bit of a throwaway; I always enjoy sweet corn in summer dishes, but this seemed to just be a filler. My husband's braised pork was amazing - the accompanying apple and grits were just perfect and it was one of my favorite parts of the meal. The Basil and Brie Smashed Potatoes were also a let down - the potatoes themselves were very basic fingerling potatoes with little to no flavor, and they were just smashed a little (I was expecting something a bit more mashed or perhaps crispy) Admittedly, Brie is not my favorite and so I avoided that element of the dish, so perhaps I was missing out on the most important flavor component..  My dessert was delightful - a pear (or apple? I'm pretty sure it was pear) upside down cake that was just so tasty. I'd go back just for that. My husband's chocolate banana budino was okay, but not super exciting. There didn't seem to be any banana to speak of, so it was basically a quality chocolate pudding.   I had mentioned pacing, our food came out so incredibly quickly, we were actually in and out of the restaurant with three courses in an hour and 15 minutes. I feel a little strange complaining about getting our food quickly, but it just seemed rushed, first with the amuse bouche and appetizers at the same time, and then followed by the rest of the courses hitting us so quickly one after the other. It is the sort of meal you want to linger over, but I felt a bit pushed to finish by the way that it was paced.  The atmosphere was a combination of nice and not-so-nice. They've done a wonderful job of transitioning the house into a beautifully furnished restaurant. . I didn't love the closeness to the other diners, especially the bachelorette parties in front of and beside us that got rowdier as the night wore on (general screechiness and shot-taking does not make for a romantic evening) The club-like music was out of character for the otherwise upscale and serious setting.   It was weird, maybe we'll try again.

This is Coffee Rush's newest location and it is a good 10 minutes closer to my house, so I am all for it!   They have the same delicious coffee drinks as the other locations, my favorites being the Black and White Frost, Mint Mocha Frost, and the Caramel Macchiato Frost. They also have yummy Italian Sodas, the best one being the "Deadly Soda", which is neon green in color and tasty in flavor :)  Go for the coffee, free wi-fi, and atmosphere as the pastries seem like throwaway stuff - cookies, muffins, cheesecake which aren't very appetizing.   The free wi-fi is great, they give you a login and password upon request when you order your coffee (one per coffee, good for a few hours)   Once again, they have a lovely patio space however it is a smoking area and so alas, we don't ever go out there as asthma and cigarette smoke don't mix well (not to mention I find it gross and unappetizing)   The dining room is nice - newer and more modern than the other locations. The configuration of tables makes it a bit tougher to aggregate tables to seat more than 2 people per table - the aisles are narrow so tacking an additional table onto one of the 2-tops means blocking the aisleway and/or infringing on the other tables' space.   Service is generally good, although not entirely up to par with the other locations - sometimes the employees are a bit sloppy with the drinks and they don't make a lot of effort to recognize people who are in regularly.   Overall, I love Coffee Rush in its several iterations and recommend it! The loyalty program is nice, I've recently taken advantage of double punch Monday a few times :)

They were great! I needed to get my fingerprints done for the background check for my new job, and I had NO IDEA where to go.   It turns out that the Scottsdale Police Department no longer offers fingerprinting to the public (not that I really wanted to go there anyway), so I turned to trusty old Yelp and found Global PI Security a few blocks from work in the Scottsdale Airpark.   They answered when I called and confirmed that they were open (they're open during regular business hours on weekdays and you just stop in - no appointments are needed) I was worried I'd have trouble finding it and asked the guy on the phone for any landmarks to help me locate their office, but was only given the (unhelpfully general) tip that they are "next to the Scottsdale Airpark"   Soooo - I went searching and did have a tough time locating the office. I eventually did find them (I know you were on the edge of your seat for a moment there... did she find them? did she get completely lost in time and space? what happened?! ... Now you know) They are in the 7807 building, which has a green rooftop/edge. There is only one sign on the building and that says Dynatek Media - if you drive into the parking lot and follow it as it wraps around the back, you can park in one of the "Visitor" spots facing the building and head down the little path - Suite 9 is an unmarked doorway on the left (there are some credit card emblems and writing that says "fingerprinting" on the outside, but no company name)   The office itself is clean and nice, and the two employees I interacted with were both quite friendly and helpful. The price for fingerprinting was $10, they accepted my credit card and needed to see my drivers license to confirm my identity for the fingerprints. Altogether the process took about 10 minutes once inside.   It was exactly what I needed and outside of having a little trouble finding it, the fingerprinting was hassle-free.

Although I am a midwesterner by birth, my first experience of Portillos was here in the Valley of the Sun.   I've been super interested to try it, but wanted to wait until the initial craziness was past.   We finally checked it out this past weekend and wow! So yummy.   Parking was crowded, but we found a spot easily enough. There is a nice patio at the front with plenty of seating and tables overshadowed by umbrellas. The restaurant is kitschy, with memorabilia covering the walls and hanging from the ceiling - Flash Gordon poster, bicycle, airplane pedal car...   The dining room is very clean and teeming with staff - we were greeted at arrival, handed paper menus, and ushered into one of two lines stretching up to the counter. We reviewed the menus and when we reached the front of the line, were directed to one of the windows to order. This whole process was a bit frenzied - we didn't really have an ample amount of time to decide on our orders before we hit the front of the line, and when we did, getting up to a window while not cutting off someone from the other line was somewhat stressful. One of our only snags during the dining experience came when we got to the counter and learned that the printed menus that we had been looking over to make our choices were NOT actually current menus. So we had to make some rapid re-selections on-the-fly.   Your order is assigned a number and you have to listen for it to be announced, then go pick it up from the window. The girls announcing that the orders are ready have funny catch phrases for each number: "Fifty Four, wait no more!" etc, which is entertaining the first 5 times you hear them (but I'll come back to this)   You pick up your orders on large trays with drink holders in each corner and reminderd me of the trays that used to clip to your car window at A&W Rootbeer stands (if anyone remembers those) They're handy for transporting your food to the table, but are very bulky and get in the way if your table is crowded, like ours was.  We ordered The Italian Beef with spicy peppers and mozzarella, a Grilled Chicken Sandwich, a Hamburger, and a few orders of crinkle french fries.   The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was pretty okay - more "meh" than amazing.   The Hamburger was good - flattened thinner, similar to other midwestern imports (Freddie's, for example) which meant that the flavor was more concentrated and it was crispier than your standard burger. The bread got very soggy and the toppings were in disarray, so it was a mess to eat.   The crinkle fries were okay - we got three orders for the 3.5 of us and I'd probably tailor that down to 2 orders (or maybe even 1) the next time. They came out CRAZY hot, too hot to eat, so we had to wait a bit before digging in. They tasted alright and had good texture, but weren't anything to write home about.  The Italian Beef was, as others say, incredibly good. The beef was sliced very thinly and then piled on thick.  It was savory, juicy, and very flavorful. The bread was pretty thin and did get terribly soggy from the juices of the sandwich. I ordered it with spicy peppers and mozzarella; the mozzarella was barely there, but I was so glad that I ordered the peppers! The juice from the peppers permeated the whole sandwich, giving an extra dimension to the flavors - the peppers themselves were not overwhelmingly spicy, which was nice. There were some little crinkly pickled carrots in the mix as well, which was weird at first but tasted fine. Eating the sandwich is tricky: it comes in two wrappers, a larger outer wrapper that is more "dry" and a more tightly wrapped inner wrapper. I took my sandwich out of the outer wrapper but kept the inner wrapper on so that it would blockade the sogginess and keep the sandwich together. This was a good move; my friend who also got the Italian Beef did NOT do this, and it was a huge mess.   The dining room is very hectic. The seating is bordered by the line of guests, the order counter, the pickup window, and the catering counter. The cacophony of the many guests plus the announcer calling out the orders is definitely less than relaxing.  Hearing "54 wait no more" 100 times while you dine is not so great. However, the decor, very friendly and attentive employees, cleanliness of the restaurant, and overall casual level of the place all make for a very fun experience that was ultimately quite enjoyable.   Pricing was okay - just over $30 for three adults and one baby, so not too bad.   The staff were phenomenal. My expectations are generally pretty low in a place that has really young employees, but you can tell that the training at Portillos is top-notch and that they ask a lot of their team. We were greeted, treated politely and professionally, attended to (they have employees bussing the tables, collecting trash as you finish) and thanked as we left.   I can definitely recommend Portillos for a delicious and lovely casual lunch or dinner. Be sure to check it out!

I had high hopes for Iceberg - it seemed like a fun idea and I was looking forward to some yummy shakes.   Regrettably, it was just not very good.  The exterior is the corner of a small strip mall, the interior is elaborately 50s dineresque.  We visited at around 9:30 or 10:00 on a weekend evening for shakes. There were NO other guests in the dining room and two employees at the register.   We ordered, the employee was a typical teenaged fastfood employee - took our order but she didn't really make any other impression other than being very casual in her speech.   We ordered shakes - I got the smaller size, my husband got the larger option. They took a looong time - probably 10+ minutes, which I thought was strange since there weren't orders in front of us.   The "shakes" looked really odd when they came out - the shake stood up above the top of the cups. Although we'd ordered different sizes, there seemed to be the same amount of shake for both - the cups were just slightly different: super weird!   In my opinion, a defining characteristic of a shake is that it is drinkable, through a straw. These were not... they were simply soft serve icecream that seemed to have been slightly mixed and then put into the cups. I got a chocolate peanut butter shake, which was chocolate soft serve mixed with a bit of peanut butter (like, Jif or something along those lines) My husband got chocolate, so it was just chocolate soft serve. The icecream itself wasn't flavorful at all, and wasn't even satisfyingly creamy.   It was altogether disappointing and I don't recommend it, unfortunately.  :(

So yummy!   I'd had Potbelly's sandwiches before when visiting the midwest, so I was thrilled that they were opening an outpost here in the Valley :)   We finally had a chance to check it out just after Thanksgiving and it was terrific. I love a good toasted sub sandwich and that is just what these are: delicious and toasty.   They have some pretty standard offerings for the actual sandwiches (I've tried the Italian, the Roast Beef, the Chicken and Cheddar, all of which are super), but I like the option of a few extras that you can upgrade to for an additional cost (bacon, for example - who doesn't love some bacon added to, well, anything?)   The toasting process really locks in the goodness, warming up the meat, making the bread a little crunchy at the edges (but still soft and chewy inside), and goo-ifying the cheese which allows it to meld with the meat and bread into one perfectly tasty unit.   Once the toasting is complete, you can add your toppings. One option is their own hot peppers. These hot peppers totally sealed the deal for me. I've had their sandwiches without them and they're good, but the flavor that these peppers added were definitely an upgrade, and the thing that'll keep me coming back.   In addition to the sandwiches, they have bags of chips, fountain sodas, a cooler full of specialty sodas, juices, and drinks, along with amazing-sounding shakes (which I haven't tried) and signature cookies.  We did not order any cookies, but the guy who helped us popped over to the table after we sat down to ask if he could give our son some mini oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Props to him both for the thought and for asking first (we of course said yes - you don't pass up free cookies!)   The staff was very nice and friendly, although their loudly tie-dyed shirts were a bit much. There was a brief serenade from one of the guys while we were dining (I believe the song was Applause by Lady Gaga) but I believe this was because it had to do with their conversation with some of the other guests, so we didn't mind too much.  The decor in the restaurant is nice; the layout is similar to many quick sandwich shops (counter, register, and soda along one wall with tables along the other), however the furnishings are nicer than the norm, the lighting is warm instead of over bright fluorescent lights, and the decorations are comfortable and unique.   Pricing is pretty typical of this sort of shop, and the fact that the sandwiches are as good as they are means that this is a good value.   I absolutely recommend checking this place out! Hopefully they'll expand into the East Valley soon so that we can stop in more often :)

What a great location!   It is pretty new, and I love it because it is super convenient to pop over on my lunch hour.   The decor is beautiful; more modern and trendy than many Pita Jungles I've been to, but in an awesome way. They have lovely and unique light fixtures throughout, and the restaurant features a pallette of silver, light blue, and grey tones throughout. There are some neat rustic accents as well, including wooden "banquette" seating on the patio that is just gorgeous. The patio is covered and can be enclosed with plastic "windows" - we sat outside on a day that was just a little cool and it was so comfortable! The indoor section opened to the patio through several sets of nanodoors, which were kept open. The patio seating was very comfortable.   We had a wonderful server who was very prompt and checked in regularly. She accidentally dropped a fork at the table next to us  (which startled everyone) but she had a great sense of humor about it, apologizing and laughing about making everyone jump a foot.   The food was great, as usual - delicious pitas and hummus. I got their Mahi Mahi with Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus, Pita Chips, and pea tendrils. It was very good, although the pita chips were heavily dusted with a red powder that covered my fingers and rubbed off on my face and clothes - I was a disaster by the end! Definitely recommend being careful with those.   Pricing is just a little high for a lunch spot, I'd be happier if the items were $1-2 less each, based on the quality, but honestly the setting and service made me overlook that completely.   If you're in North Scottsdale and want to hit Pita Jungle for lunch, definitely try this location!!

I am an unabashed Menchie's fan. Other fro-yo places need not apply. I've tried them and they just don't live up to my Menchie's-level expectations.   Their stores are sparkling clean and bright, with white as the predominant color and highlights of fun neon green and fuschia. The minimalist decor keeps the feel modern. I think they usually have about 4-5 machines with two flavors of frozen yogurt each (plus a swirl option), so a decent amount of flavors to choose from. The fro-yo is good... I don't usually get it just on its own but I can imagine it would be good if you did. For me it's all about the toppings - their topping selections are awesome - a variety of fresh fruits, nuts, sprinkles, cereal, gummies, chocolate chips, crumbled candy bars, graham cracker, cake bites... you name it. The spoons are a good size and the containers are easy to get in and out of.  Oh, and the sauces!! This location had hot fudge, peanut butter sauce, marshmallow sauce, and caramel. They're in the "fountain" type machines instead of store bought bottles (like some of the other places I've gone to)   The employees are very nice - they've been trained on the Menchie's "kool aid" and we've been wished a "smiley day" each time we've visited.   The format is the usual fro-yo place format - grab a cup ("bucket" may be a more accurate term) - I actually like getting the waffle cone or waffle divider options out of the little plastic case on the countertop. Then you choose your flavor(s), get the amount of frozen yogurt you'd like, and add your toppings. Once you've got your fro yo all set, they weigh it to determine the price, you pay, and you're golden.   The prices are good - mine is usually under $4 (and sometimes under $3), which, when compared with the cost of ice cream treats at other places (Cold Stone, Frost) at $5 or $7 each, it feels like a steal!   They also have a loyalty card which gives you $5.00 to spend after a certain dollar amount is spent ($50? I can't remember) and $5.00 to spend in your birthday month.

Well, there are (at least) two new Waffle Trucks in town: Waffle Love AZ and Waffle Crush. Both have opened within the last month-ish and they both seem to like parking in my back yard (not complaining!) Being lovers of waffles (particularly waffles of the amazingly sweet, sugary leige-sort), we of course needed to give both a whirl.  I believe that I read that Waffle Crush is run by some ladies from Queen Creek. We've visited them most often in the parking lot of the American Leadership Academy at Greenfield and Pecos - it is a pretty diabolical location as it is directly on our way pretty much any/everywhere as we head to the freeway. My young son now identifies that intersection as "Waffle" any time we pass it. They have also joined the Power Ranch Farmers Market one Wednesday, which was phenomenal as my grandmother could walk over to grab a waffle with my son (nothing else is really within close walking distance here)   Location: The two locations we've visited have been nice - American Leadership Academy's parking lot has been empty of normal traffic during the times that we've gone, which means that the only cars there are there for the Waffle truck. There's plenty of space to park and a big clear area around the truck itself where you wait. There is also a nice park just across the street, which can be a scenic place to enjoy your waffles if you don't enjoy the eat-standing-up-or-in-your car experience. The Power Ranch Farmer's Market was also nice, with a big grassy area nearby and sidewalk on the side of the truck where you ordered. Both options were well lit and they often have several lawn chairs set up for some guests to sit in while they wait.   Process: The lines are long - this is a fact. The waffles take awhile - also a fact. You generally order when you get to the window, they take your name, run your credit card on the iPad. There is a spot to provide a tip BUT I noticed that they only offer you set tip options (15%, 20%, 25%) ... not a huge fan of this as it is not a table service restaurant (they are handing me my food through a window) and so a 20 or 25% tip is WAY HIGH for the amount of actual service provided. Even 15% is a lot when 3 waffles will run you almost $25, which means that you're leaving a $4 or $5 tip for the lowest percentages.   The Menu: Your basic option is the yum-tastic Liege Waffle. They do something unique in that you can order a chocolate-filled waffle, which seems to be a waffle that is somehow layered with chocolate in the middle; yummy but SO sweet. They have some great suggested waffles - the "Berry" is my go to, with Biscoff, Strawberries, and Whipped Cream (the thick, real whipped cream that is almost like icecream but soft and a perfect topping) "Nana" is another favorite in our family, with Bananas, Nutella, and Whipped Cream. They have the "Mellow" which is s'moresish with chocolate filling and toasted marsmallows, and the perfect option for my son and grandmother who don't go overboard - the Cinnamon Sugar, which is simply the waffle rolled in a Cinnamon Sugar mix.   The Goods: The waffles are delicious Liege waffles that use special waffle irons that caramelize the sugar on the waffles providing a crispier, sweet exterior that contrasts the soft and fluffy interior perfectly. There is something to their batter that isn't my favorite - a slightly sharp after taste that sometimes puts me off, but is usually pretty well masked by the toppings so it's not that big of a deal. The toppings are delicious and the combinations they suggest are all creative and tasty.  Service: We've been several times and the faces seem to always be the same people, which is nice! They go out of their way to be friendly, and on one night where we arrived early when there wasn't much of a line, we even got a little overview and sample of the Biscoff spread form one of the proprietors.   Overall - They seem to have a good grasp on their concept and provide an excellent end-to-end experience from location to menu to service. Their prices are a little bit higher and again, the tip thing is slightly annoying, but given the choice we definitely would return here as often as they're close by! They have a punch card that we'll definitely make use of :)

I found out about Core Body Pilates a couple of months after they opened (thanks Yelp!) I was thrilled as Pilates is my favorite method of exercise and there haven't been any great spots within a reasonable distance of my house - until now! I've taken private Pilates classes at a few different studios in Las Vegas, did daily group Reformer classes at another studio post-partem, and have done group Mat and Reformer classes at a few places here in town which are too far away (The Village DC Ranch, Tempe Pilates)   Core Body Pilates offers your first class free so that you can experience the studio, which is wonderful. After the first class I signed up for the "Unlimited" package, which is $199 per month. Just a forewarning that the unlimited package is not entirely unlimited: it only covers reformer classes (not Yoga or Barre, which are also offered) and you can only take one class per day. I take about 4-6 classes per week, so the cost is worthwhile on a per class basis.   The studio is bright and contemporary and very clean. The reformers they have are neat: they combine the functionality of a reformer with elements of a Cadillac. They have a tower at the end and can convert from a movable reformer into a mat and tower, which really allows a wide range of exercises on one piece of equipment. There are 8 reformers total, so the maximum number of people in a class is 8. They offer private sessions (which I have not done) - their pricing for these is pretty reasonable compared with other places I've gone. They have a couple of Wundachairs that I've seen incorporated into group classes for circuit training (since there aren't enough for all 8 students) but I'd imagine that they make more use of them during private sessions. I have not seen a ladder barrel at the studio, so I don't think they have one for private sessions (which is too bad! Stretching and Sideovers on the Ladder Barrel are one of my favorite things)  The schedule is heavy on Jumpboard classes but also includes Tower classes and more general Reformer classes. If you are looking for very traditional pilates on a regular basis: abwork, footwork, "legs in straps", etc, you won't necessarily find that during the group classes.  There are several instructors and each one has a unique style.   Melissa, the owner and does a lot of the very early classes. She is bubbly, energetic, and her classes are challenging. Her instruction-style is very clear, she usually demonstrates the exercises along with the class but will offer corrections and modifications on certain exercises where needed. She seems to experiment with new exercises in her classes, which you'll then see show up in the other instructors' classes later.   Linda's classes are great; again they are challenging but with a focus on good form. She often incorporates some of the things that I happen to enjoy (Short spine, legs in straps) and incorporates small amounts of stretching throughout the class. She has a great energy and her classes are enjoyable.   Michelle's Saturday morning class may be my favorite. She is very focused on good form and highlights one of the best things about Pilates: that the smallest movements, done correctly, can be more challenging and successful than super heavy weights and millions of reps. Her classes are well paced but she manages to ensure that everyone receives personal attention and is doing the exercises properly. She will demonstrate but spends most of her time observing and helping students - making corrections and modifications as needed. Michelle is very well spoken and high energy.   Nataliya's classes are challenging. I've never thought of Pilates and Boot Camp as existing within the same realm, but that is the closest comparison I can draw for her classes. Heavier weights, more reps, less focus on form and more focus on getting through the exercises. If you are the type who needs to "feel it" to be happy with a workout, then Nataliya's classes may be a good fit for you.   A few things that I'd love to see in the future: some sort of expanded reception area - there are no benches outside the studio which means that if you arrive a few minutes early you have to wait outside sortof awkwardly. Creature comforts: Water (all of the other studios I've been to have either bottled water or a water cooler), a clock, and a box of tissues.   There are lots of great things about Core Body Pilates: the beautiful studio, great equipment, the very early (5am) and very late (8:30pm) class times which are amazing. They have childcare for some classes which is a unique offering and I'm sure is helpful to one of their target demographics (moms who are home with kids and need the chance to get in a good workout)  I think this studio is a great addition to South Gilbert! Based on how full the classes are, they seem very successful already and I look forward to seeing how they expand in the future.

Not super.  I love Press Coffee - it has basically spoiled me for other coffees. The original shop is cute, nice, with awesome food and coffee, so of course I was really excited at the prospect of getting some yummy Press goodness at the airport.  Alas, the airport location leaves lots to be desired. It is located in Terminal 4 by the B gates (opposite B8 and B10) It is quite small and serves wine and food in addition to the coffee stuff and pastries. I ordered my regular - Iced White Mocha with Almond Milk... no almond milk :( But not the end of the world.   The guy working was quite nice - friendly, articulate, and considerate. Offered upsells of food, wine, etc to myself and the other customers he assisted while I was there. They only had one person working, who took orders and made the coffee - that meant that the process took longer than it probably should have, but no big deal.  Their seating area is very small (5 seats at a countertop facing the walkway) and has a couple of outlets. The countertops were extremely grungy, which was pretty gross.   I got my Iced White Mocha within a few minutes and grabbed a seat. It was a tad stronger than usual, but I wrote that off as just a difference in the place. THEN I got to the bottom of the cup and YUCK! All of the syrup was gathered in what seemed to be a half-inch deep, foul tasting sludge. It was awful. Completely ruined my experience and I had to go in search of gum or some other drink to clear the grossness out of my mouth.   Also, they do not honor the frequent guest program that the original Press Coffee Shop has - not cool. When I asked about it, I was told that they don't get a lot of regulars - wha? Well, now I know why, I guess :(   Anyhow, totally sad. I am in love with this movement to capture all of the great local Phoenix spots at the airport - but not when they're poor facsimiles so far from the original that you may as well not even use the same name.  I think its a pretty new spot; hopefully they'll improve a bit over time.

I used to come to Centerpoint as a teenager - it was still a Harkins that sold raspberry spritzers in glass bottles and Toblerone candy bars. The escalators pretty much never worked, so you'd run up the stairs to your movie.  Centerpoint has come a long way since then. While I miss the old goodies of yesteryear, the upgrades to the theater are amazing amenities for my adult self. This is now an AMC (so no loyalty popcorns or sodas, unfortunately) They've changed the seating so that you now reserve your seat either ahead of time online (an extra $1.00 convenience charge) or when you purchase your tickets at the box office. I L.O.V.E. this because it means you an skip the crazy lineup for newer movies, and avoid the insane prices of iPic and the weird desk-chairs of Studio Movie Grill. Also, the prices are pretty much what you pay for a normal movie ticket at other theaters (ie. Harkins or other AMCs) - about $11 as of this writing.   They have only recliner seats in all of the theaters. The recliners are pretty comfortable - a red pleatherish material that has been clean on all of my visits. The seats each have cupholders on the generous armrests and one armrest can pop up so I can hog my hubby's seat as well. The recliners don't have a crazy long leg support (even with my short legs, my feet usually still hang off the edge a little bit) BUT the space between the end of the recliner and the seat in front of you still allows enough room for someone to move past without having to constantly move your seat if someone gets up in the middle of the movie. It is a stadium-style setup in that you don't have to worry about being able to see over the person in front of you (I haven't had any issues, and as I've mentioned - I'm short) but isn't crazy steep to the point where you feel like you're hiking up and down the theater to get to and from your seat. The recliners have been a lifesaver recently as I had knee surgery and would not have been able to comfortably make it through a 2 hour movie in a normal theater.   The concession stands are pretty normal; the usual concessions, the usual inflated movie theater prices. I love that they have self serve soda fountains both downstairs and upstairs. They have a deal with two sodas, popcorn, and candy that seems like a pretty good value (we always come to late night movies and aren't hungry enough for all that stuff!)   These days, it seems like they're doing a good job of keeping the escalator working. However, I don't believe it has been cleaned since my teenaged visits 12 years ago ... lots of gross looking debris caked into the ridges... wish they'd go ahead and deal with that.   Service is generally decent - the kids working seem pretty nice, and they always wish us a good night as we leave.   They have a little machine that will validate your parking in the parking garage, which is very nice (having to pay for parking would be the only thing that would steer me away from coming to this theater, so I'm glad I don't have to worry about it)   My only complaint (other than the gross escalator) is that the temperature in the theaters is often uncomfortably warm. It seems to be more of a consistent issue in the theaters at the end of the upstairs hallway (theaters 5 and 6, I think) This is definitely something they should work on, as there's really nothing worse than sitting through two hours of movie in a muggy, hot, theater.
