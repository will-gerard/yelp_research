I'm sooo excited to be writing my first review here!  Firefly on Paradise was amazing.  I went based on lots of people's reviews here and loved it.  The place was definitely packed and I was glad I had called for reservation for the party of 4.  The food was great!  I had been missing Spanish food since I came back from Spain and the food here definitely hit the spot.    The boquerones were traditionally done and were delicious.  The stuffed dates are to die for and a must-have.  We even tried it without bacon since we had someone following kosher diet in our group.  The veggie empanadas were also very tasty.  Another traditional spanish dish is the patatas bravas.  They made them very much like the ones I had in Spain though I would have liked them a bit spicier.  To compliment all the delicious food, we also enjoyed a couple of pitchers of sangria.  The service was good all the way through.  I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!

5 Stars for service, food, ambience, decor and an overal great experience.  This was the one splurge for our Vegas trip and I've been following every episode of Top Chef, we chose Craftsteak.  The decor is elegant, unpretentious and very comfortable for a group to carry a conversation.  There were three of us and we were seated at a booth (which I love!).  We didn't go for the tasting menu which I kind of regret now...   All three of us ordered the grilled kobe skirt steak since none of us wanted to share.  We had a choice of several kobe beef and went with a medium priced Wagyu beef from Australia.  We all ordered it medium-rare and every single one came out perfectly cooked.  The meat was flavorful, tender and juicy (even the next day left-overs were!).  For sides, we got the puree, green beans and asparagus.  Everything was very simply made and with good flavor.  Overall, great experience and one of the best steak houses.

I can't say I've ever had British food before but if pasties are a good representation of British food, I'm a huge fan!  My boyfriend and I came here day after our half marathon run right.  We were looking for something tasty and different to try in Arizona before we headed back to San Fran.  Based on the reviews, we picked this place and didn't regret it one bit.  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala which was perfectly cooked.  Don't know how they do it but everything was perfectly seasoned, the chicken was very tender, and the potatoes perfectly cooked.  Great meal in a pocket, my favorite kind of easy to eat fair.   My boyfriend was disappointed that they ran out of the peppered steak.  His frown was turned upside down soon enough after he had first few bites of his back-up order, Rosemary steak.  I had a bite and it was definitely was really well seasoned, beef was tender, and the flavor combination was great!  Thank goodness I planned ahead for dessert.  I only finished half of mine so I could have room for their chocolate bread and butter pudding which did not disappoint.  We had it with creme anglaise and it was a delicious decadent chocolate goodness.  Be warned, the chocolate brandy is very strong in this one.  On the service side, it wasn't a busy day and our waiter was super nice, attentive, and the food came at a reasonable time for it to be freshly made to order.   Overall a great experience, and I'll definitely come back to try a few other pasties.

I probably didn't pick the right item...  I got the gyro and wasn't impressed.  The only thing impressive was the size.  It was sadly very lacking in flavor.   Extra star for the fact that I had their roast beef sandwich as an Ironman Arizona volunteer and that one was good. But nothing I would write home about.
