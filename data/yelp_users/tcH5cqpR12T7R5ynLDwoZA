This place rocks! I have been coming here for years and the food is the best it's ever been. They recently changed their falafel and it is AMAZING. It used to be a little soft and doughy but now it's nice and crunchy  just how I like it. Harry was our bartender and the mojito he made us was so good I probably could of drank the whole punch bowl to myself  I'll def be back next time I have a falafel craving!

I usually go to the Tempe marketplace or Arcadia location. But they didn't have any available time slots so I made an appointment for me and my boyfriend to get a couples massage at the camelback location. Further drive but I thought eh it will be Worth it. The front desk agent was friendly and helpful and we went in on Sunday super excited for a relaxing massage TOGETHER. Only problem was that they don't have a couples room at that location!! I was very clear when booking that we were doing a couples massage And the front desk guy happily booked it without informing me that that wasn't even a possibility. The massage was ok. But it was hard to relax because I was frustrated that they messed up our reservations and I never got my much needed down time with my boyfriend. I will definitely reconsider coming back to this location... And might even end up cancelling me and my boyfriends memberships.

My boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch last week, he got a burger with the works and said it was the best burger he has ever had. You could tell the ingredients were fresh from the bun to the patty. The lettuce and pickles were nice and crispy and you could tell their special sauce was homemade. I had the veggie sandwitch and cheese fries and oh my god... That cheese is amazing. I asked for an extra side to smother on my sandwich I probably could of eaten it by the spoonful  we got milkshakes to go and they were a great end to an amazing meal.

I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Ryan was our server he was  informative and funny. I'm a vegetarian and sometimes find that when going out to eat I don't have many options. This place was great though.  The veggie cassolet was amazing, and the roasted cauliflower was perfection. Great ambiance and service! I will definitely be back to see Ryan!
