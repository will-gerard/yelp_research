Heard about this place but never got there until last night. Oh my gooseness, we had the Cowboy Stuff platter and it was huge. We've done our grocery shopping for the week if not the month with what we brought home. The price wasn't bad though the drinks are a little skimpy and pricey. But you are also paying for the view, ambience and service, all which were exceptional. Just might have to cowboy up and go again.

What the heck has happened to Kohl's?  A store I used to enjoy going to, that used to be organized and with salespeople that knew the product, has turned into a high priced Walmart; although Walmart is better organized (salespeople still don't know what is sold there or where to find it). The buyers (those who buy clothing for a store) are completely out of touch with the number of items a store should be stocked with, and when the trucks show up, it's a crap shoot as to what might be unloaded. Last time I was there, just a few days ago, some of the vests and bow ties were torn apart. That is if one could even find vests and bow ties. But all this reflects on management, hence, Kohl's stores need better management.

I can't believe this quack is still allowed to practice medicine. The AMA needs to find out about this guy and discipline him severely, or better yet, take away his license. His bedside manner is not about manners at all. He acts as if he were a god and we found him rude, obnoxious and so cruel as to make the expectant mother cry. Who the hell does this guy think he is? On the day of delivery, he was still short tempered and delivered the baby in such a manner as to bruise the baby's head and tear the mother's vaginal wall. Neither of those incidents needed to have happened. There are plenty of OBGYNs in the valley. Do yourself, and your baby, a favor and stay as far away from this guy as possible. He must be in it for the money, he's sure not here because he's a people person.

You might think that all strip clubs are the same, and I'll admit that I don't go on a regular basis; in fact, I rarely go at all, but I've been to enough to know quality customer service. Some girls in these establishments are there strictly for the money and their attitude reflects that, while others really enjoy dancing, mingling and providing the kind of customer service (no, not that) that will build a regular clientele. I'm happy to say that Skin Cabaret falls into this category, as the girls are friendly and outgoing. Of course, I live just down the block and am now hoping for free entrance for life! LOL Okay, maybe not for life, but a time or two.

Hey Paisan, This is as authentic as it is good. The deli sandwiches were delicious and the cannoli for desert was great. A wonderful selection of wines compliment the authentic Italian foods. We sat out on the patio which was very relaxing. Would highly recommend this place for anyone who'd like to go to Italia but can't afford the flight.

As with most businesses, there will be good and bad reviews, and hopefully I can come back at a later date to write a good one. However, my first experience with Gus' was quite negative. I ordered a pizza online, gave the card number to pay for it and received a confirmation/order number. The pizza was supposed to be delivered within an hour. An hour later, no pizza, so I called. Gus' had no record of our order, no specials and no website, or so I was told, and yet, I was looking at the website as the employee was telling me they didn't have one. I went to the bank and sure enough, money had been taken out to pay for pizza at Gus'. I called again. One of the most curious things was the different stories I got depending on the employee I was speaking to. During one phone call I was told that the order was on its way. I waited. Nothing. I called again. No record of the transaction, no order placed, no pizza on its way. I inquired how a pizza could be "on its way" if there was, allegedly, no order placed. I was placed on hold several times as the employees desperately tried to get answers to these questions they could not answer. Finally the manager. No record of an order placed, yet paid for. An interesting business practice.  Needless to say, it was a frustrating experience and an investigation is under way. The funds should be returned in 2-3 business days, but for now, I have no access to them and no pizza. Think I'll stick with Papa Murphy's; for delivery service is like a box of chocolates-- you never know what you'll get, or in this case, if you'll get.

Lowe's, as with every do-it-yourself hardware store, supplies the materials one needs to get projects done in and around the home. If you're looking for someone to do it for you, you need to hire a contractor who specializes in the project you need done. Though, as with most companies, Lowe's tries to hire and train qualified personnel, not everyone there is as knowledgeable about every department as you might hope, but this is a great opportunity for self-growth and awareness and learn somethings on your own. Patience is the key if you need questions answered as there are more people wanting info than qualified employees to give it. You'll find this the same at Home Depot as well. Personally, having worked in both Handyman and Builder's Emporium in CA, I like both stores.

Though convenient to us, this PO is experiencing some problems; possibly due to inexperienced workers? After all, all one needs is to pass the civil service exam to work there. Problem 1: "Anyone using a credit card?" I stepped out of the long line, glad there was another avenue to get my transaction done quickly. All I had to do was purchase a book of stamps and postage for a letter that needed delivery confirmation. The young man who helped me was apparently confused as to my request and by the time we were done, I could have stayed in line and been out sooner. Problem 2: We have one of those old fashion mailbox systems at our complex, where the mail person opens a row of mailboxes with a key, places the mail in their appropriate slots, then closes that row--or is supposed to. One day, the boxes were left open for almost an entire day, even after the local PO was called. Meantime, some things I was expecting in the mail have yet to arrive, or have they?

Howard runs a great club with great comedians, bringing in tried and true comics as the headliners. I've never been to a bad show here and may even try it myself. The place is clean and well laid out to make sure everyone has a great view. The entertainers are friendly and always willing to talk after the show. It's always a great time.

If you like Chicken, you'll love Chick fil A. Not only does it present chicken in a variety of ways, but the staff is friendly and they have free WiFi which is huge! They don't even require one makes a purchase in order to use it which creates good will and makes a great promotional and marketing feature. Speaking of which... I'd like to see a name the cow contest and get rid of the black shirts in favor of yellow. After all, aren't chicks yellow? Or, at least get a chick patch for the front of the shirt. I know that having employees buy their own wardrobe helps cut costs, but let's have a little fun too.

There are tanning places all over the valley, and for good reason. Too hot to lay out in the summer for very long, too cool in the winter, and sometimes you just want to tan quickly. Prices vary, as do the types of booths they have. Sunchain, I found, to be economical, friendly, helpful, and with beds that are comfy and clean. Currently, at this writing, they are doing a promo of 10 tans for $10 for 10 days. A great way to help build up or keep that summer tan. All they need now is a leg tanner and I should be there almost everyday.

Salty Se√±orita, located in old town Scottsdale, is a nice place, especially when the weather is just right and you can a meal and/or drinks on the spacious patio. The service is great though sometimes it seems that an extra server would be prudent, and though the patio is nice and heat is provided, there are a few, small metal "things" that stick up here and there that servers and customers could trip over. The food is delicious and the drinks generous, especially during happy hour. I would recommend it as a casual place to grab a bite or quench your thirst. Parking can be challenging as the parking lot for Salty's is down the block, while the next door neighbor, Buca di Beppo lays claim to some primo parking real estate.

If you're a guy, love sports and like to be pampered while getting a superb hair cut, then this is the place for you.  The first thing I noticed was how intently I was listened to as far as what I wanted in a haircut. Then there is the sports. They had the Baseball channel on, which was fine, as I love baseball, But if you ask them to change the station so you can watch football or anything else, they are happy to oblige. Hot towels for your face and even a neck and shoulder massage await you there, all free if you're a first timer. It only $4 more than Great Clips, but you get a lot more for your money.
