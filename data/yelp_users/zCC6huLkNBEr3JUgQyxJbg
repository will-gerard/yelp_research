For Review 200 I wanted to take something from my bookmark list. I was downtown for the Herberger Theater and passed by the Old Spaghetti Factory. I used to visit the OSF in Atlanta and when I lived in Ohio. I remember always enjoying the experience...  Nostalgia is better than reality.  My friend ordered the fettuccini alfredo and I went with the garlic mizithra...which is a twist on the standard mizithra cheese & spaghetti plate I typically order. This added garlic, mushrooms and bacon. The food was good, but fairly average. The portions were smaller than I remembered.   The sourdough bread was good - still warm. The restaurant opened in 1972 and I think they have been making salads the same way since Day 1. It was an iceberg lettuce classic and although I ordered blue cheese, it arrived with vinaigrette. Rather than send it back I kept the salad.   Perhaps I arrived close to a shift change, but there appeared to be 2 managers on duty, both stopping by the table multiple times to ask "is everything fantastic?" - the waiter stopped by several times as well and said "Is everything excellent?" I like to be checked on occasionally, but too much is annoying.    Another annoying aspect was the food had been on the table about 10 minutes and still was 3/4 full, the waiter came back and asked if we needed boxes or were we still working on it? Um...yes, still working.  Maybe it was because it was 5:30 and the lobby was crowded with others waiting, but I hadn't been there that long - and three minutes later when he popped back over and asked again if we were finished, well you just earned yourself a small tip and a long guest because my show didn't start for another 90 minutes and I didn't have anything to do. Deal with it.   Finally I allowed him to take the plates away and we were brought complementary spumoni - I have to say that was the best part of the entire meal. Afterwards I swung by the restroom and that was a charming experience.  Big open urinals - at least it wasn't like the old pee troughs some places used to have - but there it was - a full restroom of guys looking like a locker room. I didn't know my spaghetti came with sausage. Yuck.  Overall - $31 for a hopefully soon forgettable dining experience.  The service from the waiter and the manager(s) was annoying and the meal average at best.  Some memories are best kept as that. I don't think I need to revisit this restaurant any time soon.

That's what I'm talkin' 'bout! This place is not fully hood, but it is close. They have a large selection to chose from, and I wasn't sure what to chose until I saw a nice value menu. I finally chose the three slider option - a pork, a chicken and a beef. A large pot of sauce on the table provided the right amount of sauce to be added to the sandwiches. I was surprised at how quickly the order was ready. My friend ordered and as she was getting her soda, her number was called.   The soda selection was another interesting feature. No Coke or Pepsi here - RC, Diet Rite, Big Red, Country Time, and Sunkist mark a few of the selections that do not appear on most restaurant menus. There is plenty of seating in the dining room.  A good selection of sides to chose from (I went with the potato salad).  The flavor of the meat was excellent and each slider was overstuffed. When you see the sandwich, you know you are going to wear it - which is another sign of a great BBQ establishment. You will need plenty of napkins with this one!   My first experience here will not be my last. This place has jumped near the top of my list of BBQ pursuits.

The zoo is cool! I have enjoyed the Zoo lights in the fall in the past and this weekend visited for the giraffe encounter. I highly recommend seeking this exhibit. It is $3 in addition to the fee to get into the zoo, but it was worth it. My friend and I got to hand feed a couple of giraffes - how cool to be that close to the animals. Thankfully they also provide a spritz of hand sanitizer to get the saliva off.  The exhibit is 7 days a week 9-10 AM. Highly recommend going being this exhibit is gone. Also stop by to see the new jaguar on display.

A couple of friends and I participated in the Phoenix Actually' Great Phoenix Scavenger Hunt meeting up at the George & Dragon. The location was good - right on Central, close to light rail access. Parking was descent in the back. The bar was spacious with pool tables & darts in the entry room, plenty of seating in the dining around and around the bar. It was big enough to accomodate all of the scavengers as well as those patrons wondering what all of these other folks are doing.  Before the scavenger hunt started my friend ordered an Ace Apple Cider. I ordered one as well and it was very sweet. That drink would be dangerous because I could pound those all night not realizing it was alcohol.   We made it back to the George & Dragon a little early (8:30)...still 30 minutes left in the scavenger hunt, but the web site to upload pics to was slow, so we decided to enjoy some apps and drinks at the bar. The appetizers were typical bar food - we ordered the mozzerella sticks, potato skins and another round of Ace Apple Cider. Typical, but tasty. The cheese sticks were very cheese and the 'skins were good. The plate game with a few garnishes of vegetables as well.   The service was excellent too. We were going to order the shrimp, but the waitress indicated there really isn't that many, so perhaps another selection would be better. She was very prompt despite the large crowd. I left a good tips due to the attentiveness and advice.  I love pubs in general and would definitely go back any time.

I took my girlfriend here for a performance of Romeo & Juliet. This was our second time going to the Opera (we saw Faust last year through Yelp).  Both performances we have seen here have been excellent - the cast is great and the location is very convenient. This time our seats were very close, which maybe was a bit too close. There is a large board above the stage that provides translations (and since I speak English and she speaks Spanish it would be helpful). Our seats were really too close to benefit from seeing the screen. Fortunately the cast does an excellent job at bringing delivering the emotions of the scene well even if the audience doesn't know the language.   The coffee/drink bars and the props from other shows in the lobby also provide good relief during the intermissions. The restrooms seem to move quicker than they do at other theaters in the area. Both times have been excellent and we will definitely return.

A friend of mine is in town and staying at the Ritz Carlton on Camelback. In meeting up, we ventured across the street and found Sam's Café. The menu was big and many things looked good. I was busy looking at the spacious dining area and the food options when the waitress arrived. My friend went with the raspberry margarita while I had  1/2 coke,  1/2 diet coke.   The waitress was very attentive and dropped by many times to make sure we were fine. The chips and salsa were amazing! I saw some Yelp reviews on my phone that talked about the chips. I thought really? They are chips! Can they really be that exciting? Damn skippy! In fact, most of the time I didn't even put them in salsa-  they were so good just by themselves.   My friend ordered the Red Rock Meatloaf served with peppers, bacon and onions, mashed potatoes and she swapped spinach in place of the corn on the cob. I went with the Applewood Smoked Pecan Salmon. Damn! It was salmon with pecans, there was a side spinach and the salmon was served on a bed of mashed sweet potatoes and a red papaya and serrano chile sauce. I detected something else that seemed like slightly spicy apple sauce, but I don't know what it was.  An excellent meal, nice atmosphere, descent area and above average service. Each entrée was about $17 and the margarita was $6.50. No room for dessert - with the exception of the white chocolate tamale brought out with the bill, but the tray showed several items. Maybe next time?

I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. I have frequently commented that the number of good BBQ joints in Phoenix is lacking. This is located in a small shopping area just down from my office and today I decided to stop by with a friend rather than my typical drive past.  We arrived at a great time - just seconds before the long line formed. She ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I went for the same but Tennessee style (that's topped with slaw for y'all from from the south). David B. described the quality of food in relationship to the decor. Another indicator is the level of sloppiness. When I slowly opened the aluminum foil and saw the saucey/cole slaw mess, my expectations increased. The sandwich was of large size and presented a dilema for me and my dining partner (perhaps more for her as she was wearing a nice business suit) - do we dive in and end up wearing half it on our pants and shirt, or should we be civilized and use a knife and fork. Yes, the alternative would require both utensils. Given we had several work hours left in the day, we elected the later. The flavor was excellent. The saucy perfect and the slaw set it off just right.   Two large sandwiches and two medium drinks - just over $13. I was seriously eyeing that piece of sweet potato pie or the brownie...who am I kidding? AND the brownie...but I refrained.  I have to put this spot near the top of my Phoenix BBQ locations. I will definitely come back again.

I do fly frequently and I am not really a fan of PHX. Where do I start? Driving to the airport is easy. It is centrally located and I would rate it high in the convience department. After that, it's downhill. I don't park there -  I use a shuttle service such as the Parking Spot and get dropped off right out front. Much easier. Inside the terminals are good, most of the times the lines move, although why people cannot figure out how to use the self check kiosks, I don't know. It isn't rocket science. Security lines are rarely long and move quickly, but once inside you are stuck with limited services. Sure there are stores and Dick Clark's on the outside, but be prepared to fly hungry or wait in long lines on the inside. I fly Delta a lot and in terminal 3 you have a choice of Wendy's or the blue burrito...or vending machines...maybe pick up something at the newsstand...  For me the major issues are driving through the airport. The terminals are not user friendly. They are adequately marked 1-4 and have north side and south side. When picking up someone ask which door number they are coming out of - because you cannot stop long. Once the wheels on the bus stop going round and round security emerges as if by magic to instruct you to keep moving. Sit there and ignore them long enough and the ticket book appears - that's when it;s time to circle again (thanks, Bin Laden). Terminal three has one inconvenient turn while you are waiting for emerging traffic during your continual loop of the terminal - I have almost been t-boned a few times there. Another thing I don't like is their short term parking - it appears instantly and goes up a ramp. It is always in a spot I am not thinking it should be, so I miss it. Instead use the cell phone lot and wait for your party to call, circle around and take your chances with security.  On a positive note, the airport is a great place to people watch. I always follow the guideline of 2 hours early, so I get to sit and watch. People hanging in the bar getting drunk and forgetting they are flying when their name is paged, people late and OJ'ing it through the concourse, people wearing interesting outfits and being an international airport, you can see people from all over the world. Not to mention the occassional disruptions - is it a wonder SouthWest made a reality show about people in the airport? If you don't mind being hungry and bored, arrive early and watch the people. Some of them are worth the price of a ticket!

I have wanted to go to the Stockyard, but had not previously had the pleasure. I don't want to drive back toward work and try a pricey restaurant that might not be worth the trip. Rachael Ray recommends trying a place for lunch when it is cheaper and less of a wait - so that is what I did today. One area where Rachael's advice was incorrect was the wait - Friday during lunch was very busy. When I entered the host recommended that I go to the bar because the dining area was already full. The bar contains seating as well as seats at the bar itself.  With the available seating taken, I bellied up to the bar at looked over the lunch menu. A positive note is that the menu is the same in the bar as the dining room. Being during work hours I could not enjoy items from the behind the bar, but the guys just down the bar from me were ordering and I was excited to learn the Stockyard has Moose Drool on tap. Instead, I had the diet Pepsi.  When the waitress asked if I was ready and I indicated not yet, I didn't realize that might be my only opportunity. I imagined she would only serve those at the bar; however, she also worked the room behind the bar and was constantly running back and forth. It took about 15-20 minutes, but eventually she returned to take my order. I went with the Grilled New York Strip Steak Sandwich. I don't know if the recession has caused a bread shortage, it is homage to Dr. Atkins or Webster has changed the definition of "sandwich", but typically I picture two pieces of bread surrounding the integral ingredient. Last week @ Robbie Fox's I was surprised that a sandwich came open faced. With the Stockyard menu providing a heading of "Sandwiches" and the brisket sandwich being called "Open Faced BBQ Beef Brisket", I foolishly assumed the other items not named "Open Faced" would have two pieces of bread. Not so. The sandwich arrived in about 10 minutes and was served on a single piece of bread with a side order of fries. Hmmm. That said, it was a regular sized steak - and for $15 a descent price. The steak itself was among the best I have ever tried. Tender, juicy and flavorful. The fries were crisp and tasty.   Although I am not a fan of Westerns, the bar had a nice feel. A copper cash register in the back corner with a picture of John Wayne to the waitress' attire and appearance screamed Old West. It had a nice feel. I don't blame the waitress for slow service because she was hustling the entire time. I think management needs to monitor customer flow and if it is busy on a Friday afternoon, there should be a server working that room and letting the bartender focus on  the bar and the libations.   The dinner menu escalates in price, but given what I had for lunch, the history and the atmosphere, I would like to come back and experience dinner in the dining room or maybe spend a quiet evening at the bar enjoying a Moose Drool or two.

Of all the businesses I was hoping the recession would put out of business, TicketMaster headed the list. I don't think I have ever felt passion in my life, but if I did it would be hating this company with a passion. The ticket prices are okay; I can live with that. What I hate are the fees. In looking to purchase tickets to an upcoming event, there is another $19.95 per ticket added to the price. Ordering 2 tickets, that's another $40 - the price of another ticket to a different event. The challenge is that while not technically a monopoly, they are close. There are options such as resellers StubHub, EBay and a local favorite of mine, Life & Leisure, but as far as ordering direct, often that isn't a possibility unless it is ordered through TicketMaster or direct from the box office. In the end it would cost as much in gas to drive from here to Jobbing.com or UOP Stadium as it would to pay their fees. A few years ago Pearl Jam tried to take them to court and look what happened to them - lost in an abyss of no-longer-relevants. Talk about stiff arm...

I didn't take in the full effect of this place, but I definitely would like to go back and do that. This was my first experience, and the first thing you notice is the amazing view. Being on a mountain, it provided great views of the city, over looked a golf course and was even nicer once the stars were out.  It definitely had the Old West feel. Walking to the entrance I smelled and noticed the large bull outside. Ahhh Smells like Ohio...at least the part of Ohio I used to hang out in...Going into the restaurant felt like a mine shaft. Wood all around, except for the large jagged rock jutting from the wall on the left and walking up a rather steep inclined ramp. When I emerged at the top, it was really cool. I felt like I was in Paint Your Wagon...the bartender was very cool and pointed out they have free happy hour buffet apps until 6. They had potato skins, veggies and a guy was in the process of changing out ribs for little chimis...He gave me a few ribs before taking them away.  Once my friend showed up, we grabbed a table that provided a good view. The drinks kept coming, and we ordered the appetizer sample that included somewhat rather skinny chicken wings, nachos, and fried mushrooms.   The downstairs had people in the steakhouse...and the steak smelled wonderful! Upstairs in the bar was basically just me and my friend. The waitress came around about every 5 minutes because she had nothing else to do. Not good to be that dead on a Friday night. She ended up getting to go home early because it was so quiet.  What would I do next time? Try the steak. As I said, it smelled great. Try the fried rattlesnake...never had it and I would rather bite one than have one bite me...try that big-ass slide that went from upstairs to downstairs...and after several drinks maybe join in the line dancing downstairs with the live band.   I had a good time here, but there were definitely more to be had. I will give it another go-round in the future.

Rachel Ray says if you see a restaurant with a line, it's a good sign the food is good. Restaurants know this too and I think often they create a false perception by making people wait. When a customer walks in, sees a full lobby, and is given a short wait the expectations are increased. When I arrived I noticed the parking lot was not that full. Multiple parking places up front and on each side. I walked in to see 5 people waiting; I gave my name (table for 1) and was told maybe 3 minutes. A couple of other people came in behind me and were added to the list. As I looked around between the row of tables on the right side of the restaurant, the main dining section, and the area on the left there were 8 empty tables I could see, plus half of the bar was empty. So what's with the wait? My 3 minutes turned into closer to 10.   The hostess sat me at a table and said the server would be right with me.  A few minutes later and he wasn't there yet, so she came back and took my drink order. She returned (still no server) and she asked if I was ready to order. I asked about the soup and she had to check (which is fine since she isn't a server and doesn't need to know what the soup of the day is currently). I ordered the soup and a salad - which normally would be the $6.99 lunch special, but only until 3pm. Finally the server showed up with the soup and he said he thought the salad was almost finished. It's a salad - the smallest one of the menu and shouldn't take that long. The soup and salad are also on the 13 minute lunch menu so it should be quick. He returned one other time with a refill on the drink  I finished the soup and salad, yet the server was not around. The empty plates and drink cups sat there for nearly 10 minutes. He when he came back I asked for the check and it was another wait. All in all it was an hour dining experience for a cup of soup and a small salad. As I left, the lobby was full with people waiting for a table - but once again there were several open tables.   It wasn't that busy, especially for a Saturday night, yet the lobby was full when there were plenty of seats available and the server was very slow.  The one redeeming factor was that it wasn't karaoke night. That usually is a horrible experience.

If you are coming to watch "the game", skip it. They have a few small tvs, but instead of having the sound on, they play a radio station. I went yesterday and it was a ghost town. The waitress was actually sitting at the bar eating bread and it appeared drinking a pint. After a while it was only us remaining. It was so quiet I almost forgot the game was on.

It's 4th of July and nothing says Independence Day better than a hamburger (also acceptable is a hot dog). What's better is a hamburger that I don't have to cook - so I stopped by Islands for some burger-goodness. The service was very fast. I ordered a drink and within seconds it was on the table. As the drink neared its end, another appeared promptly. The glass was never empty, which being someone who is constantly thirsty, is a good sign.   The burgers now come with the endless fries. I was there previously and the fries had to be ordered separately. I found the fries to be very good. A little crunchy, but not too crunchy. The burger was a good size. I cut it in half and could only finish one half. I went with the Hula - which is a cheeseburger with Swiss, tomato and mushrooms. The burger was a little messy. It had condiments on it and the combination of condiment and grease made for a messy burger. Most guys don't really mind messy food, and I am among that list. What I didn't like was the burger was extremely salty. I assume the mushrooms were sautéed probably in garlic salt - but I think there was a bit much. After a while, all I could taste was the salt. Good thing the drinks were endless...  I don't go often to Islands. Typically I think it is okay. The service is good, but I wasn't impressed with the salty, greasy Hula burger.

I like coming to Mimi's because it is owned by Bob Evans, which we do not have here in the desert. The food is traditional comfort food and always good. The highlight for me is the carrot raisin bread. I never order dessert because the bread could quality own its own as a dessert.  I ordered the meatloaf sandwich - it came sliced in half with a side of onion rings. I could only eat the one half. Nice portions. I noticed on the menu a drink called Pom Zero. That was new to me - pomegranate juice mixed with Sprite Zero. It could a nice spritzer - and I had about 6 of them.   The service was very good. Our waitress was always there to see if we wanted anything and the drinks kept flowing. At times I had half a glass and one in reserve. I also like the New Orleans deco and the feel of the restaurant. I didn't notice it on the menu this time, but in the past I ordered the grilled vegetable stack sandwich - that is incredible! If it's there, give it a shot!!

My family loves to come here. At least 2-3 times per month we come for the pupusas. There is  a combo plate that has 3 pupusas, rice, and beans for about $10, but typically I order two a la carte (just over $2 each). We usually get the chicharones, but the most recent time I ordered one chicken and one spinach. The pineapple aqua fresca is excellent as well. If you are looking for El Salvadorian food, this is the place to go.

Red Dragon is probably my favorite quick Chinese food in town. I first moved to Phoenix in November 2004 and lived in an apartment at Dobson & Warner. Red Dragon was a place my roommate and I discovered then and continued to use until we moved to another part of town in 2008. Luckily for me, I moved back to that part of town earlier this year. It is maybe a little pricier than other places - $11 for the General Tso chicken and fried rice, but it is worth it. I have never been disappointed and the portions are large enough that I usually split it in half.

Recently I decided to have a surprise birthday party for my girlfriend, and being that she and most of her friends are Mexican I wanted a place with good food. She is from Sonora, and the restaurant is described as Sonoran-style, so I put it at the top of my list.  I spoke to someone a few weeks prior who gave me additional information on private parties. They offer three different levels of menus for large parties. In selecting the Sonoran Celebration I picked two menu items and it came with rice, beans, a zucchini dish, and chips & salsa. Unlimited soda, tea, and coffee also come with that option. I had half of the patio overlooking the lake, booked it for 5pm with dinner served at 6.   I arrived a little early and had the opportunity put up decorations and set up the cakes I brought. While I was doing that two staff members were busy setting up the food line and brought me drinks. As the guests arrived they were offered drinks and chips & salsa while the food was being prepared.   The setting was perfect, my girlfriend surprised, and everyone reported having a good time. They enjoyed the food and as I booked for 35 but didn't have quite that many show up there were some leftovers that we brought home. It was a good choice (thanks to those Yelpers who provided suggestions on my Talk post), and I will definitely visit again.

I stopped by Flemings for a Saturday night dinner with a couple of friends. I had reservations, so even though it was busy, we were actually seated 15 prior to my reservation time. The atmosphere was as I expected, although I was a little surprised that some people dressed more casually than I would have expected.   The service was excellent. The waiter took our drink order and brought a loaf of bread that came with two spreads - both were excellent! One friend and I ordered the petite filet mignon, which was served with Fleming's potatoes. My other friend ordered the regular sized filet mignon with a baked potato. I have never seen a larger potato. My two friends each had a salad - one Caesar and house salad. The salads were each around $9, but good size. The regular filet mignon was $32, while the petite with the potatoes was $26. I didn't really think the regular size was that much larger than the petite.   The steak was phenomenal! I ordered it medium and I can't recall a better steak that I have ever had. It was cooked well, excellent flavor and the perfect size.  The server continued to fill our drinks, brought a second loaf of bread and made sure we had everything we needed.  The total of 3 diet drinks, 2 salads, a baked potato, 1 regular filet mignon and 2 petite filet mignons with the included Fleming potato was $135. Not bad for 3 people. I will definitely come back again.

I have lived right by this place for 6 months and never visited, so I checked it out for dinner. The farm part was closed in the evening, but the restaurant was open. Now, I have family in rural Ohio, so I know country life and what eating in the barn is all about and although this was enclosed, it was like a barn. I ordered the fried chicken and my friend the meatloaf. Both came with a scoop of mashed potatoes, a scoop of sweet potatoes and some zucchini. When I first saw the chicken I was like "one piece?!" (remember, I am fat)... As it turned out, it was boneless chicken and pretty darn good. I sampled the meatloaf and while it wasn't the best I have had, it was good. The coke I think was straight from the can. I ordered pie for dessert - my friend had peacan and I went for the apple, walnet, caramel. We asked to make it a la mode. It came out with a slice of pie and some soft-serve ice cream, but actually it was very good.   Another good aspect of the farm (although it didn't quite fit in with the barn atmosphere) was the live jazz singer and wine tasting going on just on the other side of the half wall. We could hear it, but didn't get over for the event. This weekend was the first in that series, so if you are up for some wine and light jazz, give it a shot. This was straight farm-to-table dinning and a nice atmosphere.

This restaurant is in a bit of a transition. Downstairs is a cafeteria style experience that has been the standard for the restaurant. Recently the restaurant received a liquor license and started full service upstairs. Our server was very friendly and described all of the proposed changes including closing up the upstairs, but making the roofing retractable so that it could be opened on nice days.   The views from upstairs were great - despite not much in the surrounding area to look at other than ran down buildings. At least the mountains provided a good view. The linens on the table and full service made it a wonderful experience. The food was good too - we started with the freshly made guacamole. It was just as good as Cafe Laredo, but half the price. I went with a margarita for $8, which really I could skip. I ordered frozen, but didn't get it and in general it was just kind of average. The chips were very good and the salsa very good. I ordered the beef taco with carne asada - which was surprisingly really spicy. I finished with dessert - the churros and the newly introduced sundae - neither were really impressive.   While the service was friendly and knowledgeable, the server was a bit slow. I am sure that will improve as they get more experience with the full service. The entree and the app was exceptional - skip the drink and dessert and it would be perfect. Overall it was just over $50, but subtract the $8 drink, the price for the churro and sundae and it would be a good meal at a good price.   While the bar isn't very high, this is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Queen Creek. I will be back frequently.

Misconception 1: if my great grandmother were still alive and liked to throw back 32oz draughts, this would be her hangout. Misconception 2: a margarita the size of an iPhone won't do anything to me, even if the "limit 3" is some sort of warning. Holy crap! Yes, based upon original scanning of the bar demographics I thought I stumbled upon Shady Pines happy hour, but eventually the crowd evened out and hey - those seniors were slamming the drinks. Me, on the other hand, was struggling with the Goldie-ritas. I deemed them small, but mighty. Not even the buffalo chicken foccacia could soak up enough alcohol to keep me from feeling tipsy. As I headed to my next event I pondered "how can I hang with the Golden Girls and be FUBARd by 5:30"?!

I gave Riazzi's a second chance this evening after a lengthy boycott. I was seeing a play at Gammage and the location made it a convenient choice for pre-theater dinner. My first experience with Riazzi's came as a team lunch about 3 years ago. The food was good, but when the waiter brought each person their check, he brought one of my co-workers two receipts. The co-worker looked them over and told the waiter he charged his card twice. The waiter said let me take care of that, tore one receipt in half and walked away, not fixing the problem. As the group left the restaurant he chased us down in the parking lot and said we didn't leave enough of a tip. I have not been back until tonight.  The restaurant is noticeable thanks to the large tree in the front yard. That tree as well as many others were decorated with lights for the holiday. Inside the restaurant was very festive and had a nice feel. Using my handy Yelp mobile application, I read some of the reviews and decided to order the Toretellini Riazzi with pesto cream sauce. My friend went with the stuffed eggplant.    The salad arrived first and it was an interesting blend. The first thing I noticed was the presence of beets. I have never had a beet, but it was there so I figured I might as well try it. It wasn't as bad as I expected - firmer and tasted like pickled dirt, but it was okay. The house dressing and the pepper made a good combination.   The entrees came out and my friend looked over her plate. The appearance of the dish was mostly that of the sauce and cheese. She offered a bite and I had to play Jacque Cousteau to actually find the eggplant. While she said it was good, she was not impressed with the swamp of sauce covering the dish and though flavorful, she admitted she would not order it again. The side fettuccini was good.  As for the tortellini, what can I say? Fabulous! It was very flavorful, huge portions and one of the best things I have had in some time. Unfortunately I was headed to the theater and didn't want the car to smell like pesto all night, so half of it had to go. No time for dessert.  The waiter was very pleasant, provided ample time to review the menu, answered questions and kept the drinks filled. Service was excellent this time, my dish was incredible and the menu large enough that I am sure my friend could find something more to her liking next time.  And the price - very nice. We both had water, but with both entrees, the included salad and her included side of fettuccini, it was just under $30.  Pretty good for a evening with a nice Italian dinner. I think my first experience with this place was a fluke and based on tonight, I would definitely give it another shot. My next play tickets are in 3 weeks, so I might be back then!

A very large selection of treats to choose from. I tried one of the newest flavors - the tamarind chocolate apple.$5 - incredible! Try one!

I am definitely a fan of Schlotzsky's - the odd, round shaped sourdough bread with a slight toasty crunch, with ham, salami, Genoa and a blend of 3 melted cheeses with onions, lettuce and tomato - it's the classic number 1 "original" - my favorite. I have been known to try the chipotle chicken, the Rueben and the BBQ Chicken pizza as well - you can't go wrong with a sammy or pizza from this place. Get the free VIP card and save 10%. The service at this location is typically good and they bring the food to the table quickly. Always crowded at lunch.   If you have a hankerin' for something sweet, they offer Cinnabon products as well. YUM!

I visited REI on my lunch hour to pick up a couple of outdoor flash lights. The store has a nice selection of about anything outdoorsy and from previous conversations with their store clerks, the employees are very knowledable. They offer clinics that some of my friends have taken advantage of and found them to be very informative.   Looking at the many available options of flashlight a clerk asked if I needed assistance and when I said no, she didn't bother me again. I like that.   The displeasure of the excusion occurred upon check out. The cashier was very friendly and asked if I was ready. She rang up my purchases and asked if I was a member of their co-op. I was not. She asked if anyone had explained it to me previously. Yes, but I don't shop here often. It is a one time fee and it covers you for life. That's okay, not interested. She continued to tell me that my purchase today would cover a good percentage of the fee. Still no. After the final dismissal, her attitude changed. She swiped my card and instead of handing it back to me, tossed it on the counter. She tossed the pen beside it. Very directly she asked if I needed a bag. Yes, please. She took the flashlights and dropped them into the bag individually and tossed the bag on the counter. Very nice. Lose the attitude, sister.

For opening night of the NFL season, I followed a meetup group to Buffalo Wild Wings.  The overall experience was mediocre at best. Parking was a challenge - at first I was excited to see available spots in front of the restaurant. Despite the yellow caution tape that appeared either a tree was falling or a crime had recently taken place, the car in front of me drove through and parked. I followed the lead, only to soon discover that those spots were roped off and we had to find another parking spot. Being a busy game night, all of the remaining spots were filled in the back, the sides and even around the defunct restaurant next door. Eventually I found a spot and made my way to the front door, where I discovered much like the parking lot, nothing was available. I made my way to the bar and wedged by way betwixt two apparent regulars.   The atmosphere was naturally very loud. A restaurant with several televisions, a packed house and music during the commercials made it difficult to communicate. Looking over the large selection of beers on tap, I was excited to see some of my favorites. One of the bartenders gave a rundown of the specials and mentioned that although other things were on sale, they just tapped the Oktoberfest keg. Sounds great! How much is that? $5.50, she said. Being that it was 5:30, I was expected some happy hour prices on something. Combined with the NFL opening night, I thought surely there is a deal to be had here. How about Kilt Lifter? When she said $6, I was surprised. Some of my favorite establishments offer that brew for $2.25 during happy hour and only $4.50 at off-times. Thanks, I'll go with a Miller LIte. Perhaps there was a special because my receipt showed the first Miller Lite was $3.50, and the next two were $4.00 each. Wouldn't it be nice if bars offered drinks in economies of scale? The more you drink, the cheaper it is? But I digress...  I ordered the buffalo wings, because really, how can you go to a place called Buffalo Wild Wings and not have the Wild Wings, from Buffalo? An order of 12 wings was $8.99. Seems a little high for a 5:30 time slot. I went with the hot - and they were hot (spicy and temperature) at first, but as the temperature cooled down, I didn't notice the spice portion being that hot. Unfortunately most of the wings were about the size of a McNugget. I barely found 1-2 that I would have considered normal size. If it were a fish, I'd throw it back.   Meeting a friend, I placed an order for the ribs & shrimp combo, which set us back $12.50 and while the portion was descent, it was less impressive than the McNugget wings. The fries were good, the popcorn shrimp small but tasty, and it even had some cole slaw - surprisingly the best part of the plate. The ribs were small and didn't have a lot of meat on them - which wasn't really a bad thing because what meat was there really had no flavor whatsoever. It wasn't even that hot either. Maybe warm, but closer to room temperature. Certainly not something I would repeaidly order t for $12.50.   All in all, the challenge to find parking and a side, the loud atmosphere which reminded me why I don't like many guys, and a tab of mediocre food & drink totaling more than $35.00 for a two-three hour extravaganza, left me thinking next time I will skip it and find somewhere that provided better food and prices.

This review may not accurately portray the resort because it involves a planned event/conference. We stayed here last year during the same period and it was excellent. The grounds are nice - a large, sprawling complex that can be a little confusing at night. Two nice pools, a life size chess site and spacious rooms are all very impressive. The catered meals were great last year and we were able to check into our rooms early. This year, not so much. Our meetings were finished at noon, but the rooms originally would not be ready until 4pm. Later it was changed to 2pm. Some reservations for our group were not made correctly and resulted in issues. When we called about our room the day before check in, there was a long delay in actually reaching someone. The evening of the first night I attempted to place a wakeup call, but no one answered. The food this year was weak. The first day breakfast was a small continental breakfast. Lunch was a house sandwich - slices of bread, deli meat, tomato and lettuce...I would have made that in my refrigerator at home. The swordfish and nice vegetables of last year were replaced with hors d vores this year. It felt like bar food at happy hour. I didn't stay for lunch the next day - it was a sacked lunch with what I heard was a wrap. Dinner was descent with made to order pasta stations, but really it was mostly just the pasta with very little side dishes. Housekeeping was unpredictable. Day 2 it was after 1:00 and they still hadn't been in our room, but Saturday they were knocking on the door at 8:05 am.   The internet access is $8 per day; the fitness center $15.There were hardly any items in the gift shop, which last year was full.  I know our total bill was high and compared to last year I had high expectations for another great weekend. The resort is in bankruptcy and being auctioned in the next few weeks. Comparing the stay this year to last year, it appeared they were cutting corners. I did not use the spa or the golf course to see how those services compared, but the services such as event planning and housekeeping were a come down from previous years.

My first experience with the Arizona Theater Company came last night at the OYE for [Title of Show]. The reviews proclaimed the show to be quirky, and it was indeed that. I was unfamiliar with the show, and even after a recent television commercial, I wasn't sure what to expect. The event also was my first experiencing with the Herberger Theater.   The theater and the show were excellent. I am a fan of the musicals, so I was interested in this event. The company put on an excellent performance and I enjoyed the show. I was kind of hoping for an intermission because the seats, although velvety-plush, were a little narrow. My knees were up against the seat in front of me and I could have used a stretch to bring the feeling back - but overall it was 90 solid minutes. Thanks to ATC & Gabi for organizing the event and the $9 discount tickets. I called the box office and although the flyer says "selected performances" I was surprised to discover that instead of 1 or 2 showings discounted in the middle of the week, the discount was good for about 80% of the performances. I am going again tomorrow with a friend and took fliers to coworkers.   I look forward to supporting ATC in future performances.

I recently attended a showing of Daddy Long Legs by the Arizona Theater Company. I was unfamiliar with book by Jean Webster or the prior movie adaptations, so I was uncertain what to expect. Robert Adelman Hancock and Megan McGinnis starred in the two-person performance about an early 20th century orphan and an unseen Robert benefactor sponsoring her through college. Although much of the interaction was confined to letter writing between the two characters, the story was engaging. The story turned to romance which caused my companion to say "awwww" and she reported being misty-eyed by the plays conclusion.  I enjoyed attending live theater performances and have now had two experiences with the Arizona Theater Company, both of which I highly enjoyed. The Herberger Theater Center is a remarkable location with ample-spaced seating and great acoustics. The seats I had were close and provided an intimate setting with the characters; however, there isn't a bad seat in the house. Supporting local performing arts is very important. The Arizona Theater Company is definitely a local treasure. I have seen Title of Show and now Daddy Long Legs - I will definitely keep an eye on the calendar for future shows.   Thanks to Jami from the Arizona Theater Company for making the event a wonderful experience.

I work for the same company as the first reviewer and this week it was my department's turn to volunteering at St. Mary's. This was actually my third time volunteering for the organization as it is an annual event for my team. In prior years I haven't been into volunteering because I was basically an ass and didn't see the benefit in it for me. Personally, the past six months have seen some really good highs as well as some very bad lows, but I met people who helped change my perspective on helping people and giving back to the community.  And even though it should be a year-round thought and not only be about this time of year, the need is more visible during the holidays. Knowing that people are struggling and seeing the good this organization does for people really does make a difference. With my family back East and just me here in Arizona I don't participate in the holidays, but spending time volunteering or supporting local charities is a great way to give to those who are in need and I have discovered the good feeling it brings.  The first reviewer provided good quantitative data on the number of hungry children and adults living in the country today. With 3 grandparents still living, I am sensitive to the needs of our seniors and the struggles they face with heating bills and medication taking money away from food expenditures. Another thing that impressed me with St. Mary's is that it was the country's first food bank, founded back in 1967.  A difference this year in comparison to my first experience with St. Mary's is the impact the economic downturn has had on families. Due to increased unemployment, cutbacks in jobs, rising bills and other concerns, many more people are facing hunger this year than ever before. That puts extra pressure on organizations such as St. Mary's to meet the demand, and that is accomplished in part to volunteers such as you and me. We were told that last year they served more than 65 million pounds of food - enough for 300,000 meals per day - do Arizonans alone. With unemployment continuing to increase, that number is sure to be higher this year. The volunteer staff member told us that the emergency bags they assemble, which is for people who just lost a job or are in immediate need and not yet in the system have seen an increase of 400% this year.  My group today totaled about 60 people and we filled boxes for 2 hours. When you volunteer, the cool thing is the volunteer staff member will total how much food the group assembled and how many people it helped. With our work today, she said we bagged 6800 lbs of potatoes, 2230 of the emergency food bags (which she said would be gone by this evening) and 15,200 lbs of prepared food boxes (550 boxes on 22 palettes). All total for the day, the grand total with prepared boxes and food bags, she said would be enough to feed 35,200 people. Granted we had a big group, but for just 2 hours of help, that is a big difference. The sad thing is with the number of people coming in for assistance, that food will be gone in a couple of days.  I would encourage everyone to take some time out of the schedule and help out. A little bit does go a long way and those recipients greatly appreciate what they receive.

Update: 05/01 For some reason it didn't give me an update button; only edit...so I am adding the new one above:   Another day and I continue to be dumbfounded by this location. In March I used to order the 6" breakfast sandwich and drink at the $3 combo price. That promo was not there in April in lieu of the buy one get one free special that this location never seemed to get correct.   Today is May and I ordered my standard 6" flatbread bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. As I progressed down the line I noticed the $3 combo sign was back up. In every other Subway location when checking out they ask if you want a combo, and if you say yes they push combo, and the register gives the combo price. After seeing the sign that says 6" sandwich and 21 oz drink $3, I removed a 21oz cup. The lady rang it up and said $5.50. I asked how do I get the combo? She said oh, you have to tell me that. Then frustrated she hit several buttons until it reflected the price. Shouldn't the combo be a standard item? All other times they ask if the customer wants a combo. If the combo is a sandwich and a medium drink and a customer orders and sandwich then takes a medium cup, shouldn't that be a clue? Either way, I think this location needs some additional training.     04/30/12: There seems to be confusion on the April promo of buy one get one free. It says get a free 6" sandwich when you buy any 6" sandwich before 9. My first attempt I ordered the sandwich and nothing was mentioned. I came back for lunch and asked how it worked. The lady said the customer has to tell them in the morning, they enter a code, and it prints on the receipt. No free one that day.   I went back again to the same location and upon ordering my breakfast sandwich I asked about the free one. She said I could get it now. I don't want it now. I want it at lunch. I don't want it sitting on my desk attracting germs nor do I want to re-heat it to kill said germs. After saying I didn't want it now, she said okay. It wasn't entered and actually I didn't even get a receipt :-/  The product line is the same as every Subway. The challenge is the shop is small with limited seating and fills up quickly at lunch.

I typically take my car back to the dealer for its regular oil changes and servicing, but this past time I took it to one of those quickie oil change places. When they were finished they told me my battery was almost dead and needed replaced. Having heard and ignored a similar message a couple of years ago I experienced being stranded for multiple hours and eventually purchased a battery at AutoZone. I bought the warranty at the time. I was surprised when the mechanic told me the battery was low because I just replaced it in September 2010 - big I did buy the car in June 2008 so to be safe I stopped at the AutoZone on Camelback.   I entered the store and asked if someone could check my battery. A gentleman grabbed the testing device and went outside to look. He tested the car and it registered fine. We started the car and still it was fine. He did say the alternator was running a big high, but it wasn't a problem yet. I told him that I was concerned because the oil change mechanic's report, my prior experience with being stranded, and I mentioned my blinder was spazzing out this morning. He checked the lights and determined a tail light wasn't working, I went inside and purchased the $5 part he told me, and he installed it. Instead of looking at a new battery and over $100 to replace, I left spending just $5.   He was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. The store was very busy and all of the employees were hustling to help customers. I really appreciated not only his honesty but his time to replace the product. Plus they had some sweet salsa music playing inside. I would definitely come back to this location.

I have eaten here twice and both times I have enjoyed the experience. I had the same thing - combo with tamale, taco, and tostada. The service was friendly, the food was good, and the service was fast. This is a small building next to the Chevron. It is nestled back just a bit from the street and easy to miss in an intersection with two other Mexican restaurants. If you want a small, authentic, and personal touch don't pass building by.

After returning from my half marathon in New Orleans I must have fallen asleep awkwardly on the plane. When I awoke I was sore and could barely walk. After attempting unsuccessfully to resolve the issue with a massage I called a chiropractor that I had been using near my apartment. Unfortunately they were booked for a few days and I wasn't sure I would make it that long. I found an alternative close to my office. I was able to get an appointment quickly and see the Dr.   She was excellent and examined me, took X-rays, and reviewed them with me. She performed an initial adjustment and I set up subsequent appointments. The first visit was a little more because of the X-Rays, but all other visits were $10. I was amazed at the $10 because the place I had been going was $40 for a visit. After a few sessions I was back to normal and running again.   I like that this place is close to my office, has an inexpensive office visit charge, and I am able to get in quickly if I need it. I definitely recommend this office.

My first impression is that Chas Roberts gives a mixed bag of service. I purchased a new home a year ago and have had many issues with the AC blowing too hard in one room, barely at all in another and some service issues with the downstairs unit. They have been to my house no less than 5 times in the year. The first guy to rebalance the air was clueless and a supervisor came out the second time to fix the issue. The downstairs unit stopped working early on in my home owning experience and the repairman indicated it was a bad coil. He serviced what he could and said he would be back when the part arrived. He installed it and the unit worked for several months. Two months ago it went out again and a service man came out - but when he showed up it was working and he didn't fix anything. My one year warranty ran out and the AC stopped working again.   The repairman that arrived today gave me a window of 3pm - 5 pm. He actually beat me to the house and I arrived at 3:03. He asked what the issue was; I explained it and he looked over the unit. 10 minutes later he came back and said I was finished. He indicated the problem was that the fan was not properly reinstalled when the coil was replaced months ago. Since he deemed it their fault, there was no charge for the service visit and repair. Many places would have charged at least the $65 for the service visit, but he did not. Very cool (literally!) in my book!

I had never had Bosnian food before, but I was waiting for CVS to fill my prescription and had an hour to kill, so I turned to my trusty Yelp mobile app to see what was in the area. Caffe Sarajevo was in the area and I was up for a new experience.  Once I located the resultant (not far from 35th & Northern intersection) I was a little skeptical judging from the outside of the restaurant. Don't let that hold you up - go inside. When I did I was surprised.  It was big and had an excellent décor. The server was very friendly and quickly brought out the Turkish coffee that I started with. I have never had Turkish coffee, but the reviews talked about it so I ordered it. The photo describing it as mud is accurate. It was very thick. The server said "this is the real stuff".  What to order at a restaurant where one is unfamiliar with any food from the region? Again, the prior reviews led the way. Each talked about the cevapci, so that's what I went with. Wow! It was great - it came with sour cream and a relish with excellent flavor.  A large helping of onions ensured I wouldn't be kissing passersby... The sandwich was large bread that was soft, warm, and flakey and loaded down with little sausages. It tasted like a gyro, which is to be expected since other reviews indicate it is beef & lamb. The server checked up on my a few times to make sure I was enjoying the meal.   This may have been my first experience, but it will not be my last. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area.

What a surprising evening this turned out to be - meeting up with a friend, we agreed to visit Sun Devil Liquors.  Waiting in the parking lot for my friend, my first thought was to get a lock-check on the doors. The area of town was old and a bit sketchy. Looking at the outside of the building I wondered if this is really where we were meeting. Somehow while I canvassed the immediate neighborhood, she arrived and went inside. A text informed me that she was waiting downstairs. Entering the building I looked around and it was a huge liquor store. More varieties of beer than I have seen and many liquors to choose from - but still, meeting someone at a liquor store?  I noticed the sign in the back of the store indicating wine cellar downstairs. First, any downstairs is rare in Arizona - so I proceeded toward the stairs. Descending into the area below, I was impressed. It had a nice selection of wines, a bar area and a weekly wine tasting (for just $5). My friend & I met and walked into another room where the wine tasting was being conducted. Just a small plate of cheese cubes & crackers, but five wines and a Champaign to enjoy. Not bad for the $5 price tag. The back room was a very comfortable space - couches, love seats, chairs were scattered throughout the room, art on the walls,  a man singing classic rock songs while playing a keyboard. This area definitely did not fit the first impression I had when pulling up to the store. The décor was nice - including a table that was said to be made from the Port collection from a recently deceased frequent customer. The tasting room also contained a small toy chest with a few games if you wanted to pass the time that way.  After the tasting was complete, we ventured back to the wine bar. We asked to try a couple of the various wine selections, and ultimately found one to our liking. There were also beers on tap to try. I don't remember the name of the first, but it said 3.1% and poured white and carbonated. My friend nailed it when she said it tasted like Froot Loops. I like names, so I had to try the beer called Yeti. It was an espresso roasted dark ale. The little sample I tried was surprising and I didn't particularly care for the first taste - but like the establishment itself, it grew on me, I ordered a full pint and enjoyed the evening.  Overall this was a great evening and wonderful find - surprising atmosphere in the downstairs, good beers & wines and a night of great conversation. I would definitely revisit Sun Devil Liquors again for a nice, relaxing night out.

Nice little dive bar on Dobson  & University.. Web site says they were the first  to introduce chicken wins to the East Valley - back in 1979. So I decided to order the hot wings. The verdict? These may be the best wings in tge valley. Ten for $7.95 and on Sunday they give a half order free?! WHAAAT?! With that, they are a better value, and definitely a better quality that other local "wing" establishments. Add 4 beers (beer of the month, Schlitz, Coors, and Miller High Life) for $21. Nice!

To be honest, I picked this bar because the sign looked cool, old, and I thought what a great dive bar. I stared off with Kamila from the Czech Republic and ended with Marc. By the end of the night I was in love. With Kamila I had large pitcher of Bud Amber and a vodka and water. The mixed drink came in a large glass - like a pint. The total for all was $11 and some change!  With Marc I was ordering anything he made me - and he made two at a time: apple jack, German Chocolate cake, and I can't remember the others. Anyway, I had five shots on the night, and as I said he made two of each. The price was $14. The bartenders know everyone that comes in. It has pool, darts, some games, the drinks are cheap, and the bartenders are cool as hell. When  I waked In I was thinking what the hell? Maybe one drink....but at the end of the night I thought I could be a regular.  The draft beer section is limited. Really just 4 on tap, a few more bottles - but come for the mixed drinks. You won't be disappointed! But eat before you get there because they don't have food (except for a $7 microwaved large pizza)

I went back, and I love it. No food, but nice beers and cheap drinks. I don;t even know that they keep a tab. I had 3 Miller Lites and an Old Style in a can. When I checked out the bartender said $7.50. Yes, please. Kind of weird that when I went in there were 5 customers, and they had football on but no sound. Then the Lady Gaga music started.

I dropped by Grazie Pizzeria & Wine bar to surprise my friend Ebony K. who was attending a wine tasting event put on by the AZWinebats. It was my first experience with Grazie & the Winebats. Thankfully the recent rains had stopped and it made for a pleasant afternoon that could be enjoyed on the patio or inside with the doors open. I loved the interior and décor.   The event was $20 and provided tastings of 8 wines and samples of food. The food consisted of three different types of Bruschetta, two types of salad and about five various types of pizzas. If you left hungry, it was your own fault. The food kept coming! I had the Bruschetta Salsiccia which was loaded with Melted Provolone covering sausage & fennel. I didn't try the Caesar salad, but the Emiliana was excellent. The pizzas were thin crust, and the first was a little soggy. It was a pepperoni pizza and most of the toppings  were slid off - but it was good. A second piece was better. I am not sure all of the varieties, but I do know Vegetariana was one that I remember.  The wine presented a nice sampling. The best for me was the first one, which also happened to be the cheapest - the Orvieto Amabile from Bigi. It was a sweet, white wine.  I liked the Sangiovese Riserva from Umbeito Cesari, a red; and Rosso di Podernovo from Castello Delle Regine. The one most people seemed to not like the most was the most expensive - a champagne Brut Rose' from Hello Kitty.   The owner and the staff were extremely nice and explained each wine selection, they held a raffle for a few prizes and kept the food coming. The atmosphere of the restaurant was excellent. One thing that was distracting was the restaurant seemed to retain sound well and the place was loud, even with the doors open. Sometimes it was a little difficult to hear.  As for the food, the wine, the event and the company - excellent all the way around!

One giant YUM! While venturing out for lunch I stopped by See's because really, who doesn't love chocolate? The allure of free samples speaks to me! Holy moley! The truffles are magnificent! If I lived anywhere other than the hot desert of Phoenix and assuming I had someone to share truffles with, I would have picked up several. But alas, I settled for two...however the experience was great and I will definitely be back to gather more bait for women...what's the shelf life on a truffle??

Awesome atmosphere and a unique place to go. I ordered the habanero burger and it really lit me up. As I was nearly finished the waiter remembered it is supposed to come with a free glass of milk (which I didn't get).

I really have no need for water or ice, but after my second trip to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles in as many days (I ain't scurred), what better way to further reach the upper echelons of any Weight Watcher Point System than to finish lunch hour off with some ice cream? A welcoming sign in the window of the neighboring Water n Ice store proved to offer the opportunity.  My friend and I entered the rather small store to peruse the selections.  She ordered a scoop of mint chocolate chip and a scoop of chocolate malted ice cream on a sugar cone. The ice cream was $2.95 and the cone 30 cents extra. We noted a sign indicated credit cards accepted for orders $10 or more. I stepped up and ordered the same. Our third companion refrained from placing an order, but the store owner offered a second sign reading a charge of 95 cents would apply for charges under $10. He stated that is what the bank would charge him and he didn't want to pass that on to customers, but you gotta do what you gotta do.   One of us commented on the unique shape of the scoop. Rather than the traditional ice cream scoop that produces a round ball of ice cream, this was an interesting pistol type scoop and release contraption that dropped a square cylindrical pellet like scoop. The owner asked if we were familiar with Thrifty ice cream. We were not. He described how Thrifty was a drug store, big after World War II - but one of the things that most attracted customers to the store was the ice cream. The chain has since sold off to Rite Aid, but the ice cream has continued through some Rite Aid locations in Southern California and various other places such as this Water n Ice franchise.  The mint chocolate chip was very good - one of my favorite types of ice cream. The chocolate was a little odd. The chocolate portion was smooth and creamy, but the little pellets of malt (I assume whoopers) were just a little odd. The crowning moment of the experience occurred when I handed my friend the cone while I backed out of the parking spot, buckled up and entered the road. Unfortunately, each exit was a one way street the opposite direction of where I wanted to be - so I took one and had to U-Turn on a side street. Back in the correct direction my friend suggested I better get to licking. A lick or two into it and both scoops flopped off the cone and onto my shirt and pants. Fortunately, I was wearing brown pants and a green shirt. Unfortunately, my cone consisted of chocolate on the bottom and mint on top (the exact opposite of my friend's cone) - so the green ice cream ended up on the brown pants and the brown ice cream on the green shirt. I guess it was so good I decided to save some for later and wear it home. Lesson learned: don't lick and drive.  Overall the store and the ice cream were both good experiences. Kudos to the owner for enlightening me/us on the history of Thrifty ice cream. I will probably be back, but next time maybe I better eat it before driving.

I have limited knowledge of the works of Frank Lloyd Wright other than Falling Waters and the Westcott House in Springfield OH (close to my home town of Yellow Springs). My Mom is in town and her friend is a fan of FLW, so I took her to Taliesin West and embarked on the tour. This was my first experience on the tour. A large portion of it is outdoors - so it is best not to do it in the summer months. The bottle of water given does not last long given the conditions. The tour is $32 for a 90 minute tour through the grounds and some of the buildings. My tour today was actually longer than that. The tour guide, Don, gave an excellent presentation and was very knowledgeable. He provided a lot of detail and answered questions.  The gift shop is nice; maybe a little pricey, but it is Scottsdale. Going in the winter would definitely make it a 5 star event, but July/August makes it tough to completely enjoy and pay attention. If you can catch it in the late evening or fall/winter - it would be a must  do!

This is definitely a local brewery that is among the best in not only the state, but a contender in the region. Kiltlifter is one of my all-time favorites, but the Raj IPA is a close second. Also at the top is the Peach ale, and of course in the Fall Pumpkin Porter is one of the best pumpkin beers in the country.   While the beer is put the brewery on the map, the food cannot be missed. Add some blackened chicken to the nachos, get the southwestern egg rolls, or go with the classic fish & chips and you will go away fat & happy. This time I tried something new and went with carne adovada con huevos. I wasn't sure what to expect, but wow! I was impressed and glad I tried something new.   The building is big enough for everyone. Room on the patio, room around the bar, and inside, but the one challenging feature is parking. Behind the brewery is very limited. Street parking fills up quickly, and parking in the apartments across the street will earn you a very quick tow.  Go for the beer, but don't skip the food.

Woah, Nellie! Is there anything better than Oregano's? The parking situation could be improved and the place gets crowded fast (a sign of a good establishment) , so try to get there right at 11:00 when they open if you are planning a lunch. Dinner time? Fuggedaboutit!  You will have a wait...  The pizza is always a good option. The slices are huge and one will typically fill up even a big guy like me. Maybe add a small salad if you must. I also enjoy the Big Rig Pasta. Lately I have been trying to be less of a big guy and instead, have ordered the salad. I have never attempted a full size and typically can only come close to finishing the half portion. The Pablo Picaso Mexican Salad is good, as is Mrs. Gibbilini's Original Spinach Salad - but my favorite is the Vino Bambino.  Hint - don't eat it all! Save room for dessert because there are fewer things on Earth I have experienced that are better than the Original Pizza Cookie. YUMMY! It's best not to be in a hurry because the cookie takes about 15 minutes to prepare - but its well worth the wait!

Loved it! Tucked away next to Tops Liquor is a little pizza place serving up piping hot slices of heaven. The pepperoni pizza was hot, cheesy, and tasty. Combine that with a side of hot wings covered amply with sauce and my friend &I had an excellent lunch. This was the perfect pizza! I'm glad she introduced me to Tessio's! For $10 we each had a slice of pizza and we shared the wings. Take that, Rachael Ray.  Seating is limited inside - just two tables. Most people appear to pick up or have it delivered. Either way, it was excellent.

I had lunch here with a coworker. I ordered the Humdinger, really just because I wanted to say it. It was underwhelmingly average...Nothing really stood out for me. It was busy, the service was average and the thick bread sandwich was similar to Schlotzsky's.  I could go again or I could skip it. It was just okay for me, dog.

Pub Crawl, stop 2: I have been to The Library a couple of times and like it. What's not to like about college girls dressed in school girl outfits, sometimes live music and beer? The flyer stated it was offering $5 lemonade drinks and Absolute raspberry. This was apparently news to the bartender, the waitress and the manager. Good thing I had the flyer (which they then kept). The bartender said they had to do something to adjust the price in the computer and it would be just a minute. The Absolute raspberry was actually a rather big shot and was tasty. I asked for a Bud Light while waiting for my change - the bartender suggested Bud because it was $2. I took the Bud. Another guy ordered a Bud Light and the bartender again suggested Bud. The guy asked how much Bud Light was and was told $3.50, where Bud was $2. The guy decided to stick with Bud Light and was surprised to see his receipt...he said I thought they were $3.50? The bartender said "They are $4 actually..." The guy left pissed. Meanwhile this whole event was about 20 minutes and I still don't have my change. Finally I received change (after drinking the shot and half the beer). I left $1 and moved to the back of the bar where I ordered a second beer for $2.   While I like the Library in general, the negative experience with the bartender including the confusion on the drink price, the long wait for change and the incorrect price for the guy beside me deflated my opinion of this bar a little.

I like going to the Gammage. When I first moved to town, it was just okay. I lived in Atlanta and the Fox Theater is definitely better - but what Gammage has Fox doesn't is parking. It is typically easy to get in and out of Gammage and the parking is free.  Show tickets are usually easy to come by if you get them early and if you buy season tickets there is a season preview to introduce the shows to you.  I was fortunate to get tickets to see Wicked for the final performance last night. A lucky break and our seats were in row 2. Wicked was phenomenal (definitely 5 stars!) and the seats were so good my friend said she had goose bumps from the performance (especially Defy Gravity).  The air conditioning was on and felt good. The staff is typically friendly, but something the popular shows do get crowded and the ushers have been known to get a little stingy with the Playbill. I saw Rent early this season and the usher only gave one Playbill for both my friend and I to share. Usually the main lobby has a desk with more if you get there early. I have never ordered a drink or snack there, but they looked a little pricey.  The advance ticket show window is conveniently located right in the main door.  I have been to shows in New York, Washington DC and Atlanta and 8-10 shows at Gammage.  It isn't the best, but Gammage is a pretty good theater for Phoenix.

Nice, tucked away location that reminded me of my hometown in Ohio. I didn't know exactly how it worked, but a guy at the restaurant explained it to me. I went with the potato soup of the day and the curry crab pasta. I loved both! The pasta was creamy with a nice hint of curry. The portion they gave me was huge and I barely finished it, but seeing the sign above the complimentary chips and salsa asking not to waste, I felt compelled to finish it off...I also ordered the strawberry honey lemonade - incredible! I stumbled onto this place by accident, but I will be back.

I stopped in for a slice recently and was reminded how much I enjoy this. I used to work closer to Tempe and frequented this location regularly. A slice or two always hit the spot. Now I work further away and rarely get back here. Another huge boost with me is they deliver to World of Beer, which I am frequently in attendance. It is just across the street, but that extra service is well worth it! They have a wide variety of pizzas, and all of them are good. This is a great fast, cheap option in Tempe.

Recently I saw that my big boss, Dr. Love checked in to Caffe Boa for a brunch. In speaking to him, the menu sounded wonderful and I thought it might be a good pre-theater dinner experience; Saturday was my opportunity. I was greeted promptly and taken inside, although I think the outside dining would provide a great environment in the early spring. The décor was beautiful - exposed brick, French doors, artwork, nice draperies leading into the back room. The table setting was nice with a rope tied napkin containing a sprig of rosemary. The waiter, Chadwick, arrived quickly to take the drink order and returned with the trio of hummus, pest and olive oil w/ balsamic. Living next to Queen Creek Olive Mill and having a pantry (unused) stocked full of QC Olive Oil, that wasn't as impressive as someone unfamiliar with the product - but I liked the support for the local merchant. Chadwick explained the background of the products on the menu and how everything is organic and locally supported. Nice touch. The manager stopped by later to explain the rosemary is a sign of hospitality in Croatia, from where the owners descend.   We started with a salad - the Caesar and Fall Panzanella. My friend thought the Caesar was flavorless, but yet indicated it was good. My salad had many flavors going on - Balsamic mushrooms, lettuce, bread, goat cheese and a layer of puréed butternut squash. Delightful! Moving to the second course, my friend had the Agnolotti - a forest mushroom ravioli in tomato crème sauce, which she claimed was excellent. I went with the Autumn Maccaroncello, which just sounded good - Butternut Squash and Wild Honey Sauce, Toasted Pepitas, Pecorino, Slovenian Pumpkin oil topped off with Sonoma Duck Confit. I'll be honest, I didn't know what half of that stuff was. The  maccaroncello was one of the somewhat thick and longer than I expected. My palette is not as developed as my friend Joel L., but if he said it was missing the Slovenian pumpkin oil, it probably was. I couldn't tell Slovenian pumpkin oil from Crisco oil - but I agree that it was sweet. So sweet in fact, that I couldn't eat it all. That didn't stop me from ordering a sweet dessert...I ordered the chocolate cake with the raspberry, the chocolate ganache - I don't know the price of it, but it was worth it, whatever it was!  The salads were each $9-$10, which at first sounded high, but the portions were big and anymore Paradise is about $10 for a salad - and this was much better. The Agnolotti was $16 and my Maccaroncello was $20 with the duck. A couple of sodas, the cake and it was $75 for the meal. I ended up tipping too much, but $10 would be cheap, and $15 didn't feel right. Giving $20 would be $95 and that was just odd too, so I went with $25 and made it a nice round Benjamin. The service by Chadwick was excellent and the manager stopped by two or three times, so it was worth the tip. I would definitely come back here any time and sample something else from the menu.

I stopped by Thai Basil with a coworker for lunch and was fortunate enough to find a parking spot. The restaurant is very small and the tables are close together, but it is always packed - which is a sign of how good it is. We both ordered the pad thai with chicken, medium spice - and even that was fairly spicy. Pad Thai is not the most adventurous meals, but it is still one of my favorites. A side of Thai tea and I was very happy.   The service was good and the food arrived quickly. Two orders of Pad Thai chicken, one Thai Tea and a water = $17.29. Get there early to get a parking spot!

My first experience with Casey Moore's was a team lunch this afternoon - a team of about 20 people. The restaurant was large enough to accomodate everyone and the staff was very helpful in assembling tables and chairs. Ther service was prompt and the food surprisingly quick given our size.   I thought of trying the oyster po-boy that was a lunch special, but in the end I went with one of my favorites - fish and chips. I have had countless fish and chips and restaurants and bars throughout the US and UK. This was right up there near the top of the list. The breading wasn't heavy; the fish light and flakey. I found the cole slaw with the green and red cabbage and carrots was exceptionally good. It was not saucy or too rich. The flavor of the vegetables stood out with just enough sauce to provide flavor. Yum! The portion was so big that I barely touched the fries. You will most likely come away with a doggie bag from this place.  I would definitely go back - maybe try some oysters or try out the bar.

I visited Jobing.com for the Kiss concert earlier this week. I previously visited a few years ago when the Dancing with the Stars tour came to town. The arena is very clean, I found parking to be a breeze and the staff great. Some coworkers told me to expect $20 for parking. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was no charge. My friend and I arrived early and had time to go to the Yardhouse close by. Having neighboring food and drink establishments close by helps save money on the inside.   My seats to the show were on the floor and ushers showed us the way. Although the tickets said no camera allowed, fans had cameras and cell phones. Security allowed people to walk to the stage with their camera, while the band members walked over and posed while playing. As long as fans stayed for only a couple of minutes and were orderly, security approved. The seats were good, the atmosphere great and it was maybe the best show I have ever seen.  I found getting out of the arena was good. Police guided the way, directed traffic with a descent flow and it was a quick drive to the highway. Great night and an enjoyable venue!

Meeting up with friends for lunch, we stopped at Mon Ami Gabi Restaurant as it was close to another stop we were making. The other 4 were already there (coming from the Venetian) and I was on foot coming way down from the Luxor. Needless to say, I was holding up the crowd. The rest of the party could not be seated or put their name on the list until I arrived as well. When I finally did arrive, we were seated outside on the patio - which was a plus. Nice weather, good views - but the table was very small. Too small to crowd 5 people around. Inevitably, there was frequent bumping from people walking by on their way to and from their tables.   I thought the service was a bit lower than expected. One guy came out to give everyone water. He filled up everyone's glass and when it came to mine there was only enough for 1/3 of a glass. Did he get more? No. So I drank it thinking it would be a sign to bring more - but it wasn't. We did receive two sleeves of baguettes. One saucer was filled with the olive oil for dinner and there were four other saucers for people to put their bread - except there were five of us. I had to eventually stop someone and ask for a plate.   Looking over the menu I selected the Caesar salad. When everyone's plate was brought out everything looked so good. Another guy at our table ordered another kind of salad and it was huge - then mine came out. It was one of the smallest, most boring things I have seen ever: a few strips of lettuce, some cheese and a shard of bread - all for the nice price of $9.   I could definitely do without a repeat visit here.

Looking for some pasta prior to the Las Vegas marathon one of my friends selected this restaurant located in New York New York. We were staying at Luxor, so the walk was close. Thinking ahead, she made reservations well in advance - and that was a welcome decision as we entered to discover the line around the corner. No issues for us - we gave our names to the hostess and were seated in less than 5 minutes.  The server greeted us and took provided water immediately upon seating. She returned with a basket of bread and butter soon afterwards. My friends each ordered a glass of wine and we shared an order of Calamaretti Fritti. For an entree one ordered Conchiglie al Pollo, the other Pennoni alla Vodka, and I the Barilotti alla Valtellina. Mine came in a bowl filled with whole wheat pasta, cabbage, potatoes, string beans, portobello mushrooms, Fontina and Grana Padano cheese, butter and sage. It was very good, but also very large. I ate about half of it and was finished. The price was good for that dish at 15.99. The other two dishes were $18.59 and 16.99, respectively.   All restaurants on the strip fill up quickly - especially on a weekend that featured the Las Vegas marathon, a bullriding championships and a country music award show - make reservations! The food was delicious and our service was very good. I would definitely be back.

A place with over 300 reviews, a favorite of many people on Yelp and I finally make my first visit? I know, right? I need to get out more. I have wanted to go to Fez for a while to see what all the fuss is about, but had not yet made the effort. To be honest, I stumbled onto it quite by accident. Arriving at Urban Yoga more than 2 hours prior to my massage appointment, I needed to kill some time, so I turned to my handy Yelp mobile application. When I saw Fez was only a few blocks away, I had to walk down and give it a try.  I wasn't sure what to expect. With all of the positive things said about Fez, would it live up to the hype? Maybe it was an urban legend? I remember Ebony K. and Gabi M. talking about sweet potato fries, so I knew I had to try those! Walking in, it was early and not that busy. The bar was about 3/4 full, but the dining area was mostly empty. One thing I read in many Yelp and food critic reviews was the bold marriage of flavors of the food. The first indication was the table itself - a bold orange table with stark white plates and white linen napkins.   Looking over the drink menu I ordered a Sam Adams Cherry Wheat Ale. This is a good beer with a subtle cherry flavor. I tried on previously in the Atlanta airport at Sam Adams and commented it was good, but at $7.50 was a bit too high - Fez had it for $3. Yeah, baby!   The menu was packed with many good sounding choices, but going to yoga soon I brought shouldn't have anything too heavy - my Yelp app indicated there was an April customer appreciation special: tomato basil bisque with grilled cheese on Texas toast for $6.50. Yes, please. And of course the cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries. When it arrived I the server presented it with a side of apricot aolie sauce...I couldn't tell you what apricot aolie sauce was going in, and if it were something to order on the menu I would have passed it over, but I am so glad it came with the fries. It was incredible and had an excellent flavor. Definitely worth the $4.95 for the basket - and I could only finish half.   All in all, my bill was $17 - for a beer, the fries, soup and sandwich. When the check arrived I felt like the guy on the Staples commercial "THAT'S A LOW PRICE!" I was definitely pleased with my first (and won't be my last) experience with Fez.

I am still a sushi novice and remain in the calm waters of the California roll and salmon rolls - occasionally Philadelphia and Las Vegas....meeting up with Ebony K. she attempted to move me a little more off the wall. I went as far as the rainbow roll and looked at her Unagi Roll...not going that far yet. She is a sushi fan and far more adventurous than I am - she might try a Kraken if they could catch it and put it in a nice hand cut roll - and if it's happy hour, then it's on!  We sat in the back and it was nice and quiet at first, but soon on a Saturday night the place was packed. I will recommend the drinks - she had a pomegranate martini, which was good - but my watermelon martini was phenomenal!   The service was good, the sushi was fresh, and the atmosphere was excellent. Getting a table wasn't bad - 5pm on Saturday night and we walked right in - later in the evening there was a wait. Parking in that part of Scottsdale is always a challenge. It might be best to just pay the $5 valet and let them worry about finding the spot.

I stopped in for lunch during the work week. It is located not too far from my employer; however, I had never visited previously. Having lived in Atlanta for 12 years I enjoy barbecue, but have not found too many places in Phoenix that it well. My initial experience with Bobby Q was via catering at a work function. It was very good, especially for catered food and I added it to my mental list of places to try, but continually forgot to actually go. A few work friends were having a happy hour get-together and again I passed it up. Finally I went for lunch and was suddenly said that I have missed prior opportunities to go.   I sat at a table in the bar area and the service was good. I had the sweet tea, which is a requisite for any good barbecue meal. The menu had several good looking items, but I went with the pulled chicken sandwich and a side of mac & cheese. The sandwich was excellent and I would put it right at the top of the Phoenix barbecue list. While the sandwich was great, the mac & cheese was phenomenal and I would rate it as the second best I have ever tried. I envisioned myself as David Blaine shackled into a phone booth filled with this mac & cheese and I had to eat my way out to survive. I win that battle my friend. I win that battle 9 times out of 10. And the doughnut things on the way out? Yes, please!  I will most definitely be back. I may go with the chicken again or try another tasty item from the menu, but whatever I get it will come with a side of mac & cheese.

This was my first experience with Indian food. As a side note, I would recommend that you don't try something completely new for the first time by yourself. That's what I did - so I was the single guy in the corner looking at everyone watching what they took from the buffet, how they ate it, etc. They thought I was weird. The restaurant itself was nice - good parking right up front. I got there right at noon and it wasn't busy. The hostess was very friendly and the staff prompt and friendly. As for the food, I can't really tell you what I had, but it was good. I had a  soup, and tried a little of each of the dishes on the buffet. They brought out something and sat on the table. It was a crispy thing with something inside. I watched for others to eat theirs and joined in. It was pretty good.  I would definitely go back, but hopefully with someone that knows something about the food.

I am not much of a reader, but I used to work at a bookstore and I buy a lot of books...creates the allusion of being a reader. But more importantly, I like attending events and getting books signed. I have unfortunately missed Neil Gaiman  and Ozzy Osbourne over the years (that would be cool), but I have attended to meet Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons of Kiss, Britney Griner of the Phoenix Mercury, and most recently Anne Rice. I have already purchased by ticket for Cary Elwes this week.  I like the store, not only because of the frequent and big-name book signings, but it is a convenient location to my house, has a great selection, and a little attached eating area. I subscribe to their Facebook page and continue to monitor their newsletter for other upcoming signings. I definitely recommend supporting this store and meeting some of the many authors that come through the doors. Parking is a big challenging, especially during book signings.

This was my first experience with Phoenicia and I was very impressed. I ordered the mixed Kafta with a side of rice. I have never been a big fan of hummus, but the employee asked if I wanted to do half rice and half hummus for $1.50. I said yes - and it was very good! A little garlicky - which matched the garlic sauce brought out with the plate. If you plan on doing any kissing either avoid that sauce or make sure your date has some as well - it was very strong (but good).  The plate with the added hummus and water was $13. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place and the staff was friendly and efficient. I will definitely be back!

A friend of mine and I visited this restaurant over the weekend. We had a different original perception of what it was, never having actually had a pasty before. I ordered the reuben pasty and it was good. The meat had a good flavor, some sauerkraut and the thousand island was brought on the side. The meal was a good size and left me satisfied - although I kept thinking about Sweeny Todd while eating the lunch.  The one downside I found with the restaurant is that we arrived near opening and even though we were the only two in the restaurant, the music was so loud that we could barely hear each other talk. Otherwise, it was a pleasant accidental finding.

Since I moved to Arizona late in 2004 I have lived on the eastside of town and frequently been to Mill Avenue. I have walked past this theater countless times, but had not previously stopped. It is a little surprising because Mill Avenue reminds me of my small hometown in Ohio and we had a small art theater too. Last week I purchased tickets for my fiancée and I to see a movie there, and was pleasantly surprised. There is the old-style ticket booth out front, but I was also able to pre-purchase tickets online and pay via PayPal. There was a snack stand right through the entrance where all of the traditional movie-goer fare was available. Inside, the theater itself was large with plenty of seating. With this special showing the director was there afterwards to hold a Q & A session - which I thought was really cool. The one challenge is after the movie finished there was music playing which was a little loud to hear the director fully. Otherwise, it was a wonderful evening in a nice venue that took me back to what a good movie experience used to be like. I will definitely see other shows there and support the independent movie scene.

They just remodeled,  and it sucks.  The AC doesn't work yet so waiting in the lobby is unbearable now that it's hot outside. They combined the box office and the automated box office line,  then mixed in a lane to go through when you already have tickets.  Except its confusing so people are standing in the wrong line.  The whole benefit of using the ABO is to save time.  Now its part of the line for customers to do,  and many have no clue what they are doing.  So plan extra time to get your ticket because the lines are now long filled with people who don't know how to use technology and people in the wrong lane.  You'll need a good 12-15 minutes now to get your ticket.  Assuming you dont pass out from the lack of AC while waiting in the line.  Renovation created a horrible traffic flow.  I won't be coming back here

I have to admit I went for the name. It looked like a dive and did include a small disco ball and a Rockola juke box, but the place was charming. I ordered the wings and a Beagle Beer. When my friends and I arrived, it was early and not very crowded, but soon there were several people. Many of them were women AND they were late 20's - late 30's like me. Usually happy hour finds me wading amongst college kids, but this was more my speed. The service was good, but a little slow because there was only one person working at the time.  I would definitely go back - some specials on the menu including Beagle Beer for $1 from 10-12pm on Saturday and Tuesday. YUM! Come and knock on my door!

It is summertime in Phoenix and that means the mercury is rising - not only outside, but on the basketball court too! I had never been to a WNBA game before, but I took advantage of a Guys Night Out package where tickets to the game were discounted. Lower level seats normally $45 were $25 - and that included one free drink and a pass to the Man Up Zone. From previous reviews, it is clear that I hate TicketMaster - but even with their ridiculous fees, it was $32. The drink included wine, beer or soda - so that savings basically covers the TicketMaster fees.   Arriving at US Airways Arena, I found the seats easy to locate. The arena wasn't too packed - only about 50% full I would estimate - but even though it was not full, the crowd was really into the game and the decimal meter reflected the excitement. The Mercury were taking on Candace Parker and the LA Sparks - these two clubs fought back and forth with the energy and game-changing drama of a Suns vs. Lakers game. The Hip Hop Dance Team put on a show during time outs and half time that pumped the crowd even further. The video scoreboard announced it was time for Fourth Quarter and the crowd went wild. A back and forth match with Phoenix's Diana Taurasi scoring 20 on the night, and even though LA's Candace Parker had 26 points and 12 rebounds, the game came down to a defensive stop at the buzzer and a 1 point Mercury win! Mighty, Mighty Mercury, indeed!  It was nice to see after the game that the entire team stood on the court while DeWanna Bonner addressed the announcer's questions and thanked the fans for coming out and supporting the team. A few minutes later two players arrived at a table in the concourse for a post game autograph signing. Another thing that was great to see was the excitement from the kids. A train congo line allowed people to dance around the court during a time out. Looking around the arena I saw older women smiling and getting into the game probably wishing the WNBA existed when they were young girls - and there were the teens and younger girls who were into the game looking up to these ladies as role models. Inspirational for all ages!  What a fun time! Cheap tickets, a chance to see a quality team (2007 & 2009 WNBA champs), and conveniently located on the light rail. I would like to see more fans get behind the team - these women play with energy and excitement, leaving it all on the court and they are the defending champs. Since being formed in 1997 they have two championship rings. Since being formed in 1968, the Suns have zero. Come out, grab some great seats and support a winner.

Irish Pubs are one of my favorite things. I met a friend for drinks at a nearby bar a couple of weeks ago. He said he wanted to check the Skeptical Chymist on the way out because a couple of night prior he went to Rubio's and the parking lot was full with people going to the pub. Our visit early Sunday afternoon and it was nearly empty.   Walking in, I was pleased to see how spacious it is. Lots of room inside plus patio seating. We sat at a high-top table - a large beer barrel with a thick wooden top. I absolutely love the table. It is the perfect height. I learned on my next visit the wood comes from the Washington/Canadian border and is screen printed there. Most of these read Guinness.   A good selection of beer on tap - and none of it is Bud Light, Miller Lite, Corona. Of course they have Guinness. I started with a Newcastle and later discovered the Firestone Walker Velvet Merlin. Wednesday evenings are another good night. It was busier than Sunday. The special during happy hour is half off appetizers and flatbreads and $2 off all pints. I wanted to try some new things yesterday, although I started off with the Velvet Merlin. I tried the Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA, a Wider Brothers Marionberry hibiscus gose, a Deschutes black butte porte, and a Grimbergen Dubbel all draught pints. Add an order of cod sliders (4) and I got out of there on $22.  The server was very friendly and stopped by frequently to see how we were doing. She split the check up between the two of us without issue and the orders were accurate.   I like the feel of this place, the specials, and the large selection of beers. Right now this is my favorite spot, even though it is far from where I live.

A friend purchased tickets for me to see a show at the Hale Center Theater. I had not previously been to or even by the theater and didn't know what to expect. It was very small, and in entering the building I was skeptical . I though perhaps the play would be just one set, but I was incorrect. The aisles were wide enough to allow the cast to change out the sets. The small size of the theater provided a cozy atmosphere and made every seat in the house good.   I would definitely go back to this theater any time. It provides a close venue to see local theater without the traffic downtown Phoenix.

I really like Harkins Theaters. I was a big fan of Regal when I lived in Atlanta, sometimes went to AMC, but here in Arizona Harkins is my choice. In comparing it to other options, the ticket prices are around the same. What really sells it for me is the t-shirt & cup loyalty program. This year the cup is the same $4.95 price, but the shirt is a little more than last year. Still, if you are a regular movie watcher it is well worth it. I typically go every weekend so it pays for itself quickly. With the loyalty program the cup can be refilled for $1 and bringing the shirt (you don't even have to wear it) gets you a free medium popcorn. If you are with someone, upgrade it for $1. My friend and I usually go to the movies together. We each have a cup and we have 1 shirt. For $3 we walk away with 1 large popcorn and 2 drinks. When traveling to New England last fall and going to the movies we were reminded that not all movie chains are created equal especially when the concession prices for a large popcorn and drinks were $15!   My typical Harkins has been San Tan, but occasionally I liked to go to this Superstition off of Power Road. The advantage is at San Tan there is mall traffic to deal with. I usually go early so getting in isn't a problem, but getting out is a different story. At Superstition you don't have to contend with that - easy in, easy out. The lobby is big and usually has several lanes of concessions open to speed customers through the process. Now that I moved to Gilbert Road, this location is closer for me anyway, so it will be my new regular. Plus there are many restaurants nearby to make it a full night of dinner (or lunch) and a movie.

Thanks to my friend Erin for showing me this place. Tucked away in an industrial park, I was finally impressed with a BBQ place in AZ.  The place fills up quickly, so she recommended we get there around 11 or after 12:30. On the first and third Wednesday there is a buffet - but this was not that Wednesday.   Looking at the menu I ordered by name and chose the Big Butt. It was a huge pulled pork sandwhich and I couldn't finish it. I ate the pork, but left the bun and some of the fries. I found it to be tender and juicy. It has some sauce, but I sprinkled a little of the molasses on top and it was the best I have had so far in Phoenix. I would definitely come back to this place.

Being that I was on a Light Rail pub crawl, I had to take advantage of the light rail...I walked down from Mill Avenue to the Light Rail and boarded the train to Priest & Washington. My friend has written about odd folks on the light rail, and this was no exception. On the way back from the bar I sat too far from where the train would stop. After it finally stopped, I began walking toward it and realizing it was further away than I expected, I started jogging (and drunk jogging is not impressive). Still, as I drew closer the chimes sounded and the door started to close before I made it - then an arm came through stopping the door and I was able to board. It was an older guy who appeared to be in the same condition I was in - or worse. A few young college students were behind me and starring at him in amazement as he started talking to me. He asked me if I was from here. Queen Creek I said. Oh, you are from here? Well, really from Ohio. He said but from Earth? He told me that he mostly recently came from Albuquerque and he was trying to get back on this train. He talked to me about time travel and how his relatives came from St. Louis on a wagon and it took 6 months. Isn't an airplane a form of time travel? You can make the same journey in 3 hours. How is that possible? I did keep up the conversation with him because he really into his tale and would agree to any BS I threw out there. I said telephones might be the next time travel machine and this light rail was a form of time travel also. He talked about Einstein and Relativity... As we reached the Mill exit he said he was trying to ride the train back to Albuquerque and maybe if he stayed on it he would find his way back....good luck with that - but thanks for holding the door for me!

I recently stopped to shop for a yet to be revealed large purchase. It was about 7:30 on a Friday night and the building seemed closed - but it was open until 9. When I entered I was greeted by an employee who was very helpful. As I continued to shop I received input from the rep, another employee, one of the jewelers, and even a fellow customer. They were all very helpful, showed me many options, calculated the financial breakdown. I ordered my product and received it a few days later. It was a very easy experience with a friendly, knowledgeable staff.

I know the name on the building says it is known for pizza, but the burgers are some of the best in town. When I lived in Chandler, I used to visit here more often. One time I visited in the evening and I don't remember what I ordered or what the issue was, but I was not happy and complained. The waitress had the manager come out and he offered to cook up a cheeseburger at no charge for my friend and I. We agreed, and to our surprise, it was incredible! Since that visit, I have exclusively ordered a burger.  There is a regular Boston's burger for $8.19 and a bacon cheeseburger for about 80 cents more...if you order the regular burger and add cheese, that's 50 cents - so might as well just get the bacon cheese burger. The fries are excellent also with a nice seasoning.  One thing that worries me about this place is that the past two times I have visited, there have not been many customers. I went today for lunch - 1:30 on a Saturday and I was the only customer. There was one waiter and when we asked if that was normal, he did say it is hit or miss. Two weeks ago he said it was busy and they had 3 servers, but last week they had to send 2 of them home because from 1-4 there were no customers.   I would expect that happy hour is busier. Tonight he indicated they were putting two large projection televisions outside to show the Suns game 6 and afterwards, UFC 114. That might draw a crowd.  I have not tried the pizza because now that I have had the burger I can't move on past it. It is a good burger and approximately the same price (perhaps even a buck cheaper) than what you would get at Red Robin.  Give Boston's a shot if you haven't lately.

I stopped by this location for lunch with a couple of co-workers on Thursday. We each ordered the two slice lunch special and drink for $4.00. I would have liked to see a pizza and wing lunch combo like another pizza establishment down the road.   Both of the people in my group went back to the counter because the pizza was cold. The staff was very friendly and provided a new slice recently from the oven.  The pizza itself was just okay for me. I like the thicker crust and the taste was fine, but really it didn't stand out to me anymore than a Digiorno.

Port of Subs is the same as most other sandwich shops - except how do they get pickles so thin? Seriously - they are thin and translucent. The staff is fairly skimpy with the toppings and my sandwich maker today was not proficient with the avocado scooper. The scooper is very small. He put one scoop that was about the size of a quarter on the sandwich. He attempted a second scoop, which he had to scrape around the bucket, and then fumbled the exchange as he tried to put it on the sandwich. As both dabs of avocado hit the table, he reached for the spatula. The spatula was not much better as he dropped it, and attempted to schmear the little avocado on the bread. As much remained on the handle as was on the bread. Maybe he's new? Or maybe they are just skimpy on toppings and have an inefficient staff?

An overall lackluster experience. The chips, salsa and beans were good - however there were three of us studly men there for lunch and the chips didn't last long. The empty basket remained for a while, but eventually was refilled.   I went with the spinach enchilada lunch special with rice & beans. It was average. The waitress was cute and that was a plus, but she was also slow. It took a little long to get the food, too long to refill the chips and too long for the check.   I would definitely avoid a special trip to come here, but if I were at the Arizona Mills and wanted to eat somewhere that wasn't the food court and not the Rainforest Cafe, I guess it would be this place...

I give Wendy's a higher star because there are no Wendy's in the QC, so I have to drive to find one - and Wendy's was my grandmother's favorite burger joint, so I do like it too.   I approached the counter and placed my order with the cashier while images of Ryan C.'s advice on picking up fast food workers for wild passionate times ran through my head. But I refocused and ordered from the dollar menu. A burger, small fries and a medium frosty completed my order.   I have to add the Wendy's Frosty to my list of happy finishes because really, is there anything better, at least at a fast food restaurant than a Frosty? not counting Ryan C.'s comments, that is....but I digress...the cashier asked me 'what flavor?" - Excuse me? There is only one true flavor of Frosty and that is the original chocolate Frosty. The others are like inbred cousins. Although I am Vanilla Heat, I do not want a vanilla Frosty. I do not want some odd swirl, something with toffee chips or weak attempts at impersonating a Blizzard. Give me the chocolate Frosty...and yes, I do want fries with that. I had not really tried it, but I was thinking of a conversation with my friend a few months ago where she indicating she liked dipping fries in her Frosty. I was daring and gave it a shot. Yes, ladies - I am hip, spontaneous and daring. Call me...to my surprise, it was not bad. I am sure I will stick my fry into the Frosty again in the future. Thanks to my friend for the suggestion...

Tour de Light Rail Pub Crawl, stop 1: I began the Tour de Light Rail pub crawl at this spot. I have been here before and had some good times, so I felt good starting here. I arrived, met the guy at the table and exchanged my $20 for the requisite t-shirt.  The bar was offering $3 domestic beers and $2 pirate rum drinks. I started with a pirate rum & coke. The bartender made a very good drink and the shirt allowed me to get up to the front of the line. The club started filling up, mostly in the back; up front was sparse and the front patio was empty. After 3 rum & cokes and a beer I decided it wouldn't be much of a crawl if I stayed in one spot. Plus the Tavern specials were all night long, where other places had specific hours. Time to move on to another location and take advantage of the deals.   Later in the night, I wrapped up my Light Rail journey by coming back to the Tavern and having another domestic beer. The bar was packed then - the back room, the front room, back patio and front patio.

This is my favorite spot for a smoothie fix. A couple of years ago while working on a marketing audit paper for school, I learned of Inta Juice by watching ESPN. Randy Moss, wide receiver of the New England Patriots is a VP of marketing. He contacted the headquarters to set up locations in his home state of West Virginia and ended up purchasing a few locations. They asked him to be involved with marketing and he said okay.  This location is the only one in all of Arizona, but I was fortunate that it was close by while living in Chandler. Any time I drive down Arizona Avenue (like today) I stop and have a drink. The service is prompt, the store clean and the products fresh.   Business-wise, they have a great model and test each product in their two main locations in Colorado before releasing to the public. You will find consistencies between various locations - which is a plus when traveling.   They have a nice variety of smoothies and juices to choose from. I like the acai smoothie, the trail mixer, the choco-nutter, love potion # 9 and my favorite, the Intense Energy made with Red Bull. They also have wheat grass shots, vegetable juice blends and green tea products. If you want a smoothie give Inta Juice a try!

It's funny - I wrote a review about another location of this restaurant and wasn't too impressed, but now I come a couple times a week. I usually get the lunch special of two tacos, beans, and rice. It comes with a drink and is a good price. They have the bar with various sauces and fixin's. I like the green and the brown salsas the most. I have had the chicken enchiladas, the potato, and the nachos (not the small nachos, the pachos). All are good. The tacos and enchiladas come plain and you dress them up yourself on the bar.   Pick up the free chips at the counter. This is one of my two most regular lunch time establishments. If you go at lunch around 12:30 it has been known to be packed. I try to get there at 12 and there are a few people in line, but not as bad.

I recently experience a mild case of identity theft. Not too bad - the companies involved stopped the charges or refunded the money that had already been taken. But I did cancel my debit card and visit my nearby branch. I entered with two out of state checking accounts, a recent large deposit, and a barely used checking account. The various tellers have been asking me for 8 years if I wanted to change to an Arizona account, but I was too lazy.  I was helped this afternoon by the senior personal banker, Monica L. She was incredible. Very personable, patient, and helpful. She explained everything, made recommendations, and helped me put my accounts in the best position to work for me. I came away with an Arizona checking account and a money market account. The two out of state accounts will be transitioned out once the fraud charges have been restored.   She made a challenging situation more manageable and I came away with a better line of services than I entered with. I have been a BOA customer for 8 years, but rarely use their services other than online. After my experience today I will definitely be more open to other services and using a personal banker like Monica for guidance.

So time has not been as positive for my experiences. I require very little attention. I have direct deposit, I don't come if often, and I do not need much assistance. After my 2012 activity the changes were positive. Over the years I have dwindled the money saved and the once free account manifested with a $25 per month service charge. After more than two years of paying the fees I finally went in to close that account. The lady was very helpful in closing the account for me and transferring information to my other checking account. Before leaving I suggested I needed to order checks for my account because the closed account used to be my primary checking. She said she already did that. Well more than eight weeks later and I still have no checks, and when I attempt to order them they are $21? The other thing that is annoying is the main reason I went in was to save the service fees. She did close the account that cost me $25 per month, but what she failed to mention was the changes to my savings account created a $12 per month service charge to be added there - so really I am only saving half of what I thought. I really need to be convinced there is a purpose to using banking accounts. They offer no interest or useful services when you lend them money, yet if they loan the customer money they charge service fees and expensive interest rates as if they are doing a big favor. I would rather keep my money at home in a jar.

I recently stopped here for an eye exam and new glasses per the recommendation of a coworker (he said Target, not this one specifically). This location was close to my home and has hours until 8pm. The doctor I had was extremely friendsly and performed the eye exam well. He was honest in what my choices were and what it meant for the future.   I ordered two pair of classes and was told to expect 7-14 business days. My visit was on a Wednesday and I was surprised when they called me the following Tuesday to say they arrived. The fit was good and the price reasonable. Not only was the doctor friendly and knowledgable, but the staff was also. With hours until 8pm I will definitely come back here in the future.

What an excellent facility this was! I had never been to the symphony or the opera until receiving Yelp tickets to see Faust. The building was larger than I expected, yet easy to navigate. I didn't feel herded like I do trying to move around Gammage. The lights and decor were wonderful and multiple areas to purchase drinks made it easier. Also the availability of restrooms made it much easier than Gammage. We were in the back section of the lower seating and the sound was wonderful. The play was in French, but a nice display provided subtitles so that we could follow along. I would definitely go back to see either the symphony or another opera. It was a great evening out! Parking was also convenient in a nearby parking deck ($12).

A friend introduced me to the Iron Chef Japan show a few months ago and that caused me to notice this restaurant while shopping at Basha's one morning. The logo on the menu shows a chef in similar stance as the show.  This restaurant is in a great location on Power & Chandler Heights right in with Basha's & behind Burger King.   The restaurant is very small, as Gregory L. described in his review. One thing that has changed since his review is that now there are 4 booths and 1 small wooden table for 2. While he advised carry out would be a better option, I found the dining room to be nice. I visited at noon on New Year's day and the restaurant was empty. Several people arrived for carry out orders, which tells me the place is popular. The booths were good sized and the wall had photographs of customers enjoying their meal. It gave the restaurant a nice, homey feel. The staff was very friendly and the meal was prepared in about 15 minutes. Plus the soda machine had Orange Slice - I haven't seen that since like 1988!  I ordered the General Tso, which is what I order at every Chinese place, but it does serve as a good benchmark for comparison. The dish was among the best I have had. The chicken was lightly crisp and the sauce had a good flavor, but did not drown the plate. You can choose between white or brown rice, and it is loaded with vegetables. Onions, carrots, peas and pork were very prevalent in the fried rice. Another surprise was the egg roll - I have not tasted its equal. It was definitely not frozen like other restaurants use. It wasn't hard and dry, but fresh, handmade and loaded with cabbage.  The menu is extensive. I took one home for future considerations. Given my first experience here and the size of the menu, I will be back and trying other dishes.

I met someone here for a date and it provided an excellent atmosphere. The building was very spacious including outdoor seating, a couch area and plenty of tables & seats. It made it very easy to talk and get to know each other.   My date indicated she didn't like hot beverages here as much as Starbucks - sometimes they are too sweet...instead we both went with an ice blended beverage, which closely remembled a frappachino at Starbucks. I went with the black forest which had chocolate, cherry and bits of expresso. I also saw other customers working on computers and meeting with groups. Definitely a cool spot to meet people or catch up on some work.

A friend of mine absolutely loves this place and convinced me to go with her. She said her favorite item is the Macedonia.  She said everything is good and recommended what we will have on our next visit. The Macedonia was very good - sweet and fruity. When I was little my great grandmother used to make me what she called a barnyard soda - which is a Pepsi float with vanilla ice cream. This reminded me of that, but all fruit instead of soda. I had the strawberry ice cream scoop, she had vanilla. The drink was a mixture of mango, strawberry, pineapple and came with a spoon and a straw.   When we arrived there were three ladies at a table, but after we arrived the place was busy. Several people stayed, but others picked up and took out. It was constantly busy during our stay. Each Macedonia was $4.95 and well worth it. It was large and I wasn't sure I could = but I carried on and we each finished ours.   I felt very comfortable there and we stayed talking and enjoying our drink for over 2 hours. I will definitely come back and try more of the drinks since this is just two streets down from my apartment.

I typically drive past this place every day coming and going from work. I decided to stop in and give it a try. The restaurant was not very busy when I arrived, which was nice because the menu was large. I decided to try the chimichunga - and am I glad I did!  I went with the carne asada and it comes topped with lettuce and a bit of guacamole, a side of beans with cheese, and rice.  The rice was moist and flavorful. I was impressed. The beans were fairly standard beans. When I made it to the chimichunga, woah Nellie. I think it was the best tortilla I have ever had. It almost tasted like a waffle fry at the fair (but no powdered sugar). It was not huge, but it was very filling. It was so tasty I ate the entire thing. I will definitely be back for more!

I love Uncle Bear's. This is where I go for happy hour. Either this location or the one on Rittenhouse in Queen Creek. Good happy hour prices on drinks and sliders. I love the hot dogs and usually order that because a) they are very good b) big and filling and c) $7. The wings are $8.50 and sometimes a little too skinny, but other times good. I have not had anything meal-wise that is bad. The desert - I ordered the ice cream cookie sundae and really it is best to skip that. Other restaurants have it is a mini pizza pan, it comes out hot and gooey. This came out in a bowl, was the thinest layer of cookie that cold still be molecularly called a cookie and there were three huge scoops of ice cream that never melted because the bowl wasn't hot and there wasn't enough cookie to retain heat.

I had lunch with a large group during the week (Wednesday). The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice. Outside dining with a nice court yard and patio was pleasant (some pigeons, but not many today). I ordered the rose infused lemonade, which was a bit tart, but good. I had the days special frittata which came with avacado, tomato and asperagus as well as a side of apples. The food was good and the feel of the restaurant was good. On the weekends during brunch I imagine it would be overcrowded and not enough seating. The properly is of good size and could probably expand the seating more to accomodate the larger weekend crowds, but during the week it is comfortable. I would go back.

I like this little club. It appears to be a small club in a strip mall next to the Horse & Hound, but inside it is very spacious. The club brings in a good mix of local artists and larger known performers. I saw KRS-One here in 2009 and Slick Rick here yesterday. Security is smooth - I typically pre-purchase my tickets and have no trouble getting in the building quickly. Both times I have been the show was pushed back an hour, but once it started it was great. It gives the local acts a chance to get their name out there.   Yesterday I didn't purchase alcohol (I pre-limed elsewhere), but I bought an energy drink. Actually I bought two because there is a $10 limit on charge cards and the drink was $4. A couple of bartenders there to keep it moving.   The sound is good, but the thing I like most is that while it is overall very roomy, it is also a venue where you can get up close to the performers.  I would recommend seeing a show here. Most are about $20 and tickets are easily purchased online. They have a web site, but the videos and photos show they are not always updated. I think if they had an improved web site that included recent pics, videos and upcoming schedule, it would be great. There is a calendar of events, but it could be improved.

I love an Irish pub, and I love me some Fibber Magee's. My trips are fewer now that I live out in East Hell (Queen Creek), but when I lived in Chandler @ Dobson & Warner, I visited much more often. I still love the feel of this place - the dark wood, the high round tables. I feel like I am back in Dublin.  I used to get the bangers & mash every time I visited, but the past few times my most recent time I went with fish & chips - one of my favorites. I didn't see the bangers on the menu this time, so it may have been changed. The full Irish Breakfast is exactly like I had back at the Tyrrellspass Castle Restaurant on my way to Galway, Ireland.  Wash it down with a Guinness or a Black & Tan. Sláinte!

Definitely a dive - nice wood paneling on the walls...I went for the PBR Tiki Lounge, and the function was great on the outside - although when I arrived there were no bands on stage. Inside the bar I ordered a can of PBR since it was a PBR tiki lounge. It took a while for the bartender to check up and give me a second one. She didn't say how much it was, but I threw down $4 and she took it all. Another thing to note is that it is cash only - no tabs. They do have an ATM in the back. Admission was $3 for the function.  There were no bands inside and the place didn't have much traffic in the afternoon, despite the function starting at 2 PM. Eventually I wandered outside and saw a band, but there were not many people outside either.  There were some interesting people...I was drunk thanks to the Oktoberfest I came from earlier in the day, but there was a Ghost Buster and a banana behind me...I had 3 PBRs and called it a a day. Overall this bar wasn't too memorable for me...

This bar really has two distinct personalities. There is the original bar which has a few taps, but mostly bottles & cans. It is more of a traditional dive bar and has the major label beers (plus some of the forgotten brews that are more nostalgic now such as Hamm's & PBR). I was impressed that I checked in and received a Yelp coupon for 50% off of my first drink. I had a tall Red Stripe, a Hamm's, and a PBR for a grand total of $6.   Next door, or through the door in inside the bar, is a second version of the bar. This has a whole different feel. It is more of a craft beer, newer bar. Unlike the chalk board menu next door, this section of the bar has electronic menus with a good assortment of micro-brews. Each of the ones I had on this side were $6 each.   A huge highlight for me was the menu. I ordered a Sonoran hot dog for $3.95. Being engaged to a lady from Sonora I have had several from various places. The Sonoran hot dog here was probably the best I have ever had. And it was cheap!   I like this place because it does have two different personalities and depending on your mood, one of them will be right for you. I like the newer side with a good selection of draughts and bottles. Not to mention the hot dog!

I saw Big Sticks listed here on Yelp and noticed it while visiting the Bass Pro Shop and again going to Toby Keith's. I am not a cigar smoker and know nothing about what to look for, but I wanted to go and pick up a couple as an introduction.  When I went to Toby Keith's on Saturday, the store closed at 8, and I missed it at 8:30. They may have changed their hours - the prior review indicated closed on Monday, but they were open today at 3:30. The store was cool - a pool table up front, some nice leather chairs and new 50" plasma TV delivered as I was shopping.   I entered the store room not really knowing that I was looking for - I think the guy working was the owner. He came in and asked what I was looking for and when I said I didn't know, he offered some tips. He showed me various selections, gave me some ideas for beginners and told me to ask any questions. One the way out I picked up Cigar Aficionado magazine, which just came out today. He picked up last month's copy and gave it to me for free since it was my first time.   To someone new, the selection was overwhelming. The storeroom was filled with all prices and qualities. A lot to look at! I ended up taking the two the owner suggested as well as one of the Robb Report winners.   I would definitely love to go and just hang out some evening. Smoke a cigar in one of the oversized, comfy leather chairs. Wanna join me?

Not really feeling the clientele. People at the bar are quiet and cool but others in the restaurant are dipshits. I also didn't feel much from the server.

I have been here twice recently and I think this is my new go-to place. There are other sports bar/happy hour places close by, but they are definitely in a league to themselves, and not in a good way. Unlike the d-bag & biker crowd just a block away, Fox and Hound Pub has a friendly crowd with a great staff. I reviewed the new sports bar down the road and remarked how slow the service was there - Fox and the Hound has an attentive staff that has never left me waiting.   I have had the Ranch hand burger and it was excellent. The nachos were something else I have tried - amazing! They have a large selection of beer on tap and craft beers (both domestic and import) that will please any beer drinker.   The last two times I have visited I have sat at the bar and had Stefani. She is very friendly, attentive, and good to talk to. I have not been disappointed with the service or the selection here. A definite happy hour must stop.

Yesterday my group at work had a team building lunch followed by a competitive round of games. We were a group of about 20 with prior reservations and they had a separate room awaiting our arrival. There was one main waitress who was assisted by a couple of others when the food was served.  If I didn't look around at my dining companions, I wouldn't have felt like I was in a large group. The drinks were brought out quickly and promptly filled. When the food was brought out, the orders were correct, the temperature was excellent and it didn't take long to serve everyone.   I had the blackened chicken pasta and it was a good sized portion, good flavor and an all around descent meal for the price.  I would definitely order it again.  While we were eating the store manager came out and gave us a background on the company's history, the business model, how it has adjusted to the recession and described the length of time and number of staff it requires to open a new location. The newer models are smaller and require less time and resources to open - 45 days and a new store can be ready to go. This location is approximately 53,000 sq feet, while there are smaller ones around 15,000 sq feet.   After lunch, we broke up into teams and played 5 different games in a head to head format. Everyone had a good time and enjoyed not only the dining, but the gaming experience. I have been to the location in Atlanta and this was just as fun.  It was an excellent team builder and gave me the opportunity to check out this location. Bravo to the bosses for picking this place.

I use Parking Spot everytime I go to the airport - I used to use them all the time when I lived in Atlanta and was glad to see them here in Phoenix, but I may have to change. At nearly $11 per day now they are one if the most expensive, yet always one of the slowest. I typically see 3 buses of everyone else roll by before a parking spot bus moseys along. Each time I've had to call to see if a bus was en route. Not efficient for the price.

The fair is kind of cool because it always takes me back to being a kid. Not specially this fair since I am from Ohio, but the generalized idea of "the fair". The Arizona State fair typically has at least a few descent concerts that I added each year, a lot of rides (which I do not ride), and a lot of games. But there are also a lot of challenges, and perhaps it is partially because of the age of the fair and the growth of the neighborhood around it. First, parking is challenging. Actually not so much the parking, because I usually have no problem parking on the lot for $10, but getting to the parking is the issue. The traffic is very congested there and it makes getting to the fair a negative experience. There are throngs of people crossing the street which delay the turning cars, and they in turn block the street so the cars diving toward the fair cannot proceed.   Another issue is ticketing. It is the 21st century and you would think there would have been some advances in ticketing. But no. Come on a Friday evening and be prepared to wait a long time to get a ticket because there are hundreds of people and only six ticket booths. How about installing some automated ticket booths like the movie theaters?   I like the concerts, but I am always confused. Do I pay for the concert AND the fair? Typically that is what I have been doing, but last week as I was hoping to go to a concert and the long ticket line caused me to not get through until 7:15 there were fair representatives telling people if they had their concert ticket they could just go in the back gate without buying fair admission. I also heard that there are free general admission seats to the concerts if you have a fair ticket. I attempted that this Friday and unfortunately did not get in because the general admission was already full.  Traffic issues are not limited to the street. Friday evening walking down one of the main paths in the fair everything came to a standstill. The path had food booths on both sides so people standing in line at those vendors extended into the path, and there were so many people coming in both directions that it turned into a mass area of people just standing and unable to move for more than five minutes. As we were able to slowly eventually shuffle it moved better once we passed the food booths.   I still like the thought of the fair, even though it is an expensive evening with the food and games. But the parking, the ticketing, and the number of people in an area that is too narrow makes it an experience I can only tolerate once or maybe twice per year. The fair cannot address the issues of the street traffic, but adding improved ticketing and spreading out the items inside the fairgrounds would help.

In my continued effort to find good barbeque in the desert I stopped by Lucille's for lunch. There were a good number of customers, but it was not overcrowded. The restaurant had several employees working as well. The ribs sounded very good, as did the chicken. I thought I would go with the rib & chicken combo, then I noticed the Carolina baked potato & salad combo. That stood out for me because in Atlanta I used to go regularly to Champs BBQ and always ordered the Hickory Baked Potato. The description on Lucille's menu was similar, so I made my selection.  The waiter brought out complimentary buttermilk rolls and cinnamon butter. Okay, he said complimentary rolls, but it was a singular roll. It was a little hard, but edible. Tasted like something you would get from the KFC drive thru. It took several minutes for the waiter to bring my diet coke and I never received a refill while I was there.  The meal arrived and the first thing I noticed was the salad. It took me back to 1975 when I good salad included iceberg lettuce and cherry tomatoes. Yep, that's what it was...plus some carrot shavings and croutons. After seeing the purple cabbage, I believe it was the prepackaged salad in a bag from the grocery...inspired by 1975. The ranch dressing continued the time warp. It was very runny - I think from being the final remnants of the original bottle of dressing and they added water to extend the number of servings. Very blah and plain.  Another interesting item on the plate was the small watermelon wedge. WTF?   The baked potato definitely was not Champs. It was dry, which okay I get that I can pick my sauce for the topping. I chose the dark BBQ sauce. It was good - sweet and molassessy (is that a word?). I took the pulled pork version of the potato and it included sour cream, cheese, scallions and was just okay for me. I ate it, but I will continue my search for a good local BBQ place.  Another thing I wouldn't recommend is going there if you are on a typical work lunch. As I mentioned it wasn't overcrowded and there was staff on hand, but the service was slow. The coke took a while, when the food was brought out he asked if it looked okay and I didn't see him again until I was finished and impatiently waiting on the check (several minutes after being finished...)  The price for the potato was $9.75 - probably a touch too high for what you receive. There wasn't that much meat on the potato. The coke was also $2.95 - so maybe water would be a better choice.   Slow service, slightly higher price and just average potato (below average salad) makes this place just okay for me. I tried it, but I would prefer to go elsewhere.

More than a year ago I wrote a review about Lucille's and I wasn't impressed. This weekend I made my first re-visit since writing that review. This time it was Friday night with Ebony K., her friend, and her friend's parents. The restaurant was accommodating to changing the original reservation from 3 to 5, and we were seated quickly.  Overall the food was excellent - you can read about it in Ebony's review, but I will say my chicken was excellent. As a side I ordered the sweet mashed potatoes (which everyone ordered). As a tip it is mashed sweet potatoes and not some type of sweet mashed potatoes. Also I went with the cheesy grits - and they were that. The chicken was moist and had a great flavor. Everything about the food and the atmosphere was excellent and much improved from my first visit (but I still didn't eat the watermelon slice)....  One thing that was a little below the food was the service. While the staff was very friendly, they did appear to be a bit slow. We asked for vinegar and for hot sauce; we asked for hot water for coffee; we asked for diet coke after the tea was weak. Each of these requests had to be repeated twice.   I have to say, I was more impressed - the atmosphere, the company, the food was all excellent. A little less with the multiple repeat requests and it will be excellent. And thanks to Ebony K. for getting me to give Lucille's a second chance.

Third time is a charm...one bad review and one good review. With a friend in town, we decided to go for BBQ. I have been to Lucille's a couple of times. The last time was descent so it seemed like a good option. Tie-breaker indicates the first review (negative) may be the more accurate. Again the food was good (but my friend wasn't happy with the gravy slathered all over the chicken. The issues with slow and incorrect service remained.  It took a while to get drinks, refills were slow and incorrect. Several people came in after us and left before us. Dessert was so slow we had to cancel it. They must make each cobbler from scratch as ordered because 15 minutes later we still had no pie. An additional displeasure is the restaurant is very loud - especially on the patio. It is hard to hear others at the same table due to the noise. Two hours for a Friday lunch for three is a bit ridiculous!

You know I love beer, and this is an excellent local brewery. I have had every beer they offer, and they do a good job with not only the standard offerings on the menu, but the seasonal beers as well. The good is also great. My most recent drip included a nitro Friend of the Devil beer with a small Asian Pork pizza. I ate the whole damn thing!!   Parking can be challenging, especially on the weekends. It may take a short walk from a nearby side street. The large outside patio is a great place to hang out al fresco, but there is plenty of space inside. Great spot to meet up with friends, hang out with good food & beer, then take a growler to go.

I was looking to take my Mom to a nice Mexican restaurant while she was visiting Phoenix; more specifically the Queen Creek/Gilbert metroplex. She is from nowhere-Kentucky and gets Mexican dining in small buildings where the taco/enchilada combo plate is the house specialty. We were planning on seeing a movie afterwards, so I ventured to San Tan Village and visited Cantina Laredo.   The restaurant had a nice decor and atmosphere. The seating was nice (but I think they found the smallest table for us). The waiter I think was also the bartender, but it was slow at noon on Sunday, so he waited tabled. I think his name was Stuart. Very nice guy. The chips and salsa arrived and I dug in. Three bowls of salsa - two red and typical salsa (very good) and one warm that didn't really blow my skirt up. I passed on that and ordered the table-made guacamole. It is just under $10 for the guacamole, but it was very good and well worth it. Stuart used three full avocados in making the dip. I ordered the Puerto Vallarta, which was a combination platter with two enchiladas and a rolled up soft taco. The meal was very good and very filling - but I didn't stop there...  thanks to my mobile app for Yelp I detected the review indicating if I passed on the sizzling brownie I was selling myself short - so I went for it. It did not disappoint! Stuart brought out the brownie, the butter cream and ice cream separately and prepared the dish. The plate was hot cast iron, the brownie went on, mushed in a spot for the vanilla ice cream and put the sauce on the plate. It started to sizzle and smelled almost of butterscotch. He spooned it on top of the ice cream. My mom said "this is the best dessert I have ever had!"  The good quality was good (the sauce on the chicken enchiada was excellent) and the service was awesome. Stuart kept the drinks filled and prepared the guacamole and brownie well at the table. Very nice guy too. It was a bit pricey - 3 lunches, the guacamole and dessert for $63 ($75 after tip), but it was very good. I will be back - if nothing else, for the guac and brownie!

First, I love Teppanyaki restaurants. It is always a fun time introducing new people to those type of restaurants. Benihana was my second choice, but Option A was closed. Being a chain, I knew I had a good shot it would still be in business. I prefer the smaller restaurants - typically more entertainment and lower cost, but Benihana is typically good and it is open.  There were 3 chefs working yesterday and we got the white guy. He was nice, but he wasn't as good as the ones at the other tables. This isn't him, because the other chefs didn't do it either, but there was no volcano like every other teppanyaki place does and no big flame to clean the grill. Probably being a chain they are more worried about law suits resulting from fire. Instead of volcano with flame, it was a train with smoke.   Benihana is more expensive than other places, but considering it is like dinner and a show, it isn't bad. The show part was not as good as it could be. The chef was okay and for the first timers with me, they thought it was good. The flavor of the food was okay, but not the best I have had. It was just kind of ho-hum for me. Interestingly enough after he was finished with our table, the chef went to another table that was all Asian customers. I wondered to myself what they must think getting the one white guy in the place - then the loud clanking noise of him dropping the cart and the food on the ground told me they probably weren't impressed.   For 2 people ordered one of the standard combos and water, it was $65 ($80 after tip). A little expensive for the lackluster performance and average quality of the food. I would recommend finding a smaller local establishment. At least they usually throw shrimp at you and douse you with saki if you catch it.

This year's run I thought was better than previous years. The headliner concert was in the afternoon rather than later in the evening, which made it easier for people to attend...from what I hear - I passed out after the run and missed the concert again.   The course is flat with minor hills in the back portion around mile 10. Despite flat and fast, I always seem to run a little slower here than other courses. This year they presented a nice running tech shirt rather than the cotton ones in the past.  The shuttle service is great - but the past two years I have preferred to take the light rail. It is about a 1 mile walk from the light rail to the start, but it is a nice warm up. This years 50K was cool and I find the expo is always nice. Big names with Dean Karnazes, Ryan Hall and Deena Kastor. My company now has jumped in and started sponsoring us, so I will continue to sign up. A good way to start off the year!

I have completed this event five times now and it is one that I continue to support because it is local. In the past the event started at the state capital and finished at Sun Devil stadium. This year the course was changed. Full marathon runners started downtown while the half marathon runners started on Mill Avenue. The finish was the same location.  I still do not like the finish line because that home stretch is a long and winding road that never seems to end, and the headliner concerts still are weak. This year was the B-52's. Someone who has been relevant in the past decade would be nice.  I did like the new course for the half marathon, although I did feel it was a little hillier in miles 7-10 than in the past. After the hill around Papago it is mostly downhill from there to the finish. This year they had a booth where runners who also ran in Vegas could pick up their double down medal there instead of waiting 6-8 weeks to get it in the mail. That was good. The frozen yogurt was a nice touch (thanks, Mojo!) The volunteers were great as always and the event overall is a good time. Plus this year I beat my personal best time not only for the PF Chang but for a half marathon. Wooo!

Pub crawl stop 3: By this time, the rum drinks, vodka and beers were catching up to me as I made my way to Chronic Tacos. There was only one other person with the Light Rail shirt on, so maybe they didn't know either. The flyer promoted 2 pints of Bud Light, Land Shark, Stella, Kona or Widmer...I ordered Stella and it came in a plastic cup for $4. The bar was packed with people, both inside and outside...I sat at a booth and worked on my drink...I finally had to find the bathroom and I wasn't impressed with that either. It appeared to be a one-person room, but typically two guys went in together. It had an open seat toiled and a urinal, but I would classify it as recommended for one person...so I was a little displeased when another guy walked in with me. After sitting back at my booth, I was starting to feel a little hungry and thought mmm tacos...but maybe that was a different part of the bar? The portion I was in only had drinks and I didn't see anyone else eating...which in my drunken state of mind I wondered why is it called Chronic Tacos if there are no tacos?   I didn't like this place because I was screwed on the drink price, I wanted a taco and the bathroom situation.

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite happy hour spots. In my previous review I wrote about the food - skip that, just come to happy hour. The happy hour runs from 4pm - 7pm and it includes half price drinks and select apps.  Get there early and find seating on the patio, it makes it even more enjoyable.  Yesterday I saw these ladies at another table enjoying a drink in a fish bowl and it had a plastic shark. I was intrigued, and actually walked over to talk to them and see what it was. Turns out its called a Tidy Bowl and even at happy hour it is $10. But it is a margarita  has 4 shots of Cabo Wabo, and the server told me it was the single strongest drink they could sell. I had to have one. One of my favorite beers is Kilt Lifter and they have the best prices - $2.25 at happy hour.  I also sampled the wings - one dozen hot wings for $2.50.  Not a bad night! One fish bowl, 3 Kilt Lifters, a dozen wings and a diet coke for my friend - $20. Say what?! Definitely come try it out - then when you are sloshed, walk around the corner and hit up Slices for some pizza to soak it all up.

It must be sushi week for me, as this was my second helping in 4 days. I met a friend here for lunch after a morning at the movies. I used to visit Kabuki frequently when I first started working in my current position, but then a group of friends reported not feeling well after a visit and I had not returned in the year since then. Upon further review, I seem to have forgotten to include that side note when recommending to my friend that we eat there. My bad.    We arrived about 12:30 on Sunday. We discovered the menu indicating select items were on sale during Cardinal game days. By one item from a section of the menu at regular price and another item in that section was $1. Good news - the Cardinals were playing (well, at least they suited up for the game), but I digress...as you may have seen from prior reviews of mine, I am limited in my sushi knowledge. I went for the comfort zone and ordered the Philadelphia roll. I can't really tell you what we had - I do remember to Kiren beer, the Philly roll, a lotus roll, something with scallops...something else...I can't forget her eel (which I reluctantly tried a teenie tiny corner of, but really it wasn't bad.  The restaurant has a nice appearance. Very comfortable and spacious. It was not crowded at all, which made for a nice dining experience. The waiter was very cool, gave us time to review the menu and provided excellent service.    I am still not sure what I ate, but I was in good hands with our waiter and my dining partner. I would totally trust her recommendations any time - unless she made me eat that whole eel. Then I might have to reconsider...It was an enjoyable afternoon and I will definitely return to Kabuki again.

Cartel Coffee is the best place for coffee in town. They also have beer, which is a plus. I have had the opportunity to enjoy both, and I would go there any time. The coffee is smooth and excellent. They have roast their own beans, they have a nice cold press system, and the atmosphere in relaxing. I met a friend recently for coffee while she was in town. We both had the Chai ($5) and it was the best.  They have a beer tasting room that is open Thursday nights and they produce excellent beer. I had the privilege about six months ago of brewing a beer with them (Cartel The Real Vanilla Heat). The brewers are very cool guys and helped me learn the brewing process. It was really a cool experience to not only see how beer is made, but to actually do it. Their FYITM is amazing. Last year they had a couple others (What's up Doc and Fuktunna Coffee and Donuts) that were incredible.   Any time I am in Tempe and looking for coffee or a nice beer, this would be the place to go

This place is literally within walking distance from my apartment, yet I have passed by it daily. This morning I was hungry for breakfast and had a lot of things to do so I thought I would try something close. I have noticed the parking lot is usually full, so I thought it must be good. I had no idea what type of food they had or what to expect.  It was Sunday morning just around 9:30 and I was fortunate to be able to walk in and instantly have a table. The server was very friendly and she checked back often always refilling my coffee. The menu is a little newspaper and it's a bit overwhelming with many options, but I finally settled on the volcano. It is described as three pancakes, 2 sausage links, 2 bacon strips, and an egg. The pancakes are three different sizes and stacked to create a volcano with the egg on top. It was under $9 and I was surprised at the size of it! I attempted but could not finish it. The big pancake was left uneaten. They do have a smaller option for around $6 and that might be the better way to go unless you have just returned from a month long trip through the jungle or plan to share with someone.   The server continued to check on me and even offered up a to go cup of coffee. I don't know how I have overlooked this place but based on the experience today, I would put it right at the top of best spots in town for breakfast. I will say come early because by the time I was leaving the lobby was full, people were milling around the parking lot, and the wait to be seated was 15 minutes.

There is an obvious mental disconnect between my present day and past selves. Although I don't eat much now, when looking over the menu the fat boy in me still says yes, I want that. In the past I used to go to Mexican restaurants and order the taco, burrito, enchilada special so after seeing a Groupon for Blue Adobe Grille (although I didn't purchase it), I stopped after being in the area. I noticed the Santa CaFe - which allows customers to choose two or three items from a list of about 6. Pork tamale sounded good, as well as the shredded beef taco, and to complete the trifecta a chicken enchilada.   The meal began with complimentary tri-colored chips with a nice chipotle salsa. I had some of those, along with a frozen margarita with the Chambord float (called the Old School Float). I also finished off two waters. When the plate arrived it had a side of pinto beans and rice (both excellent, by the way). I saw the taco and at first glance didn't think anything of it, but when I went to wrangle it I realized it was the fattest taco I have seen in my life. Suddenly I felt as if I were on an episode of Man vs. Food. I started on the taco and used the napkin in hand technique perfected by Adam Richman. The taco had a nice dizzled sauce on top that had a little heat and a double layer of tortilla to hold the tasty contents. I felt full - but that can't be - it was just a taco...I had to at least make an attempt at the enchilada and tamale. I had a bite of each and had to throw in the towel. In this battle of man vs. food - food won.

I like the products offered at Sports Chalet and have shopped here since they opened this location a couple of years ago. The service on the other hand leaves much to be desired. I know there is a recession and retailers are still operating at times with short staffs, but maybe if you had some workers, you would sell a product or two. I stopped by Sports Chalet today at lunch and made 8 to 9 laps around the store looking for a couple of products. No workers approached me to ask if I needed help or wanted to see anything - in fact no workers in site except for the two ladies at the front counter. A couple of loops through the shoe department and I found what could have been what I was looking for, but on further inspection, it wasn't. Finally someone approached and asked if I was finding everything or had questions. I was looking for the pouch that can hold the Nike Plus chip on a shoelace for non-Nike shoes. What I had in my hand was a mini wallet that would hold your key and maybe an ID. I asked the worker if that was the product I was looking for - clearly not knowing what he was selling he said yes, that's what I needed. I never did find the other things I was looking for or the correct product. I put it down and found what I needed at RoadRunner.  Sports Chalet isn't bad if you know what you are looking for and can find it yourself - but don't expect help from the sales staff. Any knowledgeable help anyway.

In my ranking of burger joints, I am not sure exactly where Two Hippies would fall - it was fairly comparable to most other options. I would give it the edge on number of varieties and the fries come close in quantity to matching Five Guys. Although not flavored, I did prefer Two Hippies fries.   I ordered the French Ass Burger. Having just returned from France I figured, why not? It had garlic and an aioli sauce that made for a descent flavor. Maybe I shouldn't have gone with that for my first experience, but it was good. The soda selection involves various varieties of Shasta - which I haven't seen since around 1978. On the downside, it is cash only. Fortunately this was a rare occasion when I carried cash. Also seating is limited. There are about 6 seats at around the inside of the restaurant, and while there is a back patio and a front patio, I wouldn't really want to eat outside in the summer. The price was good - the huge French Ass Burger, a Shasta and bag of fries was $7, but then I added the Two Hippies Magic Brownie (how could I pass that) for another $2.   The restaurant is not really close to me, so I won't be a frequent customer, but if I hind myself around that part of town and a hankerin' for a big ass burger, I would stop again.

This place sucked and I don't feel the need to return. Friends from work were planning a birthday happy hour and called two weeks ago to find out information on providing a location for the event. Approximately 20 people would be coming and the person making the call asked if that would be an issue and if reservations needed to be made. She was told no, it would be fine. The restaurant is very spacious, so it could easily handle a group that size.   My friend and I arrived first yesterday to secure the tables. The hostess said she didn't think she could accommodate us because they did have several parties that made reservations. She hesitated, but eventually said she could probably put about 15 in one area, which we accepted. It took a while, but the staff assembled three or four tables to provide the area we needed. We went ahead and sat down and my friend asked the waiter when happy hour began and what specials they had. The waiter stated the happy hour was only in the bar area or patio, and not at the tables. He left and then a manager came out and repeated the same thing. My friend asked what if people walked to the bar, ordered and paid for the drink and returned to the table. The manager said no, you can't do that. We explained there would be people at the table eating in the restaurant portion, but there might be people order drinks from the bar and come back. The manager said if that were to happen, he couldn't hold the tables for us. While the explanation was occurring the waiter was kind enough to bring out some water for us, and a third member of our party showed up to order a diet coke and was planning on getting the quesadilla, but waited. Soon it became clear this place would not work out too well for the party.  Looking over the menu, the prices seemed too high for a bar with a bull in inside. $10 burgers, egg rolls for $9, $8 quesadillas, $10 salads and $9 specialty drinks.  Happy hour prices the specialty drinks come down to $5, imports and well drinks for $3 and domestics for $2 - but again, only in the bar and only in the first-come-first-serve patio area.  If you have a large group, you most likely won't be to be in one of those areas or see those prices.  I do know some restaurants keep the happy hour prices contained to certain areas, but it typically depends on the restaurant structure. A place, for example Applebees, is mostly restaurant and happens to have a bar, so it would make sense to keep the prices separate. Cadillac Ranch is more bar than restaurant. I don't know too many places trying to promote a nice restaurant image that would have a mechanical bull in main area.  Apparently the management is not interested in the revenue that 15-20 people eating and drinking all night would generate.  After the manager's conversation, the waiter was a little slow in returning. I walked down to San Felipe but they could not accommodate our party at the last minute. In the end, we found a suitable location that provided the service, the happy hour pricing and atmosphere we wanted.  Thanks, Cadillac Ranch, but no thanks.

Don't be fooled by happy hour prices. I went yesterday and the waitress talked about 1/2 price appetizers, drinks, well drinks, etc. That price is only good at the bar. If you are at a table you will not get it. I went with some friends and we ordered drinks and appetizers. An order of chicken wings, an order of pretzels, 2 double vodka & 7ups, a single vodka & 7up and 4 coke & crowns. All ordered before 7pm when happy hour is over. Total price $ 71. Someone in management must have ridden that bull and hit their head - and the waitresses false advertise until the bill comes. If you are out for a happy hour in Tempe drive on past this place.

I had a fantastic time here this evening. I came during happy hour and tried the California roll and Garden Gecko. I thought since it was tempura shrimp and seared tuna it would count as me being adventurous with sushi. I texted Andrea K. and she confirmed no, that doesn't count. Still - it was good and thet drink prices at happy hour were excellent. Just go with things that have a smiley face and they are half price until 6.   The waitress, Heather took good care of us - and soon my attention turned to sake. A gecko roll, California roll, 2 Kiren Ichibans and 2 caraffes of sake - $23. Nice! Heather was very cool and had a most excellent tattoo. She was even friendly after we walked back to the car after being tossed from Gordon Biersch. What a cool waitress. She let us sit for a long time and continued to wait on us. I would come back here any time for happy hour.

One of my favorite places in Queen Creek (but then again there really aren't any other sit down places). The Flatiron is a great value at $10 for a steak, compared to other options. To be honest the salad is a bit scary. Kind of like a house salad from a lunch wagon. I would love to sit around the camp fire one slightly chilly night with a bag of marshmellows. Maybe soon. Ther service has always been good for me.

I went for lunch and I thought it was pretty sweet. It was slow in the afternoon, so the bartender come out and served us. He was cool and the food was quick.I  My friend had a hamburger (which I got a taste of) and it was good. I ordered the crab cake sandwich for $9.95 and shut my mouf! - two crab cakes for $10? They were big, so I actually pulled one off and straightened the other up to make a proper sandwich. The saurce was on the side and had a bit of horshradish. The fries were typical fries. The little bread items they brought out first were good, but very buttery/oily. I had two bottles of beer from the lunch special and enjoyed the time. It was a $30 lunch for two, but I will be back. Nice!

I wanted somewhere close, but good for a birthday dinner this evening. Red, White & Brew is a spot that I have been to once for lunch and another time for dinner -both times were excellent. I am pleased that this time and the previous time I have arrived for dinner, the place was busy. My lunch experience was with an empty restaurant and I was worried about the future of the business. Good to see others are getting behind a good local restaurant.  I am hoping that this year i will be more adventurous and return to the fun ways for which I was formerly known...looking over the menu I could have taken a standard pizza or burger - no doubt they would be good, but that sounded to blasé. Instead, I went with one of tonight's dinner specials: red chili, citrus and cilantro marinated Thresher shark skewers with red & green bell peppers, long grain wild rice and "fresh vegetables" ($16.50) ...those vegetables appeared to be orange and yellow carrots. I have never had shark, so let the adventure begin! The waiter was a cool dude who looked like he just parked the surf board outback. The meal was excellent.  The meals are not the cheapest, but the portions are huge. As you can see from the photo, I received two huge skewers of shark, plus the veggies & rice. While typically a bonus, it was a downer tonight - I am going out of town tomorrow for 10 days, so left overs do not really fit into the plan. I ate one skewer and had to throw the other back to sea. $16.50 for the shark skewers. I washed it down the a $3.50 large draft Hefeweizen from Four Peaks. Delish!  In an attempt to add to my Happy Finish list I ordered the chocolate midnight temptation cake. A) it's my birthday so there should be cake, right B) Who doesn't love midnight temptation? The menu proclaimed layers of chocolate with a rich creamy ganache and a hint of cherry. Someone might need to enlighten them on the definition of "hint"...I have limited taste buds due to an unfortunate knife to tongue situation as a kid...long story...but there was an over abundance of cherry. Too much to be enjoyable really...and the creamy ganache? More like the white spooge (can I say that?!) of a Cadbury egg. Yuck...So the chocolate temptation cake was not so much a happy finish and didn't make my list, but it was $5.50 and didn't completely suck.  One thing I would love to see would be half portions. As I mentioned, I couldn't eat all of it, nor could my friend. You can see her chicken marsala in the pictures and again, most went to waste. I did ask the waiter and he indicated they do not have smaller portions. It might be a good option...but still, I love this place!

Wanting to try someplace new and a bit out of the ordinary, I had lunch at the Islamorada Fish Company, which is attached to the Bass Pro Shop at the 202 & Dobson Rd. I have never been to the Bass Pro Shop, but have heard that they have a good restaurant.  The restaurant was large - I didn't even make it into the store. I didn't feel like I was in Key West, despite the Jimmy Buffet music playing. I felt like a Red Lobster exploded. It was much larger than Red Lobster, but the décor was similar. One key feature was the large aquarium behind the bar. Fish were circling on the ceiling and there were photos of fish people had caught on the walls.   The menu had a large selection to choose from. I ended up choosing the Pan Fried Trout with potatoes, corn and a corn muffin ($11.99). The first item to arrive was a mini-loaf of bread. The bread was good, but it had a bit of honey glazed across it, which made it sticky. I liked the bread, but wasn't impressed with the sticky sensation. Next thing to arrive was the trout. It came on a cast iron skillet and I felt if I were a kid, went fishing with my grandfather and fried up the day's haul...except I never did those things and there were no heads and cleaning wasn't required. BUT if I had caught fish with my grandfather and cooked it on a cast iron skillet over a camp fire, this might be what it would taste like. All the fun of fishing and camping, but without the nasty parts. The trout arrived with a lemon and a sprig of rosemary. The thickly cut potatoes were seasoned with salt and pepper and quite tasty. The corn, not so much. It was grilled, but tasted like a twice-grilled unflavored Niblet that stuck to your teeth. Save some for later I suppose.  The corn muffin was dry, corn-mealy and kind of tasteless. I ordered dessert - the apple pie - and it was cast iron galore again. A scoop of ice cream with the pie and it was a nice end to a tasty meal.   The restaurant wasn't busy, despite it being lunchtime on the 4th of July. Even the bathrooms were nice - big and clean. The only downside was when I walked in to wash the sticky honey off of my hands and a guy was sitting in the stall holding a conversation on his cell phone.   I would definitely try this place again. Good food and the service wasn't bad either.

This is definitely one of the more interesting places in Queen Creek. Agri-tourism is a growing business, mostly applicable to wineries. People want to visit and see where products are produced and how they are made. The Queen Creek Olive Mill operates very similarly to a winery - it has a nice layout, produces short run presses of specialty blends and holds tastings. The tasting used to be free, but too many people treated it like a buffet, so now it is in the back and part of the $5 tour.   In addition to various blends of olive oil, the Olive Mill carries wines, gifts, and some very good pistachios grown by monks in Florence. I love the jalapeño pistachios. I have bought the Bianco blend (which Pizza Bianco uses for their pizza), but my favorite is the chili olive oil - it adds a nice kick to whatever dish you are cooking.   The Mill also has an offering of sandwiches and gelato. They pride themselves on using local ingredients - the bread is fresh and local, the meats come from The Pork Shop down the road. A small garden out front grows the herbs and vegetables used in the deli.  In the nice spring afternoons, there is nothing like sitting outside in the mini orchard and enjoying a sandwich in a nice environment. It's not Tuscany, but maybe if you squint you will think so. For me it is just a short 1 mile ride home and does not require passports or airport security body searches.  Come see Arizona's only olive mill and take home some bottles of their fine oil.

I stopped by yesterday for a Zumba class with my friend. What an incredible facility! Nice jogging trail, state of the art machines, two large courts for basketball. AND they had Dance Dance Revolution! I only wish I lived closer so I could visit more often! For those without a pass, it only costs $4 for a day pass. Well worth it!

During lunch I stopped by Best Buy to pick up a web cam...I know what you are thinking, and no it isn't for that...how you doin'?!But it is good to know if times get tough I can turn that on and charge $3.99 per minute and make some cash...  Best Buy is hit or miss with customer service. I have been in stores previously to purchase a DVD and had 6 different people ask me if I need help. It's nice to have assistance, but that is over the top. On the other hand I have also purchased six large LCD flat screen TVs and had to hunt for assistance. They do not seem to know where the happy medium is...today was on the ghost town end of the spectrum - despite several employees standing around talking with each other. Finally after asking assistance, I was directed to the correct aisle. Looking at the options, I narrowed it down to 2 possible choices. Both were the same price and appeared to be similar in specifications. Looking around for assistance...Hello? Hello? Tumbleweed could have passed across the aisle. Finally I determined they were about the same and just picked one.   No one was in line except four cashiers huddled together. The check out process was good, and the cashier remembered to ask for my Reward Zone card. Nice touch. Often they forget. A slight boost in the stars because she was also exceptionally cute.    Another thing I was impressed with was the selection of Blu-Ray DVDs descending in price. They had a large display of Blu-Rays on sale - some as low as $9.99, but most $12.99-$14.99. Impressive! Despite the ghost town or Blitzkrieg extreme in customer service, I will continue to shop here because I like their selection and if you need to pin someone down, they are actually knowledgable.

Good selection of running shoes and clothing. They can do a running analysis to give good insight on how you run and which type of shoes are best for your style. Knowledgeable staff helpful with answers to questions. I went at lunch on a Wednesday and they had four employees working - enough to handle questions and provide a running assessment to a customer. I purchased The RPI sprinter stick today and received good information from the sales clerk. Some businesses also have a discount, so check into that. My company has a 20% discount, as does my affiliation with Arizona Road Racers. The store also sells a VIP card for $20 annually that provides and additional discount. If you have the VIP card and belong to a group or work at a company with a discount, you can save a good amount of money. You can also pick up the latest running magazines and as well as pamphlets for upcoming local races.

Free Group run! Hundreds of dollars in free prizes! Free beer! Where they do that at? At Road Runner Sports - come for the Third Thursday Adventure Fun run every...you guessed it...third Thursday. A little hint - spend the $25 to buy the shirt. It gives you double the raffle coupons and is a nice tech shirt to boot. Here's how it goes down: 6 pm the map drops from a large van. There are 8 check points (including some secret ones on Facebook). Basically run what you can, hit the check points, gather the tickets and get your butt back to Road Runner by 7 pm and your tickets are entered in a raffle for free prizes. You can even try products for (you guessed it) free! Tonight I tried a fuel belt. There was also the opportunity to try Puma shoes, chips, and even Garmins.  The sales folks have always been helpful when I have been there. The store has a wide selection of shoes and clothes. The service and products are great, but this new free run really puts them over the top for me. I guess it's not "new"...tonight was the third running.  The only thing I was going to negatively rate was the VIP program. It is $20 and I thought it was a one time fee and not an annual charge...but re-reading my initial review, my own words state $20 annually...so who's the dumbass now? If you go frequently, the $20 will be saved quickly, but just remember it is automatically charged next year.

Coming out of Men's Warehouse I was hungry and was drawn by the smell in the parking lot - looking around I noticed Waldo's BBQ and determined that was the place. I walked in and was promptly seated. I thought the deco was nice and the dining area large. It wasn't very busy at the time, but it was still noisy.  A couple of kids were in the restaurant banging their feet and screaming. I thought someone in the back just stuck the pig.   Looking at the menu with the mason jar of sweet tea and a BBQ Baker (which is a baked potato topped with your choice of meat) The waitress brought out two plates with Mexican corn bread and took our order for tea. I thought could it be? Maybe this will finally be good BBQ in Arizona and replace what I lost in Atlanta. My friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw on the side instead of on the sandwich was advertised. I went with the sampler - chicken, pork and beef.  We each chose the horsey potatoes (mashed potatoes with a hint or horseradish) as our side. I also got sweet potato fries with my dish. She asked if we would like an order of onion rings for $2 - and when the rings came out they were excellent. Okay, I am done with the highlights...  The sweet tea was descent, but not that sweet - and disappointing to me was the lack of refills. I don't know if they were not available or I was just not offered one, but either way my drink went empty. For the sampler I was envisioning maybe a piece of chicken, a small piece of beef and a small piece of pork. Instead it was a plate of pulled various meet. The BBQ sauce was served separately in a bowl that I had to spoon out and drizzle over the meat. The mashed potatoes were a little runny and did have a hint of horseradish, but were overall non-impressive.  The sweet potato fries appeared to be frozen. Maybe they weren't, but they were thin, had an odd appearance and no flavor at all. If someone blindfolded me and allowed me to eat it I wouldn't know it was sweet potato.   The server had limited personality. She tried to talk about the Super Bowl and how last year she worked by herself and it was slow, but that was about it. When she came back and asked if we needed a box, our answer of no appeared to disappoint her as we did have food left.  There were several dishes on the table, which she didn't remove. When she checked up on us and we ordered the warm pecan pie with the side of ice cream, she didn't remove dishes. Only when the dessert came out and she had no room to sit the plate down did she remove dishes - and then it was only enough to make space. The rest remained on the table.  The pie, by the way, was lukewarm at best - not warm enough to even melt the ice cream slightly.  Finally another woman wearing a staff shirt came back and cleared the dishes.   As we were finishing I noticed several people coming in - and looking around the place had filled up since we entered. She ran the credit card and brought the receipt back saying you guys better go before I get busy...Don't worry, I will get going. Leaving the restaurant I noticed the sign in the window that said "Sorry, We're Open" ... that makes two of us...  The hunt continues for good desert BBQ. This was not it.

A former coworker and I stumbled upon this place for lunch. As the other reviews said there is limited parking (park across the street at Arby's), the neighborhood is sketchy with guys hanging around outside, and seating inside is limited - but it is worth the obstacles to come here. We ordered the Margarita pizza and it was absolutely the best I have had this side of Naples.   Fred M. mentioned he was downgrading since the bread and tapenada was gone - time to give that point back because they were served with our meal.The staff was friendly and the pizza was incredible. Reasonably priced too. Give this place a try!

I stopped by Dutch Brothers one night after watching a show at Gammage. Now it has become my post-play routine. The location is convenient in Tempe; in the parking lot with Monkey Pants. It is a small drive up window similar to the old Foto Mats in the 1970's. I have ordered the hot chocolate, the Kahlua Kicker and most recently the Milky Way. Dang that's good stuff-  the Milk Way has espresso, caramel sauce (who doesn't love that?) and chocolate blend milk. Yummy!   Each time I have visited this location it has been about 9:30-10:00 on a Saturday night and the same dude has been working. He is fast, friendly and talkative. Must be kind of lonely sitting in a box in the parking lot all night, but fortunately for him the location seems to be popular.   I didn't go five stars because the cup is a little hot. No little cardboard ring for insulation and I find it is challenging to drive without letting it cool down slightly. But otherwise, excellent.  I enjoy the experience of coming here more so than Starbucks and I can't wait to come back - good thing my next play is this Saturday night. Bring on the Dutch Brothers!

I have walked past D'Arcy McGee's several times, but have never stopped inside. In trying to find a location for a large happy hour to honor three co-worker birthdays, we initially stopped by another restaurant in the Tempe Marketplace.  That turned out to be a bust thanks to poor service, so we scrambled for a new location before everyone else showed up. D'Arcy McGee's was able to handle the request and allocate large spacing on the patio for all of us.   The bar had a nice selection of happy hour items from 4-6, including $3 Harp, Guinness, and one of my increasingly favorite beers the Four Peaks Kilt lifter. The happy hour prices did not extend to food, but our party ordered the baked brie, the chicken wings, the vegetarian grill bread and the mini Yorkshire puddings. Each was about $9-$10, but very tasty. The waitress kept the drinks filled and made sure to come by more quickly as happy hour came to a close. I ordered another drink 10 minutes before happy hour and a few minutes later the waitress brought me a second drink seconds later.   The atmosphere was great, the service was wonderful and the staff was able to help our party out at the last minute. The evening turned out to be a good time.

I love this place - right across the street from my office. I usually go for the chicken bowl. You can get it with brown rice, white meat only if you wish. I have had the beef & chicken bowl, the California rolls, the Las Vegas rolls and the Philly Roll. The staff is very friendly and the food is quick - even though the place is usually packed at lunch. If I go out at lunch, 9 times out of 10 it is here.

Confident after my Yelp outing at Taj Mahal a few weeks ago, I set out on my own to test the lunch buffet. The restaurant was great with a large group, but I wanted to go again to see if they were playing up to the known large crowd that night. Still my knowledge of Indian food is very limited, but I knew I had a variety of dishes at the Yelp event and they were all good - so even though I might not what it was, I was confident it would taste good. I was not disappointed! The lunch buffet is $7.99 and features many selections, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I did not try the soups, salads, chutneys or desserts - I was too full to venture that far down the buffet line. I recognized the tandori chicken, tried an egg curry and a couple of other chicken dishes. In addition to the items on the buffet, I was served a large basket of garlic naan. Being a buffet, the food is catered toward a larger audience, so it was not very spicy. That is good for a newbie like me, but some of the more veteran Indian eaters may prefer to order off the menu.   I recognized the guy working as one of the gentleman from the night of the Yelp event. He is very friendly, kept the drinks full and even took another customer over to the buffet to explain one of the dishes.   I like the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. It feels comfortable with enough space for everyone, a nice big photo of the Taj Mahal and Bollywood movies or videos playing in the background. I enjoyed the buffet as much as the dinner a few weeks ago. Anytime in the future I plan to go for Indian food, this will be the place.

I enjoy the Keg. I have been to other locations, but this was my first time at the Tempe Market place location. The atmosphere was very nice and my party and I were able to talk and have a good time. I had some issues with the meal, but in reality I think they were mostly user error. I was going to go for the steak and seafood special, but when my friend ordered a salad, I realized that special did not come with salad. Instead I went for the top sirloin because it said potato and salad - but apparently there is a top sirloin classic. It seems that I ordered the one without the salad. My friend ordered a prime rib and she said she liked it, so I will go with that - but for me, it was under cooked. Prime rib is typically medium rare and pink throughout, but this was solid red like it just came off the Bashsa's shelf. I would have sent it back, but she liked it.  The desserts were excellent. Each person in my party had a different one - the coffee ice cream cake, the cream brulee, the chocolate cake and a cheese cake. YUM-O  The service was good and the quality of the food (although not what I was expecting) was very good. I have learned to listen to my friend and not change my mind at the last minute and to read the menu details before ordering :)

I don't look for food now based on what sounds good. I ask myself what haven't I Yelped? For lunch, the answer was Brio. While sitting in the car outside the restaurant I consult my Yelp application on iPhone and noticed Matt S. had been there and reviewed the restaurant just last week. One thing I have learned, if Matt says its good, its good.   The first impression I had walking in was "wow!" The deco was awesome - the fabric covered chairs reminded me of the Hotel Monaco, the style and detail was something I wouldn't expect to find in Gilbert. Service was excellent - Tom, our waiter, arrived quickly and asked if this was our first visit. He offered to bring some water while we familiarized ourselves with the menu and upon his return, he went over the specials as well as introduced some of the more popular plates. The bread and tortilla was excellent - nice herbs and flavor.   Following Matt's review, I ordered the spicy eggplant and shrimp appetizer. Tom said it was the best app on the menu. The eggplant was fried, topped with a shrimp and bedded in an excellent spicy sauce. Yum!At $9 it sounds a little pricey for an app, but it was great size. Even if we had a party of 4, there would still be enough for a couple per person. As it was with two of us, there was plenty.   My friend ordered the Mezza lasagna & insalata - the salad was a smaller version of one of three standard salads (she chose the Chopped Salad). The lasagna was good, not very thick, but definitely rich. It wasn't outstanding, but had a good flavor and was very cheesy. The price was $12.95, which wasn't bad considering a side salad alone is $4. Good value with the combo.  I wanted something a little different. I went with one of Tom's suggestions - the Eggs Oscar. Many, this dish was loaded with flavor! Two poached eggs, a small crab & shrimp cake, potatoes, asparagus, artichokes, spinach, red peppers and topped with lemon butter & hollandaise sauce. The size of the portion was huge and worth the $13.95.   The reviews for dessert were good, and I do have my Happy Finish list to work on, so as tough as it was, I had to push forward. It is for research after all. I am not doing this for me, but for all of the Yelp readers...Tom brought out a plate of 8 mini desserts and a cake. There were 3 types of Crème Brulee on the tray, tiramisu, cheesecake, cobbler and apple nut bread pudding. It should be mentioned that this mini desserts are only $2.45 - you can order the crème brulee trio for $6.50 or the dessert sample featuring the other 5 items for $10.95. Good deal if you have trouble deciding. We chose the cake and wow! Save room for dessert!! This was a chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream, chocolate ganache, what they called vanilla whipped cream, but it was more of a vanilla sauce (excellent) and a dusting of chocolate powder. Topped with pirouette cookie.   The total bill was about $45, which is a little high for brunch, but the service was great, atmosphere excellent and food incredible. Definite happy finish with the dessert.  As others have said, this is definitely worth the price.

I previously wrote a review about this bar, but it no longer seems to be on the web site. I have been here multiple times and the food and beer is always consistent. Irish nachos are great, the beer is good, and they have a monthly beer special. I also liked it because it was next to my apartment and a good location on GIlbert & Baseline. A lot of traffic in this area. So why then is the bar usually empty? I have been here on Friday nights, Saturday nights, and other times most bars would be busy and yet it was not here. In my previous review I included photos showing how empty the bar was and how they had more televisions than patrons. The problem is the bar is marketed toward men who are come there as much for the women working as they do beer, food, or televisions. But too frequently when I visited they had no women. The host was a dude, the server was a dude, the bartender was a dude. On two prior occasions I saw one "Kilt girl". Instead it was dudes in kilts. If I wanted to see that I would stay at home, dig my kilt out of the drawer, and look at myself in the mirror. I did go about two weeks ago and I saw a difference - everyone working (the desk, servers, and bar) were Kilt Girls.   Apparently the change was too little, too late. I saw the signs up yesterday (because I always chuckled at the "Voted Phoenix Number 1 Sports bar" sign on the side of the building when the bar was usually empty), but today I was surprised to see no signage at all. That stupid sign was down, the name on the building, and the name on the sign all gone. The corporate web site no longer shows the Mesa location and going to their page directly shows Page Not Found Sorry, that page no longer exists...  I was surprised at the suddeness of operational one day, gone the next but I can't say I am surprised it was closed.

I definitely love jerk chicken - this is my third review of a restaurant serving jerk chicken. This restaurant is actually the closest to my house - just about a mile away, but I had never been there until I located it on the Yelp mobile app.   The restaurant is located in a shopping center, right up front facing Arizona Avenue. Plenty of parking and good seating inside. They had reggae music playing and it was a comfortable environment while waiting. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the jerk chicken to go. She said they also had homemade ginger beer, so I ordered one while waiting on the food. The drink was an immediate strong hit of ginger, but settled into a nice refreshing drink.  I ate the chicken when I got home. I ordered it with a side of plantains and rice/peas. She was just baking the plantains when I ordered. Those were the first bite, and they were wonderful! the rice was good, then I went for the chicken. Wow! It was the spiciest I have ever had. Two bites in and my nose was running and I had hiccups. I loved it. It was a good portion and I ate  every bit of it.  With this restaurant just down the street and my experience with my first order. I definitely will be back. It would be nice with the spacious seating and good music to sit back with a ginger beer, relax, and eat it there next time. I will definitely be back.

I came for the cheesecake, which is always good. I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple. Excellent, but very rich. I ordered a hot chocolate, which in hindsight was maybe too much chocolate (if that's possible). One thing I didn't like was the presentation of the drink - typically you would expect to see hot chocolate in a mug, but this was a glass cup with two straws. To the passerbye it would appear to be chocolate milk. A little weird to me...  The service was good and the cheesecake was excellent. $6.50 per slice, but well worth it.

So I have a friend who reads my reviews from Yelp when they are posted on Facebook. Almost after every review she instructs me to have Thai - I guess good Thai food is in short supply in Athens, GA. Looking at the Yelp listings, that is not the case here.   Out of my available options near work, I chose Thai Elephant. I had good reviews, and let's face it, who doesn't love an elephant? The parking was easy to get into and the store was packed - a good sign of good food. I enjoyed the deco with paper lanterns.  The soup was the first course and it was a good thing I wasn't blind folded. I would have thought some scallions and a hint of pepper dropped in the lemon-Joy dishwater. Yuck. Thankfully the Thai tea removed all hint of soup. It was $2.25 for the tea and what a treat! I ordered the lunch special of drunken noodle with chicken - it is Thai wide noodles sauteed with jalapeno, yellow onion, carrots, broccoli, cabbage, bell pepper and basil. I could definitely taste the basil and although I responded "mild" to the question of mild vs. spicy - I am not sure what the spicy would have tasted like YIKES! Definitely bring a hankie for the mild. If you have sinus issues, have that! I have to say of the Thai places I have had, this ranks up there is the best. For $7.95 for the lunch portion, it was a great size and worth the price.   I also liked the staff did not harass me during eating. They brought the soup, the tea and the food. Once they asked if it was good and I didn't see them again until time for the check. Now one lady asked if I wanted the check, a different lady brought the check (to which I gave my card), then the first lady returned with the bill (until I said someone already brought it) and a third lady came by to ask if I needed my check. I guess they are very diligent on the payment end. But the food was great, so I will be back!

I know what you are thinking looking at my photo - dude, you're fat. You can't do yoga. Not only that but I am as flexible as a board. Nevertheless, I took advantage of the Groupon recently that provided one month unlimited yoga and a 60 minute Swedish massage for $50 - so I am definitely going to get as much as I can from the place.   One thing I really like is that it is conveniently located next to the light rail. The Osborne stop is right there in front of the studio. My first visit I thought it was difficult to find - the studio is on the side of the Lexington One building, but I couldn't see that from the street. There is a parking garage next to the studio which makes parking convenient if you drive.   The studio is very clean and peaceful. I like the boutique, although they do not have many fat boy clothes. The locker rooms are very nice and clean. I love the sinks. A locker is available to store your items while in class. The rooms where the classes are held are nice and spacious. I started with the Slow Flow class and have also went to the Zen class. Both instructors were excellent and even though I looked like Kung-Fu Panda, I didn't feel uncomfortable. It was interesting to see that the students were all ages, both men and women. A very good mix and all have been friendly. The staff is friendly and helpful. If you do not have a yoga mat, you can rent one for $2.  If you live in Central Phoenix, this would be an ideal location. The problem for me is that I live way out in Queen Creek, so I doubt I go on the weekends, but it isn't too bad coming from work. Definitely give this place a try if you live in town. Don't worry if you have never tried yoga - I have found the staff and instructors very helpful in working with newbies.

I thought I would treat myself to food that didn't come from a drive thru window tonight, so I drove a little further for dinner this evening. I have been to Texas Roadhouse multiple times - I love the rolls and the sweet tea. The first thing that was interesting tonight was the pager - they called it a pager, but it wasn't the typical pager device restaurants use - it was a piece of printed receipt paper with a number on it...did the recession kill pagers? Even more interesting was that they gave us a "pager" even though there was one couple in front of us and the wait was about 2 minutes.   The bread came out and was hot and excellent as always. The waitress was a bit overly perky - like Spartan Cheerleader perky. Maybe I am getting older, but the place was loud - I could barely hear from friend talking to me. The tea was definitely past-peak; the first glass was better than the second.   My friend ordered the roasted chicken and was pleased with the meal. I went with the sirloin and ordered it medium. The waitress brought the meals and I started on the sides, so when she asked how it was, it was fine. When I got to the steak it was well done - no pink, dry and chewy. Now the waitress wasn't to be found. When she finally returned she asked how it was and I let her know it was too well done. She did offer a new one, but I had things to get to, so I declined. She did take it off the bill.   The atmosphere was a negative for being loud, the steak was a negative for being miscooked. Although overly spunky, the service was good and she did offer to correct the food. i left her a descent tip, but left unpleased.   Dinner ended up coming from a drive thru window afterall as I hit up Wendy's on the way out (and it was overcooked too) :-(

Pub Crawl, stop 5: Another place that wasn't on the plan, but I was distracted by a cute girl handing me a flyer for 2 for 1 drinks. It was dark inside and mostly dead. Groups of 5 girls or more receive a free bottle of champagne, so obviously they are trying to get girls in the bar - the stripper pole among the couches was another clue. The dance floor was empty and there were just a handful of people in the bar. A group of 1 guy and 4 girls sat in the corner and eventually two girls went to the floor and started dancing with each other. That didn't really increase the crowd. I went upstairs and there was nothing happening up there. Back downstairs and more standing around.  After my second domestic beer, I had to find the restroom - which was nearly impossible to find. I was told it was upstairs. There wasn't a sign to direct customers and no one was upstairs. The DJ didn't pay attention to me as I tried to look behind the curtain. That was just an elevator. I found in another corner a couple of doors which appeared to be unmarked. I opened one and started to go in - but a lady came by and sad that was the women's...oops! I used the other and held onto the hand rail going down the stairs. It was nearly black and the steps didn't have markings on them, so I could see that it might be easy for someone to slip and tumble down the flight of stairs.   This place didn't do anything for me. Going up the stairs there were words on the stairs that would lead one to think of sexy things and photos on the wall show busty scantily clad girls. The web site said Whip Cream Saturday and thinking of the words and whip, I would have thought of a different type of club...I didn't see any of that and it was dead, so time to move on...

I offer up this haiku review...  Drinks on Friday Night Only non-employee there Two Ales and I left.   Let me 'splain...most places have happy hour and there is a crowd. I have been to others and it begins filling up at 4pm. The sign on the door said Arizona's longest happy hour - beginning at 2pm. That's nice, but apparently if you build it, they won't come. Friday night and I was there at 4. Everyone else there was an employee. Really? How can you get happy with yourself? Another guy came in, but he was evening help. Mike, who was very personable told the guy it has been a good day. The other guy said really? How so? He said he had a good lunch, a nice pop...and Mark came in...normally I do draw a crowd, but I must have been off tonight. I went with the recommended Whale Ale. The glass was big and heavy. Mike explained that all of the beers are served cold and the extra thick glass ensures they stay that way. Get there at 11 AM, he said, and it is excellent. The menu looked good-  Mike recommended the fish & chips, which are a favorite of mine, but I was leaning toward the crab reuben. Just sounded different - crab salad, ham and swiss - interesting. I had a second Wale Ale while thinking it over. Instead, nearing 5 pm, the place was still just me - so I requested the check and left.   They have events such as the Saturday night disco night and the Wednesday happy hour. Maybe one of those nights would be nice. The place was cool and the beer was good. I would like to try the food, but I don't want to go it alone. Anyone want to tag along?

Definitely a good place to go when I am down the street at World of Beer. They no longer deliver there, but it is a short walk down the block. Good selection of beer in the cooler. I always get it to go, but they do have some seating. My favorite is the Southern Slawdog, but the Chicago and the coney are both good too. Really, I would try anything here. Always good service, quick, and descent priced.

Tom T. Hall said it best it best when he said "I like beer. It makes me a jolly good fellow" - this place claims to have the world's largest selection of draft beer, and while I have not completed the research (would love to start), it had an impressive selection. The menu had 2 full pages of beer...that being said, I had water...I went with a friend for lunch before the University of Phoenix graduation ceremonies on Friday. Right around lunch time and with the early graduation already out and the afternoon starting a few hours later I figured it would be busier. Not the case. We went with a selection of various products from the menu - starting with the lobster, artichoke dip. Can you say yummy? That really hit the spot. Next we enjoyed the mixed greens salad, which really, well, it's a salad...and I try to avoid salads, but it was good. Next up was the prime rib French dip sandwich. The size was impressive - bigger than the one a few weeks ago at the Phoenix Greyhound Park and fairly tasty. The server was maybe just a touch slow. He was there at the beginning, but then as the time crunch hit, nowhere to be found. Typical. We unfortunately had to leave without dessert -but I would give it another go.

DAAAYUM!!! The previous reviews of this restaurant were very good and I set out to try it before...but it was closed. I forgot about it for a few weeks and decided to give it another shot this afternoon for lunch. I am so glad that I remembered this place!  I am not sure what I expected, but it wasn't this. The place is in the back corner of a little strip shopping center which was otherwise non-descript and I would probably have driven past unless I was specifically looking for something. As I approached I saw a nice size patio with outdoor seating. It was a nice day and I was tempted, but I went inside. The dining area was very spacious containing several tables without being overcrowded. Another thing that stood out was the smell. It smelled really good and it further increased my hunger.  The table was big, which is a good characteristic for me. I don't know how many places I go and they stick the big dude at the little table. I also thought the menu was cool. Nice thin wooden cover with an expansive listing of sandwiches, entrees, beers and wines. I would love to go back for the wine dinner, but being lunch I just ordered a sandwich. Another nice touch was the silverware. The waitress brought the silverware to the table in a mason jar. It is something different and really makes the place cool. Great atmosphere.  My friend ordered the chicken salad sandwich - which I don't care for chicken salad, but I did have a taste and it was good. Chicken, apples, nuts - very hardy. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was piled high. Good solid bread, thick meat and an incredible taste.  I had the potato salad side and my friend had the pasta salad. One thing I liked about both salads and the chicken salad also was the focus on flavor and ingredients. These items were not loaded down with mayo like so many other places. Instead, this restaurant let the main ingredients do the talking - the chicken salad made the chicken the focus item, followed by the apple and nuts. No heavy mayonnaise. Same with the potato salad - you tasted the Yukon yellow gold potatoes. The bread & butter pickles as a garnish took me back to my youth. My grandmother in Southern Ohio canned bread & butter pickles annually. Yum.  I had to go for dessert, but I went with something small. I went with the lemon bar - sweet, tart and tasty. I wouldn't go specifically for the lemon bar as I might with something like Oregano's cookie, but this was a good finish to the meal. The sandwiches were both $8.50 (and well worth it), the lemon bar was an economical $2. Another cool & funky aspect of dinner was the smashed bottle serving plate. I like quirky little touches like that which help make the experience unique and memorable.  Really the only thing that might be a fraction of a reduction for me was that it was a little loud and made it challenging to hear the conversation and the soda was a standard 20 oz bottle rather than a fountain drink. Small things and not really distracting from the overall excellent experience. I will definitely be back to this place many times. If you are in or around the area, stop by and make sure to give this place a try!

I visited The Deli again for the second time yesterday. The food was spectacular as on my first visit. The service again was amazing. For my review this time I wanted to focus on the ice cream. Holy freak! First, it is only $2 for a small ramekin. The ice cream is freshly created by the pastry chef, Nicole - there were some normal sounding options such as mint chocolate chip, but I wanted something different. I ordered the Red Chile honey ice cream and my friend chose the coconut, roasted peanut & chocolate chip ice cream. There was a lot going on with these dishes. The red Chile was smooth and creamy with a bit of a bite at the end. Loved it! The second dish had a good taste, but the texture was different - a little dry and crumbly...didn't stop me from eating it. Looking at the board I wanted to try the Fennel - so I ordered that. Nicole brought it out and said she wasn't happy with the texture of the coconut, so there wouldn't be a charge for this one. It was smooth and creamy as well - the fennel flavor hit at the end.   I really loved the unusual flavors and the fact that they were home made. I am only sad that it took me a while to find this place the first time and secondly that I am not eating there daily. This is one of the best places not only in QC, but Phoenix in general.

How have I not yelped this place yet? It is 1 of 3 places I go in the fabulous Queen Creek-San Tan Valley metroplex where my dining selection isn't handed to me from a drive-up window. I go here at least once a week. I am not typically a fan of salad, but upon further reflection, I think I am not a fan of salads I make at home. Actually I am not a fan of anything I make at home, hence, I eat out.   On the rare occasion I will enjoy a sandwich here, but typically it is just the salad. I was lured by the famous marketing slogan "limited time offer" and tried the tomato mozzarella sandwich. Just a half, on wheat.  It was good and the basil leaf inside gave it a strong bite of flavor. Tasty. Next, I was happy to see the return of my favorite salad from last year (also a limited time offer...) the summer berry blend..which really, why is it limited time? They have a side of fruit salad you can get any time. It is just a green salad with dressing and the fruit on top - but somehow magic is formed when they name it the summer berry blend and I am drawn to it instantly.   Speaking of sides that are excellent, go for the Key West Tuna. I know, tuna is a bit boring and I wouldn't go to a restaurant and order a tuna sandwich - that is a rare treat I can make at home without too much trouble. But I tried a "sample" of the Key West Tuna one day and wow! Incredible! It is mixed with shell pasta and very tasty. I have ordered a green salad with dressing and requested that added to the top (rather than the standard tuna salad they can make). Yum! The catch is the Key West tuna is only out on Saturday and Sunday...or maybe it is Friday and Saturday - go on Saturday and it is there for sure...  Of course you have to get a cookie. They are slap-ya-mama good. The famous chocolate chips are my favorite, but some of the others are not bad either. They usually have free samples on the counter. Give them all a shot!  Plus they have a great reward program - 10 meals and you get a free salad & drink combo. Easy to rack up the points here as much as I visit. The staff is always friendly and provides fast service. Definitely put it on your QC rotation.

The best part about Logan's is the rolls - and I don't mind that you do not need to add butter because it is already dripping with butter. YUM! I can taste a hint of beer in the roll as well...or it could just be yeast..or wishful thinking. I am trying to be healthier, so I went with the salad and water. The anything-and-everything salad does have some good items included - craisins, pecans, egg, grilled chicken and a good balsamic vinaigrette dressing...but still it was a salad. Maybe I should have ordered the grilled streak salad...but the peanuts are a free appetizer and you can throw them on the floor. What fun! The sweet tea is outstanding and reminds me of my days in Atlanta.  Another review commented about the similarity between Logan's and Texas Roadhouse. They are very similar, but I wouldn't say Logan's is a knock off. Plus Logan's was started in 1991 to Texas Roadhouse's 1993, so perhaps they are the ones being imitated?  Come in for a sweet tea, free peanuts and the excellent rolls. The rest is about your average steakhouse. Two salads, one tea and a water - $22.

This is a sweet place, and unexpected in the desert. I have been here in the past for paddle boating on the lake, concerts in the park and a few runs. This past weekend I ran the Frank Kush 5K - lots of people and their dogs, good weather and a nice gathering spot. The area has many portable bathrooms, picnic tables and even a baseball field. When someone from out of state visits, I often try to bring them here - especially if there is an event being held.

I stopped by this place for the first time. As Matt S. said, it is a small place - it used to be a hot dog restaurant that I tried just before moving to Queen Creek. I ordered as take out, so I can't comment on the service, but the staff was very friendly. I ordered the gyros value meal (comes with fries and a drink) for $7.50, a chicken ceasar pita combo and a hummus appetizer. The total was $23.  The hummus wasn't the best I have had (and I am only a recent fan), but it was good. The pita bread that came with the hummus was exceptional! Both meals were very good as well. Added bonus - the fries are crinkle cut fries, which is rare and a real treat! Yeah for the fries!  I will definitely be back and try something else from the restaurant.

I have been here several times and it is wonderful. To be honest I have never gotten past the lasagna - tons of cheese, good sauce and piled thick. This would be like my Mom would cook, if my Mom could cook. A nice place to hang out with a glass of wine and an good Italian. This restaurant has other locations - all in Illinois. Definitely give it a visit!

It is Oktoberfest and that means beer and sausage! I glanced over the menus, but stuck with the Oktoberfest menu and chose the 3 German sausage meal with braised red cabbage, sauerkraut mashed potatoes and 2 kinds of mustard with a half litre Festbier. My friend ordered the tomato grilled cheese (which was excellent) with garlic fries (tons of garlic) and a tomato bisque soup. The soup kind of sucked - it tasted like Ragu - too thick and tomatoey and not enough basil. The waitress was kind enough to swap it out for a most excellent lobster bisque (rich and a little thin, but great flavor).  The ad on the table tempted me throughout the meal with a brownie sundae. Talk about happy finish! Good googly-moogly!! The brownie was warm, dark and delicious. Top that with vanilla ice cream, some bailey Irish cream, caramel and chocolate sauce. Freak! It was worth the $6.95.  As a side note, I have also previously ordered the beer sampler - nice selection if you are unsure what house beer to order. Get them all!  The place is typically busy, but the staff has always fast and friendly. Good tip left for swapping the soup and keeping the drinks full.

Tonight I came with a group of people. One guy in the group did illegally sneak in a bottle of beer from another establishment in the San Tan Mall complex. He was quiet, but it was brought to the manager's attention. He came over and told the guy that he could not bring the drink in and needed to get rid of it. The guy said you mean drink it? The manager said you need to get rid of it, so they guy drinks it and hands the bottle over to the manager. No one else in the restaurant saw an issue, but the manager said he refused to service not only him but the entire party. Good for you - we went elsewhere.He could have told the guy not to drink the beer and taken the bottle, but the rest of the party wasn't doing anything out of line. The waitress was nice and it is unfortunate, but sometimes nice people suffer too. I did not bring a drink into the building but was refused service as well, so I have no interest in supporting your establishment any longer. Good luck surviving the recession.

A couple of coworkers and I recently visited Joyful Yoga to try the Saturday AM Zumba class. The studio was easy to find and conveniently located on Ray road in Chandler - good location that made it easy for friends coming from other parts of town to meet up.   The class was high-energy, as was the instructor Melinda. The class was packed, and even though I have taken zumba classes at other places, it was still a learning process with the instructors specific moves. The crowded classroom made it difficult to see her, but the positive aspect was she didn't stay up front, she moved around and checked on everyone. When I couldn't see her, I looked at the students in front of me and tried not to make a fool of myself.  The songs were a good mix of Latin, Hip/Hop, Bhangra and provided a great workout. One of my coworkers who had not previously experienced zumba stated she had never sweated so much in her life. Even with the frequency that I go at other places, it was a good workout for me as well. Good job, Melinda!  The classes are $10 per session, but I took advantage of a special that I saw while checking in on my mobile Yelp: two sessions for the price of one. We were planning on going two times, so that worked out perfectly.  The studio had a nice shop, some treadmills in the back and nice supply of matts, blocks and yoga supplies. If you are in the Chandler area, I would definitely recommend this studio.

This place just opened at this location in December and being that there are very few places in Queen Creek to eat, I thought I would give it a try. It is in a strip shopping center and the first thing to note is that it was crowded. Plenty of outside seating wraps around the business, but it was slightly chilly so I chose inside. Actually it was warmer outside. The next thing I noticed was the door said breakfast or lunch and one window promoted "meats" and french fries. There were several workers, so I figured it would be a quick service.   The table next to me had a couple that had already ordered and only had their drink. Eventually a lady walked up and asked if someone took their order and they said yes. Our order was taken  and other people arrived, which filled the room (seating is maximum 45). Later tthe couple left, only throwing a couple of bucks on the table. No food ever arrived. Someone asked about it and the waitress indicated they wanted lunch and the restaurant was only serving breakfast (at 11:30?) - and why no one told them it was breakfast only, I don't know. I noticed that the table across from me received their order. The little girl a large bowl of oatmeal, the wife something that was correct and the husband a large plate of pancakes and sausage. He informed the waitress that wasn't what he ordered. She took it back and returned a few minutes later with the correct food.   The waitress came to our table and gave us a bowl of "scones". It wasn't like any scone I have ever had. Two small cookie like items that were kind of sweet and tasted like the cookie part of a chocolate chip cookie (no chocolate). Next I hear the waitress delivering food to the table behind me (which came in after we did). Ironically, she called out the same things that I ordered - a breakfast burrito and a side of biscuits and gravy. Seems odd two tables would order that combo. She delivered another tables order and one of the patrons identified part of their order as incorrect. The guy behind me, after eating part of the burrito, realized that wasn't what he ordered. The waitress was called over and she also determined that should have been mine instead of his. She never came to my table to tell me about it or say it was coming - instead she called out to the kitchen she needed another one. Probably 15 minutes later mine arrived. My friends had still not come yet. The waitress looked at what she delivered and gave the biscuits and gravy to my friend. She said that  was mine - then the lady reversed them. I said no, those are both mine. The waitress turned to my friend and said "you didn't want anything?" She reminded her that she ordered a ham and cheese omlet with wheat toast. The waitress headed back to the kitchen and blamed them. 10 minutes later returned with the omlet - which looked like I made it. I can't cook, which is why I go out. It looked like folded over fried eggs with Kraft singles on the top. We reminded her about the wheat toast. Several minutes later and still no toast. I called her over and asked how the wheat toast was coming. She checked with the kitchen asking the exact same thing. Another 5 minutes and we had toast.  The service shouldn't have been slow because there were several workers. I can get by with slow service, but when there are 3 orders mixed up or arrive in courses and someone walks out, maybe that isn't the line of work for you. The food was just okay - when they say family restaurant just like home, that is no lie! It looked and tasted like I cooked it. Given my level of skill, I eat out a lot. I won't need to go back for a repeat visit any time soon.

Okay, so I tried this place again...This was one of my first Yelp reviews, I gave it a bad review and received hate mail in response. I had not been back...but decided to give it a second try today. There have been big improvements. The décor was nice, it looked like some newer tables with big, heavy chairs and I loved their sign and logo over the kitchen. Nice feel to the place. One concern I had was that it was not too busy for a Saturday morning.   The service was good . The waitress came out promptly, took the drink orders, gave enough time to look over the menu and took the order. I ordered chocolate milk (which to be honest was about room temperature and Hershey's Finest...). She indicated those cups were smaller than the regular cups, so if I wanted more, just ask.   I went with the bourbon French toast. She asked regular or crunch - and I wasn't sure what it implied, but I chose crunchy (I am decisive like that). I was expected two or three slices of bread - but what came out was six slices in a nice presentation. The crunch was a topping (kind of tasted like crunched up Frosted Flakes), I didn't taste any bourbon but the syrup was good. I had some pecans and a dash of whipped cream on top. I was not only pleasantly impressed, but I couldn't finish it. To top that off it came with two strips of super thick bacon. It wasn't crispy and overcooked, but it was firm and very tasty.  I have to say, good improvements to the menu, the service and the atmosphere to this place. I enjoyed the experience today and will give it another shot in the future.

I have lived in Queen Creek for a year and a half and have never noticed this restaurant. I never turn down the road that it is on, but drive past it every day. Wanting something Italian and learning Nick & Vito's closed, I remembered seeing a sign on Ellsworth point toward the restaurant. It was surprisingly close.  The first thing I noticed (other than the door slamming in the strong winds) was the size of the restaurant. Very large with a nice bar area, multiple televisions and a nice big glass window. Our server was prompt and stopped by frequently. He kept the drinks filled and ensured we had everything we need. The deco was nice too - a nice marble textured wall with some posters/paintings on display. I heard Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin lowly through the overhead speakers.  I was distracted in looking at the menu because I was trying to locate Yelp reviews on my phone to see what was good. The waiter had already stopped by twice allowing extra time and I still wasn't sure, so I just ordered fettuccini alfredo. My friend ordered basically the same thing plus chicken & broccoli. Both dishes came with salad. I have to say the bread was excellent. I know, kind of weird getting excited over bread, but that with the oil. Nice!  The portions were huge - I came away with a big take out box. Not bad for $10.95. Guess who's got lunch?  Overall the fettuccini was fine. It wasn't the best I have had, but it was good. The sauce was not too thick, not too runny. It was a good dining experience and a good, close option for Italian food in the Queen Creek area.

Despite the drama with a recent flight and encountering a gaggle of morons in Boston and JFK, the two ladies I worked with at the Delta baggage office in Sky Harbor were friendly, knowledgable and helpful. Karen F. called my cell phone as soon as my bag that had been missing for 4 days and traveling the world arrived. She held it in the office and explained what happened. The office also locks up the bags here, unlike Logan Airport which leaves them out for anyone to take.   When my other bag once lost, but now found was lost returning home, she was able to locate it within minutes. She provided a new claim ticket, indicated the bag would be delivered to my house the next day and if it wasn't there by a specific time, to call back. She also encourage me to call the corporate office and complain about the experience I had so far on the trip. When I mentioned my bag was lost for 4 days and I had to go buy clothes, she asked for the receipts. She wrote a reimbursement check for $500, which she said will be mailed to my home in 7-10 days.   She was able to listen to the problem, come up with solutions and be pleasant when the others in the earlier airports were just idiots.

A few weeks ago I stopped by the restaurant at the Bass Pro Shop and noticed Toby Keith's. It is across from a cigar store I want to try as well, so I decided to check it out sometime. Yesterday was that time. I arrived about 8:30 pm (Saturday) and the place was packed. I didn't plan on trying to food - just checking out the bar portion.   The place was huge! The bar was long, had several beers on tap, bottle of various alcohols and was well-staffed. And the people! It was not quite wall-to-wall, but it was very full and continued to get busier as the night went on. I ordered a beer on tap and was amused to see it arrive in a large mason jar. Too bad mason jars do not have handles, but it worked. It was $6 for the beer.   I am not a fan of country, but the place was cool. I know some of Toby Keith's songs, and they played a few. There was a band called Whiskey Drunk that performed. Good band with good songs, not too many slow songs, which was unfortunate for me. I am not familiar with the country dancing so when I did dance with someone it wasn't pretty. The impressive thing about the bar was that it attracted all types of people. You had your cowboys, people of all races and ages. Many bars only draw in the young crowd and the occasional creepy old man like me, but anyone would fit in here. There were plenty of 20 somethings, but there were just as many 30-somethings, 40somethings and 50 somethings. I also saw a couple probably well into their 60's hanging out and the lady was dancing and having a blast.  One of the downsides was limited seating. Plenty of spots around the bar and some tables scattered throughout, but with the number of people, I was standing where I always felt in the way. Maybe I am getting old, but it was a little loud too...there are bartenders that were doing various moves with shots and when they would, another person was blowing a whistle, the crowd went wild and they did whatever they were doing. I did see the bartender dim the lights juggle flaming bottles and blow fire. That was cool! I couldn't quite see down to the other end of the bar (that's how long it was), but I think there was another guy down there doing the same thing.  I might need to watch some CMT, but I will definitely go back. This place is hoping on the weekends for sure.

Okay, I know I previously reviewed that I do not like these places, but I am coming around. One of my coworkers taught me the ways of proper assembly and my opinion started to change.  Yogurtland is not too far from my office. They have a good selection and a price per ounce cheaper than MoJo. I sampled the green tea, the double cookie and cream, the red velvet cake batter, the pistachio - but my favorite was a combination of peanut butter and vanilla wafer. I think vanilla wafer is one of the best I have tried - and you can top it with vanilla wafers.  I am slowly being won over by FroYo, and this place is one of my favorites so far.

This was my second trip to Costa Vida. I went soon after it opened and was very impressed. It is more expensive than Chipotle, but it is worth it. The first time I had the sweet pork nachos and it was great.  The thing I like the most is watching them make the tortillas. They are made right there in front of you so you know they are fresh. The meats are good and the veggies fresh. The guacamole is excellent!  My trip today I decided to try one of the salads and I won't actually do that again. If it was just a normal salad with pork, chicken or steak on it I am sure it would be good - but I had to be all flashy and order the mango chicken. Yikes! It looked like La Choy Canned Vegetables from 1975 and it tasted like a failed variety of Fanta. I started off hungry but I couldn't even eat it - look at my picture and you will know what a miracle that is. I haven't missed many meals in my day. The scary thing is the server recommended that saying it was better than the raspberry chipotle salad. Guess which one I won't be trying in the future?   Definitely go to this place and check it out - but stick to the standards.

While walking down Mill and hungry for lunch, I stopped in Hippies Cove. Nice name...The decor was very nice - I felt right at home. Of course, I am from a small town in Ohio called Yellow Springs that was known for hippies and while living in Atlanta I frequently visited Little Five Points. This restaurant would fit in either location.  The place was of good size, but was mostly empty during lunch. I walked up to the counter and looked over the options, unsure how it worked. Then I noticed the menu on the left-hand wall. I went with the three tacos, carne asada. I added cheese, pico, sour cream and onions. It came with a side of chips with a very good salsa. Very quick service and good quality food. Add to that the nice decor - what's not to love?

What a pleasant surprise! I was headed to Serrano's, which I don't particularly enjoy, when I noticed the sign on a tucked away building in the same parking lot. I wasn't sure what the restaurant was or what to expect, but one thing I did know - I had not yet Yelped in (and I could also Check in via the new handy Yelp mobile feature)...  The owner saw my confused look and quickly concluded it was my first visit. Looking over the options for salads, sandwiches and wraps, I chose the Mediterranean vegetable wrap while my friend took the Mediterranean chicken sandwich. My wrap came with a spinach tortilla, hummus, olives, feta, onions, red peppers, pesto - you name it! The chicken sandwich was served on ciabatta and most of the same ingredients ('cept no hummus).   Looking over the menu I was excited to see they actually had bananas Foster! WHAT?!? Then the owner explained, no, that was a banana Foster gelato, not the actual banana Foster...and they no longer had gelato because the ice cream actually was a bigger seller. He did say that he could make a banana Foster-like milkshake with banana, ice cream, some caramel... it was good, and close, but not quiet there. We also left with a chocolate/peanut butter shake. That was tasty!  The owner said they have been open for 8 months and although it is tucked away, that is part of the charm because it isn't right up on the street. The entire side windows open during the warmer weather and a local music company sets up live music. They have a car show, a ride your bike day, etc. A few regular local events, paintings from local artists and the availability of a logoed shirt and hat (sold at cost) make this place a charming find in the QC. I will definitely put this on my list of places to stop by from time to time.

I like Paradise Bakery, but if you have been to multiple locations or ever the same location multiple times, you know it can be hit or miss depending on who is making the salad. This was the first time that the same person made salads and they were drastically different.  I met someone here for an early dinner/first date and spent time talking and getting to know each other. The restaurant was not busy and provided a good setting for a meeting. After about an hour, we made our way to the line and ordered salad.   The soup maven had to go in the back and fetch the salad lady. My date ordered Greek salad with no onions and no olives, but add chicken. The lady struggled with the successful completion of this challenging  order. She started to add onions until my friend stopped her - then she started to add the olives, again being foiled. She neglected to add the chicken until reminded. My friend's bowl was about half full when completed. She made her way down the line when the salad lady asked for my order. I stuck with an Asian chicken salad (no substitutions or alterations), but then she discovered no tongs - so into the back she went and emerged three minutes later. When completed, I had a heaping bowl of salad.   By this time my date already hit the register, paid for her own salad, picked up the drink and sat down to begin eating. Normally I would have paid for both meals, but the salad delay thwarted my chivalrous attempt... My check out was uneventful and I joined her at the table.  Another issue with the restaurant was the temperature. I can appreciate that this is Arizona and you need AC, but it isn't that hot out now. The temperature must have been set for the dog days of August in the Deep South. It was chilly and she was noticeable cold and shaking. That made for uncomfortable eating and conversation (I am sure it wasn't my company). She finished most of the salad and I maybe hit half before deciding to leave and head for warmer ground.   I know it is a small treat, but the signature item at Paradise Bakery is the chocolate chip cookie. It is a bakery after all. Try the 2 for 1 cookie, stuff your face with a few bites of each free sample or take home a dozen. They are definitely worth it and provide an excellent happy finish to an otherwise healthy meal.  A little more consistency on the salad portions, some fine tuning of the timeliness with the salad preparations and a reasonable temperature would have made the evening more enjoyable.

First, a positive note. They have significantly reduced the drive thru time, which used to be incredibly long. The food itself is fine in taste, but they need to appreciate the importance of attractive food presentation. I go there because of the boxed meal. It packs a good portion of food in a small, reasonably priced area. I love a box! The Taco Bell Big Box Meal, the Taco Bell Volcano Box Meal...it doesn't have to just be Taco Bell - Long John Silvers Snack Box, the KFC Guitar Hero Box... chances are, if its a box, I am going to eat it. So imagine my disappointment when the box meal comes in a bag. The server indicated they were out of boxes. This isn't the first time I have ordered from this location and went home box-less. It should be a simple analysis of sales, projection of sustainable demand and the appropriate number of boxes ordered. How difficult is that? Even worse, I get home with my Volcano Bag Meal and the volcano taco is busted in three places. It is more or less a volcano taco salad. The second taco was a regular taco and it was broken along the bottom - so one bite and the contents were on the paper. What are they doing back there with the tacos?  The cinnamon twists were fine and so was the volcano burrito - then again its more difficult to break a burrito...So Taco Bell, let's get the presentation down. If you are going to advertise a box, give me a box.

This place is fairly new and to be honest, I didn't know it was there until I saw one of those ads before the movies at Harkins. I Googled it after seeing the commercial and most people said it was difficult to find. Here's where it is - go to Power Road and it is in the complex with Uncle Bears and LA Fitness. I arrived Tuesday night at 5:30. Maybe it was too early for dinner, but the place looked closed. There were no cars in the lot and the windows were dark. As it turned out, it was open - but we were the only guests at the time. Eventually three more tables showed up.  The place is called Trophy's because the decor features animals shot by the owner. It features what is called the North American 29. I forgot to bring my camera phone, but there was a polar bear, musk ox, bison, many types of deer and sheep as well as 5 bears. The interior was spacious and great seating. There were more employees that customers, so the service was excellent. I had Gerardo and he attended to our every need.   The menu features steak, pasta and chicken primarily, but there are also a few choices of game. I went with today's special - the flatiron steak with wild boar ribs, green beans and sweet potato fries. Excellent! My friend had the elk & buffalo meatloaf. Another fine selection! We ordered a salad, and it was huge, not to mention tasty. The bread was excellent! Gerardo indicated that with the dinner we also could have the soup, which was a chicken noodle with wild rice. I was not disappointed - and for desert a nice chocolate brown with ice cream (and one strawberry).  If you like the more exotic game, it is best to go on the weekend. Gerardo said last weekend they had the wild boar ribs and in the past few weeks they had kangaroo, antelope sausage, llama and coming up this weekend pheasant. Also they receive types of fish such as Tuna and trout.   If you don't like your animals mounted and watching you, this may not be to your liking - but that didn't bother me and I liked looking at the displays. Dinner for 2 with salad, drinks and dessert is about $50.- but the food is some of the best in the area and the service was second to none. This place is great and needs some people to give it a try!

Let me just say YUCK. Papago's Café is located in the Papago Buttes Corporate Plaza, which is the building in which I work. I go because it is convenient. The food is overpriced and under-whelming. When you consider a breakfast burrito is about $6 and I can walk across to Filberto's for half of that price, it isn't a good option. But often I don't bring my lunch and I am lazy.   Aside from being overpriced, the food quality is sub par. They do some things well like the pasta station and I do like the overpriced breakfast burritos. If you go and order anything, make sure it is grilled so that it will kill any creepy-crawlies that might otherwise be present. Pre-packaged is also a good choice. For God's sake don't try the salad bar. There have been cockroaches present in the salad bar as well as the ice machine. Don't take my word for it, you can see on the August 23 edition of Dirty Dining that the café has had multiple health inspection violations (http://www.kpho.com/news/13966840/detail.html). I think my favorite comments were one visit where the inspectors discovered cockroaches in the mop room (http://www2.ahwatukee.com/page/restaurant_inspections/report/100470). The next visit it indicated the mop room had holes in the wall big enough to let a small cat through (http://www2.ahwatukee.com/page/restaurant_inspections/report/100468). Well naturally...how else can you get rid of the cockroaches? And maybe it's just me, but the word "infestation" is never a good inclusion in a health inspection report. "Mice droppings" usually are a bad sign as well (http://www2.ahwatukee.com/page/restaurant_inspections/report/100466).  Be afraid...be very afraid...

This is a great establishment with a wide craft beer selection in the East Valley. I have had food a couple of times, but usually I just go for drinks. Nice large, rotating selection of beers on tap and some good bottles. No carry-out license so if you do get a bigger bottle you have to drink it there.

I have been much more active over the past nine months between half marathon training, multiple weekly zumba sessions, and the occasional yoga class - just after just two sessions with Pete at Glove Game Boxing, I have had my ass handed to me. I purchased a Groupon for 10 sessions. These are 1:1 sessions with a trainer, 30 minutes each. It is amazing how challenging 30 minutes seems when going through the drills.  Jumping rope, medicine ball, 3 push-up positions, sit-ups, dips - and that's the warm up. Strap on the hand wraps, slip on the boxing gloves and it is time to hit the ring. Jab, cross, upper cut and hook - punching the trainer's hands, working the heavy bag, ducking punches. Whew.  I am tired just typing it. After a session my arms are jello and a water bottle is difficult to lift.   The gym is located on the top floor in the same building at FnB, Cowboy Ciou, and Lee's Cream Liqueur.  Typically each session is $20 - you will definitely get a workout!

Ebony K. warned me...but I think those waffles are starting to chin check me.  To welcome a new member to my team at work we went to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles. I was excited because I have seen many positive reviews. The prior reviews were on the money. This is one of the best places I have been to in town, on da rilla.  I ordered the very manly Betty Boop...which claimed "one juicy breast and a waffle" to that I added a side of cheese grits. Having lived in the ATL, I had to order the sweet tea - but red kool-aid on the menu? I ain't mad atcha!  I am somewhat of a sweet tea snob, but this tea was perfect. The restaurant was full with a small line waiting, but despite the traffic the order arrived quickly. Shots out to our waitress, Didi. We had five in our group and of course no one carried cash. The back of the menu says 18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more, no separate checks and no more than 2 transactions per table for parties of 5 or more. She made an exception and we each ordered individually.   The waffles were bigger than I expected. A coworker mentioned they were thin, so I mistakenly assumed small. Not so. The waffle and the chicken were very filling. I thought the fried chicken was juicy with good flavor and the waffle was excellent. I could have lived without the cheese grits, but I had to order them. I haven't had grits too often here in the desert. This meal magically transported me back to my days in the ATL. They also sell t-shirts for $20 with a variety of ghetto slang. Before leaving I had to pick up the "Barnyard Pimp" shirt. Thaswutsup.   I will definitely be back to this place! Lolo's is off the heezy fo sheezy!

I have been trying to actually hit the gym and get into better shape lately. One Stop Nutrition opened last July and have a good location right in the plaza with LA Fitness. The store is large with bright lights and wide aisles. It is always clean. Each time I have visited the same lady is working and she is very helpful. There are many products to fit various needs. Typically I stop in for a post-workout protein shake. Give it a shot.

After a few down days, it was time to get my mind off things with a little shopping. Nothing like Men's Wearhouse to do the trick - a full range of clothes - suits, button down shirts, polos, business casual - even jeans and graphic tees. The staff is always friendly and knowledgable. They know what looks good and will select clothes for you based on your preference and their suggestions. Wardrobe Consultant Ray Probst has helped me a couple of times and he has done a great job each time. One thing I like is they have a wide selection of styles and sizes. They will measure you and I have used their tailor services for a couple of tuxedos I purchased elsewhere.  The company has a great web site with a larger selection than the store and sometimes a lower price. Another cool thing for about $100 per month is the fresh shirt and tie club  - a new shirt and tie based on the recommendations each month in your mail box. Free shipping and right to the door.  I need to step it up and visit the store more often to switch the game a bit. Men's Wearhouse - the official store of Vanilla Heat 2.0...

Simply worthless! Where do I even begin? If you look at the 2000 US Census and see Queen Creek with a population of 4316 and again in 2006 with a population of 20,818, the rational person might think if these folks want to mail letters, we might need more than 2 representatives at a time and maybe stay open longer than 12-2 on Saturday. My trip today took 37 minutes waiting in line...  The building is small and unnoticeable unless you are looking for it - then they have weird hours, especially the 2 hour Saturday operation. Here's a quick clue- if you can find a parking spot, they are closed. I showed up today at 11:30 and rejoiced at the ability to find a parking spot. See above...they were closed. I left and ran some errands in the area, returning at 12:10 - just 10 minutes past opening. As I walked in the door, I noted the lobby was full and it wrapped down the hall way and turned down another hall. Really? That many people in just a few minutes? Of course there were only 2 workers, so that helped the delay. While continuing with negative thoughts in my mind and watching the unsupervised children running around, screaming and playing with the PO Boxes while the mom didn't care. My only source of amusement while waiting in a line of more than 50 people was the number of people who came in after me. I counted 5 who walked in, looked around and said "Jesus!"...others looked forward to the October day when the new post office opens.   Besides the operation hours, the constant line of people regardless of the time and the horrible parking situation is the limited supplies. If they are closed, you would think there would be a nice stash of labels, envelopes and forms in the outside lobby so that customers could complete their mailing ahead of time. That would speed up the line. No. The only thing in the lobby was a stack of fliers promoting the upcoming appearance of Phil Vasser at the performing arts center. That was the reason I had an errand to run - I needed to buy an envelope so I could complete the mailing. Otherwise there is a tricky traffic jam between the people holding the door open, then releasing to let people out, only to grab it again...and the people coming in needing supplies. They walk inside to locate the envelope and labels while the rest of the lobby stares them down to make sure they do not cut in front of the massive line.  Combine this with the mail delivery that sucks - wrong address, inconsistent times - just general suck-ass-iness...  This place and its service just plain sucks. Glad I do not mail many items, but I will be glad when the new facility opens. Hopefully it is better!

The best aspect of Panchero's was the tortilla. It is in dough form and grilled right before your eyes on the tortilla press. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was among the best I have had anywhere. Fresh off the grill, they asked what salsa I wanted - I went with the medium and the corn - but unfortunately for a quesadilla, it is already grilled shut - so you either have to reopen it or eat it separately like a side dish.   The owner was not only there when I visited, but he was working the grill, busing the tables and checking customer satisfaction. Big props for that!   The only other thing I didn't like was the size of the tables. There were two of us for lunch and the tables were really small. It felt crowded and I didn't like that - but the food and the service was excellent. I will definitely return.

One of my biggest pet peeves is stupidity - and fewer things frequently showcase the talent of stupidity better than a drive thru window. The only thing I can combat stupidity with is being a smart ass.   The menu board indicates #8 to be a "Jumbo Jack with Cheese"...I approached the speaker box and ordered a number 8. The voice returns "Do you want cheese on that?"...I replied "would I like cheese on my jumbo jack with cheese? Yes, I think I will enjoy cheese on my jumbo jack with cheese tonight..."  Trying to order the number with lettuce, tomatoe and pickle only proved challening as the voice kept interrupting with what size? what to drink? Fries?...before I could give the specifics. Despite the challenges, the food arrived accurrately and I don't think they did anything unusual to it in the back...

Located around the state capitol, this park serves as a memorial for fallen officers and vets. Multiple statues and memorials, as well as a large community green area around Jefferson & 17th.   The park also serves as a local running course for many events such as the Run to Remember, the Phoenix 10K and the start of the PF Chang marathon/half marathon. The course is fast and flat and makes for a good running experience through the streets to Phoenix. The above mentioned green space allows tired runners a nice spot to relax and refresh.

I met up with some coworkers for a happy hour, and even though I used to live at Dobson & Warner, I hadn't previously ventured to the Sandbar. I arrived early just after the start of happy hour and had no trouble finding a parking spot or a nice table on the patio - across from the fire pit, in the sand, near an umbrella. Perfect.   During happy hour they had $2.50 Dos Ambers and $4 frozen marguerites. I started with both. The waitress was cool and took excellent care of me all evening - can't remember her name, but the ticket read "Smiles". The drinks kept coming, as did the friends, and just a couple of raindrops too. It was an excellent bar for people watching and everyone was friendly.  With the beer, the sand, the reggae it was a very good time. It was my first time there, but I will definitely be back.

Damn, I feel like a fat pig. That might be the only meal I need today! Being a nice weather, Friday kind of day I headed to the ASU campus to give the newly opened Smashburger a try. I have no prior Smashburger experience, but it was a new place to Yelp and I love me a burger.  I drove, and parking is a bit tricky if you do not want to pay for the parking garage. Fortunately I found a spot down the street in the 25 cents per 10 minute parking meters. The restaurant is in a good location -  plenty of traffic from foot, car and bus. Being right off campus I am sure it will be a big hit with students. Once inside, I found the restaurant small and cramped. The line was to the door (probably being new, being Friday and being noon didn't help). I placed an eat-in order and waited by a large table with several people gathered around. Looking around, all tables were full. Counting the large table, there were only 11 tables inside and a bar that seated 3 in the back. Glancing outside, the patio seating was full as well.   I ordered the Arizona smashburger - which comes in 1/3 lb or  1/2 pound sizes. The 1/3 pound is $5.99 while the larger size is just a dollar more, so I went large. The burger comes with habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipotle mayo, jalapenos and a chipotle bun. I could taste the guacamole, but the most noticable taste for me was the strong onions. The jalapenos were not noticeable.  I also ordered the smashfries which as small, thin fries seasoned with rosemary, olive oil, garlic and "other herbs"...Safe to say no one is kissing me immediately after eating this meal.  After placing my order and waiting at the table for it to arrive, I then had to wait for a table to open up. It might take a bit of waiting to get seated, so be prepared. If you go with more than one person, it would be best to collect the orders and have one person scout for a table.   You definitely need two hands and a stack of napkins for this monster! Honestly it was difficult to wrangle - meat sticking out of the bun in all directions, guacamole sliding out, slippery tomatos and the mayo made for one messy sandwich - but I pushed through and eventually got a good grasp on the beast. I think it may be the best burger I have ever purchased. I would put it up against any backyard burger I have had in my day. The fries were simply amazing! I love rosemary and the combination of ingredients was unique and flavorful.   Another aspect of the restaurant was that it was a little loud. Most likely not a good spot to go if you want to meet and get to know someone through introductory conversation...then again the oozing of quacamole down the face probably wouldn't make a good first impression either...  All totalled, with burger  ($6.99), fries ($1.79 with sandwich purchase) and drink ($1.69) came in with tax at $11.39. A little higher than a standard fast food burger, but 10 times the taste! If you are not into burgers, they have chicken, salads and hot dogs to choose from. If you don't want one of the standard 5 burgers, you can create your own. Definitely a good option...  If you want a good burger experience, give a Smashburger (and Smashfries!) a try!!

I planned to attand an event in Scottsdale at 6, but the problem is I get off work at 3. What to do to kill time? I wanted to find a nearby bar or restaurant to spend a couple of hours. Taste of Tops was recommended me, and having never been there I sought advice from the Yelp Mobile Duke of the Taste of Tops. George L. recommended that I partake in the Stone Saison du Buff that Tops currently has on tap.   Saison du BUFF is a joint venture between Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, Stone Brewing Co., and Victory Brewing.  The BUFF comes from the acronym Brewers United for Freedom of Flavor - a organization the three brewers formed in 2003, and apparently to press release information saw a last meeting held also in 2003. Freedom of Flavor was definitely achieved with this product. A 6% alchohol per volume craft beer brewed with parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. A pale beer with great flavor and nice finish.  The bar was empty (except for me and the bartender). Heavy traffic typically picks up after 8 during the weekdays and is busy on the weekends. Being there alone had its advantages - when the Dominos pizza guy dropped by and said someone cancelled their order and asked if they wanted the pizzas, who got a free slice of pepperoni? This guy! When the wine guy came by to peddle a couple of bottles of Spanish wine and a rather nasty bottle from Chile, who had a free impromtu wine tasting? This guy! To top the evening off I had a sample of mead. The sample was very sweet with a honey flavor and was excellent - I don't know if they ran out, but when I ordered a glass, I received a more hoppy variety. The bartender indicated it was one of her favorites and a new drinking partner arriving to the bar indicated he liked it as well. I found the flavor to be more of a mixture of ass and mead. Not my favorite!  All in all, an excellent afternoon with a rare limited release craft beer, some free pizza and tasty mead. Thanks George for the recommendation!

Originally introduced to this bar via the Tempe Beerathon and most recently Road Runner Sports Third Thursday run, I have also stopped here a few times for a drink. This is becoming a favorite place of mine to hang out after work when I am looking for a quiet happy hour. If I am not going with a group of people and just want to hang alone or with another person, this spot is an excellent sports bar, has great happy hour prices, and good food.   I have had the street tacos before - one night of the week they are $1. Small, but tasty. During happy hour 4-7 drinks are half price as is the food. I had the wings and while the hot had an underlying spicy flavor, they also seemed to be somewhat sweet. Either way they were good. I have also had chips and salsa before  - the chips are fresh and immediately out of the cooker and the salsa is spicy. They do have $1 pints, but I am confused when that happens. I thought it was 4-7, but it might have been until 4. When I received my bill my first 2 were $1, then others were $2. Still a good price.  Oh, and I have to say - the staff at the Devil's Advocate is the hottest in town.

Located in the Fry's shopping plaza just down from Dance Matrix, China Chef is where I order Chinese from in Queen Creek. The quality of the food is excellent and the wait time is short. I have always phoned in and picked up the order, although there are seats available if you choose to eat in the restaurant.   I am basically a creature of habit and always order the same thing - General Tso (comes with rice & egg roll) and a small hot & sour soup. The combo dinner is $7 and the soup is $1.50. I typically finish the soup, but can only make it through half of the entree. Save it for a follow-up lunch and it is economical for 2 meals. The service and food quality has never let me down and I will continue to make this my primary choice in Queen Creek.

Clear communication is an integral component of every relationship throughout life. For a business, a lack of communication can create many issues including alienating your customer base. Government agencies are unique in that when we do not receive adequate service we cannot simply go to a competitor. The Department of Revenue exemplifies poor communication resulting in poor customer service.   On a positive note, the list of individuals I spoke with today were friendly and able to each provide some type of information that helped the mysterious puzzle begin to take shape; however, several calls and valuable work time could have been avoided if clear communication were to take place. It is the old adage of one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing.   Over the weekend I received a letter labeled "accounts receivable demand notice" - sounds scary, but more interesting was the fact that I have never received prior communication indicating anything was afoot. There was no explanation, no contact person - only a summarized account balance showing penalties and interest for some unknown event occurring four years ago.   The first lead was the bolden invitation to visit them on the web, to which the corresponding web site address was unable to provide an further information. On the back of the statement read the message "if you do not agree with the balance or need further explanation, please call..". I called the number and spoke with a lady asking for the agent's name and other information I did not have. No worries - I provided my taxpayer ID and she was able to provide the agent's name and phone number. She said she would connect me, but for my information the agent's number was...and as she gave the number she mumbled the last 2 digits. I said excuse me, but I didn't get...too late - I was patched through to the agent's voice mail. The message stated I needed to leave a string of information including my UTI number. I don't know what that is, but I don't think I have it on this form... Still being friendly as not to upset "the man" I provided my name and contact information then indicated I had not received a prior letter nor did I have a UTI number, but I did have my taxpayer ID. I clearly stated that I also did not receive the full phone number and requested a return call. Within a few minutes my phone silently vibrated without catching my attention. The agent left a voice mail stating my call was being returned and to please call back. The agent did not leave the office number and the caller ID showed Blocked. Again, I had to return to the general office number and work back to the agent.   When I finally reached the agent, I received information as to what generated the letter, what was needed and why it occurred. The agent stated I should next call the collections number or I could set up something on the department web site. But even if I did the web site, I should cal the number to prevent them from taking it further. I chose phone call. In calling the collections department the person answering the phone asked the same questions and suggested I contact the agent. When I indicated that I had already spoken to the agent and it was suggested I phone collections, the representative was puzzled why the agent would send me to them. I was told that the issue was coded to auditing and should contact them to really get it resolved, but since auditing told me to call collections, maybe they could set it up on their end. My information was taken including name, address, SSN, employer, bank, etc. I indicating I would pay half of the bill this month and the other half next month. I asked if I would be sent a bill. I was told probably not - but I could phone in each time and pay over the phone.   While each person was friendly and had at least a piece of the puzzle (which is the reason for the second star), the entire ordeal took longer than an hour and would have continued to run in loops. The agent suggesting I contact the collections department to avoid further issues and collections suggesting I contact the agent to prevent further issues shows how well they have the run around game down to a science. Maybe it would be too easy for one person to field the call, give an explanation and take the steps to resolve the issue. Oh, you want to pay? Let me set that up for you. Thanks! I guess three different offices and tossing people back and forth is a way to ensure job security.

I can't comment on the cleanliness of the locker room.  When I go in I keep my head down and try not to dilly-dally in there too long. For some reason all the guys that are too big in some areas and too small in others like to walk around nekked for extended periods of time. It's best not too spend much time there.  I do agree with the first reviewer that the front desk personnel typically do not talk when taking your card. Usually there are multiple people behind the counter and they do talk, but only to each other. I did hire a personal trainer for a few months and I wasn't too happy with him. The manager was cool and the trainer I had the first time was cool, but my regular guy didn't do anything with me I wasn't doing on my own - and it was costing me $160 per month to do that, plus the $25 gym fee.  I do like the group classes. I have hit the spin class a few times and I like the Latin Impact class they offer, which is Zumba, but they didn't pay for the rights to call it Zumba. Must just be that location because other LA Fitness locations do have Zumba on the schedule. Either way, it's fun and the two instructors are good.   I have experienced some slipping with a couple of treadmills, but most of the other machines are operational. I have seen workers cleaning them, so while I am not sure how often, I do know they do clean them.  When I come already dressed, hit the treadmill and a group class, I find the experience good. I would have liked the training better with the first guy, but overall I think it was a little pricey.

I was driving home and thinking hey, it's Friday, it's afternoon and it's a holiday weekend - where can I go? The Yelp mobile app said Fat Willy's was close by and like Toucan Sam, I followed my nose...or at least my iPhone.  The bar had plenty of spacing and I was impressed with the layout when I entered. The bar had several seats and there were multiple televisions directly behind the bar as well as each side. There were a few guys at the bar, just hanging out with a friend or two and enjoying a few brews and sports. They all seemed to know the place and it was a good atmosphere. The bartender was cool and asked me what I wanted to drink, as well as ran down the happy hour prices. $4 for a large beer sounded good. I went with the Coastal Wheat. The glass was a monster - I asked a lady there how big the classes were and she said 25 oz - but I swear it was bigger (guys always think it's bigger)....  But I digress...$4 for the monster beer and $4 for a 10 piece wings. I ordered the 'hot" and to be honest, it wasn't that hot. They had a good flavor and came with blue cheese...After I nearly completed my second beer I decided to visit the men's room. When I turned around, I was again surprised. I thought it was just the bar and the room, and that the restroom was around the corner - no - there was a long hallway with more seating, and I noticed outdoor seating. I finally made it to the bathroom - Hello, Elvis on the door. When I returned, I asked what the draught beer on the end was - the bartender indicated it was a yet to be named amber beer. He said a contest will be had to name it and offered a taste in the cutest little mug. I tasted it and well, it didn't blow my skirt up. I would name it ho-hum, but that's just me. This time I went cheap and hit the $3 Miller Lite in the same 25oz mug. Nice!  All in all, it was a good adventure to Fat Willy's - and what a name :-) This would definitely be a place I would be a repeat offender at if I lived closer. Tons of space and televisions, good happy hour prices and a nice, attentative wait staff.

I really enjoy making the drive out here from Mesa. When I have out of town visitors and after I couple of days they get tired of the seeing desert-khaki hell we call home I drive them out to show that we have some nice views. Tortilla Flats is a stop along the Apache Trail and basically just four buildings: a store that has some touristy items, turquoise jewelry, purses, and also sells the Tonto Pass for those going back to the lake. The bar is nice - I had pancakes there one morning and they were huge. The general store has a good selection of ice cream. I had the prickly pear and a bottle of sarsaparilla. The final building is the small museum. In the past I never had cell reception, but my most recent trip I was able to pick it up. It is a short drive from Mesa but a completely different landscape along the way. Everyone I have brought from out of town was surprised to see the lake, the beautiful cacti, and the nice rocky landscape.

I read Matt S.' review and decided to stop by on my day off. His reviews have never steered me wrong. Once again, right on the money. I stopped in for lunch and was surprised to see a several people there mid-day on a Tuesday. The menu proclaims Golden Harvest as Queen Creek's best Chinese food. After my initial visit, I cannot disagree.  When I try a new place, I always order the same plate. For Chinese restaurants it is the General Tso. This has got to be the best General Tso I have ever had. It was crispy, but not crunchy. The chicken was tender and not overcooked. A perfect amount of sauce, rice and broccoli. All for $8.95. The portion was big enough for 2 portions (3 portions if I properly listened to Dr. Gupta).  Definitely give this place a shot. It definitely is Queen Creek's best Chinese.

I joined a meetup group that was meeting here, and while that didn't go so well, I had a great time at Down Under. I arrived late and it appeared everyone from the group was already together and there were no other seats, so I took a spot at the bar and enjoyed the tasting alone.  The tasting was $20 and included 5 wines plus an appetizer. I went with the mini kangaroo loin salad, because let's face it, how often do you get to eat a kangaroo? The salad was very good and I enjoyed all of the wines. The white "Y" Viognier 08 was my favorite until I tried the MGS 06 (although I didn't have a bad one in the bunch).  The evening turned out well as one of my friends stopped by for a few minutes and I was able to strike up a nice conversation at the bar with another lady. The restaurant was busy and there was a singer that helped pack in the customers. She was very good - not too loud, good tunes and a nice voice.   As it approached `10 I noticed more and more people leaving . I asked one of the guys what time they closed and he said whenever the last paying customer leaves. They do not have set times to close because as long as people are having a good time and still buying things, they will stay open. I met Phil, the owner, and he was an excellent host.   I always saw Susana check in here, but never tried it. I am glad that I went out today and met some people, even if it wasn't the people I was supposed to meet. I will definitely come back! Maybe next time I will try the emu wings  - and I saw someone get an incredible looking huge piece of chocolate cake - I must try that!

Living in Georgia, I was a huge fan of Regal Cinemas and disappointed there were no locations in Arizona. I enjoyed their loyalty card more so than AMC. Since living in AZ I have found Harkins to be a suitable replacement. They do not have the loyalty card, which earned free drinks, pop corn and movie tickets, but they do have the loyalty cup for $5 per year and the t-shirt for $20 per year. I don't receive free movies, but I do get $1 soda and free popcorn, which makes up for lack of a card.  This theater is conveniently located at the San Tan Mall - which means lots of shopping and restaurant choices pre & post movie experience. It is right off the Loop 202, which makes getting to it easy, and it is still fairly new. It is always clean, has friendly and helpful staff and provides a good movie experience.   Go in the morning on the weekend and it is rarely crowded. Christmas weekend was a huge box office tally for Hollywood with over $275 million - I saw a movie Christmas Day, Friday and Saturday without being cramped, herded like cattle through the concession stand or sitting in the front row looking at 40 foot actor heads.   There are only two movie theaters in the Queen Creek/Gilbert area - this one I like better than the one on Gilbert Rd.

This was my first time running Las Vegas and it was great. The Rock n Roll people are well organized and have all of the details worked out. The course is always well marked and aid stations in good locations.   The course for the half marathon was Mandalay Bay out to Freemont Street and back. I had completed five half marathons prior to this, but had not actually trained until now. The course was excellent and I enjoyed running down the strip - it just goes to show how deceiving Vegas is when you are out walking the strip. Granted, most people don't walk to Freemont, but just walking the strip and back is a good distance. You get sucked in by the buildings and next thing you know, turn around and your hotel is miles away. So it was fun that it was a half marathon and the distance was expected :-)   The post race concert rocked. Bret Michaels sounded good, the crowd was huge and it was a good time. Speaking of good times - the course was flat and fast. I was pleased to set my best times at 5K, 10K, 10 miles and a PR in the half marathon.   The weather was great, the crowds were great and I am glad that I could mark Nevada off my 50 state half marathon club punchlist - and complete my second Rock n Roll event in 2010. Good job, Las Vegas!

I was excited to see Dunkin' Donuts when it arrived in Queen Creek. There haven't been many in Arizona, but I have always enjoyed their coffee. Good to see they are expanding as now a second QC location opened last week. I visit New England every fall and Dunkin' Donuts are on nearly every corner there like Waffle Houses in Atlanta. Much like never ordering a waffle at the Waffle House, I rarely order a donut from Dunkin' Donuts. I typically go for the number 6 - coffee and plain bagel with plain cream cheese. How can you write a review on a plain bagel with plain cream cheese? I know, right? My review focuses mainly on the service and drive thru experience.  Joel L. once warned I was sailing in dangerous waters when commenting on the apparent level of competence I observed in the Jack in the Box drive thru. The lack of proficiency is not limited to Jack. I dare say that most drive thru windows in the QC suffer from the safe level of service. It is partly the order taker, partly the crappy speaker system and frequently the customer. Just order a number. That's why its there. If you have a complicated order and sheets of multiple orders, park the car and go inside...The combination of the three creates negative experiences in most drive thru dining opportunities. Here is one that breaks the mold. I cannot estimate the number of times I have driven through Dunkin' Donuts on my morning commute and placed an order for the old standby number 6.  Each time the line has been short, the voice on the other end pleasant and understandable. My order is never messed up like many places in town always seem to do. When I reach the window, the attendant is ready, hands me the coffee while I hand her my card. Only a few seconds later, a second person walks to the window, hands the bag with the toasted bagel and the cashier is back with my card. My typical time at the window is 30 seconds or less. They strive to provide timely service - not like Taco Bell who has the 60 second timer and simply ignores it when the allotted time is exceeded (maybe because it is always exceeded?) Dunkin' is a fast, efficient and accurate experience that other establishments should learn from.   At $3.79 for a toasted bagel with cream cheese, and extra large cup of some of the best coffee in the business and a fast and efficient drive thru experience, how can you go wrong?

I had not previously been to the Fairmont Princess for lodging or dining, although I have been a guest and a big fan of three Fairmont properties in Alberta, Canada. Located just off the Scottsdale Road & 101 exit the property was easy to find. I reserved the Valentine's Dinner based on the menu I saw online. The menu showed a four-course meal of Lobster and Cauliflower Bisque & Scallops, Wild Striped Bass with English Pea Ravioli, Bone-In Cowboy Steak with Maine Lobster Mac & Cheese and a Brussels Sprouts, Bacon Marmalade, then finally Raspberry Lemongrass Cheesecake for $85 per person.   The server was friendly and informative. We began with complimentary chips & salsa and each ordered a margarita (she the Organic Agave Nectar margarita and me the El Pina Diablo, a pineapple~serrano chile infused tequila). The server brought out the first course, which the menu on the table showed as Sopa de Calabaza. It was a roasted butternut squash soup with crispy pork belly, chipotle yogurt crema and a Granny Smith apple. There was a drizzle of chili oil on top. It was good, although I was a little puzzled it was not the lobster bisque. The granny smith apples were small strips at the bottom of the soup and I could not determine what they were - so I had to ask.   The second course arrived and again I had to ask what it was because it wasn't the wild bass and ravioli I was thinking it would be. Instead it was Empanadas de Langosta y Camaron; a pair of small lobster and shrimp empanadas with a black bean puree, chile arbol and a watercress with an oil and vinegar dressing. By this time I was already feeling the food wall fast approaching and realized we had the main course and dessert yet to come. I was glad that being a guy it didn't take long to get ready so I was able to run a couple of miles before preparing for the evening.  Course three prompted the server to ask how we liked our filet cooked. So this must be the bone-in cowboy steak with mac & cheese...no, it was Filete a la Parilla - grilled filet mignon, sweet corn and rajas tamal, crab fondue, roasted mushrooms and an Oaxacan chile demi. Again, another excellent dish, but not what I originally expected. By this time we were both so full that we barely ate this course. We each made a weak attempt at starting on the filete, but neither came close to finishing, and we both left the tamale. We brought them home in a nice looking take-out bag.  Even though we couldn't eat course 3 that was no excuse not to push on to course 4. It was not the raspberry lemongrass cheesecake, but instead an Almond Leche Flan de Fresas, which was an  almond custard with caramelized strawberries and a few strawberries & black berries on the size with a strawberry drizzle. As a gift my girlfriend received a complimentary red rose.  The meal was excellent and my girlfriend said it was the best meal she ever had. She loved the rose, the atmosphere of the restaurant and courtyard. It was chilly so the fireplaces were nice and inviting. The price was a little better than shown on the web site; $75 instead of $85. In researching the Valentine's Day menu it was surprising to see that the menu and cost described in the opening paragraph is what was shown on the restaurant's website  (http://www.scottsdaleprincess.com/var/cdev_base/storage/original/application/bd42c11d30ed3a90e0baaf090772bb6f.pdf), while the $75 and menu that was actually what we received was shown on a different party's web site (http://intheknowhotels.com/valentines-day-ideas-the-fairmont-scottsdale-princess-resort-packages). Typically I would expect the hotel and its restaurant to be a more reliable source. Despite the differences, the meal was perfect, my girlfriend had an excellent time, and we enjoyed our first official Valentine's Day together. I would definitely go back and try some of the other items. They have a good happy hour menu where the El Pine Diablo is $5 rather than the $11.50 tonight, and there is a $10 heirloom tomato salad that caught my eye.

Amazingly fast. I arrived prior to opening  and expected a long wait based on experiences with other labs in the past. This is a one-woman operation: she takes the paper work, the payment, walks the patient back, draws the blood and closes the visit out. It was much faster than I imagined given the one person staff, but even with two people ahead of me, I was in and out in less than 15 minutes. She indicated that she has been there for approximately 9 months and people and still just discovering her (like I did)...if you need lab work and don't want to wait in long lines, give this location a try.

I saw this on an episode of Diners, Drive thrus, and Dives. The seating and parking are very limited, but we were lucky enough to find a table big enough for the four of us. Our order did take much longer than expected because they were out of tortillas for an enchilada my wife ordered - so they made it from scratch. When it arrived it was magnificent. I ordered three tacos including a Oaxaca Black Mole Taco. That was one of the most incredible tacos I have ever had. I have had mole before and wasn't a big fan, but this was fantastic. The salsa bar was good, the chips and salsa excellent, and the horchata was the best I have ever had. I would certainly go here every opportunity I had.

I have yet to tour the museum to look at the exhibits, but I do plan to return and explore when I have some time. I visited after somewhat accidentally discovering Habib Koite was playing a few days later. Several years ago I used to work at Barnes & Noble's music department in Atlanta and I discover Habib's music and enjoyed his mastery of the guitar. The web site was easy to navigate and I found I could get seats in the front row for $37.50. I quickly booked two.   The most challenging and stressful aspect was getting there. Not due to the museum itself, but more me and my GPS. I typed in the address of 4725 Mayo and it told me that didn't exist and changed it to 4800. I thought it would be close, but then decided to search by business and did find it showed MIM, but it said unknown road. 10 people "Liked" it so I assumed it was accurate. As I turned off onto Shea my girlfriend who did visit once on a school field trip for her daughter said she didn't think it was right. I was lost with 10 minutes prior to the show. I did something men do not usually do - I called for directions. The representative gave me clear directions and I managed to pull into the parking lot at 7:02. Picking up tickets at guest services was quick and painless. Thankfully, the director was making announcements when we took our seats and we didn't miss any of the show.   The atmosphere in the concert hall was amazing. It was small and comfortable. Although we were in the first row I don't think there was a bad seat in the house. The thing that amazed me the most was the sound. The stage has the perfect acoustics. I was amazed and enjoyed the performance. While I was familiar with Habib Koite I was not familiar with his partner Eric Bibb. Eric is a Memphis-blues guy and Habib is from Mali. Blues has its roots in African music and the two blended together perfectly. Both guys were very friendly, were excellent story tellers which made the songs even more enjoyable. After the show they signed autographs in the hallway and we toured the MIM gift shop at the end of the night. I wanted to buy the Gangster Rap Coloring book but passed  - next time!  I will definitely return to see other shows and I would like to actually see the exhibits. I definitely recommend this museum.

I walked in without a prior order and wanted to pick up a tres leche cake for my girlfriend's birthday. The sign stated they open at 9 and I arrived to find them already open. The place smelled wonderful! There were some completed cakes already. The owner was very helpful in telling me how many they serve and what my options were. I selected one from the shelf, but then also one that needed some preparation. The cake was already baked, but I could select the added flavor. He also wrote a birthday message on both for no charge. I will definitely come back!

This Christmas breakfast screams bah-humbug! The restaurant was busy Christmas morning. It appears I'm not the only one without things to do on the holiday. The menu highlighted three holiday items: a spiced ham, pumpkin pancakes, and bread pudding french toast.   I ordered a chocolate milk, eggs, hash browns and chose the French toast and pancakes.... I do love pumpkin...This completed the Grand Slam, but this meal was more like a swing and a miss.  The food arrived quickly and looked good. The hashbrown and eggs were average fare. The pancakes looked good - (as seen from the photo). But while the flavor was good, the pancakes were not hot. They arrived with a lump of butter and were so cold that never melted. It didn't attempt to melt. It just sat that like a big lump of butter that it was. I had to scrape it off to the side. That was disappointing but maybe the French toast will be better? Not so much. The slices were also cold, thick, dry, and a wee bit hard. Bleck!  Looks like Denny's left me a lump of coal for Christmas.

A fairly underwhelming selection of football products. The store is somewhat small, so I am sure inventory concerns impact the product line. Maybe it is just me, but I don't think it would be too challenging to identify customer interest and offer products to fit the need.    Baseball season is winding down, so a reduction in baseball products would make sense. Have some minimal offerings for Diamondbacks and a couple of teams that might actually make the playoffs. The majority of people shopping now most likely are interested in football. For the Cardinals, 95% of people who want a regular Cardinals jersey already have one, so focus on the new black alternative jersey (which they did have a nice selection at $80 for a replica and $110 for an authentic).   Besides Cardinals products, college football would be a main focus. With schools back in session and the college schedule starting last week that is probably a high interest product right now. In the crazy scheme to make money, I would expect sporting goods stores to have a big selection right now. And considering most people are not from here, a selection of other schools would be nice to see. Again, given the size of the store the number of schools would be limited and I probably would not find my Marshall Thundering Herd on the shelf, but it should be more than only ASU and AU.   Having went to Dicks, Champs and the Sports Chalet only to discover none of them had jerseys except a couple offering ASU or AU, I went back to Just Sports. No jerseys, but they did have a few t-shirts. Again, mostly ASU with some AU - then I stumbled on a Wake Forest shirt. That seemed odd...but soon I found a handful of other schools. It was all the same design of shirt, which resembled only slightly higher quality than a Tent City screen-print station, but for my needs it would have to do. I flipped through the one rack about four times hoping something would jump out. Finally worker A tore himself away from the conversation with worker B and asked if I was looking for a particular team. When I said yeah, one that doesn't suck, he only offered the comments "Good luck". The shirts were decently priced - $20 for 2 or $12.99 for one, but the selection made it a challenge to find one - let alone two.

This location near the San Tan mall large selection of products.  The location was convenient to the Loop 202 as well as the mall. I stopped in on Monday late morning to pick up a few items. I met the new store manager, Liz. She was very nice, helpful and knowledgeable. She is working on a Doctorate and has a Masters in nutrition. She listened to what I was interested in and recommended similar products. One of the products I mentioned she warned me of the dangers and told me that there are other, safer options. I didn't feel like she was trying to up sell me on anything.  I would go back to this location again.

What lives in 360 days of sun, has two thumbs and recently paid for a month of unlimited tanning? This guy! Yes, it sounds crazy for someone who lives in an area with over 30 days of 100+ degree temperatures and endless sun to pay for tanning - but recently I learned of an upcoming high school reunion (actually my 21st)...and my former classmates know I have lived in Arizona for 5 years - I cannot return to Ohio looking like Casper the Friendly Ghost. Could I lay out in the sun? Trust me - you don't want to see this naked. I don't think you're ready for this jelly. So where can I pasty white fat guy go to get some color? Fahrenheit Tanning, that's where.  It is conveniently located in the parking lot with my gym, so it makes it easy to take advantage of the unlimited sessions. A side benefit is laying in the bed gets my muscles warm and ready to go before hitting the gym. There are multiple levels to chose from, each with a different price. I chose the level 1 bed. You might want the 2 or 3 depending on your needs. They also have specials, such as one free week if you purchase a two week unlimited package, or the one I received - two free weeks with the purchase of a one month package. For those who want to commit to at least 6 months, there is a VIP package that provides about a 50% savings over the other options. The unlimited one month package on a level 1 bed cost $49. There is a little tax to that and an upcoming surcharge thanks to the Healthcare bill, but for length of time I need it, it provides a good deal.  The store is staffed with friendly workers who were able to answer all of my questions. It is easy to get started with a membership. The rooms are spacious and clean. The fan & radio make it a nice time. Hopefully over the next couple of weeks Fahrenheit Tanning will help turn this Stay Puft Marshmallow Man into a toasty s'more. If you want some color but don't want to lay out in the hot Sonoran sun, give Fahrenheit a shot.

I visit this location regularly and unfortunately I find the attention to detail minimal. Typically I order through the drive thru and usually order the grilled chicken & fruit salad. On three separate trips recently I have returned home to find that while the receipt was correct, I received the grilled chicken garden salad. I have also switched it around and ordered fruit and grilled chicken salad. One time that worked, but most recently I again received the garden salad. Finally I called and complained. How difficult is it? If it is entered correctly, why can't the correct product be pulled?   If you go through the drive thru, I highly recommend pulling over and checking the bag before driving home.

Bruce Banner has to fight to keep the Hulk contained. I fight the same battle with Vanilla Heat. Born in Jamaica's Hedonism 3 resort I regularly feasted on jerk chicken, rice, and plantains. While I have managed well over the past couple of years to keep VH under control, I did have a hankering for Caribbean food this weekend and found A Taste of the Caribbean at Baseline & Mill. I could feel Vanilla Heat fighting to get out.  From my table I could hear the sizzle from the chicken as it cooked and I began looking forward to its arrival. While waiting I looked at my mobile app and saw several Yelp reviews and the only negative thing I really saw was the level of spice. I am not sure if the owners made a change, but the jerk chicken was spicy on my visit. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender and had an excellent flavor. It came with a side of red beans & rice, cabbage, and 3 plantains. The owner told me if I needed more rice, cabbage, or plantains to ask him.  The restaurant is small and colorful with very pleasant decorations, and Pandora played nice reggae rhythms. This restaurant took me back to my trip to Jamaica and provided the best jerk chicken I have had since. Thankfully it didn't take me all the way back, else I would have ran naked through the parking lot yelling SHABBA! But any time I need a jerk chicken fix this will be the spot!

A couple of monkeys from the zoo could provide better customer service and water supply than the folks at Johnson Utilities.  A check for payment of the current water bill was mailed Friday February 11 had not yet cleared the bank. A letter was received February 23 in the mail indicating payment had not been made, a $1.32 late penalty applied and a disconnect notice for a bill that was due on the 15th.   I don't know if it is a one person operation, but it is very difficult to reach anyone on the phone. Calling usually results in a busy signal. They are only open from 8am - 4:45 and they take an hour for lunch (shutting off the phones). When I finally reached someone they indicated the check was not received and they would accept payment over the phone. They do not accept American Express, so I provided a Visa. The amount of the missing check was paid over the phone and the charge processed February 22. Naturally, the missing check was located and also cashed on February 23. Today I receive a statement dated February 28 (which has yet to occur), stamped February 24 showing that the funds from neither the 22nd nor 23rd have been applied. Of course calling in resulted in busy signals followed by a message indicating they were now closed until Monday.   Another thing that appears to be fishy is the minimum charge. The bill includes the statement "water minimum $27". It shows the actual water usage was $6.25 - to me, and I think most normal places, it means that $27 is the magic number - if you exceed $27 in charges, you are billed that amount. If you do not, you are charged the minimum $27. Not at Johnson Utilities - the new math for these folks is the minimum plus the usage.   This operation is a waste of office space. Help the local economy and hire some folks to answer the phone and address customer questions. You might want to hire someone in accounting to process payments timely, someone in the mailroom to not lose the mail and an office manager who can oversee the efficiency of the office.

I come here every single Tuesday. The have $1 tacos and burritos. The red and green sauce is amazing. I have never tried anything other than the tacos (shredded beef, chicken, ground beef) or the burrito (I went with shredded beef). The burrito is large and filling. The tacos are excellent. This place has a drive thru as well and is always busy.  If it's Tuesday and you have a few bucks, stop here.

Your basic combination of standard gelato store & Coldstone Creamery. A large selection of gelato, smooties and Coldstone-like combination desserts. I went with the Black Coffee - coffee gelato, Heath Bar & pecans. Good flavors, fast & friendly service. The medium with tax was $5.50 - pretty typical.  One detraction - I believe the stone was not cold enough - the gelato was very soft and melted soon after leaving the store. Maybe best to eat there.

When I am at home living the high life in Queen Creek, this is my closest Chipotle. I do tend to prefer it to the Costa Vida across the street, although some times the lines can be long. A big ole' burrito is always good, but typically I go with the chicken bowl. Two chicken bowls and a side of chips & quac will run about $16, but it is good for what is somewhat fast  food.   This location always has good service. I visited last night and asked the guy for some of the fajita vegetables - no problem. I ordered the chicken bowl and he said they barely had enough for one serving, so if I wanted he would give me half chicken and have steak.  Which leads to why this is 4 stars and not 5 - apparently chicken is the big seller, so why would you run out? I have to admit since I received the last of the chicken I wasn't really as concerned as the lady behind me who was told it would be a six and a half minute wait while the guy finished grilling the chicken. Maybe its just me, but if you know folks like to eat chicken, is it that difficult to look in the bucket, see it getting low and think maybe you need to throw some yard birds on the fire?   Maybe a little operations management/inventory control is needed - but the food and service receives high marks!

Recently I needed to call my insurance company for a windshield replacement. They provided a recommendation of Best Glass for the install. I spoke to Renee and the process to set up the installation was quick and efficient. He confirmed the appointment for the next day, asked what time I leave the office and set the appointment for between the hours of 9-2.  Today was the big day for the installation. As the hours passed I did not receive a  phone call from the technician or the home office. Knowing that most companies indicate a car should sit for at least 2 hours prior to driving, and I leave work at 3, I began to get nervous as my lunch break expired. 1:55 and still nothing. Knowing it takes typically 40 minutes to complete a windshield installation, I elected to call and speak to Renee to cancel the service call. In doing so, he said the installer was just 15 minutes away from me. I said that's fine, but it is 2:00 now, 15 minutes plus the installation time makes me late, so I would cancel. I indicated that I heard it should sit a few hours before driving and he said typically in one hour it would be fine. Okay, but that still makes me late. He said no, that's from the time the glass first makes contact. Still the time table seemed sketchy and there is a safety hazard with driving unsettled glass. Given the heat, warm days also make the contact more slippery and require longer to form a tight seal. Nevertheless, Renee said it would be okay to complete the work and still leave at 3. I cancelled anyway - then contacted the insurance company to correctly cancel.   While on the phone with the insurance company, I felt the vibration in my ear indicating an incoming call. I finished the cancellation and listened to the newly left voicemail from Ray, the Best Glass technician indicating he was 5 minutes away. Now 2:10, that definitely does not leave time to arrive and complete the work. He persisted and called back; this time I picked up the call.   In speaking to Ray, who was now apparently in front of the building, I voiced my concern that it would take 40 minutes to complete the installation - putting me late for going home. He said he could probably get it done in about 20 minutes.   My concern is that the company's own web site has a FAQ page (http://www.bestglass.com/faq.html#faq5) that reads "Because of the complexity of some vehicles, it could take as long as 3 hours. Most vehicles, however, require about an hour to an hour and a half to properly install the windshield." My concern is further documented on the same page stating "If an installer claims he can install your windshield in 30 minutes or less, it's a sure bet it won't be done right and certainly not safe." It seems the company's own technicians and operation personnel do not heed their own warning.   I told Ray that even after it would be installed it should set for a couple of hours and was told it would be okay in probably 30 minutes. Again, the company web site states "While most automotive grade urethane's rely on temperature and humidity to cure, the time required varies widely depending on the manufacturer. This time frame can range from 3 hours up to 24 hours before your vehicle will meet Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and is considered safe to drive." What about 30 minutes? Their web site warns "If you need to drive your vehicle sooner, a chemically cured urethane can be used that will allow a 1 hour drive-away time. In either case, it's imperative that you follow the manufacturers' instructions regarding safe drive-away times. Not adhering to those instructions could result in your injury or even death."   Yikes!   It appears that the company provides a good web page that explains the dangers of improper installation advice and potential safety hazards leading to injury or even death. The shame is that their staff does not follow their own advice.   Based on my experience today, I would steer clear of this company!

I recently suffered a Zumba injury and my doctor was on vacation. As I was barely able to walk, her office staff suggested I visit San Tan Urgent Care for treatment. Some friends warned me that I would most likely have to wait several hours in the waiting room for treatment, but this is Queen Creek and I have yet to experience long waits in any health care facility. Once again it turned out to be true. I arrived just prior to the 9:00 am opening and was back in my car by 9:25.   You can go to the web site and print off the paper work if you are a first time patient. That sped up the process for me and got me to a staff member quickly. He looked at the leg, diagnosed a partial tear in a calf muscle and set me up with some crutches and muscle relaxers. One thing I appreciated was his concern for cost. He stated that the only way to determine the true severity of the injury was an MRI, but most likely the insurance company would not pay for that if he ordered the test. His suggestion was to visit my doctor when she returns next week and if she submitted the order, most likely the insurance would pick up the charge. Good advice, easy in and quickly out of the office.

I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream! Thankfully real ice cream has arrived in Queen Creek. We have had the yogurt jungle, but c'mon, that's like hankerin' for a big Thanksgiving turkey and having to settle for tofurkey.  The store provides a wide selection - the traditional scooped ice cream, in addition to soft serve and the 31 Below shake. Very kid friendly with child size items, novelties like the baseball helmet sundae and the occassional free cone day. In honor of the upcoming football season, the flavor for September is Quarterback Crunch. I went with the oreo sundae and it was excellent ($4.99).   Fairly standard operation as far as chains go, but I expect the store to do well in the limited selection Queen Creek area.

After discovering my side yard flooded due to a leak from the irrigation system, I knew my man card did not extend to knowing how to locate and repair the problem. The lady at my dry cleaners referred me to Copper Canyon after I mentioned the no-show from Cloud 9. She gave me the phone number, I called that afternoon and had an appointment scheduled a few days later. The problem was I wouldn't be in town - not that I was going to help dig a hole or check the system, but I thought I needed to be there. Not so. Tammy was very friendly, gave me an appointment and said she would contact me with a quote. She texted the information the next day and I agreed to an appointment.  The company has a good reputation. They have worked on local schools, the owner of San Tan dry cleaner also stated he uses them and gives them a high recommendation. Tammy stated that they do several properties in my neighborhood and are out every week.   When I returned I was pleased with the maintenance completed on the front and back yard (I was surprised to see they even mowed the yard), and I have not seen any flooding in the yard since they came out. Rather than digging up the entire yard and looking for a leak, it turned out to be two broken sprinkler heads (which I would never have looked at). A small fix for $20.   Copper Canyon offers bi-weekly and monthly maintenance options, will design landscaping, add/remove plants and install barbeque features. I am glad that I found this company and will continue to use them on a monthly basis.

Huge selection of Halloween costumes and props. The little spinning playground merry-go-round with little zombie babies was particularly creepy. The store is large and laid out well. Plenty of costume options for every size and style. I saw some of the items listed as new and hot for 2010 such as Avatar, Jersey Shore and of course all of the vampire craze. I was only there for a few accessories, but I found it quickly with the assistance of the friendly staff. Check out was quick, but I am sure that will get longer as Halloween draws closer. Stop in now and avoid the rush.

I was a little surprised. My wife loves crepes and I wanted to take her to breakfast on our way home from Vegas. Our first choice had a 45 minute wait and I didn't want to stay that long. We found a second place with another long wait. Using the Yelp app I found this place. Lots of reviews, high star rating, but I didn't read the reviews. I suggested we try it. I was please seeing the door was open and there was no line. Walking inside I thought it was a little odd because it looked like a Baskin Robbins, and when I saw the menu say it comes with your choice of ice cream I thought that was odd. I noticed the photos with waffles, but didn't pay attention to the others I guess. The waffles looked big and delicious; we ordered the crepes. We were talking and drinking a coffee when the guy behind the counter brought my wife's order. We both looked puzzled at it and him because it was like an ice cream cone. She looked at me and asked how she was going to eat that. Mine came next and it too was a cone.  Then I read the Yelp reviews and saw it was a dessert place and not a breakfast place. It was probably way too sweet for 10 AM, but it was very good. I would definitely come back and order it in the late afternoon or early evening sometime. I had the Elvis and it was excellent. She ordered the Rebel but doesn't like Nutella so it was basically strawberry and banana. The place was super clean and the staff very friendly. It turned out to be a good find even though it wasn't what we were looking for at that time.

Excellent craft beer selection with 22 taps. Third Thursday of every month is tap takeover with 1-2 breweries invited to bring in their brews. This is a good way to experience some hard to find beers. I attended the Lost Abbey/Port Brewing Co. takeover last week. $6/draft. Some available earlier in the day but most start at 6:30. Good establishment to try something new.

Given the lack of dining options in Queen Creek, I had to try this newly opened restaurant. Now I can cross that task off my list.   The restaurant is a little small and customers can seat themselves. My friend ordered the #10 combo: a tamale (chicken) and enchilada (cheese). I ordered #2 taco (chicken) and burrito (chicken). One thing to note - the first basket of chips & salsa (and beans) is free, but subsequent baskets are charged. So don't eat up unless you want to pay extra. That wasn't a worry for us because while the salsa wasn't bad, neither of us liked the beans. Kind of a weird flavor. That was repeated when we received our meals, which came with rice and beans. I wasn't a fan of the beans then either.  My plate was very good - the street taco was packed. Squeeze a bit of the lime on it and it was very good. The burrito also was packed and although I don't recall spraying it with lime, the chicken had a hint of lime there as well. As Kevin R. pointed out, the rice was excellent.   My friend's first comments were that the enchilada was very cheese - which is a good characteristic of a cheese enchilada. That was where the highlight of her plate ended. The tamale? Not so much...in fact it was kind of eeck. We both thought it tasted of freezer burn, either way she ate a total of 1/3 of one of the two that came with the order.   The staff was very friendly. One waitress took our drink order, then two others stopped by to see if someone had taken our drink order. I don't know if that speaks of the attentiveness of the staff, or the perceived slowness of our waitress. Later when our server asked if we wanted a refill, one of the other ladies stopped by to ask the same question.   If I go back, I would probably just go with an order of the street tacos. Those were excellent and everything else was just sort of okay. Most likely I won't come back, but if I did that's what I'd get.

Some friends and I stopped by Tasty Thai for lunch. One of them recently discovered it and suggested it as a nearby option. There are several to choose from in that area and I have been to a couple of others. One thing I liked is the location was close to work and thanks to many of the businesses in the shopping center being out of business; there were plenty of places to park - unlike trying to find a spot at Thai Basil. If I could continue to benchmark against Thai Basil, I felt cramped while seated there, but Tasty Thai was spacious and comfortable. It was also much quieter than other places.  The food arrived very quickly. We each had a lunch special - which consisted of the entrée, rice, Thai spring rolls and soup or salad. The drinks and soup arrived first, but as soon as we finished the egg drop soup, the meal came out. Each ordered something different- I know one was the Pad Gra Prow, which I understood was spicier and more flavorful than other similar restaurants; another ordered the Pad Prik King, and that was tasty as well. A third member of our party went with the Kung Pao from the "More Asian Style" selection, and the fourth person had the Red Curry with Tofu. I ordered the Masaman Curry Chicken - incredible! The flavors of coconut milk and tamarind were present, soft potatoes, onion and a sweet (but not too sweet) curry. It was one of the more flavorful plates I have had at any restaurant.  Based on my initial visit, I will definitely be back. Of the Thai restaurants I have tried in town, this new restaurant tops the list. And, as an added benefit if you live within a 3 mile radius and place a minimum order of $20 - they deliver.

Very fast preparation. Ordered the sandwich and it was ready by the time I made it down the counter. Regular subs are $4.25 for about 6". Loved the crushed ice in the soda machine. Right on the end of Tempe Marketplace next to D'Arcy McGee. The bread didn't blow my skirt up; a little stiffer than subway, but fresh.  I ordered the #5: Vito. Basic Italian sub. Good choice. Few seating options might be the drawback. Room for 10; otherwise it's carry out

This is a newer LA Fitness and located on the corner of University & Stapley. I regularly go to 6 different LA Fitnesses each week and this is the best of all of them. The machines are top of the line with an entire row + of treadmills. Each has a digital readout and a television if you want to watch while running. The spin room is amazing with the instructor on the floor and multiple rows of bikes in a stadium seating layout. I go for the Tuesday 5:45 zumba with Scheyla. Get there early because the room gets filled to capacity each week.

I have completed this run (obviously not the 27th annual edition) 5 times now. The course is always the same - a bit hillier than other Papgo courses as it takes a right along the sidewalk behind the zoo, but the organization is always excellent. The t-shirt is another good draw to this event - a long sleeve shirt that changes color in the sun. There is always food at the end, a raffle, and a great crowd. One of the best events on the racing calendar each year and an excellent way to start the new year off right!

Given the limited options of dining in Queen Creek (not even "fine", just non-drive-thru), I have often said whomever builds the first restaurant here will reap the rewards.   The Olive Garden opened on the 10th with limited hours during the first few weeks. They open at 4pm during the week and have typically hours during the weekend. Don't expect to walk right in and sit right down like in the Super Cuts commercials. The herding begins in the parking lot before the doors open and the line is instantly formed. For now, it is best to just call in and get the curb-side take-away service.  Knowing the difficulties that would lie ahead, I called the order in for pick up. The wait was still going to be 25-30 minutes. In the parking lot you do have to park and walk into the restaurant. There is a separate take out counter; however, the throngs of people waiting the lobby, those in line to put their name on the list and not knowing how to form a straight line, those sitting on the benches waiting to be called, and the other people wanting to fight their way through the crowd to get a visual on the available seating in the bar area make for a constant dance to allow the traffic to slowly move.   Another challenge is that they ask for your first name - so if you are fortunate enough to be in line as I was tonight when two guys with the same name arrived at the same time (and naturally the wrong guy was charged for the wrong order), extra time is added. Once insitead it took me another 10 minutes or so to pay, then another 10 minutes for them to bring it up from the kitchen.  Despite the traffic flow issues and the hordes of customers, that's to be expected for a newly opened restaurant in an area that doesn't have many sit-down choices. And from my recent trip to Italy feasting on plain chicken breast and peas, I have come to learn that the Olive Garden isn't that bad of a choice. They will do well here and hopefully send a signal to other future restaurants.

A new frozen yogurt shop has opened in San Tan Valley/Queen Creek! It is conveniently located next to the Dance Matrix studio I visit, so after dazzling my partner on the dance floor, I could go for FroYo.   This is basically like all the frozen yogurt places out there, except it is on my side of QC! The flavors were good - I saw a pistachio I wanted to try, but then I saw coffee (which is my favorite ice cream), banana - which I would be good to try and mix with something...but then I was swayed by thin mint and cake batter.  The prices here are the same as most others - 39 cents per ounce. They have a loyalty program as do the others - but they take your phone number so you don't have to worry about losing the little punch card then ultimately having multiple cards. Good seating, nice lighting, and a comfortable atmosphere.

Everything you loved...okay, hated...about Tio Oso's and then less. Despite the not so long ago name and genre change, Tio Oso's has been sold to new management. The new owners are the guy who ran Margaritaville on the Las Vegas Strip and his brother.   I cannot comment yet on the food, but here are some things I have observed and do not like. Being a change in management, the bartenders I did like at Tio Oso's are no longer there. Also gone is the free chips and salsa I used to enjoy at the bar. Still there is the nearly $6 happy hour margarita - and based on my experience, I was disappointed. The frozen margarita comes from a machine and most of it was ice. While trying to drink it, 1/3 was just slush that I had to wait to melt before I could drink further.   Overall I wasn't impressed. The margaritas are overpriced, especially given the slushy consistency and I missed the chips/salsa and my favorite bartender.

I was looking at Art of Merlot for a potential date spot, so I signed up to check it out on my own first to make sure it was a good place. I have always wanted to learn to paint and I thought this would be a good way to have fun attempting it. Plus I have a really long plain white wall in my apartment and I thought it would be perfect for displaying art - and what better art than mine? I am a Libra so I need to be creative   I took that 1pm Saturday class with a painting of butterflies in the meadow. I thought that would be cool. Really when you consider how much a canvas, paint, brushes, and an easel costs, the $45 I spent to register is a great price. The class was small - only four other people. That meant a lot of 1:1 interaction and attention on our efforts. I have seen the business on Facebook and found it hard to believe everyone was creating nice paintings - but I saw it for myself!  The studio is great (parking is challenging anywhere in downtown Scottsdale), Audra was amazing with all of us and worked to make sure we were relaxed and having fun. This place rocked and was one of the best experiences. I would highly recommend it to everyone and will be coming back with a date. I don't know how I missed the Yelp event here, but I am sad I did.

Preparing for an upcoming trip to Ireland, I decided to stop by a pub for lunch - and Shakespeare's is the closest one I know. I have driven past it before, but never stopped. Just past noon on a Saturday it was mostly empty. The host gave me my choice of bar, low top or high top. I selected the high top and was escorted to the back room, alone and in the somewhat dimly lit corner. Just to my liking!  The waiter kept calling my "boss", which I liked and accepted as recognition of my powerful appearance rather than the sarcastic method of calling a bald person "curly" or a short person "stretch"...  I started with a nice, cold Smithwick's ale. I ordered the cod fish and chips with mushy peas - and to my surprise it arrived very quickly. The meal included fries and two pieces of fish. The first piece was a good size and very tasty - crisp outside, tender and flaky inside. Looking down at the second piece - holy cow! Grabbing it I felt as if I just reeled in a whooper on the Bass Masters Tour. That baby was 13" long - and I know what 13" looks like...I wear a 13" shoe...look at the size of the fish compared to the large pint glass in the photo. Impressive!  Needless to say, I couldn't finish the second piece of fish and left half of the fries. The restaurant was nice and quiet in the back, but I am sure it fills up when bands are there, karaoke and maybe trivia night - but for a quiet Saturday where one is looking for dimly lit solitude and a nice ale, this did the job.

I am not into guys and really don't like them for almost any purpose - but I do need them. There are women that talk to guys at the bar, and sometimes the decision on which bar to go to is based on the type of guys that go there. Word gets out that I am going somewhere that's good enough to draw 15-20 women, but much more than that requires a good base of male customers. I don't think this place is going to do that.   I selected Mad Dog Saloon for a few reasons: 1) it was a nice afternoon and they have a large patio, 2) it is a new establishment and 3) it's close to home. When I arrived I sent a text to my friend in Ohio that it was a weird combination of douche bags and bikers. His return text asked if I read the quick tips on Yelp. Admittedly, I had not. Quick Tip number 1 at the time was from Trenton T. and it said "lots of douche bags, weird crowd"...that sums it up well. There were four guys in close proximity to me. Two had the reverse hat going, another had the sunglasses in the back of the shirt, and the fourth appeared to be normal. The next table was a large group of bikers, as was the back of the bar. I don't think this is the crowd that is going to attract the ladies. I can't do it all myself people; work with me.  What about the good things? Yes, there were some. Good thing 1: It actually is close to my home. Within a mile, so I could easily walk back should I have to do so. Good thing 2: the Aztec burger was pretty good and at $9 it was comparable to other places, but here is the thing (Good thing 3): regular fries are included with the meal, but seasoned fries or sweet potato fries are available at no extra cost. Good thing 4: It's large. One prior review said the inside was like a warehouse - yes, but I don't mind that. It is very spacious, it has games and tvs to enjoy and plenty of seats. That's a positive to me. The outdoor seating was spacious and had a great amount of open air (and more TV0 to make the day enjoyable.  Another negative I found, besides the customers, was the service was slow. It took me a while to get an order in and get a drink. Once I did it took a while to come (even the beer). My waitress was cute though...although overall I wasn't impressed by the staff. The food was good when it did arrive and my server did check up on several times, but she seemed to be more talkative with the two dorks in the backwards hats.   Come for the sweet potato fries and the nice outdoor patio before it gets too hot. Come for a large, spacious place inside and out, but the rest of it wasn't anything to get carried away about. I will probably go again because I live so close, but maybe I will search for other better places.

Jerk chicken is one of my favorite meals. I noticed I had this place bookmarked, and it is close to my work. I decided to finally check it out. The parking was a little challenging as it shares a parking lot with a tattoo shop and there are only a few spots behind the store. Walking inside it was small - a couple of tables up front and a row of seats down the a bar against the wall.   The man behind the counter was very friendly and when he asked if it was my first time there he walked me through it and made some recommendations. I had the jerk chicken, two styles of rice with "gravy", cabbage, and a couple plantains. I picked up a bottle of Ting as well.   The chicken was flavorful, not too spicy, and the sides were excellent. While eating another gentleman came up and asked how I liked it. He was very polite and asked if I needed anything else. I saw a plaque stating they won 2013 Best Jerk award, and I can't disagree. It was one of the top that I have had.   The food was great, the service even better. The one thing I would change is the music. They had a local radio station playing, but I would prefer to hear reggae while eat Jamaican food - make it a total experience. The club music just didn't fit.  Being that close to work and a good experience, I will definitely be back.

I know a lot of you who have met me have said to yourself (and sometimes to your friends) "Man, I would love to see that guy naked and covered in chocolate" - well you could have had your chance. For Valentine's Day I purchased a Chocolate Lovers couples massage here based on reviews I read online from news outlets and blogs recommending Valentine's gifts. Being Valentine's week the spa ran a sale on the package and by joining the couples club I saved an additional amount.   When we decided to book the massage it was an easy process. We arrived a little before the appointment and checked in. We were taken back to the locker room and given a robe and slippers. First up was a chocolate exfoliating scrub from head to toe.  The music was soothing and the ladies were excellent. After that it was time to shower off and return back for a chocolate body wrap. Think of the best chocolate brownie you ever had in your life and wanted to spend the whole day with. I smelled just like that. Then it was back to the shower again and a return for a massage with chocolate lotion.   The day ended with time on the patio enjoying lemon and coconut ice cream. There are other snacks in the atrium that are free for the taking. It is nice to relax on the patio with the ice cream and look over the lake. Just remember to keep your robe closed because there are apartments across the lake. The couples massage package lasted for 2 hours and was one of the most relaxing times ever. I can't wait to go back and try other services.

I am a little confused by the restaurant and unsure if my review should go here or be listed as a new business. The reason for the confusion is the combination of names that exit. My girlfriend said she recently saw a new restaurant called Don Camaron and wanted to take her mom out for her birthday. She gave me the name and the general location, but I was unable to find it on Yelp or other services. Google turned up similarly named restaurants in other places. Ultimately we found the information on Facebook. As we pulled up we noted the sign stated Don Camaron was "Now Open". We pulled into the parking lot of Urban Heat. As I walked toward the restaurant the sign on the sidewalk read Don Camaron, but the name above the door read Urban Heat. Instead the decor had Urban Heat, but also a logo of the Don Camaron shrimp. The menu read Urban Heat (but had the shrimp logo), the paper ring around the napkin read Urban Heat, and upon check out the receipt reads Urban Heat. Perhaps it is going through a transition and it is both places? The waitress that I had was also very new. She didn't seem to understand me well and she was unfamiliar with the food.   It appears to be a bar/restaurant, which is how Urban Heat (and the receipt) describe it. The menu included mostly appetizers, tacos, fish, and shrimp. The back page showed multiple types of beer in bottles and draft, but they did not have all of those. One draft they have Bud, Bud Light, Michelob, and "Amber Bock". I asked what Amber Bock and the server did not know. It was either Michelob or Dos X. Either way, it was decent and $2.75 but I received an additional $1.83 discount (maybe happy hour?). There were only maybe 6 other people there besides the 5 of us, so it wasn't a big crowd if it was happy hour.  We received chips and salsa first (free). My girlfriend's son ordered a hamburger ($8) and I was surprised how quickly it arrived. It was a good size burger served with a side of fries. It was cooked just a little more well-done that I would have liked. My girlfriend's daughter & mom each ordered the Coco Camaron, which is a coconut with shrimp ceviche and shrimp inside. It also had two whole shrimp with heads, eyes, and legs (yuck) mounted on top of the coconut ($16). My girlfriend went with the fish filet ala plancha that was served with a very tasty side of rice and a nice looking salad. This was a nice-sized portion ($9) and I was a little sad that I hadn't ordered it, but I was afraid it would resemble the fried whole fish that was also shown on the menu (yuck again). Instead I went with the nachos (add carne asada), which was supposed to be $6.99 + $2 for the carne, but it appears I was only charge $6.99). My girlfriend also ordered a shrimp cocktail for $12. Throw in a pina colada for $5.50, a $1.83 bottle of water, and a $1.83 bottle of coke - then my girlfriend's daughter decided she would rather have had a hamburger and fries like her brother (another $8) and soon the bill was $95 for the 5 of us.  Some pros - I liked the live Maine lobster claw machine. I don't know if the customer gets to eat the lobster if the claw game picks it up, but it was interesting. The deco was nice, but again with the differences in the name I don't know if that will stay. The fish filet was another highlight of the meal.  Otherwise, the hamburgers were a little too well done, my nachos were just okay (and certainly a much smaller portion than the fish filet plate), the server was unsure of the menu, the beer selection was limited, and I wasn't sure what restaurant I was actually visiting. Whatever restaurant it was (Don Camaron or Urban Heat), I don't think it was $95 good. Maybe if there are some big happy hour specials and the name gets worked out it would be worth revisiting, but right now I don't think so.

I have ran the PF Chang half marathon for six out of the ten years it has been in existence. The early days were a little rough at times. Parking was challenging and boarding buses to go to the state capital building felt a little like Monster's Ball. Over the years the race organizers have really worked to improve everything. Last year the half and marathon starting locations were separated and that has been a nice change. The half starts on Mill Avenue and that has helped parking. This year I was able to park at Chili's without any problems. Lineup is easy, plenty of water & Gatorade stations along the way - even PF Chang CEO Rick Federico volunteered at a water station during the race.  The expo is always busy, but it is Friday & Saturday which gives plenty of time to pick up the race bib. There are good speakers and plenty of vendors in attendance. One thing I truly appreciate is the ease of getting in and out. The expo in Las Vegas is confusing to locate even in the hotel it's located. The PF Chang expo is well marked and laid out.    There is plenty of bands along the way and the race always has a follow-up headline concert. I don't typically stay for the concert because the bands chosen are always someone I have never heard of or some group that was popular 20-30 years ago and not seen since.   The race organizers have also recently added the ability to pick up the Heavy Medal Series medals there at the finish. For runners who complete the Rock n Roll Las Vegas and the PF Chang half marathon they receive a Double Down medal from the Competitor Race Group. Typically they are mailed, but now can be picked up at the end. Love it!

I have a friend who lives in Scottsdale and when we meet up for drinks close to his apartment this is where we go. This is a good spot that is conveniently located right off 101 & Frank Lloyd Wright exit. Same type of theme as Hooters or Tilted Kilt, but I like it more. I have yet to have any food there that was not good. My typical order is the average joes - three small slider-type hot dogs.  If you want to go big order the BBQ pulled pork nachos - amazing! (and cheap). The chicken-fried chicken is what my friend usually orders. I have not had it myself, but it is huge and he always orders it.  The last time we went we had a friend from out of town that ordered fried pickles and the Hangover burger. He enjoyed both. The bread pudding is an excellent choice for dessert. They have a large selection of beer, but they also have their own; I prefer the Nutty Brunette. I definitely recommend it.

I stumbled upon this florist while trying to find orchids for my fiancée.  I called a couple of other florists regarding price and availability. When I called Cactus Flower the initial price was cheaper than the others I called, and they were located off of the same street I live on. When I found the store I was impressed by the large selection of flowers. I was even more happy to find a sign that read orchid sale. Score! I asked what that meant. The sale was for orchids in a pot, which isn't wasn't what I wanted. I asked about other orchids and the return question asked what kind? I gave a blank stare. She narrowed it down to two kinds of orchids available, which I cannot even list here because the terminology was so foreign I just heard long words that I cannot remember.  My inner monologue turned to Butthead and thought "uuuhh....I'm a dude....". Somehow we picked one.   We walked in the cooler and she picked out the flowers. She said oh, and it's happy hour! My inner voice perked up again and added "Dang right it is!" I know what happy hour meant to me, but what does it mean for a flower shop? So I asked. "What does that mean?". As it turns out, from 12-5 it was 50% cash and carry - so the price I thought was already good was now half price. Since I already had an budget in mind that meant more flowers - so I added more orchids and 12 roses  - mostly red, but they had a variety of roses so I mixed it up.   Leaving the store the lady wrapped them up very nicely. She told me promise me that I will take these straight home and/or not leave them in the hot car. She said if I am not going straight home, take them with me. She didn't care if I was going in the manliest place on earth (or at least Chandler) - she said walk in with them like I was Miss America. I elected to go home first and drop them off before going out to do my normal manly routines.   I was very pleased with my find and experience. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable in helping me with the selection. I will return here again rather than order a mail-order in a box like I used to do.

I am really digging this place. My wife has come here a few times, but until this weekend I had never been. The selection of soups, sandwiches, and salads is impressive. Everything is fresh and made in front of you. The best part is the sandwiches and salads (I had the combo) is larger and cheaper than other similar places. Other chains give you half a sandwich and soup for $10, but Zupas was a whole sandwich, the soup, bread, and a chocolate covered strawberry for $8. I am definitely hooked now and will go back. Nice charging station for your electronics is an added bonus.

I have been following World of Beer one Facebook since they first created a page and started planning.  I have been drinking more craft beer and obscure finds recently and the list of available brands was something I was excited for, even though I knew most would be bottles.   I saw Tuesday was going to be a tapping of SanTan Brewing Co Count Hopula and a perfect day to experience the bar for my first time. I liked the location - right on Mill. The beer selection is obviously excellent and I would say among the best in Phoenix. Yardhouse has more on tap, but considering taps & bottles I don't know that anyone surpasses WOB. The building was cool too - an old bank with a brick interior, the bank vault, etc.  They don't serve food, which for me is actually a positive. That means people likely won't be hanging around all night - come in for a couple of drinks and go. I didn't mind the price of the beer. I had the Count Hopula on draught for $5.50. Bottles ranged from $5 to one I saw that was $15, but then again it's not your daddy's ole Natty Light and considering Tilted Kilt is $6 for a draught, it's not bad.   I did end up paying the $15 for a loyalty card. If you plan on going only once or twice it's probably not worth it. If you think you will go frequently to occasionally, why not get it? It's good for 25% off bottles on Tuesday and it is a one-time fee.  Having the card also tracks your drinking habits in the system so you can earn rewards and if you download the handy app for free you can see your progress as well as research new beers to try. Following the Count Hopula I went to bottles to enjoy the 25% off. I started with the Samichalus Helles at 14% alc. I fellow patron who was well informed on beer suggested it and gave me a background story on it. I wouldn't recommend more than one.... A Black Sheep Holy Grail and a Papago Orange Blossom and I called it a night.   The bartenders were plentiful and always busy. Each was very knowledgeable and the guy who told me about the Samichalus told me about their required training. There was only one waitress and she was overwhelmed as they were apparently one waitress short - but I prefer to sit at the bar.  The one negative about everything was the seating. It is a small location. There are several seats at the bar, but those fill up quickly. There are a few long tables, a few small tables in the main area, a back room, and a front room, but again, it was small. Arriving at 4pm on Tuesday I initially was already standing until someone left the bar about 10 minutes later. I can't imagine what it will be like when school is in session, during football games, or any given weekend.  There is an upstairs area, but that is where live music is played. Fortunately for me there was no live music at the time. I like going to concerts and enjoy music, but typically do not like live music when I am going to a bar or restaurant.  Overall everything was positive for me and I will definitely be back...but likely during the late afternoon before the crowds start appearing.

I wanted to try this brewery because I saw it on Untappd. I live in Mesa and didn't realize it was there, but in seeing the check-in I sought it out. The person checked in with a Russian Imperial Stout, and that is one of my favorites. There is street parking that is not too far away. I entered and sat at a table - no one came to help. After about 10 minutes a spot at the bar opened up and I moved to that seat. Even then it took a few minutes for someone to come by - and there were 3 people behind the bar. I finally ordered the Imperial Russian Stout and I had to take a few sips because I was surprised - surprised that something so dark and rich had absolutely no flavor. It really didn't taste like anything I have had. None the less I finished it and ordered a second drink. I ordered the Buzz Bomb - an IPA, which is another favorite of mine. Again I was surprised because it didn't have a taste. As I checked in on my Untapped app I noticed that someone else commented that it was underwhelming and didn't have a taste. It was nice to know that I wasn't crazy. I did like supporting a local brewery, but  I tried it and I don't have to come back. If I do I will try something I haven't had, because what I did have was unimpressive.

I have been here before, and it is better than the predecessor, but I was a little disappointed in my visit. A friend of mine sent me an email about an event for the Prohibition Repeal anniversary. I was impressed with the ad - the bar had a nice ad for the night, created 3 special cocktails to celebrate, and suggested visitors dress the part. I showed up and there was a good number of people, but none of the customers were really dressed up. The staff was somewhat dressed. I had a male bartender and he was in a white shirt with black tie. That could be 1920s, but it could be any day also. The female bartender had an outfit and looked the part. Other than that, it didn't really live up to the hype. I had a Batch 19 beer, but that was it. There was good hype for the event, but I didn't think it lived up to it. When I go to Tempe Marketplace this is not usually my first choice, so this visit didn't really do anything to change my mind.

I have drive past this place many times, but I am a fan of barbecue and decided to give it a try. The set-up is nice: they have full service or an order and pick up section. I didn't know what I wanted so I went with a combo platter and took the two meat selection. I selected the pork and the chicken. Two sides were the mac and cheese and cowboy beans. I topped it off with a Kilt Lifter, which I was pleasantly surprised to see arrive in a short mason jar. I was also surprised with the cowboy beans. I was expected baked beans, but instead it was like baked beans in chili. It was good - but even better was the mac and cheese. Yum! The pork was good. I enjoyed it and ate all of it, but the chicken was the real star. If I had known it was like that I would have only ordered the chicken. I was maybe the best I have had. I will definitely be back and while I feel like I should try other things, I think I might stick with the chicken..

I love this truck. I have had it 3 times now. It has come down in Tempe to World of Beer and now is coming to my work. Expect about $10 for a sandwich, 1/2 order of tots, drink, and ketchup. Two of the times I have had the buffalo chicken with blue cheese. The other was the mac and cheese with rib (fully loaded). Both are excellent. The tots are great, especially with the bloody mary ketchup dipping sauce. I definitely recommend this one!

This was my first time here and it was much larger than I was expecting. A good number of beers on tap, all of them brewed there. Plenty of seats at the bar and a large, open room with several tables. I would recommend a flight of 6 or 8 because they have so a large selection. I started with a stout and it was excellent. It was the winner of the first annual Brewer's Ball put on by Badwater Brewing this year. Second, I have a dirty blonde - which was also excellent. While there I was able to sample a few other beers and I would have been happy with any of them. Additionally, I ordered the fish and chips - three nice short and fat pieces of fish, thin french fries and very good. Plus the staff was incredibly friendly and I enjoyed talking with them. Definitely check out this place if you are on that side of town.

I tried this salon recently, mainly because I drive past it and it didn't look too busy. I made an appointment for the following weekend morning and was able to sit down after she finished up with one guy. Good thing I made an appointment because six other guys walked in during my time there. It was $20 for a haircut, but that included a shampoo. They offer a full line of services and seem to have a strong focus on shaving and shaving products. I did not partake in that, but maybe next time. The haircut was quick (I dont have much hair), but looked great. I will definitely use this one again.

The club was likely okay, but it reminded me of how old I am. I bought two tickets to see Ice Cube, which I was reluctant to do because it was a Sunday night and I work early. But the ticket said the hours of operation on Sunday was 8pm - 12 am. I thought it seemed short, but I reviewed the club's Facebook page and the same information was shown. Accepting the information as accurate, I thought Ice Cube would probably come on around 9:30 or 10, play for an hour, and then end. As I was getting ready to leave I again consulted the ticket and found a dress code that stated no hats, t-shirts, shorts, or sneakers. So I dressed accordingly.  We arrived at the club about 8:20 and the line was stretched down the sidewalk. No one entered yet. I get the false creation of a line so that it looks very busy and causing people driving by to want to stop and see what's happening. But it was chill and I knew I would be tired by the end of the night. Plus most of the people in line were middle aged white people, so they were just as old and just as tired as me. Finally we get in about 8:45. A DJ is playing and people are mostly just standing around. It was spacious with two VIP sections surrounding a dance area. We stood on behind the VIP on the ramp, but eventually security told us to move because it was going to be crowded. It wasn't crowded yet. I attempted to order a drink - my wife likes Smirnoff Ice. They didn't have it. She asked for a pina colada, but they couldn't make it. I said just make me something of whatever you can make and ended up with some watermelon cocktail that was okay. I ordered a coke, and it was $10 for two drinks. That's not too bad.  We went back to waiting. Apparently there were multiple DJs. I honestly couldn't tell because it all sounded the same to me. Most people were just standing around, but a few were dancing. My thought was why pay to go to a club to listen to some guy play songs on the computer when I could do that at home or in my car? But again, I am old. 9:30 came and went, as did 10, and 10:30. No Ice Cube. I was thinking it doesn't leave much time if they close by 12. Next a large crowd of people came in and filled the VIP areas and dance floor. I thought now we are getting somewhere, but time marched on. I scanned the crowd and noticed at least 20 dudes wearing caps, t-shirts, and sneakers. Getting frustrated, I asked the security guy what time the show was going to start. He said by 12, to which I asked curiously I thought they closed at 12. He said no, it is actually 2...despite the ticket and the Facebook page saying otherwise. Then again the dress code apparently is just a suggestion too. I started calculating in my head - 12 o'clock to start, probably play for an hour..that's 1...then drive home, probably 1:45 and then 2 before I got to bed. Getting up at 5 would really suck. I have wanted to see Ice Cube for a while - I was an original member in the Lynch Mob fan club...but alas work called, and said screw it, and we left at 11:15 with no Ice Cube.   I am not sure why information such as hours of operation and dress codes are printed on tickets if they are not accurate. It sucked that I didn't get to see Ice Cube, but I guess $40 to realize the club scene is well behind me was money well spent.

It seems like all of my reviews are bars and breweries lately.  Huss is a local brewery that that opened in August 2013. I have had some of the beers around down at local bars. The Rice Pudding is typically a hit, the Sunday Funday, the Southern Hussy, and the That'll Do! IPA are all good. Magic in the Ivy is named for the Chicago Cubs and I enjoyed that one too. I finally set out to find the source and visit the brewery recently. It is located in a building that used to be Rio Salado Brewery. It is described as South Tempe, but it is tucked away down a side street off Priest Road and just a street or two away from Guadalupe.   The bar area is small. There were a only a few seats at the bar, but there were some tables elsewhere. Still, on a weekend or a release day I imagine seating will be very challenging. I went specifically to try the Rise of the Rio, a Schwarzbier  that was made to pay homage to Rio Salado Brewing which specialized in the style (and as I mentioned previously operated from the building). It was excellent and I definitely recommend it. I noticed also on tap was a barrel-aged Snowbird Imperial Stout. That was exceptional. Nice bourbon smell, but not over powering. Definitely smooth. Both beers totaled $13. I definitely plan on returning soon and getting a growler of the Snowbird ($22) before it is gone.  Definitely check this place out and support the local breweries.

This is an excellent new brewery in town, and recently has won multiple awards stating that same fact. This one is only about 3 miles from my home. They have good food and great beer. I have tried every beer they have and I have not discovered one that I did not like. The parking lot is ample and the staff is friendly. A lot of tables inside, a good size bar, an island in the idle, and a very nice patio. If you want a good beer, and to support a local brewery, give this a try.

Nice addition to the GCU campus. Newly opened Chick-Fil-A express offers a few limited selections. A regular or grilled sandwich, a salad, fries, and drinks. No lemons for the tea, but otherwise okay. Several registers open helps the line move, but with 8500 students living on campus still expect a wait. A sandwich with cheese, medium fries, and large beverage for $6.33. Cheese available in American or Pepper Jack.

St. Patrick's Day and after a day of work and night at the gym I wanted to go out and get an order of corned beef & cabbage and a Guinness. After two failed attempts at other establishments (one $10 per person to get in and the second closed the kitchen at 8) I called O'Brien's. I was impressed that they answered the phone, it sounded quiet in the background, and their kitchen was open until 12.   It is right behind the Fiesta Mall and had plenty of parking. When I walked in it was spacious and although there were several people it was not too busy - and it was quiet. We sat down at 9:20 in the bar area. There was a guy cleaning tables beside us and two servers that walked by multiple times. The hostess came in, gave someone a menu, and left. We still waited.   I looked at everyone as they waited on surrounding tables or walked by, yet we went unacknowledged. I stopped someone and asked if we could get a minute. We finally received one and it was some minutes before the server came to our table. When she did she said "oh wait - let me get some paper to write down your order". She returned quickly and wrote down the corned beef & cabbage, a Guinness, and lemonade.   We waited, and waited, and waited some more. I was growing increasingly impatient. I saw her occasionally walking around, yet we still had no drink. 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes. Still no drink. I understand the food would take longer, but the drinks? I looked at their clock and it said 8:57. I stopped a different server walking by told her I was five minutes from walking out. She asked why and I informed her we still didn't have drinks.   A guy came up, apologized and I said whatever - I am leaving in three minutes. He asked what we ordered. I said apparently a time consuming lemonade and Guinness because we can't seem to get one in under a half hour. He looked shocked and asked what food we ordered. He apologized and said he would check on it. I reminded him he was down to two minutes and I didn't care what he did with it.   He did hustle and brought the lemonade and Guinness, and apologized. Then he went into the back and immediately returned with a plate of corned beef and cabbage. We had also at some point added mozzarella sticks and he returned a couple of minutes later with those. Our original server came by and she said "oh, sorry" and asked if she could get anything else for us. I said how about a second set of silverware. She said okay, but we never did see that surface.   Another server stopped by, apologized and said "there have been a lot of mix-ups tonight". She said the manager would stop by and talk to us, but he was with someone else right now. The helpful male server stopped by again to see if we needed anything, and the manager showed up at the same time. He dropped off another Guinness and lemonade that must have been from the kid's menu. I told him I didn't think I would drink that other beer. He said "try", then he walked the male server to the side and asked where we came from....meaning whose table did he take over. Then he said something about taking the food and someone had been waiting for something for a long time - it sounded like he was getting in trouble for helping out. Maybe he took someone else's food. I don't know what their story was, and sorry I we ate your food.   The manager never did speak to us other than giving us the free drinks we didn't want. They did not take anything off the bill - the corned beef, the cheese sticks, lemonade, and Guinness came to $26.45. We also never received the second set of silverware.   I understand it is St. Patrick's Day and most places are crazy busy. This was not that busy and had sufficient staff coverage. For an Irish bar this is your Black Friday. You have one day that you are really busy and need to be at the top of your game. This was far from it. The food was good, but the service (except for the one guy who eventually got talked to) was horrible. It was slow and I was getting annoyed before it really was slow and I was annoyed. It should not take that long to get a menu, and then drinks should be immediate - not 40 minutes.   I appreciate the server who tried to help, even if he got in trouble. Even though the food was good, I will never go back to that business. If someone were to take my dead body and put it in the restaurant I would turn into a zombie if nothing more than to walk out of there.

The Perch is a nice spot in Chandler to grab some local craft beer and some good food. They have a few of their own beers, but have a good selection of other beers as well. You can follow their beer menu on Taphunter, which is usually when I decide to visit. They have a 4 oz flight glass for $2 so it is cheap to try new thinks. The pint is usually around $5. I have had some of the pizzas too, and I highly recommend those.  I usually end up taking half of it home with me.  One of the big features of the brewery is the outdoor seating. There is a nice courtyard with plenty of seating (and plenty of birds in cages), there is a large bar downstairs, and there is another bar with ample outdoor seating upstairs. The key is to always go to the hostess and be seated. The sign says see hostess for seating in the tables, but it isn't really clear about sitting at the bar. See the hostess for that too because if you just walk in and sit down it is not very likely you will be seen and get a menu or drink any time soon.

As it turns out, there are two Margaret G. Hance Parks...this address is for one of them, but the other is at E. Moreland, just down the road. I attended the Old World Oktoberfest held at the Moreland end of the park. Parking was not too difficult - lots across the street for $5 or parking on the street for free. The park provided a good location for the festival and allowed each vendor plenty of room, as well as an area for a dance floor and the main stage.  The pros of the festival: the AZ Accordian band, Guggenbach Band & Lorelei & Schatzi. I also stayed for the Beer Stein Competition. There were several vendors there including Grandma Goes Nuts (which offered good cinnamon covered peacans, almonds and cashews), the San Francisco Chocolate Factory (carmel, chocolate and candy covered apples), a funnel cake place, a curly fry place, Der kaffee Kuchen (brats & kraut!) and of course a few tables of Warsteiner. I had three boots of the Oktoberfest blend.   The atmosphere was great, the entertainment was awesome and I enjoyed the beer, brats & funnel cake...  A few things I wish would have been better: more of a crowd. Granted the festival started at 10 AM...I stayed from about 11-2, but there were not many people...also, how cool would it have been if a vendor were selling German items such as lederhosen? This was the 4th annual and I think they are on the right track. Maybe a few more vendors and some community support would make it a 5 star event....

A nice little place now, but growing. They have been open about 6-7 months, but today was the only the second weekend that they were open for lunch. They have three Bad Water beers: IPA (draft), Saison (bottle), and Lager (bottle). But estimation is the saison will be on draft next week and the lager soon to follow. I had the saison and it was really good. The IPA was a bit lighter in color than I expected, but it tasted good. It was a quiet place today because not many know about lunch, but I imagine evenings and weekends it will be busy. There are only a small number of seats, so get there earl.

Tonight was the VIP opening night for the new location. This location is a little smaller than the Tempe one, as there is no upstairs. There is a nice patio and there is good seating inside. It also has a stage for the live music.   The format is the same - more than 500 beers in the bottle, and this one has 5 more taps than Tempe. The coolers are blacked out and has LED lighting which gives a better look and more visibility. The other location has fluorescent lighting in the coolers. Another plus is this one has a cask cooler so in times like tonight when there was a cask (Sonoran White Chocolate case with Peppermint - very nice), the cask fits in the cooler and customers can see it.   Another big plus for me is the parking. The bar is located in the mall so parking is free and it is plentiful. In Tempe it is difficult and becoming even more challenging to find parking. When parking is there it costs at least $3 per 2 hours.   Having been to the Tempe location from the beginning, I know Gilbert will be very crowded for several months. It is new and the clientele will be different. Unlike when Tempe started this one will already have craft spirits and food (the loaded tater tots are excellent).   I likely will go to both locations. Gilbert is closer to where I live, and the parking at Tempe makes Gilbert a desirable choice.

This was the best pizza in Chandler. The guys working were very helpful, and even remembered our names the entire time we were there. We had pizza, wings, and a calzone for our large family, and when we left about an hour later they called us by name and said good night. The pizza slice special I have had on carry out before and it is a huge slice, wings, and a drink for about $7. Any time I want pizza from now on, this is where I will go.

A brand new brewery opened in town recently. I saw some check ins on Untappd and remember seeing the construction a couple of months ago. I stopped in on my way home from work and it was not busy - only a couple of customers.   The building was very spacious and had a nice exposed brick that gave it a cool warehouse feel. The bar had plenty of seating and there were tables that should give the brewery plenty of room on what I imagine will be busy weekends. Just down the street from Chase Field and US Airways it is in a great location to pick up pre and post-game drinks.  They have four of their own beers:  Mother's Gose, Aramis Pale, Oatmeal Stout, and the Cherry Popper. I had a flight of the four, and each was good. The Aramis had a hint or orange and the cherry was not overpowering in the Cherry Popper. They also have a nice selection of local beers from Huss, College Street, Papago, Grand Canyon, San Tan, Dragoon, Sonoran, and Lumberyard. It was a nice surprise to also see Ninkasi on tap because it is new to Arizona distribution just in the last couple of weeks. I was also impressed by the prices. All beers were the same price! 4 oz flight class $2, 10 oz $6, 16 oz $8, and a 32oz growler for $10. Say what? $10?  It was a nice place and I am glad to see another location for good local craft beer. They have food too, but I didn't check that out this visit. Next time!

I attended an open house for this newly opened banquet hall. I was looking ahead for location to hold my step-daughter's quinceanera. This place is not far from our home and being new, I wanted to check it out. From the outside I wasn't expecting much. It is a shopping center next to the Laser Tag place - but walking in I was pleasantly surprised. The space was very large, had a small separate room for kids to play and watch TV if they get bored, there is a separate kitchen, and a separate room & bathroom that could be used as a changing room for the quinceanera.   They offered three different packages that included the space and food, on up to the top package that included the space, food for 300 guests, DJ, video & Photo, limousine service, upgraded decorations, and other amenities. The sound system was good and included some effects such as strobe lights and fog. There are three different food plates to choose from - Mexican,  Pasta with chipotle sauce, and pasta with Alfredo sauce. I tried the chipotle sauce and it was good. It came with 2-3 sides. They had different varieties of cake to choose from as well. The packages had one price level for Saturday and a significantly lower price for Friday or Sunday. For the open house they were offering $1500 discount for booking that day (by putting down a $500 deposit). We were all impressed with the location and ended up booking that day.I really liked that it was new and large. The guy I spoke with said they have had a couple of events there during construction, but so far none with the fully constructed hall. It is a good location and priced well compared to others.

I have been hearing good things about this place and finally had the opportunity to stop by. It is a small place, only open a few months, but they have a nice thing going. I went to try their brewed beers, even though they have a good rotation of guest beers also.   I ordered a flight of four beers, but then saw they had five home brews so the Belgian Tickler became a full sized. That was an excellent beer; a collaboration for College Street. The Vanilla Porter was good, War Paint Red IPA also good, and so was the Lolli. My favorite was the Saison D'hiver - one of the best saisons I have tried.  I did not have the food, but I saw others around me getting it and everything looked awesome. I will go back to try the food. The beer is excellent and the prices are very good. I had the flight and the snifter of the Belgian for under $10 with happy hour.

I found this place by having a coupon. Dropped off my two dogs and they did a great job with their haircuts. It is a bit of a drive for me, but I will use them again. In fact, it's time for another trim so I will call them now!

Last weekend I purchased a costume for Halloween - two weeks before the holiday. Around 8 pm the store was not crowded. As I checked out the cashier was busy on her cellphone, but stopped to ring me up. When I got home I was disappointed to find the costume didn't fit. No problem, I will go back and trade it for something else. The next day I went to another location closer to my house. When I asked to return it the cashier said there are no returns. He said that should have been explained when I purchased the costume. It was not as the busy cellphone cashier didn't even talk other than to tell me the total price. However, he said they could exchange it if I found something in the story. I looked, but nothing really interested me. I asked if I could still exchange it later and perhaps my step-kids could use the credit to buy costumes for them. He said no problem, but did point out it would have to be at least equal value because they would not give any money back.   Yesterday I attempted to complete the exchange. There was a costume my step-daughter wanted, but they did not have all of it. We were told we needed to get it all there because the exchange had to be more than the original sale - so basically spend more money. Since they didn't have all of it we went to another location to exchange.  They did have all of the pieces but when it came time to exchange they said they could not. The costume originally purchased could only be exchanged for the same costume in a different size. Since the costume didn't fit in the first place a different size of the same one would do absolutely nothing. So basically I am out the $60. Thanks for nothing, Spirit. Maybe work on training your employees to provide adequate and consistent messages since the return policy seems to change at each location.   One thing is certain, even though I have purchased on previous occasions, I will not purchase anything from Spirit ever again.

I never knew this place was there until a friend mentioned it to me. Cool warehouse feel - shops, restaurant, and a bar in the back. Management and staff were very helpful. I like the brown bag special for $2 where the beer inside is a mystery. I will definitely stop back and spend more time!

Um, no thanks. Never again. Took my stepson here recently. We waited for 40 minutes in the lobby, then when we got inside it was another 40 minutes for the doctor to arrive. When we first arrived we asked the lady at the desk how much the co-payment was and handed her our insurance card. My wife thought it was urgent care, but it is not. The desk lady said "I don't know. I have to see in the system after you are done." We showed her the card upfront to make sure it was the urgent care copay, but again she didn't give an answer. She only said "I don't know. Do you want the doctor to see him?" After we said yes and had the long wait the doctor said he could not give him anything other than what his regular doctor has already given which wasn't helping. He told him since he was having severe cramps go drink some prune juice. When we went back to the desk the desk lady said "Your balance is $500".  When we questioned her she said we are an emergency room like the hospital. If she knew that, she could have answered the question about the cost before going in. We tasted a lot of time and $500 for no medical advice.   Unless you are dying, go somewhere else. The name "Dignity" does not seem to model how they conduct business. These clowns are only interested in money and skirting the fringe of insurance fraud.
