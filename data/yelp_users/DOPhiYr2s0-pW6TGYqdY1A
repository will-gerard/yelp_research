Stacie is awesome!  She's been doing my hair for over ten years, and I'll continue to go to The Urge for Stacie's great work and hair style expertise. Thanks Stacie!

My AC went out - I called Day & Night at 8:30pm and had a technician at my place an hour later. Kasey, the technician, was very nice, professional, and arrived in a Day & Night van (not subcontracted). Would recommend to anyone needing after business hour service calls!

Zero stars. Overpriced and wretched food. I ordered the $27 seabass and I was served a previously frozen, dried out hockey puck that resembled TV dinner fish. Sent it back and got the $18 canned Campbell's stew...errr I mean....the short ribs stew. Awful. The appetizer was the 'world famous' pretzel fondue which you could order from any TGI Friday's or Chili's for a few bucks less. I'll never go there again. I'm usually not this hostile in my reviews but these guys should be ashamed of themselves for their menu prices..
