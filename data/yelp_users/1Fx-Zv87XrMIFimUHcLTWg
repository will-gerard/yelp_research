Everything I've had so far has been delicious, I especially love the smothered burritos. The back patio has a great atmosphere!

Dale has tinted the windows on my five of my vehicles over the past 12 years. I've never had any issues with bubbling or fading. Would definitely recommend and have in the past.

I posted a picture of an "Apple" from my most recent trip to Panera...I've had consistently poor food from this location. I have eaten at Panera's nationwide and usually have a good experience. I've been to this location by my house half a dozen times and always left underwhelmed. Slow service and mediocre food.

Cool new restaurant spot.  Menu is better food than you would expect from your average sports bar, so it's really much more than just that.  Great selection of sandwiches, burgers, appetizers, salads, pizza, stromboli and pastas.  1 star.  They also have great vegetarian options for pretty much everything on the menu which you don't find often.  2 stars.  Great microbrew selection on tap.  3 stars.  Awesome feel and atmosphere, with photos from the outdoors, traveling and adventure sports everywhere.  Decor has a modern clean mix of wood, concrete, river rock, aspen and an interior bike rack for your ride.  4 stars.  Great service, odds are the GM Justin will stop by your table to make sure you've had a great experience.  5 STARS!
