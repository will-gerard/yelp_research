I go to Ken's regularly. Ken and Amy are awesome, funny and good at what they do! I have never left that place unhappy. They have decent prices, lots of employees and practice good business. I always check my nails before I leave, if there is ever ANYTHING wrong with them (there never really is) they are always more than happy to fix it. One time I noticed a certain color was still a little transparent after two coats, I asked for a third and without hesitation they applied another. All of the technicians I have had were skilled and able to produce anything I ask for. I have seen women next to me with very beautiful art as well! I highly recommend this place.

Yet another amazing experience at Blue Hound! I always love going there for their ambiance and creative menu items. Not only is the place great to look at, but my server was too! Chris W was very attentive and knowledgable, especially with the cocktails. I started with the Lawless, then went to the Young and Famous and finished with an excellent old fashioned. For dinner I had the scallops which were so perfectly seared, paired with the most perfect sauce!   I heard the shishito peppers are good, I'll be coming back to try those! Thank you for the excellent service and food!

The Madison has been my absolute FAVORITE place to do yoga for a very long time. I move around a lot, but I always find myself wanting to come back to this place. It also has my two favorite teachers of all time; Alex Austin and Anton Mackey. Nothing gets me going more than a good flow taught by one of those guys in the morning! They have excellent taste in music, which makes the class that much better! I am definately a customer for life!

Let me just start off by saying that the place is absolutely beautiful! I love how they put their own twist to the old church! The place was packed during lunch time, but our server was still attentive and friendly. I got the trio tacos with street corn. A skirt steak taco I think- it was ok, the chicken taco- it was good and the veggie taco- phenomenal! So was the street corn! It was all really messy to eat and I probably looked like I was eating like as 2 year old, but I didn't care. I will definitely be going back for happy hour. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the salsa wasn't very impressive. I mean, I still ate it and everything, but it needed something.. I think a taco place should always have amazing salsa.

Very friendly and helpful staff! They fixed my screen quickly. Although $97 is a bit expensive, it was cheaper than replacing my phone since I don't have insurance. They also threw in a free tempered glass screen protector with the repair. And they don't tell you this, but you get 10% off of any case with a repair! Not much savings, but with the case and tempered glass and repair all together, it felt like a steal. Did I mention how friendly and helpful the staff is? I feel like that is worth mentioning twice. Definitely recommend this place if you need a screen repair!

What an experience! Let me start off by mentioning how cute the place is inside. The decor is really sheek and elegant with table cloths and big open windows. And then there's the food.... I got edamame, firecracker jalapeños and the mexican roll. I like spicy food and the sushi chef was more than happy to accommodate. He also told me he could do any traditional roll as well, but im not a traditional type of person so I went with a specialty roll. His roll was beautifully put together with a nice presentation. The firecracker jalapeños were excellent! Whole jalapeños cut in fourths and deep fried with cream cheese with a very nice sauce served on top (and not too much). On the side I was given an excellent mixed ponzu sauce that went great with everything!  My waiter was very attentive and pleasant! Not one complaint with the service! The owner was behind the bar and very friendly as well. Overall it was a great choice to eat!

I've been to the CPR in scottsdale at the Talking Stick shopping plaza (and wrote a review for it as well) and I was blown away by the service. This location? Not so much. I took a galaxy s5 in for a screen repair. IT WAS $225!!!!!!!! My iPhone costed $97 last time. The guy at the counter said it would be about 40 minutes to an hour, so I went to the sushi place next door. He called me about an hour later to ask me if I had problems with my home button and I said no. He then told me he was trying to fix it and it would be another 30-40 minutes and that he would call me when it's done. 40 minutes go by and it's 7PM. I realized they close at 7PM so I closed out my check and walked over. It was 7:05 EXACTLY and the door was locked. I knocked on the door several times pretty loud and no answer. No answer on the phone either. I finally called the next day to see what had happened and they just simply told me yes, the phone was ready. I was pretty upset at this point because I didn't have a car and didn't live in downtown. I just happened to be in the area so I fixed my phone there. It was VERY inconvenient to have to find a ride to central PHX to pick up my phone. Especially since I was traveling that day and had to be at the airport. I asked the gentleman at the counter why I didn't get a call when it was ready and all he could say was "I called you earlier and said it would be 30-40 mins." I was expecting a call when it was FINISHED so I didn't have to wait in the empty, bland store. All I got was a sorry. The last place gave me a free tempered glass screen protector. I gave it 2 because the screen did get fixed, but for a very hefty price and terrible customer service.
