The pizza at Enzo's was very delicious!!! I went with 2 other people and we got a large pizza, garlic knots and an order of wings for $20.00. That was a great deal! The owner was extremely nice and very friendly! I liked the feeling of being in a place that was family owned. The son came just after we got our food and made sure our drinks were filled and that we were doing okay. I would highly recommend this place if you love good tasting pizza and a cozy environment.

I like the fact that this place delivers, however the food is just okay. I ordered chicken friend rice, which was really good. The Pad Thai tasted weird and had this sweet flavor that didn't make it appetizing one bit! I've only eaten here once, but it didn't really make a great impression.  Not sure if I would go here again.

I didn't like Osaka at all! Service was horrible, we had to ask the waitress twice to get our drinks and the shrimp and fish weren't fresh.  I also didn't like that they do not have AYCE.   Our rolls were okay, I would never go here again!!!

This place was recommended to me by a great friend. I am not one to choose Asian food for a meal.  I've tried different Chinese & Thai food restaurants, but I leave un satisfied and not very impressed!  Kung Ku has yet to disappointment me! The food is very flavorful and I have yet to not like something I've ordered.    The food is served family style and the prices are reasonable!  You won't find yourself waiting long either because the food comes out fast!    If you're in the area, give it try!

One of the best AYCE Sushi places I've ever been to!  The restaurant is small, but you know it's good because people will wait up to an hour to eat some sushi!   The AYCE menu is big and it includes dessert as well!  You have to try the seafood salad, get spicy!  The flavor is amazing and it has a fresh taste that leaves you completely satisfied.    As far as rolls go I would recommend the Man Whore (this one has cooked salmon),    Whenever I leave Yama I literally feel like I gained 10 pounds from eating so much delicious sushi.  The fish is very fresh and the rolls come out very quickly!   Whether you're a Vegas local or a tourist, this place is a must!

This hotel is in need of a MAKEOVER!!! The rooms have blue carpet, like that of my 85 year old grandmothers house! The decor looks way outdated and the furniture looks like it came from a garage sale!  My cousins stayed here and I came to see their hotel room. They came to Vegas to not only have fun but relax, not at the Paris you don't! The beds in this hotel are hard as a ROCK!!!!! The pillows are the same quality as those you get on an international flight! Small, cheap and lumpy! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone!  I feel so bad my family members stayed here. I told them to talk to me next time they want to book a hotel, so I can steer them clear of duds like this one!

Let me start off by saying that Kahunaville definitely exceeded my expectations!!!!!    My boyfriend purchased the Groupon for this restaurant,so we gave it a try.  The service was great, restaurant is clean and the ambiance is fun.  I ordered the New York Strip steak with cream cheese chive mashed potatoes and vegetables.   My meal also came with a caesar salad, which was served to me before I received the main entree.  I also ordered my steak medium rare, and it was cooked to PERFECTION!!  This was impressive because a lot of places end up over cooking steaks.  My boyfriend ordered the steak stir fry, which was also very good!  The potions were huge, and the presentation of the food was lovely!    Most items on the menu were fairly priced.  I live here in Vegas, so I know that anytime you eat on the strip your meal is going to be a bit pricey!  The drink menu is huge, but due to a long night of drinking the night before, water is all we wanted that night.  For dessert we shared a fried waffle, which was delicious! It was served with a very rich vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream.  Overall I was impressed and I left a very happy customer!  I will definitely be eating at Kahunaville again!   I'm sad I didn't give it a try sooner!  It would also be a fun place to come if you have people come to town and you want to take them to a fun place!  They have live music nightly as well!

I've been to Yard House many times and I've always liked everything I've ordered. There isn't one particular item I would recommend but I would suggest their happy hour! Lots of great things on the menu for a reasonable price.    I've always had great service at all locations I've visited.   Restaurant has low lighting, so if you like a  bright place, Yard House isn't for you.

Tried the AYCE for the first time last week with a friend. Trying a new sushi place is always scary, but Blue Fin didn't disappoint!   They Cajun albacore nigri was my favorite nigri on the menu. I also enjoyed the super white tuna! Fresh and full of flavor!  As far as rolls go, they have a very diverse selection.  One of my favorite rolls was the "Sunset" roll. The service was great and I liked that the place was small and cozy! I would recommend this place to all sushi lovers! I will definitely be eating here again!

I was excited to try a new place on the strip! I had friends come in from out of town and this place came to mind. I have seen it many times while playing tourist. It was always pretty busy, so I thought, let's give it a try.  I ordered the chili cheese burger with fries. 2 of my friends got the burger that had fried pickles and my other friend had the club.  The food came out quick and presentation was fine.   The burgers weren't huge, but enough for one person. My burger was just okay. Nothing impressive. The fries on the other hand were very tasty! Prices on the menu were average for a place on the strip.    I won't be going back to this place.  Service was great, but the food is nothing to write home about. There are a lot more places on the strip that are 10 times better.

I had been wanting to try Smashburger! Many of my friends raved about this place and said I had to try it!   I ordered the Baja Smashburger, it was  tasty and had just the right amount of  spice. I love jalape√±os on my burger. The bun on this burger also had a kick to it, and made the burger that much more tasty!   I would also recommend the Smash fries! They had such a good flavor and I found myself devouring them!!!  My visit was satisfying and I would eat here again!

Who doesn't like BJ's? Their diverse menu offers something for everyone!  If your a pizza lover, their Chicago style pizza is a must!  The crust is thick and flavorful!  My 2 favorite specialty pizzas they offer are The Great White and the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  If you order a large, it's great for sharing with a small group of people.  If you can't decide on which pizza to order, get half of one thing and half of something else!  Yes, they will do that at no extra charge!  Their alcoholic drinks are all very tasty, but for those who aren't big on alcoholic drinks , give the root beer a try!  They make the root beer there and you'll definitely be requesting a refill.    If you're a sweets person like myself, you have to get a pizookie to end your meal!  My personal favorite is the Oreo.  A pizookie is the most delicious, moist, flavorful cookie served warm with vanilla ice cram on top!

This is literally the best taco truck I've ever had! I came to visit a friend in Phoenix and we went here after a night of fun at Charlie's. Not only is the food amazing and full of flavor, but it's beyond reasonable. Tacos are only a $1.00 and oI don't remember anything being over $7.00. It was so good I went here twice during my visit to Phoenix. I tried the carne asada tacos, super nachos with asada, mini quesadilla with chicken and another one with carne asada. I think the quesadilla tastes best with asada.   If you love authentic Mexican food, you must try Taqueria Los Yaquis!
