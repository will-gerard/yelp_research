I headed over here today because 1) it was close to the house 2) They are open on a Sunday 3) I'm giving birth soon and NEEDED a pampering pedicure  This place is next to the Basha's and is pretty no frills.  They have the standard massage chairs and mine worded just fine.  Water was the right temperature.  The lady doing my pedicure asked if I wanted them trimmed short which is exactly what I needed since I don't know when I would be  back.  Pretty typical pedicure.  They do use a salt scrub briefly which is included in the price of the pedicure.  She filed my nails and scrubbed my feet well.  The foot and leg massage lasted a good amount of time and didn't seem rushed at all.  Polish was nice and even and looked like any pedicure I've gotten elsewhere.  I got just regular polish no design and the cost was $20 bucks.  There really wasn't much of a difference between this pedicure and ones I've gotten at "higher end" salons except for maybe having more options to customize your pedicure at other places.  Regardless, I would go back.  It's close, inexpensive and they do a good job.   I figure it will make a quick "momma time" escape once the baby gets here.

We like this place because it is right down the road from our apartment and works well as a meeting place for friends.  The best part is they have both Vegan and Gluten Free options.  This makes it great for when we want to gather with our closest friends who run fall all over the food spectrum.    The pizza is good.  I'm from Chicago so I'm picky about my pizza as nothing is ever as good as my home town staple.  But I enjoy this place.  The crust is good, not too dry and airy.  The only thing I don't like is that their thin crust is not a true thin crust in my eyes.  I like crispy thin crust but it is still a good crust.  The pizza was not oily or greasy at all.  We've had pepperoni,  sausage, and ham and pineapple on our pizza.  My boyfriend has had the wings and they smelled good to me and appeared to taste good as he polished them off.  We've had their pizza dine in and carry out and really have no complaints.  My only other dislike is that the pizza is not as good the next morning.  Yes I judge pizza based on it's taste as cold leftovers.  But, I love cold pizza so this is a huge scoring point for me.  It's a great little neighborhood spot that we will continue to visit.

Wow! I could probably justify this review with just simple "Wow" and be done with it.  But I am not a woman of few words so I'll elaborate.  I went here on Friday night with 3 of my friends, one of whom is in a wheelchair.  If you don't know where to find the door you will walk right past it.   It truly has that old speakeasy feel of yesteryear.  Once you walk is that feeling continues with the low lighting, comfy couches, and set up in general.  Yes there were Christmas decorations up, but it's Christmas in July. NO BIG DEAL.  We were promptly seated upfront where the band was setting up.  The wait staff were extremely accommodating to my friend making sure people were out of his way and getting him situated into his place at the table.  At this point, my only complaint was that it was hard to see the menus. But that's what we have flashlight apps for right?  The wine list is in a binder with many options to choose from.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and after we ordered out first glass from the menu we decided just to tell her what we were in the mood for and she would suggest a wine, bring it, and it was fantastic.    For food we started with the antipasto plate which is served with bread.  The cheeses were smooth and buttery.  Prosciutto was perfect along with the serrano ham.  I can't speak for the olives as I hate olives but my friends say they were good.  Next we ordered one of the chef's specialties for the night.  It was a curry, garlic, duck confit, creme fraiche dip served with homemade potato chips.  This dip was AMAZING.  I wanted to spead it on everything.  Between the four of us we darn near licked the bowl clean.  Finally we ordered the three cheese fondue with apples and toasted baguette.  Again you almost had to hold me back from licking the pot clean.  The combination of cheeses with apple and bread was heaven.  The live band they had was also very good that night.  Good mix of music.  The cover is 5$ which originally I scoffed at, but after spending four hours with great friends, music, amazing food, and a spectacular ambiance it was totally worth it.  I will be back and soon.

I have been back several times since my original visit and this place still gets a five star review.  The wine list continues to amaze me every time I go in.  I have gone in with my friend who is in the wheelchair and they continue to be super accommodating in helping us get a table and make our way to the table.  Other customers could use some lessons in manners but that is another story.  Specials continue to rotate in and never disappoint me.  Music is perfect, not too loud and not too quiet.  This is a great intimate spot for first dates or to gather with friends for drinks  The servers continue to be very knowledgeable about the wines they serve and are able to pair the lay terms your use to describe what you like to the perfect wine for you.   Can't wait to get back for another glass of wine.

Scott and his crew have been beyond helpful to me during the last 9 months that I have used them.  Whether it is helping me find the right battery for my truck or doing a bumper to bumper inspection of a used car I bought they have always been accommodating and able to fit me in whether it's a scheduled appointment or an emergency.  Recently they were able to change out the 12v battery on my hybrid after I picked it up from next door and getting accident damage repaired.  During the course of the repair the battery died and they were able to get me in and help me change it out.  Normally I would do it myself but I was 7 months pregnant, recently in an accident, and couldn't lift the battery.  They even checked my check engine light for me but unfortunately it spit out some weird code even they couldn't figure out.  All in all Whitey's has been around since before I was born and has continues to be at the top of their game.  I would highly recommend them to anyone in the area.  I don't mind driving from central Phoenix to have someone I trust work on my car.

I have been a patient of Dr. Sullivan for just over 10 years.  He is extremely thorough and attentive to your needs.  He takes the time to get to know you and listen to what your needs are.  He works extremely hard to make sure you are well taken care of.  He is not afraid to make referrals to specialists if he feels he is not the best to handle your symptoms.  I have always been able to get same day appointments when extremely sick.  When I lost my insurance for 90 days due to a job change he and his staff were very helpful in making sure that I had refills and samples of all the medications that I needed and mad sure that I knew they would help me should I become ill during that time frame.  Sure enough, I came down with a sinus infection and they helped keep my out of pocket costs low.  When I moved to AZ I picked his name out of a book provided by my insurance company and he has been one of the best picks I've made in my life.  Anyone who has accompanied me to an appointment has been impressed with his practice and him as a person.  His wife works in the office from time to time and is extremely pleasant and friendly and his staff remembers me by name anytime I call.  His office is small but clean and well maintained.

This place used to be 5 stars to me.  I used to come here in 2008 when I lived in Scottsdale.  Having just moved to Mesa with no laundry machines in my house I decided to come back.  Maybe today was an off day.  It seemed as if every machine was out of order or had an order ticket on it.  There weren't many people in there but one person had to wait for a washer to be available.  I understand that they also wash people's clothes for them but you would think they would have a handful of machines set aside for the business to use.  I'll give  it one more chance because I had such good experiences before.  Hopefully they won't let me down

I have been coming to Cupz N' Crepes for the last year and absolutely love it. I've come in at various times during their hours. I've come alone to read, to work, and brought friends. The service has always been friendly. It can get crowded on the weekends but it's a small place so it comes with the territory.   I absolutely love The Shirley crepe. Its a crepe filled with cream cheese, Nutella, Strawberries, chocolate sauce and then topped with more chocolate sauce and whipped cream. The strawberries are always fresh and taste amazing. There is a perfect blend of Nutella and Cream Cheese. I have never been a big Nutella fan but something about mixing it with cream cheese makes is heavenly.   I have made my own crepe in which I will usually get chicken, bacon, pesto, lettuce, and cheese. Very good but the sweet crepes have always been more my style.   I've had their blended coffees and iced coffees which really don't taste that much different from any coffee chain place I've been. They do offer Italian sodas which I love (get a raspberry one with whipped creams) it's extremely good.   In all, I really enjoy this place. I would like to come more often on the weekend to be able to work on my side business blogging and running social media. I have never had poor service. Just remember that this a small family run place. They don't have multiple cooks turning out dishes left and right. If it's crowded it may take some time. Just sit back and relax because it is definitely worth it.

Holy Crap!  This place is proof that you do not judge a book by it's cover.  When my boyfriend suggested it for dinner I did some research and was a little scared of the pictures.  But, I figured why the heck not, taco joints are supposed to be divey.  I eat from roadside vendors while in Mexico.  I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and the carne asada quesadilla.  I was tempted to get a fish taco but I decided to hold off until another time.  The tacos were street vendor size.  The meat was tender and delicious and before I knew it they were completely gone and I wish I had ordered three more.  My absolute favorite was the quesadilla.  Cheesy, meaty, warm goodness.  It must have been laced with something illegal because I immediately craved more. I suggest you head there now...well not as I write this as they are closed Sunday and Monday, but as soon as they open again.  Also the owner is not what you would expect.  He's a bald headed white guy with tons of tattoos.  He was extremely friendly and helpful.  Turns out he knows a friend of mine who comes in to eat as well.  Don't blink or you'll miss the place.  But trust me, you need to try it.  You'll thank me.

My boyfriend and I go here often for Ice Cream.  It doesn't matter if it is a hot summer night or a rainy night in Phoenix we will go.  If we can find parking.  The only reason this gets 4 stars is the parking situation.  I know the valet is complimentary but I hate valet.  My car is usually a mess.  It would be nice if all the spots our front were 15 minutes or less.  Regardless, my favorite is the butter pecan ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies.  My boyfriend will change it up every once in a while and order different flavors of ice cream but is pretty dead set on sandwiching it between two chocolate chip cookies.  I love browsing the shelves of nostalgic candies while waiting for my creation.  While I've never asked, and probably should, the ice cream is very rich and probably has a high milk fat making it nice and creamy.  The back patio is a great place to relax and enjoy your treat.  They have warmers out there in the winter to keep you nice and toasty.  Just beware not to melt your ice cream.  We will continue to go here for after dinner treats.  I also love that they are open until 11pm.

Horrible.  I did not like this place at all.  It appears that they just want to showcase how hot they can get their food.  Even the regular salsa (which at most places I tolerate) like liking the gates of hell.  I'm currently pregnant and sensitive to spicy foods right now but this was was absurd.  I ordered the chicken tacos and it seemed like the meat was simply covered in black pepper and that was it.  We will not be returning.

I am shocked that this place doesn't have their own entry yet.  Time to change that because while this facility is part of Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn, it is a stand alone facility with everything you need in one locations.  I am currently 9 months pregnant with my first so this review is based on my four experiences with complications I had that lead me to the triage department and a four day stay at Labor and Delivery.    One of the best things about this facility is that it is stand alone from the hospital.  You have your own building away from the hustle and bustle of the main hospital.  You have your own entrance, your own triage center, and your own staff specific to OB which helps in having nurses and aides who understand what you are going through.    When you come in they are quick to get you checked in and taken back to the triage area.  There are about 7-8 beds in triage and a staff dedicated to that area.  3 out of 4 times I had amazing staff in the triage area of the facility.  The only poor experience is when they didn't believe the information I was relaying based on when my personal doctor told me.  This was rectified the next day by a very stern phone call from my regular OB.  They are extremely helpful in getting you comfortable, hooked up to the monitors, and assisting your through out your stay.  Three out of the four times I was in triage for a couple of hours, monitored, treated, and sent home.  The fourth time I was admitted.  Attached to the triage center is 2 operating rooms for c-sections.  Again one stop shop.  The facility has a level 2 nursery on site if needed but they encourage the baby to room in with mom.  Be for-warned, if you have a preemie baby or one with complications they may be transferred up to the Shea site which has the the level 3 NICU.  The Labor and Delivery rooms are spacious and are equipped with everything you need to labor and deliver in.  The private bathroom has a shower and a jet tub to help you relax.  I spent four nights on L&D for pre-term labor and hooked up to several IV's.  The on-call doctors and nurses were beyond wonderful and accommodating to us while we were there.  They explained all of the procedures I was facing and what meds did what and how I would react to them.  They bought me a table top fan to help with the overheating side effects from the meds.  I felt like I was demanding at times but they said I was a pretty easy patient.  Dr. Moon was my on call doctor over the weekend and she was thorough, engaging, and extremely helpful.  I did not have a single nurse ratchet during my stay.  Some were not necessarily as talkative as others but all had very good bedside manner and were polite.  The rooms are private and spacious although I do know that the post labor rooms are a little smaller.  It is very quiet and I hardly ever saw or heard any other patients unless I was in triage.  The hospital food is okay...it's hospital food, but they are okay with you bringing in outside food.    While It stinks that I've already had so many experiences there already, it puts my mind at ease knowing that I will be well cared for when I go in to active labor.   Highly recommended.
