I love this Sapporo! It has a great vibe and good energy. I have been here for multiple birthdays with the teppanyaki and the chefs are always talented, fun and make us laugh. I've also sat at the bar and had wonderful experiences! My food is always delicious, the drinks are delicious! (Especially the sangrias) and the service is always excellent and friendly! I always recommend this place for birthdays and any chance I get!

This Starbucks is right next to my work so I go here multiple times a week. This is my favorite Starbucks! The baristas are always very nice and definitely start my morning off well (since they're usually the first people I talk to in the morning). My drinks are always yummie and occasionally I'll order food which never lets me down! Usually I will use mobile order and pick up my drink on my way into work. My drink is always waiting for me when I arrive, making this a quick easy stop before work just like I want! You rock Starbucks!

Monday night I went here with my best friend. It was our first time there, we ordered sangrias and they were so yummie :) I ordered the sweet potato fries and a build your own 3oz burg. Everything was so delicious! One of the best burger joints I've been to in old town! I liked that the burgers were kind of smaller so i had room for dessert and didn't over stuff myself. The sides are really big though! The bartender was the only server there, but the service was still good! I def will be back! Ooh and the cookie with ice cream for dessert is so good too!

I went to Sakebomber for the first time a few days ago with some friends! Every roll we ordered was delicious! I even ordered the specialty roll, which ended up being my favorite! (their sauces are yummy too!) The lady at the front was super sweet and our server was upbeat and chill, so was the vibe. I definitely will be back!

I came to the pool here on Wednesday with my friend and enjoyed myself! For lunch we shared the soft pretzels and buffalo boneless tenders, I was impressed both of these were beyond delicious! I love the vibe and music at the pool. They have drinking water out at the pool for everyone which I think was a perfect idea (since it's so hot in AZ) The bartender was really nice! The only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because of how pricey their drinks are, the drinks at the pool are $15. I still plan to come here many more times in the future! And next time I'm there I plan to try out roku sushi!

I went here Wednesday night for the first time with a few of my girlfriends and we sat on the patio. Connor took care of us and he was great, he was attentive and had good recommendations for us to try and put up with our craziness. Everything we ate here was very delicious! We even tried their desserts which were so yummie too! I ordered sangrias and they were tasty and strong. I definitely would come back here and recommend it to my friends! Also, the patio is good for dogs

2 Sunday's ago (may 11) i came in with one of my friends in the evening. At first we sat at the patio bar and I ordered a sangria. I can't remember the bartenders name but he was super awesome and makes a very delicious sangria! I bartend too and I switched up my recipe a little bit just because of him! My friend and I moved to a table and ordered the pretzel app which was delicious as well! Our server was Sam and she was awesome! She had good recommendations and gave great service! I like the patio here too. I definitely will be back thanks to the awesome employees and good vibe!

I've been to Grabbagreen a few times and I have only ordered their drinks, which I thought were nothing special but were overpriced. Yesterday, I ordered a salad from there togo because I was in the area and I was very disappointed. My salad was bland and just not very tasty. The girl who took my order was nice, but the other employees were not very friendly. I work nearby and I don't think I will ever be going back to Grabbagreen after not having a positive experience here.

I stopped at this Starbucks for the first time this morning before my appt I had in the same complex. I ordered my drink on the mobile app prior to arriving, like I always do for Starbucks. I arrived and my drink was not ready... My arrival time was longer than the suggested time my drink should be ready. Usually I would not mind but remember I am on my way to my appointment and this was intended to be a quick stop. I waited for my drink for at least 5 mins until I asked the barista if they had a mobile order for me, then which my drink had been sitting behind the counter already made, ready togo and waiting. Now I am not happy my drink has been ready but not put where I could pick it up and now I am late for my appointment which resulted me having to wait an extra 45 minutes to get in, no I'm not happy at all. The staff was not rude or kind towards me, they did not apologize for not having my drink in the pickup area either. I go to Starbucks almost everyday and this is the first time it has become an inconvenience especially with my mobile order. it's safe to say I definitely will not be going to this location again.!

I came to this blancos for the first time on Thursday for lunch with my aunt. We shared the crispy shrimp tacos and chips and salsa. I definitely was not disappointed in the tacos, they were amazing! Blancos never lets me down with their delicious menu!! Also, if you park in the paid parking lot.. Bring your token in and give it to the hostess to get free parking!

I dined at modern grove for the first time tonight and I had a great experience! We ordered the Mac and cheese bites for an appetizer which were delicious! I ordered the apple chicken sandwich which was very yummy and they had sweet potato fries which I was excited about! They also carry a yummie red sangria I enjoyed with my dinner! I liked the vibe of this place and I definitely would come back!

I love oh so and I went here for brunch on Memorial Day and tried their brunch menu for the first time and it was delicious! I ordered the avocado toast and I loved it. Their brunch comes with a free select drink, I got a mimosa which was yummie! I also had a couple bloody Mary's here which were very, very good. I was sitting on the patio with my friends, my friend brought his dog (ohso is very dog friendly) we had a great time, the vibe here is great and I always recommend this place to people!

I love this discount tire! All the employees are nice and caring and are not pushy. Car maintenance is always a pain but this discount tire makes it not as bad! Brandon and Justin helped me today and they both were super awesome! I plan to continue coming here for all my tire maintenance because of Brandon! Def recommend this place to everyone!

Kaleidoscope Juice is my new favorite place in old town! They have a wide variety of healthy drinks, that I feel actually work! I am in love with the pitaya bowl from here and I order it all the time! Every time I go in, the ladies are always so helpful and sweet! The vibe here is so awesome and I tell my friends all the time about kaleidoscope!

Flower child is my favorite place to eat at! Everything on their menu is healthy and incredibly delicious! I've brought many friends to this place for their first time and they always love it! The special teas and drinks they have here are yummie and I'm slightly obsessed with their desserts! The customer service at this Flower child is awesome too! They are very dog friendly on the patio too. Oh, I almost forgot about the decor... which I am extremely obsessed with. I love everything about this place!

I've been looking for a new nail place in old town and I really like nu nails! I've been there twice and I've had good experiences! My nails always look fabulous when I leave there. The staff is friendly and I've never had to wait too long. I've brought a friend with me last time and she loved her nails and color too! I plan to continue getting my nails done here!
