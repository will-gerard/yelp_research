Every time I've been here, there is a problem. Today, I dropped my car off for an oil change and wash and asked them to call me when it was done. Two hours later (one hour at most was promised) I figured it should be done so I went to pick it up. I got there and payed with no event. It was when I drove down the street that I noticed the car hadn't even been washed! I returned and they said I needed to sign off on a waiver due to a loose piece of plastic under my bumper--no biggie but how was I supposed to know?!  In general, they don't embue trust to me and don't really seem to know what they're doing.   The manager explained that I needed to sign the waiver PRIOR to them washing my car. So here I sit waiting while they wash my car, yet still haven't signed said waiver?????  Told you, lots of excuses and false promises. I don't even trust they completed the services they signed off on.

Fast, efficient and honest service. A bit pricey, but the shop nearby would have taken three hours minimum and cost more.

Great sushi!  All of the food was amazing in taste and freshness. I will definitely be back!    I really don't get why, even if you dine in, all of the food is served in styrofoam to-go dishes. Very wasteful and tacky for dine-in eating. I would have rate them 5 stars if this wasn't the case.

This place is the bomb!  Family-owned, friendly....and best of all--DELICIOUS!  They will make you just about anything you could find on the menu at Stabucks and even some unique creations, crepes mainly.
