Best place! Owners are friendly they know my husband order by heart! They also have the best Thai Tea with Boba along with many other drinks lunch prices are cheap. Location is always clean and your in and out fresh donuts at all times, Oh try their croissant & ham so yummy ;) 5$ will fill you up believe me!

Love DSFC. This location sucks cats ass. Parking is whack and you'll probably be struck by a meth addict with no insurance. Try other locations.

Our instructor Allen was amazing. He's funny and has plenty of patiences. Came here for the groupon discount but the 5$ rope up grade is totally worth it! So much fun! Def will be coming back.

The staff needs to be more CHEERFUL Maybe they should have a scoop of JOY for them. If the FREE carriage rides are in front of their store they should be extra nice, maybe they will splurge some more! The store wasn't the cleanest. Very rude unhappy employees. Just go to the Frozen Yogurt joint. Save yourself the trip to this place.

Never again! I specifically ask for street tacos. I got 4 HUGE tacos with no flavor and loaded with water down guac! The Horchata was (is) HORRIBLE taste like, soured milk. First and LAST time. What a waste of $13.00 BTW I give it NO star I accidentally pressed the start and I can't take it back :(

This place is amaze-balls!!! Seriously all those years at The YMCA and I could of been coming to this mini resort! Love LOVE it! Sadly I think they only have this location but seriously worth the drive for those non-members that don't live near by, 2$ for a day pass... That's a deal!!!

Holy Smokes! They have a full kitchen here! I didn't notice that until now, the cashier said they just got it in like, 3 weeks ago. Spiffy.. Fresh food 24/7 even better! Keeps getting better!

DO-NOT come here. WORST place ever. RUN-RUN fast! I been waiting ONE year to get my furniture fixed. I made my payments on time yet getting service done FORGET ABOUT IT! not happening they transfer you and transfer you and well it's a never ending cycle. The wait, well that's about 1hr or more....IF they say someone will contact you. Please don't hold your breath. DID I MENTION they will take money out of your account even though I did NOT authorize it. Yeah, funny how I been waiting a year to get my crap fix but nothing, sure enough they are QUICK to take your money, they will review their recording to see if 'I' "authorize it" well, I think I would know if I said YES go ahead I'm going to pay you even though my crap has NOT been fixed! when it's been reviewed I will get my money back in 5 days. Sure as heck didn't take themFIVE days to take it! Their 'managers' are worthless.... I really regreat coming here! These people sure as heck have no Idea who they messed with, I will have my husband job with a camera at their corporate office for a consumer affair story! They would LOVE this story!
