When I first moved here, I found Sun Devil Auto and took my car in for a few routine services- oil change, tire rotation, tune up, etc. I had no issues, except the wait to get an oil change was outrageous! I got there first thing on a Saturday morning and it still took over 2 hours. You can get appointments but not for Saturdays, and I wasn't able to take off work during the week.  Later on I got a different car (a Mercedes) and had a problem with the rear brakes. I wasn't sure a shop like this would work on German cars, but they assured me they take all cars, and my particular location even had a mechanic whose specialty was German cars. After taking the car in to have them replaced, the brakes seemed fine to me (mechanically)- but the shop I changed to seemed almost alarmed at how rusty/dirty the whole wheel/break area was. (When this other shop did my front brakes they were careful to wire brush everything and it made a huge difference!)   The real kicker (that eventually lost my business) was when my car started having engine problems. It wouldn't start well when cold. I gathered up as many observations as I could and took the car in on a Saturday morning. It took them 6 hours to call me with even an estimate- told me I needed a tune-up, the spark plugs were in awful condition. Being an easy fix and pretty obvious to diagnose, I couldn't argue with that and had the work done. The next day, the car still didn't run any better. I dropped it off again, and the same thing- hours later, I got a call that they knew what the problem was, and this time it would be a little more expensive! (I don't even remember what part it was this time, some sort of oxygen sensor I believe..) Again, I paid, and again, the problem was not solved. They had me bring the car in one more time, and this time told me I needed a part that cost over $1000. I wasn't about to drop this kind of money on my $2500 car, so I eventually ended up taking the car somewhere else. (Actual repair cost around $200).   If you are going for the bare minimum maintenance services, this place is fine. But if you need a mechanic to diagnose your problems the first time, I wouldn't go looking here.

This is "my place"- if you come to town, we eat here. If you want to grab a drink, we'll go here! We even spent one horribly drunken New Year's Eve partying it up with the Rock Bottom crew. This would normally be a 5-star review but I feel like their service has gone downhill a bit in the last 6 months and this could stand to be addressed.  First of all, you cannot beat Happy Hour! As a beer snob, I often feel left out when the Happy Hour specials only include America's favorite urine-colored watered down drinks. Occasionally I can get a Sam Adam's or Blue Moon, but it's nothing to match. The specials here vary by the day but you'll be able to get a pint of beer or a mixed drink for around $3- sign up for their free Mug Club and you'll get 20oz mugs every time too! There's a patio with smoking on one side only- it's great to sit out there most of the year but does get packed close to the weekends.   The food specials at Happy Hour beat the oh-so-cheap yet mediocre Applebee's standard. Most appetizers are $3- a few items, such as sliders, show up just for happy hour and aren't even on the regular menu. There is a burger they offer for $5, and you can get a bucket of fries or kettle chips for $1.50. The sliders are my favorite (both chicken and beef), and i'd also recommend kettle chips, the spinach artichoke dip, or the nachos.   The beers could almost use their own review- there are 6 or 7 to try and account for what people like to drink. There is usually a special seasonal beer along with a cask-conditioned option. As I mentioned before, the best way to drink beer is with a Mug Club card. You'll get a 20oz mug for the 16oz price and accumulate points towards things such as logo pint glasses. If you like the urine-variety of mass-produced beers, try a Dreamcatcher. If you enjoy good flavor, try the El Jefe Hefeweizen, Desert Trail Pale Ale, or Raptor Red. At this location in particular I think the El Jefe is the best.   The food is delicious- i'm getting to the point where i've tried almost everything on the menu. The standouts are the Mac N' Chicken, the Lemon Chicken, the Smoked Salmon Fish and Chips, and the Prime Rib (they run specials on this at various times of the year). A lot of entrees come with the wonderful White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes, and the vegetables you are served are pretty flavorful. Definitely good enough to deserve coming here even if you don't drink beer.  My only complaints lately are that the service has gone downhill. We've been several times in the past few months- 3 times for happy hour and once for dinner. One time at happy hour was perfect, the second our food came out and had clearly been sitting around (coagulated cheese skin on top of the artichoke dip), and the third the food had only sat a tiny bit but it took us forever to get the attention of our waitress. The time we went for dinner the food was good, but it took a long time and didn't come out all at once. If the restaurant can resolve this, it'll earn its 5th star.

I'm disappointed that people actually go here with all of the other choices around. If you're accustomed to the spicier flavors found in the southwest, the food at this restaurant will taste bland.   The chips and salsa are nothing special- it's very much like buying a bag of yellow corn tortilla chips and name-brand salsa and putting it in a bowl. I've had the enchiladas here (the sauce is very tomato-y) and a couple of different combination platters with tacos, chile relleno, tostada etc. Overall, everything was very bland and uninteresting. I don't eat rice and beans unless they're particularly tasty, needless to say I took one bite of each and left them alone. I've also had an appetizer sampler with quesadillas, nachos, and taquitos- it was tasty while drinking but for the price, it's a better deal to put such a snack together at home.   The redeeming factor of this restaurant is its patio. It's set up in such a way that very little sun gets in, and there are misters all over. The breeze blows just right so it's always nice and cool outside, even in the middle of the summer.   This might be a good option to come for some drinks and hang out on the patio, but don't expect to be impressed with good Mexican food- you are looking in the wrong place!

This is the fastest Wendy's ever! I've never had bad service and my orders are always perfect. -1 star because it almost scares me how fast the food comes out.  But if you're going to be eating fast food... there are far worse things to worry about. Speaking of which, Wendy's has a few good items for when i'm looking to grab "healthier" fast food. Their salads are loaded and tasty, I also like the non-breaded chicken tenders. But occasionally I just come through for a speedy Frosty late at night.. always meets expectations.

Ahh.this is a great comfort food pick-up place. Every time it's cold and dreary or i'm sick and craving the foods my mother used to make, I know I can be in and out and back home in 15 minutes if I come here.   I'm a chicken lover- this is one of my favorite places. I get secretly happy when I order the 3pc dark and they give me 2 thighs and a leg, instead of vice versa. As far as other meats go, I think the turkey is bland, but the meatloaf is tasty. The pot pie is good if you're extra hungry- it's huge!  There are a wide variety of side dishes- recently they added side salads to the mix, and they've had fruit cups for awhile. You can get all sorts of hot sides, from the standard mashed potatoes and vegetables to creamed spinach, cinnamon apples, and creamy mac and cheese. You get a cornbread with each meal that you can either cover in butter or wad up into a ball and throw at somebody.    The wait times are small, even during peak dinner time when the line goes to the door. Service is always friendly, and they are quite generous with the portions. On two occasions i've had to wait an extra amount of time for my meal- without asking, I was offered a drink twice along with a dessert once. This is a good option for fast but satisfying food.

If you have to feel like you're looking cool when you eat your sushi, this must be your place. I say that because it's always crowded and I fail to see the allure.  If you want sushi, there are better places nearby. If you want to go out and party, there are better places nearby. If you want to go out and party while eating sushi, you come here!   The sushi menu is incredibly gimmicky. Be prepared to hunt for their "dictionary" so you can see what you're ordering. The happy hour deals are decent- I like both the Viva Las Vegas and Tootsy Maki rolls, but they just barely resemble sushi. Aside from the sushi, my fiance always orders the Chicken Katsu and enjoys it (particularly the wasabi mashed potatoes), but that's the only thing he orders at any Japanese restaurant.   There's always loud music blaring and after about 5, drunk girls in the bathroom. I can tolerate this place when someone else wants to go, but see no reason to eat here on my own accord.

I've been eating here once a week for about two years- it's a lunchtime staple. It gets very busy at lunch, so I always call ahead. I live nearby so I can usually get away with calling, immediately leaving, and arriving at Rubio's just in time for my food to come out.   I like the bowls the best, and I love the liberal amount of guacamole that comes in them! I also eat the salads, and if it's Tuesday, i'm eating fish tacos ($1.25). I'm not sure I'll ever get sick of the food here. I like their black beans, especially if I dip tortilla chips into them. I tried the gourmet tacos recently and they were tasty, but I crave my usual orders!   The only problem I ever have is calling in my order sometimes. Once I was hung up on (although pretty sure it was accidental...CRASH...*click*...*ambient restaurant bustling noise*....*silence*). A few other times i've had to hold for enough time I felt like it would've been quicker to go over and stand in line. I assume they don't get enough regular phone-in orders to have anyone dedicated to it, and the guy at the cash register just can't constantly be on the phone and help customers in line. The prices have also gone up a little over the last couple of years, but the food quality has remained high so I won't argue. Look forward to eating there again next week!

You will not be disappointed! Huge sandwiches for very reasonable prices. I feel like the Bobbie was created for me- turkey, stuffing, cranberries, and mayo. It's definitely a nap waiting to happen, but so delicious! The mayo adds that extra little touch.  Cheesesteaks are also fantastic, chicken or steak. It's the real deal, so be prepared to wait a little longer for one of these.  If you order anything other than a small, be prepared to have a second meal later.   This place hides in a strip mall near the Brazilian Bull and Dunkin Donuts. Saving the 5th star because a place like this really needs to either stay open late or deliver for those sudden turkey cravings!

I used to think Whole Foods was the most expensive place I would shop at- until I found AJ's! A whimsical foodie could easily go broke here. I watch their ads and generally only buy things on sale or occasional indulgences (read: weekly sugar cookie trip). Surprisingly here, some things are no more expensive than other grocery stores (gallons of water, certain condiments, Peanut M&Ms, off the top of my head), but a lot of specialty items and most of the produce are nooooot cheap. Just the act of shopping here makes me giddy- there's nice lighting and soooo much beautiful food all around.   My absolute favorite thing here is the bakery- it's top notch. Depending on how early in the day you go, there may or may not be a lot of things to choose from. I love the sugar cookie and also the red velvet cupcake. You can't go wrong with the cheesecakes, and the tartufo we found during the holidays was the richest food i've ever eaten (chocolate mousse and white chocolate mousse layered with chocolate cake, covered in chocolate). Their coffee drinks are also pretty good although I have to ask for a bit less sugar.   The prepared food bars are also delicious- they serve a dinner every night that promises a good meal but at a cost of $12-16 a plate. The salad bar is good for lunch. I haven't yet tried the sandwich/pizza bar, but it smells good when i'm there. The sushi bar also has happy hour specials in the afternoons.   Going on around the store, there is an extensive meat and seafood counter. The butchers are knowledgeable about what they sell and are happy to cut/wrap things differently for you. Recently there was a sale on Kobe beef and I came in at least 3 times that week! Everything always looks and smells very fresh.  Ok, I feel like i've covered the highlights. Beyond this, if you're after something very specific/hard to find, this store will be the one to have it if anyone does. It's fun to come buy a new gourmet salsa/sauce/coffee, snacks, or just look around. Many of the things are expensive, so make sure it's something really special!

You will not find a better costume shop in the Phoenix area. Easley's stocks most of the things you can find online, with the added benefit of being able to browse and try them on! It's very obvious the staff loves being there and loves the products they sell.   The costumes here are a step above what you'd find at a Spirit or Party City. Expect to spend more but have a costume you can wear more than once, and it's much less likely you'll run into anyone else with the exact same costume. They literally have rooms and rooms of costumes. If you're looking for something specific, it's best to ask as you could spend a long time looking for it otherwise.  If you want accessories, Easley's is well stocked. A lot of popular accessories come in several versions from a few dollars on up. They make it very easy to buy a complete costume or assemble one of your own.   Beware that there's not a lot of breathing space in here and it gets very crowded and claustrophobic around the holidays. If you want a popular costume, go well in advance- I had to ask for several Halloween costumes before I found one that came in a size besides XS.

This was my first Renaissance faire and we had a great time! I was amazed at just how big it was and how much work must go into this event each year. It's easy to spend an entire day here and not get bored- there are a wide variety of real buildings and tents to browse through, and an assortment of shows throughout the day. The atmosphere is great- you can be silly and merry and not get weird stares from the people around you. . Everyone is very easy-going and there are many children and dogs running around adding to the excitement.   The admission price is a bit steep ($20), but there is a LOT to take in once you are inside. We were feeling a bit silly and went in costume for Pirate weekend- it was a fun time even though we weren't always sure how to act! (I'm just going to maintain my firm belief that pirates have very small vocabularies.)   The drive out is long, but the area is well-prepared for the event. We came across plenty of signage and cones to direct us where to go without getting lost once. The parking situation is also nicely organized and we had no trouble getting in or out.   Once you are inside, you're transported into an entirely different world. You can go in costume or not, and either way, you won't be the only one. Just be prepared to own up to what you wear! My fiance had a parrot hanging out of his shirt pocket- after buying it, we couldn't figure out how to attach it to his shoulder.. so in a last minute pinch we cut off the tail and put it in his pocket. Ironically, it bent forward to drink or eat whatever he was munching on at the time. We were asked about him more than once. :)   Surprisingly, the drinks are quite affordable here! We were delighted to see Smithwick's on tap for a meager price of $5. The food, also amazing! If you've always dreamed of gnawing on a giant turkey leg, this is the place to do it..only $6 for more meat than anyone should reasonably eat! Men walk around with pretzels hanging from large sticks, and you can even get fresh roasted corn on the cob.   We caught a few shows- I caught our knight falling off his horse on purpose and shame him for that! 'Twas a good joust though. We also saw a belly-dancing troupe while nom-ing on said turkey leg- they were fantastic and it was great to see beautiful women of all sizes putting on such a great show! We watched the beginning of the Tortuga Twins, but the humor was just a little too much *groan* for me.   Take some money, because somewhere in between all of the beer and shops you will want to buy something silly. My man bought me a welded metal rose that even smells like real roses! How sweet. :) There were lots of shops to buy belly-dancing or medieval clothing. I saw some I really liked but didn't want the hassle of getting out of my costume. We also stopped by a chocolate booth later in the day- unfortunately it was getting warm so we had to eat it all on the drive home.   I look forward to going back again next year. It's a long way from where I live, but well worth it for a day of fun festivities!

It only took one trip to this small, family-owned shop to realize we'd be customers for life. My 1987 Mercedes was sick and the "other guys" wanted to charge me over $1k for a part that "would probably solve the problem." I wanted a second opinion from a German specialist and found this place after reading scanned-in handwritten testimonials on their website. This is my only car, but I was in luck since they had loaners! 24 hours and a $200 engine coil later, the Benz was happy again.  When you go in or call you'll most likely speak to Vivan- she's in charge. She can talk car problems with you, but isn't afraid to say when she needs to get more information from her sons- she'll even let you talk to them directly if it's not busy. She has several loaner cars to borrow (all older Mercedes) if you agree to her rules (have insurance, no smoking, fill it up with gas before returning). Nothing fancy or good looking, but a godsend when you need to get to work and don't live in the Tempe/Scottsdale area.  Mike and Ron are the mechanics- I let my fiance talk all the "car business" with them and he loves every second of it. These guys are serious Mercedes enthusiasts and love to talk tech. We've been in for several wear n' tear replacements, and you can always see your old parts. One time they brought them out to us without even asking just to show how insanely worn the front end was!   Every time you take your car in they'll inspect it, but won't push any extra services. When we pick the car up, Vivian prepares a written estimate for any issues they found- complete with analysis of how urgent the issue is: get fixed ASAP/safety issue, not mandatory, cheap to do the next time you get the ______ worked on, just do it yourself, etc. Since then we've gotten some of the work done and are leaving other work for when we have a pile of money- when we did get work done based on a prior estimate, the amount was always within a few dollars.   No matter what age or shape your car is in, Vivan and her sons will take great care of it. They're affordable, honest, up front, and great to do business with. On top of that, you get to support a local, family-owned business.

I was not amazed. Nope. Sometimes it's fun to act like a kid again. I love Dave and Buster's, but we were in the mood for go karts and it was too hot outside for Fiddlestix. I saw a deal online and should've realized then it was too good to be true.  We got 3 hours, some video game credits, and a meal for about $20 each. When I was reading the description online, I was picturing this: large pizza and salad buffet (ok, I wasn't really expecting a lot from this), indoor go karts, bowling, 18-hole mini golf course, rock climbing wall, indoor roller coaster.. I was sorely disappointed.  As soon as we walked in the door, I noticed everything seemed cheap. A lot of the paint here is sloppy, and in areas the floor is messed up. The furnishings are well worn. It looked like there used to be a large grocery/big box store here that was repurposed.  I'd already paid for our tickets online, so we proceeded.  First, we ate the buffet. There were grubby grubby children all over- I have no problem with kids (or I wouldn't have come here in the first place) but there was no supervision whatsoever at the buffet, and some children don't know enough manners to be by themselves. I stayed away from a few of the items for this reason- not enough tongs and too many dirty hands touching noses and foodses!  The "salad bar" was pathetic. Plain iceberg lettuce and not much to go with it. The pizza wasn't much either, very bland but I can see kids liking it. The pasta was the same, along with being overcooked. For dessert I had an ice cream cone and a rice krispie treat...those are hard to get wrong. We each got a beer- it took about 10 minutes just to flag someone at the liquor counter down. Eager to go be "amazed", we quickly drank the beers in a faux garden and then made our way onward.   We went to the other side of the building to start our "fun". To let our food digest, we decided to go for the mini golf first. Probably 75% of the holes are just simple variations on straight lines and zigzags. The landscaping is pathetic..I think maybe it was supposed to be beach-themed? I felt like I could build something better in my backyard. Again, it was totally unsupervised so kids were running from hole to hole, going in the wrong order, and getting in the way.   Next, we tried the "indoor roller coaster". If you've ever been to a fair, it's a Himalaya. It's a very old, rickety, bumpy Himalaya. I had bruises on my legs after riding this. I was somewhat worried it would fall apart while we were on it.  By now, we were getting a little low on time and decided to go over to the go karts. There was a long, long line that seemed to move so slowly. They only had 4 karts, and only ran 2 at a time while the next 2 people sat waiting. We soon saw why- this go kart track is just a small oval. We decided to make the best of it, and anxiously waited our turns. At long last, we were racing! Well, that was until they decided my fiance was driving too fast and *electronically slowed his car*. That pretty much took all of the fun out of it.   After that, we used the credits on our cards- the games were not a great value so they were all gone within about 10 minutes. I didn't even win enough tickets to get good junk candy, so I ended up giving my card to a coworker for his kids.   Initially, we had thought about bowling after our time expired (you have to pay extra). However, by the time we'd been through the whole experience, we wanted to get out of this dump and back home. Amazing Jake's may be good for kids who don't know any better, but it's not a good place to try and have fun if you're just adults who wish they were kids.

I used to come here for my monthly pedicures, but ultimately I just didn't like sitting inside a Walmart, with shoppers constantly going by and noises drifting in- it should be relaxing! I don't avoid this place on purpose, but there are too many better choices in the area.   Depending on the time of day, you may get in right away, or you might need to wait- but it's not like there's nothing to do nearby! It is very bright and clean inside. There are a few nail stations and 4 or 5 pedicure chairs. They have a TV on the wall that you can watch while you're getting your nails done.   Everyone here is very welcoming and nice. I'm not too sure of the situation, but the business is run by and employs several family members. The techs love to chat you up but a few are very hard to understand. That, and I don't really have enough to talk about and usually just want to relax, so I make some small talk then break out a magazine.   The service here is very inexpensive and standard. The best deal is a mani+pedi with hot stone massage that they always have on special. It's under $30, but you will be charged for anything non-basic and asked if you'd like each service as you go. The technicians are always very clean and meticulous with their work. If you get the callus removal, your feet will be baby soft afterward! No cuticles will go untrimmed. They do nice french tips but you may want to ask for a clear base polish- I think the one they use by default is too pink. You can also get nail art - they do a good job at flowers, but I haven't ever seen them do anything else.

I like two kinds of breakfast burritos, depending on which mood i'm in: 1) A burrito loaded with spicy meat, peppers, cheese, potatoes, eggs, everything! Usually doubles as lunch. Usually hurts afterwards. 2) A super breakfast-y eggy, cheesy burrito with a decent yet not overwhelming amount of meat, and a more stomach-friendly amount of spice.  Burrito Company is the latter, and they do that type of burrito well! I like  to order the egg, bacon, and cheese, then add in as much salsa as I'm feeling like. The salsa here is thin but full of flavor, and also cilantro. It will clear your sinuses but not burn your mouth. The chorizo is also yummy, but the orange grease isn't all that appealing.   Aside from breakfast, the food is good but not authentic. Think Filibertos but not as greasy and no russian-roulette food poisoning games. The Super Nachos are loaded with cheese, salsa, guac, and sour cream and will be appreciated by nacho lovers everywhere. The box it comes in weighs over a pound. The quesadillas are made on the giant tortillas folded over and over. Tasty and almost sure to induce a Mexifood-nap.   Burrito Company is worth a visit for a breakfast burrito, and is one of the most well-known spots in the area- it is one of the oldest businesses in the strip mall in which it resides. Stop by, support a local business, and enjoy the food!

Are you a victim of the Fro-yo scam? Have you or your loved ones been harmed by this wallet-devouring, cup-size-deceiving, topping-encouraging conspiracy? Help has arrived!  Surely you've stopped by one of those places. Probably at the mall. They're so colorful and bright inside and have some insane number of flavors to choose from. You pick up your cup, try out a few different flavors, then walk by the topping bar..oooh, the topping bar. You make your way to the cash register, and pay up your.. $8.72?! For a cup of yogurt? Yep, they got you.   Golden Spoon proves you can get great fat-free frozen yogurt without having to pay a lot. They have about a dozen flavors at any given time and rotate every month. Within that selection are the classic chocolate and vanilla, a few fruity flavors, and rotating specialties, such as peanut butter cup, espresso, and mint.   You can try anything, and I encourage you to do so! I make it a habit to try one flavor every time I go in even if I think i'll probably just get one of my usuals. This is how I found blueberry pomegranate- turned out to be my all time favorite! I think the texture of the yogurt here is superior to other places i've been- it's ultra smooth and creamy. I barely believe it's fat free! Some of the flavors (like cake batter) are incredibly sweet, so I've come to prefer the tarts. Usually in the same machine as a tart will be a sweet flavor, and you can swirl them together!   You can add on toppings (the employees get your yogurt and add the toppings for you) for an extra fee. They are quite liberal with the amounts when you do pay for them. I've also found them to be quite flexible with letting me getting two different flavors in a container.   They have specials on different days of the week- once you establish which flavors you love, Monday is the best! You can get a whole quart for just $4. That's about what one small cup of yogurt would cost at the mall!

This was a wonderful establishment- one day I went by and there was a sign on the door saying the ice machine had broken and a part was on the way. A few days later, the store was empty. Sad to see it go.

I love eating here- although i'd eventually like to try the entire menu, my mouth waters so badly at a few items I can't do without! You order at the counter then get a number, and your food is brought out to you in real dishes.   My favorites:  Luau Pork- decent portion of meat served over rice (I suggest the rumbi coconut/red bean rice) with some creamy macaroni salad. I don't care for the sauce it comes with by default, but instead I ask for the Orange Chicken Sauce.   Kahuna burger- a perfectly cooked explosion of delicious! It has two thin beef patties, swiss cheese, and pineapple. The combination of things, along with some mayo and a sweet squishy bun, is incredibly addictive. It comes with some sauce but i've never used it..better yet, it comes with:  RUMBI FRIES: A tasty mix of regular fries and seasoned sweet potato fries. One time they even let me have all sweet potato fries, now THAT made me a happy customer. :) They come with a sauce that i'm pretty sure is just ketchup and mayo mixed together. I hardly ever eat fries but can't get enough of these.  Key Lime Pie: It's very limey, you get a large slice. Perhaps not top notch, but better than what you can easily find in the area.  I've never tried the entree salads, but once asked for a side caesar that was fairly large and did not disappoint. I've also had the brown rice but prefer the mix of the rumbi rice.   If you check your junk mail, they send out coupons quite often. Rumbi is fantastic for a quick casual meal or take out!

I love to eat here because it's as much or as little Mexican as I want it to be. I always get the grilled chicken meals. The chicken is seasoned deliciously and usually not dry- and if you like dark meat, the leg and thigh are juicy and delicious. For sides- if I'm feeling adventurous, I get the BBQ black beans and rice. If I'm wanting comfort food, I get the side salad and macaroni and cheese. No matter what, I tend to down the chicken in their green salsa- it's the best! You can eat the chicken on its own, or pull it off the bones and put it in the supplied tortillas with salsa and pico.   While sitting in the drive through, I noticed you can see them pull your chicken off the grill, check the temperature then cut it up. That alone deserves a star, food safety at its best.   -1 star because of this location's flaw- they always seem to get one thing wrong with my order. I should probably start checking more closely but usually if I'm picking up dinner to-go I'm in a hurry. It's not usually anything major- among my experiences (from most to least frequent): No salad dressing, no silverware, no salsa, missing chicken drumstick, missing side, extra quesadilla. I guess I came out ahead once!   All in all, this is a good, fast, hearty option for lunch or dinner. You can get away with a pretty healthy meal if you pay attention, and won't be disappointed with the taste and quality.

We had an electrical scare last night and couldn't get ahold of the electrician that had been referred to us, so my husband checked Yelp and i'm so glad we found Bryan! He answered us right away and was able to come out later the same day. He was super friendly and professional and had our problem fixed in no time! It definitely puts our minds at ease knowing that we now have a go-to for any future electrical needs!

No-nonsense caffeine, fast.   The service here was very good and efficient. The menu caters mostly to sugary concoctions, but if you don't see what you want, you can ask and should be accommodated if they have the ingredients. (I wanted a caramel macchatio but only saw an item on the menu with both caramel and chocolate...no problem!)  I ordered a large for $4.50- very much in line with other places. The drink itself was less sweet than Starbucks (I prefer a less sugary drink, so this is good). The amount of espresso was impressive, I should be good to go for a few hours yet! The wait for my drink was a minute or two less than I expected.   One item I haven't ever seen anywhere else- flavor-infused Red Bull! I haven't tried this yet, but I definitely will next time. I realize this is a chain, but it's refreshing to have more options around for coffee on the go. :) I hope to see more of these pop up around the Valley.

I'd been meaning to check out Bluewater Grill (probably for dinner) since it was still the Fish Market- I finally found myself here today with friends for Happy Hour. After this visit, i'll definitely be back again to try dinner!  Happy Hour runs from 12-5pm on the weekends, which is great for meeting up with people. There are enough choices on the menu that you can expect to fill up on food, all at Happy Hour prices.  I had our waiter ramble off the list of beers (a good amount which I hadn't heard of, intriguing!) but as soon as I hear the word "Hefeweizen", I know what i'm getting. I cannot remember whose it is, but it was tasty. Beer and well drinks are $4 at happy hour- I really wish they'd add some of their cocktails to the specials, they sound so good!  There were 5 of us, so I was able to try quite an assortment of food. (Note: Not everything we ate shows up on their menus online, I noticed the same is true with the beer.) The highlight of the appetizers were fried shitaake mushrooms stuffed with spicy tuna (same as in the rolls). They were wonderful- our server suggested coming back and asking for "Jared's version", which substitutes a crab mixture.   From the happy hour sushi menu, I ordered a soft-shell crab roll and a fried salmon skin roll for a total of about $15. After taking a few bites, I decided this was well worth the price, probably even normal prices. The crab was perfectly done (crispy legs but not burnt!) and the salmon skin roll, although it took awhile, was delicious. If you're a fan of California rolls, the one here is excellent and the crab tastes very fresh!  We also nibbled on crab artichoke dip, garlic fries, garlic cheese bread, and fish tacos. Overall, there was nothing we didn't like. At $4-5 per app, 2 (maybe 3 if you're going for a full meal) per person should suffice.   The service was good but nothing special (probably a little less than i'd expect if I were there paying dinner prices). It was the middle of the afternoon and not busy, but our server always seemed in a hurry to get somewhere else. He came by frequently, but I only had enough time to ask him for one thing (water, chopsticks, wasabi, etc.) before he was off around the corner. I suspect all his tables were getting served quickly at least! As we were wrapping up, we mentioned how wonderful the stuffed mushrooms were, and that's when he told us about the "special" version in full detail. This restaurant seems to have a lot of favorites and specials and history, despite its recent changes. Can't wait to go back, whether it's for happy hour or a meal!

I found out about this place via a coupon in the mail. I can't think of any other Greek restaurants in the area, so I was happy to see this one come along.   All of the prices on the menu here are very reasonable. I've only gone for lunch but the meals are only around $5 each! And you get a lot of food for the money.  I've been trying to eat healthier, so I ordered the marinated chicken breast with potatoes and vegetables. The meal was very flavorful and satisfying! The chicken was perfectly seasoned and grilled. The potatoes (although probably not so healthy, they seemed fairly buttery) were addictive. The vegetables were still vegetables, but had the same buttery flavor as the potatoes.   My fiance is a fan of the gyro patty melt. The weight of it scares me a little. It's a whole lot of gyro meat on toast with cheese and slaw. The gyro meat here is super tender. The sandwich is almost enough for two meals.   The service here is quite quick, so it's a good option for take-out. I hope this restaurant does well because we don't have anything else like it around!

Well, it looks like word really got around about the Hillside Spot! The first few times I was here, I couldn't tell if they were open or not until I opened the door. The last few times I was here, I could barely get a seat.   That being said, it's so wonderful to have another locally-owned establishment in the neighborhood. Over the past few months, they've added a nice patio, though hopefully they'll find some umbrellas or it won't be any good in a few weeks! In addition to the restaurant, there's a small market area of candy/gourmet foods/cookware and some books/toys. The kitchen is wide open and it's interesting to watch the hustle and bustle while waiting in line.  I've only been here for breakfast and coffee so far. If it's busy, i've decided my plan is to pick up a coffee and a Cheddar Bacon scone.. wow, my mouth waters just thinking about these. They are just the right ratio of cheddar and bacon while still being buttery and crumbly.   The two egg breakfast is good but not outstanding. I felt like some potatoes or fruit would really add to the meal. On my most recent visit I had the Croque Monsieur, a combination of ham, gruyere, and bechamel over toast, with an egg on top. My meal came with a tiny serving of strawberries and blueberries. The quantity was just right and the taste delicious, although I think the bread was a little over-toasted. (I had trouble cutting into it with the knife provided.)   I plan on coming back for lunch or maybe dinner soon, and hopefully it won't be as busy. I'm happy to see they are doing well given how the economy has changed, but I don't enjoy fighting crowds for a meal. Fortunately, the delicious food and use of local ingredients well outweighs that issue.

Nice spot to stop in for a pedicure, located right next door to Target. I've never needed to make an appointment, but generally only go for pedicures and a simple manicure- I see a lot of people there for artificial nails so it may be best to call ahead. It can be busy on weekends, but there are plenty of stations so you can at least relax with a magazine while waiting your turn. This salon is a step above a lot of small strip mall locations (based on cleanliness, atmosphere, and service quality), but not as upscale as a spa. Prices are in line with the former. :)   I really like that the pedicure stations are in the back half of the salon- it's much more quiet and a bit less bright. As soon as you come in, you'll be seated and given a bottle of water. If it's busy, you get to sit in the massage chairs/spa footbath for a little bit until someone is available. As with most nail salons, there are tons and tons and tons of magazines to read, assuming you don't have a smartphone yet!  You're given a menu with different packages to choose between- I like being able to see all the prices and add-ons up front. You do get a discount if you get a manicure with a pedicure! I'm not sure if it's listed but french tips are $5 and nail art is an additional $5.   I've had many different techs here and have always had good experiences. If you get the callus removal they tend to be extremely thorough, I love having soft feet afterwards! The nail art here is my favorite, as the designs are usually more unique and complex than a lot of the other places i've visited. I get manicures about half the times I go, but thinking about it i'll probably start doing this more often. I've noticed it takes several more days for my nails to start chipping when I get my nails done here as opposed to other salons in this price range.

I grew up in the midwest just down the highway from the original Jimmy John's- I ate it as a kid, I ate it as an adult, I ate day-old bread from there for sustenance in college.. this was one of those things I accepted losing when I moved out west. But now it's here!  You come here, you get an inexpensive yet large and tasty sub. There are 3 basic categories- the Slims (~$3), with just meat and cheese, the 8" subs ($4.25), and the Giant Clubs ($5.25) - which in many cases are larger versions of the 8" subs but sometimes add extra ingredients. If you're feeling brave (and hungry) there's the Gargantuan, which is exactly what it sounds like.  By default, sandwiches are served on crusty but chewy French bread- it's what I crave most about the place and nobody else really matches  it- it's chewy on the outside but squishy on the inside and flattens around your sandwich quite well. You can also opt for the 7-grain on a Giant Club sandwich.  My hands-down favorite? The Beach Club- turkey, cheese, guac, cucumber, sprouts, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I hope they start delivering across the i-10, because this place truly shines when they deliver- their motto is "Subs so fast you freak", and I haven't been let down in the past.   You will like this place if a) you're in college or b) you appreciate a fast and cheap yet high-quality sandwich.

I must confess- this was the first time i've ever gotten my hair done at someplace that didn't have "Clips" or "Cuts" or "Cutters" in the name. My hair was getting way too long and ragged and I wanted to do something different, but not drastic.   One day, I got it. Bangs! Not the kind I had as a kid, but the wispy messy side-part kind. I usually only got a straight trim, so ability was never an issue in the past- anyone with a pair of scissors could cut my hair for all I cared. But something like this- I know you can screw that up!   I decided I deserved a treat and would go somewhere nice- I was starting to look into other places but while browsing the weekly ads, I saw Ulta had a deal for $20 for a first-time haircut. This was too good of a deal and a good chance to try somewhere new, so I called and booked right away.   Later that week, I went in and was met by my hairstylist, Martha. She introduced herself and sat me down and we went over my hair. I had brought in a picture of what I was after and she discussed layer lengths with me, then cut a small section of my hair.   Next, I got a nice but brief shampoo, and then back to the chair. Martha was very meticulous with getting my hair even and my layers perfect- I have thick wavy hair so they have to be chunky so they don't get all poofy and feathered. We got to the bangs, and she knew exactly how to cut them perfectly- I'm in love! She finished drying my hair and did some basic styling, and I was good to go.   A great first experience. I feel like I now have a "hair place" to go to, and look forward to coming back soon! The prices are on the low end of salons in the area, and for the quality seems to be well worth it.
