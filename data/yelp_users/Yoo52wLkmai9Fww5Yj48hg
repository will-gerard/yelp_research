DO NOT GO HERE! After two months of going back and forth with their billing manager, I HAVE NEVER BEEN TREATED so awful! THEY WILL CHARGE you $$ for things not disclosed or discussed.  I saw the Dr for a good 4 minutes and now I am getting screwed.   FOLLOW MY ADVICE GO TO  Valley Women for Women OBGYN or any others...   this place is not professional and you will end up with hefty bills that are not disclosed.

WOW! wow! WOW!  is all I can say after my visit today, called in and  emma the front office was super helpful in finding the place. They got me in right away! Dr Wyman is AMAZING, WARM and just felt like I was visiting a relative, the technology at this office is impressive, kim was so helpful with her opinions and super friendly,  Jenine helped me look at lenses and made it super easy no stress. Literally everyone in this office have customer service down, not only that but I wouldn't mind doing my eye exam and everything over again just to hang out a bit! That is unheard of especially during lunch hour !! I would absolutely recommend this office to everyone of my friends & family.

I had to review after seeing a bad review.  The gentleman that owns the salon is a bit of a stickler with rules and appointments BUT and this is the most important part.  Ann IS PHENOMENAL! I never have a lift, issue with quality or am ever dissatisfied when I come here.  I LOVE my nails!  I wouldn't give this place up for ANYTHING! Stop wasting your money at other places with bad results or shaped the way you do not want.  They AIM to please here... just follow the rules ;-)

WOW. I have never had to call so many times to make a new patient appointment in my life, asked if the dobson office opened later. Nope, opens at 7:00 AM, I was transferred 4 times as the other offices do not schedule for them, tried to get in to ahwautukee and between rude service on the phone and unhelpful employees who make it impossible to try to get in.  I will be taking my business elsewhere.

Yummy!  I just love this place, its been dubbed my " first date spot" comfortable, relaxed and great atmosphere especially for the east valley. I am a fan!

ABSOLUTELY NOT. How can a place go from $39 to $79 in the matter of months?! Same equipment, nothing more added or special. WHAT A RIP OFF. NO WAY!  I will find somewhere else. I recommend looking else where.  ** It would have been nice to know the price was going to increase so drastically.  I do not use the tanning beds just mystic, so for it to be so much is crazy.

LORI is the eyebrow queen! I have strayed for convenience ( I live in the far east valley)  and boy was I SORRY I did!

I love love love my eyebrows.  I cannot recommend her enough, for a great shape and wax lori is your girl!.
