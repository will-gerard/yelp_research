One star for the free Wi-Fi.  Worst airport that I have to travel too:  1.  Takes for ever to get you bag.  Took over one hour AND we had no idea what carousel our flights bags were coming out on.  1, than 3, than back to one.   2. Going through security is a complete joke, especially if you are flying out of B.  One long line, 1 lane open, and their answer to solve the problem?  Letting us know we could go through C.  Took one hour to get through security. 3.  Terminal B is to crowded (especially, Gates 10-14).  All flights arrive around the same time, and depart around the same time.  Creates so much confusion, that adds stress to the experience.  Did I say they have free Wi-Fi?

OK,  ordered it for delivery.  Will update my experience after we eat the pie.  So far, when I called and talked to the owner...1.  She is from Chicago (Bonus Star) 2.  She said that she would make our pie "special".  Chitown folks stick together.  Too be continued...

Like this place, but I don't love it...yet. 3 and a half stars  I am lucky as I get to go on some business trips and stay at some nice resorts.  Based on my stay, it usually ends up that I give my feedback to my wife, and we usually come back with the kids for a nice little vacation.    The Great.  Wonderful resort. The staff is great, and accommodating.  The concierge service is excellent.  I recommend getting a bike and taking a nice ride around Scottsdale.  Well worth it. The pools are wonderful, especially the adult pool with a very close bar.  Live entertainment in the bar area is a nice added touch. Free Wi-Fi too.  The Meh.   For some reason, when you have a king room, why do you put someone in an handicap accessible room?  Wouldn't that be brought up at check in?  Also, I was on the 3rd floor, and the lady that checked me in, just said to take the elevator to the 3rd floor.  Well, what she neglected to say, was when your room is in the 3600 rooms, you cannot access it, from the elevator closes to the check in area.  I am wondering the halls trying to find my room, and thankfully a house keeper saw me walking around aimlessly, and said that I should take the elevator up to 4, and walk a bit, and go down to 3.     Thursday morning, due to my flight being cancelled, I stayed another night.  At 11:00am, I had a knock on the door, and it was the house keeper supervisor (I think) asked if I was staying another night, I said yes.  At 4:30pm, my room still was not cleaned.  I left my room and it looked like they were done with cleaning rooms and I ran into an employee that had a cart filled with towels and told him when they planned on cleaning my room?  He looked at me and said, "Your room is not clean?" Nope.  gave him my room number and walked away.  Also, check room 3618.  The alarm clock does not work.  We will be back and look forward to bringing the family.  As long as it's not room 3618.
