The Keg is a fairly large chain restaurant but I've only been to the one located in Chandler. It looks like they have locations throughout the US and Canada.  I've been here a couple of times now and have found that the steaks are much better than the prime rib. The last time I went, I had the 20 oz rib eye. It was pretty awesome and cooked perfectly medium-rare. The prime ribs are decent....but pales in comparison to House of Prime Rib in SF.  I recommend getting the baked potato as a side dish and ask for the triple cheese butter. In fact, ask for extra triple cheese butter. It's that good.

Took me about 45 mins from the start of waiting in line until I was sitting in the rental car. I'm not sure why they have so many check-in stations when there are only like 3 people working there (with one of them being on the phone the entire time).  The line was about 20 people deep. *NONE* of the other car rental places at Sky Harbor had as many people waiting. Why are they soooooo slow?!  Next time I'm going to go with Enterprise...last time I was in and out in about 10-15 mins. No line.

I typically don't care for crab claws, but being at a restaurant where their specialty is stone crab claws, I had to order it. This is the first time I have had stone crab claw but its definitely different in meat texture and flavor than other crab claws. They crack the shell up pretty good and you just have to peel away the shell and eat. The waitress said to just eat it like you would a hard boiled egg.  Apparently, the fishermen catch these crabs, cut off one of the claws, and then throw them back. The claws grow back and then they later get caught again.  I do recommend starting off the with some stone crab claws.  For my entree, I had the petite filet mignon and jumbo Alaskan king crab legs. These were both very good...can't really go wrong with these.  The creamed spinach was just okay....the pan roasted sweet corn was delicious.

Skip this place.  Unless you get one of the limited couches in the "stadium" area, you'll be stuck with a tiny tv monitor in your booth area.  Food is mediocre. Drinks are okay. Staff is friendly.  They had a $25 per person minimum, but that is not a big deal since its easy to hit that with a few drinks and some food.  Next time I'll just stay in the local sports book area of the hotel I'm staying at.

I usually stay at the Courtyard Marriott whenever I travel to Chandler. I think the hotel is fairly new and service is always friendly.  It's weird that they have the slightly lower end Fairfield Inn & Suites Marriott right next door (the buildings connect). I think the staff is shared across both hotels....although, it should really just be the same hotel.  They offer free internet (WiFi or LAN cable)....they have a full bar in the lobby (but it closes at 10 pm). They offer a free breakfast but you have to walk over to the connecting Fairfield Inn & Suites to get it.  I've stayed at both the Courtyard Marriott and the Fairfield Inn & Suites at this location. The Courtyard was about $10 more expensive per night....and the room had a couch in it where the Fairfield Inn & Suites did not.
