I really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because I want to like it so badly! The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong!  Now, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville.

For being a 24 hour Mexican restaurant, this place is as good as it gets. There's nothing like a 3 am burrito or huevos rancheros after a long bike ride down mill. The night time crowd will probably consist of late night weirdos (I myself could be included) and the obnoxious children let out of yucca tap room. It also helps that it's basically across the street from where I often reside.I usually get a burrito with random veggie ingredients or a breakfast burrito and a horchata. There's HUGE portions, cheap prices, and their salsa is tasty too. I believe it's usually cooked to order and they are happy to deal with my picky, custom order. This definitely is gluttonous though so don't expect to feel sexy after eating.

I am in love with this shop. The shop itself, the artists, EVERYTHING. I almost find it funny when someone cuts them self short with some crappy, hepatitis C, half clothing store, half tattoo shop type of place (you know the kind...). Every time I've been here they have exceeded my expectations. None of the snobby, elitest if-you-don't-look-like-lizard-man-you-are-shit attitude like other places. I would fully trust these guys with any idea I had and I'd be happy to pay for their professional, high quality work. I also wish I could transplant their retro day of the dead inspired waiting area into my living room. Just...awesome!

Freakin' awesome. Best apology dinner ever!....just kidding.  We started with something called "tombo" which was seared tuna encrusted with black sesame seeds and black pepper. I am a little squeamish about eating things that have mushy/gushy/floppy textures so I was scared before trying it but it was INCREDIBLE. We engulfed that immediately and only waited briefly before getting our meals.  Not only were the meals beautifully plated but they blew both of our minds. I believe my boyfriend got the beef tenderloin with horseradish whipped potatoes, saut√©ed spinach, and bacon onion jam. The jam sounds...terrifying but apparently it was good. I ordered the Tagliatelle pasta with sausage, tomatoes, and goat cheese. Not being a big goat cheese fan unless I'm in Paris, the giant glob of cheese was a little intimidating but easily defeated. I looooove basil so it was a phenomenal recipe.  I am so impressed with this place. Expensive yes, but you get what you pay for. Not to mention the patio and seating area is gorgeous. As I read in a previous entry--its the type of environment that could be perfect for a proposal or just having drinks with friends.

Nice dudes who work there, light rail access, close to the places you need to be. I'm a frequent customer (approx 48 red bulls a day) and they haven't made fun of my breakfast purchases of sour gummy worms and sour cream and onion chips yet. Their keg and growler selection is one of the best! These guys like beer and it shows! I don't drink liquor but it seems they have all you need and more (except for the many flavors of hypnotiq, nobody should put that inside of their body).

Holy hell this place has stolen my soul many a time. Something about the irresistible $3.50 specials and four peaks hefe on draft just instantly ruins the subsequent morning. I love the patio, very cool surroundings-aside from the occasional meat-head hitting on me or the girls wearing short shorts just to show off their new super cool thigh tattoos. I've never had a problem finding a table...maybe I get there too early (good sign or bad sign?) and have always had fantastic experiences with the servers. The servers always seem very down-to-earth and amused at our antics so that's a plus. When one drunk guy made a shitfit and threw a plate at my friend's skull, the server was awesome enough to join in on yelling at him.  Note: Do not throw fire in each others mouths, the owner does not like that. Who would have known?

This place is the best barbecue I've had in Phoenix so far. For some reason I expected a cafe-style joint given that most places in Arizona are run that way but instead we were greeted with a big, fully decorated roadhouse style building with a huge patio and fancy interior. They even had a separate bar area which I plan to try out soon. I was told it was overpriced and overrated by my in-laws and it was everything but that! We both got a sampler platter which comes with three meat choices, a side, cornbread, and little unexpected fried sugar dough thingers to send you off. I'm usually expecting dried meat and sides that taste like they've been sitting out but everything was perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. I was even impressed by the corn that had a sweet smokey flavor to it. Only $26 before tax for two people as well. Service was great, energetic, and helpful as well. We took home what little scraps we had and had a midnight snack that reheated well too. I can't wait to come back with friends and family to show them a "cooler" version of claim jumpers.

I am incredibly impressed with this book store and I didn't even purchase anything yet. After bike riding around on a Saturday we stopped in to hang out and look around. The staff was awesome, giving recommendations and proving how well rounded and knowledgeable they were about the authors and selections. I hadn't been to a used and new bookstore in a long time and I forgot how much I loved the varying selections.  I was able to sit and read and look and magazines. I was always asked if I was still doing okay by employees.  The fact that I was not in a commercialized Barnes and Noble or Borders was refreshing. I noticed there was book signings, lower prices, interesting staff choices, and more obscure items. All these things separate Changing Hands as being friendly and more approachable. I really can't wait to get back and look around some more...

Well...I've previously used their pick up and/or delivery without fault-great price, reasonable product, quick service..and the flavored crusts are awesome. However, I'm typing this review at 4:30 am and pizza-less after ordering for my boyfriends stomach at 2:45 after a long night's Halloween crawl. No one will answer the phone in store and my boyfriend literally just fell asleep sitting up 6x+ dreaming of Mariana cheese breads/food but only to awake to a pizza-less and sad existence. What the hell Hungry Howie's?! I'm easy to please but this is just awful. I guess I'll wait up until your closing hours and hope you answer in the AM so I can get my money back. I even pre paid a generous tip...seriously?!?! Boo...

Yum!! We meant to go to Posidon, but seeing that Posidon was closed for no apparent reason, we headed up the street to George's instead. It looked like a crummy gyro fast food place from the outside (and inside to be honest). The menu had all the Greek must haves but nothing too crazy. After ordering a chicken pita with salad, I discovered that they didn't need to extra frills to prove how great they are. The chicken was cooked perfect, pita was soft and delicious, and the salad was exactly what I had been craving with it's balance of dressing, feta cheese, onions, and Greek olives. The boyfriend also nom-ed every last piece of his pork pita with tzatziki sauce on the side. I give George's five stars because their food blows other chain and better known Greek places out of the water- but they aren't gimmicky or over done. It's rather unfortunate that it's in a part of Mesa that might not be bringing in all the business it deserves. I'd like to relocate this place next to ASU, really.  Next time I want to try the hummus and dolmades..mm.

This review is mostly for my pharmacy experience not the retail store. So I will start by saying the gentleman cashiers watching me hobble in in crutches and a hospital bracelet at 5am were funny, pleasant, and thoughtful considering the circumstances! But hey it's a CVS so pharmacy is the main contender here. And I've had lovely experiences elsewhere where I've been treated with proper urgency and respect.  So I haven't filled at this location before but it's the closest 24 hour store. I originally tried to drive through at 11pm with a prescription from my late urgent care trip, my painful injury was worsening quickly and I NEEDED it. I hand it over and the overnight pharmacist says "ha. good luck finding this." "Why, what is it?" "Pain medication." "Well yes. what's wrong, what do I do?" "Other pharmacies probably won't have it." "Ok.......should I call around for it? What's wrong with it?" "No pharmacies open, better in the day when they're open." Ok, So thanks for nothing, I drove away in tears and I had to google to find out that the provider wrote me a prescription for a dosage that was totally discontinued. So injury was aggravated and got worse and worse and worse so long irrelevant story short I was in the ER all night getting proper care and had a different CORRECT prescription written for me. So I dropped off at same CVS and he ended up grilling me with irrelevant questions I've NEVER been asked before, which I can only chalk up to him thinking I am a drug addict or faking an identity. The exhausted, sick, newly casted, begrudgingly on crutches me was pissed and asked why he was asking questions and how it was relevant to which I got no reply. So, thank you sketchy neighborhood for making any normal person in pain look like they have an addiction problem and making this gentleman pharmacist make my night even more hellish! And sorry I have tattoos and feel terribly discriminated against as well. Never again.

I freaking love this place. My boyfriend brought me here for the first time because I was far too curious about the whole conveyor belt concept. It's definitely not fancy nor "fine" but what do you really expect when you're paying one dollar for a plate? Quality comes with a high price. The prices of the plates is what makes it fun because you can try something new without being afraid of ordering an entire roll of something you can't stomach and paying a bundle for it. Have I mentioned sake bombers are 5 dollars and a regular large Sapporo is 3.50? Not bad for going out.  All the waitresses have been fine. Some more English-friendly than others but always very attentive. 10 seconds after I grabbed some mandarin oranges off the belt our server was behind us with a spoon, ha.  I also like the fact that you can eat at your own pace and there's no pressure to order or finish in a typical time frame. The veggie tempura was pretty good and the miso soup was yummy too.  Overall, it's a lot of fun to eat here. It's nice-When you leave, the sushi chefs and servers all say good bye.

Worst walmart in Phoenix. I hate that this is the most convenient location for me. Every time I go I leave exhausted, shocked, or irritated. The bathrooms are always a riot-no supplies, gross, etc. I was using the sink while someone was essentially karate chopping and punching the paper towel dispenser. People shopping have approached me or harassed me inside and outside the store. Last time I went it looked like the zombie apocalypse had happened because the parking lot bomb had gone off with carts and trash littered everywhere. There were more carts in parking spots than cars. Also, this particular walmart only has the bare minimum of barely human cashiers open. I've waited 20+ minutes for a quick stop late at night. I think there's just so many people rolling through this store acting like barbaric rabid filthy animals that the store cannot keep up. Avoid at all costs.

Stopped in to try their honey vanilla latte which was AWESOME. Also enjoyed a blackberry lemon bundt cake which was fresh and perfectly iced. Parking was a little awkward but I am an awkward person so that's no surprise. I was excited to use my laptop and wifi with ease in one of their private back-to-the-wall laptop desks-not all coffee shops cater to my hibernation while I work on my computer. My only complaint was the interaction with some of the baristas. Without forgetting my schizophrenia meds or being overly paranoid, I felt like they were being weird and whispering about me, avoiding eye contact, forcing polite responses, and watching as I left, which made me feel uncomfortable. I left feeling like I had gone in with bird poop on my head that everyone was looking at but no one told me about (yes, I did check afterwards). BUUUTT....I suppose I should expect hipster girls to give everyone the "one-over" when visiting such a kewl coffee shop.

I might be a little biased, seeing as I live in the apartments just north of this place and I REALLY like being able to stumble back home safely.  I love this little place. The owner, Larry, has always been amazing to my boyfriend, friends, and I every time we come in. He occasionally makes us neon green "ectoplasm" shots...or what HE likes to call Mister G shots. Also, cheap pitchers of beer are great for the Sunday and Monday night football games that are shown here. Happy hour prices are wayyyy awesome. $3 jagerbombs and other cheap well drinks and beers.  The food is great! I honestly didn't expect it to be so tasty. We usually get $1.50 slices of pizza, a whole pizza to share, or the super deliciousness that is the "medium" wings. We learned that Larry used to own Tessios-another yummy local pizza joint-which explains the high quality of his pizza. This place is worth a try if you're not sure. The laid back, personal environment makes you feel like a regular even if it's your first time in. The business seems to building steadily purely based on the great service and great food. The place that was there before this was similar and barely "meh" quality and Mister G's blows it out of the water.

The Clean Spin is a pretty neato laundromat as far as laundromats go. I'm only bothered by one semi attractive college guy who's strictly being friendly and I'm writing this review on my free wifi. The rates for washes are pretty standard. $1.75 for the small guys and $4.75 for the "huge wash" that may be able to fit a good 10 or 12 infants inside. Aka, I can almost fit my 3 weeks worth of procrastinated darks and jeans. 25 cent dryers which is good in my opinion as well. Seeing as I'm here at 8pm, there are no attendants and the dry cleaning window is closed. Buuut it's open 24 hours and I'm happy to be left alone and not feel creeped out or like I'm in the ghetto wash. 4 stars, yay!

I've lived here for almost a year now. I've always eyed Solara while living a bit closer to ASU and I finally decided to move in. Of course I am always automatically attracted to modern looking exterior paint and interesting ground layouts so I definitely got suckered into that.  As far as the renting process had gone, it was pretty average. I'm not the most experienced when it comes to renting so they dealt with my naivity in the nicest way possible. I wish I could remember the representative in the office that helped me with my lease but he was great! A younger, friendly guy who had been there for a while. I had toured the complex before but previous roommates didn't pass the background check so I was pleasantly surprised that I was approved WITHOUT my parent/cosignor!  Move in was easy enough. The first half of my time here has been just fine. I like the feel of the apartments although it is true that they are a little older. I've been in a lot of "college" apartments and it's a lot less dingy and damaged than others. My one bedroom feels very open and spacious. The bathroom is not claustrophobic which is a major deal breaker for me. Also, my clothing addiction was enabled by the HUGE walk-in closet which is fantastic! A huge walk in AND a hall closet and cupboards-I still have plenty of space and more. I looove the gym and the pools. It's a huge step up from most amentities in the Tempe or college area. I've had a few cockroach problems. Nothing too scary but I'm not too grossed out by bugs. No giant sewer creatures-easily fixed with some roach motels and upkeeping trash and dishes. A far as maintenence goes I've had decent experiences. I've never lived in an apartment complex that actually COMES when I ask. I had an emergency in the middle of the night and the maintence dude came promptly and saved me a lot of heartache. So thumbs up to them.  The past 2 months or so have been the only times in which I've felt a bit uncomfortable in the place. The office staff keeps changing every time I call or come in and I haven't seen my original representative guy around any more. When ever I visit the office I feel like I'm interupting them even though I try my best to address exactly what I need in a polite manner. There was some confusion with rent and payments this month and I felt like I had kicked the guys dog by coming in to clarify what was due and in what form it should be received. How dare I ask to write down the amount as well. I don't have to talk to these people every day so it's not a deal breaker but I would like to feel like they give a shit about how approachable they are instead of feeling like I am annoying them after I've signed the lease. I guess I just have really high standards when it comes to customer service and I'm a bit hypersensitive but I still feel really put off when I feel like I haved called a very depressed and uninterested crypt keeper for some apartment help.  Lastly, I will not be renewing my lease for another year. Although I love my apartment set up itself, they offered me a renewal for OVER a hundred dollars more than I pay rent now. And thats before utilities and other fees! For that, I will take my money some where that's more accessible to my usual spots near ASU. My apartment is worth exactly what I am currently paying-which is why I chose Solara in the first place!It makes me wonder if others have been suckered into how trendy looking Solara is or if they actually have more to offer...somehow. Of course, I would recommend these apartments as long as they have a reasonable rental price. Let's hope my move-out doesn't change my rating.

Vegan paradise (excluding honey if you're one of those)! This place is the only thing my morning sickness will really crave, haha. If you think it's "frozen yogurt" then you have no idea what an acai bowl is and have no business reviewing this place anyway. You've probably paid more at one of those weigh-out-pounds-of-yogurt places, blarg.

One of the best customer service experiences in a restaurant ever! Thank goodness for good servers & bartenders to guide me through my traditionally awkward journey to a new eatery. Upon existing my car I do remember saying "ah, shit they're playing techno, do you want to go somewhere else?" Also weary because the dirty word "hipster" was used to describe the place. But ALAS! The drinks were fantastic and I'm overly pleased with the beer selection. I personally got a cucumber mint tequila "juice" and loved it! I'm looking forward to trying out the different combinations of flavors and liquors (hey there's a logical excuse to drink more!). Food was fantastic as well. I ordered the standard the Baja fish tacos. They are served up in taco stands and I could have managed to polish off one more. The flavor combinations are classic enough to please a skeptic and creative enough to satisfy the more adventurous such as myself. The date got a chimi-style carne Asada burrito and claimed it to be the best he's had in Phoenix this far. And that says a lot, trust me. His burrito and my tacos had fresh sliced avocado to top off our foodie perfection. Even the restrooms were an aesthetically pleasing experience. Prices were reasonable, and like I said, our server and other employees eased our social anxieties and earned their 25-30% tip to boot. I will quote, "If this is a hipster place then I guess I will join them."
