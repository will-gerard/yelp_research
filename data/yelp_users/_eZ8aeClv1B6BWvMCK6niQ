I ordered the burro with the green sauce.. wasnt too fond of it, it was sweet. My boys however, got the chorizo con huevo and they really liked it.. rice and beans were good.

All recommendations were right on. Marcie was the greatest! We had the Ravioli Di Zucca and Stuffed Pork Chop... Appetizer was Burrata Pears.. Delicious!!! We ended with Tiramusu. Everything was so satisfying. We sat in the Piano section and he played all of the songs we requested. Definitely will return.

Food, service and ambiance were all great!! FYI .. the servers use a phone app to take orders.  No, they are not texting while you are giving them your order, ha, ha.  I had the tamale & chile relleno combo.. beans are homemade deliciousness. Flavors were tasty. My boyfriend had the carne asada plate and he let me try the carne....it was juicy and full of flavor.  Finished off with soft, warm sopapillas. Best thing I thought stood out, was that all staff worked as a team. Every worker that came by either took our plate or offered us a beverage refill.. we never had to wait for service.  TEAMWORK! We will be back.

My boyfriend and I just moved in to the area and were hoping to find a new, great neighborhood , friendly bar. We mentioned we were new to the area and the bartender could care less. He seemed bothered and rushed, but found him and other employees chit chatting and playing around.  We were not impressed and there are really no good happy hour drink specials worth making this place our new neighbor hangout. On a positive note.. the queso fundido was pretty good and spicy. Still, unhappy about the quality of attention we received.

HORRIBLE! Unprofessional tech, yells at me because I was showing the other tech the difference in length of my nails. She was putting on tips and cut them down, charging me extra because she said the length was long. It was average everywhere else i had gone to before. I then showed the other tech one of the nails i thought were my idea of average and how much shorter it was from my other hand and then the first tech yells at me saying she's not done matching my nails. My gosh!!!! I told her not to yell at me and asked her to remove my unfinished tips. I did not want to deal with her. Her name is Jill. I also downgraded my pedi that was in progress. She told me,  "Thank You", when i said that's why i don't usually go here.. How unprofessional and Rude.
