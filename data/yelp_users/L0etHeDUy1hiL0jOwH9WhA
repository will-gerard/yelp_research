Hidden gem of the North Valley. THE PIZZA IS FANTASTIC - this is coming from a Chicago pizza snob, and yes, real Chicago Pizza is tavern, NOT deep dish. This is thin crust with a sweet sauce, unlike any I've ever had. I wish I lived closer, I'd be a regular. Great staff. TIP: Line out the door at peak times, for good reason, so plan accordingly.

I only know the breakfast side of the menu, but I love it. Kid friendly, take out too. TIP: ask for the Andouille Sausage, it's an off menu item.

A different kind of pizza, which is refreshing in the Valley. I also enjoy the bar setup, it's a good place to have a drink on a nice day. UPDATE: This is one of my favorite places in the Valley, both the Desert Ridge and Hilton Village locations. All day Happy Hour, kids eat free on Sunday, very fun and friendly staff! Tell a friend.

I took my family there on a Saturday around Noon. We tried to order a couple pizzas, to which they replied "we ran out of pizza." When I asked what do you mean by that, they replied again "we ran out of pizza."  I asked about calzones, it only confused the staff, so instead we ordered 2 sandwiches. It took over 30 minutes to get the sandwiches even though they were overstaffed and not busy. The sausage sandwich was burned beyond edibility, and the beef  sandwich was all bread, no beef. We left without finishing the garbage they served us. The people who were in line behind us still had not received their food either (45 minutes later) as we walked out. This place is full of fail.

I'm a big fan of Tuscany / Lazio pizzas, and this place comes pretty close to recreating it. If you eat dominos or barros, this place is not for you.

Limited menu, but what's on it is good for both breakfast and lunch; they do offer daily specials. Decent Happy Hour. Two patios, bar, and kid friendly.

Good food, great beer, good staff, great location. Kid friendly. Happy Hour starts at 2pm. Green chile pork is my personal favorite.

Friendly staff, nice patio (except for smokers), decent beer and great street tacos. Hip clientele of all ages, good for people watching.

Never going back. The first two visits, there were 4x as many servers vs. customers. Both times a server never came to our table, I had to flag down another table's server to help. Both times we were told "she must be on break" - service was still horrible. The third visit we waited over 20 minutes, no service again! No one even noticed my family walking out.
