Great food, but they don't answer the phone very often. If you can get through, they have amazing yellow curry and corn fritters.

YUM!  It's pretty good fast-food tacos.  The best is going on $1.50 fish taco Tuesdays.  My wife and I go almost every week.

I'm writing this while suffering from mild food poisoning: The service there was terrible today when my wife and I went to get dinner. The cashier was rude when my wife asked to order her burger without certain toppings (nothing unreasonable). I ordered a chocolate shake, which they forgot to make. When we waited for them to make it, I saw that they used a blender that had been sitting out with whatever was blended in it before. The milk they used for the shake was also sitting out for who knows how long as well. When she handed me the shake, I walked out to my car without having it and threw it in the garbage. I only had a few bites of my chicken sandwich and it was stale and drenched in too much mayo. Assuming the mayo and chicken was sitting out like the blender, it's no surprise I now feel pretty ill.   We'll never be back and tell all of our friends that also live downtown to avoid Lenny's. Disgusting and disappointing.

I love this place. It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall, but such a gem. Their tortas and tacos are always great and the people that work there are super-nice.

I love this place. The service is always great and the food is healthy and so tasty. I can't get enough of the garlic portobello flatbread pizza and the falafel platter.   They're really fast with to-go orders, but when I can, I love dining in. The atmosphere reminds me a lot of the restaurants around Seattle (where I moved from).   Such great staff. They're all friendly and laid-back. Really makes me feel comfortable.

Mountainside in Gilbert is one of the better gyms I've been to. The equipment is always clean and orderly. The staff has always been friendly and helpful. There are some things that would be nice that are missing: a pool, a hot tub, more of a variety of aerobic machines (e.g. rowing machines), etc.   It is a great gym for a good price (if you do the long-term commitment)

My first time going to Pizza People, I was pretty underwhelmed and the service sucked. I usually try to go back to places twice to make sure - and I'm glad I did. It seems like my bad experience was an anomaly.  Going back, I found it's turned into my favorite, go to, for easy take-out food. I'm a huge fan of their sides! They have great Mac and Cheese, fries and other sides. The staff has been really great and their prices are very reasonable.

I love this place! Well... it's within a 2 minute walk from my house, but it's genuinely great food and a fun atmosphere. It's a cool, local restaurant with good food that you can see the staff preparing. They have a good beer/wine selection, but their food is outstanding.   Their pork and short-ribs are awesome. The flat bread pizzas are good - especially the pesto one. Great local find!
