Love love love Postinos. It is such a great atmosphere and I'm a huge fan of the rasp chicken salad.   Will be back again and again!

We ate here Thursday night (2/21) and had a great experience. Our server (wish I could remember her name) was helpful & polite. She gave us wine samples and everything came out quickly.  The chocolate mousse cake dessert was FABULOUS! We will be back soon!

I continue to get stellar attention and care- no matter the doctor or the day. So lucky to call this my healthcare provider- Mayo really IS a step above the rest!

Hard to say much about this experience pleased me. We got there later on at night, around 10pm or so, and waited at the door for at least 5 minutes (by the please wait to be seated sign) before deciding to walk up to the bartender. She said, ''Oh, sit anywhere," and handed us menus. So we headed outside, picked a table, and then sat for about 10 minutes before anyone came up to us. When a server finally did come up, she was far from pleasant, seemed more annoyed than anything that we were there, and took our order. Food came fast, but was sub-par, and then we sat and waited again for her to even check on us. Let's just say her tip reflected it.

They seriously have THE coolest set up & ambiance- but it ends there.  Food is overpriced.  Hardly any healthy options.  Servers were overloaded so it took forever to get anything.

I'm sad that I had a terrible experience here, because we live in walking distance and it had the potential to become a regular stop for us.   BUUUUUUUT no. I had a living social voucher I think.. some type of social media discount.   The first problem they had with me, was that my voucher wasn't printed. Well on my iphone it clearly states, either print out your coupon or show the merchant your mobile voucher. If you are not going to honor mobile vouchers then maybe YOU SHOULD PUT THAT IN THE FINE PRINT.  After I made it clear they were going to honor this, they tried to tell me I couldn't use it for happy hour prices. Now I would definitely understand this too, had IT BEEN WRITTEN SOMEWHERE ON THE VOUCHER. Nope, nowhere. So our bitchy waitress goes to get her manager because clearly she doesn't have the brainpower to think of another excuse for not honoring this voucher....  So then this braindead manager comes over. He proceeds to tell me that he would be fine with using it for happy hour prices but the computer will not allow him to do so. I tell him to enter it in to show me that it won't let him & SHOCKER. It does let him.  Now why on earth would a place try so hard to make a customer unhappy. Because to say I left unhappy would be a fricken understatement of the year.   DON'T PUT OUT A SOCIAL MEDIA VOUCHER IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ASSES WHEN WE TRY TO USE IT.

Why pay more for a satisfactory job?? This place gets the job done and for a reasonable price.

Lucky to get even one star from me. After coming from a nail salon across the street and having them lie to us about how long we would have to wait, we were already annoyed so we asked right away how long the wait was. To our surprise, we got in immediately and within 5 minutes she was going at my cuticles.  All downhill from there.  She was pushing waaaaay too hard & deep on my cuticles so after toughing it out for a few fingers- I politely asked her to be a little more gentle. She responded with " your cuticles are hard and tough... I need to push hard..." Basically blaming my god awful cuticles for the abuse I deserved.   When she finally got done with the scalpel, she moved on to the cuticle cutter thing- and proceeded to draw blood on THREE different fingers!!!! At this point I'm near tears and not even wanting to finish- then she dumps a crapload of alcohol on the bloody ones... See my 'quick tip' for a visual- this was a day after my service, finger just looks nasty with dried blood everywhere.  Fast forward to check out- she tells me $30.50- random- that's a standard gel mani price????? She runs my card & I look at it- authorized for $35.50. I immediately point it out- she runs to the back to get a manager, then gives me $5 change from the till.  What an awful experience!!!!!!!

Shady Shady!!! I have to be careful no matter where I go in the auto repair business because being a lady - shocker alert- I am taken advantage of, over and over and over again. Well chalk this up as another bunch of jerks trying to play me.   So I come in on a weekday morning to get a routine oil change- while servicing my car the front desk guy comes out to me with a clipboard and says my cv joints on the front axle are in such bad shape it is only a matter of time before my car just breaks down on me and won't move because it's going to snap and break. Oh- and for only $400 they can just take care of this for me today.   This isn't my first rodeo, so I call my dad like I usually do and ask if this is first, a legit repair, and second, if the price is accurate. He says both seem ok but I should make some calls around to get second opinions and also bring it to another body shop to get the cv joints checked.  WELL aren't I glad I did this!!! The next shop I brought it to told me in fact there was nothing wrong with my cv joints but a mere bolt loose that he tightened for me on the spot, for free.   Thanks a lot for nothing you slimeballs.

This review is for Megan- the hair wizard. Having blonde hair that constantly needs maintenance, I am super picky about who I let work on it. After finding Megan, I will NEVER go to anyone else. If you are a blonde, she's your girl. You won't be disappointed!!

it's funny- i try and not make the mistake of reading reviews while im at a particular restaurant because i dont want my view to be skewed going into it.. but these reviews were pretty spot on, it is kind of a trashy place and my food was well.. just not good. i ordered the queso dip and chips, which really, i dont know how you can screw up, but the queso was gross and the chips were burnt. left a bad taste in my mouth. i will say in their defense, $1.50 beers can't be beat.

Went here this morning... Had a great time! Since it is new it wasn't super crowded yet & my little guy loved bubble time! Little pricey but with yelp check in we will save 3 bucks when we go back!

I came in on a groupon not expecting much, since lately I feel like businesses that are on groupon can't make it on their own because they are so baddddd... but I hate paying full price for nails so I gave it a shot.   I have to say I was pretty impressed. The pedi was pretty standard but my shellac mani lasted for a good 3 weeks!!! Being a nanny I'm constantly washing and sanitizing my hands so this was incredibly impressive.   Keep up the good work!

Cute place- FABULOUS apple cinnamon muffins.  Would have given it 5 stars but the prices are obnoxious!

Should have read these reviews before buying my groupon. Let this be ANOTHER lesson to future clients- or lack there of- this is a horribly ran business that should have NEVER put out a Groupon because they can't accommodate it! Don't fall victim to this RIPOFF.
