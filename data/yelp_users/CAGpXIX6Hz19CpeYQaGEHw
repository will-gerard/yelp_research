Teresa and get team do a great job creating unique arrangements. I love their style as it's very vintage yet romantic. I received flowers from one of my top makeup lines and the arrangement was absolutely breathtaking. The flowers lasted for about two weeks. Of course there were some that needed to be picked out but other than that the arrangement had strong lasting power. I've had a few other arrangements from Teresa since then and I always get tons of compliments.  Her staff is also very friendly and can design whatever your hearts desire. Highly suggest.

Worst customer experience of my life. I bought my mother a coat for Christmas. Their sizes fit very small and the coat did not fit her when we returned to the store we just wanted a larger size to fit. The stock woman in the back had to come out and help and she was the only nice and customer service oriented person there. They let us know they were out of the coat in any larger sizes. Then a salesperson came over certainly they could help us find her something else comparable in the size she needed. Instead we were informed they really made nothing else in a larger size but not in a discreet way in a way that embarrassed my mother. Shame on them number 1. Then they informed us they could not return the coat because we did not have the card present. Really?! We have an unused coat with receipt and I'm staring at the salesperson who sold it to me. I say I didn't have the card with me but could tell him the number to hand enter so that I didn't need to make another trip to return. Nope, that didn't work either. It is their policy to have the card present, again I'm staring at the salesperson who I worked with and remembered me from a week prior. I asked to call the manager. No we can not. Really wow, living up to the snottiness Burberry and ZERO customer service. I own a retail store and if I treated my clients like this I would be out of business. I will return with my card and be taking up with your corporate office and letting all my friends and family to never buy anything from you ever again.

I absolutely love this place! I would always buy sunglasses and would never really wear them. I found when I got them home they wouldn't fit right, hit my cheeks or just would be what I saw everybody else wearing. That is the big point of difference and what I loved about Framed Ewe. The owner Christy picked out an amazing pair of glasses that fit my face just perfectly. It was so comfortable and she adjusted them appropriately and now I can say that I wear them all the time. Have a couple pairs of glasses from the Thierry Lasry collection and I absolutely adore. Their styles are very modern but yet very unique and not something I'm going to see you and everybody else. I will continue shopping here and seriously think they have the best selection in town.

Love me so Jayd and Bronze Buddha Glow!  I love that they offer organic and healthy tans.  Jayd provides the best customer service and the location is very private but easy to find.  What I love is that she customizes the color for you.  Being a very fair red head this is very important.  My color ended up flawless!  Jayd is my go to "glow" gal.

I absolutely love this place. And the Strawberry Warrior Milk maybe one of the best things I've ever tasted. I also got a few coldpressed juices. I really enjoyed the electro-lite, especially in this heat. Great drinks, great food, great vibe and more importantly great company.

I had been hearing so much about Flower Child in the last few months and was dying to check it out. Being just a couple blocks down from my green beauty headquarters at the Biltmore what a convenient place this would be to grab a healthy lunch or dinner on an occasional basis. When I walked in the decor was super very fun and welcoming. The menu I thought was a bit confusing at first but figured it out. I realize that you could really customize it which I like. I love this place and now stop and pick up a lunch or dinner to go. Knowing that they use all local and fresh ingredients is super important to me as well.
