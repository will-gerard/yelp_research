The customer service that Patrick and his staff shows is awesome!  It is hard to find a dry cleaner you can trust and I really appreciate the extra step that Patrick goes through to make sure his customers are happy.  Thank you for saving my suit!

Completely rude. Will never go back.  Was asking for advice on what to do with my shoe repair. He cut me off and when I questioned how long it would take to put insoles in he was offended and told me to go somewhere else!  Gladly.

Myself and two friends were really looking forward to our experience at Palatte and unfortunately we wasted our time.  First of all, there was a 45 minute wait for brunch at 12:30 but we were ok with that.  There was live music and it was a beautiful day to sit in the courtyard and wait.  We enjoyed some lemonade and coffee while we waited.  Then as time went by we realized people who arrived after us were getting seated.  Apparantly we got skipped over by the hostess.  Nonetheless, once we pointed this out we were promplty seated.  The Fritatta of the day is one of their specials and the Meat Fritatta was on the board.  It sounded delicious and I knew from the start that is what I wanted.  When we sat down, we ordered amongst other things, the fritatta, a tuna melt and another lemonade.  Turns out they are out of Lemonade.  The server then returns to inform us they are out of Fritattas as they usually run out by noon.  I suggested that perhaps if they always run out by noon to make enough to last until 2:00 or take the special off the board if you are out.  Either way I decided to settle for a tuna melt as well.  But what do you know - they were out of tuna too!  If you go to Palatte, the atmosphere is quaint but bring your patience and a sack lunch!

Mojo is awesome and the perfect spot for battling the upcoming heat.  The yogurt is delicious and being able to pick and choose your flavors and toppings to your taste makes it even better.  The experience is easy and hassle-free.  Nice addition to Mill Avenue!

I just started taking my 9 year old shitzsu and 1 year old mixed breed puppy (high energy) to Doggie District and we love it!  The dogs have a blast on days that I have a long work day and we all come home ready to rest.  The staff has been great and keep me informed throughout the day with updates and photos.  I would highly recommend joining the pack at Doggie District!!
