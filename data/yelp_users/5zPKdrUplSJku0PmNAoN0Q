I love this bar because it is big and never overly crowded. There is plenty to do, from darts to pool to the occasional karaoke. The bartenders have always been nice and attentive (there is a bald guy that is usually there who is incredibly friendly). I've only ever tried the wings as far as their food goes and it has been hit or miss. The last time I went they were fried to a crisp but I think that may have been because the kitchen was close to closing. Other than that, I have nothing but good things to say.

I came here after hunting for HOURS for some type of bra/slip that could accommodate my backless, V-neck, sheer, see thru bridesmaid dress. I literally came the dress over my pajamas feeling (hilariously) defeated. The girls that helped me were AWESOME. Offered lots of suggestions until I found something that would work. Didn't have a chance to browse any other merchandise but based on customer service alone I will be back! Thanks ladies

I decided to try the Vig after hearing good things and conveniently having a credit from local dines ($15 for $30) and figured it was a good excuse to try it. I think I made the mistake of telling the waitress that I had the certificate from the start because it requires an 18% gratuity to be added automatically and I think this gave her the ok to give some pretty shitty service. Definitely not the place I would recommend if you are in a rush to get somewhere (which we were, unfortunately). It took almost 2 hours to receive our meal and pay for the tab, we could never find her or wave her down to ask for refills or the check and she acted uninterested to be helping us in the first place. If the tip is already included I still expect to get the same amount of service as if you have to work for it. I also don't understand companies that put out coupons or deals and then the employees practically eye roll you when you use them. Very irritating.   Now, if I block out the service issue and think just about the food then this place definitely would deserve more stars. Food was delicious, good portion and decent prices. I had the turkey sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries, both of which were very tasty although I wasn't very fond of the dipping sauce with the fries. Tasted like cumin? Not sure, wasn't my thang though.

I've really grown to love the body shop this last year. All of the products I've tried have been great quality, smell awesome, and can almost always be found with some sort of promotion. Some of my personal favorites are the seaweed toner, the banana shampoo and conditioner and satsuma body butter...YUM!   What makes the body shop even better is their customer service. I'm reviewing this for the Arrowhead location but I've also been to the PV mall location and both have been great experiences. The employees there are so helpful without being overbearing. If you have questions they try to help you and always seem to try to find you the best deals possible instead of pushing product that you don't want. I always check back to see what kind of promotions they have going on and try to stock up (this helps if you buy a lot at once and can get their love your body card for free which is what I did). I even got $10 free towards product on my birthday month and they even called me to remind me to use it! I've invested a lot of money into their products and will continue to do so!

I want to review this place as I was admittedly a difficult customer and they handled my issues graciously. I had problems initially with my groupon and with schedule/rescheduling and felt like there was a week period were I was on the phone with the front desk everyday. Luckily, they were all very nice and accommodating and the two massages I received there were outstanding. I saw Elaina the first time and Ron the second. Both are awesome therapists. I wish I could go back more frequently but they work off a membership service which I can't commit to unfortunately. That, and difficulty reaching the front desk (it always goes to voicemail) would be my only complaints. Otherwise, great experience!
