This place is not good... parking is a nightmare,  getting around to your seat is horrible.  The theater in the round is neat. But this place is ghetto. ... not a good first impression.  When picking seats, try to get seats in section A, section B has a  walkway right in front of uou that is super annoying.   Also the concession stands are so loud it's hard to hear the act.

Never go on a busy morning!  We went on a Saturday at 9:30 am and they were out of a lot of bagels, all 4 coffee dispensers were empty and it took 15 minutes to get our food to go... after ordering!  It was a cluster! They gave our food to someone else and it took 5 minutes for the lady to make an iced coffee.. from the menu, not customized.    The food was fine, but this quick service restaurant was in the weeds and super slow.

Had a great lunch here today. The servers were busy yet attentive. They had mother's day  specials (free dessert!) And a fun atmosphere.   I love their humus and chicken plate... so good! My friend tried the coconut curry special and was satisfied.    Their green tea is awesome too!

Good breakfast spot for a weekday! Wasn't crowded at 7am. Nice and quick service. I ordered the French toast- pretty tasty!   I've drove by on weekends and it's pretty crowded- indulge on a week day and enjoy your space!

This is my first time in this location and it was an awful experience.  The bathroom was not clean and not well kept. The help desk was overloaded and it took forever to ask a simple question of where a section of books was located. The starbucks cafe was a joke. I totally understand they are not a fully functional Starbucks, but that is no excuse for poor service. The gals behind the counter were slow AND rude?!   Will not return :(

Get the Chicken Chop Salad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Phew, now that I got that important information out there... I can tell you that it was a delightful lunch.  Our waitress was spot on and really fun.  We also ordered the Nacho Trio app and the cheese was sooo gooey, spicy and delicious!  And then there is the cornbread... that was too good to pass up too! And since we were having mexican, we had their $6 margaritas and well, it was a great girl's lunch!

We went to The Keg for a special occasion - a friend's anniversary!  When she made reservations she let them know it was her anniversary - when they arrived - there was a Happy Anniversary card on the table - signed by the wait staff!  It was so sweet!  Our server was on his A game for most of the service.  Very attentive for the most part - till the food came, then he kind of forgot about us.    5 of 6 people at the table ordered Prime Rib - everyone enjoyed a well cooked and succulent slab of meat!  We all got the combo that came with salad and a side.  Great meal at a great price!    The 6th person, odd man out, decided to get the 1/2 rack of ribs - he was disappointed.  The size of the 1/2 rack was more like a 1/4 rack of ribs - the bones after the meat was taken off looked like chicken wing bones... so sad.  We did get to express the concern to the manager - she was very apologetic and offered to fix the issue in several ways - bringing out another 1/2 rack or some prime rib... or even comp the meal.  Great work on her part.    My advice - stick with the steak!  Prime rib is great and so is their baseball steak - had it before!  They also usually give you a piece of cake or dessert if it is a special occasion.

Lots of money for not much quality. Yes, the ambiance was nice, but the focus of our trip, the food, was not worth it. I ordered the steak with the king crab. Kudos to the for actually making it lump crab versus shucking your own. However, it was so dry I had to ask for a replacement.  They were quick to get a new fresh order out to me. It was fine, but did have shell mixed in. :(  Another positive was that my steak was cooked to perfection.    We ordered the Chipotle mac n cheese and the peppercorn parm mashed potatoes.  Mac n cheese was flavorful and a great spin on a classic. The mashed potatoes were flavorless. Which made the dinner even worse... I was so excited to have them!   In the end we thought we'd redeem the night by getting dessert to go..  carrot cake and turtle pie. We've yet to eat them, but regretted the order as soon as we got the bill... they were 12 bucks each!!!  So in the end we spent $200+ tip on a meal that was worth maybe $100.   This place has some cool factors -ipads for wine and dessert options and great service, but I wouldn't pay that much more for those qualities.

Not my cup of tea... I've dined here many moons ago and remembered liking it.   However,  today was not the same. They have a fairly efficient oder line with great customer service. After ordering you go to an assigned table and wait for your food.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy and was not impressed. They were bland and pasty.  I ordered a side of bacon and it came with a side of grease... this can be expected,  but when yiu only have one napkin and no true server, it's a compromise to dab it off... My husband ordered the demi breakfast - it was tiny! Looked like 1 scrambled egg, a biscuit and 1! Sausage link.  :( disappointed.

If you are looking for Chicago style pizza this is the place to go!  We used the order online function and had our pizza in less than an hour.  We ordered the 20" pizza - thin crust with pepperoni and sausage - it is huge!!!! We also ordered a 16" Hawaiian pizza - pan crust.  This was not my favorite type of pizza - thin is the way to go!  We ordered the 2 dozen wings - 1/2 BBQ and 1/2 Buffalo - they weren't the best wings ever, but good.   We had 9 adults and 4 kids - and all the pizza and wings were gone!    The delivery guy let me know that there was a closer location for future reference.  I really find that to be an awesome experience... typical restaurants would tell you to call the other location... I really appreciate that they made the order and delivered a few miles out of radius!  So great!

Tonight's experience was not typical... but I feel that I need to post, just in case this is a new trend.   We order pick up from this location 2-3 times a month and the wings are amazing!  Tonight I opted for something different - the buffalo chicken ranch sandwich.  My husband went and picked up our online order.  I ordered it at 5pm for a 6pm pick up. He arrived at 5:50 and had to wait till 6:15 for the order to be ready.  The protocol for pick ups is for the folks working the window to go over your order before you leave, opening every box.  Unfortunately, my husband had no idea what I ordered, so he didn't realize my buffalo ranch sandwich was missing BOTH the buffalo sauce and the ranch!    I was so excited for him to arrive home but so sad to realize that my sandwich was a true disappointment. :(  My sandwich must have been ready on time (at 6) and sitting under a heat lamp because it was a dried out and gross.  I didn't eat it - fed it to the dogs and ate some hot dogs we had in the fridge. :(  My husband's wings were perfect he said.    I was so upset that I called to complain.  The manager apologized and offered to credit my account for a chicken sandwich for a future purchase.  I really didn't feel like that was enough to make up for having to eat hot dogs for dinner!  there was no way I was driving back to get a new sandwich, but i feel like a little more could have been done.  Again, this isn't a typical experience, but felt compelled to share.

Had an amazing experience this evening.  My battery was dead when I woke up - finally got it jumped and drove it over. They tested the charge level of the battery and let me know I could leave and maybe be OK, but not guaranteed. Went ahead and got the new battery. He installed it super quick and all was right in the world again.    I'd definitely go here again. these guys really care about their customers.

Great place for a celebratory dinner. Primarily seafood menu with giant stuff lobsters. This is my husband's favorite place to go in Phoenix.  We go for his birthday every year.  It is a bit pricey, but definitely worth it.   There is a romantic ambiance with dim lights. ASK FOR A BOOTH!  Otherwise the tables are pretty close together so it feels like you're part of their experience too.

What a fun place! We are checking out Dana Carvey tonight! They have good food and great priced drinks. Checked out the line up for the coming year and some big names are comjng. Definitely going to come back.  The burgers were great and the fries were crispy (very important to my husband).   We sat upstairs,  which I think was better than than the ground floor.   Quick service,  but auto gratuity was added to our bill, on top of a 2 drink minimum per person... only downside.

What an enchanting location! Great authentic food. We enjoyed the pizza and  a salad in the patio. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 is that we ordered the salad and then the pizza and the salad came out after we were 2/3s done with the pizza! We were also going to a show after dinner and couldn't take the salad with us. My advice us to let the staff know you're on a time line if you need food quickly, otherwise this would have been a perfect "chill" meal on the patio.

Great place for breakfast!  Our Bachelorette party went here for breakfast and really enjoyed the selection.   I tried the breakfast panini and it was amazing! Nice crisp bread, eggs and bacon with pepper goey jack cheese and creamy avocado.   The service was good and it wasn't an plain American restaurant like in other casinos - a delightful surprise!

As a gal from Georgia, I have had my fair share of Chick-fil-A - in fact, its one of my favorite places to go!  This place is the best Chick-fil-a in Gilbert - very fast and so friendly!   My usual - class #1 with BBQ sauce, my husband gets the spicy chicken sandwich.  He likes to mix the ranch and buffalo sauce to have his fancy sauce! :)   Again, this my favorite location - despite being busy, they are fast and always helpful!

Best local pharmacy!  As a person that manages multiple medications, it is such a benefit to have a neighborhood pharmacy that is accessible and helpful. I almost don't want to write this review - as I don't want them to become too busy!  :)    Liz is awesome and always helpful AND she remembers me.  I would prefer to work with a person versus doing the mail order prescriptions. If you are looking for customer service, this is the place!!!

If you love your pet, you'll send them to Pete and Mac's!   We have been taking our beagle(s) here for 3 years now.  We love the attention they get and how attentive the staff is to the pets and the owners! :)  We use them for daycare, boarding and grooming.    Daycare - the spend most of the day in a pack of dogs accompanied by a dedicated worker.  The are allowed to roam inside and out all day.    Boarding- they can share runs and are always well taken care of  Grooming - we typically get the "Had it up to Hair" which gets everything nail to toes.  We also get shedex - which also gives you a follow up de-shedding appointment a week later!    We know our dogs love going there, but most of all, we know the staff loves our dogs coming!  We get report cards and you can see that the staff is authentically excited to see our dogs again!   Again, I cannot recommend them enough!

I'm not sure what has happened with this location - the performance has gone down tremendously.  We tried to go Saturday morning, but they were not open!?? They were supposed to be open at 6:30am and it was 6:50am...So we went today and it was not worth the wait!   The biscuits must have been left over from Saturday they were so hard and the piece of chicken on the biscuit was a 1/4 of the size of the biscuit.    They must have known that the biscuits were old because they threw a gift card for a free grilled chicken sandwich.  Why not just say they were out of them and had us choose a better/fresher option?   Won't be returning.

If I could give no stars, I would.  My poor husband. The Chick-fil-A at San Tan in Gilbert typically fails in some way when he is getting food from there - wrong item, no fries, no answer at the drive thru.... but today takes the cake.   Today when he opened the steamy foil package, he found a bite taken out of his sandwich!!!!   This is enough for me to even boycott this location. :(   I called and spoke with the manager and told her that someone in the back was hungry. She apologized,but there is no excuse.

Talented technicians.  These folks really know how to do gel nails - they always last 2 weeks.  They are also up to date on nail trends! Their powder glitter is awesome- adds dimension to your color!  This place is really clean.  I am picky and have tried other places, this is the best.  :)

What a romantic evening dinning on the patio watching  sunset over Camel Back. They have an extensive  menu of steaks, hence the name.  The meals are crafted with skill, care and the highest  standards.  We enjoyed the waygu  beef and the stuffed lobster as our main courses. I might have a defined enough pallet to differentiate  between  the waygu and a filet, but it was tender and tasty and an advetourous choice. The lobster was completely  shelled and stuffed with goodness.   Our accompaniments were the parm gnocchi and broccoli  mac n cheese. The gnocchi  was not my favorite,  as the tomatoe sauce was too sweet. The Mac n cheese was awesome.     So I have to talk about the popover, it was a very charming  bread course. Definitely  try it. They even give you the recipe!   A delightful  evening. A great choice for a special  occasion.

I love coming here in the morning.  Typically, I use the drive thru. Great customer service - always very nice and polite.   The Dunkin App earns you lots of free coffee! If the Cardinals win, you get a free medium iced or hot coffee! During the summer they also do a 99cent coffee or iced coffee for a few months.

Dr. Ben Johnson is an amazing and caring practitioner.  We moved here from Alaska and were looking for a new chiropractor 2 years ago!  We've seen him for regular maintenance and for flare ups and spasms.  My husband often has back issues and Ben has been there to help me get back on his feet.    Ben also has a great staff.  Always friendly and kind.  His massage therapists are always great at helping therapeutically versus a spa massage.   Great place to get adjusted! :)

Jeff is genuine, hardworking and a lifesaver! My husband thought he could fix our pool when the motor seized.  He spent 10 hours and about $300 before he gave in and called a professional.  That's when Jeff came to our rescue. Jeff tried to salvage the motor my husband bought and tried to install, but alas it was beyond repair.   I tell you all this so that you know two things: 1. Don't try to fix it yourself (it will cist you way more)and 2. Jeff tries to save you money and repair before replacing.   Now, we have a "pool guy" to call!

Bananas Foster French Toast is the bomb!  Split the plate with a friend today - it was great to share... but I really wanted my own in the end!  ;)  The sauce on the toast was sweet without being too sugary.   i love their iced coffee!  great spot for breakfast!  They have a walk up counter for ordering, makes it pretty quick!

A technician arrived less than an hour after I called!  He quickly inspected the door and let us know that the spring was broken.  He replaced the spring in less than an hour.  He was kind, polite and courteous.  We found MasterCraft Doors here on Yelp.    We almost made the mistake of going with the first company that showed up on Google.... that company has many 1 star reviews!    Thank you Yelp!!!

Saber knows how to cook good clean food!!! I typically eat here 1-2 times a week... I always get their grass feed topless burger. Always cooked to perfection,  topped with a creamy butter,garlic tomato mix. The fries are awesome- regular or sweet potato!  The sauted veggies have this simple yet irresistible flavor!  I work at the school down the street and we often cater from Herb N Flavors - guests are always amazed by the food we serve.   This is a local business that cares about their customers and the quality of their food.

First time eating at Thirsty Lion.  Good service, good food, large portions.  The restaurant has a really fun atmosphere.  We tried the spinach and artichoke dip and the pretzels and beer cheese.  Both were good - the beer cheese was very hoppy -  but the pretzels and the spinach dip were awesome.  Had the fish and chips - pretty typical.  My friend had the fish tacos - big portions and they were tasty.    Definitely a fun place to go for a fun night or to watch football games.

What a delicious way to start a Saturday morning!  I've been told by friends that I ever catch this food truck at the Gilbert Farmers Market that I need to get a breakfast quesadilla!  It was so amazing - we had the chirizo version and it was so good.  The mixture of cheese and queso was spicy tasty!  I'd highly recommend getting some breakfast next time you are out and about!

The most fun and entertaining dinner! Thus was my 3rd time to this location and it was even better! We had a friend in from out of town and wanted to show him a good time, so we got a reservation here!  Our chef was amazing and funny and kept the sake coming! It was our friends birthday,  so he got the royal treatment!   The food was so great. We all enjoy sushi beforehand -the Rockstar roll is my favorite!    A friend said "I didn't have one bite that wasn't awesome " :)  Good times!

The staff at this Coach store are nothing short of amazing.  They are very kind and very helpful.  I look forward to going to a Coach Outlet during the holidays! Always at least 50% off of regular and clearance items!    Sometimes you find the best deals in the non-clearance items... don't under estimate the new items!    Typically the sales associates will be walking around with calculators assisting you with the discounts - word to the wise -50% and then 30% additional is not equal to 80% off...

Best fried chicken joint in town! They specialize in fried chicken. Their menu is narrow, but the are great at those items: fried chicken, fries, toast and coleslaw.   They have a loyalty program that gets you some free food, but not often. You can get a free finger if the Cardinals win!

Duke's replaced our AC unit back in April - I wanted to wait a few months to write my review.  My husband obtained 3 quotes form different HVAC companies and he felt that Duke's was the most personable and reliable company.  The owner did the quote and his team came and completed the install.  Prior to their visit our guest rooms were generally 10 degrees warmer... now they are as cool as the rest of the house!    Dukes was professional and really did a great job.  They cleaned up issued left by the last HVAC crew.   Highly recommend them... and they really do have quite the fun Dukes of Hazard theme! :)

A friend introduced me to this coffee shop!  I've been once so far and plan to go back.  We are both in grad school and need to find a place to study outside of the house!  :)  The coffee is good and the staff is nice.  The place is clean, including the bathroom.    There are cushy couches and tables for picking your spot.  They do have live music there on the weekends...   Only draw back is - if you go later in the afternoon you are there during the DJ's sound test, which can be a bit distracting.    I hope to go back to study and possibly for wine or beer in the evening. :)

Tastiest burgers on the strip! Clearly GR knows what he is doing when designing a menu, but this surpasses any other burger I've had. Great and attentive staff, quick service and all the quality.  Started with the parm fries with fresh made ketchup- so flavorful!  I had the mushroom burger.  Great taste, cooked perfectly.  Try the margaritas. .. so refreshing and delicious! ****check in at hostess stand to be added to wait list and get a text alert when your table is ready!*****

Local favorite!  These folks care about their customers and their food.  Good old fashion breakfast.  I've only had breakfast, but i'm sure the lunch and dinner is great.  They turn tables quick, so if you see a line outside, you'll probably only have to wait 15- 20 mins.   I love their champion pancakes! they have granola mixed into the batter and really hit the spot.  They have great biscuits - so get excited!    My husband loves that he can make his own omelette and he likes to order chirizo, broccoli and cheese - his way! :)

Excellent food and tough choices... I always seem to have a hard time deciding between the sandwiches, the burrito and the pancakes/french toast options!   Had the burrito for the first time today and it was huge... great flavors with the green sauce on top!  This location seems bigger than the one in Gilbert.    Come early, there is always a wait, but it's worth it!

I don't like to write 1 star reviews, but a dirty restaurant deserves 1 star.    We arrived around 4pm for a late lunch/early dinner (on Thursday) and to work on a group project and ended up staying till 7pm.  During this 3 hour period I can attest that I wasn't just there during a shift change or slow period (like other reviews suggested).    When we arrived the line was condensed to the area by the baked goods.  They only had 3 menu boards up on the wall (maybe they are in the process of being changed?) so I had to look at the menu when I got to the register, which annoyed the person taking my order.  They politely brought out my sandwich and it was fine - nothing amazing.    But when I went to put away my tray, the return bin was overflowing with gross dishes and trash - it looked like it hadn't been cleaned for hours.  And there was a surplus of employees.  The drink stations were littered with trash and spills.... and this didn't change when I went to fill up my cup with water at 7pm before leaving.  Tables were dirty too.   I know I'm not their ideal customer - staying and working on a project for 3 hours, but  I'm still a customer.  By being there for that long of a time period and to witness no change in the dirtiness, there are no excuses.    The only saving grace of Paradise Cafe is that they offer their Iced Coffee in a canteen and it has free refills - great for working on projects!  So, I might try a different location.

Best Doughnuts in town!  We always pick up Bosa for work gatherings, but I'd never been myself.  We took my visiting family in to pick up breakfast and it was a treat!  Their doughnuts are always fresh and tasty!  The selection is great!  Always the best fritters!  They also have coffee, iced coffee and boba!   My favorites: Apple Fritter - cooked a little longer - crispy! Taro with boba - right on the money! Iced Coffee - great taste and hits the spot!

Amazing evening with great company and great food! This place did not disappoint!  Our service was outstanding!  James was very entertaining and endearing.  He described the food perfectly.  Our pallets awaited this amazing food and full flavors danced in our mouths!   I could not decide what to order, so I ordered 2 skewer apps and the butter drawn lump snow crab! The scallop skewer was flam kissed to perfection with a wood taste to the sear. The flank steak was so flavorful. Both served with a spicy side salad. I had plenty of food and felt i was able to try exactly what i wanted for my first visit.... all under $80.  The other ladies had amazing dishes as well. We ended up all sharing bites throughout the meal! So amazing.

A fun coffee stop! These folks are serious about getting you coffee quickly in a fun way! Prices are great,  but they are popular in the morning,  so it might be a long line... but the typically have a runner come and get your order so it's ready when you get to the window.   Great coffee, great service, great idea!!!

What an awesome neighborhood bar! The owners are so nice and friendly! The bar has plenty to drink and the food is good too! My favorite is the spicy edamame!  They typically have a special infused liquor on tap- apple pie was to die for!!!  They have a patio area, large screen tcs, suffering board and they try to host a sip and paint session once a month.    I don't live super close, but my friends do and they are always there! Also an added benefit is that they are near the AirWorx jumping place for kids..  so you don't have to wait for your teenager outside playing on your phone... just go to Duke's!

Tge waiting room is very comfy and they even have water guns for kids to "help" wash the car as it goes through the tunnel!   The guys from the oil lube were so nice. I was very impressed with their customer service.  If you sign up for their text message speciaks, you will get coupons often.

Great hidden gem! We've lived in Gilbert for 3 years and  just found this awesome seafood place! My husband and I both enjoyed the fillet mignon. I added crab, which was amazing!  My husband really enjoyed the lobster he added. We also started with the lobster mac n cheese- it was HUGE! and delicious!    The service was incredible,  we made a reservation and were sat as soon as we arrived.   A new favorite!

This is an awesome extension of the Flagstaff sweet shop! This is an amazing company with amazing sweets! We usually make a special trip to the Sweet Shop when we visit Flag, but now we have our own in Tempe!    What's good? EVERYTHING!  The fudge is super fresh, just ask for a sample! They have some great combos too... chocolate covered chips!!! Lots of peppermint bark during the holidays.  Super tasty carmel and dipped marshmallows!   I snagged some dog treats for my pups too!!!  And last but not least Gelato! So many flavors, again, ask for samples... but pistachio is the best!!!

What a delightful and relaxing experience! I picked the #2 mani and pedi. Vicky and Lein were great! Very clean and nice chairs. Prices were good too. I'll definitely be back!

AMANING! I'd give them 10 stars if I could!  I've been waiting for the newness to die down so we didn't have to wait an hour to be seated, so now they didn't have much of a wait!!!   The staff is on point! We had a kind and funny waiter that was super helpful.  The burgers are awesome!  I got the one with a fried egg on top... I couldn't believe how awesome the flavor was.  You have to try it!   We HAD to get a shake as well, so I got the Nutella crunch and it was off the charts.   I can't wait to go back again!

High hopes, big let down. :(  We came on a slow Sunday afternoon hoping for a fun girls lunch. Unfortunately service was slow, drinks were either all ice or really watered down... heir bloody Mary's were translucent pink... sad. Food was bland. Tacos were solar to what I make at home... not worth the money. :(   Only plus was good 90s music and chips and salsa.

Its bowling style golf!!! Everyone gets 5 swings and rotates while the score is tracked by RFID tags in the ball on the screen!   What a fun place to go with friends! It was a fun and exciting  atmosphere.  I was really nervous  to go, as I am a real beginner, but I ended up doing pretty good! You don't have to bring your clubs, they provide them -for free!  Also, you rent the bay by the hour, not by the person, so after everyone has a top golf member card ($6), it's a pretty cheap evening. They also give military discounts! The food and service was great! Interesting options. We opted for the Mexican sushi wraps- mushi - and it was awesome!    We went early on a Saturday morning and there were still plenty of bays open, but lots of people crowding to get in. I cannot wait to come back at night and see it all lit up! And maybe enjoy some beers.   Kid friendly! they have kid sized clubs or a "club house" with shuffle board and video games.

My friend swears by this place - its by her house and she loves it... so I decided to go with her today. It was a great experience!!! The folks were super nice and very skilled!  They are a busy little shop - so if you're in a rush, call to make an appointment.  I'm surprised this place doesn't have other reviews!   My friend also gets her eye brows waxed here and says they are very good.   Hidden gem!

We heart LoLo's! The classic chicken and waffles are the perfect combination of sweet and savory. The waffle has a lite crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  The fried chicken is crispy and generous in size - I order the Betty Boop! My husband always gets the big ass chicken sandwich and loves it. It is huge!! Great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  If tge weather is right, opt to sit on the comfy patio.

Sad experience today, Lo-Los's is no longer our favorite.  Had bad service and not great food. My husband and I ordered the same thing (chicken sandwich) and they looked totally different.  A friend's chicen was dry. The waitress seemed like she would have rather been anywhere but there.   We wondered how a restaurant in Gilbert had immediate seating... guess now we know.

I have to recommend the grass fed burgers! They are cooked to customer temperature preference and deliver on grilled flavor. I always choose the GF sourdough bun and bacon and avacado.  This is a delicious treat! The sweet potato fries have special seasons to make them pop! This  is a great new, healthy option in Tempe!

Taste of home!!! My family's roots are from Chicago and I grew up eating Italian beef sandwiches.  Being so far away it was a rare layover at O'Hare that would get me this combination.     Portillos is an amazing eatery that has a long, but fast moving line.   I highly recommend the Italian beef and cheese with sweet peppers,  wet. This means the sandwich is dipped into au jus and it creates a succulent bite!!! Their fries are great and you can top it off with a chocolate cake shake!!!  There are options for those that live the lighter fare and Chicago hot dogs, but I'd go for the Italian Beef!!!!

Get the Pumpkin pie shake while you can!!! It's the best! Loving it tonight! Tried the beef and cheddar croissant... not my favorite.  Will stick with the classic Italian beef on hoagie.  Brought my parents (from Chicago) because the can't find Italian beef in Atlanta!

Great food with a wide selection of breakfast items. This place is ALWAYS busy! So go early or have a tiny snack before you go.  They definitely have a little spunk to their style. You'll enjoy the food and tge atmosphere.
