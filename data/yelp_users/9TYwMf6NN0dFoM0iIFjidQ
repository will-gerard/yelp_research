My car battery died at 3pm on a Sunday. They close at 4pm and I knew the tow truck would not arrive in time before they closed so I called to ask if I can have tow truck drop my car off and they work on it in the morning. The guy working offered to stay until I was there and just but the new battery in for me right then so I wouldn't have to be without a car. I was very pleasantly surprised! THANK YOU!!!!!!!

I love how late they are open. Perfect for a quick piece of pizza after a wild night on Mill. Workers are very friendly and efficient. I wish the space was bigger because it gets very crowded in there.

When I first moved in I thought this place was great! Perfect location, price isn't terrible, and people were very friendly. Upon moving out we found out there were all these "hidden fees" we were required to pay. I also heard the management was sleezy about security deposits and so I asked to be present for walk through. They laughed and me and declined my request. I also asked numerous times for my apartment to be sprayed because of cockroaches (I lived on 4th floor) and they simply said it was not their problem. I am embarrassed I gave my money to a management that is full of scumbags who are out for money. DO NOT LIVE HERE!!!!!!!

The only positive thing I have to say about this place is the location is perfect for a college student or someone involved in business who travels a lot. Other than that this place is HELL. They will take your entire deposit even if your apt is spotless upon move out. There is cockroaches everywhere and I was living on the 4th floor (cannot imagine those living on first floor). They get new employees every week so none of them know what they are doing EVER (maintenance guys are awesome though). They also do not remind you that you need to write a 60 day move out notice (even if you have a lease saying a specific date you are moving out) so you get stuck with an apt you don't want to be along with numerous fees. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE PEOPLE! You're better off living at an hourly rated motel 6.

Employees are always so friendly and deal with the chaos so well! Also, animal style fries.

My mom and brother came to visit me from Oregon and we were looking for a place to watch the Duck civil war game. I had passed this place a few times and took note of the Duck flags hanging outside. We decided to check it out. Everyone was more than welcoming and beyond friendly. You could tell that everyone at the bar were regulars and all knew each other so we were approached by a few employees introducing themselves.   Very fun bar! They even had a food truck so people could order food after the kitchen closed. The only negative I have about this place is that the TV's inside were a few seconds faster than the ones outside so if you're sitting outside you know a big play is about to happen when everyone inside screams.

My friend just moved in to the apartments next door and got a $25 gift card so we decided to check it out. I was more than pleased with the atmosphere and friendly staff. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. Wednesday and Friday are trivia nights and I will definitely be returning to enjoy!

Very cool and relaxed bar that is a lot of fun. I'm a student and stop in if I'm early to class for lunch and beer or just to do some homework. They have trivia night a couple nights a week I want to try!

Very unhappy with the remodel. You cannot smoke on the property so if you want a cigarette you have to leave the bar and re-enter which is inconvenient if you are not finished with your drink or it is a busy weekend night.

I am obsessed with with shredded beef tacos! They are so good and very well priced. I also love their beergaritas but they are pretty pricey. Also, they do not have a full bar which I find surprising with its location being on Mill Ave.

Really cool atmosphere! Would be a great place for happy hour after work. We just got takeout and all the employees were wonderful!
