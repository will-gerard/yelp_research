They must have new management at this location. I've gone there for years but today when I went in the service was terrible. I had a coupon but they said I could only use it online. No problem. But it took them several times to clarify whether or not I had to go online. Still no problem. Then I proceeded to use their app in the store to order my pizza. But their app doesn't let you order all of the pizzas that they have available in the store. I talked to the same manager and she said that I couldn't use the coupon. The main problem is that they offered no real solutions, they were rude and I walked right out. I would not suggest going there anymore, though it used to be great. There are plenty of other great pizza places with better service.

Brought my mom, wife and kids for Mother's Day. Even though it is a busy day, they accommodated us quickly. My wife loves their flavored coffees so she had Irish Mint and it didn't disappoint. My Eye Opener of eggs, bacon, and chocolate chip and banana wholewheat pancakes hit the spot. The bacon was so perfect that we were talking about it in the car the whole ride home. Love all the Good Eggs, this location might be our favorite.

I had been going to LA Fitness for a couple years. I also coach high school sports and run some of the training, so I thought I had a good grasp on fitness. The problem was that at LA Fitness I was temped to do only the things I wanted to do... basketball, elliptical machine, and a few other things that I felt good about, but honestly I had almost no results.   My friend suggested North Scottsdale Crossfit. The diversity of the exercises and how quick the workouts were really appealed to me.   Kevin, the instructor, introduced me to the correct form and encourages intensity but  nothing crazy. After you get going there is a fun environment of encouragement and competition, mainly with yourself to beat your previous marks.   For those who already know about Crossfit, you will find an authentic Crossfit experience, not a cardio-class that occasionally incorporates the Crossfit approach.    I highly recommend North Scottsdale Crossift.

Their lunch special is a great value. $4-5 for a real authentic pizza with character and home made mozzarella. Wow. Love this place!

The owner contacted me to assure me that they have maintained their high quality of food and recipes (which I certainly agree is top notch) and are working on the proper training of their staff. He asked for another chance at our business, which we will do. I appreciate him reaching out and caring about our community, we need more of this and less of the chain restaurants. I'll update when we get a chance to eat there again.

Wow! A gem and a find. These guys know what they are doing. Got a margarita pizza and it may have been the best I've ever had. The crust was a little chewy but in a flavorful way and the sauce and spices kicked in with subtle timing that speak to their expertise. Great interior and staff. I can't wait to return.
