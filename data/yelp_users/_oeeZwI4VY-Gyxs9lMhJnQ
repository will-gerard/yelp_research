The House Specialty is absolutely amazing. Don't let the spice keep you from ordering it! This spice is super favorable, with the perfect amount of hotness! It is served piping hot and along with a side of rice, beans and tortillas, which helps with the toning down of the spice.   We come here just for this dish, not that the thought hasn't crossed our minds of changing it up, we just keep coming back to the malcajete caliente! This Diablo sauce is addicting.   The service is always great, staff is friendly and love the Mexican music, really puts the authenticity to the whole experience!

This review is strictly on to-go order experience. I called in a to go order at 10:47 AM for some clients. Arrived at 11:15 and was told my order was not ready and that I can pay when I get my order. Register girls have no personality by the way. I proceeded to the already full waiting area, and this is where my 50 min wait began. 2 registers, one for in store orders and one for to-go. There were two customers paying for 10 separate orders individually, which took forever, while food was sitting there getting cold.   When my number got called at 11:50 by the not to go order register, I told the I cannot smile girl that I had called in my order almost an hour ago and had been waiting over 45 mins, she said not one word and took my card, and handed me my order.  The burritos were falling apart as clients were eating them and felt really bad. They did love the flavor! I would love to bring them more burritos, but really can't find myself going that again.  The whole order process is in dire need of some organization and friendly people!

Oscar the sushi chef is great! Positive attitude, the whole staff for that matter.  Favorite rolls are Jackpot, Ahi Ahi Roll and the Bloody Orange! Come early to get a seat at the bar, it's the best seat in the house!

Carry out is a nightmare. First of all, you have to wait in the same line as the customers eating in. And with one register open? Your pizza is just sitting under a heat lamp an you can't do a thing about it but wait till the 5-6 people in line go throughout their ordering. This has happened to me more than once and it is very irritating.

Great resort! Attended the Used Car CPO Convention, and was really impressed with the resort. The decor is lavishing throughout the hotel. When you walk into the lobby the aroma makes you want to camp out. The view from our room was magnificent! Sunset to sunrise, breath taking! The bad... We didn't win in the casino!

Phoenix Roll... So yummy! I have to say this place has great tasting rolls and it keeps me coming back for more! I've tried other places, but for some crazy reason I keep coming back! Call it addiction, or just  great tasting sushi! Service is great!

Great patio setting, Monterey crÃªpe was popping with flavor! And they had Tapatio, which is a must on eggs or anything Mexican or Tex-Mex.

We have found our favorite Chinese food place! The establishment is welcoming. Owner is engaging with customers, he makes you feel welcomed.   Our favorite dishes are Citrus Chicken ; which is perfectly crisp, and mouth watering! Spicy Fried Rice, just the right amount of spice and the combined ingredients are amazing with chicken! Kung Pao Beef; another crisp dish that is one of kind! We have visited many locations in search for the crispy beef, and this place has mastered it!

Dr. Halle is a GREAT chiropractor! My first visit, nearly a month ago was all about Dr. Halle listening to me and was very clear about not working on me on that first visit. Instead, he listened and educated me on how chiropractic works. My second visit was all about the results and what the findings were and from that day on, a partnership was created. My pain is obsolete (lower back) , and because of the process (multiple visits) I have noticed my right hand has not ached at all. I talk to everybody I know about how Chiropractic care has changed my body and life. I have recommended Dr. Halle for his professionalism and excelent work to friends and family!
