The best Mexican food that I've found in the valley, and absolutely worth the risk of getting shot while driving down Van Buren.  All the food I had here was incredibly fresh, delicious, and flavorful.  It seems that everything is made in-house, including the tortillas, and it shows.  Prices are great too - I got two tacos and a burrito for about $12.  I also love the huge charcoal grill in the middle of this place, although it does fill the restaurant with smoke on occasion.  What I ate:  Lengua taco - super tender and fantastic. Carne asada taco - extremely flavorful and just really awesome. Chile relleno burrito - a MONSTER made of delicious.  The only reason I was able to eat this and two tacos is because I'm a fatass - I'm pretty sure a normal person couldn't even finish the lone burrito.  I also tried a bite of someone else's fish taco and it was awesome.  Most places deep-fry their fish for tacos, but La Tolteca grills it, which gives a different flavor and texture that is absolutely fantastic.  The salsas are also really fresh and delicious.  Even though I prefer spicier food, the mild salsa verde was very flavorful and delicious.  The salsa habanera had a good kick to it and satisfied my craving for something hot.  La Tolteca is awesome, and it's unfortunate that I didn't find it until after I moved out of Phoenix.  I'll be sure to stop by every time I visit though, as this place is worth it.

Giant Hamburgers.  My friends thought I was joking when I asked if they wanted to meet up here one night.  Nobody could believe there was actually a place called Giant Hamburgers.  The food was pretty good.  The burgers were good, but they weren't anything terribly amazing.  The fries were awesome though, especially the chili cheese fries.  And the tiny bit of chocolate shake I tried was also excellent.  Just remember to bring cash - they don't take credit.  If all else fails, there's a Fry's right next door, so you can go over there and buy a pack of gum to get cash back.

Angel Sweet makes me sad.  Really sad.  Why?  Because I can't have milk.  I go here with friends and try just a little teeny tiny bit of what they're having and end up horribly upset that I can't have any more than that.  My body's aversion to milk is a moderately recent thing, so I've eaten ice cream and gelato for a decent amount of my life and can say that this is some of the best stuff I've ever had.  Angel Sweet rivals the gelato I had in Italy (seriously).  One nice thing for us non-dairy folks is that they have a decent selection of dairy-free stuff as well.  Almost all of their fruit flavors don't have dairy, but still manage to be fairly delicious.  Hell, it's better than any other dairy-free stuff I've had, so I can't complain.  I just wish I could eat a big bowl of their crazy-ridiculous-chocolate-death gelato.  Maybe one day.

I go here to get my hair cut because it's nearby, it's cheap, they do a good job, and everyone is friendly.  They only do walk-ins, so make sure to grab a number when you get there.  Sometimes the wait can get bad, like during Saturday afternoons, but normally I can get in and have someone cutting my hair within 15 minutes or so.  For $13 you'll get a haircut and they'll shave the back of your neck with a straight razor.  Just make sure to bring cash - they don't take credit cards.

I go to Ninja regularly and for the price, it can't be beat.  Ninja doesn't have the best sushi in the East valley (Sushi Eye in Tempe is better), but it's a great place to go for the all-you-can-eat sushi.  $20 will get you endless sushi and a bowl of miso soup, and the quality of everything is good.  The rolls are all tasty, and the nigiri is good (although, again, it's not mind-blowing).  I go there with large groups of friends and we all go with all-you-can-eat and literally sit there eating and talking for a solid 3 hours.  They keep bringing out the food and have never been upset that we stay there all night.  The one thing to be warned of is don't order anything you can't eat - you get charged extra for anything you don't finish.  However, since you can order over and over and over again, this isn't a big deal.  Just make a bunch of small orders so you can be sure your eyes aren't bigger than your stomach :)

So the first thing I noticed when I walked into Cyclo was the atmosphere.  It's very cool inside - there's a big painting across one of the walls and there's an old, retro-style light post in the middle of the room (think The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe).  The interior of Cyclo isn't very big by Phoenix standards (I suppose it's enormous by NYC standards), but it's certainly large enough that things aren't cramped at all.  There's good, mellow music playing at a not-too-quiet-or-too-loud volume.  The menu has a decent number of choices, but isn't overwhelming.  All the prices are very reasonable - an entree will be around $8-10.  We started with Spring Rolls and they were good - the shrimp inside had a really good flavor to it.  Then we moved onto our entrees.  I got Saigon Rice Vermicelli, which was a big bowl full of vermicelli and various meats.  All the meat had *fantastic* flavor.  I spiced the dish up with some of the chili sauce that was on our table and really enjoyed it.  The dish was a good size, although I can eat a house so it didn't quite fill me up.  She got Pho with beef (sorry, I can't remember exactly what it was called).  It was MONSTROUS.  Seriously, I've never seen a bowl of pho this big.  Anyway, the flavor of the pho was excellent - the broth, the meat...everything was just awesome.  Then we got our bill for dinner with one appetizer and two entrees - it only came out to $25 and change (plus tip, of course).  And the food was awesome.  This place is a keeper.

If you're looking for somewhere really fantastic to go to for a special occasion, Kai is a very good choice.  Sure, it's spendy, but if you can get past that, you'll have an awesome time and a really superb meal.  First off, you'll need to make reservations pretty well in advance.  I was lucky enough to get a table only a week out, but you should try to get a reservation at least two weeks or so in advance or else you might not get one.  If it's a good time of the year (read: not summer), make sure to request a seat outside on the patio, as it's beautiful out there.  Don't worry about getting cold if it's winter, as they have heaters outside to keep you warm.  The menu here has a wide variety of choices, and everything is really fancy and unique.  There are a few salads, a bunch of appetizers, and some really great entrees and desserts.  In addition to what you order, the wait staff brings out a bunch of different complementary things as well - fresh breads, various small things to snack on, palate cleansers, etc.  I really don't feel like I can write a review that does justice to how awesome this place is, and I'd recommend you read the Feasting in Phoenix review of Kai to get a better idea of what to expect.  It's at:  http://feastinginphoenix.com/?p=213  I had never eaten at a five-diamond restaurant before this and really didn't know what to expect, but Kai was really an awesome experience and I'm very happy I went there.  They have fantastic food (the buffalo steak entree is AMAZING), great drinks, and probably the best service you'll ever have anywhere.  The view from the patio is awesome, and if you can get a reservation around the time the sun is setting, it'll be just that much better.  Just be prepared to drop a good amount of money - if each person gets a drink, an appetizer, and an entree, you'll probably very easily spend $70-100 per person.  Very, very highly recommended.

YC's is pretty fantastic.  You go in, pay $8 or so, and you get approximately one metric assload of food (note: metric assloads are larger than American assloads).  However, a lot of this really depends on your skill in packing as much food as possible into a fairly reasonable-sized bowl.  If you're like me and enjoy few things as much as having the blood of cute animals dripping down your chin, you should probably pack the bowl to the top (yes, I'm serious) with meat.  Don't forget to grab a few sheets of parchment paper so you can crush everything down and maximize the amount of food you get in your bowl.  Anyway, your veggies, noodles, and whatever else you want can be piled on top of the bowl o' meat.  If you do this right, your leaning tower of delicious should be roughly 3 times or so the height of the bowl.  Next time I'm at YC's I'll have to take a picture so this can be better illustrated.  Oh, and don't forget the sauces - they really make or break the meal.  If you're unsure on what kind of sauce to get, there are chalkboards all over with recipes, or the friendly YC's staff will help you figure out what you might like.  I'd *highly* recommend if you follow a sauce recipe to make double because you're going to need a lot of sauce if you filled your bowl up like I told you to.  YC's is probably the best bang for your buck lunch or dinner you can get in Tempe.  Chances are good you'll end up with enough leftovers for at least another meal or two.  Just don't forget, doggie bags are 50 cents a piece, so bring some quarters or singles.

Nothing would make me happier than finding good Indian food in the Phoenix area.  Unfortunately, that hasn't happened yet.  We started off our meal with two kinds of naan - one stuffed with lamb and one stuffed with chicken.  The lamb naan was very mediocre - the meat inside was completely dry and not very flavorful.  The chicken naan didn't seem to have any chicken in it, so I'm not sure what happened there.  We ordered our entrees and were asked if we wanted rice with them.  We said yes, but when our check came out we discovered that they charged us $2 per person for rice.  Seriously, two bucks each for a little thing of rice with our entrees.  $2 could've bought each of us a 5-pound bag of rice at the grocery store.  Also, it would have been nice if they had mentioned to us that we would be charged for the rice.  But I can't stop wondering why they charged at all for rice - every Indian place I've ever been to just brings rice out with the entree.  So this pissed me off, and I would've given Royal Taj 3 stars if they hadn't charged us for rice.  The entrees themselves were alright, I'd say very average as far as Indian food goes.  They were flavorful and the spice level was about where I expected it to be, but I've definitely had better Indian food before (not anywhere in the Phoenix area though).  When we were done with our entrees, we ordered some Indian coffee.  About 10-15 minutes passed with no sign of our coffee.  Then, they brought us our check which had the Indian coffee on it.  We waited for our server to walk by so we could mention we never got the coffee, and after another 5-10 minutes, our server finally came by and brought us the coffee.  This was kind of upsetting.  Also, not that this has any effect on my rating of Royal Taj, but we had a lot of difficulty communicating with our server and the rest of the restaurant staff.  It didn't seem like anyone spoke English very well - when we asked for something, we received a confused look and then the person walked away.  This made our experience more difficult.  Overall, I'd say Royal Taj is overpriced and the food is just very average (at best).  Time to continue the never-ending search for good Indian food.

I kept walking past this place over the last couple of days and decided to look it up on Yelp.  What I found was one review that started with "I have never eaten here."  I quickly realized it was my duty to check Ginza out and give it a proper review, and so, tonight, I went there.  As its name implies, this is a Japanese and Korean restaurant, so they serve food from both cuisines.  The atmosphere is...interesting.  There are wooden masks all over the walls and two fish tanks - one that's very boring and one that has a couple of neat fish in it.  I showed up around 7:00PM and Ginza was very quiet - there were only a few other people at the restaurant.  I wasn't sure if this was a good sign or a bad one, but I decided since I was already here, I was going to stay to eat.  This was a mistake.  I ordered a sashimi plate as an appetizer and for an entree I got eel served over rice.  About 20-30 minutes later, I got my appetizer and my entree at the same time.  As soon as the sashimi was set down in front of me, I knew this wasn't going to be a good meal.  The fish was still frozen!  And I don't mean just a little frozen - it was pretty damn frozen.  I gnawed on some of the frozen fish, gave up pretty quickly, and moved onto my eel dish.  The eel itself was pretty decent, which is the reason I'm giving Ginza 2 stars instead of 1.  However, the bowl that the dish had come in had been drowned in soy sauce.  There was literally a pool of soy sauce at the bottom of the bowl that the rice was soaking up.  Ick.  This reminded me of some kind of teriyaki bowl from a fast food Japanese place, except with eel.  While I was eating, a couple walked into the restaurant and was seated near me.  The guy ordered a Sapporo for $4, and both him and I were surprised when they brought out Sapporo in a can.  I personally think they should either carry Sapporo in a bottle or mention on the beer menu that it's in a can so you know before ordering.  Meh, maybe I'm just too picky.  Anyway, I really wanted to like this place and prove Lee F. wrong, but I wasn't able to.  Don't waste your money here.

Lo-Lo's has some of the best food you can find in Phoenix, and they honestly make the best Southern food I've ever had.  Their fried chicken is absolutely fantastic - it's just so moist and flavorful.  Their Mac 'N Cheese is also excellent.  Honestly, everything here is just really good - the only thing that disappointed me was that the cheese grits weren't quite as cheesy as I had expected them to be.  Still though, they were delicious.  If you're looking for good Southern food, this is absolutely the right place to go.

My friends and I keep coming back to Bavarian Point for one main reason - the beer.  The beer selection isn't anything mind-blowing (although it's not bad either), but the fact that you can order 1-liter beers that come in enormous beer glasses larger than your head is a novelty we can't find much of anywhere else.  Oh yeah, and the food's good too, so that doesn't hurt.  We've been a few times now and always have a great time.  I personally feel the food is a little on the expensive side at around $20 an entree, but that's not too pricey.  Most of the food is very good, although I've had one or two things that I would put into the "just okay" category.  They also have lots of dinner specials every night, so if you don't see anything on the menu that appeals to you they might have a special that you'd like better.  Dinner also comes with a pretty well-stocked salad bar, so that's a plus.  Service is always excellent - we generally end up talking to our server for awhile when we're here (blame the 1-liter beers) and they're always really friendly and outgoing.  Recommended.

Definitely the best Thai place I've found in the valley.  The food is quite good, although it's not mind-blowing.  They'll make most dishes as hot as you want them, which is a big plus for me since I enjoy food that's painful.

Lalibela is significantly better than Blue Nile, which is the other Ethiopian place in town.  Portions at Lalibela are larger and the food is also much better.  I've tried all kinds of different dishes, from the various meat dishes to some of the veggie dishes and even some of the interesting beverages they have, and it has all been good.  If you're looking for a unique but good dining experience, this is definitely a good place to go to.

Los Dos has some of the best tortillas ever - they're homemade, thick, soft, and just perfect.  The food is great and very flavorful, and the couple of times I've been here everything I've had has been good.  They also have quite a few daily specials in addition to what's on the main menu, so make sure you check those out.  The chips and salsa that they serve might be too spicy for some people, but in my experience, they're more spicy than most of the dishes, so don't worry if you think they're too hot.  The margaritas at Los Dos are also excellent and they're huge.  The atmosphere is also really cool and there's usually good music playing.  Give this place a try!

Fat Heads is awesome - huge portions of tasty food at very reasonable prices.  I went here for lunch and just had water to drink, but their beer menu looked very extensive and seemed to include quite a few different things.  I had the chicken spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer and the beauty and the beasty HEADWICH.  Yep, they're called headwiches, probably because they're as big as your head.  Anyway, everything was delicious, and the beasty sauce on the sandwich was spicier than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise.  The sandwich came with their chips, which you can tell are homemade.  I thought the chips needed some salt, but once I added a bit they became fantastic.  Highly recommended - I'll be coming back here next time I'm in Pittsburgh!

Alright folks, here it is - the one bad review of Romeo's.  Maybe I went on an off night, who knows, but I was definitely far from impressed.  The menu is massive - there are probably 100+ things to choose from.  Be prepared to spend a good amount of time sorting through the menu and trying to decide what to get.  Keep in mind that the entrees are quite large - you'll have plenty of food left over.  Anyway, we started with the Greek Skins (potato skins with gyro meat, feta, and some tzatziki-like sauce).  These were the best part of our meal.  They weren't amazing, but they were definitely enjoyable.  We then each got our entrees - I opted for Paella Barcelona (all kinds of meat - various seafood, sausage, etc. in a red sauce over brown rice) and she got a chicken dish that had a whole bunch of veggies with it (sorry folks, I don't remember what it was called).  My dish was okay but really could've been a lot better - the red sauce wasn't nearly as flavorful as it could/should have been.  Her dish was uhhh...in a word, bland.  There was a minimal amount of flavor to everything.  The veggies just tasted like steamed veggies and the chicken was almost completely flavorless.  The sauce that the veggies and chicken were in didn't help anything - nothing had much flavor at all.  Then I remembered each of our entrees was $20 and that made me even less happy.  We decided to take a chance on dessert and were pleasantly surprised with that.  They have a *massive* dessert selection - there are probably 20-30 different things to choose from.  There are cakes, bars, tarts, truffles, you name it.  Dessert is cool because you can walk up to the front area and take a look at everything in the display cases to see what looks good.  We had a hard time deciding, but went with the chocolate-covered cookie dough, chocolate-covered macaroon, and the double truffle bar (a dark chocolate and orange bar with Grand Marnier).  The bar was alright, although I thought the crust was really dry and didn't have much flavor (the display said it had a hazelnut crust but I didn't taste a hint of hazelnut).  The chocolate-covered macaroon was better, although macaroons aren't really my thing so it wasn't that amazing for me.  She loved it though.  Then there was the chocolate-covered cookie dough...oh man.  Sooooo good.  And cheap too - the chocolate-covered cookie dough was only $2 or so.  Anyway, the mediocre quality and moderately high price of the entrees are the reason Romeo's gets two stars.  I'm still planning on going back though for dessert sometimes - they have some really awesome-looking cakes that I just have to try :)

Solid Thai food in North Phoenix.  The portions were a little on the small side, but we got $6 lunch specials that came with an egg roll and fried wontons, so it's likely that the dinner orders are a bit more generous.  I had a chicken red curry ordered Thai hot and was happy that they were actually willing to make it hot for me.  Too many Thai places won't actually make their food hot, although I've found that the magic words "I promise I won't send it back" go a long way when ordering.  When the server brought out my dish he said that they made it "diarrhea hot," which took me by surprise as diarrhea is a word that a server should never, ever say.  I was unfazed though, and ended up eating a delicious curry that had a good amount of spice to it.  The restaurant itself is large, open, and comfortable, and the food is good.

I started off my visit to Quaker Steak with the Atomic Wing Challenge, which is just eating six of their atomic wings.  Six wings obviously isn't much, but the atomic wings are quite spicy and they require that you sign a liability waiver before eating them (this is more for show than anything).  Yes, they're pretty damn hot, but they're bearable as long as you have a good tolerance for spicy food.  If you're comfortable eating foods with habaneros in them, then you'll have no problem with the atomic wings.  Here's a pro-tip though: if you're getting the atomic wings, ask them for a pair of food-handling gloves.  This way you can avoid getting wing sauce all over your hands, allowing you to actually touch your eyes or use the restroom later that day without torturing yourself.  Anyway, after I finished that off, I went back and got some more wings - Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic.  I was impressed with the flavors, as everything was quite good.  The wings were nice and meaty too, which is good because a lot of wing places manage to hunt down wings with almost no meat on them, which kind of defeats the purpose of eating them in the first place.  My one complaint is that I think the wings are a bit overpriced.  A half dozen wings is $5, and 83 cents per wing seems rather high to me.  Still though, these wings are much better than most, so it's probably worth it.

Lollicup is pretty awesome, and I can't decide if I like them or Boba Tea House better.  Lollicup's boba is a bit more chewy, while Boba Tea House's is a bit softer.  I like the softer boba, but Boba Tea House's boba is almost completely flavorless while Lollicup's has this very subtle sweet flavor that's just awesome.  If you like new and interesting things, I'd highly recommend the Ginger Milk Tea.  It's very gingery and a bit spicy, but it's probably unlike anything you've ever had and is just really different in a good way.  Don't forget to get a punch card so you can get free drinks if you go here often :)

Simply awesome.  The drinks are good and the boba is fantastic.  Boba Tea House has a huge variety of flavors available - everything from the simple (mango, peach, thai tea, etc.) to the more exotic (taro, lychee, jackfruit, red bean, and others).  Be warned that some of the more exotic flavors are pretty weird by American standards, and if you don't know what you're getting yourself into, you might not be happy with your drink.  That said, everything I've had here has been good, and it's always made quickly without much wait at all.  They do have punch-cards if you go here often, and you'll get a free drink for every 9 drinks you purchase.  Screw going to Starbucks for a crapuccino - I'll stick with boba tea.

Sprouts is probably the best place in the East valley to get most of your groceries.  Their produce is fresh and the prices are excellent.  Seriously, buying stuff at Sprouts is cheaper than buying at CostCo, and you don't need to buy 500 pounds of everything you want.  For example, today I got 5 pounds of yellow onions for $1 and 10 pounds of russet potatoes for $0.99.  Their spice section is excellent too as you can buy bulk spices - if you need a tablespoon of an obscure spice for a recipe, you can just buy a tablespoon for 25 cents instead of buying a $10 jar that will mostly just go to waste.  Sprouts also has very fresh meat and seafood.  They have a decent selection of fish - I get ahi tuna steaks here and they're quite good.  Sprouts also has a huge section of various kinds of fresh sausages which are giant and fantastic.  Since Sprouts is a Farmer's Market/Organic type place, there will be some things that you can't find here and will need to go to a "normal" grocery store for.  Not to worry - there's a Fry's just across the street on the Northeast corner of Ray and Dobson.  If you shop here, you will save a *lot* of money compared to shopping at other grocery stores and you'll probably end up with fresher food, too.  So check Sprouts out sometime - you'll be glad you did.

I'm trying to cut down on the number of places that I give five stars to and only give that if a business really, really deserves it, but I have to give five stars to Pho Avina.  They have the best Vietnamese food that I've found in the valley, and I've tried the majority of the Vietnamese restaurants in the heavily Asian part of Chandler (Cyclo, Pho Van, Anise, etc.).  The pho here is absolutely terrific and is really packed full of flavor.  The other dishes I've tried have also all been fantastic, and everyone I've taken here has absolutely loved it.  Seriously, nobody has had a bad dish or a bad experience.  The staff is extremely friendly and if you have questions about anything, they'll spend as much time as you need helping you out, even though it might be in slightly broken English.  Add on to all of this that you can get a huge bowl of pho for $7 and there's really nothing bad that can be said about this place.  Guess what else?  They have boba tea.  I was concerned that when I was living in North Phoenix for a few weeks I wouldn't be able to get boba tea as easily as I could in Chandler, but Pho Avina once again saves the day.  Their boba is a little bit softer than I prefer, but it's still good and definitely worth getting.  Finally, if you're feeling really adventurous, Pho Avina has both durian boba tea and durian ice cream.  I haven't checked, but they may even be able to bring you a small plate of durian if you ask nicely.  For those who don't know, durian is a fruit that grows in Southeast Asia and is known for having one of the most foul odors of anything in the world.  Durians smell so bad that some Asian countries have banned them from subways and other public places, similar to smoking bans.  People either love them or hate them - I personally think durian tastes like a mix of rotten onions and garlic, so I'm not a big fan.  A friend of mine thinks they taste like a mix of feet and death and actually instantly threw up the first time he bit into a piece of the fruit.  Still though, some people absolutely love durian, and it's definitely something worth trying once in your life.  This place has it all, and although I'm moving out of Phoenix in just a few days, I'm going to make damn sure that I visit Pho Avina every time I come back.

Although I live in Michigan these days, I still spend about 20% of my time in Phoenix.  Every time I visit, I make sure I go to Pho Avina at least once or twice.  This is seriously one of my favorite restaurants anywhere, I can't say a single negative thing about it.  The food never fails to amaze me - every meal I've had here has been nothing short of fantastic.  The portions are also very generous, and the food is incredibly inexpensive considering how good it is.  One other thing I have to point out is how awesome the staff is here.  Everyone has always been so friendly and has taken time to answer any questions I might have.  I absolutely love their Vietnamese coffee (I get it black, without condensed milk), and I've never been able to figure out how they make it so flavorful and amazing.  On my last visit to Pho Avina, I asked one of the servers if he could tell me how they make their coffee, realizing that they might not want to disclose their secrets.  He showed me how to use a Vietnamese coffee maker (different from other kinds of coffee makers), wrote down the brand name of the coffee they use (Trung Nguyen), and told me where in Phoenix I could buy both the maker and the coffee.  I was blown away by how forthcoming he was with information and how helpful he was, as many places probably wouldn't do this.  One thing I can say is to make absolutely sure that you eat at the restaurant.  Take out will not be the same, as pho needs to be made and eaten immediately - even a 10 minute wait can have a really drastic impact on its flavor.

Cheap, easy, and good.  I'd only give this place 3.5 stars based on the food, but the low prices make this a good enough value for 4 stars to be justified.  I had a tonkatsu bento, which came with a large helping of katsu (breaded, fried pork), rice, gyoza, kimchi, some noodles, and some other things I'm forgetting.  Everything was pretty good, and the quantity of food was pretty impressive considering it only cost about $8.  This seems like somewhere that would be great for lunch, although I'm sure it's good for a quick dinner too.

We came in at 8:30 on a Saturday night and were literally the only customers in the restaurant.  This seemed like a bad sign and was a bit awkward, but once the food came out, we forgot all about that.  The antipasto salad was good, with ham, pepperoni, and artichoke hearts.  It had a light vinegar dressing with a lot of flavor, but the vinegar wasn't overpowering.  I got the linguine with red clam sauce, which was excellent.  The saltiness of the clams went wonderfully with the sauce, and the linguine was cooked perfectly.  The dish came with two small garlic breadsticks, which were a tasty addition to the pasta dish.  Prices are also very reasonable here - I believe my pasta dish was $12.  And the portions are a good size, with enough that you'll probably have some leftovers to take home.  Definitely a good place to visit when you're up in North Scottsdale!

Very cool place.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the Knife House has a really great selection of high-quality knives.  Even though I didn't come here looking to buy new knives, I still really liked looking at what they had available.  I brought my set of Henckels here to have them sharpened and was really impressed.  It took less than an hour to get them sharpened and only cost $24 for eight knives.  Note that the prices are based on the kind of knife - chef's knives are $5, paring knives are $3, etc.  Now my knives are ridiculously sharp and cut through anything (including my fingers) like warm butter.  They also do knife repair in case your knives are screwed up and need some TLC.  I'm glad to have Phoenix Knife House around, because now I can get my yearly sharpening for my knives done locally and quickly :)

First off - 6022 S. McClintock is apparently their address, although this is a little north of where Amados actually is.  Amados is on the west side of McClintock just a tad north of Guadalupe.  There's a sign out near the street, so it shouldn't be too hard to find.  So what is Amados?  A Mexican joint that's open 24/7 and seriously has some of the best Mexican food you can find.  The carne asada is so so so good, the chile relleno burrito is AWESOME (and I believe it's veggie-friendly for you vegetarian folks out there), their fish tacos are delicious...I could go on and on.  $8 will get you two carne asada burritos, which is a *lot* of food.  They also have a little condiment bar that has excellent red and green salsa, limes, cucumbers, jalapenos, and a bunch of other stuff you might be interested in.  There's a surprisingly decent amount of indoor seating, and there's a little bit of outdoor seating as well.  Amados is basically amazing - I seriously go here at least once a week.  One of the coolest parts is unlike Filiberto's and a bunch of the other taco shops nearby, a trip to Amados won't result in you spending the rest of your day sitting on a toilet.  I've been eating here for years and have yet to get even slightly sick from their food, which is impressive for a 24-hour taco shop.  One warning - late at night (meaning midnight and later), this place can get extremely shady and packed full of people you probably don't want to be around.  During daylight hours though, everything's always very mellow here.  And don't be worried if you don't speak Spanish - the staff here speaks excellent English and is very helpful.

Not so great, especially when you consider that Pho Avina (which is fantastic) is just a couple miles away.  We started with spring rolls which were just fine, but the peanut sauce that came with them seemed watered down to me, which was strange.  I got Pho Dac Biet, which came out *very* quickly.  The broth of the pho was not nearly as flavorful as most other Vietnamese places.  Additionally, some of the pieces of beef in the pho tasted really old, like they had been sitting out for days - ugh.  As Charee M. mentioned, they use the wrong noodles in their pho, which I thought was pretty odd.  After we finished eating they brought out our check and...fortune cookies? At a Vietnamese place?  Weird.  Anyway, save yourself a mediocre meal and go down the street to Pho Avina which is MUCH better.

My belief has always been that at a restaurant, nothing matters but the food.  Service can be abysmal as long as the food is good.  Tandoori Times has changed my beliefs about this, and I now realize that service can be so amazingly terrible that it can completely ruin a dining experience.  Dinner started innocently enough.  We sat at a table not far from the bar, and our server started out asking us what we'd like to drink.  The server had a young kid with her, maybe 5-6 years old, and the kid was helping her with things.  I thought it was kind of strange, but I assumed it was probably our server's kid and that she couldn't find a babysitter for the night or something - no big deal.  I ordered a dirty martini, and our server went back to the bar to mix our drinks (she told us the bartender had already gone home for the night, even though it was only 6PM).  Since our table was near the bar, we could hear what was going on there, and within a minute or two, I heard the server asking the rest of the staff if they knew where the olive juice was.  After a minute or two of searching, the staff concluded that they were out of olive juice.  At this point, I expected our server to come back and ask if she could get me a different drink.  She didn't.  Instead, she started asking the staff what she could substitute for olive juice, and they concluded that saltwater would be good.  Ugh.  She brought me the drink and pretended it was completely normal and nothing was wrong.  I pretended I didn't know any better, took a sip of the drink, and told her it was beyond awful and it tasted like they had used salt instead of olive juice.  She acted like she couldn't imagine why this was, and she said that she would take the drink off of my bill.  When she picked the drink up from the table to take it away, the young kid I mentioned earlier bumped into her and knocked the drink out of her hand.  She spilled a bit of it on me, and most of it on the floor.  She then walked away and offered no help of any kind - no napkins or anything.  This spilled drink stayed on the floor _the entire rest of the meal_, and they never cleaned it up.  When we eventually left, I was tempted to "slip" on it, pretend I severely hurt myself, and start yelling about how careless their staff was, how they could be held liable for injuries, blah blah blah.  I just wanted someone to recognize that it was ridiculous for them to not clean up things that they had spilled, but it really seemed like they didn't care at all.  Anyway, the server asked if I wanted something else to drink instead.  I went for a gin and tonic.  When she got back to the bar, the first thing I heard was "What's in a gin and tonic? How do I make one?" Sigh.  Anyway, the gin and tonic turned out okay, all things considered, but at this point I was pretty sad from what had already happened.  Finally, we got to ordering our food.  Our server came over, asked what we'd like, and as we started telling her, we noticed she wasn't paying any attention.  She was just watching her kid and talking to her.  So, we got to repeat our order again, and this time she actually paid attention and wrote it down.  Yay.  Awhile later, our food came out - we got two naans (one paneer, one chicken), chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, and rice.  The naans were pretty average, nothing really special.  The chicken tikka masala was actually pretty good, and was the only decent part of the whole meal.  The palak paneer was some of the worst I've ever had, and I'm pretty sure they just emptied a defrosted bag of frozen spinach over some cubes of paneer.  It tasted like no spices or any kind of flavoring had been added.  In the middle of eating, we were interrupted by the server and her kid for a rather awkward moment.  The server made her kid apologize for knocking over my drink, and then they walked away.  Congratulations Tandoori Times on making our dinner that much more uncomfortable.  Our server didn't seem to care about anything throughout the whole meal - she never asked how anything was, if we needed anything, etc. When we were done eating, she came by and dropped off the check, without removing our plates from the table or even saying a word.  We had been charged an extra $2.50 just to have rice with our entrees, which I think is pretty ridiculous.  Anyway, I took out my credit card and she came by to pick it up, again without saying a word.  We left quickly, wanting to get our Tandoori Times experience over with as soon as possible.  When we left, I was pretty frustrated and angry, which is not how one should feel when leaving a restaurant.  I will never, ever, ever come back here again.
