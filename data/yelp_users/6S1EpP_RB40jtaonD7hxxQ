The pad thai and yellow curry here are both amazing dishes.  They moved from one location further west in the strip mall to the location they are today.  The only place only had about 6 tables in it, where this place is roughly double in size.    You'll have no trouble getting a table for lunch.  The lunch pricing is reasonable, and the service is quite good.

This is a great place; It is true that the choices for Indian are quite limited in the north and west valley.  This one still makes the cut.  We get take-out here at least twice a month and it is really good.  As the earlier reviews said, the buffet should be avoided, but this is true of mostly all buffets.  There is simply no comparison between mass-market food sitting on steam tables and the dinner dishes prepared to order.  It's a definite "must stop in" if you're on your way through or live in the west valley and you have a craving for Indian food.

This place is a diner in Oakland with standard American fare.  It's not fine dining.  The prices are right and the service is fabulous.    This place is an an institution in Oakland, having been here decades.  It had been remodeled since I was here in 2001, so it is cleaner and snazzier than it was before.    If you want a non-mcdonalds breakfast, and you are in Oakland, this is the place!  Enjoy!

I've been to Hana Sushi about a half dozen times for lunch over the last two years.  The location is very close to where I work and live; I desperately want this place to be perfect, but sadly, it misses the mark.  First, it's closed on Mondays, which is somewhat annoying, because I always seem to forget about that.  I've been there twice on a Monday and had to go somewhere else as a result.  The second problem is that when you go shortly after they open for lunch, they apparently have just started to prepare their rice for the day.  When you order a 2-piece on rice, we don't expect the rice to be warm!  It should be cold, or at least below room temperature.  The mixture of lukewarm rice and cold sushi in my mouth is not appetizing--and this happened every time I went.  The appetizer salad and creamy dressing was quite good, and the service was good as well.  If they could get over the warm rice thing, this could be a better place.

In short, the Grotto was about as close as you can get to fine dining near Fremont street.  My wife and I split the Mahi and Lobster Bisque.  Both were fantastic.    I asked if there would be a plate sharing charge, the waiter says, no, we just require a smile.  They split the bisque into two smaller bowls and they did the same for the dinner.    Everything tasted great and the service was as expected.  They brought out the dessert cart, which included chocolate cake, a cheese cake, a 7 layer strawberry wedding cake and espresso with biscotti.  We had to pass because we were full.  Next time we will get you, dessert cart.  Next time.

For sushi in the north valley, I'd take the drive to Sakana (NWC 59th Ave & 101) over this place.  I've been to this restaurant three times in as many years, and all three times there has been an odd chemical/fish smell when you walk in the door.  I didn't like it the first time, but I'm a believer that you should give a restaurant a couple of chances.  I did, and now I won't go back.  When I ordered their Las Vegas roll, it had scallions inside the roll; I'm not sure if this is usually what is in a Las Vegas roll, but I didn't like it.

I've tried to eat here three times, and only managed to actually get a meal delivered once.  The other two times, I walked in, sat at the counter and couldn't make eye-contact with a server.  They appeared to be too busy to get around to taking my order.  After a 10 minute wait, I left.

Family owned.  Great atmosphere.  Great place to sit outside or inside.  Full selection of latte, tea, frappes and a few cupcakes.  Love it!

We were on the way out of Las Vegas on Friday morning, and we yelped a place for breakfast.  Mr. Mama's will not disappoint.  The prices are right and the service was friendly and fast.  We will definitely be here again the next time we're in town!

I can't say enough about this place.  It's open late (but not on Mondays...watch it!) and it is good comfort food.  I always eat the Seafood Bibim Bap (Haemul Dolsot Bibim Bap) and it is excellent!  They bring you several sides of vegetable dishes, along with the main dish sizzling in a hot stone bowl.  If you like Korean food -- or want to try it -- this is the place to go.  Enjoy!

I really can't say anything bad about Du Par's.  It is a diner in the first floor of a Fremont Street casino.  What are we expecting here, caviar and truffles?  They have a standard breakfast, lunch and dinner menu that you would expect for diner fare.  The 'bakery' part of their name must refer to the selection of pies for dessert.  I bet this place would be awesome for pie and coffee.  We have had the coffee, but we haven't had the pie yet.  Next time.  Our server seemed to be a little impersonal, but she also was juggling multiple tables, so I'll give her a mulligan on that one.  When I asked how the first chandelier cracked (it was glued) she laughed it off and said she didn't know, but that when we came in the next time, she would have a good story for us.  Pancakes?  Yes, I hear they are good, but too many carbs for me.  I saw pancakes on about every other plate in there when I walked in, so they must be good.

The service is outstanding and the drinks are outstanding.  Phoenix suburbians unite!  We must support all the locally-owned non-chain businesses we can!  If you don't want all chain restaurants in the suburbs, you have to support the family-owned places as much as you can.  Skip Starbucks and go here.  If you're in a hurry, check their website, they have text-based ordering where you can text your order in advance so they can have it ready for you.  They can also tie your phone number to a pre-paid account so that you don't even have to have cash or credit ready.  Very tech-savvy place.  Highly recommend!

This place was actually better than I expected after reading the Yelp reviews.  We were the first customers here on January 1 when they opened at 11:00.  It was a little confusing, because they don't appear to have table service, however, if you sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chef will take your order and act like your waiter.  If not at the sushi bar, you have to go to the register and order.  It is a take out place that looks like a sit down restaurant.  Don't let that deter you, though, the food was great.  My wife got the mochiko chicken and I got salmon rolls and Mackaral rolls and they were good.
