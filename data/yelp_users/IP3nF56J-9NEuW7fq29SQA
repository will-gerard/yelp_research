The atmosphere here is just so cool. Even if you don't like Alice cooper the rock and roll feel is all around. The staff wears Alice cooper-esque outfits and even the makeup!   This is a huge restaurant and there was plenty of room to sit, mind you there wasn't a game on when we went.   My friend and I both had the Marge Simpson Mac and cheese, it was heavenly. They put some tiny pieces of potato chips on top and it's just excellent.  The service was quick and friendly. I really enjoyed my time here. It's a great restaurant for families, couples or singles and looks like it would be a decent bar in the evenings. Sort of reminds me of the Hard Rock Cafe, but I like this place better.

The staff is friendly and there are some good deals at times.   The pharmacy is a little confusing, the staff in there doesn't seem to communicate well. I switched to a different birth control and they kept giving me the old perscription too until I pointed it out.  Regular walgreens, has most everything you would want/need from a convenience store.

This is a very nice church. It is beautiful, though the top of the alter is a TINY bit gaudy. They say the nicean creed, which isn't the one that I know, but they do provide a program with it in.  There were a lot of people wearing JEANS, which in Canada would be completely unacceptable. It was kind of cool to see such a relaxed church. The sermon really touched me and I enjoyed it, however I am under a lot of stress.  The stain glass windows are beautiful!! The ceiling has these gorgeous tiny stained glass windows.  Somehow, the host had a sort of citrus taste. Overall this is a good Catholic church. I think I will return.

I am in love and it's with a restaurant. I came here after a difficult week to treat myself to a fancy lunch. I ordered the soup and sandwich combo-on the weekend you can't get the deal price though FYI. It was of course delicious. If it's your first time here try the pizza though, BBQ chicken is my favorite.  They have a nice wine selection, I really likes the house chard. You can order a regular or large sized glass.   I say at the bar and talked to the bar tender who was super sweet and didn't make me feel like a big loser for sitting alone.  This is a great location for a wonderful restaurant, I will go again for sure!

I won't be coming back here. They told me that the reason my design looked so bad was because it was hard to do...

I went after work on a Thursday and a few of my coworkers bowed out because they are sick of Mexican food. I am so glad that I didn't! The ambiance is cute and there are pictures of the family who own the joint on the walls, some are really cool looking. They have imported Mexican beers that were all great, we tried three of them.   The food is the best Mexican I have had in a very long time. It isn't just smothered in cheese and beans and called Mexican. It tastes like heaven on a plate and still did the next day when I had my leftovers for lunch!   The service was excellent and courteous. I will definitely come here again and again!!

This is a cute Starbucks, nice staff, pretty speedy service. They have a tiny patio area and it's basically just the sidewalk in front of the store.  It was very busy when I went but it was raining for once in phoenix. The service was speedy and though it was packed, still friendly. I know I'm repeating myself but I have no patience when it comes to slow baristas.   There was a lot of space in the shared lot to park and lots of seating available inside even considering the large crowd hiding from the rain.

I went to this salon based on yelp reviews alone, I was terrified but it was great. Everyone was super nice and friendly. Alex cut my hair and we discussed what I wanted and he pulled it off amazingly.   My favourite part was the massage I got when he was washing my hair, he massaged my head and neck and I felt so relaxed!! It was awesome:).   Parking- you can park in the back, there are spots and a huge parking garage which is awesome.   They also have free wifi and cold water. They use all bumble and bumble products which is great too.   My cut was 50 dollars, which is a bit more than I had wanted to pay and I have easy hair, but I do love the results! Thanks yelp for the recommendation!

I brought in 3 repairs and paid 3 dollars!  Back home that would've been at least 15 bux each!   So first of all they are very reasonably priced. Second of all they do a good job of dry cleaning, efficient and you can even do drive through.   Finally, I had a few dresses taken in here and she did a wonderful job! Very precise and professional. Again at a reasonable price. The seamstress is great and will look for any button or other fabric that you need to make your clothing truly yours.  I have already been here twice and I will be back!

I loved this place! First off, there's a five dollar cover when they have a live band, which is most of the time. BUT if you don't have cash don't worry, the bouncer will take a card and start a tab.  I went here with a couple of friends for a bite and some wine. We got a bottle for a reasonable price (around 20 bux) and some appetizers. The flatbread was great and the cheese fondue was, well I couldn't stop eating it!! The pizza we got was the first one on the list, I forget the name but I'll never forget that TASTE YUM!!  The band was great, Jazz but not that smooth jazz radio stuff, like the cooler songs that you've heard but aren't super annoying. The singer had a great voice! The weird entrance is cool, but does make this place a little tricky to find. If you can't find it, ask a golfcart driver, they know everything!  There are couches and tables and chairs but the stones on the walls and the newspaper looking stained glass, really makes you feel like you are in some elite club or something. The crowd is honestly a true mixed bag, old and young, dates and friends and singles. I will totally come here again and again!! Great way to start off or end a night.

Eggs are bad other food is pretty good.  This place is nothing special, they try and are friendly but the eggs are gross, as is the coffee. Home Fries and such are pretty decent.  The atmosphere is nice and homey and very country. Seats are comfortable and no real complaints. But for the most part the food is bad. I will not return intentionally

Part of my family is German and let me say this is definitely authentic food! The food is good and the beers are large. Everything is large. When you go, be prepared to take home a lot of food. I ordered the wiener snitzel and when it came I was overwhelmed. It fed me dinner for three nights!  The service was friendly but a bit confused. They didn't ask if we were ready to order, we had to ask to order and then they didn't ask the whole table but went back and forth putting orders in one at a time.  My friend had the kilometre, which was a huge sausage with a bit of spice to it. It was about 2 feet long!   The atmosphere is cute and very pub like. The waiters are all dressed in German attire and they are playing German music.   I would return again.

Patio patio patio! It's spectacular! Great for group gatherings. I love their cocktails as well and they have an awesome Bloody Mary bar on Sunday's!  Some of the food is just bar food but I personally love the hot vings and their Mac and cheese is so buttery smooth. You definitely feel like you've put on a few pounds. Their full menu has a lot of good stuff on it but I'm usually here for happy hour.  They are always happening but never super crowded, when I've been anyways and you always feel like you're well taken care of. For happy hour rotations I'd reccommend the vig!

I was there last night and although they only have beer and wine, they have TWO DOLLAR pbr!!! Amazing for someone on a tight budget. I went out with only 20 dollars and was able to be as drunk as I wanted to.   This is a bar for drunk people, when you are sober it is too loud and too crowded and there is no a/c. Once you start to get your buzz going though its awesome.  The girl to guy ratio is pretty good but lots of bearded dudes and a large age range from 20s-40s but more heavy on the 20-30s.  This bar attracts a LOT of hipsters, and a few handfuls of regular folk. Very casual and the outside part makes you feel like you are at a friends house party.

Update, beer and wine only- they were very offended and then refused to serve my friend and I anymore when we asked for a well drink. Sorry, most bars have a wider selection.   Also the music that was playing live was pretty bad, but that's what you get with live music I guess.

Sunday breakfasts are nostalgia and happiness all wrapped into one. This place has it.  I went here this morning to treat myself to a breakfast and a coffee. I had the French press, and even though it was just a regular old coffee, it was incredible. By regular I mean non-latte or anything like that. It was honestly what heaven tastes like, one of the absolute BEST coffees I've had in phoenix since moving here, possibly the best.  For breakfast I ordered the biscuits and gravy and being greedy and hungry went for the full instead of the half. I think I would have been satiated with the half though, it is rather filling.  It did take a whole to come out but I was able to sit by the adorable fountain in the lovely courtyard and I barely even noticed the time lapse.   The biscuits and gravy were awesome! Just enough sauce so it wasn't making the biscuits too soggy but they were still smothered. They sprinkle cinnamon on top and that enhances the flavor.  The staff was friendly and the wifi was free, the ambiance was slightly hipster but very relaxing and just like a coffee shop for everyone. I will be coming back here again for sure and I think before I leave I will get another coffee to go!

I love this einsteins!! It's somewhat busy but Mishelle does a great job of making sure everyone gets what they want in a timely manner! The asiago bagels are heavenly and their coffee is pretty good too, comparable with Starbucks. They don't have free wifi which is the only downer.

I love this location of Einstein's!! The manager Mishelle is awesome and always remembers my name. The bagels are fresh and good. The coffee is a bit pricey for what it is but there is a Starbucks next door. They don't have wifi but like I said there is a Starbucks next door. The parking is ample because of the Safeway parking lot and I've never had to wait long at this location. Great for breakfast on the weekend.  My favorite is  the turkey sausage sandwich on asiago.

No parking! There's about three spots for the whole place so I'd suggest you park at hula's down the street (also a great spot).   They have $3 sangria on happy hour, I prefer the white but they have both and they do come chalk full of fruit bits.  I've been here twice. One time I had the strawberry fields salad which was huge, and delicious. Very fresh and summery. I also had the spinach dip, it was also very tasty.   I love this place and it has a cool vibe. They even have take home bottles of wine. It is pretty tiny though.   Would be 5 stars but the parking.

I love this hike! It is long but you have options, you can take a shorter route or turn around sooner and the views are spectacular.   The paths are a bit rough and rocky so I would NOT recommend it for beginners. However kids seem to be the ones running up or down! It can be a bit bust but it's not as bad as camelback mountain.  Dog friendly, if you don't want to see a dog, don't go. If you have a small dog though, they could tire out.

I love this place. Traditional Irish bar, divey like you feel like you could run into your third grade teacher here and it's be totally chill.  It's never too crowded but there's always a crowd. Live music by a gruff old dude, sometimes a super hipstery band that plays acoustic type and Irish type music. I come here when I just want a drink and to be reminded of home. It really reminds me of the places back east and in canada( where I'm from)  Cheers! Try the full moon if you like blue moon!!

The food is great, well the bruschetta was but our service was horrible and because of that I will not go back. The manager did comp some of the meal but it took half an hour for bruschetta...and our waiter blatantly ignored out table, it was insane. The pub board is nothing special and the chorizo wasn't spicy at all and it was something that even I could've thrown together. The soup of the day was alright, again nothing special.   The beer that we got a "pitcher" of only filled two glasses, that's not a pitcher. Like I said I won't return.  The atmosphere is very romantic and the decor was cool.

I also got a groupon for a massage.  The reason I am giving a low rating is that the guy massaged my butt a lot and it made me super uncomfortable. They also used so much massage oil that it got all over my clothes.  I'm not sure if it's a normal thing to massage your behind but he didn't even ask me!

Great coffee with those cute designs in the foam! I like the atmosphere here, it is very work oriented. A bit hipster but it has free wifi and these cool laptop tables. It's not too loud or annoying. This is my new fave!! Try the honey vanilla late. Prices are a bit high but worth it:)

They have toned down the music a bit, which is great so now I might start coming here more often. I am here pretty early though and the wifi seems to have gotten a bit slower, and it is less busy so that doesn't really make sense. The staff is still awesome and I tried the quiche goat cheese and veggie which was delicious.

I got an awesome pedi! I am super ticklish but they managed to do a good job and make my feet look great without making me feel uncomfortable. They also include a massage with oil for your legs which is heavenly.  I gave 4 stars because you can't have a conversation with your aesthetician because the language barrier is real.   The chairs are massaging too which was pretty relaxing and it was all just 17 dollars plus tip.  I would recommend!

Got my nails done here and I love the results. It was 25 dollars to get a design on two fingers and my gel nails filled, but it is the coolest my nails have ever looked. The lady who does the designs will even work with you when you have different suggestions.

Pros: they use a type of beeswax so there is a minimal amount of pain, they are very professional while grooming your ladybits, they offer reasonable packages for the year, they call and remind you the day before your appointments.  Cons: once you're in with a waxer for a while and you try another it's kind of hard to switch because they are all friends, the girls at the front desk kind of pressure you to tip and make you feel uncomfortable, there's not really much in that plaza to do if you get there early.  Overall I like this place and I go here all the time. They don't do a perfect job though but I think it's the wax they use

Tried to go here on Saturday during what were posted as normal business hours. I called a few times and kept getting the answering machine and then decided to go over. The doors were locked and there were sorry we missed you notices from the post office on the door. I walked around the back and a guy was there who had the building next door and said that they just weren't open today he guessed. I thought Saturdays would be the most busy time for a hair salon? It was odd and I ended up taking my business elsewhere.

This bar is really cool. They have a wide range of activities and areas to hangout in. You can play ping pong or hula hoop, be inside or outside and there's a section that you can pay 5 dollars to enter where you get all you can eat pancakes.   There is also a huge boxing ring in the middle of everything, it's cool but so disappoints that you can't go in it.   The dj played top 40 stuff and a few random 90s songs.   The drinks are strong but don't taste amazing, the lemonade shot is gross. The other drinks were fine and they have 3 dollar beers and 6 dollar shots. They don't id you until you try to get a drink which is annoying because they make you show if every time.   There is a large hipster population here and if you dress too fancy you will stand out.   The only other complaint I have is it was super girl heavy in there with a few unattractive guys. It may not be like that every night though. The hula hoopers made it difficult for the tiny dance floor to fill up. Once they stopped it was pretty good. I had fun but it got old after a while so we moved on to another bar.

Can you say strong comeback?  The first time I went here, I didn't like it. There was too much bread and not enough filling. Maybe that was because I got it to go? Anyways the flavors were good but the bread overtook everything because there was just too much of it.  I had been working and hadn't ate all day aka I was hungry AF. I had to stop somewhere so I decided to give this place a second chance. Wow? Was I right to do so! I ordered the bear dog and it was awesome! The bread was not overwhelming because they had put enough toppings on it to fill the tray. It was delicious! I will definitely return here!

I went to this place for free with an event. It is the coolest bowling alley I've ever been to. The drink that I had (deception) was alright, not good enough for its price(10$). The lanes have really cute graphics that change so you don't see that same thing over and over each time you make or don't make a strike. Every person who bowls gets a graphic popping up which is nice. The food is typical bar far and decent. Again nothing amazing but it fits the bill.   There are a ton of people there and you can play pool. It feels like a bar that is also a bowling alley. The girl at the front has an accent and it was somewhat hard to understand her. I would go here again and pay this time!

Super chill vibe but it had a ton of famjams going on when I went in.  The restaurant does not feel like you are in the bar even though they are attached. I will eat here again!

The pancakes, though they sound like a strange combination of flavours, are actually delicious! I would definitely come here again. I also got a chai latte, which was decent but not as good as songbirds.  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is the service was pretty slow. I was completely finished my coffee by the time my breakfast finally arrived.  Atmosphere is cool and if you are having breakfast or any meal alone, you won't feel like a huge loser sitting there on your own because of how it's set up. Very hipstery but that's kind of everywhere around here. Be warned you may run into the lost leaf bartender here.

This Sunday, I decided to try the biscuits and gravy. The actual biscuits and gravy were very tasty as were the potatoes, but the eggs were a bit of a miss. One was undercooked to the point that I wondered if I should eat parts of it and the other one was slightly overlooked. I know it can be difficult to cook eggs...  But try for some more consistency.

Are you one of the following?: dirty hippie, hipster, organic gardener, whole foods frequenter, vegan, gluten-free, lactose-free, summertime winter hat wearer? Then this place is for you. My friend who was with me also said that the attractiveness of the clientele was above average, but he is from Tucson.  They are awesome with any allergy or strange dietary request. The food is all locally sourced blah blah blah.   Very smelly hippie atmosphere, girls with dreadlocks and socks with sandals.   I had the pizza with the eggplant and bri. I loved it. I also had some kind of carrot tasting smoothie, it was alright but nothing to write home about. Apparently my organs will now function better due to that one drink...  My friends had the lasagna, gluten free of course and they loved it. My mom had the fish tacos and she eats them everywhere she goes. She raved about the flavor.  Overall this restaurant is good food-wise but a little too "I drive a Prius why don't you, environment destroyer??!!" For my tastes.

Good movies just like home, no pressure to put on makeup or anything. The seats are super comfortable and the atmosphere is super homey. Every movie I've seen there has been awesome!! The owner has great taste.  You can get a beer and popcorn, which is awesome in my opinion. What more can I say? Buy your tickets in advance and enjoy a great movie with friends or on your own.

I've been here a few times and I like this bar overall. There are a lot of business people who go and that makes it feel a little classier than gypsy. They have a huge beer selection and the drinks are pretty tasty. They are a bit pricey though.  They always have live music and the band plays above the main bar and it's really cool looking. I'd say this bar is less dancey and more chill at a bar stool/table etc.   The only other real downside, other than the price is that it tends to be a real taco fest, so if you're a single lady that can be disappointing.  Everything is clean and elegant. It is a bit more upscale than most bars around there, but you will fit in wearing jeans and a t-shirt or a dress with heels. It is a little less hipster full than the usual too so I enjoy it when I'm sick of the hipster scene at lost leaf.

The whole dog prints everywhere and dog treats at the front, made me pretty hesitant, I mean dogs and food together?? Weird.  However, I didn't see a single dog there, mind you it was Friday night. We were able to get a table for four quickly with no problem. I really enjoyed the atmosphere it's very homey and cozy and not too fancy.   The food and drinks came quickly and our server was awesome. My friend and I each ordered some ohso brews. Mine, the white elephant was super hoppy so I didn't like it and it never said that it would be in the description. My friend got the groovy and it was watery tasting, yuck!   To eat, I had the brisket which was great! The crunchy onions and sauce just make it. My friend who also ordered the brisket, had her bun come out burnt. It's not that hard to toast a bun dudes... Our other friends had the chicken sandwich and they said it was awesome.  I would come here again, despite the dogs but next time I'll stick to water!

I stopped in here to get my eyebrows done. It was quick and Nicole did a good job. I haven't tried them for other services however.  There were a lot of people speaking Spanish in there. The decor was cute but a little cheap looking. However the price was right! The place is very small but cozy and I would go back to get my eyebrows done. I'm not sure about a haircut but I don't trust people with my hair.  Easy to find and it wasn't very busy. They do accept walk-ins.

This is an overall decent place. I absolutely love the decor and the music they had playing was very cool. Definitely very hipstery and casual. Lots of bearded men.  I had a Moscow mule to drink and it was awesome! It had the real spicy quality to it that I personally love.   It is a very small venue and it was pretty packed with no where to sit really. I liked the vibe of this place but it was definitely lacking in hotties!! Too many beards for my taste, and shaved heads, since when is that attractive. Anyways it's a decent place to chill with friends and they have a pretty sweet game area in the back.

The place is da bomb.com/wickedawesome . I know the parking lot is annoying but you can get in from the other side, by give guys or park by pei way and walk over.   They have a few rolls on special for happy hour which I love- slammin salmon is the best or the three alarm if you like spicy. Everything is fresh and tasty and you can make your own rolls like you would at a chipotle or subway. That's great but if your not so creative like me they do have a traditional menu. It's a convenient spot near downtown and is very casual. I'd feel comfortable here on a date or just on my own.

Looks gross from the outside, I was so hesitant when my friend suggested this place for dinner!   When you walk in, it is pretty cute looking. Casual dining but cute decor and clean.   I ordered tacos and my friend had the quesadilla. The best part was the fresh tortillas which were fried up on the grill and nice and crispy! The carnitas I has were delightful but very greasy. The grease was dripping all over, gross. It didn't impact the taste too much however.  I had rice and beans on the side. They were not tasty. A little overcooked I think. I couldn't even eat them and I'm not too picky.  To drink they have everything you could imagine and traditional Mexican faire. I had horchata which was good. Very cinnamony and heavy.

Five guys is great. Their presentation is lacking but the food is good. If you are in the mood for a burger this is the place to go.  Try to think about what you want on it though before you get to the front of the line. The manager at this particular five guys was really friendly and seemed to actually enjoy working there.  As always there are free peanuts to munch on while you wait for your meal.  To drink they have the regular soft drinks and yea. The fries are great as well, crispy and not too salty.  If you need to get a meal on your own you can sit at a Hightop without feeling like a total loser.

I like this bar. Cheap drinks, a full arcade and lively people, isn't that all you want in a bar? I had a lot of fun here and my tab ended up being so cheap.  The drinks are strong and not amazing but they will get you hammered. There was also live art being done by the dj booth when I was there which was mesmerizing.  The crowd is mixed, not too young not too old and there is a good guy to girl ratio, it was fairly even. I will definitely go here again.

I tried this gym for the first time and I loved it. They do totally push you until you want to barf but if you want a great workout I would definitely recommend this place. You wear a heart rate monitor and it tells you how you are doing by the second on a big screen. The amount of time you're supposed to be in each zone is a little confusing but the trainers are always willing to discuss your results at the end. Some trainers are better than others but I've only had two and I enjoyed class with both of them.

Devon pushed me to have almost 10 minutes in the orange zone. I think the zones are a bit higher than they need to be sometimes and it gets harder and harder to hit those zones the more fit you get/the more you go.  Remember that the zones are based on an average person's heart and if you have a better or worse heart, your results will reflect that.   The treadmill doesn't even get me to orange anymore and I feel like I'm not doing well but my fitness is improving each time.

They've added belly, this points accumulating key card that's free where you can get to do things and get free stuff when you get a certain amount of points. One of them was to choose the playlist/bring your own to the class and another was to make your instructor do 10 burpees. I thought if everyone won that and got the instructor to do 10 burpees in one class...but I'm a little evil sometimes. I really do want to win one of their cute tank tops though.  They have also remodelled the bathrooms since my last review and they removed the box of emergency tampons from the women's bathroom which is unfortunate.   It has become much busier since my first review so make sure you book online at least a few days in advance! Remember to ask for the family discount if anyone you are related to goes as well:)  Keep fit and have fun!

They've added belly, this points accumulating key card that's free where you can get to do things and get free stuff when you get a certain amount of points.

Just had my first class with Marisa. She is also great. A very different style of teaching. She is all about the positive reinforcement. I loved it when she (tried to) say my name and tell me I was doing great for being in the orange zone so quickly.   Ps everyone it's pronounced k-ear-sten not kursten...Bryan

Wow, we got absolutely terrible service. The only reason that this place is getting more than one star is that the good was great.   When we first sat down, I asked about the happy hour specials and was told what they were but that we couldn't get them and would have to pay full price because we were seated inside. I told the hostess three times that I wanted outside as he was bringing us in, but I didn't want to make a fuss about it. We asked to be moved and the girl said that would not be possible, but what we could do is go to the bar. My friend and I went up to the bar to get our happy hour specials while our third friend who doesn't drink waited at the table. While we were getting out drinks three different people came up to my friend who was still at the table asking what the problem was and where we were and what we were doing. They were so rude to her she wanted to leave.  Pro-tip: if you offer different prices at different spots in your restaurant people will go for the cheapest.  The rest of the time the waitress was very rude to us and even ignored me several times when I asked for our check. I don't want to come back here if I can help it.

Was here last night, briefly. The server did not take orders in the order that people got there which was frustrating! We waited about 20 minutes and then left.  The crowd is very young, the music is typical club stuff and it has the feel of a 12 year olds party where they found their parents liquor. Very disorganized, would not recommend for a bar.    I have not tried their food yet.

This is a great bar, not too busy, but enough people to have a good time. The music is excellent for my dance moves and the drinks are cheap. There's lots of space to sit down too and a stage on the dance floor if you're into that. Just a warning, this is a gay bar so be aware and dance your bum off!

This is a cute little Italian joint. My friend and I went at 645 and it was busy but we barely had to wait 10 minutes and they suggested that we stop in at the turf for a drunk first(the bar next door). It was nice in there but a lot of green lighting, which doesn't really make anyone look good. We got our table and sat outside. The service was quick but not very careful. At first when our pizza came out, there were no plates, napkins or the toppings they are supposed to bring  with it. We asked for those things and the napkins didn't show up until we were almost finished.  The pizza was delicious, we got the one that starts with an a, I don't recall the exact name. I would defiantly eat here again.   One other thing was we both ordered a glass of the White House wine and it tasted like what I imagine pee tastes like. It was pretty gross, I'd suggest you splurge a little and go for a more expensive wine, you will probably have better luck.

So I still love short leash but am very disappointed in one thing.  They stopped making the chips in house!:( they were so tasty!!   They did extend the patio and add more seating which is nice. They're definitely not skimping on the beer can selection.  I've tried the Mac and cheese which is good but nothing to die for. The dogs I love are still the bear, devil dog and aiko. They do a great job with the doughnuts too. I'd just like too see them up their sides game.

Bloody Mary bar, so I can finally make a Cesar (if you're from canada you know what I mean) except for clamato juice.  $4 Bloody Mary bar and $15 mimosas unlimited for the whole day! Awesome.  I went for brunch with a friend and it has a really cool atmosphere. Relaxed bar type, but I wore a dress and heels and didn't feel out of place.   I had the corned beef hash to eat. The best part about it was the sauce. The egg was undercooked in a few spots-gross. Other than that it was good but I'd say the drinks here far overtake the food in quality.   My friend ordered the encanto enchilada and loved it.  Will come again, probably just for drinks next time.

This place is centrally located and I love it! It started out as a food truck and has kept that same down home type flavour.   I went with two other people and we each got a cocktail, they were all very good and refreshing. I had the kimchi one, I forget the name but it tasted kind of like a spicy Bloody Mary.  They had gluten free pizza for my allergic sister and she said the gluten free was awesome.   We shared slices and every pizza was to die for. Heavenly, if you are craving some home cooked tasting pizza with an excellent flavor combination, this is the place to go. It wasn't super busy but we did go on a weeknight.  The service was quick and friendly. The chairs were super comfy and the misters were misty.

I came here for lunch with friends. First impression: it is beautiful inside and makes me want to ask them to decorate my house! The service was quick and friendly and the server was happy to recommend a dish when I was humming and haaing. Mind you, it was pretty dead, I think there were about 3 tables with people at them.  We had hummus and baba ghanoush to start. They did not bring enough pitas at first, but brought a refill when we asked. Both dips were good and the pita bread was hot.  Then we shared the special Greek salad. The chicken had a great rub on it! I'm glad we shared though because it was HUGE.  I had Jenny's penne for my entree which is a spicy penne with chicken. It was very good. My friends had the chicken masala and the beef kabab which they both thoroughly enjoyed.   We also were lucky enough to try some of the mixed drinks. My favourite was the mojito relative that they do.

I had a great experience here and I'm a little confused as to the large number of negative reviews. The staff was polite and pretty speedy. They didn't make any mistakes on my order and there were lots of spots to sit. I used to love going to panera in Florida and this one is so far up to that standard.   I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup pick 2, the grilled cheese was excellent, the tomato soup was acceptable. It was a bit more tomatoey than basil flavored. I also had an iced chi which was incredible!   I did spend some time observing the staff and they do look like they are not too experienced but the manager came out and helped when there was a little rush at 2pm.   I have no real complaints, I will be back.

You do have to wait a while for your order but it is reasonably priced and the wings are decent.  I had medium and they were fine. Pretty good for wings, I had no complaints, I want over the moon though.  They have medium on the menu but it isn't listed. The servers are very nice. I wouldn't eat in, it's just not cozy in there. For the most part decent wings.

I stopped in for lunch during the week. The menu is short, but everyone enjoyed their food. Warning: if you order a bowel it is huge! If ordering tacos I would say get 2-3 or you will be wanting more. I had the tamale and it was very tasty. I wouldn't say life changing but decent.  The ambiance was great and the service was very friendly. They also have an extensive patio and outdoor area that looked nice, but it was 110 so we didn't venture outside. I also really loved the decor, really cool looking light fixtures.  The reason I am only giving 4 stars is the drinks. The water they served us had this salty or metallic taste-yuck. The margaritas we ordered were so weak they tasted like a 7-11 slurpie and the pitcher didn't even full 5 drinks.

I love this place! They are the only place that takes care in doing my nails and does a decent job for an acceptable price. The tenth fill is free and they do a nice pedicure too. They can do any nail design that you show them a picture of which I love.

They know how to do any design that you show them a photo of. Though they sometimes seem confused because of the language barrier, they can really do anything you show them. Both the man and the woman are awesome artists!!

I was super hungry and decided to come here because I love the one downtown. The service was prompt and my hotdog was what I expected, if a little worse than the original. I was so disappointed when I got the chips and they weren't made on site.  I was there alone, sitting at the bar and after I placed my order the two employees played on their phones the entire time! At least attempt some conversation. This one also did not have alcohol.

Have you ever been to a bowling alley, but wondered if it could be golf-focused? That is top golf in a nutshell. It isn't cheap, about 35 bucks per hour but it's nice to practice and you can go with nothing and the wrong clothes  and zero experience and still have fun.  I went with my dad, an accomplished golfer and he loved it. You can aim for a target that your skill level can hit and earning points for your shots is cool. The view of the mountains is pretty spectacular too.   It's also great for kids, there's a game room on the lower level for them and a bar mid-level for the adults. Drinks and food are hella pricey. That's snottsdale for you though.  You can bring your own clubs but they have ones there that are decent too.

This used to be a club I'm sure and it wasn't a good one.  We purchased a groupon and were told we needed to make reservations. Defiantly not needed, there were more staff in the joint than customers.  The service was friendly and quick, but they didn't seem very knowledgable.  The reason why I am only giving two stars is the description for the wines did not at all match the wines that they brought us. The first two were fine, but both of our third wines were undrinkable. They tasted like they had gone bad, that really alcoholic sour taste...gross. We told this to our waiter who just walked away and didn't say anything...weird.  Finally, we left a cash tip on the table, and redeemed out groupon. Our waiter chased after us and told us that we had to pay an additional 4 dollar service fee. I instantly regretted leaving that tip and half wanted to ask for it back.  I would not go there again.  Oh we also had the toasted bruschetta, which was a little burnt and nothing that tasted amazing.

There's an expectation when you go here. It should be at least as good as crudo. It wasn't.  Cocktails and atmosphere were great.  We had the fried chicken, it was super greasy and in tiny portions. We ordered corn bread on the side and thank god we did because the cornbread muffin they gave us was teeny tiny. The cornbread was thin and dry, it's like they tried to make it prestigious but it made it dried up and not great tasting.   We also had a focaccia. It wasn't a focaccia. It was a pizza. It had good flavor, a nice honey glaze on the sausage. The middle of the pizza was soggy!! Gross. I hope they get better but I'm not sure that we will return. I was honestly hoping for more BBQ options on the menu.

The place was clean and modern. Staff were courteous and friendly.  I got a pedicure. They did a nice job and I had a good talk with my nail tech. They used a really nice feeling scrub and an oil based moisturizer. However my feet didn't feel super moisturized afterwards. The pedicure was not super ticklish which is great for me.   My only real complaint is the vegan, gluten free, no animal testing polish, doesn't last. I'd recommend bringIng your own polish.
