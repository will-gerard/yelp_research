Love, love Ide Mania and everyone working there... I've known Ide and the entire family for over 16 years... I'm ready for a change and guess where I'm going...IDE.  You can also get a facial, nails and relax while Ms. Gina does your makeup... she is a makeup extraordinaire...  If you are new in town, or being here a while and your hair stylist is not cutting it... go to Ide Mania...don't waste your time... Plus they use Aveda...yeah.

This is a difficult one, because I use to love Aunt Chilada's.  So here's what happened yesterday.  My family decided after much talk that we wanted mexican food, so I suggested AC, because even though I haven't been there in like 3 years, I us to love the food and service.  When we arrived around 3pm, we notice that there were hardly anyone there, my husband thought that was strange.  We decided to sit inside because the outside looked pretty lonely.  The guy at the door directed us to the right of the restaurant, there were one group of two ladies, that were leaving and us... so we wait, and wait, and wait... then a group of about 4 people sat down, and we still waiting... I notice that we didn't even have water, we looked around and there were two girls sitting to what it looks like the back area, complaining and talking, I know cause they were loud.  Out of know where comes this waiter and completely bypass us and went straight to the table that came after us... My husband looked at me got up and we left... that's when the waiter said hi... it was so bad.  What I also noticed is how dirty this place is, the fixture have pounds of dust, everything is dusty and looks dingy, so my though was, what is going on here, my husband responded, if this place looks this bad, I wonder about kitchen... sad, so sad, WHAT HAPPENED TO AUNT CHILADAS...WE ARE NEVER COMING BACK.  Down the street is Los Reyes de la Torta, is on a little strip mall, but the place is clean, service is impeccable and food was amazing... at least something good came out of all this.

I will start this review with saying that The Garcia on 35th Avenue is the only one you should go to.... this location was a huge disappointment...the only reason I give it a 2 star is because the service was good...our server was really nice, we had the tortilla soup, salad, and a grande burrito, I think... Let me start with the burrito...aside of onions and the dried chicken and beef inside, there was nothing to this... I think I make 100% better mexican food than this people, and I'm from Panama--LOL... now the soup, yak... horrible and the salad, had a big peace of lettuce that looked like fungus was growing on it... my little one gagged... I almost complained, but what's the point, we are never going there again... better off going to and Humberto, Roberto, Filiberto...whatever you called those places... believe me you will never be this disappointed.

Let me start with, I love Souper Salad, being going to them for at least 16 yrs... the problem I have it's with this location by Metro Mall... seriously dirty, the floors, the tables...the booth, nasty.  I can't even imagine what the kitchen looks like.  I just can't do this place ever again.  Either the people there just don't care about cleaness because is still a good price, or they just as nasty.  This Souper Salad needs help bad --- remodeling, cleaning and nice people to work, cause the waitress we got was either not happy to be there or plainly just a b - i - t %&^^ you get my point.

Food was really good, they do have splenda...(kid with diabetes) is a most for us.  The service we got was excellent... my only gripe, is at the door when you are trying to get a table, they need to figure out a better way to handle that... empty tables on a Sunday, with pack waiting area is not good.

I will forever be a fan... the food, the people that work there...the atmosphere...is just gooooooooooooooooooood.  My only gripe with this place is parking...not that is difficult, but if you are not familiar with the area...you will have a hard time finding some.    My other only suggestion will be to open a location in Glendale...

Okay, the only reason I'm not giving this place a complete 5 star is because of the I'm too good to be serving you waitress we got... I think she forgot she makes tips for a living or maybe she is rich and just works for the hell of it... either way, the food is fantastic and if you can avoid the brown hair girl medium length-  tall girl, your experience should be fantastic... love the way is all set up.

I give this place a 5 star, because of the service... and the Fresh squeezed Margarita...OMG, the best.  Our waiter, all I remember that he was Black and puerto rican... funny, gives excellent service, friendly...   We ordered soups, and the fresh bread sandwich...and all of it was delish... price was okay . but nothing like Fuego del Mar...(don't go there).    I'm going back for sure... my family and I agree this was a great place to visit.

I had nothing but great service... food is excellent and now with the light rail I can actually enjoy a ride to Tempe, without the long ride there.  The best is the lettuce wraps, and to be honest with you, after I eat that, I don't even have to have dinner, just drinks...

Not my extreme favorite, but this place is good for a nice date or even a first date... Food was good...  I was there for a get together birthday party, I found it rather small for that type of event... but otherwise...good

I love this Petsmart, a girl name Amber cuts my little girl's hair and it always looks amazing.  The price is okay, I wish I could get coupons to help with ticket price.  But, when she comes out, she looks amazing.  I love the service, the people, the vet, the nurses... everyone there including people at the register are really nice.  A pleasure going there.

Listen, don't let the location fool you, this place is awesome... go, go, go... the food, the service, the food, the fooooooddd...! super yummy... super delish.  Listen, you must try it, the place is clean, feels like home.   I super recommend this place, even if you pick it up and take it home... do it, try it.  Try the Torta Nortena beef or chicken.  I love the shrimp tostadas... the hamburgers are amazing too... go, and go soon...

I tell you whay I love this place, one is delish...two, my kid has type 1 diabetes and we can actually take it there with no worries to eat, because they have choices for her.  I love the look, the location everything about it...  I think we need more locations... cause the one we go to is rather far, though we love the Biltmore, is a trip...how about a location in Glendale?

I'm going to say, YES to this place.  My husband suggested it before, but since we don't live close to it, we figure that if we are close to the area we must try it... and happy, really happy we are... the food was good, and plenty of it... I will say that if you are on a diet, you must share...  cause is alot.  didn't have any alcohol drinks because I'm on Weight Watchers and didn't research points for drinks.  Service was good, not amazing, but quick... I will say, you mush visit...either be with friends, love ones...or on your first date...

I like this Walmart, everyone is nice and the place is clean... the only problem I have is that the ghetto people are finding out about it and you know what that means, everything looks dingy and dirty after a while, somehow they have no idea what a garbage can looks like and they come in and trash the wonderful Market...I hope the Walmart people can keep up, I hate to go to the large Walmart down the street... that is totally Ghetto land... that place should have their own website with funny photos... scary.

All I'm going to say that Foor and Service and Sharon the owner was amazing... we will defenitively go back there... she ever recommended a wine that has become my ultimate favorite... Aphothic Red is the best.    I can't remember what we ordered but it does not matter cause it was DELISH!  if you are in the area...just stop and eat...you will not regret it..  See you soon Sharon.

LOVE IT..EVERY MINUTE OF IT.  Amber is amazing at what she does, I came in expecting nothing, allowing myself to just move by the moment.  I first walk in to a very quaint beautiful little place, literally feels like you are in La Joya, Ca. very exclusive, very clean, beautifully decorated.  Then you meet sweet Amber, which by the way is stunning, but extremely grounded and humble nature about her.  Next, we proceed to the facial room which had great music playing, peaceful and serene.  All products are natural, she message my arms and feet, which are really clean....LOL. 75 minutes of pure luxury.    Thank you Amber for the wonderful experience.  You have a new customer in me, and I will definitively tell all my friends about your service.  I say to the rest of you... go the one facial I got, is only $65---super worth it.  I got mine from Groupon...but I'm going back cause $65 is nothing for what you get... my skin is glowing!!!!  www.sageorganicsaz.com

All I'm going to say is why didn't I think of this... is not like going to AH-SO or RAW, but for fast sushi it works.  Food was good, serving size plenty.  What I would change, is parking, and maybe having some of the people working there, working a little harder to keep the place looking clean.  Also the staff needs to act like they like working, , be more grateful they have a job. and parking, did I say that already??? OH heck, so hard to find parking, forget lunch time unless you have 2 hours to spend.

This restaurant is fast becoming our neighborhood restaurant... let me tell you why.  First, you feel at home, always a smile, super super clean, the service is fast but the food is delish and hot.  The Blue margarita... is must have!!!! after one, you can't drink and drive... hahaha, sooooooooo good.  Bottom line is, we love it... we go once a week, the price is so good, we can actually afford to go once or twice a week.  I hope it stays the way it is... plus my hubby loves when the waiter call him "my friend" LOL.  Re-review  After over a year of loving this place, they change staff and the new people are horrible, the food change, sad but I would never go back.

I'm giving it a 5 star only because the food is amazing.  Finally I'm able to enjoy asian, vietnamese food and tell everyone.  I love the flavor of the Pho soup, the fried rice was to die for.  We are defenitively coming back.  I would though get the server to move and be more alert, if you are in any rush then you will be late, if you are just there to chill with family and friends then is a great overall place to eat.  Clean, nicely decorate, sweet staff.

I really wanted to like this cute place.. I will add, the service was nice.  I found this restaurant through Amazon local, it looked good and had pretty good review overall, but while there, I realized that it was extremely over priced for the food they served... I got the enchilada dish, and it was extremely spicy, to the point that my eyes watered (share dinner with kid) because the dish was $24, she was not able to eat it, and oly eat the corn bread hushpuppies, which taste good, my husbad order a $25 dish.  Mind you we had to order like this because it was the deal I bought,  rediculous... I know they have to make money but come on... first impression are huge...   We also ordered an appetizer (some fish tasteless dish) and a couple a drinks and the bill came to $75.00 plus add tip.  To say the least, I will never go back, I expect a lot of flavor for that price.  I went to Anaya's in my neighborhood and I ordered almost the same with the difference that I got extra margarita and the price was $33.00 plus tip, and it was to die for!    If you have money to waste and like a bit of a snobby attitude while you enjoy dinner, then this is it, I think they should move location, get a new cook, chill a bit...lower the prices a bit..and they may have a chance.  Good luck.
