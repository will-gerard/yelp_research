OK, this is my first review. I went to La Piazza last night with family and was VERY disappointed. We shared the rigatoni al Forno. The sun dried tomatoes were tough and tart, maybe three artichoke hearts and a few pieces of under seasoned but tender chicken. The sauce was a mixture of pasta water and olive oil with little more. Now for the pizza. Since when does artisan style pizza have to be burnt? I've eaten at several "in" pizza places and the pie is nearly inedible. This was the case here as well. I liken the crust pita bread. We ordered the Verde, with lots of veggies but we added sausage. If the sausage had not been on the pizza I'm not sure it would have had eaten more than a few bites. The pizza was topped with fresh arugula, which I usually enjoy, but this time they unfortunately did not wash the greens. They were a bit sandy. Finally we ordered Zeppoli's. I was so hoping that the crispy, lightly sweet dessert would brighten our meal. It did not. Can you say golf ball? We sent them back asked for the check and promptly left. I will not go back.

Well, I've been meaning to yelp this place for a while now. I stopped by today for breakfast and decided that today was the day.   Although I don't really like the plates and cups and silly sayings on the walls and counters and everywhere else they could fit it I love the food and staff. Everyone where some teams jersey, I'm not a fan but whatever. I'm there for the food and friendly service. It's true that they are almost always busy, requiring a wait. I don't care. It's usually not long and it's worth it.  My fav on the extensive menu is Adam's Eggs. An extra large biscuit, poached eggs, ham and cream gravy. Oh yes, and a huge portion of home fries. Delicious!!! The plate sized pancakes are great and Farmer John Breakfast or something like that is a meal for 3 people. That is not an exaggeration.   All things considered they have my vote for best breakfast. Maybe I should make the trek down to Matt's but their wait is just not attractive to me. I hear the food is awesome, but in neighborhood Ronnies is king.

Subdued, comfortable dining room, arrogant servers and mediocre pasta. Yep. I said it! Started the meal with stale bread a 20 min wait for beverages. The olive oil was tasty but I'm assuming the guys in the back had nothing to do with that. Mind you it was 5pm on a Wednesday. When our server did bring drinks I mentioned this was our first time and we looked forward to some authentic pasta. He stared into my eyes, awkwardly, and said, "Yep, were kind of the real deal". I knew then we were in for it. The pizza was fine but the pappardelle with bolognese was umm.. Not amazing. It wasn't the pasta itself rather the sauce that turned me off. Bland, slightly tomatoey and vaguely creamy with a smattering of coarsely ground meat. Just not what I know Bolognese to be. In my world it's deep red and heavy on pancetta, ground veal or pork and beef with just enough tomato to make everything come together. They missed the target. Sorry guys. If you want a decent pizza give it a shot or just find a Grimaldi's, La Bocca or Isa's. Have I been harsh? Maybe, but I'm tired of these trendy spots telling me what the "Real Deal" is. Thanks but no thanks. Next time I want good pasta I'm staying home.

It was our anniversary and we decided to get some pho. Opened up my trusty Yelp app and searched. I quickly found Pho AV. Read some reviews and decided to go for it. We knew what we were getting into. Little ambiance, no house music. Our table was a little sticky too. All this and we were still on board. We ordered the shrimp Pho and the chicken version. Also added 4 spring rolls. 2 too many. They were good. Not great. The shrimp were properly cooked. There were a few more noodles in it for my taste but the, what I think was pork was not good. Grey, fatty and largely cut. Making it a tough chew. I have to say we were the only ones in the place. The owners were very nice but after ordering they disappeared and I heard the microwave. I cringed a little. So back to the spring rolls. I didn't hate them. The peanut sauce was fine. Done. Now the Pho. We're served the traditional garnishes on a speared plate and an ample bowl of broth and noodles laced with lightly charred onions. The broth was clear and seasoned but not overly. The flavors were subtle and clean. The chicken was white meat and shredded. It tasted a bit of the fridge. I'm nitpicking. It was good. The prices are very affordable and I'd like to try some other dishes. It smelled of curry when we walked in and I'm eager to try it when I return.
