A little background information: we went on Sunday 4/17/16 @ approximately 4:30-5pm. The place wasn't that busy, so we thought for sure we'd get excellent service and great food in stellar time.   We sat down and the waiter seemed uninterested in taking our order and being at work all together. We didn't order anything extravagant or needy, just standard menu items (nothing customized at all), the waiter cut us off as we were ordering, and acted put-off in general. The waiter then brought us our drinks, a basket of biscuits&frybread and slapped them down without saying a word and walked away.   When our food arrived 45 minutes later, the steaks were way over cooked (example I ordered mine to be "medium" and it was definitely closer to well done), and NOBODY's food was hot (and NOTHING tasted good enough to justify the price I paid). The food was on the lukewarm side, but on the cool end of that spectrum. If the service couldn't get any more subpar (at least from our waiter), we had to get out of the booth to track down different servers to ask for things like butter (simple things). To top it off, the only time the waiter ever even offered to top our drinks off was when we asked for the check.   Needless to say, I'll never be back. I will however share my experience with my friends, coworkers, and anyone else who mentions this place. It was pretty disappointing to say the least. I hope the manager or owner will read this review and make some changes. This place definitely had the potential to be a neat experience... It fell way way short. You'll get a better meal & service at just about anywhere else.i

I only stopped here because I was on fumes. To start things off, they don't accept any form of credit card transactions... Which I suppose I could live with, but then when I went to use my DEBIT card, they charged me a $0.35 transaction fee. Are you kidding me? Because of this I bought $5 worth of fuel and took my business elsewhere. To summarize: Place is a dump, customer service is terrible and the transaction fee to use my money to buy fuel? Ridiculous. I will not ever be spending my money here again. I hope they go out of business. This place almost never has anyone in the parking lot anyway...

Stop whatever you're doing and read this review right now! This place is fantastic! I'm not going to lie, I was a little skeptical at first, but I very quickly changed my tune!   We started with an appetizer that everyone on Yelp seemed to talk about, the lobster Mac and cheese... It was really really good! For our main courses we ordered the "tide roast" and the "spicy seafood pasta". Both were nothing short of wonderful! (Side note: when I ordered the spicy pasta, our fantastic waitress asked if I'd like to taste the base sauce so they could either spice it up or take it down a notch. Very much appreciated by the way)  For dessert we got the bread pudding (also raved about on Yelp). Definitely lived up to the hype!  Also, portions were huge, so we definitely took home some leftovers of everything.  I will DEFINITELY be back. High Tide Seafood Bar & Grill is just where you want to go! I'll also be sharing with all of my friends how good the food is and how awesome the service is!
