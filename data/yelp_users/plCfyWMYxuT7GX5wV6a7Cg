The owners make the salon less than stellar. Very unhappy with them.

Seriously the greatest little secret in Phoenix! I found this shop because I lived about 4 blocks from them - about 10 years ago. I kept taking my car there because all the guys working there were super nice...and super cute! And of course I could walk home while they worked on it.  Now it's 10 years later, I have moved away from Phoenix, and I still get to go there! Same cute guys, same fabulous service! I just can't walk home while my car is there. And they even remember my car and me. And a few years ago they have built out the shop to be pretty swanky and able to handle much more service. Nice to see their success and growth!  I promise you that you can safely take your car there for the most professional service. I would gander that it is probably better than a dealership - they are professionals and know how to run a great business. It's almost like they went to the "Ivy League Car University". You'll know what I mean when you go there - seriously fabulous. I have never paid too much and would leave them with my car and a blank check.  Although now that I have posted this, they may no longer be a little secret. ;)

This is the dental spa! You'll feel like you're at the resort of teeth care when you visit Dr. Coombs. First you'll be greeted by Nancy, who is very personable, and she'll remember you...your conversations of past, your personality, your dental quirks...she'll ease you into your dental experience just by talking to you and comforting you. And she has great teeth, as does everybody else in there.  I have never had a bad hygenist either - they are always very concerned about your health - they'll tell you to floss, they'll even show you how to floss. And they'll tell you everything else you need to know about your teeth and why you need to take care of them.  Dr. Coombs will do your other procedures...your fillings, your braces, etc. I think he likes to think of himself as the smile artist - your teeth are his canvas, and he will make them beautiful. You'll work together on taking the glam all the way, or keeping some of your charming toothy quirks. It's all good, regardless of  how you go, as long as it's not anything that will cause problems in the future.  And you never have to worry about being oversold anything...they really just care about your dental health and making you look great - but only if you want to. I can't say enough good things about Dr. Coombs and his staff...and his beautiful office!  I actually fell asleep during my last filling...if that means anything to you. :)

Wow - so grateful to these folks! My engine light came on about 2 blocks from their shop. I stopped into an type of auto place when it first came on to get a garage recommendation and they said DB's did some of their work and that they were a terrific garage. So I drove up and they were awesome! They got me out in less than 90 minutes, needing spark plugs and second cylinder on my 4-Runner fixed. They said it was close to closing time, but they'd give it a try. They got it done, and the price was fair and they were super nice. Great great place! They even sent me behind the garage to the historical train tracks museum for a walk. Not to mention, they liked my dogs. Sending them lots of happy thoughts and gratitude for saving me a day on my trip!! Woo hoo!

The patio is nice if you like sitting in a parking lot right next to a busy freeway on one side and a busy road on the other side.  The food was just like all the other food you can get in Scottsdale - nothing original. I ended up ordering bread and a salad because being vegan, there was nothing on the menu I could eat.  That being said, I asked about the tomato soup they were serving that day. The waitress asked about the stock - and yes, it did have chicken stock in it. So I explained I can't have it because it has meat in it. Then I ordered the mixed greens. She asked me if I wanted the full salad or the little wedge. Well, the menu said they had a small version of mixed greens, so that I what I thought they meant...small mixed greens salad. Apparently what I ordered was a slab of iceberg lettuce with blue cheese and bacon bits on it.  So for $4.50 I got to eat some plain iceberg lettuce - apparently the waitress didn't register that not eating meat stock in the soup didn't translate to bacon on the salad...and apparently my small mixed greens meant iceberg lettuce.  I let her know later that she should have thought about the meat thing - she apologized and then charged me the $4.50 for the slab of iceberg lettuce. Great.

Beautiful studio in the heart of uptown Phoenix. The staff is super friendly and so dedicated to this venue. You'll love the beautiful changing rooms, the gorgeous studios and the talented staff. Try and get a class with Danielle if you can! I've also heard great things about the Kundalini...I need to try!

Sherene does massage and eyelash extensions. If you've never seen yourself as a Disney eye-fluttering herione, this is your chance. Sherene will take the time to make your eyes creatively sassy! Or naturally beautiful, whatever your mood is.  Eyelashes are a commitment - you'll spend a lot of time and money, but I promise you, you'll get more attention then you've ever had in the past - I've been approached about my lashes from the postman to the girls at the Starbucks to the beautiful Scottsdale waitresses.  Sherene will help you plan for this new adventure in eyewear - she'll help you plan your look, your fills to keep them plush, and your budget. She would rather you be gorgeous and feeling great than missing out on such a fab service!  I haven't done a massage with Sherene yet, but I can only imagine on how nurturing and caring she is with my lashes, that she would make sure every troublesome spot got feeling good again. She's a master at details and feeling/looking great.  ~ from an eyelash extension lifer

Sherene never fails to amaze me. You'll feel like a pampered princess when you walk into the Diva Den. The room sparkles with pin-up girls, pink sparkles and candles. Sherene always makes sure I'm warm - extra blankets and cozy pillows. She always has the best girl music playing. And she is always sensitive to my needs - whether it be good conversation, peaceful rest, or uplifting life stories. And if you really want to get in good with her, bring her some homemade vegan treats.  Seriously - lashes and massages - you will LOVE her! I have been going to her since she started her lashing journey...and she is the sweetest person I have ever met in the beauty industry. I wish her the best clients that love her as much as I do! :)

If you're looking for an authentic yoga practice, this is your sanga - your yoga family. Every class Dave or Cheryl teach is mixed with Sanskrit, chant and yoga philosophy. It's never just about the poses. They will strike your interest in a complete yoga practice - practicing all eight limbs of yoga. I have learned so much from them - after only 2 years of yoga I am now learning the Sanskrit language, teaching yoga, chanting in Sanskrit and my practice is amazing. All thanks to them for opening the doors to what an authentic yoga practice should be.

I have known Mark for quite a few years and I can promise he is a wonderful person to do business with! He's all about the relationships, which is why I think we are still working together - we always stay in touch. I have never had any other insurance other than State Farm, and they have always come through for me - even in a situation where one of my employees had accidentally transferred a policy to a new home instead of adding it, since I had both houses - still covered! They have always been there for me. Give Mark a call - great guy!

I practice yoga and went to see Dr Carlos for a bad case of sciatica. He has been treating me with acupuncture and I have had amazing results. I didn't know where else to go for something like this - no way would I ever consider surgery, medication or injections.  Dr. C is amazing when it comes to treating things - from feeling run down, stressed, or any pains...he seems to have a special gift for figuring out most health issues.  I highly recommend him for health, treatments of many various symptoms and creating a healthier life for yourself using natural remedies.

Just Breathe is a beautiful facility. The staff is amazing - though they try to keep everything mainstream, I am still able to request energy work and Zazen meditation.  Dedicated to health, wellness...and the environment, the owner is knowlegable and proud to be a part of the revitalization of the downtown neighborhood. And you can give his dog a treat.  The yoga classes are top of the line and aren't so full that you feel like just another number. I've gotten some one-on-one training in early morning classes which has helped me build my yoga foundation. They also offer Pilates, Spinning and massage. I personally go to Phil for my massages - he's very savvy with the Eastern healings and teaches the Sunday meditation class.  I'm on a great payment plan - I get a free massage every month and unlimited classes. I don't know of any other studio that can match that price structure that offers the quality of services.  The studio is beauiful, the instructors are top of the line. I go to at least 3 classes a week and wish I had time for more. If you join, I do recommended trying everything at least once. They have some nice variety.  xoxo, M.
