The food really is some of the best soul food I've ever had. I tried some of everyone's sides and each was legit. I had the special, spicy ribs with green beans and rice, and I licked my plate clean

Left on hold for fifteen minutes and then hung up on only to find out they didn't have a delivery driver available. Do not waste your time with this place

Good good at good prices, the poutine is top notch, I think my only issue is the lack of seasoning on some dishes but it's delicious and you will wait in line
