After my competition Saturday 3/10/12 My team and I went to our place to have lunch usually after our pre judging show over at Mesa Art Center for bodybuilding competitions. Order my 7oz sirloin and sweet potatoes. My sweet potatoes wasn't satisfying as other times I've been here but this time it was pretty soggy/watery ehhh but I still ate it because I was craving for yummy food instead of my dieting food haha. My sirloin came out really delicious I was pretty happy and enjoyed it! Overall my meal was pretty tasty and delicious but wish my sweet potatoes wasn't all soggy/watery. Great place!

It was happy hour and I order my favorite boneless honey bbq wings. It was alright that night for some reason...wasn't as satisfying tonight. Also I am a fish and chips fan so thought I would order some of that!  My goodness! To much batter! barley tasted any fish! and the fries...soggy...enough said. But my ice tea was yummy!

Don't get me wrong, I love ihop. At this location the servers needs to not forget about us and not be rude! We waited 1 hour for our order and when it finally arrived, it was wrong. While waiting, I have also noticed there is syrup all over the holder where the syrups sit. I recommend that needs to be clean every time they clean the tables...not sure how long that's been there.

Pretty good place! But the only thing that bothered me was the pepperoni pizza...had a little bit to much cheese on it! I also had 20 wings on the side! Wings was pretty good but didn't have that much hot sauce on it! But thats okay...I'll let it pass. But overall pretty good place I'll say!

First time I been here, got a hair in my sushi. Second time I been here, I pulled hair out of my mouth. They didn't do anything about it but replaced it with a new roll.

Had to many problems with this hotel. My room key I had to bring to the front every day cause it stop unlocking my room so they had to reactivate it again. Poor customer service. Had to many issues for 4 days here. Last time I'll be staying here.

My favorite Chinese place around here! Great food but not so great service. The place looks clean in the inside but the outside looks deceiving.

Honestly...the burger I had wasn't that great...I experienced better. I went there for lunch and there was like a young kid was taking my order...poor customer service...and my burger came on OK. Wasn't that great and kinda pricey.

Went to Xhale last night. It was alright pretty nice place to chill and relax. Xhale is a place to keep coming back for hookah! Usually stop by once a week just to relax and have a good time with the buddies.

Yes it's a good deal when trying to join a gym. This review I would give a 1 star but I gave it a 2 because they got free wifi. This month I just recently joined. But the atmosphere here is not very great. Too many people here that walks around, chest out and thinking they run this gym. Most of the time we have people just talking and talking and recording or taking pics of themselves or others. And finally, every time I get a drink of water, I usually leave my bag or keys in front or on the machine and coming back seeing my stuff has been moved and someone is using my machine. Sadly to say, all this was young folks. Honestly, I have been thinking on cancelling my membership this month.

First time checking this new LA Fitness out was Sunday, I did legs and it was about 6PM and there was decent amount of people there! The place look great! Great cardio machines witch has TV's and ipod chargers so that was great! And then I went back today and wow! parking lot was full! and I wasn't happy near the dumbbell area...dumbbells where everywhere!!! There was more dumbbells missing on the rack then there was on the floor! Wonder where they went...also the people there just chat chat chat! no working out! just standing there in front of the machines and such and just chat away! but overall its a nice place but ehhh just the atmosphere.

The week of grand opening I finally came here to eat during lunch. Finally we have a Smashburger near my work! Food here is great! But today, instead of fries, I got the fried pickles...not a huge fan. If you like pickles, you might like it!

I'm a big time vaper! Vape Shope AZ is the best shop I've been to hands down! They have two locations, south of 19th and camelback and this location! They obviously know what they are talking about! They have a great atmosphere and great workers! Also to mention, both locations have a very clean and nice set up at their store!!!

I'm glad they have a Hawaiian barbecue place down the street from where I live. Before I used to drive to Leo's on bell road but so far in my opinion, these two places are quite almost similar. But unfortunately, when I was in the drive-through they made me come inside to get the curry chicken.
