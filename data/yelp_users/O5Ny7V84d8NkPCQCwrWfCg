To all my size 11 sisters out there......this is a site for sore eyes in the shoe world!    I stumbled across this place as I was on my way to Nordstrom Rack to rummage through the stacks of size 11 mark downs.  Low and behold right next store I noticed the Designer Shoe outlet.  Now, if you have big footsies like myself, you know that we normally don't go to these places because they never have cute shoes for us.  However, when I walked by, my inner shoe vibe told me that this was worth a peek.    Not only do they have size 11..........but they have graciously taken all of the size 11's and put them in a special area for us so that we don't have to search endlessly for them! How awesome is that?   I'm not talking about the lone rack shoved in the back by the delivery entrance...oh no....I'm talking 5 or six big racks of shoes.    I walked out of there with 2 very cute pairs of shoes and only spending around $100 bucks! How great is that?  I had to restrain myself, and said farewell to some very cute pumps that were a nice to have vs. a need to have.  I'll be visiting this place again for sure!

Finally went to eat here after hearing about it over and over and over again from co-workers.  My husband and I went around 6pm on a Sat. and we waited approx. 30 minutes for a table.  This was one of the more pleasant waits at a restaurant that I have ever experienced.    With plenty of seating around the bar, we were immediately approached by a friendly waitress who had our drinks back to us lickety-split.   I had the house Chianti, and the hubby had a Fat-Tire.    We got a nice booth inside and had another friendly waiter who brought us samples of the house Sangria which I also ordered.  It was pretty tasty, not out of this world, but it was cold and refreshing.  We got the boom dip which was excellent and the Chicago style pizza.  The 10 inch is way more than enough for two people. Two things about this pizza, 1) The crust is buttery, crisp and delicious.  2)  The sauce had a little too much basil for my taste, but they are very generous with the cheese and other toppings.  We walked out of there with lots of left-overs.    We did try the cookie dessert and it was tasty, but again, not out of this world.  I think a little less ice cream, and a little more cookie would be better.    Overall, I would go back here, and maybe see this as a good place to take out of town guests (with the exception of the long waits).  The atmosphere is nice, great friendly staff, and good food.

Was a little skeptical walking in because there was no one in there, but what a find it turned out to be! Now, this is not a cheap place to eat, but I've rarely found a good French restaurant that's easy on the wallet.  This was a really good meal, and I never knew this place existed even though we live 5 miles away. We had the escargot, cream of asparagus soup, filet, and bouillabaisse. Get the Decoy Cabernet, to go with your filet, and then I highly recommend the bananas foster for dessert. Yum! Great service too.

We started our hike from the Central/7th Ave. entrance.  This is quite a hike initially.  You will be out of breath if you're not a cardio master.  I've been working out 5 days a week for the past 6 months and I was huffing and puffing a bit.  I felt like a chump because I was having a rough time at first, but after the initial hill, it's not bad.    The views of Phoenix are beautiful, but like Dan E.'s review said......"Don't let the beautiful desert deceive you" it is toasty up there even on a beautiful 85 degree day like yesterday.  Always bring water!

Thanks to Kristin C. and John S. for posting about Costco Home! I never knew such a place existed.  And I agree that we are lucky to have one of these here.    We bought two very nice desks for our home office today and I was pleasantly surprised at the selection and quality.  Both items were in stock so that made it even better.    Also, my number one most absolute favorite thing about this place.....NO SHARKS!!! hahaha...  For those of you who have been furniture shopping lately, you know what I'm talkin' about.    For those of you who don't, a shark is a furniture sales person who is somewhat similar in demeanor to a used car salesman.  No offense to our hardworking Americans who sell furniture for a living...but it's a little creepy when you jump out from behind that armoir out of nowhere and ask me for the tenth time "Anything I can help you with?"

The first time we ate here we ordered the Barbecue Rob burger cooked medium and the triple mini burgers also cooked medium.  The Barbecue Rob burger came back way under cooked to the point where the bun and plate were bloody.  The triple minis however, were cooked to perfection and in my opinion were damn tasty.    The second time we ate there, the hubby ordered the same burger, but this time ordered it well done out of fear of another bloody burger.   Well, they sure did get it well done. It was too well-done and dry. So much for that.  I ordered the pear-chicken salad which was actually very refreshing and tasty.  The pears were a little too crispy and unsweetened, but the goat cheese was creamy and tangy, and the dressing is delicious.  There are 2 things that I would highly recommend here, the sweet potato fries, and the pistachio gelato. I've had some very good gelato in my day even from the streets of Italy.  This was almost just as good.    Overall, I think this is a good place for being way out here where there aren't too many casual places to eat.  If anything, the fries, triple mini burgers, and gelato, are worth a visit!

If you're looking for fast, friendly service with scrumptious Sonoran Mexican cuisine...this is a spicy jewel in N. Scottsdale.  I would go here for the chips and salsa alone!  They also have a very cozy little patio outside with a rolling creek that makes sipping the house margaritas even more enjoyable.    Wondering what's yummy to eat here?  I'd say start with the mini fundidos. These beauties are mini eggrolls stuffed with cheese, chicken, and green chili goodness, drenched in a jalapeno cream cheese sauce.  Served up in a mini skillet these are a tasty way to start your dining experience.    I've sampled a few of the dishes here, and if you are a fan of green chile, you will be very pleasantly surprised to see a variety of their dishes are made with Hatch green chile.  Growing up in New Mexico, I was very happy to see this on the menu!  When the menu says "spicy" they mean it!  Try the enchiladas, quesadillas, and the green corn tamales.

The hubby and I were trying to decide on lunch. I felt the need to support one of our local eateries that we hadn't tried yet.  Just off of Pinnacle Peak Pkwy and Miller is 3 Tomatoes & a Mozzarella.  We started off with sharing the Tortellini Insalata which was infused with a fragrant basil vinagrette.  This was a light and refreshing starter salad that was a perfect portion for 2.  We are pizza junkies and very picky pizza junkies at that.  So we decided to try the Quattro Formaggi pizza.  This was a fantastic pizza.  It had parmesan, fontina, gorgonzola, asiago cheese, prosciutto, roasted garlic, white truffle oil infusion.  The garlic was soft, and sweet and added the perfect accent to the prosciutto and cheeses.    After devouring more than 1/2 of the pizza, we realized that our promise to one another of "Honey let's really try and eat healthy and not go overboard" was a distant memory,  we thought what better way to end the meal than with the homemade chocolate chocolate chip gelato.  It was a fantastic. We shared a bowl of this yummy goodness and there was a small spoon fight at the table.  My advice, order your own ;o)

Not sure about the other Bamboo Clubs in the Phoenix area, but this one.....uh.......I wouldn't go there again if you paid me.   Yes that sounds very harsh.  I will say that it was not the wait staff that is causing me to give such a poor review, our waiter was friendly, and prompt.  The food however......leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the lunch special which consists of a soup, an appetizer, and a main course all for $9.95. Not bad huh? Yeah well I think there is a reason for the 'steal of a deal' pricing.  So let me break it down for ya.....  - Iced tea tasted like steamed cardboard.  I think it was supposed to be green tea...but not 100% sure.  - Wonton soup, not too bad, but the pork tasted rubbery.  - Fried rice almost made me vomit. Seriously folks.  Without going into Drama Queen mode...let me just say EEEEW.  I could have sworn they cooked band-aids with the rice because that's how it tasted.  - The crab wontons...too crabby and peppery.   - The mandarin orange chicken, eh..so-so. That was about the only thing I picked at on my plate. I'm hoping that it was really chicken and not some other animal because it did look a little strange for chicken.  We did get seated quickly and got our food in a flash. Our waiter was very courteous and the environment is pretty cool. It's just a shame that the food was so incredibly bad.

I have been going to Icon since I moved here last year but failed to be a good Yelper and add it to my reviews! I know...it's a yelp crime!  Living in snowbird central, I was worried about a salon in this area in fear that I would come out looking like one of the Golden Girls. I never thought I would find another stylist like my hockey playing hairdresser in Dallas (yes...weird).  But, low and behold the hair gods were smiling down on me and led me to this fine establishment.  The staff here are accommodating, friendly, and knowledgeable in their products.  The salon carries Bumble & Bumble (a fave of mine!) and Aveda products.    Erica is my stylist and she is wonderful.  Quick, precise, and very friendly.  I did have to go to Omar over Christmas because I waited until the last minute to get an appointment with Erica, and I have to admit I was scared.  It's almost a crime to cheat on your hairstylist, but she understood.  Omar was very nice and did a great job on my hair as well.  They keep a little card on your styles, hair colors, treatments, preferences and all that good stuff so that when you come in there is no mystery as to what has been done to your hair.  It's like a hair diary just for you!  This is a great little salon with talented and courteous staff.  Next time you're out of the city and in the middle of nowhere, check it out!

I stopped here for fuel and a car wash on my way from the gym to work the other day.  My car was in desperate need of a bath, and I didn't have time to visit my favorite Cobblestone car wash in Scottsdale.    Because I did not want to continue to drive in shame, I figured a nice little rinse at the quick car wash would at least help a little.  My car is black and was so dirty it was starting to look like it had a nice gray primer coat on it.  When the soapy cycle of the wash began, I noticed something flying above my car.  To my surprise, I looked up and notice several pigeons riding back and forth on the car wash "arm".  To their credit, the pigeons looked quite happy going back and forth...back and forth.  I think one of them smiled at me.   (A side note...where there are birds ready to poop, they will find me somehow.  I must have a poop magnet somewhere around me because it ALWAYS happens.)  I am already stuck in neutral and it's still in the soap phase of my wash.  So I sit and wait.  I count how long it takes before one of the birds craps on my freshly rinsed car.  Of course, within moments of the dryer beginning and the green light flashes, I notice a nice little white pile on the hood of the car.  To make things even more enjoyable, the dryer smears the freshly deposited prize across my hood.  After all, who wants wet pigeon poop on their car?  Moral of the story peeps...if you want pigeon poop and a car wash, this is THE place to be!  I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't ask for my money back.  However, I did make a courtesy call later to kindly remind the owners of the gas station that they have some squeaky clean pigeons living in their car wash.  They didn't seem thrilled with my sarcasm.

I feel it is my duty living out here in the middle of nowhere to review local businesses to:   A) Convince my friends that there is life and non-touristy stuff in far northeast Scottsdale...    and B) Have a good excuse to eat at new places and use the excuse of "I'm doing research for Yelp".  My latest venture was The Spoon Cafe which is nestled in to a small shopping area off of Pinnacle Peak Rd. and Pima.  I stumbled across this place while making a quick Starbucks run a few doors down.  We came in around brunch time...and it was a beautiful day out. They had all of the doors open and the cozy patio was a perfect place to sit. So here's the skinny on the place:  Ambiance:  Relaxed, great for Sat/Sun breakfast. Nice selection of music playing...a little jazz, contemporary fare.  Food:  Good breakfast fare, giant french toast, pancakes, lots of omelets to choose from and great bagels.  Hummus plate is yummy with a very generous serving.  I was a little disappointed with a salad that we ordered, which is where the 4 stars come in.  The salad had scrumptious goat cheese, toasted almonds, and strawberry vinaigrette, but then....the whole rest of the salad was iceberg lettuce. Eewww!  Come on folks...you could at least splurge for a little romaine!   Besides the lettuce situation, the staff was efficient, friendly and I would definitely go back to eat here again!

Since there are already a ton of reviews about this place I'm going to keep it short.   The coconut chicken soup is so friggin delicious, you'll want to smack the person sitting next to you.

We used to frequent this place when it was BluBurger. I am really pleased with the expanded menu and happy that they still have their yummy burgers and delicious sweet potato fries.  We enjoyed a wonderful night on their patio and I had the hummus plate and the lobster bisque.  The soup was outstanding, however, a little on the salty side to the point where I could use a diuretic this morning. ;o)  The hummus was really good and they give you a huge portion.  I'd definitely head back here to try some of their other soups and the salads that they've added to the menu. They also have a really good beer and wine selection as well.

The place is decorated nicely, the hibiscus iced tea is wonderful and the wait staff are attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, the food is overpriced, the buns are really dry, and basically it felt like a pretentious version of Blu Burger Grille.

This is one of those places where you want to shout from the rooftops how much you love it, but yet you're scared to share the awesomeness with others. I love this place, and look forward to my facials here. The staff are friendly, and damn good at what they do, and the prices are more than reasonable for the amazing service you get! Did I mention they sell awesome products like Image Skincare too?

Booked a cab online through tru cab late last night for a pickup the next morning. They called me within an hour to confirm.  The next morning, my driver John called 30 mins. ahead to confirm. He showed up on time, cab was clean and he was professional and courteous. I would definitely use Tru Cab again and ask for John.

Outstanding.  - Squash Ravioli with Goat Cheese. Dear baby Jesus I hope they add this to the menu permanently!! - Squash blossom appetizer  The place is off the charts cozy and the patio is lovely. Great wait staff and just all-around great place to enjoy a lovely meal.
