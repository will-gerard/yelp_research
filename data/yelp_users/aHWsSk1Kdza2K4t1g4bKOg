This store was absolutely amazing! I called Amber explaining that my appointment with another salon had been canceled because she didn't have enough staff to help me. Amber actually apologized for the other lady and told me to come right down. I explained my budget and showed a couple pictures and she immediately went down the right track.  I wanted a simple dress that was flowed and was natural feeling. She pulled out a bridesmaid dress that comes in white paired with a belt and it was perfect! I knew immediately, it was literally exactly what I had been picturing. I would recommend La Bella and Amber to anyone. She made the day incredible and I'll never forget it!

I absolutely love this place. I didn't have an appointment, I just wanted to see what they had. They were so nice and very helpful. My consultant was Brandi and she was so sweet and made me feel so at ease and comfortable. She really wanted to know what I liked or didn't like about every dress.  She brought in a dress that makes down to clearance and I feel in love! I have never looked so good in a dress! And to top it off, it's originally 3000 dollars but they have it to me for 95 since the next day was their 95 dollar clearance sale. They went so above and beyond and made finding my dream dress so amazingly easy and fun!

I had an absolutely horrible experience. I went to pick up my wedding dress for my final fitting and she informed my two friends and I no drinks were allowed in the house, which I get it, but she was rather rude about it and it kind of made everyone uncomfortable. After getting in my dress which was simple getting bra pads, hemmed, and a belt sewn on; I realize the belt is just hanging off the dress. After confirming what we talked about she proceeded to see the belt on with me still in it. Still fine, whatever. But then I hear oops got a little blood there. She got effing blood on my wedding dress! A small swipe and a drop in two different places. She left to get a towel to wipe it off and thankfully it came off. I understand that's a possibility but Jesus I should not have experienced it first hand still in the dress. I was so angry and upset I couldn't even enjoy how I looked. Just checked the dress the day after and the tasks she sewed the belt with have come off and it is hanging off the dress. I now have to take it somewhere to be fixed. Basically she was rude, didn't apologize for the blood incident, didn't adjust the price for the incident and her work didn't even hold a day let alone a night of dancing. I will NEVER recommend this lady I would do no stars if I could.

I didn't even get to experience this place because ten min before my appointment I called to find the location and the lady responded that she emailed me earlier, which I hadn't seen, and said she wanted to do my appointment at a different time. That she was short staffed and had to do an appointment elsewhere. She said she was sorry and we would have to reschedule. I am not a crazy bridezilla, I get things happen, but I am a person with a crazy busy schedule as is my mom. My mom and I took the day off to come here and try on dresses and she literally canceled on me as we were trying to go in. All just very unprofessional and upsetting. I guess in the end it worked out because we then went to Amber at La Bella Bridal who took me in with no appointment and was amazing and found me my dream dress. Too bad, won't be recommending this place.
