If you didn't give Red Devil 5 stars, something must be wrong! Red Devil is by far the best pizza and wings hands down! Gotta love it, i live in California now and I wish there was a spot close to my house with wings and pizza like Red Devil.   Just ate here this week since I was visiting Arizona, I came home a happy camper! :D

First timer here. Visited around noon on a Sunday. Waited a few minutes for the table. Service was great and the food was good. I ordered from their special menu, Peach Walnut Pancakes. The order came with, two eggs, bacon or sausage. I also got an order of their potatoes. Everything was great but the pancakes were really yummy. Will have to come again for breakfast or brunch.

Just moved to the area and my boyfriend and I just found this place this morning. Our new breakfast burrito spot. We just got a basic breakfast burrito with, eggs, potatoes, bacon, and cheese. Our burritos weren't greasy at all, which is a big plus. Their red salsa was spicy and addicting. Glad I found this place, for a tasty breakfast burrito on a nice weekend morning.

Decided to order a pizza and saw a pizza hut commercial so thought yea I'll give it a try since I had not had pizza hut in ages!!!!! Called in to place my order and the women who answered the phone "Gullian" or something like that, was the rudest and probably had the worst customer service that I have ever experienced! When I asked what my crust options were again she paused took a deep breath as if she was irritated with me asking for the options of the pizza I am going to pay for. She got loud and rude so I  let it slip but by the second time when I asked how many topings she raised her voice and began to yell out the answer.  That is just uncalled for and disrespectful to customers. When I called back to ask for the manager she claimed to be the manager. If this place is ran by people like this, I want no part of it! Took my money to papa johns and enjoyed their friendly upbeat service.  Thanks pizza hut for that awful experience I will probably never be trying pizza hut ever again.

Got a chicken chop chop salad, it was good but the dressing that was supposed to come with it they didn't have and I was not aware of this until my salad almost came out. That was a bummer. I love me a balsamic  vinaigrette dressing. The salad really didn't have that much chicken. I really like a salad with plenty of chicken. My mom also got a salad, BBQ chopped chicken salad. The ranch that comes with the salad is not good. I love ranch but this ranch is not good at all! My moms plate for her salad was dirty and crusty on the outside of the plate which was pretty gross. As soon as you lifted up the plate there were, brown, black spots, and old food stuck to the outside. Dirty!

Horrible, horrible service!!! Came here on  a Sunday afternoon on my birthday weekend and sat outside which was not overflowing with people in our section.  We were in a party of about 8 so gratuity was already going to be included. Well, they must of took the fact that they were already getting a good tip to give us horrible service. First of, our waiter took forever to get to us. We ordered food and drinks our waters and regular drinks took about 13 minutes to come out the beers took about 20 mins to come out. Our food  took about 45 minutes.  Our group had two orders of wings once they came out with food the wings were dead cold.  We had no water refills for the longest time. We told our waiter about the wings and he took them back. Then another server lady came by and asked us how everything was we told her we didn't have any silverware nor napkins she came by brought us the silverware she also told us she spoke to the manager and the wings would be comped.    Well, I had to ask for water with the girl since we had not seen our original waiter since our food came out. We received our bill and the wings were still included on the bill. When we asked our second waiteress she said "she thought they were gonna be comped but they are not". Well, we are not paying and we didn't wr told her and she said she would talk to the manager. She came back and told us they were taken off the bill and they were.   So was two good burgers entrees worth $50 dollars, Nope!

The environment is pretty cool. The food is good. Decided to check this place out because we were looking for a Fox restaurant to use our Fox Gift Card on. Saturday night, no wait, we were helped right away, and service was great. The bruschetta was ok but their Margherita pizza and Italian salad were delicious! Very pleased.

Best tacos in the east valley for sure! The tacos have plenty of meat and they have delicious salsas in the salsa bar. I am a taco lover and I know a good taco when I eat one. If you're in the mood for some tacos you have to come here.

Since I haven't had my dose of Gallo Blanco, I had heard that there was a sister restaurant to Gallo Blanco, Otro Cafe. My boyfriend and I decided to try it out today for brunch. I was happy with the whole place and their food! It took me back to Gallo Blanco days.  We will definitely be coming here often for some delicious food.

Not a fan, I was thinking of just going over to Pita Jungle for a salad but saw this place on my yelp. Decided to try it out. Right after I seen him making the salad I knew that I probably was not going to be a big fan. Their chicken was so salty, didn't enjoy the flavor, and the salad did not even include much of the greens, total joke for almost a $10 salad. Do yourself the favor and avoid this place and all the salt.

First time at this location. Stopped by for lunch, got their pizza and salad special. Got a slice of cheese along with the side salad. Super sucked that my cheese pizza was semi cold and not cheesy at all, like it would be at my other Barros locations. My fork for the salad that they gave me was dirty, gross!!!! To top it off I just went to the location on Ray Rd and 44th st and that one has their lunch specials cheaper then this place and that slice of pizza at the Ray rd location was heaven. Won't be stopping here again.

Delicious tacos!! Small carniceria that makes food inside such as, tacos, tortas, quesadillas and burritos. They also have some bomb guacamole salsa and another delicious red salsa.  At night they bring everything outside and have a taco stan in front of the building in the parking lot. Probably some of the best tacos in Phoenix! A hidden gem for sure.
