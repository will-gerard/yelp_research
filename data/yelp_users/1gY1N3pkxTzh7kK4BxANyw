I've been to the renowned "Memphis in May BBQ Festival," but Honey Bear's pulled pork and BBQ sauce is as good as any I've ever tasted.   Since the owners of this place come from TN, I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise. The pulled pork sandwich is out of this world. Honey Bear's motto is, "you don't need no teeth to eat our meat." And that's really true. It's slow-cooked, moist, and packed with flavor. The BBQ sauce is amazing. It's tangy and spicy, I'm thinking it might have a tomato and vinegar base, but I don't really know. My husband loves their hot links and spicy sausage. He's a rib guy too and says they're great.   Honey Bear's on Van Buren is a bit of a dive and it's located in a slightly dicey, but safe, location. I think the dumpy atmosphere adds to the down home feel of the place.

The great thing about Casey Jones is that you don't have to be a barfly or sports fanatic to have a great time.    While Casey Jones does offer the sports bar experience, it offers more than that too.   In fact, the majority people come for the great food and fun atmosphere.  Lots of appetizers are on the menu.  My favorite is the loaded potato skins.  My husband is a big chicken wing fan; he eats them until they're coming out his ears.  There are lots of burgers and hot sandwiches too.  I always order the Jalapeno Cheesesteak, thinly sliced beef, cooked with mushrooms, onions, peppers and jalapenos, and served with melted pepper jack cheese.  I'm not much of a drinker, but I know they have a full bar serving both the usual stuff and also specialty drinks.  They also have a huge variety of beer.  Prices are a great value and always several food, drink, or happy hour specials.   Casey Jones offers live music on special nights of the week.  This place is fun, not too rowdy, but a great place to hang out with friends and have a tasty meal.  (Because I want to be totally open, I need to say that I'm an acquaintance of one of the owners here, not close friends, but wanted to mention it in the spirit of transparency.)

Shortly before my mom died, she told me to entrust my skin care to Monica.  It's true.  Not that it was her dying wish or anything weird like that.  Mom gave be all sorts of pearls of wisdom, and that particular one just happened to be about skin care.  That was a decade ago and I have followed mom's advice to the letter.  And you know what?  I continue to get compliments about my "peaches and cream" almost every week.  That's pretty awesome, especially since I'm now a middle age woman.  Monica and the gals at Healthy Glow offer the most up to date skin care services such as microderm abrasion, chemical peels, light therapy, and incredibly soothing and moisturizing facials.  This place isn't one of those fancy schmancy salons.  Healthy Glow is run in a professional healthcare environment.  In fact Monica's sister Dr. Teresa Vesco shares the same office and is a successful naturopathic medicine physician.

Massage Envy   I'd give you the name of my favorite massage therapist, but then I'd have to kill you.   Back when I had a big paying job, I used to go to the Camelback Spa as often as I could. It's luxurious with awesome amenities in a gorgeous setting. Well, Massage Envy is NOT that. However, for those of us who are more money conscious, Massage Envy offers a wonderful experience.   Massage Envy is located in a strip shopping mall. When you walk in, it's a pleasant environment and friendly check-in staff. After you sign in, you wait in comfy chairs until your masseuse calls you back. Each therapist has a copy of your chart showing your preferences and past experiences. They'll also ask you if you have any problem areas that need special attention. Then they'll step out of the room while you get ready for your treatment.   Most of the masseuses will ask you about the pressure and your comfort. The massage table also has a built in heater, should you become cold. The lighting is soft and the music soothing.   All in all, this is a pretty awesome experience for $49 a month for your first massage and then $39 for any other massages you receive during that same month. They also have a family discount plan. If you need to use a different location, even out of state, your membership allows you to use the services of more than 600 Massage Envy locations nationwide.

This place is located along a grocery store strip mall. It's a little hard to find because it's tucked in on the inside corner. That doesn't seem to deter people though. This place has been busy serving customers for the past 28 years. I had no idea they'd been there that long. Geesh, they must be doing something right.   I've only tried a couple of things. By far, my favorite is their Italian sub. It's a freshly baked submarine roll absolutely stuffed with deli meats (salami and mortadella, pepperoni) and provolone cheese, then lettuce, tomato, onion, with a generous amount of Italian dressing poured over it. I know I should only order the half portion, but sometimes I just gotta go for the whole. Roll up your sleeves and get the napkins ready. You're in for a fantastic, messy, tasty treat.

Quick, easy, good looking nails - done   For a quick, but still high quality mani / pedi, this is the place to go. I usually go to my regular nail lady in a traditional salon, but she was booked, so I opted for Desert Nails, based on the good reviews.   I made an appointment, because I'm OCD and feel the need to be organized and in control. But I really didn't need one. Most people just walked in and proceeded directly to a nail station. This place has lots of nail stations and technicians. There are at least a dozen pedicure stations and they're nice with elevated comfy chairs. There are probably at least twenty manicure stations. They're a little crowded together, but that wasn't such a big deal because their manicures are fast, no muss no fuss. It's fairly quiet too because most people don't talk much since the technicians are Asian and don't speak much English. That's fine with me, it gives me a little time to relax and not have to worry about carrying on a conversation.   You should know they try to upgrade their regular services with upgrades. For example, upgrades to the normal pedicure include a sugar scrub exfoliation to legs and feet and also a callus reducing lotion. Since my feet take a beating, I was happy to pay the extra fee for a better end result.   Desert Nails is a good value and also a nice way to relax with minimal conversation, so you leave there with great looking nails without the pressure to carry on a newsy conversation with your technician.

I wish I didn't, love everything about this place, but I do.  That's why I have to show restraint and not eat here as often as I'd like; because if I did, I'd weigh a lot more than I already do.   When you walk up to be seated, you're sure to be greeted with friendly smile.  In fact, if a waiter happens to walk by with a tray full of food, he'll probably say hello too.  Even the bartender might wave to you.  Obviously, the management here places a huge emphasis on attentive service in a friendly environment.  The wait staff wears t-shirts with clever sayings on the back, such as "Legalize Marinara" and "Size Matters."  You have a choice whether to sit inside our on the patio.  If the weather is good, I opt for the patio.   It has more action and great people watching.  The menu is insane and offers too much temptation.  Anything I've ever eaten here has been great.  So I'll focus on my favorites.  My favorite appetizer is the stuffed mushrooms, filled with Italian sausage and covered with marinara sauce and cheese.  My favorite salad is the Pablo Picasso: Romaine lettuce with fajita chicken, cheese, tomatoes, onion and cilantro, then topped with tortilla strips.  The dressing is some sort of spicy jalapeno dressing.  The best pizza, in my opinion of course, is their Double Stuffed, like a deep dish pizza on steroids.  It takes 40 minutes to bake, so sit back and enjoy a couple of beers and wait for the grand entrance of your crusty cheesy tomato treasure.  Not that you'll have any more room in your tummy, but if you do, go for their Pizza Cookie.  It's a half pound of chocolate chip cookie dough, slightly baked and then topped with ice cream.    Try to visit Oregano's at "off times" so the wait will be shorter.  When it's busy, the wait time can be more than one hour.  But if it is, a server is likely to come out to the waiting area and serve you nibbles of thin crust pizza.  Is this place a slice of heaven, or what?

Good times - the Old West meets Happy Hour.   We love Roaring Fork's Happy Hour. They do happy hour for a few hours each evening, but on Sunday and Monday nights it lasts all night long.   Their huckleberry margaritas are awesome. It's a frozen margarita topped off with a luscious huckleberry puree (think purple tart blueberry?).   The bar menu is one of the best too. My favorite is the Big Ass Burger. It's a huge burger loaded with smoked bacon and cheddar cheese. It's served with a kettle of crispy fries. Another appetizer we really like is their Green Chile pork stew. It's served hot in a personalized kettle, covered with melted Jack cheese and served with warm buttered tortillas on the side.   Roaring Fork's entire menu is a blend of comfort food and Southwestern flavors. The happy hour is moderately priced, not cheap, but given the quality and quantity of the food, it's still a great value.

P.F. Chang's little sister serves up (almost) the same food, but at value prices.    Hankering for delicious pan-Asian cuisine in an informal setting? Pei Wei is owned by the same company as P.F. Chang's China Bistro. Pei Wei provides much of the same menu, but in an informal setting with value prices. Stand in line, place and pay for your order. Get your beverage, condiments, and fortune cookies at the self-serve bar. By the time you've settled into your table, your piping hot, freshly cooked plates of happiness will be delivered to your table.   My favorite is the Minced Chicken Lettuce Wraps, diced chicken, shiitake mushrooms, water chestnuts, and scallions, served with a side of cool lettuce leaves. Yes, it's an appetizer, but it makes an awesome meal too. Another top choice is their Asian Chopped Chicken Salad. It tastes fresh and crunchy with a tangy Asian flavor. While the lettuce wraps and the chopped salad are delicious, the added bonus is they're fairly low in calories. What a great way to enjoy a lot of mouth-watering flavors without blowing your diet plan.

Looking for a romantic dining experience with below average food?  Here it is.  We were excited to try this place because we'd heard about the patio seating overlooking a lake, romantic lighting, and even an outdoor fire pit.    But as we were being seated, we noticed the restaurant was almost empty.  Not a good sign.  It took a while for a server to approach our table.  When we asked to see the prix fixe menu, he seemed annoyed.   We decided against ordering from the prix fixe menu anyway, because it was solely Irish food designed to commemorate St. Patrick's Day, even though we were there a week or so after the holiday.  It took another long while to actually place our food order.   I also asked for an ice tea refill, which never came.  This is not the kind of service you'd expect for a "fine dining" experience.  As for the food, after our salad course, we were presented with a complimentary amuse bouche which was a little bit of olive oil, cheese, and a cherry tomato, served stylishly in a shot glass (see pic).  This seemed like a promising way to start our meal.  My husband had the filet and he said it was good.  I had the pork chop and it was awful.  Most of it was grizzled fat, and when I could find a pocket of lean meat, it was dry and flavorless.  I'm usually not one to complain, but the meat was so tough, I had difficulty cutting it, even with a big steak knife.  I should have returned it, but I didn't want to make a scene in such a beautiful environment.  I regret that decision.  Yes, the patio setting is lovely, but given the poor service and sub-standard food, we won't be returning

Dine outdoors in an inside sidewalk café.  Leave it to the magic of Las Vegas to make something like this even possible.  Canaletto is located among the shops and restaurants of the Venetian Resort.  In true Las Vegas style, the Venetian has turned an ordinary shopping mall into what appears to be an outdoor Italian village.  The main square, a nod to the real St. Mark's Piazza in Venice, is filled with musicians, painters, gondolas, and even a gelato stand.  There are three restaurants located along this square.  Canaletto has scored the best location to people watch and enjoy all the activities the square has to offer.  The food is, of course, Italian inspired with lots of pizza and pasta on the menu.  Pizza okay, crust was good and chewy, sausage and peppers just okay.  The pasta with mushrooms and a brandy cream sauce was pretty good, but not killer.    Most of the entrees are priced within reason, keeping in mind that these are resort prices.  After all, you are dining in Italy, I mean Vegas.  I'd give this place three stars for the food.  But it rightly deserves a fourth star for the unique and fun ambiance.

Find your thrill at Blueberry Hill  I love this place.  Part of it is because it's a great diner / pancake house that puts IHOP to shame.  The other reason is because it primarily caters to locals.  Look around, lots of blackjack dealers and cage cashiers grab a bite here after their shifts at the casino.  Blueberry Hill's menu is extensive and includes pages of breakfast, lunch, dinner, specials, and desserts.  It's overwhelming, you have to focus.  The only meal I've had here has been breakfast.  My favorite is the "Little Boy Blue."  It's two blueberry pancakes with whipped cream, two eggs, and two slices of bacon or sausage  The pancakes are made-from-scratch, old-fashioned buttermilk pancakes.  The waitresses are friendly, atmosphere informal, and the prices are a bargain.   Even if you don't win in the casino, you'll certainly be a winner at this place.

There's a little bit of an island vibe going on right here in Arizona.  This casual place makes me smile.  Yes, it's just a step above a fast food place, but the vibe is tropical and the food is tasty and prepared fresh to order.   When you walk in, you'll notice the island music playing, the ceiling fans turning and some kitschy Hawaiian posters on the wall.  The air is filled with aromas of teriyaki, Jamaican jerk, island spice rubs.  Take a look at the menu on the wall and then approach the counter to place your order.  You pay and they give you one of those big plastic numbers to place on your table so the food server can match you to your order.  While waiting (not long) you help yourself to the beverage station, sodas, water, and the specially prepared Mango Iced Tea, which is amazing.  I just can't get enough of that Mango Iced Tea.  Looking around, it seems that most customers order the rice bowls.  You choose a meat (chicken, steak, shrimp, etc.) then pick a sauce flavor (teriyaki, Jamaican Jerk, Bali Island, Honey-orange), and then your choice of rice (white, brown, noodles).   Looks really good.  I typically order one of their big entrée salads.  I alternate between their Voodoo Chicken Salad and their Aloha Chicken Salad. I can't decide which one I like better.  My husband loves their Volcano-Blackened Mahi Mahi plate.  Where else can you get perfectly spiced Mahi topped with tropical fruit salsa, rice, and a salad for under $ 10?  Yum, tasty and a great value.  It's just a simple little place, but every time I eat here, it reminds me how much I love Hawaii and hope to return someday.  Until then...Aloha.

I hated Greek food, until I tried this place.   My "health nut" girlfriend had to drag me to this place, kicking and screaming. After all, my long ago experiences with Greek food consisted of soggy grape leaves and poor little baby lambs.   On my first visit, I ordered cautiously: a grilled chicken pita with French fries lunch platter. The chicken was well seasoned and the pita bread nice and chewy. It was filled with fresh tomatoes, lettuce, red onions and served with a side of delicious tzatziki sauce (refreshing cucumber yogurt). I couldn't believe how much I liked it! A few days later, I dragged my husband in, kicking and screaming like I had done before. Surprise - he loved it too. In addition to the pitas, this time we ventured out (a little bit) and ordered some different items. The Greek fries - wonderful golden crispy fries covered with both feta and Parmesan cheese and a tangy lemon mustard sauce. And the Greek salad, a tasty blend of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, red onions, peppers, olives, topped with feta cheese and tossed with a creamy Greek dressing. Since then, we've eaten here many times and continue to explore and expand our menu choices. So far, so good.   Now it's our go-to place for healthy eating and also if we just want a fun atmosphere. There's music and often Greek dancing in the aisles and sounds of "OPA!" coming from the kitchen. Nothing better than to sit back with a pitcher of Sangria, a good meal, and enjoy the fun.

Nick's has Portobello mushroom ravioli that can be served with their house pink sauce.  It's one of the best things I've ever tasted.

Is this Chicago pizza that looks like New York? Or is this New York pizza that claims to hail from Chicago?   Don't get me wrong, the pizza is delicious. I just think it's having a bit of an identity crisis.   There's no traditional Chicago pan pizza here, just thin and thick crust. I've had the thin crust on several occasions and it's outstanding. My favorite pizza is the Super Six: homemade Italian sausage, mozzarella, pepperoni, ham, mushrooms, and mixed green and red sweet bell peppers. Spinato's serves other Italian specialties, but the pizza is the real star.   Another thing (and I realize this might sound silly) is their soft drinks. They are huge and have lots of finely crushed ice. I love that, plus, they are generous with refills.   This place is locally owned with several locations. The owners are from Chicago and use an old family recipe. The staff is incredibly friendly and considerate. Once, when they noticed I was heading back to my car to grab a sweater, they offered to turn off the ceiling fans for me.

It's not a grocery store, it's an experience. Presenting, Fry's: "The Experience." (Check out my pics, you won't believe your eyes!)   The words "grocery store" or even "marketplace" don't come close to describing this place. It's more like a Disney Grocery Land.   Before you even walk in the door, you'll see free valet parking, car wash, and covered parking. Walk inside directly into an over-the-top floral department. Looks like something out of a Donald Trump wedding. There's a tree with twinkly lights and oodles of gorgeous fresh flowers. Look to your right and you'll see the cooking school. You can sign up for a variety of classes, at reasonable prices, taught by local chefs. Keep walking and you'll be in the produce section, actually more of a world's Farmer's market. It has the usual produce, of course, but also unique items such as shitake mushrooms ($50 per pound), blood oranges, kumquats, and miniature pineapples.   But the beauty is, they also offer regular apples, oranges, mushrooms, etc., at competitive prices. It's the best of both worlds, competitive traditional foods with availability of exotic items, should you wish to indulge. That same concept extends throughout the store.   Naturally, there's a wine cellar, but can you believe they also have a large wine and cheese tasting bar? And then (drum roll please) there's the bakery. I think I could live there. A normal selection of breads, cakes, pies, and pastries are intermingled with high end and artfully presented confectionery masterpieces. There's a tortilla factory too, you can watch them being made and sample them while they're still warm.   But wait, is that a Cupcake Shoppe? Yes, can select your cake, filling, frosting, and toppings and they'll assemble you very own customized cupcake while you wait. The candy counter is mesmerizing: chocolate dipped strawberries, caramel apples, chocolate dipped marshmallows, the list is endless.   Okay, admittedly, I've spent too much time on the sweet treats, but it leaves me spellbound. The meat, dairy, deli, prepared meals, seafood, frozen foods, canned goods, and international foods are available in vast and varying supply. Gees, there's even an entire section of the store called the "Kosher Experience." Plus, the pet food aisle contains a refrigerator stocked with fresh meat / dog food, should you decide to pamper your pet.   This place is amazing and is worthy of a full day school field trip. Heck, it's worthy of an adult field trip. Even so, I want to stress that normal grocery items are sold here too and at competitive prices. It's a win-win for the customer!   As you'd expect, there's a pharmacy and a bank within the store. But would you expect a jewelry store? Yep, if you so choose, you can buy a diamond ring as you're checking out of the grocery line. That'll give you some added bling when the valet pulls up with your freshly washed car and helps you load up your groceries.

Carolina's is one of my Top Ten reasons I don't leave AZ.   I've always dreamed of living near the beach and maybe someday I will. Until then, I keep a list of things I would miss if I left AZ. Carolina's Mexican Food is always in my Top Ten.   Yes, the place is a dive and the line can be long, but the amazing authentic Mexican food and incredibly cheap prices more than makes up for it. The hard machaca beef tacos are my favorite. Anything with their machaca beef is outstanding: slow-cooked, seasoned, and shredded to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. It's available with green chile peppers, red chile peppers, or plain. It's served in a taco, a burrito, or anyway you'd like. Sour cream and guacamole are great extras.   Another important tip: Carolina's freshly made tortillas are legendary. Be sure to take a dozen home. They're homemade and served warm in a plastic bag. If you're like me, you'll only have 9 or 10 left by then time you drive home.

I drive by this place every week and it's been here forever, so it must be good, right?   But NO, it was pretty awful. Only one person was in there eating, but the server / hostess must have fallen asleep in the back room. We stood at the counter for about 5-10 minutes before having to yell into the kitchen to get someone's attention.   We both ordered the lunch special: two slices of thin crust pizza and a drink for a bargain price. When the pizza came, it was so soggy, I couldn't pick it up, so had to use a knife and fork to eat it. That's disappointing because one of my favorite ways to eat thin crust pizza is folding it down the center, you know, like a New Yorker, LOL.   Given the tough economic times, with so many restaurants closing, I don't know how this place has lasted so long.

Best fast food hamburger place in the country. I'm just saying...   Forget what you know about fast food places. In-N-Out Burger is a different breed. Yes, they still have order takers and drive thru windows, but that's where the similarities end. In-N-Out Burger distinguishes itself with high quality fresh food and outstanding service, all served in a sparkling clean environment. Rumor has it they only hire students with high grade point averages to assure competent employees. The difference shows.   The other thing is that they only serve three things: burgers, fries, and beverages. They don't do many things, but they do them well. The burger is 100% pure beef and served with real cheese, fresh juicy tomatoes, and hand-leafed lettuce. Plus, they make every burger one at a time, cooked to order. There isn't even a microwave or heat lamp in the building. The fries are cut in the store, one potato at a time. You can witness whole potatoes being cut as you stand at the order counter.   I don't understand why anyone would want to go to the McDonald's nearby. Maybe nobody has told them about this tasty treasure just down the street?

I think the "Soup Nazi" runs the counter service.   Yes, it's always good to find a good Jewish deli, especially here in Phoenix. And maybe a little big city attitude adds to the ambiance. But is it necessary to provide such rude counter service? Maybe it's cultural? Maybe this place is owned and operated by the "Soup Nazi" from Seinfield?   I tried to place a big order for my mother-in-law's birthday party. I wanted mini deli sandwiches, mixed fruit salad, chocolate covered strawberries, and mini cupcakes. The guy at the counter told me, in no uncertain terms, that I had it all wrong. You don't want mini deli sandwiches; you want whole ones, cut in half. You don't want mixed fruit salad, you want crudité, you don't want chocolate covered strawberries, they're too messy and expensive, you don't want mini cupcakes, and you want a regular sized cake. Really??? Then he quoted me a ridiculously high price. So what did I do? I politely told him that I'd think about it and quickly went to nearby Fry's (grocery store) and placed the exact order I wanted. I admit that Fry's catering food was a (smidgen) below the deli quality. But given the greatly reduced price (half?) and the customer service, I'm gonna stick with Fry's Food Stores.   Guess it's a good thing I didn't try to order soup for the party. Surely the Chompies guy would have scowled and told me, "No soup for you."

Arizona + Texas + Louisiana = Great flavors of Z'Tejas   This our overall favorite restaurant in AZ. It's out go-to place for after work happy hour and it's also where we bring out-of-town visitors. Z'Tejas is NOT Mexican food. Rather it combines the flavors of the American Southwest in a bold, fresh, imaginative way.   The frozen margaritas are the best in town. Jimmy Buffet would approve. What they lack in size, they more than make up for in strength. These babies pack a punch. Maybe that's why you have to get management's permission to have more than three?   Z is near our house and serve a variety of great food, that's why it's one of our fave places. They sent me a $10 off coupon for my bday. Me and hubby went there for happy hour, had three killer appetizers (shrimp sausage dumplings, green pork chili, and Leo Street tenderloin tacos). Hubby had a margarita (voted PHX best) and I had a diet coke (trying to diet, as if). Total bill with tax and tip was under $19. Of course, bday coupon helped, but still...no wonder this is one our favorite places for food, drink, and value.

Maybe it's just me, but I don't understand why this place is still in business.   Okay, admittedly I'm not a big fan of Indian cuisine, but I've been here twice now (once to try it for myself and another time because a girlfriend dragged me here). I just don't get it. With so many restaurants going out of business, how is this one still making a go?   I will say the servers are very friendly and attentive. But, for me, that doesn't make up for the lack of ambiance and the food. The place is located in a strip mall and the inside is just okay. Most of the tables are placed close together, so you could easily hear one another's conversation. However, since we were the only people in the restaurant, this turned out to not be a problem. The food is okay, I guess. I'm not a big fan of lamb or curry, so I can't be a good judge. I ordered the vegetarian flat bread and it was okay. I also had an ice tea, but it had a weird and slightly unpleasant flavor.   If they don't start drawing in more customers, I'm thinking, they might not be around that much longer?

Paradise Bakery - the name describes it perfectly.  Paradise Bakery opened about the same year I moved to PHX, many moons ago.  They have numerous locations in the PHX area.  Over the years, I've eaten there more than a hundred times and the food is consistently great.  It's not fancy, in fact, you stand in line with a tray (think grade school cafeteria line) and as you move along you can order freshly made to order sandwiches and salads.  They mix your salad ingredients together and toss it right in front of you.  In the short time it takes to create your salad, your sandwich will be ready.  Although they have many sandwich choices, my favorite, is their chicken walnut salad served on dark whole grain bread.  My favorite salad is the crumbly blue cheese with dried cranberries and sunflower seeds, so refreshing and tangy.    Each sandwich or salad comes with one chocolate chip cookie.  If you'd prefer different cookie flavor, just ask.  Paradise Bakery also sells dozen cookie combo packs that make a special treat for a friend, or even better, for you.

Wake me up before you go go  Because I wanna go too.  I love this place.  I love the name, I love the food, and I love the attitude.  The Name: Okay, surely the name is a double entendre.  Yes, they are famous for the hash mixtures of potatoes and eggs mixed with vegetables and corned beef (or other protein choices).   All delicious, I'm sure.  But what about the other hash?  Why don't they just come out and call it Chronic a go go?  On second thought, maybe that name wouldn't fly.  The Food: It's described as twisted farm food.  Genius.  Hash House a go go takes heartwarming comfort food and gives it a crazy twist.   Want fried chicken and waffles?  Consider the Sage Fried Chicken stacked with a Bacon Waffle, hot maple caramel reduction sauce and crowned with fried leeks.  Yummy, a bit off kilter from expected and oh so delicious.  And there's plenty more choices where that came from.  The Attitude The menu, the place, the staff are all a bit funky and quirky.  Love the sassy boldness of the place.

Five Guys versus In-N-Out Burger - the competition is on.   Five Guys is a terrific burger and fries chain that started back east and has continued to branch out over the USA. It's only recently hit AZ. Word spread quickly and Five Guys has become a phenomenal success around here. If you want to spark a lively discussion, ask someone which they prefer: Five Guys or In-N-Out. It's an East Coast versus West Coast thing, yo. LOL   Five Guys serves two sizes of burgers. The "little burger" is the size of a normal burger. Their "regular" burger is actually TWO patties. Not realizing this, on my first visit, I ordered the regular size. I couldn't finish it, so it must really be big. When you place your order, you tell them what you want on your burger. Of course they offer the usual cheese and condiments, but they offer other choices too. Almost anything you want: bacon, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, jalapenos, BBQ sauce and more.   Their fries are good too, thickly cut and well-seasoned. They serve them in a brown paper bag. I like to add a salt packet to the whole bag and shake it around before spreading the fries out on the table. I prefer my fries a bit overdone, so when ordering I ask for them to be prepared extra crispy. Really good.   I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on their brand new soda dispensing machine. I've never seen anything like it. (see pic) It's only got one actual dispenser, but you press the computer screen to select your beverage choice. Then it offers you the choice of adding special flavoring like lemon, vanilla, power boost, etc. The employee guys in the back said it's an urban legend that if you punch in a secret code of ingredients, then alcohol is dispensed. Pretty funny.

I've practiced yoga for years at At One Yoga and initially wasn't happy about their merger with LifePower. But now, after several months of going to LifePower, I think it's pretty nice.   The facility is big and clean and very well kept. If you want to use the entire facility (the weights and machines) you have to sign up for a monthly contract. However, if you just want to take the yoga classes, you can buy them packages of ten classes. The ten classes can be used over any length of time. I like that because if I'm out of town or busy, my class package doesn't expire. I do wish they offered more class packages, like in groups of 25 or 50 classes, the the way At One Yoga used to do. Because typically the more classes you buy, the bigger the discount.   The great majority of the yoga instructors from At One Yoga have come over to teach at LifePower. I've taken yoga classes in several places throughout the US and I think these yoga teachers are among the best in the country.

Are you a health nut with boat loads of cash?   If so, this place is for you, otherwise, not so much. I can't argue with the notion of healthy, unprocessed, organic food, but this place takes it too far. Consider the beverage choices, ranging in price between $3-5. Offerings include the Red Moon (pink grapefruit, yuzu, agave and soda) and Andy's Elixir (olivella juice, agave nectar and soda water). I Googled olivella juice when I got home and it's made from sea buckthorn berries? In fairness, when I asked the waitress about the bizarre beverage offerings, she told me that Pepsi products were available, but not on the menu.   The food menu encompasses a range of odd ingredients such as kale, tempeh, Anasazi beans, and tofu lettuce cups. To be "safe" I ordered the Teriyaki Brown Rice Bowl. The entree was 90% vegetables, containing minimal chicken and even less rice. It was so dry; I kept digging for even a pocket of teriyaki sauce. Even so, the dish was artfully presented.   The man behind the True Food's brand is Dr. Andy Weil. While I admire him as a physician and originator of integrative medicine, I think he should stay out of the restaurant business.

Can you solve this math problem?   If there's only one cook and it takes her 15 minutes to prepare one meal at a time, how long will it take for her to prepare four different entrees for a party of four? Answer: too damn long.   Too bad because the food was actually pretty tasty, but the service was deplorable. My husband's meal arrived first and mine didn't come for a full 15 min later. When we asked about it, the server said they only had one cook and she could only prepare one meal at a time. Good thing the place wasn't crowded. How would she have handled a packed house?

Seriously, in my opinion, there's no where else to buy a mattress.  A few years ago my husband and I bought two king size "generic Tempur Pedic -like" mattresses from Mattress Factory. We use one in our own bedroom and the other for our guest room.  This is the best most comfy mattress that I've ever had in my life.  Our house guests agree!  Equally great, the prices can't be beat - a fraction of what I expected to pay. Since then we've referred several family members and friends to this place and they've had great experiences too. Don't hesitate, you should totally check them out. Message me if you have questions, etc.
