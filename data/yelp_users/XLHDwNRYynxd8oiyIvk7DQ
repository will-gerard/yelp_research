It's a typical Apple Store, therefore five stars. 'Nuff said. Plus it doesn't require you to navigate a massive indoor mall like Chandler.

I bought a $3,000 highest end Bosch fridge from them. Had a 2 year warranty.  Then it died in 8 weeks (total death - nothing worked). So they replaced it after a few weeks.  Then the replacement died after another 1 year and 11 months  (again, total death, had a an official Bosch repair guy over, etc). Sears refused to replace, because even though it had a two year warranty - they said the 2 year warranty started at the first purchase (the one that died in 8 weeks), and not with the replacement fridge (which died in 1 year and 11 months). So by their calculation, I was four weeks late to even try to get my third replacement crappy $3,000 German fridge replaced by them in a 25 month period.  And then Veronica Chapparo, their appliance manager, was very rude. She wouldn't answer my emails at all until I finally contacted the general manager after her many ignored emails, and then she grudgingly said they'd she'd give me a third Bosch fridge at 10% off next time they had a sale on the condition II'd buy a long-term insurance policy from them next time (with heavy judgment that I hand't bought an overpriced Sears appliance policy in the first place). And when I replied - could you tell me when the next sale is - a month passed with no response until I gave up and replied again - sorry to have troubled you. And no response after  a year and counting. KEEP IN MIND - I DID NOT HAVE A REFRIGERATOR FOR MONTHS ON ENDin my home while I was trying to get someone at Veronica or anyone at Sears to talk to me.  Yelper - I will send you the complete correspondence between myself and this horrible Sears executive staff to anyone on request. My email is rkillion@me.com - email me and the correspondence is yours in full.  Please don't spend your money here. Also, the awful rude managers are:  Craig Scott, General Manager Veronica Chapparo, Appliances Manager  Tbey are the worst of the worst, and this Sears is the worst of the worst - run from this place.

I've avoided Wal-Marts in big cities for years. Life is too short. But WM seems to be trying to upgrade its image, its stores, and the quality of the fresh foods in their Supercenters. So I gave this one a try. I got three or four items from the produce center (it was actually quite impressive), and headed to the 12 items or less lane. There were maybe a dozen people in that line in front of me. Sigh. Oh well.  So I stand there - checking my iPhone email - and it slowly dawns on me that someone is yelling. So I look up and I see the cashier of this line - a grizzled old lady shaking her bony finger - is screaming for me to get out of her line because she'd turned her light off. No joke - screaming! It took me a good five or six seconds to truly realize that this was actually happening, and happening to me. So I yelled back that someone as old as her should have better manners, that her light was on when I got in line, and that she should feel free to proceed straight to hell. I dropped my produce on the floor and walked straight out the door. Never again...

The best gym in America, regardless of the location. So massive there's never a wait for any equipment. First-rate services - salon, cafe, pool, tennis, squash, yoga, weights, cardio, everything. 24 hours. It's amazing.

I'd be at this place all the time even if it weren't located inside my favorite gym. Healthy, fresh, low calorie, low fat breakfasts, lunches, smoothies, etc. Every menu item shows calorie content, fat content, protein, carbs, etc - and they keep it low. The staff - every last one of them - is unfailing upbeat and friendly.  Did I mention how tasty everything is?

All Kyoto Bowls are pretty much the same, so this review could apply to any of them. It's OK. If you're on a diet, it's pretty good because it's low-fat, low-cal, and better tasting than a salad. Some of the upcharges are just silly - brown rice wholesale is basically the same price as white rice, so why the $1 upcharge? The steamed veggies are heavy on cabbage on celery and light on the tastier more colorful veggies. And no Japanese curry??? Or Katsu???  The decor is just awful - everything is a depressing shad of teal (everything! walls, booths, chairs, etc), with 1980's faux brass finishes everywhere. Dim lighting and a lots of ugly spindly plants everywhere round out the picture; a depressing ambience overall.   If you want cheap, good, big portions of Japanese fast food, with an eating area that won't make you suicidal, hit Yoshi's (two locations in Phoenix) or Tokyo Stop in Tempe. (See my reviews)

These guys have taken care of my English Setter since he was eight weeks old, fresh off the plane from Minneapolis. They always take such good care of him, know him by name and by temperament, and have been remarkably patient with all my first dog owner anxieties.  They've got four vets on staff, all of whom are great, and Bob and the rest of the people at the front desk are wonderful as well. What's more, they're inside my closest PetSmart, which also provides training classes and grooming services. I've done it all with them - very convenient.

This is a full service Petsmart with Pet Hotel, Doggie Daycare, Grooming, Banfield Vet, and of course the pet supplies store itself. The pet supplies are pricier than they should be, and they could have a better rewards program, so that prevents the fifth star. However, I have no real complaints with this place - big, clean, friendly people, good services, etc.

Just terrible - been there a few times because they're only 3 or 4 dollars, but it was money wasted. They have a very antiquated car wash, where you have to perfectly line up your wheels with grooves so narrow they barely fit. I spent 5 minutes backing up, pulling forward, again and again trying to get my wheels aligned just right. A couple times I succeeded, a couple times I didn't. If there's staff there, they'll help guide you in, but it's still hard, and there's often not staff there. For five bucks you can get a much easier car wash at any other (modern) automated car wash.

It's hard for  sub place to distinguish itself, but Cheba pulls it off. If I'm in the mood for a sub, this is one of my very top go-to places. Some interesting combinations I've not seen elsewhere (the whole pig - five kinds of pork deli), some cool munchies (froot loops marshmallow treats), and a friendly stoner vibe that seems legit and not just a marketing gimmick.

I drove by this place dozens of times not really knowing what it was about, though I assumed it was some kind of restaurant. A steak place? Who knew, but there were always lots of cars...  So I finally gave it a try, and I've drug lots of people back many times since. It's an old school cowboy diner, more or less. HUGE breakfast plates that include all the standard American classics with some Southwestern faves as well (chrorizo, huevos rancheros, green chile breakfast burritos, etc). Every massive plate comes with a big steak knife on top to help you cut your way through all the goodness. For the portions, the fresh ingredients, and the atmosphere, it's a $7-8 breakfast which is a real deal.

I lived in Philly for seven years, and thought I'd never find a hole-in-the-wall East Coast pizzeria in Tempe, but here it is!  When it comes to pizza, I'm a sauce man, and there's is really really good (crust is great as well, but I'm less fussy about that). They've got great selections, all pretty reasonably priced unless you go nuts with additional toppings rather than opting for one of the pre-defined combos.  My real find was their non-pizza Italian entrees. Like any good East Coast pizza shop, you can also order pasta, meatballs, etc. Their lasagna is off the hook and the portion is ridiculously large. They also offer a "side" of meatballs for $2. This side is two jumbo meatballs, served in its own big container with marinara and cheese - a meal in itself! And their side salad for $2 is also really tasty. I order lasagna with two sides of meatballs and a side salad for $12 then live off of it for an entire day. (Note to Tessio's - your ravioli is so good too, but a little skimpy compared to the lasagna).  You want real pizza or pasta delivered in Tempe, this is your place.

Nothing wrong with this place, but when you can't even say you're the best Indian buffet in all of Tempe...  Been there three times. Same items on the buffet each time. That would be OK if they were great, but the ground lamb dish doesn't have flavor, the chicken curry dish is filled with chopped up fatty dark meat, and the tandoori chicken is dry cooking under the heat lamp for long periods of time.  If somebody invites you here, no problem. It's not terrible. But if you want cheap Indian buffet in Tempe, you've got at least a couple other better options. And now that I think about it, it's 10 bucks with tax and drink, so hard to even call it cheap...

I know there's not a Quiktrip on every corner like some other places, but do yourself a favor and drive a little further sometimes. They're huge, super clean, with large selections, actually some fresh food, and employees who don't appear bused in from the nearest plasma and/or meth clinic. There are usually two people behind the counter, but if there's one s/he rotates back and forth between the two check-out registers to keep the line moving as quickly as possible. Plus a great gas rewards program...  Little things in life can affect the entire trajectory of your day - so I prefer to get gas and sundries from a place that doesn't force me to fight my way through panhandlers to get inside, nor make me run to the shower the moment I get home. I'm looking at you every last Circle K and AM/PM I've ever patronized...

I order takeout from this place all the time, and still do, so why am I giving it two stars? I struggled with that one. There are only three Chinese delivery places in North Tempe, and this is definitely the best of the three (faint praise, to be sure). It's standard Chinese hole-in-the-wall fare, which isn't a bad thing. I love dumplings, and I love hot-and-sour soup, and they do both pretty well. There prices are decent and they deliver quickly. I think I probably would have coughed up that third star if their physical location wasn't so awful. One example of many - there's a rickety screen in the back of the room where the cashier nurses her baby between taking orders. If hands are being washed between feedings, I didn't notice....

It pains me to only give this place two stars, because it's locally/family-owned, and it's kitschy decor is a time capsule from the 70's (that's a good thing!)  But man, it's just not anything special, and also overpriced. I'm a dumplings and hot/sour soup guy. Get those right and I'll forgive almost anything. They get neither right. The dumpling serving is meager relative to what they charge, and the hot/sour soup has no pork or chicken - then adding it is as an extra was crazy expensive!  They also don't have what other Chinese places call a "diet menu" - essentially normal entree options that you can have steamed rather than stir-fried with sauce on the side and brown rice. Not only isn't there a specific menu option for this, they declined to prepare a basic chicken with mixed vegetables for me in this way. Just "no" - even though the restaurant was basically empty and the kitchen was slow. Plus no brown rice.  Breaks my heart - I so want to like them -

I can't add much more to all the hundred plus reviews. Suffice it to say - it has the best menu, the best venue, and the best winelist in Tempe. If this place doesn't get five stars, no restaurant in Tempe should.

This place is just so cool.  The space is amazing - an indoor/outdoor, sprawling quarter block that includes various rooms in a converted bungalow, plus lots of outdoor decks, nooks, and crannies. The crowd is varied and chill - not a frat boy in sight for miles. Heat lamps, twinkly lights, booths, tables, and benches; something for everyone.  They're often crazy busy and should have more waitstaff to keep things moving at times. Plus the menu is totally standard and unremarkable barfare served reasonably cheap. If you're interested in fast as lightning service at all times and an adventurous menu full of organic locally grown ingredients, RUN! But if you want to hang out with your friends under the stars and over a beer for hours on end in the coolest space ever, this is heaven.

Not sure what more I can add. Perfect space with a mining vibe. Perfect 80's metal soundtrack. Perfect fresh ingredients cooked on demand. How this place ended up in Phoenix - a suburb of Phoenix even - rather than the Village or Tribeca is amazing. Don't forget the apps: curried potatoes!

These guys are awesome - relentlessly polite, friendly, upbeat. My pup and I drive through each morning, and they know my drink order, and my dog's name, by heart.  This is a really busy location at certain times of day, so the car line can sometimes be long, but I always see them working as fast as they can, and they've given me a free coffee on several occasions when the wait was too long.  NOTE: There's a new Starbucks policy that you have to steam milk individually for each drink now (where relevant), you can't steam a pot in advance and pour it as needed. This makes for a fresher drink, but slows down the line. Not the fault of they guys on the front line...  Awesome Starbucks team here - love 'em.

The new Fry's in the burbs are awesome, but this old relic is pretty bad. Ugly with a with a smaller selection, plus staff who pass you in the aisles (when you're obviously looking for something) without asking if they can help. If you're in this neighborhood, head over to the nearby Safeway.

A really great, large, branch. A half dozen inside tellers, four outside drive-up tellers, a couple ATM's, one drive up, one walk-up, etc. They are unfailingly friendly and polite, always seem eager to help during each of my dozens of visits there. The ONLY reason they don't get that fifth star is because they wouldn't help me retrieve my ATM from the outside ATM.  They could have asked the Brinks folks to bring it in next time they emptied the machine, but just resisted and resisted. Caused me a huge financial hassle because I had a Wachovia account that hadn't been converted and it took me two weeks to get a new card, and I had to change lots of auto-payments.

Oh they are so so so bad. I thought Comcast was the worst ever when I lived in Philly, but this outfit puts them to shame in terms of customer service. It's such a comedy of corporate incompetence it's hard to know where to begin:  1) The names they have for their various cable tv "packages" on their website are DIFFERENT from the names used by the people on customer support. I had to spend half an hour with the person on the phone, who in term was surfing their own website looking up the packages I was seeing.  2) I switched banks, so there were two months where the autopayment I had set up with the old bank bounced because I hadn't yet set it up with new bank. My mistake to be sure, but as punishment they started making me pay with cash in a machine at the local Circle K for a full year. And once I made two payments the same day because I was $60 short the first time - and two weeks later I learned  Cox had no evidence of the second $60 cash payment. Why didn't I save my receipt they asked me? FU.  3) Their On Demand service is soooo slow to load, and has a really archaic user interface. There have also been over half a dozen times when I tried to order On Demand and the screen just went blank, or tells me there was an error and try again later.. Oh well, guess they don't want my money.  4) Their DVR service also has a really cumbersome interface. I finally got all my shows setup and programmed and then my cable modem died. The new one they gave me had none of the settings it had taken me hours and hours to setup. I just gave up rather than spend another whole day reprogramming my saved shows using their crappy, slow interface.  5) Customer servicer is not 24 hours (though tech support is). And they have different numbers for every city instead of a centralized 800 number - making it very hard to figure out which number to call.  6) They're ridiculously expensive.  Get yourself an AppleTV/Netflix/Hulu combo, get Quest to do your Internet, and kick these guys to the curb. The writing is on the wall for these cable dinosaurs - you'd think they'd have the incentive to try even just a little bit.

I love Cantonese food, dim sum, etc, but nearly impossible to find outside the four or five largest Chinatowns in North America, unless you're REALLY willing to hunt.  I discovered ACE through a New Times "Best of" list and wow, wow, wow. Mesa has this place? This place could hold its own against any San Francisco Chinatown eatery. The menu is enormous. They've got the standard American Chinese fare - Szechuan primarily - all the gloppy moo goo gai pan stuff. But skip that part of the menu and go to the pages and pages of Cantonese choices.  The chili wings are otherworldly. The chili dumpling are equally amazing. In fact, order every last dumpling on the menu. You get 6 dumpling for $1.75, and they have half a dozen kinds! The chicken eggplant is perfect. And I dare you to try to spend more than $10 even stuffing yourself like it's Thanksgiving Day. You can gut FULL - entree, drink, tax, for $5 with no problem.  Why not the fifth star? Well, the decor and location is - not great. Denny's style booths with plastic flowers and garish Chinese posters. Cooks yelling at each other (not angry, just trying to be heard over the Chinese music/tv playing), etc. On the other hand, I'm tempted to view this as a positive, not a negative. This is really what these places are like in Chinatowns - it's authentic. I'm going think on that fifth star and revisit my ratings after a few hundred more dumplings (aka, two or three more weeks)...

The only reason they don't get 1 star is because the checkout people are basically nice, if slow. But everything about this place is terrible - small, sketchy, and dirty. I had one of the checkout people suggest I leave ASAP because she'd overheard some waistoids (like the ones always hanging out in the parking lot) were going to F*** me up because I drove a nice car and they saw me drive up and park.

I had intended to give this sandwich place four stars - because it seemed excessive to give any sandwich place five stars -- but hey, on reflection what could they do better to get that extra star? Nothing - so five stars it is.  Really big inventive menu. Big thick sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) made on demand, but still fast. Fresh healthy ingredients (mostly!) with super polite service. And reasonably priced! You'll leave a buck or two richer compared to Paradise Cafe/Bakery. I don't work in an office, but understand they're great for take-out (hence the name) when you're ordering a large lunch group.  Plus they have my favorite thing in the world on the menu even though it's not a sandwich: A heaping bowl of angel hair pasta with homemade marinara plus add-ins like two small meatballs for $1.50 or grilled onions/peppers/mushrooms for 50 cents each. I'd give them 5+ stars if they added a "pasta with the works"  option which gave you all four things I just mentioned for less than a $3 total add-on. But now I'm being greedy - love this place.

I really hate this company - someday there will be competition on the grid, and awful for-profit monopolies like this dinosaur will die a quick death.  I switched banks, so there were two months where the autopayment I had set up with the old bank bounced because I hadn't yet set it up with new bank. An oversight that was my fault, to be sure, but as punishment they started making me pay with cash in a machine at the local Circle K for one full year. I appealed, and after speaking up the chain through two levels of supervisor over the course of an hour, they agreed to give me a second chance, though required a $350 deposit. FU.

Best coffee in the Valley, let alone Tempe.  They roast their own beans on site (roasting days are heaven). At any given moment they'll have a dozen different beans available, and they'll offer you advice on which you might like based on your tastes. They'll tell you about the plantation each bean comes from (they buy limited batches directly from small producers). Then they grind YOUR beans in front of you and use a manual drip filter to brew your coffee while you watch. Cool artsy/hipster/gay/collegey menagerie of folks always there. And great music plus free Internet (though it took forever to get some kinks worked out last summer...).

I've been a CVS guy for about 15 years, spanning three cities across the country. Some branches are better than others, some regions are better than others - they're no better or worse than other national chains which also have some good branches and some bad branches. I picked them because they have a great "rewards program" and because they have heavy presences in places where I travel often.  So this is a bad branch. There's a couple decent check-out kids, but in general their employees are among the worst trained I've ever seen, in terms of providing polite, timely, friendly customer service. They avoid your eyes when they see you looking for something in an aisle, lest you bother them with a question. They never EVER greet you with a smile and a "good morning" or a "did you find everything you need?" while you check out. They have inconsistent policies about whether or not coupons can be scanned from iPhone or paper copies needed (the manager basically called me a liar when I said checkout people have scanned my iPhone coupons many times in the past).  I guess if you sell very profitable liquor and meds, you make money no matter how bad your attitude is. It's not like Walgreens and Rite Aid are setting the world on fire with their customer service either....  If you don't travel a lot like I do, pick a nice local independent pharmacist...

I love my boy, but travel a lot. Scares me to leave him with strangers, but these folks are true dog lovers - the owners plus everyone they hire. They remember my guy, remember his idiosyncrasies, make sure he has his own bed/food/toys/treats, etc. He's healthy, but they also never fail to ask me if he's on medication of any kind they need to provide him, or any special care he needs.  My ONLY small criticisms:    --  I've always asked for full day play, and yet when I've called to check or drop him off, he's listed as half day play, even though I keep asking them to change this is their records. I think they finally fixed it.    --  In an ideal world, they'd have a grass area outside for the dogs to play, rather than just a gravel area for them to go to the bathroom. But no other place in Tempe has those amenities either...    --  The name - who name this place??? (It's a franchise...). I'm embarrassed to trell people where I leave my dog because of the name. Why not "Dog Days" or "Pack Mentality" or "Second Home" or etc. Preppy Pets???????  Again - these are good people that love dogs. The true test? The SECOND time I dropped him off, he almost pulled my arm off trying to get inside the door he was so excited to be back.

About six month ago I stopped by to drop of my pup for all-day play, and the female owner - who is the only person working that that isn't friendly - greeted me by telling me my dog could be kenneled but was no longer allowed in all-day play. Why? He bit another dog. When? A couple weeks ago, somebody should have told you. What happened? He's not good with other dogs. But he goes to all day play all the time and all your workers always say he "did great." No reply...  And this entire exchange all delivered with a bit of tact or apology or gentleness.  He's now gone to Doggy Daycare (all-day play) at Petsmart every weekday since then for six months without incident - they love him and says he's one of the most playful with other dogs. Avoid Preppy Pets...

Oh I love this place. When a generic Harkins theater closed on Mill, the space could have been converted into more chain restaurants and/or overpriced urbany lofts. Instead we got an independent multi-plex! Not one that shows new indy movies, but one that hosts weekly or monthly screenings of audience participation classics like Rocky Horror, The Room, and Carrie! Plus they have special events with some of the stars - I met Mink Stole and the stars of "The Room" within a single eight-week period.  This place makes me happy. :)

If you live REALLy close to this gym and/or you want to go to the gay gym downtown, this is your place. Otherwise, there are just too many negatives. It's a nightmare between 4pm and 8pm - if you must work out between those hours WALK AWAY. It's also brutally hot at least 6 months out of the year - they just refuse to ratchet up the air conditioning in the summer, plus it's packed with people - you can't breath it's so hot. Staff isn't belligerent, but neither are they friendly - mostly disinterested unless trying to sell you something. I work out at LifeTime Fitness most of the time, but if I'm hiking Piestawa Peak will work out here afterwards. Only $25/month so no big deal to keep two membership for me. Again, for the most part you want to avoid this gym if you can, even in favor of another LA Fitness elsewhere unless you fall into one of the two categories I listed at the beginning of my review.

Panchero's!!! They're franchising now??? I lived on this in Iowa City back in the early 90's when I was in law school. How cool that they (and Jimmy John's!) are now national from such humble beginnings.  Their freshly pressed, hot, toasted, chewy tortilla is their trademark (plus the mixing of the ingredients with a special spoon, but that's a bit gimmicky). Either you love their tortilla or you don't. I love it a lot! But it's not your standard tortilla out of the plastic bag, so to each his own. Other than that, it's the usual Chipotle/Qdoba-type fresh ingredients (which are awesome).  I wish you guys would bring back the grilled chorizo option from 20 (!) years ago in Iowa City  and start cutting the carne asada directly from a rotisserie again (also from back in the day). Another way to distinguish yourself from the other burrito places...  Go Hawks!

Troy is one in a million. It takes awhile to get an appt with him (unless it's an emergency); maybe a few days or even a few weeks, but it's worth the wait. I always pay him more than he asks, even with his low hourly rates, because of how much he lowballs. He's a gem.

Laundromats are usually the most depressing places on earth (though AM/PM's and Circle K's give them a run for their money). Not this place - it's brand new, clean, bright, with a friendly college student vibe. Flat screen tv's are running CNN, there's free wireless internet, free coffee, and some vending machines.  I have a washer and dryer, but travel a bunch and often want my clothes laundered. This place has a very reasonably priced drop-off service which can even be same-day if you come early enough. They also keep a record for each client, so if (for example, in my case) you need free and clear detergent and no fabric softener, they remember without you having to tell them. (True disclosure, they made a mistake twice - not very often considering how often I use them - and have been so sorry each time).  The owner is awesome, and she's got an eye for good staff as well. Whether it's her or any of the other people that staff the desk, they greet me with a smile and often remember my name. Icing on the cake: they use only eco-friendly liquids and energy conserving machines, and can send away your clothes for dry-cleaning to an eco-friendly cleaner.

I love this place, and their owner deserves a citizen of the year award in Tempe. The work and money and time he's plowed into getting this off the ground in a crappy economy is almost heroic. And he's such a nice guy! This place is three stars for what it currently is and five stars for its potential and current upward trajectory - it gets better each month.  OK - it needs even more selections (not that the current selection is bad), it needs even more fresh produce (so tricky because it's all local and organic and spoils quickly if not bought - so I'm sympathetic to their plight), and needs a prepared foods section (they'd make a ton on this I think). And the checkout folks need to be a little less hipster fabulous and a little quicker to stop eating their snacks and/or talking on their cells and just ring you the hell up.  Support this place my fellow Tempeans - it's a very cool little store and will only get much better if you support them with your dollars!

I've had generally very good experiences with both the sales team and the service team. My two-year lease expires in two months, and I plan to get another A4 from here again.  As far as car buying experiences go, and service experiences go, this is definitely much better than the norm.

This place is a real treasure in the Tempe and the West Valley. It's a family-run place it appears - I've glimpsed a grandmotherly figure in the back kitchen watching the pots.  I like Caribbean food, but it's not one of my all-time favorite cuisines. Plus, it's run by Guyanans, and I've never really thought of Guyana as having Caribbean food, though of course if you look at the map it makes sense. Thank goodness I decided to give it a try. This ranks among some of the tastiest Caribbean food I've ever had.  The menu is varied and authentic. Basically there's three preparation methods - curry, jerk, and Guyanese specialties. These can be served over rice or with Roti (that's the Indian influence in Guyana). You also pick chicken, fish, goat, or veggie. The curry is amazing, with rice or with roti - and it's good cuts of chicken (a mix or brown and white) - not leftover parts you get in other similar inexpensive places. The specialties are also great - try the Brown Stew or Pepper Pot.  I've had three or four items now, sometimes the lunch bowls (cheap!) and other times the dinner plates with rice and vegetable slaw included. I've never had a bad experience. I should also mention that the people are relentlessly friendly and helpful, and the eating area is spotless and painted in festive Caribbean colors and murals.

We're lucky to have Republic R+N in the Valley, let alone Tempe. It's an amazing ramen cafe - with six different broths and a dozen different add-ins from which to choose. Plus they just expanded the menu to include other classic fast Japanese favorites - curry, udon combos, etc. The space is beautiful, and the employees - every last one of them - are so friendly and helpful and accommodating. This is such a five star place!!!!  Minor quibbles - extra spicy broth is almost indistinguishable from normal broth, and the curry is not traditional Japanese curry. It's OK, but not what you'd expect. Major quibble - what they charge for protein is simply outrageous. A few sprinklings of chicken, a few slices of pork or beef, a few cubes of tofu = two dollars added on??? An already pricey $7 bowl becomes a $10 bowl including tax because a (very) little protein is added? Unless this is Kobe beef, this is outrageous. Penny wise and pound foolish guys - triple the protein you serve or cut its price in half. The current pricing is crazy.  C'mon guys - you're so five stars, just fix the protein problem! In the meantime, dear reader, this is still a place to relish at any price.

So many of the reviews hate on this place because of the small menu - so what? You want a big menu? Head to Taco Bell or Denny's. You want a cute little taco shack that decided they're going to focus on perfecting two meats - carne asada and pork al pastor - then put it in tacos, burritos, or on a vampiro? Then this is your place. And randomly, they have grilled corn on the cob as well!   This is the best pastor I've ever had by far. And the second best carne asada (after the taco cart behind Charlie's on 7th Ave in Phoenix). They cook up everything fresh and to order, yet are still lightning fast. And if you're in the mood to hang out, their outside area is great: benches, heat lamps, sparkly lights.  LOVE THIS PLACE.

Thanks fellow Yelpers for helping me feel less crazy. I saw all the five star reviews so contacted them via the email listed on their website, as well as voicemail. I had odds and ends that needed to be fixed or checked at my home. They initially replied to my email suggesting a possible time they could come by, to which I replied and suggested a different time (actually lots of different days and huge blocks of time that would work) since they time they suggested I would't be available. They never replied. So I emailed and phoned them another four times over the next month, and could never get anyone to reply. Bizarre, rude, behavior - but it appears this is their MO judged by lots of other reviews on this page. If you don't want a job (too small? any reason...) just say you're not interested so people can move on to another electrician.

Wow. This place is awful. Just so so so awful.  They don't accept credit cards, they have a small selection, and it's kinda dirty. The worst are the employees, though. I was always grateful for a cashier that was just indifferent towards me rather than openly hostile.  I had one experience where I opened a fridge to get a Vitamin Water, and a bottle of water just fell out. As I was picking it up to put it back in, the cashier walked up to me and said I had to buy it. I thought she was joking, so I sort of chuckled, and then her scowl told me she was serious. I explained that I wasn't about to pay for an (undamaged) bottle of water that fell our of her fridge just because I opened it. She then said she'd call the police!!! I walked out and said call 'em - I'm parked there and you can take down my license plate. Then the sketchy customers in the store started heckling me.  That was my last visit.

It pains me to write a negative review - I always get the most expensive haircut here, and then always leave a big tip, and I liked them - been coming here for years. Then they switched from paper based reward system to computer (good), and they asked me for my cards to put on the computer last time I was in (good), but then none of my six "Stars" made it to the online system.  Sp...I stopped in once, and they promised they'd check into it and call back. Nothing. I called and left a message, and was promised they'd look into it and call back. Nothing. I emailed them and waited for a reply. Nothing. Its just a shame - to treat, and lose, a customer over something so easily fixed as a free haircut (six "rewards stars").

NEVER NEVER NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!! I ordered on Eat24.com and Dinghao promised delivery in 45-60 minutes. After 1.5 hours I called Eat24 who called them - they said 20 more minutes. After another hour (2.5 hours total), I called Eat24 again, who called them again, and they said it was on the way. After another half hour (3 hours total) I contacted Eat24 again, who contacted them again, and they said they had been at my house and knocked 5 times but I didn't answer. TOTAL LIE - I was here the whole time and I have a motion activated sensor at my front door that activates a video and pings my iPhone whenever someone is within five feet of my front door (Ring Doorbell is the name of the productl) and they were never hear. Plus my dogs go nuts when someone is at the door.  And they claimed to Eat24 that my food had "gone bad" in the ten minutes since they had supposedly been at my house so they weren't going to "come back" - and anyway they were closed now they claimed (I ordered at 7 and it was now 10:15p). NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE, and if Eat24 doesn't drop them from their list, avoid Eat24 as well since they will keep on clients that treat their customers this way. I still cannot believe I spent an entire Saturday night dealing with this awful place, and still ended up with an empty stomach when it was all over.
