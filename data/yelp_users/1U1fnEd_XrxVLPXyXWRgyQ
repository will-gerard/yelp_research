Wow. I expected more from these guys. I had only heard good things but I will never consign with them again: here's why-  After picking up my two piece sectional (in great condition, less than a year old) and another sofa couch, great condition as well.. I received an email from the manager telling me that due to small marks on the back of one of the sectional pieces, they may not be able to sell the couch and that they would just donate it. Absolutely not! I will take it back before you just donate it.  Once I saw it on their site and that they sold it for $895 I went in to receive my 45% cash value which then come to find out they sold it for $495, NOT $895. Such a rip off so for two piece sectional and couch I got $330 cash when I could have probably got $1000 for all them anywhere else.   Never ever again. Rip off crooks.

Two words: Breakfast. Buzz. That's all you need to know. Super friendly staff. Line may look long at times but it goes quickly.

One of my favorite spots for breakfast in Old Town! I always recommend it to customers. They've only forgotten an item or two before but have always brought it out immediately and apologetically. Staff is great. Coffee drinks are amazing. Turkey sausage is delicious. Oatmeal is top notch. Protein pancakes are one of my favorites. Gotta try this place if you haven't yet!

Always love coming here! I agree with another review, not sure why the reviews aren't higher. We always have a great experience. Today is Memorial Day, so the wait was a little longer and it's been a while to receive our food (still haven't as I write this) but I noticed the main guy we see walkin around.. I think he's the manager? He isn't here today.. It's a girl this time. Haven't seen her check on tables or anything like he does. But he always came to our table to say hi, check up and gave us free drinks before because the wait. Awesome guy! We definitely always come back!

I understand now why this location has a two star rating. Probably needs a 1 star. I've ordered twice now from them for delivery within the past two weeks. My office is .3 miles from their location. Literally across Mayo Blvd. both times it has taken them over, I repeat OVER 1.5 hours to deliver. Every time I called in they said "we are making it now" that was within 15 minutes of placing the order.   Figure it out. Hire more drivers? Just an idea.

YUM! I got the eggs florentine, boyfriend got the smoked salmon Benedict and friend got breakfast sandwich. All delicious and beautifully presented. Only downfall was wait time... Felt like it should've been quicker.. But worth the wait overall.

One of my favorite spots to eat in Scottsdale! Been there 3 times now and it's been perfect every time. I think my favorites so far are the wings- we always get those to start. (My BF and I are wing fanatics and they're yummy here!!) and the Thai chicken bowl.. Omg. I do no cabbage, extra rice and beans and add avocado. YUM. If you like spicy food this is the spot- almost everything has a little kick to it.

Delicious! One of my favorite spots. Just make sure you go with enough time to spare cause there's always a line and they aren't the quickest... Be prepared for a wait. Also they should pre cut the fruit and veggies in the cups like Chopshop does. Much quicker.

Awesome atmosphere- excellent food. All the house rolls are amazing looking- we got the ultimate philly to start- yum!!! Happy hour prices are great- half off basically. Cool bar that's half inside half outside. Server was cool and super excited to serve - it was slow (only open 2 weeks) but definitely will be coming back. Open till 12am on weekends!
