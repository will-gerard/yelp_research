We were excited to try this local pizza restaurant for dinner and ordered a sausage pizza on whole wheat. It was the most tasteless thing I've ever eaten. Too bad, I wanted to like this place.

Whether you're a long time runner or just starting out, the Runner's Den has you covered. The staff is patient and knowledgeable, every person I've worked with there was a runner. They even have you run in shoes before buying them to ensure they fit properly. They also have running clinics on the weekend.

For the price, you can't beat this gym. It's one of the larger locations, so even at peak times you'll still be able to lift, hit the treadmill, or find an elliptical machine. The prices are super reasonable and the equipment is in good working order. They also offer tons of classes from Zumba to yoga. If you're looking to join a gym, I recommend this one. I've been with them for years.

This is such a great vet's office! They are always super friendly and sweet to my kitties. When there was a heart worm scare for cats in the area they even offered free testing.

Sky Harbor is by far my favorite airport, it's easy to navigate, has free Wi-Fi, and provides free cell phone lots if you're waiting to pick someone up. It's a happy accident that it's also my home town airport!

I started visiting FEZ in August of 2010 when I started law school a short walk away. Over the past two and a half years, FEZ has become one of my favorite restaurants (even though my school relocated). The staff is wonderful, they carry my favorite vodka (Hangar 1 from San Fran), and the food is always delicious. Try one of their salads or burgers for a lunch that won't let you down. And for vegetarians there is a delicious, house made black bean burger.

We did not go with Elite Moving, but received a quote from them while trying to determine a company to go with. An agent of the company called even after I emailed him telling him we had gone with another provider. The company agent asked who we decided to go with so he could read us negative things about that company off the internet in an attempt to push us into using Elite Moving. I'm not a fan of any company who tries to win customers through intimidation. After reading the other reviews on here, it looks like we dodged a bullet by not going with Elite Moving.

It's hard to go wrong with Thai food. We did carry out and had red curry tofu and pad se ew. They forgot to give me brown rice, but the food was otherwise good. Cute little restaurant, I'll have to try dining in sometime.

This restaurant is simply one of the best breakfast restaurants in town. US Egg has great pricing, amazing food, and a super friendly staff. We've been eating here for years and have never had a bad experience. My husband will tell you to try the pancakes, I'll tell you to try an omelette. Either way, I'm pretty sure you win.

This restaurant really is the type of place where you feel at home. It's run by a wonderful couple who make the food from scratch daily. Try the lasagna if you're hungry, it's fabulous.

So last night we had our going away party and I can't begin to express how awesome they were to us! We were all seated in the same area and got top notch service. I don't know that I've ever received better service for a large group (30+ people). Thanks for giving us a great last night in Arizona guys!

We came across this restaurant on Groupon and thought we'd give it a try. The food was exceptional, the staff was friendly, and the prices were very reasonable. We will absolutely be back!

Such a cute little restaurant to grab lunch or a late afternoon cup of tea. The staff is always super friendly and they have a fantastic salad bar. I will miss hanging out here between classes now that I'm finished with law school.

Worst breakfast experience of my life. I come from the restaurant industry and usually cut people a good deal of slack. After my breakfast being prepared incorrectly 4 times the owner refused to apologize and said that my breakfast only went back to the kitchen twice. I will not be going back.

My husband is obsessed with breakfast, so it came as no surprise that he told me this morning that he had discovered a new breakfast restaurant that we had to try out. In one word, this place is AMAZING. They use organic products, source locally, and have a very friendly staff. I was also pleasantly surprised to see how reasonable the prices were! So if you are in the mood for a good, wholesome breakfast, this is your scene. If you're wondering why you haven't been here already, it's only been open for six weeks.

We had such a nice dinner here with my parents. The patio was lovely and the pickle chips were amazing! The hot dogs came wrapped in naan rather than a bun which was pretty rad. If you're looking for a reasonably priced fun local restaurant, give this place a try.
