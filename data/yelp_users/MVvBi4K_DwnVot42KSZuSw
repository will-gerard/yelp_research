Ordered the Cattlemen's cut Porter House for $29 and had to send it back twice  due to high amounts of grizzle, fat, and overcooked. I  eventually gave up. One of the worst steaks I have ever eaten, wouldn't have paid $10. Also ordered a House Salad for $8 that consisted of chopped iceberg lettuce and dressing.  Handlebar-J has been a DRINKING establishment for a long time in Scottsdale but they will not make it serving 1/2 inch thick steaks that are full of fat and grizzle (could hardly cut it) and over-cooked TWICE.

As a follow-up to the response from HBJ management I wanted to clarify that your owner did in fact sit with me to explain that the cook/chef was swamped and that "she would cook it herself".  To clarify my review again,,it was the quality of the steak that was sub-par. Both steaks they delivered were thin and full of grizzle,,very hard to eat. I couldn't eat either of them.  At $29 I would expect a better cut, especially since the menu advertises it as your best steak.  I am not that hard to please and have been around the Scottsdale restaurant circuit since the mid 70's. Too many good alternatives for steak in the immediate area to warrant trying this again. I do love the ambiance and the history of your bar but you have to serve a good meal and not dwell on how long you have been there.  This is positive criticism to help you with your next customer.  I don't appreciate the statement that I am the kind of customer that is never happy. When a meal is good I am very happy to report that, when its not this is what Yelp is about.

Excellent Value for Money paid.  The food was well prepared, served in a timely fashion, and overall a highly recommended place for clean and healthy food that won't break the bank.  Service was great, ambiance and location in the Biltmore add a nice touch of class.

Thank goodness for Yelp Reviews when in a pinch.  I was driving around LV to show my son the Old Strip and was hoping to find something reasnoably priced, healthy, and close by.  At first I was surprised that a place could have so many 5 Star reviews but now I understand why.  The menu and the service was good, the food  was well prepared and served at the right tempatures.  They owner told us that we get the $5 Small Business Special and seemed genuinely interested in serving us. A great change to the service we received the night before at The Venetian.  Highly recommended.

Solid 4 Star Restaurant! Very cool and hip venue with clientele to match. A few so so drinks with Patron On--Tap followed by an awesome selection of sushi and various Latin themed entrees. Overall a great experience that would have been 5 Star if the waiter didn't oversell Wagu Nigiri that ended up costing $33 for 3 small pieces.
