Whether you're on a road trip or just in the area, this place is a must! The cafe is delicious for breakfast and the pies are an absolute must! I get the jack Daniels pecan pie every time but you can't go wrong when choosing a homemade pie! This little gem gets me every time!

Second favorite Italian deli in Arizona! Friendly staff, amazing food, huge selection! Only deli I enjoy more is Guidos at Scottsdale and Shea, but that's besides the point. Be sure to call in your order around lunch time as it tends to get really busy! I would recommend Defalco's to anyone looking for a great genuine Italian deli in the area!

Don't waste your time or your money! Went in on Saturday and waited over 2 hours just to be put in the exam room for another hour before seeing the doctor who "agreed" I have tonsillitis.. She prescribed me the wrong meds and dosage which led me to ER two days later. Oh and the less than friendly front desk lady, yeah I'd get rid of her. Probably the worst experience I've ever had in a so called "fast med"
