My family has been using Posters Mostly for years (for both personal and professional projects).  They are reasonably priced for framing and the quality of their work is highly superior.  We have only had posters and photos framed, but they can frame specialty items such as shirts/jerseys.  If you're not quite sure what you want, they will help you find the perfect frame for your item to make it your own.  In my opinion, don't bother with the craft store framers or the franchises.  Visit Posters Mostly, support a local business and get ready to love your favorite artwork even more!

Sam Fox hits the mark again! I had dinner with some friends and we were all impressed. Presentation was well executed and flavor was just as excellent. I had the Parmesan risotto as my entree. I liked the roasted cloves of garlic that gave bursts of flavor. The shrimp was cooked just right, not rubbery. Drinks were not watered down, and were very well priced for dining in and around Old Town and the Waterfront. The atmosphere/decor is spot on as well and the staff was very attentive. Can't wait to go back!

They might have "cookies" in the name, but check out the cupcakes!! Quality of everything is top notch and the innovative flavors of their cupcakes can't be beat!!  Their snickerdoodle is hands down the best in the valley. Great balance in the cinnamon sugar. Also, the cookie isn't lardy and greasy like other places. As for cupcakes, they hooked me a while back with the cupcake they created when the Broncos were in the Super Bowl. A chocolate cupcake with marshmallow frosting piled on dipped in chocolate ganache. Still the best cupcake I've ever had. Other creative flavors have been surprisingly good as well: pub cheese and IPA beer, Moscow mule, gourmet corn dog. (Yeah, they really put a piece of sausage on a cupcake and made it work.)  And, every visit the staff has always been super friendly. Whoever does the hiring knows what they're doing.

It is great to have an aquarium in Phoenix, but if you have been to any other aquarium (or fish department at your local pet store for that matter) you may be disappointed.  Based on the height of the exhibits, it is apparent that Sea Life is geared to a younger audience.  Little kids will find this place fascinating.  Older kids not so much.  There are domes built into some of the tanks that allow small kids to crawl under the tank and stand in the middle and look through the tank (very fun for a young child, I'm sure).  The best part of the aquarium by far is the 360-degree tunnel that goes through one of their tanks.  It is pretty awesome to see water below your feet and all around (though I didn't take my time standing on the glass).  If you are considering a visit to Sea Life, try to find a coupon for discounted admission...

There are a lot of mixed reviews, but I was happy with my visit. Went for dinner with some friends and we split the mozzarella and tomato salad and the grilled calamari appetizer. The mozzarella/tomato I could have put together just as well at home, but the calamari was superb. Great flavor and grilling it was a great twist over fried. Every Italian restaurant has fried calamari but I've never seen grilled before. We were going to split pizza, but they ran out. I will give them that we were there late (got there at 8) after the dinner crowd, but still seemed odd. I ended up ordering the penne bolognese which was delicious. Again...they put their twist on it. The meat sauce was made with veal. So good! The restaurant itself is not big at all, but you don't feel cramped. Tables are just far enough and the tall ceiling makes it feel open. I would definitely go back (with the hope that they're not out of pizza). The food overall was great and the staff could not have been more friendly. It felt like we were friends with our server and this was a first visit for all of us. If you're on the fence, definitely give this place a try!!

It has been a while since I've been this excited about a new place.  I have passed by countless times, but finally decided to check this place out and I took my mom for brunch for Mother's Day.  I went back for dinner this past weekend I liked it so much.  Both times the service was great and the food was delicious!  When I went for brunch I ordered the chilaquiles and Kitchen 56 is easily at the top of the list for great chilaquiles.  The perfect amount of spice (enough to taste it and give a good kick  without being over the top) in the sauce and the flour tortillas weren't greasy at all.  So often when the tortillas are fried in-house they come out greasy and more stale than crisp, but they were crunchy.  I tried the backporch 'adult' lemonade.  It was very refreshing and not overly sweet which I loved.  For my second visit I ordered the Short Ribs from the dinner menu and they were amazing! The meat was fork tender and tasty!  The mashed potatoes were seasoned well and had a great black pepper kick to them.  They were are little thicker and starchier than I would usually prefer (but that just proved that they were fresh made in house and not rehydrated out of a box which is the way I like it!!).  I also split the beet salad and it was amazing!  The balsamic dressing has a great bite to it without being too acidic from the vinegar and it goes so well with the crispy pancetta and goat cheese.  With the right protein the salad could easily be an entree meal!  I may have overindulged a bit when it comes to cocktails, but I tried the Moscow Mule and the '56' Cooler.  The Mule was spot on for what you'd expect.  I was intrigued by the '56' Cooler because it was basically a margarita with St Germain.....something about St Germain just draws me in.  Great balance of flavors between the grapefruit juice and the St Germain!  I can't wait to go again and try something else new on the menu.  I can't imagine that I'd be disappointed with anything on the menu!

Went for drinks with some friends and really did not take advantage of the sports aspect of this sports bar.  The bar has a great vibe.  The staff was friendly and service was fair.  I say fair because of the speed of service.  You can't expect immediate service at a bar on a Saturday night in Old Town, but for the size of the bar, there should have been more than 2 bartenders.  There is a lot of seating inside and out.  And, even though it is loud and was busy, you feel like you can relax and enjoy yourself.  You don't have to deal with the "rowdiness" of a bar with a dance floor.  Overall?  I would say that Majerle's is worth a stop in.

Chloe's is one of the best new restaurants to hit downtown! I've visited several times for lunch and cannot say enough good things about Chloe's. They are just consistently good. And, the nice thing about this restaurant is they are great for a quick grab-and-go as well as a leisurely lunch.  The salad bar has veggies and extras that have always been nice and fresh...nothing that looked like it was sitting out for too long. The sandwich menu has a great variety. I've had the chipotle-raspberry turkey sandwich. It had just the right amount of spice and spread. Also, the ciabatta roll it was served on was not too hard as ciabattas can be sometimes.  As far as desserts, they have a wonderful selection of those too. I've had the chocolate snickerdoodle and triple chocolate chip cookies. The chocolate snickerdoodle is something I've never seen before and is so much more delicious than the traditional snickerdoodle. The triple chocolate chip was not lacking in chips. It was just the right texture as well...not dry, but a firm cookie with a good chew to it.  I really can't praise Chloe's enough...it is certainly worth trying and going back over and over again!

This location is one of my favorites, and while I have two others that are a little closer to my office, I make the effort to walk to this location.  The staff is amazingly friendly.  Also, they can really move customers through so that even with a long line you aren't stuck waiting for too long.  What makes this even better is that you still get that personal connection and friendliness that you hope for when you walk into a Starbucks.

I finally made it back to Salty Sow...thanks to a BOGO mailer that I received.  Once I got the mailer, I hopped on OpenTable and made a reservation and went in for a late lunch.  The fact that a place uses OpenTable gives it a little boost in my book.  The waitress was very welcoming and friendly and did a great job explaining the menu and concept and welcoming me back.  I ordered the slow-roasted beef shoulder and was not disappointed.  The root vegetables in the dish were perfectly cooked.  I ordered their version of a Moscow mule and enjoyed it.  I'm glad I tried the restaurant again because I was pleased with the meal.  I don't know that it will become a regular place for me to dine, but I wouldn't be averse to going back if someone suggests it.  I'd be even more tempted to go if I received another BOGO mailer....

If you are looking to have some fun, this is definitely the place to go!  The good? This place is always high energy!  The resident DJs play some excellent music and the staff is pretty friendly.  Also, the lighting and the dancefloor space is on par with what you would expect from a higher end nightclub, but I honestly don't get the mirror ball over the dance floor...I mean what is the netting/webbing around it really there for??  The bad? There has been a cover every time I've gone (even when it is just a resident DJ and not a special headliner).  It is a little annoying to pay a $10-$15 cover plus $8 for well cocktails.

The Scottsdale location was my introduction to Cornish and what a spot it is! Love the relaxed vibe and the patio is an awesome space.  I wasn't too sold on a pasty until I had one.  I couldn't wrap my brain around the concept for some reason.  I've been quite a few times now and each time I go I try a new pasty and haven't had a bad one yet.  My favorite is a tie between the Reuben and The Shepherd's Pie.  The beer list is extensive if you like beer.  I always go for the Moscow Mule they have to offer (thanks for using Crabbie's ginger beer!).

I've been to Pizza Studio several times now and I can't believe I haven't written a review yet...  The first time I went in I wasn't sure how things worked, but the employees gave a quick intro.  It doesn't take long to realize though that the place pretty much runs like a Subway but for pizza.  The ingredients are fresh and the pricing is very reasonable.  You can get your own personalized pizza and a drink for around $10.  The line always moves quickly and the pizza doesn't take more than a few minutes to bake.  The crust bakes perfectly every time...a nice think crust that is perfectly crispy around the edges.  This is a must try for a good lunch downtown!

Excellent place to go for service! The owner is extremely helpful and informative.  I have been multiple times for service and each time I leave knowing that I can trust the work that I had done.  It is rare to go to any business that deals with cars and feel like you've been educated and informed instead of pressured into paying for something you don't need.  No questions about it, I will be back!!

This is a pretty awesome new venue.  I've been a few times just for drinks and I also went to see Steve Aoki in February for his Neon Future Experience tour.  Drinks are reasonably priced. I like that the bar is floating instead of backed up against a well. Allows for faster service time! The lights and sound system are pretty killer. The venue definitely didn't skimp and rely on acts bringing in their own stuff. Awesome for a show!

I've been once and am having a hard time convincing myself to go back.  If I do...I'll definitely try the Brussels sprout nachos as I've heard nothing but good things about them.  My one and only visit so far was with a group of 6 friends.  We went on a weekend night a bit later in the evening....probably around 8.  We had no issue getting seated, but getting service was a different story.  Our took our drink order and the first round was delivered promptly, but then she disappeared and we had to wait a while to be able to put in our food order.  It took even longer for our food to be brought out to us.  I will say that the food was delicious once we got it.  The server didn't check back on us and one of us had to actually get up and ask for service for water even.  I understand a wait on a busy weekend night, but the restaurant was practically empty.  Perhaps they were understaffed that night, but if that is the case give us the FYI.  Otherwise, it just seems like we are being neglected.  If someone suggests the place to meet up, I would go back, but I don't have any big desire to make the effort to go.

I had a wonderful dinner here! The atmosphere is great.  Very warm and inviting.  We were treated to a yummy flatbread that the restuarant offers instead of the traditional loaf or sliced bread.  The flatbread came with two jams that must both be tried!  I ordered the KW Smoked Brisket Burger for my entree.  I was surprised to find the burger had two patties and the brisket was sandwiched between them! The overall presentation was very well thought out on a board and the burger was served with roasted fingerling potatoes instead of plain old french fries.  It was a great touch to show just the right amount of extra effort to make the meal more upscale without making it over the top.  Our server was perfectly attentive without being overbearing and service was great from the first hello to the last goodbye.  This is definitely be a spot to go back to!
