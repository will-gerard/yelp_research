Definitely a place to avoid.  Hopefully it is short lived.  Food actually used to be good, not any longer.  Prices are as other reviewers have noted, absurdly high.  Service is not good.  The salsa,,,bland.  And being the room is small and there were several business diners who have not the tact to keep their voices down, the place was deafening.  Guess one should take a clue as you walk in past dead and dying plants around the place that something has gone very wrong.  Hopefully, the next occupant will be observant of detail.

I had a break in a week ago, and these guys were referred to me.  All I can say is amazing service.  They did their job expertly, were very easy to deal with and as far as I am concerned are as good as it gets for sure.

My cousins and I eat out often and have eaten at Los Dos in many of the locations over the years so decided to go to the new one on Camelback.  Bad mistake.  Walk in the place is a din of noise.  We were seated promptly four of us, one menu.  Took forever for a waiter to return with , one more menu.  Finally the waiter returns took our order and service was pretty quick for the food to get to us.  I had posole which actually was tasty but would have been a lot better if it had been hot, it was just luke warm.  No time did our waiter ever return to fill ice tea glasses, and finally when we were  done he did return and fortunately did not ask how it was.  We had to ask twice for a carry home box.  The salsa of Los Dos is gone replaced by some gringo salsa.  The food is fair not great.  The service terrible.  Ambiance great.  Noise level high.  Worth trying again....nope.  Many people at different tables were complaining of getting no service.  I will await to see what moves in here because Los Dos is not long for this world at this location.
