Called them today for a light fixture that wasn't working in my bathroom.  That was literally less than 3 hours ago and it's already fixed and done!  Even looked at another quick problem that I was having and resolved it.  Quick call back and quick service!! Great company.  I'll use them again and I definitely recommend them!

These guys are great.  First went to get my brakes fixed and I was shocked at how inexpensive, quick and easy it was!  Came back for an oil change and once again they were great.  They will mention if you've got additional work they recommend (which has never been much) but they never pressure you!  I definitely recommend these guys!

Terrible. First impression- walked in, approached a table and a gentleman stormed up and stated "you can't sit here, you need to leave this table".   Ok.   Confronted him after a short while and apparently he is one of the owners?  John?  After an amory of excuses, (so stressed out, bad night, etc) he offered to buy us our first round of drinks and I accepted the offer.  Bad idea.   The evening progressed and our friend approached us telling us he was leaving.  What?   He had been "kicked out" by a bartender who believed that our disabled friend, who had an accident several months prior and couldn't quite walk properly was over the limit.  Unbelievable.  This upset me and I started crying!  After confronting the owner "John", he stated that there was nothing he could do, so we were invited to leave.  Unbelievable again!   I will never go back to this establishment.  Being in the hospitality industry myself, I was greeted with noting but excuses and fabrications that would never fly in my industry.  Please note that this review was written after having the exact same number of drinks that my "overly intoxicated" kicked out friend has had.  I will never go to this establishment again nor will I ever recommend to my friends.
