Been coming here for over 5 years and I'll never go anywhere else! Su and Ilene are amazing. So particular about their work which is great for an OCD person like myself :-) I always get so many compliments everywhere I go. Their spa is so cleanly and everyone's so polite, I wouldn't go anywhere else! Plus since the expansion this place is huge and beautiful!

The yogurt flavors seems far from what advertised, no chance to sample them before hand either. I had 4 small portions of different flavors and none were great. The "fresh strawberries" were far from that. Was obvious they were nearing their shelf life, chopped and the frozen. The truffle was very bitter, pure cocoa.

Surprisingly so much fun! The intro class was really easy to keep up with and the staff is amazing, especially Alek! Having the little pup walk around the studio makes you feel you're apart of their family and oh so welcomed. Absolutely will be telling my bridal party this would be a blast for part of my bachelorette weekend next year :-D

The Arizonan dog is so delicious! I'm picky with my guacamole and there were now chunks of onions which was a major plus for me now when it comes to dessert their banana Twinkie is a MUST try! Banana topped with creamy PB and Nutella held together with a Twinkie bun, so delicious! Will be back for a burger next.
