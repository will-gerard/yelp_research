Once again, we're impressed with the level of service we get from Wilhelm when maintaining our cars. This allows us to keep our higher mileage cars for longer without being concerned for their reliability.

They never answered their phone. Maybe they're out of business?

We get takeout for the family a couple times a month on average. Pretty good food, and awfully consistent flavor and quality.

I was brought here by a friend of mine who raved about the Veggie Grilled Cheese sandwich.  I had fully intended to get the same sandwich myself until I saw that they offered a Monte Cristo. I haven't had a Monte Cristo since the last time I was at Disneyland (at the Blue Bayou) so nostalgia won out. My sandwich and home made potato 'chips' were fantastic (I added a little malt vinegar and salt to them) - and for a drink I had delicious iced green tea (which somehow tasted like fruit loops). I'll be back next time I'm in the area.

I just returned from my first visit to this shop for a men's cut. While the shop just opened in the past week or so, the buildout was tastefully done. I had no problem communicating what I was looking for in a cut, and was very happy with how it turned out. My cut was $15.

I thought about changing my older review, but I thought I'd leave it I hopes that my frustration with them is a temporary thing. Monday I left work a little early to make sure I get to this shop before closing.  I had double checked the hours here on yelp.  I arrived to find that they are closed on Monday's. Today, Tuesday, I drove over after work to finally get that haircut. This time I arrived at 5:47 to see a handwritten note on the door saying that they are closing today at 5:45. I'm not sure if I've got the patience to try again. Maybe I'll give V's at Norterra a shot.

Won't be returning. Came for breakfast because the website said they had waffles. Our server said they discontinued waffles because they were too popular and couldn't keep up with the demand. ... Wow. Additionally, I wonder what happened in that parking lot for them to need to put 'Don't park here unless you are a Marley's customer' signs on every spot?  It doesn't appear to be a terribly busy lot.

It's cold stone. Pretty tasty, overpriced ice cream served by disinterested teenage girls. Still worth coming for an ice cream for my birthday.

This review is about a tuxedo rental from this location that nearly went wrong.  Because it contains all of the details of my story, I'm going to include the email I sent in to Jos a Bank customer service.  ________________________  On the 28th of August 2013 I visited a Jos a Bank location at 20028 N 67th Ave in Glendale AZ and a friendly representative named X helped me get measured and choose a tuxedo for a black tie event I was attending on Sept 14th.   After choosing and ordering the rental, none of the point of sale computers were able to ring me up for the rental or even a deposit, but X let me know that I could pay in full when I picked up the Tuxedo.   On the Monday before my event, I called the store to inquire when I was to expect to be able to come in and try on my tuxedo, and was told by the woman on the phone that it wasn't in store yet, but assured me I would be called when it had arrived.   On the Thursday before the event, I called the store again wondering about the status of my order, this time speaking with X, who after researching found that the order for my tuxedo had been canceled and that she would arrange for it to be re-ordered and next-day shipped to the store and would be ready for me to come in and try on Friday (the day before my event).   I was notified by a phone call from the store that my rental had arrived on Friday & drove there to try it on and pick it up.  Fortunately, the fit was fine (X had done a good job!) but I was surprised that I wasn't offered any sort of discount for my nearly averted formal wear catastrophe.   I've been shopping at Jos a Bank for a few years for suits for work and other various dress clothes, but this series of events has left me feeling like I should shop elsewhere (not the least is the profound feeling that I will NEVER rent formal wear from Jos a Bank).  I do want to be clear that I do not think that there was any negligence on the part of the sales associate X, but it seems that the underlying systems failed in both the cancellation of my original order and the fact that it didn't appear that X was empowered to do anything but offer me words of apology.   ________________________  A day later, I got an email from customer service instructing me to call into an 800 number and speak to one of two names.  Below is the response I sent:  _________________________  I tried calling in - got put immediately into a queue without speaking to a human - waited and listened to repetitive music for 2 mins before a machine tried to have me leave a message.   It's not clear to me what more I could say in a voicemail than I did in my original lengthily and descriptive email.  How about if you have any questions for me, email them as the telephone method seems less reliable.   _________________________  Two days later, I got another email stating the I'd be contacted by the regional sales director.  I missed his phone call, and he left a voicemail.  At this point I was pretty tired of the entire situation and so when I reached HIS voicemail I told him that I'm not fishing for a refund or some sort of discount - I simply was trying to let them know about how their underlying sales systems had broken down and nearly failed me. I never heard another word via phone or email.  TL;DR I'm not shopping at Jos A Bank any more, especially not for formal wear rentals.
