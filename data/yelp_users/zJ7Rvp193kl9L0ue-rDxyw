Stunning location and very nice layout.  Wish the tickets were a little less than they are but if it keeps the place going I might go a bit less but.....

I don't always get to sell everything for the price I want, some of the prices are higher than some other places but great selection, good deals most of the time, and very cool & knowledgable staff.  Great place.  4/5.

I used to love this place and was sad it closed.  I spent many hours at the bar, watching tv, chatting with the crew, and munching some wonderful cajun eats.  It was a gas around the turn of the millenium and, as I said earlier, I was sad to hear of it's decline followed by it's ultimate failure.

He can be very straight forward and sometimes a bit blunt even.  He does seem to care about his patients and comes across as very knowledgeable as he has pointed out things that no other doctor has.  I am rather impressed so far.

They treated me well the few times I have been here.  The speed of service has been good, even when busy.  Their bagels and schmeer have been consistently good.

While I do not do much with jewelry, Ganem regularly seems to have a beautiful and varied selection.  The staff is usually both professional and curtious.  I often go there for investment reasons:  usually investment grade silver coins with the rare gram of gold.  Curtis and James usually help me out with that and have been unfailingly great to work with so far.    The only downside is that they can get a bit busy on the weekends.  They, however, do hussle in those situations and seem to try to balance good with fast service.

Yeah, it's kind of a dive bar.  Fun environment, lots of tvs, decent eats, good drink prices and a jukebox or live music depending on the night.  Who says you can't love a dive bar?  I do.  If I still lived in Tukee I'd likely be there WAY too often.

I've been going to Arizona's Vision since I came back to the valley in 2006.  Originally I went due to close proximity and I saw a few commercials.  I seem to recall the first appointment I had was with Dr. Mark Page, who is the lead doctor there.  Since I have been getting checked out by Dr. Yamamoto.    Their staff has been unconditionally nice and professional on every visit.  The doctors are friendly and seem to be very adept at what they do.  Their selection of frames have been more than satisfactory as far as I am concerned.    Their optical mapping technique is very cool, though I wish it was covered by most insurance.  Since it's not, they charge 29.99 which, if you can afford it, is a very nice alternative to being dilated.  You have the option of dilation, which is included in the exam, but the mapping does not have the temporary though annoying side effects.  (I thought it was creepy but cool seeing what they saw though.)    I don't know how they compare cost wise to others in the valley, since I have not gone elsewhere, but I intend to stay with them as long as I can as they're the best eye doctors I've had in a while.  I'd totally recommend them to anyone in the valley, especially if  they're in the Tukee area.

It's a bit out of the way, and I am more familiar with the Chandler yard, but this location is now the closer of the 2.  I've only been there a few times, so the getting in and out is a bit confusing still.    The staff has always been rather cool, however, and generally have been helpful.  Not like aluminum or steel is as valuable as silver or gold, but it's nice to be able to recycle it AND get a bit of money back.    4 out of 5 stars so far.  :)

The food was pretty good for BK.  The service was fast and the value menu has decent deals.  However my past two visits had errors though.  Fries rather than onion  rings last time, despite being clear.  I also asked ranch to go with my onion rings this time and they forgot that.  They'd have gotten 3 or 4 stars if they'd not left stuff out twice in a row.

Personally, I used to come here a lot more often than I do.  I've noticed, what I feel to be, a rather slide in the quality in the food.  The carne asada burrito I recently got tasted okay, but the meat tasted lesser quality than I was used to.  The guacamole was a bit thinner than i like.  I gave them this score due to them having much better history with me and I hope/think/suspect  they had a weak day.  If they do better or worse next time, I'll post something that will reflect it.

I've lived in this complex twice.  The first time was from October 2006 until April 2008, the second being October 2011 until December 2012.    To be honest, the first stretch I would have given the place 4 stars.  The only reason I moved was because the owner at the time, ConAm, decided to go condo and was not renewing leases.  The apartment i lived in was kinda small at 625 sq feet but it fit my needs, the price was right and not far from my job.  The office staff was also very nice.  When I left, no fees and good feelings all around.  When I came into the market to move again, I found out ConAm still owned the place and they were renting again figuring the condo gig wasn't a great idea.  I felt a little uncomfortable as the new agent pidgeon holed me into a place of the same size as I had before and wanted, but it was on the lake side rather than the side I lived before and closer to Dobson Road where I worried about road noise.  There was another of the size I wanted but it was not going to be ready for another 7 days which they insisted could not be ready any earlier.    I let myself get talked into the place, which was my bad entirely.  I paid the deposits and came in to the sign the lease.  We covered the paperwork which for the most part was run of the mill. I rather balked when they told me if I wanted to move to another apartment after my lease is up it'd be a $500 deposit.  No mention was made and I did not recall seeing mention of cleaning fees unless I left the place in disrepair.  Well, the road noise wasn't horrid.  The lake was nice however on the other side of the lake where I was ended up being a nice view of a back side of a shopping center and the patio of a bar.  The TV was routed through a central satellite system like the last time but the provider now charged either an additional bi annual or quarterly maintenance fee, with no cable available and no individual satellite setup available for north facing apartments.    Now, right about the time my lease was ending ConAm sold the property to Medrona Ridge Residential.  The notification went out hardly a week or so before the transition took place.  The management companies were nice enough not to charge me a month to month fee as I told them I was looking for a new job and was worried about a lease since I did not know where I would be.    The new management was pretty nice to me for my remaining time there.  I did have to move as I found a new job that was pretty much on the far side of town, at least most of the way.  After having been unemployed for 6 months and being on shaky financial ground, a 150 mile commute a week didn't make a lot of sense.  I thanked them for their pleasant service and promised a positive review if the service kept being so good.  Imagine my surprise when I got a $120 bill for carpet  and apartment cleaning.  I called to question it as it was NOT discussed at the lease signing and I interpreted the lease as being no charges unless the place was in bad repair.    Well, I was told that if I had a carpet cleaners receipt they'd wave that fee.  The apartment cleaning fee was due to it not being move in ready, which boggled me as not ever having been mentioned let alone a criteria with ANY place I'd lived in the past.    Of course I had no grounds to dispute it as the online version of the lease was gone when the old management's site was taken down for that complex, I could not find my lease hard copy and I'd been month to month anyhow.    I asked for a payment plan, to which the manager agreed to however I felt talked down to for the conversation from there on out.  I managed to get the funds together to pay them off, despite robbing Peter to pay Paul as it were, and the staff that was there was nice to me but, honestly,  I'm not sure I can give this place a positive review.  The place I am at now costs less than the $1 per square foot than I was paying here, the place I am at now also has newer appliances than I had at Lakeside, more space and some of my utilities are actually covered where I had to pay for everything there.

I'd never been to a Pita Jungle until my friends invited me to dinner with them there.  I'd seen the place many times but until I got the invite, I'd not seen the draw.    We started off splitting a hummus and pita appetizer.  It was delicious!  Great texture, beautiful amounts of garlic with cucumber and tomato slices on the side to go with the pitas.  My friends raved about the gyros (seemed a bit odd to me that they had lettuce but, they did not complain.)  I got the beef philly pita, being a rebel.  It was a bit juicier than I expected, and I have had better but I enjoyed it more than I expected.  The staff was reasonably fast despite it being a rather packed house and was unfailingly nice.  Not many places would be that busy yet that fast and pleasant.    If I was a bit more in love with the Philly, I might have given 5 stars but I will very much consider going back some time in the future.  Very much a place to go with friends!

I decided to check this place out after having driven by it numerous times and had a few friend say that they liked the place a fair deal.  I was hungry and craving chinese, so why not I figured.  Called in to see if they were open and they were, but hearing that they had an hour wait, I elected to carry out.  15-20 minutes is about average so I didn't say boo.  25 minute prep time isn't too far outside of the estimate and they were busy after all.  The barbecue pork lo-mein was not the best ever.  Pork had a fatty texture, and the dish as a whole was okay though a bit bland.  The duck won ton soup was pretty good....Right until I got to the meat.  Almost every piece had either bones or bone chips in it.  I am not sure if that is a normal part of how it's made, but I have never experienced the like before and it was a put off.  The experience over the phone and waiting was fair.  The place was packed due to being one of the rare places open Christmas night  and I understand the pressure of being a host or hostess in this situation, but I saw this girl loose her composure a few times in the 15 minutes I was there, once pretty majorly.  With the bones, fatty flavor and other worries, I managed a few bites overall before my $20 meal went into the garbage disposal or trash.  I'm stunned with the overwhelming good reviews, as my experience was so weak as I had pretty much a poor experience overall and a lot of disappointment.  I may or may not give them another shot in the future.  At the moment, I doubt it.

My first time to this McDonalds in....well, I cant remember.  The service wasn't horrid.  It was a bit slow even considering the line through the drive through.  Maybe I was just tired and grumpy....  I am a bit annoyed that I asked for dips for my McNuggets and they gave me NONE.  Not the worst out there.  They may get another chance but I am far from wowed at this rate.

For weekends spanning from February to April, take a journey to rural Arizona masquerading as medieval Europe for a day of fun, fantasy and entertainment.    Located in Apache Junction, the Arizona Renaissance Festival goes on for 2 months per year on it's own campus modeled on a middle ages period town.  Throughout the day, there are shows, food and fun to be had while you explore the shire.  The shows vary from family friendly to adventurous to rather bawdy.  The food is modeled after period food modified to modern standards to fit varied tastes. In costume or not, with friends or solo a good time can be had by all.    Huzzah for good times in a time long, long ago at a place not very far away.....

I've been going to the Arizona Renaissance Festival for years now.  It's a total blast in my opinion.  There are a variety of shows and events that range from family friendly to risque.  They include the obligatory joust, comedy, acrobatics, music, falconry and more.    The games or extra, but the performances are included in the admission.  Many do ask for donations and offer merchandise, often toward the end of the show, but from what I am told, these folks don't really get much if anything from the Festival folks and rely on donations + sales to actually live on.  They're optional, but as they often say, appreciated.    I heard someone say the shops there are Chinese-Import quality junk.  That may be true in 1 or 2 cases, but a majority are not only very nice quality but hand crafted.  Hand made glass crafts, weaponry that is combat rated and that has a lifetime warranty, and some sweet clothing being some examples.  Many items have been purchased there by myself and friends with neigh a complaint.    There is also a variety of food.  If the turkey legs are not your style, there are stews, skewers, chowders, and pizza to nibbles like pickles, jerky and pretzels.   For a bit more, you can get into the pleasure feast which is a usually good to great 5 course meal with 90 minutes of entertainment, included drinks (beer, wine and soda), a goblet that you get to keep, plus general admission to the Festival.  That, in my opinion, is worth it at least once if you can foot the extra.  It's usually been a fun experience for me.    Not sure what is up with the dissenters but, whatever.  I like this place enough to give it a rare 5 stars and would very much recommend it for a day of history minus the Plague and fun added.

FRD is pretty much an average bar without much to distunguish it aside from being stumbling distance from home.  They have poker a couple times a week as well as karaoke along with a band evey once in a while.    They've an ok to fair selection of beer (no Guinness shockingly enough) and liquor.  The food is tolerable for bar food, but I have had much better at other bars.  Service happens to depend who's on duty.  Some of their bartenders have been awesome while others...well, not so much.  Overall, if you're looking for a place to toss back a few, play some poker or sing some karaoke in an okay but not necessarily stunning place and you're close by, check it out.    Not a place I'd suggest if you've got to cross town for or want a higher end / glitzy establishment though.

I've visited this store a number of times.  The staff is generally nice and knows their stuff.  After a little dissapointment with some phones and services, I finally found a service I liked and a phone I can deal with....  The big issue were the contacts.  The software was not available to xfer them at the time.  The VZW retail store couldn't help.  I finally landed some time with the lovely and charming Kelly.  She went out of her way to get my contacts restored to my new phone and succeeded where everyone else failed me on it.    I appreciate the efforts of the other staff, but I want to give big kudos to Kelly!  You're awesome, lady.  You make the Shack rock!

I am not a fan of getting poked by needles but it's a necessary evil for a thrombollic diabetic like myself.  The folks here are generally very gentle and able sofar as drawing blood, with a rare exception.    The only screw up was my first visit to this location when they somehow pulled a 9 year old order on my first visit and sent it to the wrong doctor rather than my current PCP.  They did get it fixed, however, and the issue has not repeated itself.

Last time here the service was good but we had a miscommunication which left me a little confused if not miffed.  Honestly, looking back at it I realize that it was a conversation that could've gone better but I wonder how much was my fault vs theirs.    The manger and staff went above and beyond in making amends and they not only provided the good service they provided last time, but were very kind and very appologetic for the misunderstanding.  I really have to compliment how they handled things and for taking wonderful care of me.     I could have asked more questions, and I got a slightly better deal when I lived closer to the last place I got service, but I understand that was a big dealership that made lots of money in sales vs a independent service company who makes their money off of car service.  All in all, I admit that this place offers great service, the prices are not outlandish in my experience, and they seem to honestly care about their customers.  If you live anywhere near 82nd Street and Indian School, I can honestly recommend this place.   They are worth giving your business to.  I was lukewarm before, but they have gone out of their way to fix things in a way that few other companies would have.    Thank you to Marshall and his crew for being so amazing.

Basic decore, nice staff and some cool entertainment.  Older crowd often times but that is not a bad thing if you are wanting a low key but fun evening.    The staff has always been great and I've never had a bad  time in the place unlike other places in the area I could mention but shan't.

Ya know, it's Sonic.  They've some decent prices (wishing they had more dollar items myself, but hey....) and their food is often decent to good.  I can't see Sonic ever getting a 5 star review in the local magazines but for fast food, it's pretty good.    Just sorry they dont have carside service at this one.

I'd seen this place on tv a while ago and was curious.  I mean seriously.   Mexican / Chinese fusion?!  Well, it sounds whonky and a bit weird.  In function, it is REALLY good.    My first time there was a little daunting.  They were kind enough to let me try a few samples before I dove in since I was a Chino Bandido virgin.  I chose the combo, venturing to try the Emerald Jade Chicken quesadilla and a Jade Red Chicken burrito with refried beans and the plain fried rice.    The Jade Red Chicken was sweet and sour with a bit of kick in a tortilla much like you might get with a moo goo gai pan at places.  It was amazing.  The quesadilla was very nice.  The ginger/green onion sauce was very tasty though there was a bit much on the oil in that sauce.  Otherwise, with the rice and beans, it was delicious.    The staff was very nice from start to end.  The gal who helped me with the samples also took my order and dropped the food off.  Not sure if that is normal, but it was awesome.  She was very sweet and very helpful.  (Hopefully I am not out of line by mentioning she was quite cute too.)   I am not sure how much of a regular I'll be, but for an occasional treat and a Sino-Mexican fix, I'll be back for more!

I'm so sorry the east valley location closed.  It was close and, while the location was nothing fancy as well as being a little hard to find, the food was uniquely amazing.   The staff was pretty awesome too...They always  seemed happy to answer any questions you had and would usually offer info before you asked.  Unfortunately, the remaining location is over 50 miles round trip which makes it tough for me to visit even occasionally.  Worth a try when I can, especially the rare time when I am in the area.

Granted, this review is circa 2001.  I admit that was a while back.  I came here regularly because the staff was bomb, the prices were decent and the food rocked.  I loved coming here with my Borders crew.   I came back in 2004 with a friend, same owners, and they were the bomb diggity.  We got treats, good drinks and the food rocked.  Amanda and Nancy were not any more, which made me sad, but we were treated right and the food was right plus the beer was cold and yummy.  Came back years later and the place was under new ownership.  It went from awesomesauce to suck.  The staff was okay but no where near as cool as they were.  The place was worse.  I came back to Phoenix in 2006.  I wrangled my way up to PV in 2010 to find the place shut down.  That bugged the snot out of me.  I loved the place once.  1 bad experience was a downer, but to find the place totally shut down?!  Bogus.    Borders closed.  Lager Fields Closed.  Big downer man.

This is an unassuming little taco shop that has rockin burritos.  Breakfast burritos, carne asada, chicken and more.  I've yet to be disappointed with the food or the service in general.  Only reason I am not giving this place a 5 out of 5 is due to a couple of times where I had John S.'s issue.  Got a chicken rather than machaka burrito and also got a sausage breakfast burrito rather than a ham another time.  The food was great and these have been rare occasions in my experience, so 4 out of 5.

I like this store a lot!  It has a good selection of dvds and music in stock and if it's not in, it generally can be special ordered.  Rather interesting shirts can be had there it seems.  The incense smells wonderful, I might add.  The staff is the other bonus.  I don't recall ever having bad service there.  The staff is usually rather nice.  My last visit was over the top with first rate customer service and fun conversations.    Before a few days ago it would have gotten a 4 star rating but my last experience was so good, I felt the need to add that 5th star.

I have to admit, I am a fan of Bookmans and have been a customer for years.  The atmosphere is generally laid back and comfortable, which is not common for a lot of stores.  They offer a wide and often eclectic selection.  Now, I've noticed a few comments that are a bit toward the negative side due to not having many items bought.  After having traded with this company for years at many locations, I can tell you, or in some cases confirm, a few points.    When making an offer they look for items that they think will sell (it is a business, not a charity, after all) as well as items that they do not have a large stock of.  They are human, so one buyer may have a slightly different opinion of what looks good or what they consider overstocked so if at first you do not succeed, give it another go if you're in the area in a couple weeks.    They may not have needed it today, but things, if even the buyer, may be different next time around and you may very well get something closer to what you want.  The staff is often friendly and helpful.  I've seen them bend over backwards to help me get what I want.  I've seen a few folks have off days but, again, we're all human.  The few visits that have not been stellar have been made up for time and time again.    I'm very much a fan and rate Bookmans Mesa 4 out of 5 stars for being pretty dang good at what they do and for being one of the greener companies out there.

I used to have this location at 4 stars.  Recently I have had bad experiences.  I understand they buy things that they think they can sell.  I get the hit or miss.    The last few visits I have not been able to trade much, with people offering cash as I was walking out actually in some cases.  The last 3 visits 1 staffer was acting flat exasperated despite the fact I was told by others to swing back every week or few weeks to see if I had better luck.  The STORE MANAGER actually has yanked away gifts from the staff who knew damned well that I've shopped with this company for over 20 years and a loyal customer of this location right in front of me.    I am considering contacting the owner of the chain, and yes, I have met and talked to him before, about the latest experiences.  Until 2015 I was happy to say NOTHING but nice things about this company. 2 people have done a perfect job of torpedoing my opinion of them.  I may change my mind again IF they convince me otherwise.

I never knew this place existed until just the other day.  Finally, I had to give into my urge for Philly and headed down the road to check this place out.  Not very assuming on the outside, I will say.  The inside is pretty east coast...In a totally good way.    Not the kind of place you get fawned over it seems (unless you're a regular) but the customer service was certainly nice, and I got the food rather quick.    I tried the cheese steak with red sauce.  It was awesome!  It ain't the cheapest I've ever gotten but it was worth the trip.  I suspect that I will be back!

I've had some  very minor issues here, but the customer service was top notch and the prices are very decent in most cases.

Honestly, their head pharmacist helped save me money after finding out my new prescription benefit had skyrocketed my co-pays compared to my old benefit.  I suspect I might have saved a bit more at one of the big box places but the customer service here is awesome!

The front staff and nursing staff is amiable enough.  The doctor I dealt with was also was pleasant enough, however he did seem to be more concerned with his reputation in the medical community or with getting a requested treatment denied by the insurance company rather than fixing my back injury.    They're nice enough generally speaking that I'd hoped to give them a good review but when I see a doctor I expect results....Or at least a viable plan of action that will treat both the short and long term issues.  Initially this was the case but they fizzled out short in my case so far and they do not seem willing to change their minds at this point.

I've always enjoyed the atmosphere here.  It's decor feels like a pub to me.  I've only been here a few times but the staff has been nice every time.  No complaints so far on my end.....  One of these days I may actually get around to looking at the menu for food.

My dad and I frequent this place often when we have lunch together.  The staff has been unfailingly nice, the prices are mid-range but the quality is great.  The lunch / happy hour specials rock socks.

Beautiful setting with gardens and fountains. The library, arts center, and lots of food places on the area. I also love the Native American Trails series they're doing here Thursdays and Saturdays for the next month or two.

This practice started off great.  I'd thought I found a perfect doctor.  One who seemed in sync with what I felt and needed.  However over the next couple of years, I noticed a few things go south.  Lab results started to take longer to get back.  1 or 2 days became 3-6.  Medical paperwork went from a no problem attitude and filled out as needed to having to argue for it and details being way off what was discussed.    The last medications I requested had 1 medication at 1/2 the stength and the other 2X the strengths I needed.  These were prescriptions that had been prescibed before.    The doctor in question ended coming across as flakish and obstinant by the time I left the practice.  I don't often do negative reviews like this, but I've rarely had this poor of an experience and I seem to be not alone.  I had the same Doctor as one of the other poor reviews here it seems.

My first time here was in April.  It was quiet, the staff was nice, the drink selection was fair and the good was rather good.  I went back after the 1st of May, where I found out the place was under new management.  I've tried more things on the menu and rarely have yet to be dissapointed.  Their wings are quite good.  They have a bacon and cheese crisp with mild chilli which is really good.  The sliders and burgers are a must for fans of each I think.    They've had a few nights where they were a bit light on the wait staff, which they did apologize for and they've been quite friendly every time I have been there.  Between that factored with the good food and decent drink offerings, I think they've found a new regular.

Nice little bar with fair prices, cool staff and great Irish nachos. Tulley due is also available plus Guinness is on tap like any good Irish pub.   Also, I'd like to give a shout out to Tracy who is a great bar tender.

I first found this place by driving by maybe a year and a half ago on some other errand.  I'll be honest.  I have NEVER gotten a pizza from here before.    However the stromboli's and calzones have crossed my doorstep many times.  They are VERY enjoyable, filling and not too badly priced.  $8-12 will get you a small, medium or large stromboli or calzone recipe that they have on the menu.  Build your own may cost a bit different, however.  I wont say they're the best I have ever had, but they are tasty.   The tasty food and the pricing would have been a border 3-4 but the good customer service sold me on a 4th star.  They even deliver!

I've been ordering from this store for a while.  Today I figured I'd give em another shot.  Their customer service was good.  The order took a while, but was within their estimated time so I don't mind so much.  However I will say that for the first time I felt let down by the food.  The Calzone was bigger than I expected (I wonder if they gave me a large rather than a medium, which would explain the cost being higher than anticipated) but it seemed all crust and salami.  I hardly noticed any other meats, the veggies were lighter than usual and the cheese was hardly noticeable.  I called them up to let them know and, regretfully, there was no member of management available which was disappointing.  I was promised a callback and we'll see what they have to say.  Not sure I want to order something different all things considered (to be honest, I'd be pleased with a partial refund or something).  Days later they never called me back.  I was disappointed.  The calzone was really bad, which is new to them, and despite the promise of a callback, it never happened.  I'd have forgiven them if a supervisor called me back like promised but alas....  Bad experience, missed chance to make it up...Will I go back?  Maybe but it may not be for a while.

I moved back to the area about 10 months ago after living elsewhere in the valley for a number of years.  Last time I was in this area this used to be the Waterfront Grill which turned into a Chandler bar pretending to be a Scottsdale bar.  I've been here more than once since I been back as it's easily within walking distance of my home.  The food is okay bar food.  It ain't the best nor the worst.  I think a lot of the food is a bit pricier than I'd expect.  They have decent selections of beer and booze, though I have seen bigger selections and much better drink specials elsewhere.  Business depends on day, time of year, time of day etc.  It can be between pretty dead and pretty busy as has been mentioned before.   The bar staff can be really hit or miss as well.  Finally, Nate's is a Boston themed bar.  Normally it's not a big problem.  I've been to other themed bars around town.  I've seen staff get downright ornery toward customers who happened to be rooting for their home team when they happened to be playing a Boston team.   If the fan starts a fight, that is one thing but that hasn't always been the case which is a big downer for this place.  I've finally decided to stop blowing my money here.  It's really not worth it anymore.  I can get comparative or better food elsewhere and kill brain cells cheaper. There are reasons why this place is getting a lot of 1 or 2 star ratings.  I think I've explained mine.

Nice staff and good location for me.  With that being said there are lines more often than not due to being not being appropriately staffed (8-10 deep and only one teller isn't uncommon).    I come here for the convenient location and nice staff but only when I have a lot of time to dedicate to whatever transactions I need.

I've ordered delivery from this location a few times in the past 6 months.  The food has always been rather good if not very good and I've routinely been able to get a generous amount of food for $14 delivered with tax and tip.  It sometimes takes a bit to get the food, but it's always been reasonable and the staff, despite occasional communication issues, have generally be very nice.   If you've got a bit of cash in your pocket and like good chinese food, I'd recommend this place.

I've only been to Maui Dog once, but I loved the visit!  The food was so deliciously original!    A few buddies and I were in the area and my friend Paul said that we HAD to go there.  I mooched in with my 2 friends and we ordered some food.  It was one of the most unique hotdog / sausage flavors I've ever had.    I was looking forward to a return trip, but I am not sure I can make it back by the 29th.   The news of the closure of this delicious joint makes me very sad.  If you have not been here and can make it there, I'd recommend making at least one visit before it's too late.

Food's always been good, the service and speed is a bit more hit and miss than I am used to even for Taco Bell.   Also not pleased with the grillers being priced above a buck now.  I liked em at 99 cents!

One of the better bars in the Valley.  Great food and drink specials, good selection of drinks, the owners & staff are awesome and good live music.  If you live in the area, this place is pretty much a must if you like the bar and grill type place with just about everything.  I loved going here when I lived in the area.

Good food for a fast food joint.  The staff is usually very cool (I'll admit to having a bit of a crush on one of them), the prices aren't the cheapest out there but the quality is generally good, and the daily $1 deal usually rocks.    Add to that the free salsa bar with assorted goodies....I've rarely been let down.

Fast food is rarely going to be epic.  Tonight was my first time eating there in a LONG time.  The staff was nice.  7 bucks for 2 entrees and some spring rolls was a pretty good deal.  The spicy chicken was overall good.  Overall the batter was crispy, though a few pieces were not.  The spring rolls were mediocre.  They were not the worst I've ever had, but I've had better.  The lo mien tasted doey like it wasn't all the way cooked or something.    To be honest, there are better places out there, but if you're in a pinch and hankering for chinese it's better than nothing.  The chicken and the service saved what otherwise would have been a 1 * rating.

What is there to tell?  It's pretty much a flea market.  Some of the vendors were playing up their wares while others were quieter however all were pretty nice.   There were some very cool items to be had it seemed.  Some were mere trinkets, some were pretty good quality...It depended on the vendor as you might expect.    It's not the biggest place I've ever seen and I'd not argue with seeing more vendors but all in all, I'd say it's worth swinging into.  There might be a trinket or treasure waiting for you there.  I personally felt like a kid in a candy store.

I just ordered from them again.  The person who took my order was fast, prompt and very nice.  One of the best order takers I have experienced in some time.    The order arrived quicker than I expected, which is a bonus.  The delivery person was a beautiful and charming woman who smiled and was also nice.  4/5!

Got a #5 from them tonight after a busy day with a soda.  The order taker was very kind and efficient.  I had to repeat myself a few times but I think that was due to a bad connection.  The driver was very nice (and I will admit rather cute).  The sandwich was delicious.  She forgot the drink, but I called the store and they sent out the driver with it a few moments later along with a treat to make up for the inconvenience.    The crew and food was great, the honest mistake was made up for by a great act of customer service.  I would recommend this location to anyone in the area that enjoys great subs and great service.

Visited the store for the first time rather than delivery.  Staff was awesome, as usual, and the lass taking my order recognized me from a delivery a while back!    The subs are still yummy, they were fast and am pleased with their customer service,   Decided to finally give in and give them the 5 stars they have earned from me!

The staff is generally nice and seem knowledgable.  The location is pretty convenient too.    The two stars are due to a uniformly long wait time.  I've never gotten out if here in less than an hour and, in fact, over 2 hours start to finish has been my usual experience.   This has been my main deterrent.

I recently started working with Mark, who is based at the Scottsdale location.  He is one of the most knowledgeable therapists I have worked with.  He is also personable and empathetic not to mention very nice to work with.  The rest of the staff is also rather awesome to deal with.  Hurt?  Well, after you talk to a doctor, I would personally suggest you talk to these folks.  There is also a Goodyear office too, and though I have not been, they're likely just as good.    Not often I offer 5 stars, but 5/5.

I am not sure why people are saying the decore was so bad.  I'm guessing improvements have made since my visit and those reviews as the decoration was very decent.  the prices were there, the service was nice, and the sushi quality was definitely better than the other conveyor style sushi joint I frequented before.  the only 2 things I would fuss about are the fact special Orders are not brought on color coded plates making it harder to track your spending and that they have two conveyor belts rather then a longer 1.    overall, I would recommend this place for a good, inexpensive and casual sushi experience.

Round 2.  Had a bit of birthday gift money to spend and I have dealt with a bit of a headache today so I figured I'd pamper myself.  Seksun has a very comfortable and nice decor these days.    Good food, good staff. (Note:  This review was from October, but forgot to complete it.)

First time here this week.  There was a little confusion on my part regarding parking and they refused to validate the parking ticket so I ended up having to pay $12 for it, which is hard for me given my current financial situation.    I was also rather eager to be selected for a jury as I have never been on a jury before even after having been registered to vote since I was 18 and having a valid drivers license before.    This is the 6th time I have been summoned by an Arizona court.  3 of them got dismissed before I had to go in, twice (including this time) I pretty much just sat in the waiting room until they dismissed us, and only once I made it to jury selection but I was one of those dismissed.  I found that a bit disappointing though I realize it's really not anyone's fault.  It'd be nice if they had something entertaining on TV and sound like they do in the Pima County Court system...Last time I was called in I got to watch 50 First Dates which was amusing and helped make the time fly by a bit faster and lessened the blow of having to sit around all day.

Well, as most who follow me know I don't often pull punches.  I will flat out say if a place is good for feeding your face or if it's a place that you aught to NOT show your face at.    The Pig and Pickle has a casual atmosphere with a splash of the artistic.  The staff was awesome!  They were attentive, friendly and outgoing.  The pork shoulder tostadas were wonderful with a uniquely delicious flavor.  The tot of the day was spectacular as well.    If you want to try something new that is likely going to taste great?  Check out the Pub on the northwest corner of Hayden and Thomas.  5 Stars!

Awesomesauce as they say.  Flavor adventures on a whole new level.  Creative recipes with old style tricks.  Add a great staff and awesome drinks to the mix.      If you enjoy food, this is a must go for at least one time.  Chances are you'll be back for more.

Most people over the age of 21 have had some sort of sexual experience.  By themselves, with someone else....Whatever.  The reason I mention this is that the food here has been so good in my experience, my taste buds have exploded with extacy.  The pork shoulder tostadas, the almost fist sized appetizers labeled as tots that are wrapped in potato and have such wonderful, ever changing goodies that taste so good.    The menu items and Facebook hidden finds that are so delicious that you almost want to BEG for more.  Add yummy beers and drinks, wonderful staff, this place is a foodies wet dream.    Perverse perhaps, but all too true.  If you LOVE food, you will live and die by this place.  No joke.  It is THAT good.  If I won the lottery I'd be here daily.  As a mook down on his luck, once in a blue moon is a dream come true.    Cheers!  Have a meal here and tell em Trunker sent you.  They may be kind.

I started off happy with my doctor there.  He rotated out when he  graduated his internship and I was assigned a new intern.  This new doctor was not bad to start with but started changing my prescriptions despite having had a number of previous experienced doctors finding the use of these medicines.  Talking to anyone is impossible.

This location is the department that manages unemployment, food stamps and healthcare.  I went from 42nd in line to 30 something in the span of 3 hours.  I had to leave due to other appointments with no resolution to my reason for being there.  Last time I was here was for my food stamps application and I was there for over 6 hours between waiting and the interview.  The staff was busting their humps trying to get things done, I know.  Unfortunately they seem to be understaffed for their demand these days.  It's a bad economy, the job market sucks and I'm more miffed at the state HR department for not staffing the office with the apparently necessary staff than the actual staff.    Regardless of who's fault it was, I cannot give this location a good review due to the lack of efficiency.

Nice set up, generally cool staff, decent selection of drinks...haven't gone beyond the pretzles though food wise.  The prices are old town Snottsdale style but the people are what make it into Scottsdale classy but chill.   If they were like my usual haunt price wise, I might be  more regular.

Okay, I've been a repeat costumer for a while now though I've slowed down some due to finances and taking a break as I realized recently I alcohol has me most times I have it.  Regardless, I went in for some yummy IPA pints and to chill in the nice atmosphere.    I decided to get a bit of grub and wanted to get the pretzel with cheese but they were out of the latter according to the server I asked.  I let myself get talked into the poppers.  While not bad they were WAY too hot for my tastes.  When someone else offered me the pretzel I went for it thinking that maybe this other server knew something the previous fellow didn't.  Hummus and pretzels aren't horrid but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  When I expressed my displeasure the staff made sure I was taken care of which is one of the reasons why when I hit old town I keep coming back here.

Cool staff, never had a hooka before which makes this place a novel set up.  Very cool staff.  Only had the chance to check it out rather than hang but when I have a bit more to spend I aim to swing back here.  I rather miss the Toasted Cork however this could be a funky place to be.
