I would never visit this location again. The food was so bland and the girl working and manager are both very rude and dont understand the meaning of customer service. AT ALL. You want good food? Great customer service and a wider selection of sushi?? Go to the one off of Scottsdale Rd and Osborn in Scottsdale

DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!! My fiance, our friend and I went here because they were hungry. When we returned home, my fiance opened his burrito to put hot sauce in and a cockroach crawled out of it! It was disgusting.  When we took the food back for a refund, the girl at the counter acted as if it wasnt a surprise at all, like it was normal to have bugs crawl out of their food. No problems with a return, however, but I wouldnt eat here if you paid me!

I am very disappointed with the service I received at the Indian School location in Phoenix.  After waiting for a half an hour,  I was finally told that there was a problem verifying my insurance, which I called and did myself with no problem. So after I was able to do the Nationwide employees job, I was told I would have to wait, because they had to take other people ahead of me, when I was here long before them and I had an appointment FIRST or reschedule and come back another day. This is ridiculous.  Unacceptable.  Thank you for wasting 2 hours of my Saturday.

we visited on april 15th and And also Sunday April 22.. I have twice now gone to your restaurant and twice been told that I couldnt use my BOGO coupon. The first time my mother went to pick up our order, she was told we didnt order the right food and we had to order off the main entress. The second time we ordered, I was told that we had to order off of the DINER SELECT menu. I did not have my coupon handy, and when I was able to read it, it says specifically, "Offer valid for one complimentary Diner Select with the purchase of another entree. Complimentary Diner Select must be of equal or lesser value to purchase entree. Valid entrees include SIGNATURE DISHES, BOWLS, SALADS, DINER SELECTS AND LETTUCE WRAPS." So why, on two separate occasions were we told conflicting information and not allowed to use the coupon, thus spending a small fortune on food, TWICE?!?!? Your customer service is far from what it used to be and I doubt you will be getting more of our business any time in the near future.

I really used to love this office, not sure what has happened in the last couple years but I can't say I feel the same way anymore.

This actually used to be one of my favorite restaurants until I got pretty nasty food poisoning this last weekend thanks to cold food that I should have sent back. I tried to reach out to the restaurant, and have yet to hear back. Very disappointing!

Happy with my car, but got lots of empty promises. Still haven't received my referral bonus  (my mom got a car after I did because she liked mine so much), or anything else that I was supposed to get. No one ever follows up like they are supposed to, and they kept my moms cds and no one ever called back regarding that either. Just kinda ridiculous.

They are actually on Hayden and Thomas now FYI. But love this office! Dr Kennedy is one of the kindest, most amazing doctors there is and his office staff is fabulous! They always take good care of me and my family! And you can't forget Meha.... Dr Kennedy's dog. She's a sweet little thing and loves her patients too!

I went with two co-workers here yesterday for lunch, and they gave me the wrong sandwich. I took it back to them and asked for the right food ( I HATE and cannot eat mayo, especially when it has like half of a bottle on it). They "remade" my sandwich and handed me back a "corrected' chicken ranch blt... Well, when I sat down to enjoy my lunch, i realized it was the same one... They actually wiped off some of the mayo and covered it up with ranch. There was still mayo all over the bun and in the box. I have reported them to the health dept. That is so against the law!

This is an amazing shop. The smells are warm and inviting when you first walk in, the customer service is always A++++, and I love their products! Can't live without my patchouli oil! You can make your own scents by mixing different flavors and its just an awesome little shop! Definitely highly recommended!

I came here to check out a specific shoe, with my back and knee problems I'm researching and trying to find a perfect fit that will help with my issues.... This place was amazing! The customer service was outstanding and I'm really excited to go back after pay day and get my new shoes! Ciara helped me and she was super awesome! Love this place & the shoe dog thingy was pretty fantabulous!

Can I just say that I am in love? Absolutely love the atmosphere of the shop, not a typical pretentious salon where people turn their nose up at you if you don't fit the typical clientele. Definitely get the feel that anyone is welcome and that was nice. Now on to the hair... Paul cut my hair and did an AMAZING job! I absolutely love the cut and will be coming back. I started here due to some unfortunate circumstances that have made getting in with my usual stylist next to impossible and as a result have found a new home. Am absolutely thrilled with this place, would absolutely recommend it and will most definitely be returning!

We ordered from here for the very first time and it was the worst experience EVER! Had our food delivered, and our order was messed up (last I checked, that was THEIR bad), I was told that if I wanted it corrected, I would have to bring it back, they wouldn't re-deliver!!! Never, EVER going here again. Oh, best part? I asked if I could talk to a manager and was told to call back tomorrow. Superbowl Sunday at a delivery burger place and no manager?!? Wow!

Of all the Nationwide Vision Centers that I have been to, this one by far is the best. I have always been treated very well here compared to other locations. I had quit going to nationwide for vision needs because of horrible service and decided to try this location, and I am so happy that I did!

This is by far the best treatment I have had at a nail salon ever. Money well spent for sure!
