Stopped by to have new tires installed on my SUV....Planning a road trip the end of the month and wanted to make sure that my tires are in good shape..Made appointment online, no problem, showed up this afternoon for my appointment. Met with Donald Haywood to start my transaction to install 4 new tires on my SUV, Don went out and checked my tires...He advised me I would love to sell you new tires but honestly you are good you can go for another 10k miles and a couple of rotations before you need new tires....It's good to find salespeople that are honest about their job and not take advantage of you just to make the sale...I went to a different store a while back to have a nail removed from my tire and the salespeople advised me that I needed new tires then...Kudo's to Donald Hawyood for his honesty...

Spotted this place a few weeks back while driving down 7th St.....Last night we thought we would check it out...  The overall look of the place reminds me of Chipolte....

This place has amazing donuts....I brought in donuts for a team meeting at work, everyone loved the donuts and asked me to bring them again for day 2 of the meeting...The staff there is great to work with I think they now know me by name which is a good thing...I will be back again to get more donuts...

There are better pizza places than 414. In this day and age with various food allergies you would think they would have more options like gluten free, but they don't. Also I thought it was pretty tacky that their delivery person slices the pie in the middle of the restaurant. They get a C for effort on service. Don't think I'll be back
