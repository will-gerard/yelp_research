best cosmetic dentist in the valley by far, specializing in bleaching, veneers, bonding but also does routine cleaning and X-rays. she is very passionate, talented and truly cares about her patients. if you ever have an issue or an emergency she always makes time for you. very cool upbeat office and nice people.

My daughter had allot of issues here during her freshman year, drugs, sneaking off campus, et There was zero resources for help, including when I tried to get involved.  Save yourself 25K a year and send your kid to a newer legit school, your just paying for the name, the school has very mixed reviews.

I exercise allot so The Drip Room is great for getting a solid recharge of fluids and vitamins. the staff couldn't be nicer, the environment and process is very professional and well run. it is also the absolute best place to erase a bad hangover !
