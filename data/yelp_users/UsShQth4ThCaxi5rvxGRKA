I love Martin's Auto Repair!!!  I originally went to Martin's when I first moved to Phoenix and my car was overheating non-stop in the summer. I made the mistake of going to the dealership first (I have a Nissan Xterra) and was quoted an outrageous price of $4000+ to not only fix the overheating problem but to fix everything else wrong with my car. Considering my car is 10 years old and only worth about $4000, I was in quite a bit of a pickle. Then, my step dad recommended I look at Garagefly.com and find a trusted auto repair shop. I found Martins and went with them because everyone rated them 5/5 and there wasn't a single bad review.   I took in my car and told them about my experience at the dealership (which was ABC Nissan, by the way!) and after doing a thorough inspection of my car, they were able to fix the problem for less than $350!!! They also gave me a report of everything else they found and gave me a timeline on when the repairs should be done. Now I go to Martin's for my oil changes and usually check an item off my "needs to be done" list while my car is there.  The staff is super friendly and they get you in and out quickly. Couldn't have better things to say about them. They literally saved me thousands of dollars!!!

Absolute Heaven.  My husband and I decided on a stay-cation for our two year wedding anniversary and decided to stay at The Royal Palms based on reviews and the curb appeal of this beautiful resort. It looks similar to our wedding venue and we got an amazing deal (they price matched a "budget" travel website that I was skeptical of). When we made the hotel reservation, we also made reservations for the restaurant, T. Cooks and they asked if we were celebrating anything special.  Upon checking in, our hotel key holder stated our name and "Happy Anniversary"  and they upgraded us to a suite as a present! Very nice. The bellman showed us to our room, which was beautiful. We immediately got changed into our swim suits and checked out the pool. It is small but is fine for the size of the resort. We ordered mojitos poolside and had a great afternoon!  After getting ready for dinner, we walked the grounds before our reservation. The resort is nestled up right against Camelback and there are lots of courtyards and hidden gems around the property. We went to the bar for happy hour (great happy hour deals) and then went to T. Cooks for dinner. Our table had rose petals and candles and our menu said Happy Anniversary on it! Our meal was fabulous and when it came time for dessert, they brought over their special for the evening and in chocolate writing, it said Happy Anniversary! We truly felt like we were being treated like royalty! When we got back to the room, our bed had been turned down and there was a platter of fruit and chocolates and it also had the chocolate writing that said Happy Anniversary on it! Wow! This is the place to go if you are celebrating!   This resort is amazing. The hotel is gorgeous, the grounds are beautiful and you will be treated like you are the only two people in the world! Thank you and we will be back!

ehhhhhhh... I really wanted to like this place...but I left unimpressed.  My co worker recommended this place after a few good experiences. I am also crazy about reading reviews online and overall, this place has good reviews so I gave it a shot.   The shop was in good condition and I really liked that they took their tools out of a sanitized bag. Knowing your tools have been cleaned well is a big plus.  I got a shellac manicure and the younger girl that did my manicure was nice and thorough, however, she put WAY too much polish on. My past shellac manicures have lasted 2-3 weeks but mine started to lift off my nails within 5 days. I am thinking I just got the wrong gal for the job but I think I am going to be sticking with Desert Nail Spa.   $25 for a shellac manicure.

We went to Mary Coyle's for ice cream last night and holy cow...this place looks SOOOOO much better than it did before. I couldn't believe it! The menu still looks to be the same but isn't all torn up and written over like before. The decor is super cute---stripped pink and white walls with black accents. The waitstaff is dressed straight out of a 50's diner. Ice cream still delicious! I wish they would of done something different to the outside when they changed owners because the lattice on the outside looks uninviting but I promise it is worth going into!

Hands down, best pancakes I have ever had. I would wait three hours for those babies! Went on a Sunday, waited almost 2 hours and boy was it worth it. I would suggest going on a weekday early morning to avoid the wait but I promise you will be glad you waited! You can also do take out. Oh, and get the orange juice!

I love this place!  I have been several times and each time I have been impressed. I got sandwhiches the first few times I went and the other day I went for breakfast and got a few pastries. I haven't been for their "Desert Nights" yet, but I have had one of their cupcakes and a brownie and both were delicious!   My only complaint is their sandwhich hours. I have been at least three times (either after 2pm or on Sundays) hoping for one of their sandwhiches and they are not being served. I just think it is a little silly that they only serve their sandwhiches for three or four hours out of the entire day (and not at all on Sundays).

Completely unprofessional.   I arrived early and waited over 30 minutes for my appointment. After finally being called, I was asked to make a urine sample for my appointment. I went into the bathroom to find several used cups that had not been picked up in quite some time. Dirty.  My physician, Ilona Bleaman, was very nice and welcoming, but seemed to be in a big rush. Not sure if they overbooked or what but I sensed she was in a hurry.  Upon leaving, I was asked when would be best to schedule my follow up appointment. I was super confused as any doctor I have gone to in the past called with results. I asked if it was possible to get the results over the phone and they said no. You have to pay another co-pay to get your results!!! I reluctantly made the appointment but after talking to a lot of friends and family about how they always get their results via phone call, I called and cancelled. I was finally able to get them over the phone after saying that the law gives me the right to my medical results.  In addition, I recently received a bill for my blood tests. One of the five things tested was not covered by my insurance so I called to find out what the test was for. While the lady on the phone was very nice, she told me that she didn't know for sure but from what she could see in the system, I was in for a routine well woman exam and gout. UMMMM...excuse me? Gout? First off, I didn't even know what it was! After she explained it to me, I was utterly confused on why that was even in my file. I never have, and currently do not have any symptoms what so ever of gout.  This place is so unprofessional on a number of levels. Unfortunately, I did not do any further research online about this office and went off a co-workers recommendation. There are terrible reviews all over the internet about this place.

Found this place on restaurant.com. You can get a $25 gift card for $10 bucks!   My hubby and I really enjoyed ourselves. It does not look like much from the outside but the patio is so cute!!! You really feel like you have a little piece of New York in Phoenix.    We got the bruchetta which was very good. My husband got a seafood special which was loaded with all different kinds of shellfish. I had the pizza and while it was good, I would suggest getting a pasta dish. All of the pastas looked amazing and the pizza looked reminiscent of a frozen pizza.

After seeing a segment on Maizie's on the news one morning I had to check this place out and I must say I was very impressed. They have a pretty extensive menu and I had a blood orange cocktail that was to die for. I had a chicken dish while my hubby enjoyed the surf and turf special. Great deal for the money...I was surprised at the meals you can get for $12-$15 a plate. We shared the Half Baked cookie for desert....yummy!   The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 was because the parking is kinda screwy.

YUMMO!  After months of wanting to go here, we finally went! I love Fox restaurants and this is one I was dying to try!  After seeing many reviews about the retail therapy cocktail, I just had to get it. Very good. They had a great wine selection too.   We started out with Oysters and the Beet Salad. Both were great.  Next came the shrimp and tortellini dish while my husband had a steak and potato puree. I loved my pasta dish....it was smaller than I expected but filling. The steak was cooked perfectly and very tender. The potato puree was just that, puree. My husband and I like thick potatoes with lots of lumps and this was pretty much the exact opposite. They were good...just not our thing.  We finished by sharing the peanut butter cup dessert. Divine.  Overall, we were very very pleased with Modern Steak. The decor is amazing, the food and service were wonderful and it was a great place for a date night. You really don't realize you are in a mall. It is a bit pricey (easy to spend $125+ for two) but worth it!

Based on the excellent yelp reviews, I gave Mark Garcia a call when one of the original windows to our home (1950's) shattered. Mark wasn't able to make it out that day which was a bummer, however, because of the reviews on here, I knew he would be worth the wait. He came out first thing the next AM and took care of our window. In fact, his prices were so fair that we had him replace another window with a crack in it. Both windows were tedious...Mark literally had to chisel the glass out of our old fashioned windows and he did it all while humming along to his music...happy as can be!

Had a wonderful massage today with Sarah Catherine. I would highly recommend her!  My mom gave me a Groupon for a 1 hour massage for my birthday and I used it today. Booking was super easy and you can do it through their website. The building doesn't scream amazingness from the outside but it is nicely decorated on the inside.My massage was great and relaxing and although it is quite a trek from my house, I will be returning. If you are a Groupon customer, you get to come back for another massage for $25 if it is booked within 2 weeks and $35 if you book it within 4 weeks. Pretty snazzy deal if you ask me!  Oh, and their website has a new url:  http://www.massage-therapy-spa.com/

I went to Downtown Phoenix Dental for the first time today and I am now kicking myself for not leaving my prior dentist earlier!   I was never afraid of the dentist when I was younger but after going to my last dentist for 3+ years, I lost a lot of confidence in my teeth/gums and always felt like I was going to have to get a lot of work done every 6 months. After my last appointment with my prior dentist, I knew I needed to find a honest dentist and unfortunately that is something hard to come about now a days. After doing a lot of research online, I came across Dr. Berschler and Downtown Phoenix Dental.   Dr. Berschler and his staff are great. I immediately felt welcome and appreciated the fact that it is a smaller office and you really feel like your thoughts and concerns about your teeth are really valued. My cleaning went well and Melissa, the dental hygienist, was very nice and did a good thorough job. She complimented my teeth and told me she could tell I took good care of my teeth. A appreciated the boost in confidence! Actually, the only issues she found in my mouth were two fillings done by my prior dentist that were kinda jagged/sloppy (my words...not hers!)  As soon as Dr. Berschler came over, he let me know my xrays looked good (happy dance for no cavities!) and asked if I had any areas of concern. I had a root canal about a year ago that still hurt occasionally and after describing what I was feeling and when I felt it, he quickly took me over to another chair and fixed the issue in less than one minute. WOW! Instant relief and no charge.   Can't say enough good things about my visit today----I will be recommending him to everyone I know!!!

SO my hubby and I were in search of a good burger on Saturday evening and wanted to go somewhere we have never been. SO...our search began. We narrowed our choices down to Delux and The Grind. Delux is closer, so we went there first only to be put on a wait list. HMMM...we thought....maybe this is a sign? So we headed over to The Grind.   We have never eaten at Delux before, but upon entering The Grind, we liked the atmosphere better. You wouldn't guess it from the outside but the inside is awesome and intimate. Delux seemed to scrunched for me, but again, never eaten there!   I got the BLT burger while my husband opted for the popular Sweet and Sour. We split fries. My mouth literally dropped when our burgers were delivered. I must say I am super confused at a previous post that noted smaller portions. I literally had to stare at the burger for 30+ seconds to figure out how to eat it! Do I cut it? NAH, just dig in. It was HUGE! My husband liked the Sweet and Sour a lot (he loves spicy things) but said I wouldn't be able to handle the spicy-ness. Fries were perfect to share....just a tad bit too much salt.   I really wanted to try the doughnuts but we were both so full! Next time!

My husband and I went to Gasper's last night for dinner. We found another coupon on restaurant.com ($10 for a $25 gift card).  Food was delicious! We split a salad, pasta and pizza and we both really impressed with the food, the service and the atmosphere. We will be going back!

This review is only based on the bar area/happy hour. Although this review is negative, I will defiantly be returning for bowling which I know will be an awesome experience.  So my hubby and I went yesterday afternoon (A Saturday) to check out happy hour. I had read on their website that they do Happy Hour everyday of the week from 4-7 with drink specials and some 1/2 priced menu items. The decor is amazing and we love how you can watch the lanes while hanging out in the bar. We sat down and as soon as the waitress saw us, I picked up the menu and asked "Is this the happy hour menu?" And she said "Yes, it is all 1/2 priced" Perfect. My husband and I both got a well mixed drink. It was fine. However, our bartender/waitress was throwing off a weird vibe (I don't know how to explain it, but she made us feel uncomfortable and barely said a word to us) so we decided to just have the one drink and leave. We paid and after exiting, we saw the sign that had their happy hour specials listed which said $3 well drinks. We both got well drinks but were charged $5 for each drink. I understand that we sat down about 8 minutes before 4pm that day but after remembering that the first thing I asked the bartender was about their happy hour specials, you would assume you would get happy hour prices or she would tell you that she would have to wait until after 4pm to honor the prices if their pos system worked that way. I know it is only $4 but I think it is just common courtesy to say something.

Went last night (9-17-11) for my first time and can't stop thinking about how impressed I am with both the service and the food.   A super cool concept, atmosphere and menu. Our waiter (Kevin, who is actually one of the 3 owners) was awesome and extremely personable. He suggested the redberry rapture for a drink and it was spectacular (and under 100 calories!) We got to talking about vodka and he spoke of a brand I had never heard before and within minutes, he brought both my hubby and I a sample of the vodka he was talking about. The gesture was great and so was the vodka!   We started with the pretzel bread. delish...especially the tomato dipping jam! I had the buffalo chicken wrap and my hubby got a 1/2 of the loaded Mac and Cheese. The buffalo wrap was really good and the Mac and Cheese was hands down the best I have ever had! I am not a big meat fan so I would probably get it "naked" next time but holy cow was it good! A 1/2 order is fine for an average sized meal.   All in all, amazing experience. I loved the concept of "owners at your service"....the three owners were the waiters from 7-9pm and all of their tips went to charity. Awesome. I will be back!

After weeks of going back and forth, back and forth and checking tons of reviews, we decided to go check out the Arrogant Butcher ourselves. The reviews on here (Yelp!) were kinda all over the place so we weren't sure what to expect. Any-who, we came to the conclusion that:   1. The decor is pretty darn awesome.  2. The waitstaff was good. The place was fully staffed and timing on everything was good.  3. Reservations may not be such a bad idea. We made one at six and it was pretty dead in there when we arrived. However, by the time we left around 7:15, it was full. We went on a Saturday (no games of any sort going on downtown either).  4. WAY overpriced. Our breakdown: 3 cocktails, an appetizer, 3 mussels...$1 a pop, an entree (we split it) and 2 desserts = $100 without tip.  5. Filet was not worth it. At $29 bucks, you would expect something much more. It was overcooked and while the menu made it sound like it came with potatoes, it was more or less a small amount of pureed/creamed potatoes.  6. Drinks, appetizers and desserts were all awesome.     Final thought: We will be back....but for drinks and appetizers during happy hour which runs from 3-6 Mon-Sat (they are closed Sundays).

Absolutely delectable!!!  My husband and I absolutely love Postino so when we saw that the owners were opening 2 new concepts, Windsor and Churn, we were pretty excited. We live about a mile away so we have been driving by just waiting for opening day! We went for ice cream at Churn tonight and are planning on checking out Windsor soon.  The decor inside Churn is super cute...think old soda fountain decor. There are approx. 12 different flavors which they make daily. They also have coffee and lots of yummy pastries, cookies, etc. I got a scoop of Butter Pecan with a red velvet cookie. The cookie was pretty good and the ice cream was amazing. It was so smooth and creamy! My hubby got one scoop of the peanut butter and another of the double chocolate. He enjoyed both.   There isn't inside seating but the weather is so amazing right now that the patio was just perfect. The parking is a little screwy....a few spots where you can self park but mostly valet. I felt kinda silly using valet to get ice cream! The staff was super friendly and helpful too! We will certainly be returning and would highly recommend Churn!

Officially our new hang out spot. We have been the last 3 Saturdays in a row! The atmosphere is great and we love the live music. Plus, 65+ beers on tap and great food! They also rotate the bands nicely...each Saturday (out of the last 3) they have had a different band. The one last night was great...never seen a lead singer play the drums before!

Went last night before the D-Backs game. It was packed but very well staffed. By looking at some of the older reviews, I think the place likely got the hint that they need to better staff themselves. Love the Pear Cider beer. Got the Irish Nachos...they were pretty good. Atmosphere is defiantly similar to a Hooter's.

Very good.   I had the tri-tip sandwich on whole wheat while my husband got the double Charburger. We both really enjoyed our meals. For both sandwiches, 1 order of fries, 1 drink and 1 milk shake it came to $17. It was pretty busy but everyone was working hard and kept a smile on their face. Nice Decor and it will be nice to enjoy the patio once it gets a bit cooler. My husband and I are big fans of Culver's so it will be tough to change our favorite fast food burger eatery but Habit came in at a close 2nd! Only complaint....it smelt really bad outside. I am guessing it was the dumpster but it was overwhelmingly smelly. Luckily, the smell of burgers and fries quickly filled the air!

I love Amey!  My doula, Kelly Sunshine (who is also awesome, by the way!) recommended I set up an appointment with Amey while I was still pregnant as many new mamas struggle with breastfeeding. It was actually the thing I was most nervous about (more than labor!) and Amey was so fantastic.  When Amey arrived (on time), I immediately felt a sense of relief. Breastfeeding had been going pretty well, but I was given conflicting information from the LC's at the hospital and was already cracking. I believe I saw Amey on my son's fourth or fifth day of life and after her visit, things improved and I was no longer in pain! YAY! She also weighs the babies pre-feed and post-feed and it was invaluable to know that he was getting food. Being a first time mom, I doubted myself often and I appreciated her reassurance.   Amey has continued to be a great resource over the last almost 9 months. She recommended our wonderful chiropractor (Dr. Becky) , who helped my son immensely after he was stuck in the birth canal for hours and had a super tight neck. She was also there when we decided to get our son's tongue and lip tie revised and it was absolutely wonderful to be able to go to her breastfeeding clinics post-revision.   I cannot thank Amey enough. She is beyond fabulous. I tell all my friends about her and cannot emphasize enough how she has helped our little family!

Hands down, one of the best venues in downtown Phoenix. Mark and Angela are absolutely wonderful to work with and the space itself is amazing. I have been to several different weddings here and each time it looks SO different. Angelic Grove/The Croft do an excellent job at making sure each event is specific to each client and in a world where a lot of weddings end up looking similar, it doesn't happen here. Highly recommended!

Years ago, Kristine took our photos for a "wear it again" photo shoot. Since then, she has taken our christmas, pregnancy announcement/gender reveal/maternity, newborn and family portraits. We have always been thrilled with our photos and receive many compliments.   Kristine is not only a talented photographer, but is great at making you feel comfortable so your photos don't look posed. Her turnaround time is quick and she is a pleasure to be around. I couldn't recommend Kristine enough!
