We visited Cafe Boa on Saturday night with a 7:30 reservation.  Long story short, we didn't leave until 9:30 and not by our choice.  It literally took 2 hours for our fairly simple pasta dishes to be delivered to the table.  Aside from that our salads arrived well before our appetizer.  It gets worse... There were 3 other 2 tops on the patio with us that all experienced the same service.  I witnessed a person from each of those tables literally get up to find the manager to complain.  Suspiciously, a 4 top sitting right next to us that was seated at the same time as us and received all of the items they ordered in a reasonable amount of time and in the correct sequence.  Someone at that table must have been very special for them to not experience what every other table around us did.  But wait, there's more... When the manager finally showed up at our table he apologized and explained there must have been an issue with taking too many reservations.  I completely understand that mistakes happen, but I expect that they will do the customary restaurant thing and make it right.  He offered us each a glass of wine, which was a step in the right direction, but that was not nearly enough.  When the bill arrived I was shocked that the food we waited 2 hours for remained on our bill.    Our experience was so disappointing on many levels.  This restaurant has a good reputation, really good food, and I've never heard anything bad about the service.  The food was fantastic but the service was really bad at every step of the way culminating with the lack of compensation for the ultimate reason we were not happy.  I wish I could recommend this place just for the food.  Maybe a take out would be the better option.

Officially on the rotation.  Excellent Korean BBQ. My wife had bi bim bop, she has never had that dish before and loved it. Service was quick and friendly. There appeared to be mostly a Korean clientele, which is a good sign when visiting a Korean restaurant. We will definitely be back.

What I keep finding at the higher end Fox restaurants is a lot of potential with a lack of execution.  I love Sauce, but this place and The Green House were a huge let down.   When a place has the word "Steak" in it's name, of course you are expecting an awesome steak. I ordered what should have been one of the best steaks on menu, 20oz bone-in Ribeye. It was really disappointing. Thin, tough, no way this was a Prime cut of steak.   Apps, sides, wine, service...all pretty good or this would have been a 1 star. Don't waste your money here, head across the street to City Hall.
