I've always been a huge Lovesac fan and give the product a million stars! The staff at this location was super friendly as well. Roy and Toni made me feel so comfortable in the store and even took time out to help me look up a black friday deal on the website to see if they could beat it in store. They definetly showed that they cared about me as a customer! I will definetly be coming back to this location time and time again!

Awful. Ive been trying to get my gas turned on but when I try signing up online I'm told there is an error with my account, call on the weekdays. I've been calling on every break from work that I can and get an automated message that says call volume is too high snd then disconnects my call. It wont even let me wait on hold! I need my gas turned on and this is the service available. Been calling since last week and still cannot even get ahold of a live person. Horrible horrible horrible.

The replacement of my old hot water heater went beautifully. The plumber was professional and personable. He informed me of some upgrades I could make (at + cost) which I said no to. I say this because they need to inform you of changes to the building codes. I have no complaints & would definitely use this plumbing service again.
