I chose Ah So for my birthday celebration after reading good reviews and good word of mouth. I was completely blown away! We had so much fun. We came at 7:30 on a Friday night and it was quiet and not busy. I like a quiet atmosphere so this was perfect for me. The waitress was welcoming and friendly. The chef was hilarious and fun! He got all of us involved in the Teppanyaki experience. Now to the food. The food was just as amazing. I normally don't like fried rice but this rice was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Everyone's food looked great. I just left, and I already want to go back! This place was awesome. Great experience!

I bought the $79 Groupon after my boyfriends cousin got her tint job done and I was impressed with her results. I went in yesterday to get my tint job done. The standard Groupon covers the lightest shade, there is a small charge to get a darker tint. In total, it cost me an additional $40 ($30 for the darker shade and $10 for the small side windows.) I was quoted a wait time of 3 hours but it only took about an hour an a half for the job to get done. While I was in the waiting room, an elderly man came in to inquire on an odd request. I overheard Leslie tell the man that they normally dont do this job since it required the film to be cut into a circle and they usually cut film in squares. Even though they dont typically do these jobs she offered to find a solution and help the man out. 10 minutes later she came out with the finished tint film for him. To me, this gesture spoke volumes. As to where a lot of business would have told the man that they couldnt help him, she went above and beyond to figure something out for him. This is what I call excellent customer service! As for the tint job itself, there are no bubbles in my car and I'm 1000% happy with the results.

I've been a loyal customer since the first location opened here in Arizona. I love the new dining addition they added! This location is always clean, everyone's very friendly and the food never ever disappoints! I wish they would open s location in San Tan Valley!

I went to this practice as a new patient today. I've been searching for a good doctor for a while with no luck but drove by this place and read the good reviews and decided to go in. I was blown away by this practice. It was nice and clean which is always great. The receptionist was nice. The MA was nice. I saw NP Joy Cole and she was amazing! Very personable and real. She asked me the right questions to get to know me and give me a clear diagnosis. She took her time and I didn't feel like an inconvenience at all. I had my hands full with a 2 year old and 11 month old. As I was leaving, Joy walked me all the way out and held the doors open (since I was holding a car seat). Most doctors I know just leave the room and send you on your way so this was just a very nice small gesture on her part that spoke volumes of her. I am extremely impressed and happy to have finally found a good practice.

My AC has been broken for a while and I was told by someone else that I needed a whole new AC compressor and quoted me about $700. I brought my car in to FAC and they diagnosed my car and in fact, I did need a new AC compressor. Matt was very professional and my parts came in a week. My car was ready in less than 3 hours with ice cold AC. There were no problems during my visit and I saved a ton of money coming here. I would definitely recommend FAC to anyone.

I'm not quite sure why others have such a terrible experience with JU. I've been here for a year now and have never had an issue with JU. The water is a little questionable at times (not often) but their customer service is amazing.  I've had to pay my bill late twice and they have always been helpful in setting up a payment extension for me. Today, I was due to be disconnected if I didn't make arrangements. I called them and it kept ringing busy so I messaged them on Facebook, and within an hour someone called me and helped me to give me an extension so that my water wasn't shut off. This is what I call great customer service.  So far, so good.

This is hands down the best indoor play area that I've found for my kids! The entire concept was well thought out and incorporated. The first thing I love about this place is that adults are free. Most places charge for adults and I end up feeling jipped since I'm not the one playing.   The second thing I love is the cafe. It's directly in front of the jungle gym, so you can easily enjoy your lunch and still keep an eye on your kids. They even keep a package of baby wipes at the counter for any sticky fingers! And the food was good and very reasonably priced.  The bathrooms are super clean and they have an actual wooden changing table, not one of those plastic ones that comes from the wall.   The entire staff was wonderful but I especially want to shout out Jessica for being extremely friendly and attentive to not only me, but everyone there. And also the older gentleman at the front counter (I didn't get his name unfortunately).   Amazing place! I wish they had one of these in the east valley because I would go very often.

I love coming to Angry Crab! Although there's always at least a 30 minute wait, I don't mind because the food is so delicious. Once you get seated, the service is pretty fast. Our food usually comes within 15 minutes. You can build your own bag with your choice of crab, mussels, clams, whatever you want, and to your desired spicy level. Market prices so it's really reasonable. They don't believe in plates or utensils so be prepared to get down and dirty!

I am an avid Dunkin Donuts fan and it's the only coffee place I go to. This location is 1 minute from my house and I was excited that it was so close. The first time I went in, there was garbage everywhere in the sitting area. No sight of any employee cleaning it up. I placed an order for 5 drinks. When my order came, none of the drinks were labeled so I asked the man which coffee was which. He took the lid off my cup and stuck his nose in it to try and guess. I was completely grossed out. My drink also tasted awful. Despite this bad experience, I decided to give it one more try to see if it was just a bad day. The same slob worker was there and my drink was just as bad. If you read Google reviews, there are people who talk about the same guy doing very unsanitary things to the utensils and drinks. Save yourself the possibility of infection and take the extra 10 minute drive to the Rittenhouse location, where everyone is super friendly and the coffee is great. I hope the franchise owner reads this so they can fire the awful employees who are going to end up getting this location shut down due to their negligence of sanitation.

So I have made 2 trips to this DD within the last week, and I must say that this location has turned it around and is a thousand times better. They hired new, professional workers! They are friendly and sanitary and make good coffee!

Going back to giving the place 1 star. I went to get coffee this morning and it's now sitting full on my counter because it's inedible. I went once and clearly stated no sugar, they dumped a gallon of sugar in my drink. I didn't notice until I got home, so I had to round up my kids for a second time to go return my drink. I asked AGAIN, no sugar and please light on the swirls. Coffee is again loaded with sugar. I even dumped milk in it myself to try to even it out but it still tastes way sugary. Wasted 2 trips and $1.50. How hard is it to make a good drink? It's coffee, not rocket science for Christ's sake. So annoyed.

I called Iron Mantis on Saturday 10/10 after finding spiders on the outside of my home. The guy I talked to on the phone was very nice and professional and he explained all of the policies and procedures. He got me scheduled a couple of days out. Jeremy, the technician came to my home and again explained exactly what he was going to do. The process was fast, easy, and I no longer have spiders on the exterior of my home. Very professional and friendly business.

I'm writing this review as I'm finishing my food. I ordered the 2 piece mild chicken with red beans and rice. Amazing! I am not a fan of fried chicken but this place is great! The beans were so good and the chicken fell right off the bone. The girl at the front (I forgot her name, sorry!) was super duper nice which is refreshing. Will definitely be coming back.

I used to always go to the Signal Butte location and loved it. The gods answered my prayers when I told them that there is no good pizza in Queen Creek/San Tan Valley and then Mod opened up and I died and went to heaven.   Even though, this is a subway type of chain (build your own) it definitely surpasses the expectation. The station is super clean and the pizza makers are friendly and super attentive. The owner did a good job of making sure everyone was 100% trained to make sure everything rolled smooth. And it did. I was not let down!   Great pizza at a great price! Definitely recommend. I'll be here atleast once a week.
