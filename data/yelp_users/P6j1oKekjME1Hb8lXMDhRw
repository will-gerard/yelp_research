I just got a puppy and the team over here is just great.  Very thorough, never a wait, and you can tell they love dogs!     Two paws up!

Came here for a couple of cocktails with a girlfriend around 4:15pm.  We sat outside on the patio.  There were MAYBE five occupied tables in the whole restaurant including ours, and probably 5 staff members setting up for the evening shift.    We got our first drink at around 4:20pm, didn't even get checked on until at least 25 minutes later.  The server that was obviously assigned to our table knew we were there?!   He had no problem chit-chatting with us when we first came in at our table.    During that 25 minute wait, a lady walked by and we literally said excuse me, Excuse me ma'am, EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.  There's no way she didn't hear us.  She totally ignored us.  I finally went inside and kindly asked the lady pulling down the sun shades to send our server outside.  10 MINUTES LATER, he comes out.    Long story short, we leave.  They knew we were upset.    We were so disappointed!  HORRIBLE SERVICE!  Sir, the fact that you were 'changing your shift' is not an excuse.  You were there when we got there and you're still here!

I hear it's much better here if you have a few drinks...maybe to keep your mind off the rude bartender (whom actually snapped at me when picking up a to-go order)....I'm giving my money to Compound Grill now instead!

I am a HUGE fan of Roka Akor.  I am very picky with my sushi and Roka is truly top-notch!  Go for happy hour and order the Butterfish Tataki, burgers, Softshell crab with Mizuna, Hamachi Serrano Chili roll---those are all amazing.   Off the Happy hour menu---the Pork Belly is fantastic, as well as the Kobe Beef.    You really can't go wrong on the food here.    I would have given this place 5 stars, but recently the young brunette girl at the front was very rude---when people walk in, please smile and be welcoming!  Thank you!

Ron came out to our house to tackle a couple of clogged drains.   I was in search of a good deal-----I didn't realize plumbers were so expensive.  Most places I called quoted me $150 minimum.    Ron was very professional and gave us a GREAT deal on the work!  Thanks Ron---I've got your magnet on my fridge!

This place is not overpriced.  I thought it was priced very appropriately.    AMAZING food!  I was so excited to see what Chef Nobuo was all about since I hadn't been to Sea Saw.    We had the Teeter Tots, Grapefruit and Hamachi (almost ordered a 2nd serving of it), Ebi Salad, Pork Belly buns, and the grilled lamb.  All were wonderful!   That with a bottle of wine and a dessert----was around $125.  Not bad for a special night out!   Can't wait to eat here again.
