They say, "If you want to get a job done right, do it yourself". Not anymore when it comes to your A/C & heating needs because Speedy's A/C & Heating does it for you without having to question integrity. They tailored an individual plan that met all my needs AND didn't take advantage of me financially like other companies tried to.   I recommend this company to anyone and everyone! Please do yourselves a favor and  call Speedy today! :)

Hey All!   I have to tell you if you are looking for a quite, simple, yet classy spot to rest your head, check out Lore @ South Mountain. The minute I walked into their office April was super helpful and fun to work with. She went above and beyond to walk me around the complex to show me where my apartment and parking spot are located. She put on her cute flats and said, "Let's go!" with a huge smile. It doesn't get any better than that!   I can honestly say, after looking at 7 places in less than a week, I felt like I was home the minute I walked in. The girls in the office are warm and welcoming. They have great specials, so call them right away and find your next home.   Ohhhh...and did I mention the location is AWESOME!!!! :)  Good luck on your search,  Yvonne

FYI: it's been 6 months since I've been a resident of Lore. Although it is very quite and the office staff is friendly, the issue I've had this far is the parking structure. Parking spaces are ridiculous small - like sardines stuff in a can small!!!! I have to squeeze out of my car In order to get out. My visitors choose to park outside the complex because the visitor spots are extremely small as well.   If parking and your vehicle are important to you, DO NOT choose Lore for your next place. I've made several complaints along with other renters and NOTHING has been done. They decided to renovate the pool in the winter time instead, so they can attract better cliental. We'll after my lease is up, I don't plan on staying unless the parking spots are widen and more comfortable to get in and out of my vehicle.   Good luck all.
