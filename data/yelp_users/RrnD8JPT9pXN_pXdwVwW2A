I normally get the steak Carne Asada Taco's and let me tell you they ROCK!!! You get a plate of three tacos with some chips, beans or rice and  with a drink for about $5-6 bucks. Great stomach filler for cheap. And hey pop a few coins into the jukebox while you wait for some interesting looks haha ;)

Every time we call this place.. they have to decide if they want to deliver? And thus now, "your food sucks". Is there a Negative star rating? Dwarf star rating scale perhaps? Something where due to it's sucking so bad, it's choking on it's own gravitational weight and collapses in on it's self in a fantastically mediocre fashion?

The Kings of Torta I say!! The Torta Mexicana is what you want. Thinly cut steak with grilled onions, avocado and big fat Jalapeno right in the middle! The neighbor hood isn't that great after 5pm. I look Mexican so I blend in well like a chameleon. But it isn't until I try to order that my cover is blown and they figure out that I only speak English and Californian - however it does relax the nervous white folk standing around waiting for their take out!!  =))  P.s. Parking lot sucks and isn't well lit but fight your way in! - You'll be glad you did.

Talk about a bitchen Gyro!!! Load that thing up with the Gardien Peppers & Tzatziki Sauce!! Oh and ask for an extra Tzatziki sauce just because - it's sooo good. I can't really speak for Gyro's in Chicago or for that matter any other place than Phoenix so with that said. THIS PLACE RULES!!  I've had a Gyro over at Greek Town on 7St and while the food was authentic and NO YOU CAN'T have any damn FRENCH FRIES with your Gyro... I dare you to even ask that dude - so while it may be authentic it was also a light weight compared to the Feast of Awesomeness that you'll experience at Chicago Gyros!! and don't forget the extra Tzatziki sauce....   p.s. The Fries are damn good too!!!!!

I live within walking distance of this place. And while it has a nice cool atmosphere for having a drink & smoke outside. Both times our server wasn't friendly or helpful let alone experienced. And the food is at best slightly mediocre. Next time I'll go to Taco's Jalisco in the same parking lot.

Good lunch. Supreme Sandwich or a Bowl of Chili are always rocken!! Breakfast on the other hand go with the Croissant Sandwich.

$9 Burger, Fries & Drink what jep... Like the other guy I can smell frozen patty miles away. Wish it was slightly cheaper but the atmosphere isn't bad. Not sure that I'd recommend this place even to my enemies!!!
