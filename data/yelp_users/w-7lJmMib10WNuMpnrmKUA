This is an awesome spot and honestly a go-to for me and most of my friends. The beer is always solid (ask for the Bourbon-Barrel-Aged Kiltlifter, never advertised, offered rarely, but incredibly worth it) and the food is a cut above typical bar food. For real, apples to oranges kind of comparison. Only downfalls, parking can be a problem and the place is hopping almost any day of the week so if you've got a group of 4 or more it can be tricky getting a spot together right away. Staff is decent too. They usually have the menu and beers down like pro's but with a busy spot like this if you're in a rush and need constant attention this might not be the place for you.

Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...

This place was great! Great food and good service (the owner seems to stop by every table to make sure everything's good). Stopped here for breakfast with my girlfriend and although it took a little while to get our food (20 min. but the place was PACKED because of a local cycling event and Pat's Run) it was well worth the wait!  I got the Carne Adovado and it was delicious! The pork was seasoned perfectly, VERY tender, and the jalapeno cheese on top kicked up the heat just right for the dish! My girlfriends sandwich was pretty good too but she stole a few bites of pork too because it was so good!  The potatoes were also great, and seasoned very well. The only thing that was slightly disappointing was the eggs. Not very fluffy and no flavor to them hardly at all. Perfect for pairing together with bites of the rest of the plate though I guess.  Portion size was great too, we both left completely stuffed! Definitely give these guys a try!

This place might have one of the best beer selections at a reasonable price in all of Tempe. Possibly in the East Valley. Their food is great too, service is decent, and the daily specials they offer are just plain awesome!

Fantastic staff and management! Flatbreads are exceptional as well and there are almost always specials going on that the staff is well-informed on. A must visit for sure!

Amazing place for exceptionally good beer and time with friends! Minimal menu but great collaboration with other local vendors and ordering for delivery at their location is encouraged! Their beer recently passed Four Peaks as my favorite too, not an easy feat! If you're on the fence at all about checking this place out, do yourself a favor and just get yourself there!

Just fantastic. Really. Service, Coffee. Espresso. Food. All off the charts. Great place to study (free wifi) or hang out with a few friends. And seriously, the food here is phenomenal. Not at all what you'd expect when headed to a coffee shop. They've outdone themselves here!
