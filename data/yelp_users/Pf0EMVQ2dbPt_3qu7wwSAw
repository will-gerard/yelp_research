Okay i don't even know where to start... i have been going to this Pep Boys since forever because it is right down the street. But, so I've been told, they changed the management 2 years ago, and it REALLY shows in their service. i was just there today, and i don't care to go into detail because i'm going to get upset again, but basically, the service is SLOW,they are just rude and don't want to take time with a PAYING COSTUMER. The service men are always messing around and they are just as useless as the people running the place inside. They messed up my warranty on my car battery and wouldn't help me change anything because the guy that sold it to me didn't work there anymore so there was "nothing they could do about it'. AND THEN they mess up the charges at the end, and were trying to charge me $40 more than what was talked about to begin with. Idk i was just so frustrated waiting in the freezing cold waiting room and was just annoyed at all of them the whole time. Never again.

Okay it is UNBELIEVABLE how much I am in love with this restaurant. I was introduced by a friend last year, and now I go every chance I get. I live in north phx, so green is a little further away from me, but it is totally worth the drive.   I've tried basically everything on the menu but my favorite dishes have to be the secret chicken BBQ sandwich and the spicy buffalo wings. I used to eat meat but for the past 5 years I have been a vegetarian. I used to miss meat but after I found Green, I stopped having a craving to eat meat. Actually the food at Green is SO MUCH better than any other meats I've had.   My best friend is a full on meat lover, but one day I made her come with me to Green. She was a little skeptical at first but to her surprise she absolutely loved it. So even if you aren't a vegan or vegetarian, this is a must try.  oh and a little side note, the service is so amazing. The employees are so nice and caring. You can tell they really love their job. Also everything inside the restaurant is recyclable stuff.. so it is pretty interesting to look around the place while you are waiting for your food.

I am an avid Starbucks drinker and I've got to say, this is my favorite location!! The baristas are always friendly and are fairly fast. This location does get busy at times but they get the drinks out as quickly as possible :)

CARMEN IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!! I've been wanting to get laser hair removal for the longest time.. But hearing all the horror stories, I was very hesitant. I found Carmen online, and based on her fantastic reviews, I decided to check her out. I went in for a consultation and she was super friendly and very educated. She explained the whole process to me and really showed how much she cares for her clients. I decided to go for it. Since then I've been back for three more sessions and will continue to get my laser done with Carmen. She is affordable, friendly, passionate, educated, and experienced. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO CHECK HER OUT.

Two weeks ago my parents unexpectedly decided to throw a get together at our house so they had asked me to take my dog to get groomed so he looked nice and clean when we had everyone over. So i called my usual groomers to see if they had any last minute appointments and they did not. I did not have any back up groomers who were available, so i decided to look on the Internet for groomers who were close to home. That is when i found this place, Gr8Dogsaz.     I called and got a man on the phone who was very polite and helpful. I asked if they happened to have any appointments asap so I could drop my dog off and be done in a timely manner. He told me to hold on while he checked with the staff. He came back on the line and told me they could squeeze in my dog if i got there asap.     So I get there and they weren't that packed (so it seemed). I checked in with the front counter and "registered" my pup. The guy who i had spoken to on the phone was the one at the front desk taking my information about my dog. As I am filling papers out, an older woman came out and said she would take my dog back. When she took my pup I asked approx how long she will need to get my dog all done. She looked at me like i was crazy and said "Do you see how busy we are? I have no idea how long it will be." First of all she shouldn't have spoken to me that way that she did.. and secondly, she should have some sort of clue how long I should wait to come back.     Anyways, long long story short.. I dropped my dog off there at around 12am and was told to check back in an hour, which seemed reasonable to me. When I did call back I got a lady on the phone who was really nice, but didn't speak very much English. She asked for my dogs name and I said "teddy" she said who, and then i repeated it.. she seemed to have no clue who that was. She was starting to freak me out.. and then she goes "ohhh teddy, he wont be done for another couple hours"..and this is where I started to get really upset. My dog is a really small Maltese and it should only take about an hour to wash and have a simple trim.. Maybe there were a lot of dogs ahead of me but I had no idea, they gave me no information.Anyways, I got a call at around 4 saying Teddy was done and that I could come pick him up.  He did look great, but that doesn't make up for the service.   All in all this place was okay, but not very friendly and made me really uneasy after leaving my baby there... Usually "pet places" go out of there way to make you feel as comfortable as possible because you are leaving your precious "kids there" and I did not get this feeling at all from Gr8Dogsaz.

I will NEVER come back here again. This place is right next to my house and I've come here once before, the first time it was okay.... But this time was a disaster. I normally go to a nail place in paradise valley but today I didn't have time to go all the way down there so I decided to try this place again. I came in and asked if they would be able to take me now or if I should come back later, because I was in a hurry. The lady told me to take a seat because someone was just finishing up.. I said okay great and took a seat. Five minutes later, one lady put my hands in acetone and told me to let them soak, so I did. 10 minutes later another costumer walks in and the lady who was supposed to do my nails finishes and STARTS DOING THIS LADYS NAILS!! And I know she didn't have an appointment because it can't make one on weekends. Anyways long story short I'm sitting there for 30 minutes soaking my hands in acetone and ask will someone be able to help me soon or should I leave? The lady looks at me and says you can go if you want to.... so I picked up my stuff and walked out..  Needless to say I wont be coming back here. I wouldn't even give it one start but I have to...  I don't recommend this place to anyone..
