What Gary M said.  One man, most likely the owner, doing everything.  Waiting tables and cooking.  And the pizzas were just mediocre.  I was hoping for a good experience.

I should give it NO STARS, but it won't let me.  The three girls working there were screaming at each other in Spanish, the man ahead of me had been waiting a long time, the guy 2 ahead of me got charged wrong and the lady was arguing with him (he had a coupon), the lady making my sandwich lost her knife and found it on the counter in a dirty place between the oven and another machine, I asked for her to use another one and she looked at me like I was crazy.  Reluctantly she went in the back to get another one while rolling her eyes.  I stayed to dine there so I could experience more, and EVERY ORDER was screwed up, they were rude to everyone.  And the keyboard to the register was covered in plastic wrap and completely disgusting.

This is the most unexpected marriage of food.  I have to admit, it's kind of fun eating refried beans with chopsticks!

I've been going to this place for years now...it used to be just a tiny little market with almost nothing in it, and it still kind of is.  Now they have a little cafe next door with a nice mix of Greek Lebanese, Persian, etc. etc. foods.  The market is still there and they have almost nothing there, but they've got the staples.   It's my go to place for the best imported tzatziki!  Need a nice variety of fresh baked non leavened bread?  they've got it!  They also make fresh hummus and babaganoj...  I also can't say enough about the employees! So helpful and knowledgeable.

Disgusting.  Never again.  Soup was canned.  Thighs were itty bitty.  The four onion rings I got were all grease.  The bun for the cheese steak was stale and there was next to nothing inside.

Scam! Ordered online, was told order would be here in 10 minutes. Food NEVER SHOWED UP! Called twice and was told my order would be here shortly. Had to request my credit card refuse the charge. What a hassle. These guys should not be in the restaurant business.

I moved to this side of town a little over a year ago and thought I would never find a nail tech I love....well, I did.  Annie is the best and if I can't get in to see Annie, I see John.  They're all super friendly and do a great job every time.  I can call up and not even tell them who I am and they say "Hello, Jeny".  Not kidding.  Love this place.  Plus, it's not boring in there.... it's actually FUN!  No wonder it's always busy!!!

I Really wanted to like this!  Love Mario and Joe...    I had the Royale burger.  The burger was cooked well and the cheese was delicious, but It should have had a sturdier bun because of the cheese and the grease.  It totally fell apart.  My fiance had the lobster roll -- and I know, I know, he should have known better than to order seafood in a hamburger joint, but hey -- if Mario and Joe have their names on it, it MUST still be good, right?  NOPE.  The roll was so little.  Like the size of a hot dog bun at cousin Joey's BBQ.  And because of the size of the bun,  not much lobster could fit in there.  WAY over priced.  Seriously the whole dinner was over priced.  We spent $138 on 2 sandwiches, an order of fries, and 3 well drinks.  On top of it all, after dinner we went outside in front of the Venetian to watch the gondolas.  And what did we see?  An outdoor patio for B & B Burgers and Beer.  I was so mad!!!  We didn't know it was there, otherwise we would have asked for patio dining!  The hostess didn't even offer it to us!!!!  Instead we were forced to sit inside in an overly casual atmosphere with an almost childish decor -- at 10pm.  If we had been able to sit outside under the soft patio lighting, watching the gondolas in a peaceful, romantic atmosphere, I assure you my review would not have been so harsh.

My husband and I stopped in here to check it out and we were so pleasantly surprised!  What a gem to find so close to home.  The bar was clean and spacious and the food was delicious.  The staff was more than accommodating and we will definitely be coming back.  What a find!
