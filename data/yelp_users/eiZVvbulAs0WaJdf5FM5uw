I get my car washed here a lot never a problem! Today I left with water spots on my car and they told it was because I parked next to a sprinkler and it was the hard water that produced the stains. Might I remind you that I get my cars (plural) washed here a lot! Wtf are these ppl telling me!? They said in order to remove them I have to get it buffed and detailed! Guess what? If the water spots come from my sprinklers, then every time I bring my car in for a wash, there will be water spots from the same damn sprinklers... because that is where I park and the same damn sprinkler will always be present! BUT I never left with that lame reason AND with water spots THAT IS ONLY REMOVABLE BY A $120 detailed! You ever wonder why your reviews are in the 3 stars?

Been here once awhile ago. Service is great. Sushi is not that great, too much rice on the rolls and little sashimi. The sushi doesn't seem very fresh. Maybe just this location. I also ordered steak and calamari. Honestly, I'd come for a drink or watch the games, otherwise this is not a dinner place nor do they have good food.

I come here a lot either dine in or take out. The service is always great either way. My favorite usuals here are Waldorf chicken salad (full-size), jambalaya fettuccini, and spaghetti Kung pow (chicken & shrimp). I often get the gift cards from costco whenever they have available $80 for $100 worth of gc. Even without that deal, I'd still eat here.

I've always liked their house-salad and their calamari. They need to go easy on the salt with the bread sticks. Could never complain about their service. The new menu is good. Avoid holidays for this location, the wait is seriously a killer.

If you like quiet, romantic dinner, then this is the spot. There were 3 of us and we ordered 3 entrees, 2 sides, and a glass of wine.  Our bill was $200+  pricey? Yes! But it was worth it. The steaks and lamb chop were outstanding, even their stuffed mushrooms were flavorful. I don't recommend adding a side salad, as it's not anything significant, and it's $7-8 bucks.

Been here once. The sushi is good and fresh. This place is loud, not for family. Just like RA. I love their baby yellow tail dish. Their rolls are bite-sizes, literally. Ppl gather around the bar area to meet others, it's the loudest place of the restaurant. I don't feel the teppanyaki table is secluded.

The dim sum here are better at the moment, used to be unappealing. There is definitely something wrong with the shrimp fried rice. I continually tried to give them chances after chances to improve, but all 3 times the shrimps had this pee-like taste and smell! They are definitely not fresh, but rather long-dead and smelly! Other than their dim sum, lunch and dinner are not great. The roasted pork is ok, in the mean time. The father of the owner, who usually in charge of roasted and BBQ area is extremely rude and loud.

I've been here a couple time and I never like the male cashier. It feels like I was there asking for free food and they are so annoyed taking my orders. I usually order around $50 worth of take out and I should spend that at another place. However, Thai ice tea and beef salad is good.

It is unfortunate that this chain got low rating. Been here couple times a year and never had problems. One time my awesome blossom looked dark and I gave them a feedback. The manager asked if I'd want another one but I was almost finished, so I said it was ok, just a feedback. The manager instantly took it off my tab and offered me a dessert. I didn't take it bc we don't do dessert. She insisted that I take it home after dinner. I felt awful bc that was not my intention. I don't know about the management now bc I haven't been there in the past 6 months.

The food isn't that great, does not make you want to come back for more. Service is ok. I don't really know how they are still operating with the kind of menu they have. You can find their gift cards $80 for $100 value at costco if you love this place.

Been here once. Sat at the bar for instant sushi. Very fresh and good quality. I wouldn't say that they are better than other places that I've tried. I love their sashimi salad. Not a big fan of their soup, too creamy. So I tried the udon soup, it is not that great, taste like water and not broth.

I used to go the teppanyaki table, then switched to the bar for quicker service. I don't like the hostesses at this place because they think they are superior to the customers. They do not realize that we pay them for the food and services, not asking them for free. If I asked, "Do you know how long it's gonna be for the bar?" "It's first come first serve," is not the correct answer. If I proceed to the bar for a seat, "you have to sign in for a seat at the bar" sounds rather rude than welcoming. Who hired these idiots?

Again, after 10 months of the first review and sporadic visits to this place. I am still displeased with the hostesses of this place. They cannot manage the flow of traffic nor the reservation. So disappointed!!

Price is reasonable. Good food and service. Can be loud sometimes. Not very appealing happy hour menu and the happy hour menu is way off. I always order a lot and take home leftovers bc they are good even the next day.

I don't recommend this place unless you are sitting right at the main revolver with the chefs. The sashimi pieces here are dried. The price is good, but the distribution of the sushi plates on the revolver is the major problem here. Nobody bother to put the freshly done rolls on the far end of the revolver. I will not come back since this one is the worse out of all the restaurants I have tried.

I used to live in Orange County and I would never eat at this chain. But here in Mesa, this chain is better than other Vietnamese restaurants in the vicinity. I discovered that they have pretty good Hu Tieu nam vang and nem nuong Nha trang.

I live right behind the mall and often shop in-store and online. One time, after I finished shopping and about to leave the store the alarm went off. I stood around and no one came to check the security for me. The girls at the cosmetic department were just hanging around. I had my 2 year old sitting in a $20 stroller with Macys shopping bags on one handle, and the other handle has my open tote w/ no zipper. No one is approaching, so I had to do it myself, $260 worth of cheap clothes so there were 12-15 items, I forgot. After I checked and made sure no security tags I proceed to leave the store. As I was leaving an associate came and stopped me and wanted to check my bags. I told her I checked already and I'm ok. She insisted on going through my bags just to make sure. I told her I have to go pick up my daughter as it was approaching 2:30. She said that it's policy and insinuated that I have unpaid items. I got frustrated because I stood around and had to do the security work myself and no one helped for like 2-3 minutes and now this?? I was so mad I told her to take everything back bc I have to leave. This associate knew I was in a hurry and dragged the procedure. I used to work for department stores and I'm positively sure that when the alarm goes off, all associates are to be alerted and proceed to the help with shoppers' bags. After the incidence, I called the store and explained the whole situation. I'm pretty sure they reviewed the cameras and sent me two $25 gift certificate. Honestly, $50 cannot represent an apology for calling me a thief.

I've lived in chandler for 6 years and I've never heard of their aquatic centers. This is a public park with water slides and pools for families with small children. My family of 4 cost us less than $7. You can bring food and drinks here and have your own picnic!!

Seems like this particular Starbucks is always understaffed. The wait is always forever and they often make the drinks wrong! A couple times they handed me someone else's black coffee when I ordered a hazelnut macchiato, and of course its after I left the drive-thru that's when I found out. How inconvenient it is to go back to get the right one.

It is a niiiice place for a romantic dinner, I personally loved the dimmed light atmosphere. I was recommended the Kobe steak, which I thought was not any better than their rib-eye. So you can save your money on that! I love their oyster!! Super fresh!! Not a fan of their pie.

Sushi was really good with variety of selections. Creative rolls that I didn't have to use the sauce. I ordered 69 rolls, poke tuna, what the heck, salmon wraps, etc. absolutely love all of them! Will come back to try other items on their menu, sure worth 14 miles drive.

This particular store is big but not very quiet if you want to come and read. The service is great and the greeting over the intercom is always a pleasant, especially from male-baristas. They are always trying to move the drive-thru quickly enough, not taking their sweet time like the one on Ray/ 101

I really like the chicken tortilla soup here and their Pollo Monterey is delicious! Steak is ok, chip and dips are good. Portion side is madness, feels like one entr√© can serve two.

The sashimi pieces on the rolls are a tad dry-looking, not appealing. The rest that don't come with sashimis are delicious. I ordered cherry blossom (?), the sashimi wrapped with cucumber is very fresh! The prices are very reasonable. Will come back again!

I do not like hearing the business phone and the guy answering the phone on the other side of my curtain. This is a relaxing and quiet place, mind the noise!! It's irritating to hear all the locomotion while I'm trying to relax that is what I paid for! 90 minutes to relax with no interruption! The restroom fan is pretty loud too. I can't come back to this place!

5 stars for quality and freshness. Been here 3 times and have always liked their food. I don't think I would be back just bc the last time I came, the restaurant was full; instead of telling me they were full and behind, they took me in. There were only 2 sushi chefs and 3 waiters and the table were full. All of the restaurants that I've been to, they would tell me how long the wait would be so that I have a choice to leave or to wait. This place happily took my party in and it took them 2 hours to complete my order. I feel like I get each order every half hour. No food is worth that kind of waiting time.

4 stars and not 5 because I've had better. It's by far the best in the area, I especially like their tamarind seasoning. The atmosphere is hella loud. I do not get why there's a wait when there are tables available. The service is ok, though there are plenty of rooms for improvement.

I got beef salad. Drunken noodle. Basil chicken fried rice. Tom yum shrimp. All are delicious. Great portion. Highly recommended. I've been to Yupha Thai, Rama Thai, Thai basil, and Paradise Thai. This is my favorite!

Came back last night with friends. The service has improved, servers were more attentive than the previous experience. I was recommended the clams with lemon pepper seasoning. It was really salty, I wouldn't try it again. Before that I had the Louisiana style and that sure tasted better. This time around, I gave the hot and juicy seasoning a try, and it was pretty good. I recommend everything in the hot and juicy seasoning bc it wasn't salty.
