I've only been here once and it was OK. If you're into the English pub scene, you would probably like it since everything is decently priced. However, a friend of mine tells me that they broke into her car on a Friday night, smashed the window and all, so I would be careful about what you leave in your vehicle.

Since this place is set up rather simpke, I'll make my review the same. Good deal for the money for dogs, beef, burger or, sausage.  The don't over do it with the toppings so enjoy it all..

Funny...when I return to my office after eating here, my colleagues raved about how awesome it it. Not as funny, I didn't agree. I did like the atmosphere and the service, but I thought the prices were a little high for lunch although the serving was good. I had the chicken fajitas which were ok. I thought it was a different kind of style than I am used to so I wasn't impressed.  I'd like to give it another shot before I totally condemn a place that is obviously popular, but it's back to Chuy's and Ernie's for now....

I first used La Grande Orange to provide sandwiches for a meeting I was organizing in that area so it worked out. At first I kind of balked art the price but then when they found out it was for a non-profit, boom - got a nice discount!  I've been eating sandwiches there ever since. Great location especially if you live in the Arcadia district which is where I'm planning to move soon.  PS - MMMMMMM...Green Chile Burger........

The owner is an East Coast and ASU guy and is a riot. Bartenders are nice, service is good, sometimes can get a bit slow when it's crowded but that wouldn't drive me away., They have bands playing there now on occasion and that seems to draw in a crowd. Oh, and did I mention they have $1 jello shots?

I was told to see Greg after a local shop diagnosed my exhaust problem.  He took a few minutes to look at my car, told me what I needed and what it would cost. I went back a week later, he did the work in the time he told me it would take and there was no surprises and my car is doing well. I would recommend this place over ANY muffler shop. Plus you support local business and not a chain.

I've been to the Grotto a few times since they have good bands and a couple of them are friends of mine. But last was strange. The band was great (I'm probably biased on that since the singer is a friend of mine) but what was the deal with the $4 dollar bottles and drafts? Also, the bartenders working last night kinda sucked - not friendly at all and slow with the service. I'll be back again for more music but if I have the same experience with getting drinks, I'm done.

For reasons I can't explain, they choose to clean the soft ice cream machine on Monday which means you can't get any on that day. Even though I didn't walk in until 8pm and they clean it in the morning. Doesn't sound like a good business decision to me so until that is resolved, I'll get me soft ice cream some where else. too bad because this is so close to my house.

I started going here since the place was in walking distance from my house. I've since moved about 5 miles away but still go to Doc's quite a bit. Tim, Geo, Kat always take good care of me and the crowd is cool. It's not like I'm going to meet Ms. Right here but my friends hang out here and there's always a good crowd for UFC.

The wait is worth it - plus this gets you a FRESH dog, brat, sausage whatever you order since they don't grill it until you order. My fave is actually the Italian Sausage - the peppers and onions rock! Chili dogs are good and one of these days I'll have a burger.  Plus, there's plenty of seating and everything is reasonable on the pricing side. The pride of Buffalo in Tempe - who would have thought?

When I lived in the East Valley some five years ago, I used to go here all the time, loved the chili dogs. However, after my last tow trips there, the last one being today, I think I have to say farewell to Ted's. I don't mind the lines since they ask you for your order while well back in line (Although they should wait until you check out to pour your drink, the ice was about gone by the time I got my iced tea) but the dogs were kind of burnt and chili lacked any kind of zing what so ever. For 10 bucks, I would expect more.

I first came in here when a friend was on business in Tucson. This was a Wednesday and they had a nice Taco special. I hadn't been for a while and stopped in last night on my way home. The bartenders are not only GORGEOUS but they are warm and friendly and take good care of everyone. The beer is cold (although $3.75 for a Bud is a little brutal) and the crowd is nice. Good place to catch a game, I will be back since I do some work at the Sports Complex.

OK, I'm an East Coast guy where getting a good sandwich is not really a challenge. However, the corner deli is just an urban legend out here. That being said, I've been on a long quest to find some good sandwiches.   Sacks is one of the better ones which I can't believe I never even knew existed until I started working across the street from the Thomas Rd locale. Even though there always a crowd (we go at 11:30 to avoid that but there is still a heavy volume), they get your order processed quickly, the sandwiches are healthy and they have a good choice of iced teas (Go Mango!)

This is a cool dive away from all the Old Town BS. The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in some time. They were playing songs I never heard of so I know I'm going to be in trouble in the future by using Shazam to identify songs and then buying them from my phone! Anyway, just be sure you eat before you get there as this is all about hanging in a dive and having drinks. They have lots of beer and the bartenders are cool. If I lived closer I would hang out here much more......

Thanks to Dr. Stewart, my life was changed forever 6 years ago when she contacted me to ask if could take "Roscoe", a stray that she and the ACDR team loved and fostered. At the time I was a manager at a no-kill shelter. He came (or ran) into the building and adopted me and he is now Elvis!!. It made sense to have Bridget remain as his vet since she knew him best. They also loved Ginger and helped with some of the rescue dogs that needed some medical attention. This past week I added Daisy to my family and the team was awesome as usual..

Since I live in the east Valley and work in Central Phoenix, I need a few good watering holes to kill time while the traffic clears. Rosie's is one of those places that has a local watering hole feel. Plus they have good beer, good happy stuff and everyone in there from the bartenders to the people are cool.

Lenny's is within walking distance of my office so why did it take me this long to stroll on over for a burger? I had the Mexican Burger, full of onions and green chilis, a healthy serving of fries and a 32 oz'er for $6 - well worth it. We went at 11:30 and it was starting to fill up, but they take care of you quick. Next time, Chili dog, you're mine, all mine!!

OK, so I guess I will call this the world's slowest Starbucks. And I have to agree with the other Yelper who reviewed this location since they got my order wrong as well. while I appreciate friendly and good customer service, it seems that the cashier was more concerned with socializing amongst her colleagues. I didn't think that "Chai" sounds remotely like "Mocha"  I still dig Starbucks, especially the marble and pumpkin cakes. I'll just stick to my other spots.

Maybe I came the wrong day, but the pizza I had was really dry, no zest at all. The price was good but I expected more since my friend raves about this place and there were lots of good reviews   I will come back soon and give it a second chance.  Hope they will see this. Oh, the guys working there were cool.

A friend of mine comes here all the time and if you read my other reviews you know I'm a beer guy. Laura carries different beers and every time I am there, it's always a new flavor for me. I also wanted to thank Laura for being generous to some of the charities I am involved with, She has hosted a few fundraisers and they are always a good time. My friends come and buy wine there and are never disappointed.

I've  been here a few times now (the first time was the Oktoberfest, so I really can't count that), and I love all the beer they have here. I also like the fact that they keep changing the beers and even though when I went last night and they didn't have my favorite red beer, bartender Ryan hooked me up with a few samples so I could choose a flavor for my palette.  The beer never disappoints, neither does the food. Had the sliders last night, yummy.....This place seems to be the cornerstone for what's becoming a nice little downton district in Chandler.

So....a vendor of mine does some business with Stacy's and we talked about how they may be able to help the Foundation I raise funds for. To get in his good graces, we went to lunch there today, my first time there. I love BBQ and after reading some reviews, I was looking forward to it.  It's as good as advertised! I had the pulled pork and was tasty and juicy. My colleagues had the brisket and the ribs. Sampled a rib and it was also great. Although I had to wait a few extra minutes for my corn on the cob, it was sweet and juicy and worth the wait.  While we were finishing up, Stacy himself came by and had us sample of few of his other sauces and the Carolina recipe was awesome. I am a fan and will be back to this funky little building.

I've been working with Mark for a couple of years now as I am involved in rescue. He's got a real calm demeanor which is just what is needed when evaluating dogs. Watching him action, I have learned quite a bit from as well as from our lengthy conversations. He's always willing to help me out and I appreciate that!  I have probably given over two dozen referrals to Mark from families I adopted out dogs to and they all come back to me with positive feedback. He was last working with one of our dogs that is blind and he's doing great. I would recommend Mark to anyone who needs a behavioral correction with their pooch!

So my friend was in town staying with her Dad who lives near Boeing. Since I don't hang out around there I really didn't know where to go so when I read some of the reviews for Smokey's, we thought we would check it out.  It's a great dive bar and bartender Stacy was cool and took care of us. Good people we talked to and the music on the juke was great. It happened to be open mic night so there were a few locals on acoustic who weren't bad either.  If I'm in this part of town, I'd go again.

Those who know me know that I am a beer guy at heart. However, having known Bryan a couple years through mutual friends, I came to find out that he and Nancy are animal lovers and like to support the local rescue I am a part of. So I started hanging out at the new place and I love it and bring friends to check it out. They've got a few beers as well, prices are good, Bryan takes care of the regulars and the people are nice, no Scottsdale snobs in this place. Plus you can go to Groupon and take advantage of that as well.

My car key broke and since I wasn't going to tow it to the dealer to get a new key made, I needed to find someone. I made five phone calls and Levi was not only the most affordable, he told me he would be there in about 30 minutes ( I was stranded up near Cave Creek) and he did arrive in 30 minutes. got the key cut, made a free spare (although it won't start my car, it's just an emergency in case I would lock my keys in the car). He did it quick and I would recommend him and his guys.,

Home of the $2 Dos....Equis that is... Since this is the closest to my house (and I've been to the others) I like coming here when I feel like an after work beer and an afternoon breeze. the bartenders here are always good to me (which unfortunately, is more than I can say for the Scottsdale crew, just seems to much of a clique up there).  Love the food, love the crowd here as well.I'll miss you when I move Chandler DOS

I had stopped here a couple of times on the way home to catch Monday Night Football while the traffic was still heavy. They have a great rib special for the games. Lots of nice screens and a long bar.  Hadn't been for a while but met a friend there for lunch the other day and now he is a fan. I had the sliders which are nice for the $8 price and my friend had the spaghetti and meatballs which he sais was good. Also like the $3 Dos Equis specials and the nice crowd was a plus.  I'm looking to move to this area of town so I'm sure this will be a spot for me. I don'y get the valet parking however....

This review is only for the sandwich I had today because I have always been satisfied with what I order from here and the soups are amazing and the service is top notch. However, the BLT I ordered today was not what I would consider up to AJ's standards. It was pretty much all bread and the bacon was in little bits, not strips. I will continue to shop here but I hope someone reads this so they know that they can do better. All other sandwiches I have ordered have had plenty of meat.

I was excited about having a NY og with the red onions I love so much. I don't know why they (and other hot dog shops) cant use the standard bun instead the fancy ones that are just too much bread. Anyway, if you order, ask them to hold the mustard so you can apply it yourself. They flooded mine with mustard and killed any chanve of enjoying the onions.

I live just off one of the fairways and have probably spent more time on the course walking my dogs than playing but I played Kokopelli a while back and purchased a discount card that also applies to Stone Creek. Although the course is in good shape I think it lost some of it's character when they decided to cut down a lot of trees. The guys in the pro shop said it was to speed up play but it still took almost five hours to play. And what's with the $4.50 for a pint of beer? I didn't feel like I got my money's worth, so probably back to Kokopelli for me.

I didn't even know this place existed until I drove by it looking for a "host" bar for my volleyball league that plays at Scottsdale Ranch. Well, timing is everything because I got to meet Dimitri the owner who not only fielded a team for the league but agreed to be our host and he has lived up to the billing!  The bar itself is pretty cool too - lots of big screens and plenty of room to host large groups. Happy Hour deals are great and the appetizers rock! If you live in the area, you should check it out!!

In fact, one of the bartenders got his dog through me (I work in animal rescue). Anyway, I've had the tacos, chicken strips and some others but I'm mostly in it for the cold beer, watching games and talking sports with the bartenders. Good group and I also like doing some day drinking here.

I was in a bind with my car being undriveable. I am used to relying on local mechanics since franchised or chains make me worry. The tow truck driver recommended this location and personally called Scott before he even towed my car. I knew there was extensive damage and was worried about the cost but Scott worked with me and saved me a few dollars and I had my car back after basically one full day. They also have a 90 days same as cash payment plan which helps although I did have to put up half the cost. All in all, I am satisfied. In fact, I had to order a new rim and tire and he gave me his contact info so I can order over the phone and they went and picked it up.

YFvPti5GZjoIj1RV0EBsmg
I needed to write an update as I am disappointed in one thing I was told in regards to the 90 days same as cash. If you are in a bind and need to go on a payment plan, you may want to consider other options. The bank they use to finance whatever balance you owe is a serious rip-off. It will take you forever to get out of the hole unless you make huge payments (which of course, if you could afford, you would;t need the financing). The bank they use charges $2.31 a day in interest so by the time your monthly payment rolls around, 2/3 of it is already back on your balance. If I would have read the fine print I may have reconsidered using this service but what can you do when you need your car? Just another example of people with money preying upon those who don't. This is as bad as those payday loand that thankfully went away.....

All the gals there are friendly and the service is good. In fact today when I mentioned to the owner's brother that I had not tried the apple cider (it was jalapeno for me today) he went and got me some to try - that's treating the customer right!

This is a good spot and there are lots of rooms to choose from and the prices are good. I have used this more of an opportunity to practice - my band rehearses at one our members houses', but being the drummer living in a condo, I need a place to practice. sometimes I bring my kit, other times I just play the kits they have there. Mike is a cool guy and always takes care of me, especially the time I left my sticks at home!

I've been coming here for about a year now and like many, found this little gem by accident. Oh my goodness, this is a popcorn lovers paradise. I started with Spicy Buffalo Wing and have been back for jalapeno cheddar, beer cheddar, bacon cheddar and also picked up smores for a friend. Kim is great and she's also very giving. I don;t know what happened to the person who had bad service, that has never been the case when I am here and that's quite often.

I didn't know much about these great folks until I went to visit a dog that was being returned to my rescue. Shayna and Rebecca are not just nice people, they are truly people who care about the well being of all the dogs who come through their door. The facility (which is going to expand soon) is clean, the kennels are friendly and warm (my recsue's dog has her own couch!) and the proximity of the golf course makes for a good area to walk them. I want to thank the gals for being accommodating to my rescue's situation and would recommend anyone who needs to board their dog to bring them here, they will take good care of your pooch!

I haven't brought my dogs for an overnight stay but have left them there for a full day of care which is between 10 and 12 hours. The place is great and they don't have to go outside to take care of business as this place is so modern it is self sustaining. My dogs are always tired when I pick them up. $35 for a day (they discount my second dog) is totally worth it. Tony, Lauren and their team are great!

I will have to go back and perhaps try a hook and ladder. I went for the first time and ordered the meatball. On the board it says that it includes Italian sausage but there was none on my sandwich. The service was good but I'm not convinced it was worth the price.

Mike is the man! Not only do he and crew show up on time and get the job done, he is also willing to offer insight on how to improve your place of business. Mike gave his time very generously to a project I was working on for a local business. He came out prior to the job to survey the work needed, took lots of notes and showed up with his crew (also a bunch of nice guys and gals) and did everything we asked for and then some. I would highly recommend Handy Hero for your service needs.
