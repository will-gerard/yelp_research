Love the Swizz!  Reminds me of back home in the Midwest.  Good times and great spot to mingle and meet new people!

The carne adovada dish with eggs on top is to die for.  The restaurant also has a fantastic ambiance.  Wine racks floor to ceiling, low lighting, and an obscure entrance all contribute to a nice, cozy feeling inside.

I rate Luci's highly for a remarkable staff, excellent coffee drinks, and for its very local feel.  Like John K says, this coffee shop has a small-town feel, and if you want to make new friends in the neighborhood, try out Luci's.  The groceries are a bit overpriced in my opinion, but I suppose that comes with being a small retailer...

Rick Patrick does a fantastic job with my hair.  I highly recommend him.  And if you are lucky, he will have Laura shampoo your hair.  I'm a professional massage therapist, and I am always thoroughly impressed by Laura's scalp massage.

The Garage has a beer and wine selection that is above average though not remarkable by any stretch of the imagination.  The burgers are weak, but I would recommend trying one of their salads, which are some of the best I have had in the valley.  Good job with the interior.  During the winter months, the bar area opens onto a small patio.

20 minutes and counting at the drive through window. I'll be looking forward to finding a new bank after my loan is paid off.

I fell in love with Louisiana's food when I first visited there earlier this year.  Sandra Dee transports you straight back to the Bayou with her cajun food.  Spicy, Fried, and Delicious.  Plus, her big southern personality makes you feel right at home, like you're part of the family.  Love it!

There were two things that I feel merit the 5 star rating.  One is Jodie's knowledge as a stylist.  She's a walking encyclopedia when it comes to hair, which is a must for me.  I don't let amateurs touch my hair.  The other reason for the 5 stars is her studio.  Very Clean.  Nice shabby-chic motif.  I like that she runs fashion shows during the cut.
