This is a must read! Ok, food was actually good, but one star for one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had.  I read all the yelp reviews and wanted to give this place a chance, so I did and won't do it again. Please, please, please don't go here. I called in an order to pick up, the guy couldn't understand me and said 5-7 minutes. Drove over there, clarified my order (which he had wrong) and waited. Apparently they were short staffed so the "waitress" was doing a delivery. After waiting 10-15 more minutes I gave him a credit card, he said he didn't know how to work the machine, so I patiently waited for the "waitress" aka delivery lady to come back.   This is where it gets good, she charges me a wrong amount, less, but I didn't notice and just wanted to get out of there. So I generously tip them out of guilt and then get a call from them asking for my credit card because she didn't charge me for everything. I explained I wasn't driving back there, she asked for my CC over the phone and refused. I felt their service was horrible and it was their mistake. Had I not wasted 20+ minutes there (as my food got cold) I would have not been so stubborn. Bottom line- don't do it! Money is too precious to waste on places like this.

Definitely make an appt before you go. I liked the low key sales approach. They told me my fuel injector needed replaced but for $89 I told them I would wait and check with my mechanic after reading the other review. Plan on being there for 45 min though.

Good prices and relatively quick turnaround. I like that it is run by a few ladies and it's like walking into your mom's sewing room. Lastly, I was extremely happy with the results of shortening the hem on 2 skirts, replacing a zipper on a pair of jeans and patching jeans as well. AND she stitched up a tear I had in a pair of dress pants when I picked up my stuff at no charge.

The people working at this store are awesome- they remembered me the both times I went in.  I will drive to this Autozone over the others because they are so friendly.  There was a line both times, but with the summer heat in AZ, a lot of people needed new batteries.  Bottom line- great Autozone!

I really like this place. It's close to home and the staff here is pretty cool. Great specials on drinks and I have been impressed with their food. I either order chicken fingers with honey mustard because it's kinda spicy or the rueben and neither let me down.   I feel like I'm in Cheers- same people here everytime I come and the vibe is very chill.  I want to recommend this place, but I feel like it is a secret spot so don't tell your friends ;)  if you are in the area looking for a drink then definitely stop by.

I am huge fan of this place!  I have been going there for about 3 years now as they are very close to my office.  I can call in an order, drive over there in 5 minutes and it is ready for me.  It is always the same gentleman helping me as the cashier.  The quality of the food is AWESOME!!  I am pretty snobby about my Asian food :-).  The only thing that I get confused on is do I tip?

Don't waste your time or money. Service was bad (granted it was her second day according to the bar tender) but food was not good! The nori tasted bitter and was probably really old and the fish sure didn't take like fish. I should have know when I walked in and there were only 2 tables. Just because it is a good location (kinda- it was hard to get out) doesn't mean you should go. Stay away!  I think I'm going to be sick.

My friend took me here, said I had to go and now I have been twice! This place rocks! The first time I went they helped me get started and gave me a free togo box, normally they charge 50 cents for it (which sounds weird, but isn't until you go).  This is a build your own Asian Meal place! AWESOME!! You can pick your meat, your veggies and your sauce and they cook it up for you- so fun and so yummy- each time you go you can get what you want, but switch up the sauces or keep it the same and since it is build your own, you will definitely have leftovers and they are just as good the second time around!

Best Atmosphere for any hour of the day for sure.  Every dish that I have ordered there has been fantastic!  The pretzel bread on their burger is amazing!  The only reason that I give 4 stars rather than 5 is the service- I have had my order messed up and it seems to take a little longer than I think it should be HOWEVER they are ALWAYS busy so that needs to be taken into account.  Maybe they should have another server on, who knows, I am not the management :-)

Love this place- friendly staff with a variety of menu options and lots of yummy salads.  I almost always get a salad and have yet to find one that I don't like.  I haven't tried any pastas, but they look good.  The soups are always good too, but definitely ask for some bread to dip in the soup!

Best authentic Mexican food in Phoenix that I have ever had! They have an amazing salsa bar with flavors I never could have thought to be salsas. I have the mahi burro and it was awesome. Everything made from scratch down to the tortillas. It's in a kind of "rough" location, but don't let that stop you from this place!

As I read the "Meh, I've experienced better" I thought, yes, this is how I felt.  I went in 45 minutes before close and it took 30 min minimum to get out of there.  I really wish it was taken into account that I went in and spent money on a new iPhone and the amount of money that I spend monthly with them, that the service and attitudes of the staff would be A+...maybe it is a bigger issue on a corporate level... darn AT&T...

LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE HERE! The server was very friendly and personable.  I took my mom here when she was in town from Colorado after my boyfriend recommended it.  It's all inside, but you feel like you are outside.  It is important to note that it is NOT THE SAME MENU as the VIG, but that does not discount the food quality whatsoever.  There is small overlap so that I am not confusing anyone.  Menu is not overwhelming, it is actually relatively small, but I liked that.    It's cool to see a spin off of the same restaurant in a different area.

So happy with Learning Pawsibilities!  They have been very helpful and reassuring for an (over) protective doggy mamma.  We have two mutts that we bring and they have so much fun all day long that all they can do is sleep!  One night my husband had to carry our puppy outside to go potty she had so much fun.  Lena, Mirna & Marc are all lovely and also teach manners while the furbabies are there!  Thank you for being so wonderful.
