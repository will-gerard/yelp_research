So I am from Phoenix, AZ, but recently visited Champaign with the boyfriend for the holidays.  I have been hearing about Sam's breakfast, in particular the french toast, for months now.  I love french toast, it is my favorite breakfast food.  I wasn't expecting much, thinking that it was sure to be less fantastic than my boyfriend claimed it to be.  Sam's is the epitome of a greasy spoon.   No frills decor, you walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom and your table is likely to be wobbly.  The server took care of us but was busy with other tables so the service was polite and attentive but short and sweet.  We each ordered a breakfast special and then split an order of french toast.  The breakfast special items (eggs, meat, toast, hashbrowns) were basic but good.  The french toast?  Ridiculous.  Seriously, the best french toast I've ever had.  The cook dips the bread in thinned out pancake batter and then fries it up.  It is rich, crispy and seasoned with powdered sugar and cinnamon.  It was a tasty breakfast on a cold, rainy day.  When the Illini basketball team walked in the door, my boyfriend was in heaven.    At the end of the meal we realized that we didn't have any cash and Sam's doesn't take cards.  Because my boyfriend was a regular in his college days, Gus, the owner, was nice enough to let us leave, get some cash and come back to pay.  Our total was about as pleasing as the french toast.  12 bucks and change for two coffees, two specials and french toast.  Crazy cheap.  Sam's is far away from home, but we'll visit everytime we're in Champaign.

I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know, Ajo Al's, Macayo's, Garcia's, etc.  At this point, it is still a treat for me, but I would rather eat at the authentic Mexican dive with actual Spanish on the menu, dishes I don't recognize and very few white people in the place.  El Nopalito fits the bill perfectly.  This place first popped up on my radar after seeing frequent mentions on Chowhound.  It was right in my neighborhood, but I never got around to trying it until last week.   We showed up on a Friday night starving and exhausted from teaching small children and, sadly, laying off employees.  Ick.  We started with two Cokes and some homemade chips with both a green and red salsa.  Both salsas were outstanding, which in my experience is rare.  Generally if you get two salsas on the table, one is terrible and one is at least decent.  And Mexican cokes in the cool bottles?  Yay!  Then we ordered a bowl of tortilla soup to share.  This was flavorful and the tortilla strips were nice and crispy.  We only ordered one portion to share but the server brought us two full bowls and charged us for one.  Generous.  The only room for improvement was temperature.  The soup could have been hotter.  Next, we ordered green chile chicken enchiladas and...and...and I forgot the name of my entree.  It was, however, the server's recommendation and she didn't let me down.  My dish was steak with bacon, green peppers, onions and cheese melted over the top.  All of this was served over two corn tortillas.  Super good.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The green chile chicken enchiladas were outstanding and the green chile was the best my boyfriend has ever had.  The rice was flavorful and tender and beans great as well.  I had the leftover enchiladas today for lunch and they were awesome all over again.  We'll be back to El Nopalito often.  I'm excited to try the 99 cent street tacos.

I've been coming here for years.  I try out another place from time to time, but really DV can't be beat for the price.  You could go to a higher end salon and pay 50 bucks for a pedicure.  But, me?  I'd rather keep it real and only pay 19 bucks (before tip).  They have nice product (OPI) and clean facilities. The TV is on but not blaring and the techs are flexible about making conversation or leaving you in peace to enjoy your service.  They take both walk-ins and appointments but I've always walked in.  I've had to wait on occasion but only because they were really busy.  Not a biggie though because I like to catch up on my magazine reading.

Rochelle gives awesome haircuts, Lindsay always takes good care of my brows and they use bumble and bumble products.  The salon is clean, comfortable and well decorated.  Go.  Make an appointment.  You won't regret it.

So after an exhausting day the man and I decided we wanted to be waited on for dinner.  However we couldn't come up with a style of food we were hungry for.  Now, when this happens my boyfriend invariably reverts to his inexplicable love for TGI Fridays.  I don't really understand the infatuation.  Friday's is fine, I guess, but when there are so many other better options why bother?  Plus there isn't one remotely close to my house.  So i start rattling off other pub-ish type places in the area where he might have a similar (but better) experience.  We settled on Wally's.  I had been once before but this was his first time.  When we walked in, the host gave us our choice of seating and we decided on a high top near the bar.  As we settled into our seats and took a look around, we agreed that the ambiance and decor are homey and welcoming without being obnoxious.  In fact, it sort of looks like a low key Friday's.    Our waiter came by promptly and took drink orders.  Wally's has a decent beer selection and the bf thought they had a nice whiskey selection as well.  We noticed how good the calamari looked as it was delivered to a nearby table and ordered that to start.  As we waited for it to arrive, we concentrated on our figuring out our entree orders.  I ultimately went with the chicken quesadilla off the appetizer menu and the bf ordered the Frisco burger.  The server was accommodating and helpful, making suggestions and answering questions as needed.  He specifically mentioned that the chipotle mayo on the burger was fantastic.  When the calamari arrived, we dug in.  The calamari well well cooked, with crispy breading and tender meat.  The marinara it was served with though was underwhelming.  We sat for a minute wondering whether to send it back or just deal.  Then, my bf said, "I wonder how that chipotle mayo would be with the calamari?"  Genius.  We flagged down server and he agreed that the mayo sauce was great with the calamari.  In fact, it was a  vast improvement.  They should just serve both sauces with the calamari.  Or ditch the marinara altogether.    When our entrees arrived, bf was pleased with the mix of onion rings, fries and sweet potato fries served with the burger.The burger was cooked to order and similar to a patty melt.  My quesadilla, while not Mexican restaurant quality, was decent for the environment.  It was tasty and I appreciated the sides of sour cream, avocado and salsa it came with.    Our server was attentive throughout the meal and checked in on us occasionally.  He offered dessert, but we were too stuffed.  Overall, we had a great experience.  I enjoy Keegan's as a neighborhood pub spot, but I like Wally's better. We'll be back for sure.

Baker's is a great neighborhood nursery!  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful.  They sell quality plants and other garden products.  Last time I was in was to pick up some fertilizer to feed my trees at my new home.  I've never been through this process before and was a bit intimidated.  But the staff pointed me in the right direction and educated me about application, so I'm well on my way to yummy figs, oranges, lemons and pecans next year.  You could go to Home Depot or Lowe's but you won't get the same kind of expert service you will get at Bakers.  Support your local businesses!

Seriously, their happy hour prices can't be beat.  A beer, a spicy tuna roll, calamari and avocado egg roll for under $20 including tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We had to lurk around the bar area for awhile to get a table, but that only speaks to how popular this place is.  If you are looking for an inexpensive dinner out that doesn't involve Denny's or Olive Garden this is a great choice.

So for a number of reasons that I won't go into, we got a free pizza delivered from Joe's the other night for dinner.  Half pepperoni, half chicken pesto.  I was highly unimpressed.  Even after I lowered my expectations due to the fact that it was delivered and free.    The pizza was cold.  Crust was bland and rather cardboard-ish.  The cheese was waxy.  Toppings were not very flavorful.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a free meal.  However, a free meal is always an opportunity to get or keep a customer.  Based on the pizza I wouldn't order again.

This place was just ok.  My boyfriend loves their chicken enchiladas.  We were with a party of five and were given our choice of seating when we walked in.  However, I should have known that I wasn't in store for a 5 star experience when the server who was "seating" us just walked away when we chose the table we wanted.  I was left standing there wondering if he was going to go get menus and then seat us or if we were supposed to just go sit down.  Kind of awkward.    Food was also just average.  The bf still enjoyed his chicken enchiladas.  I should also add that he initially ordered the wrong enchilada plate and when it came to the table the server was very accommodating about taking it back and getting the correct entree.  I had the carnitas taco special which was two tacos with rice and beans.  I specifically asked about what kind of tortillas the tacos were made with and the server said they were hard shell tacos.  When they arrived the tortillas were corn, greasy and soft.  Not so good.  My mom's soft tacos were strangely served upside down.  I was also the only at the table who was served refried rather than whole beans.  Not sure if that was part of the special, but thought it was kind of strange.    I loved that they served sopapillas with dinner.  Prices are reasonable and service was fair.  It was an ok experience but with other better places I don't know that I would choose to go back.

My boyfriend and I stopped by Grimaldi's at the end of a long workday that left both of us unwilling to cook dinner.  I had eaten at a location in Chandler before but that was for a rehearsal dinner so I'm not sure if I had a typical Grimaldi's experience.    We entered the restaurant and were immediately greeted and seated at a two top by the window.  The menu is printed on the placemat and there are plates already placed before you are seated.  I don't mind the placemat menus so much but then why the plates?  You just have to move them to read the menu and on a two top there isn't a ton of room to begin with.  Additionally, there are a LOT of tables packed into that dining room, but that really didn't bother us until we got up to leave.  Walking out was like traveling through an obstacle course.    After we sat, we checked out the menu and the waiter came to take our drink order.  He came back with our drinks quickly and explained the three different pizza options available.  I ordered the white with sausage and my boyfriend had the classic with pepperoni.  Once our pizzas arrived (we didn't wait long), we again had to deal with table space issues.  We each ordered a personal size pie, I think it was 12".  Our plates were stacked in the middle of the table so we could read the menu, so the server placed our pies in front of us.  At this point the plates were just table decoration.  There is no way we could have used them and put our pizzas to the side.  Not really a major issue but not as smooth as it could have been.    Once we got settled in with the table, we dove in to the pizzas.  I immediately noticed that the crust towards the center of my pizza was very soft and not crispy at all.  I'm not sure if that was a cooking time issue or a sauce/olive oil issue.  The pizza was still quite tasty, but would have been even more enjoyable with a crispier crust.  Cheese and meat quality were great and I really liked the smoky flavor that the coal oven gives the pizza.  I would characterize it as good but not great pizza.  My boyfriend's pizza was closer to great.  From the crust to the sauce to the pepperoni, this pie was spot on.  Everything was very flavorful, especially the sauce. The cheese wasn't too heavy and the boyfriend thinks it may have been fresh mozz.  His pizza was definitely the better of the two.    The waiter came back during our meal to ask about drink refills and was prompt with the bill as we finished.  We took home two slices of white and I'll be glad to have it for lunch tomorrow!  The environment at Grimaldi's is definitely family friendly and good for groups, so I wouldn't suggest it if you are looking for something intimate or quiet.  A beer, soda, two pizzas and tip totaled 39 bucks.  We felt that was a decent price for dinner.  We enjoyed Grimaldi's and would recommend it to friends!

Thank you Yelpers for helping us find dinner tonight!  We are staying at a friend's apartment in Tempe and don't really know the area in terms of places with good food that deliver.  New China Gate definitely qualifies.  We ordered a ton of food so we could eat family style.  We had the sesame beef (flavorful and crunchy), orange chicken (spicy and tender), pork fried rice (fresh and tasty) and kung pao shrimp (shrimp were cooked perfectly and lots of chunky vegetables).  We also ordered three spring rolls which were gigantic.  They looked more like mini burritos than the typical spring roll.  They were good as well with fresh veg, shrimp and chicken as the stuffing. The total was 48 bucks, which is well worth it considering we'll have left overs for days.  Service was friendly and prompt.  They quoted us a 40 minute wait and food was here in 20 minutes.  Another nice touch were the supplies for take out (sauce packets, plastic ware, fortune cookies, etc) that were packed individually in ziploc bags.  We'd definitely recommend New China Gate for delivery and are curious to eat in at their restaurant.

Two colleagues and I visited this place for lunch today.  Only a so-so experience.  I have been to Via de many, many times having grown up in the Sunnyslope area.  They have consistently had good food and great margaritas.  But today's experience will make it tough to recommend.  We were seated promptly and had waters and chips and salsa soon thereafter.  We took some time to look at the menu and decided on 2 MaryLou's with red sauce and a green corn tamale.  They were all lunch specials that came with our choice of rice and beans.  The food arrived within about 10 minutes and everybody enjoyed their meal.    My major gripe about this place was the service.  Once our meals were delivered we didn't see a server again.  I had to stop a staff member who was passing by to get some water refills (we were all down to less than 1/2" inch of water in our already small glasses).  No one came by to check and see if we were enjoying our meals or if we needed anything else to complete the meal.  When we were ready to leave, we had to go up to the front to get our bill and a to go box.  Via de is a place where you pay at the register but I still expect the bill to at least be dropped off.  They didn't appear to be exceptionally busy and I saw customers at two other tables looking around for someone to assist them.  Bad, bad service.  I don't know that I would head back when there are plenty of great Mexican food places in town with much better service.

Thanks to Yelp, I finally decided to try this place out.  I had driven past this place a million times but was less than impressed by the strip mall so I was hesitant to try it.  I've been missing out on some seriously good pizza.  We ordered a 16" pizza with mushrooms and half sausage/half pepperoni.  We picked up rather than delivery because it is in the neighborhood and they said there would be a $3 delivery charge.  It was ready in about 20 minutes and the service was great.  After we got the pizza home, we dove in and it was fantastic.  The crust was crispy but still chewy.  The tomato sauce was flavorful with out being too spicy or sweet.  I was glad to see that they used fresh mushrooms rather than canned.  The pepperoni was more flavorful than the sausage.  We thought the sausage would be better in chunk form or thicker slices.  The thing that I especially appreciated was that the entire layer of topping didn't slide off the crust when you took a bite.  We will be back to this place again and are thrilled to have a great neighborhood pizza joint.

Mucho Gusto is a great little taqueria!  I've been there a few times before for dinner and drinks, but last night it was me and the ladies for margaritas.  Mucho Gusto was actually our second choice for the evening as Mill ave was packed with those silly Sun Devil fans (Bear Down!).  We each had a couple margaritas and munched on chips and salsa.  I really appreciate that they brought out a few bowls of salsa for the table so you don't have to reach for the drippy stuff across the table.  Chips were perfectly crispy and salty.  The margaritas were delicious and tasted homemade rather that the result of a store bought mix.  Service was friendly, but less than attentive.  We had to wait a bit for drink refills and when the server cleared our chips and salsa to bring fresh, he never brought the fresh chips or salsa.  Mucho Gusto has a great patio which is apparently dog friendly.  Another customer had his two dogs there.   I'm all about pet friendly, but these dogs were roaming the patio off leash.  Kind of strange for their owner and the staff to allow that.  Oh well, I suppose it just made it seem more authentically Mexican!

So when my sweet boyfriend sent me a text that said meet me at Dozo for sushi, I was a little nervous.  I'm very hesitant to try a new sushi place, mostly cause I'm just a big-baby-scaredy-cat.   But I put on my big girl pants and met the man at Dozo.    From the minute I walked in the door, I was charmed.  No screaming loud music?  No 19 year olds serving a food they likely know nothing about?  No scenesters to be found?  Dozo, I'm in love.    We started with edamame, which was steamed perfectly, very flavorful and lightly salted.  Then we moved on to the Crunchy California roll and a two-piece order of sake (salmon).  Both were delicious, but the sake in particular melted in my mouth.  Next came the caterpillar roll which was tasty, but a little loosely rolled for my taste.  Then a delicious unagi.  Then the bf wanted to order more, I didn't know if I could possibly eat anymore but he agreed to ask the friendly chef for a recommendation.  (Side-note: I love doing this, you get the most unexpected, delicious surprises when you turn a chef loose at his craft.)  What we got in return was the most perfect end to our meal: a spicy tuna roll, with tuna and avocado layered across the top, with a citrus sauce, unagi sauce and all those yummy crunchy bits sprinkled around it.  All of that plus two large Kirins and a flask of sake for about 60 bucks including tax and tip.    This place is clean, family run and very friendly.  Service was prompt and the chef was more than willing to educate us about what he was making or what was on the menu.  It was quiet in the restaurant with maybe only three or four other people in the place, but it was a Monday night.  Plus I like it that way....so shhhhh!  Even better....it is in the neighborhood.  We'll be back....often.

Last Sunday, the man and I headed out to get breakfast, enjoy some coffee and have a lazy read of the day's paper.  He wanted to take to me to the place he stops at many mornings on his way to work, but alas, it wasn't open until 11am.  (Side note: A coffee shop that doesn't open til 11am?  On a Sunday?  Really?)  We looked at each with blank faces.  Where to go now?  We needed breakfast, coffee, wireless internet and a place where we could relax without feeling like we were preventing a server from turning the table.    So I said, "What about that little shack place further south on Scottsdale Rd.? You know the one that says coffee, breakfast, lunch on the sign outside."  He said something along the lines of, "You're a f*$@ing genius."  His colleague had apparently been recommending this place for weeks and he hadn't tried it yet.  D'lish as it turned out to be called, was exactly what we were looking for.   As we walked up to the front door, we passed a lovely but small patio.  I was instantly charmed.  All along the patio are planters with homegrown tomatoes, herbs and other yummy garden delights.    When we walked in we checked out the menu and waited our turn.  Not sure who helped us but I'm assuming the two guys who we spoke with during our visit are Chad and Kyle.  The bf and I ordered the same thing: two breakfast croissants and two lattes.  The latte was great and satisfied the Sunday morning coffee craving.   The breakfast croissant?  Just delicious.  A fried egg, bacon and tomato with a light layer of pesto on the croissant.  Seriously delicious.  I don't know if I ever would have thought of pesto on an egg sandwich but I'm so glad that D'lish has broadened my culinary horizons.    The bf was equally satisfied with his meal, but did remark that he thought $6 was a bit expensive for a breakfast sandwich.  I think we paid a reasonable price for a quality product.  It is apparent to me that with a limited menu stocked with fresh ingredients, a garden on the patio and their status as a CSA drop off point, D'lish is trying to churn out food that is as fresh, natural, local and organic as possible.  Yay for them.    Chad and Kyle were nothing but friendly and welcoming.   A number of regulars came through while we were there and it was obvious they have quite a loyal following.  D'lish is small, no more than 20 or 30 could fit in the place.  However, they also have a drive thru to serve customers on the run.  We'll be back and hope to be regulars soon!

I went here today for a pedi and was pleased with the experience.  I live a short distance away but didn't even know Paulene's existed before reading about it on yelp.  I went on Saturday morning and was the first customer there.  The ladies that work in this shop are friendly and courteous.  They speak English well enough to be easily understood which I appreciate.  The nail tech that waited on me made small talk at first but then let me read my magazine in peace which is one of my favorite parts of getting a pedicure.    I got a French pedicure so the cost was $25 before tip.  Let me restate what another poster mentioned.  They accept credit cards but have no tip line on the receipt to add tip.  Be sure to have a few bucks in cash to tip because they can't add it to the total.    The pedicure I got was great and the nail tech was attentive and always asked if things were ok (water temp, nail length, etc).  The hot stone massage is not a myth.  Not only did the nail tech give me a regular leg massage with lotion (which was one of the best I've had), then she follows it up with hot stones.  That was just lovely.  Overall I am pleased with this place and excited to try it out for a mani and pedi one day soon.

Wanna go to Mexico but too broke in this economy to make the trip?  Well then take yourself on over to Huauchinango.  Named after a city in the southern Mexican state of Puebla, you will absolutely feel like you have left the US and gone south of the border.  Unlike most of the "Mexican" restaurants in this city, this one actually has Mexicans as customers.  While I have only had the egg, chorizo and potato burrito, I feel comfortable recommending the food across the board.  The burrito is excellent from egg to tortilla to chorizo, very high quality.  And the green salsa is outstanding.   There are fountain drinks, but also a case of Mexican juices and sodas as well.  The menu is written in Spanish with English translation.  The staff is super friendly, English speaking and happy to make recommendations or explain any unfamiliar items.  The environment is low key but clean and comfortable.    I owe the boyfriend big time for discovering this gem.

A family friend gave me a gift certificate for a free haircut with Damian.  I'm broke, I'm a teacher, I like free stuff and my hair was in a mighty sad state.  I called and made an appointment for the next day.  Whoever answered the phone was friendly and accomodating and gave me excellent directions to the shop.    When I arrived at the shop the next day, I was a little unsure.  Snapdragon is in a nondescript, mostly vacant office complex.  It is in the back part of the complex and has no street visibility or signage.  In fact, aside from a for lease sign on the front of the building there is no signage at all.  But, again, I'm broke, a teacher and my hair sucked.  So I parked and walked in.  The minute I opened the door my worries were completely wiped away.  The shop is small, intimate, well decorated, warm and welcoming.  The staff was friendly and greeted me with an offer of a beverage (I opted for the wine).    After a couple minute wait (I was early), Damian fetched me from the comfy couch and brought me back to his station.  He was friendly and funny without being pushy or obnoxious.  He took time to talk to me about my "hair history" and what I wanted to do today.  He was sure to ask me not just about length but style too (rock and roll or classic and conservative).  I was just there for a cut but we also discussed color options for a future visit and I was glad to learn we were on the same page with our ideas.  I was ready for a change so I let him cut off about 4-5 inches of my hair.  This is a big deal for a first time client experience.  Damian delivered.  He took his time and made sure everything was perfect before he let me out of the chair.  I love my hair, my mom loves my hair, my boyfriend loves my hair and my students love my hair.    Snapdragon uses bumble and bumble products which I can't afford so to me that was a luxiourous treat.  I like this little shop.  I believe they also have a manicurist, but not sure about aesthetician services.  I'll be back in a month or two for another cut and color!

To celebrate our anniversary, the boyfriend and I ventured out to Mastro's City Hall for dinner.  Do not let the businesslike exterior fool you...this is a beautiful, fine dining restaurant.    Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess and escorted to our table.  Didn't have a chance to check out the patio or bar, but I will say the dining room is gorgeous.  Low, but not dark, lighting.  Music piped in from the piano in the lounge, I believe??  Tables that seem packed in the room but have plenty of room between to allow you to move around.  We were seated at a two top, which I usually do not like, especially when there are fours available.  I understand why restaurants do this, but the tables are usually so small that we run out of room quickly.  This table, however, had more than enough space.  As the hostess seated us, she asked us what color napkin we'd prefer, black or white.  Never experienced that before.  I'm sure there is some sort of fancy-schmancy etiquette rule about which napkin is better, but we aren't really fancy-schmancy people.  We stuck with the white napkins that were already on the table.    Next we were given menus and greeted by the server who asked about a drink order.  I asked for water while I perused the wine list and the bf had a jack and coke.  What the waiter returned with was a water and a glass of jack (nearly full) and a bottle of coke.  A jack with a splash of coke just like he likes them.  The bf was happy.    Let me cover the service aspect of our evening.  Our server was awesome.  Very professional, educated and willing to educate us first timers on the menu and specials.  He made an excellent wine recommendation and helped us choose the apps for our seafood tower.  Additionally, it was also election night and we debated even going out as opposed to staying in and watching the returns.  But, the server kept us updated with results on a regular basis from the bar tv.  Yay!  Back up staff was generally good about filling water, clearing tables, etc.  But sometimes it felt like we were being rushed.  Staff approached the table to see if we were finished when we were obviously still eating.  Like actually chewing with food still on the plate.  Nothing too major, but I would expect better here.  Ok, food...We had the seafood tower (shrimp, oysters, lobster), filets, asparagus and....wait for it, wait for it....the lobster mashed potatoes!  The seafood tower made a dramatic entrance complete with dry ice.  Again the server was very accommodating and helpful.  He made great recommendations and basically was able to create this dish as we wanted it.  Everything was delicious and the creamy mustard sauce was phenomenal.  I would choose that over cocktail sauce anytime.  I had the petite filet and the bf had the regular.  Both were cooked perfectly and melted in our mouths.  Also, the bf's steak seemed much larger than 12 oz.  Asparagus was bright green, firm but tender.  If you read the reviews here, people are raving about the potatoes.  With good reason...they are delectable.  Ridiculously good.  Seriously, my mouth is watering right now.  Do not fret if you don't see them on the menu.  They are a special item that they almost always have.  We paired a bottle of Cab with our entree which was very nice as well.  After dinner was cleared, we gladly boxed up our leftover mashers (seriously it could serve 4 easily).  I thought we were ready to go, but out came a slice of delicious chocolate cake as a treat for our anniversary.  We didn't order this, they just brought it out.  Regardless of what kind of restaurant you are at, this is always a nice touch.  Even with our best efforts there was no way we were going to finish the cake so after a few bites that went in a box as well.    In spite of the earlier rushed feeling, once we finished our meal we were left alone to finish our drinks.  This was easily one of the best meals I've ever had.  It is spendy, so we won't be back often.  But we will be back again and be recommending it to all our friends.    ps...the bf paid so I can't really complain, but those take home boxes??  They made it home, but I've never seen them again. :)

As a Phoenix native, there are a number of places in the Valley that are quintessentially Phoenix to me.  I've visited many of them and love them just as much as the next desert dweller.  But every now and then I have pangs of guilt and inadequacy over having never been to a place that everybody else identifies as a Phoenix institution.  Like I'm an impostor and haven't really earned my Phoenix stripes yet because I haven't visited Carolina's or Ranch Market or Pete's Fish and Chips.   Well, my Phoenix cred just ratcheted up a notch or so with my visit to Pete's Fish and Chips on Indian School and 44th Street.  This place has been here forever.  I've seen the bumper stickers (I'm addicted to Pete's Fish and Chips!) on the back of cars since, oh I don't know, birth??  It is a family owned business with a friendly, but no frills attitude.  There are all kinds of rules and restrictions, but that keeps the prices at amazingly low levels.  If you go to Pete's, keep the following in mind....Bring cash, its all they take.  Also, know that the sauce they serve is a spicy red sauce similar to cocktail sauce.  They have tartar sauce on hand but you have to request it.    We ordered a 4 piece fish and chips and a 10 piece shrimp and chips.  I picked it up at the drive thru and brought it home.  Honestly, I was a bit worried about this scenario because I thought I might run the risk of having the food be cold and soggy by the time I got home.  And really, what's worse than cold fish and chips??  Luckily, I don't live too far away and the food was still piping hot 10 minutes after we unwrapped and started eating.    The fish was crisp, flaky and delicious.  Very good with the red sauce.  I wouldn't say that this type of fish and chips is representative of the British pub style meal.  It is more in the style of beach shack dining on the East Coast.  The shrimp were less than impressive, 90% breading, 10% shrimp.  Don't think we'll order that again.  Chips were standard fare.  Nothing impressive, but they did the job.  The total for the two meals was $14.02.  Just the right price in this economy.  And even better?  Pete's is the kind of place where if you pay that bill with a $20, they just go ahead and give you $6 back in change.  No messing with a handful of coins.  We'll be back to Pete's when the f'n'c craving hits us.  Glad to have it in the neighborhood.
