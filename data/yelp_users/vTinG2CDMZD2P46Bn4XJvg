This location is close to where I live so I've used them a few times over the years. Today I was fed up with the sales tactics of another eye care center and randomly stopped in here to see if I could get some help figuring out my pupillary distance. I was greeted with friendly service and received my measurement with nothing expected in return. I'll definitely be coming back when I need my next eye exam.

When you first walk into Cupcakes you're greeted by silence and the bakery's dark (they only turn on a couple of lights and those for the counter in the back of the shop) cheesy aqua decor. The cupcakes are on display about a foot behind a hanging protective Plexiglas, although it doesn't provide a lot of protection at that distance. Under each kind of cupcakes is a taped-on paper label and on the wall above is a full menu explaining each variety. Don't count on any help or suggestions from the staff (AKA the owner) because, at almost $4 per cupcake, apparently she is doing YOU a favor. This especially when she boxes your cupcakes with her bare hand.  I ordered the Skinny Mini (vegan lemon), Hollywood (red velvet), Vanilla w/Chocolate Chips, and a Party Animal. I enjoyed the Skinny Mini. It had good flavor and texture and I really liked that it was a vegan option. The Hollywood was also good. It reminded me of my own recipe. The vanilla cake and party animal were terrible. Both were a crumbly, flavorless mess. The cupcakes are pricey and risky and the service was not satisfactory. I will be keeping a far distance from Cupcakes. Well actually I'll be a mile down the street at Sprinkles, where I've never had a bad cupcake and the service makes me feel valued.

I love this place! The owner is an awesome guy who's usually there during the day, making sure all the food is wonderful. They make some of the best chili I've ever had. The beef sandwiches (I get them with hot peppers and cheddar) and the cheeseburgers are must haves. All the food is cooked fresh within sight! I crave this place on a daily basis and I usually end up going 3-4 times a week. The prices aren't bad, a little pricey for myself (a broke, hungry college student) but the portions are always generous. I would take a star off because they don't have milkshakes (and I would sure love a good milkshake with this food) but everything else is so good that giving only four stars wouldn't do it justice!

LOVE THIS PLACE. Got two bucks cash and a need for an ice cream sandwich? This is the place to be.  My friend and I come here about once a week to get our fix and never leave disappointed. Even the one time we got there just after closing, on my friend's birthday, they opened the door and allowed us to buy their last creations of the night.   Couldn't be happier to have Slickables on Mill!

I'm a sucker for habit but breaking free from my usual spot down the street, I tried Big Boys Pizza today. I walked in and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. The small dining room is clean, quiet, well themed and upbeat. There are two flat-screens mounted for your enjoyment. One can hear pizza sizzle and toppings being chopped from their seat as they wait for their order.  I felt like I was back home at the family pizza joint.   Cheap, quick, easy, enormously sliced and flavorful, this New York style pizza was just what I was craving. The menu features a comprehensive selection of toppings and specials. The staff isn't afraid to make suggestions or adjust their specials to your wallet's benefit. Though the prices are on par with with the lower-tier pizza chains, the quality of the pie is up there with the best of the valley. I honestly can't wait to order their 28'' Big Boy pizza for my next party.  My only gripe was the $5 minimum required for credit/debit transactions. I've noticed many business implementing this policy but there are many companies that have developed technology to ease this issue i.e. Paypal Here, Square. I'll just have to remember to bring cash next time.  Keep in mind: Big Boys also delivers.
