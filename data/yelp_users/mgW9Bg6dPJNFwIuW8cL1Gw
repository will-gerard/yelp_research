I ordered a cheeseburger, a chicken sand which and a lg cheese fry. It came out to $16. When I go and pick it up and all ready pay the guy asks me what would I like to drink. Wtf! I ordered 2 sandwiches and a fry not 2 meals. I payed for more than I wanted, don't wanted drinks, so instead of refunding the money for the meals I did not ordered they just give me 2 large fry,s and one little thing of cheese that cost a dollar. I tried this place cuz it's closer than Wendy's. For now on I'm going to drive the extra mile to get Wendy's or something.

Love Raquel the Host. we call for reservations and even thought it was not busy she saved us a both. My girl and I asked her what favorite app is and Raquel said you have to try the Coconut shrimp so we did and guess what its addicting. For entrees try the Pollo fundido, and the Chimy. :-)  love this place Noah & Steph.
