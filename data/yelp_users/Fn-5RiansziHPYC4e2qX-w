What a great hidden gem in old town Scottsdale!  Orange Table offers a great mix of flavors like the jalape√±o pancakes (sounds bizarre, but out of this world amazing) all while using local fair and offering a layed back atmosphere.  If you are looking for a casual breakfast spot any day of the week to sip a morning cocktail and enjoy great food and service, this is the spot!

I've been coming here since 2003.  I have an out of warranty VW and only trust LeSueur with my car.  Service/labor prices beat any dealership in the area.  They are honest, friendly and a pleasure to do business with.  Ask for Ken in service, he's great!

This place is awesome!  Great happy hour, great brunch Sat & Sun, great neighborhood spot all around and the patio is dog friendly!  Food is always delicious and some of the best beer selections in town (they have some crazy amount of offerings on tap).    I hosted a party here on their front patio, great space!  The catering menu's are a great option for groups and everything is just as delicious as the regular menu items.  The staff was amazing in the planning process making a point to sit down with me one-on-one to put a menu together and see that my vision was carried out.  For this particular event, I had some specific requests and without  flinching an eye, was taken care of.  On the day of the party, the room was set and the service was nothing short of fabulous.  Love this place!  OHSO staff=Rockstars!

Buzz kill!  It was 3p and there was only 4 varieties, all of which were basic and underwhelming.  Thinking they were closing soon, I asked what their hours where.  After commenting on the sparse assortment, and finding out there is no cooking on site, the clerk said "there might be more coming from another store".  I also inquired about the ingredients, wanting to know more about the quality of ingredients used.  The gal replied with "she didn't' know" since she didn't cook them.  Give me a break!  Product knowledge, especially when it comes to food is standard.  Most bakeries are known for something; using organic ingredients, having a signature cake, ect.    I ended up with chocolate.  At 3.50 a pop, it had way too much frosting,  cake was dry could be compared to a Safeway bakery cupcake, just more presentable.  I'll take a sprinkles cupcake any day where at least you know your getting top of the line ingredients and almost always have a great selection of flavors.

I like this type of place exists in east valley suburbia.  But I wasn't impressed, especially being an Upward concept.  This was my first time visiting.  Food was good, overpriced for the demographic  and offerings in my option, but a nice selection of options no less.  The service on the other hand, terrible.  We had to continually ask for drinks until we took matters into our own hands and went to the bar directly.  This shouldn't be the case when your seated in the dining area.  Waiter didn't follow up when the food arrived, and a side of salsa that was requested when the order went in, took asking 4 times!    I will drive the extra mile to visit other Upward concepts, but wouldn't patron this place again based on the service experience, or really, lack there of.

A must try!  Service, impeccable.  Food, fabulous. Overall, impressive.  This James Beard award gem is a culinary delight.  With a quaint European vibe, the menus offerings are seasonal.  They offer hand crafted cocktails and a nice wine pairing selection. We started with a "trio" a pick three selection of tapas, followed by entrees.  Everything we tried was amazing!  This is one of my new favorite places in Scottsdale, looking forward to going again soon.

Delicious!  I've had this spot on my to do list forever.  I finally tried it over the weekend and boy was I missing out.  Simply amazing!  I've only ever had a pasty when I've been in the UK...and I may go as far as saying, it's better than what I experienced in Britain.  Modestly priced, great beer, and a large menu selection, including a full vegetarian menu offering the use of Quorn meatless products.  The atmosphere is modern pub with a nice relaxed ambiance.  I love how this spot offers traditional English eats with a culinary twist.  The cottage pie and tikka masala pasty was scrumptious!

Service is HORRENDOUS!  Went for dinner.  They don't take reservations, was told the wait would be 20 minutes for a table.  Non issue.  Then, it began.  The hostess was put off by everything; God forbid this be her job!  We opted to sit on the patio while we waited for our table.  We sat, sat some more and finally after 30 minutes, we got our cocktail and don't see the waitress again.  No joke!  Mind you, the 20 minute window we were quoted has since expired for our table.  Waitress went MIA.  Wowed by the stellar service, we went to the bar to close as we no longer had desire to stay for dinner, to be told they couldn't help because we were seated in a service area.  Still no sign of the waitress, and still no seat for dinner after an hour wait.  Can we say fail?!
