Sure, their branding is nice. It has that feel of something hip and youthful, which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local. Pretty colors and shiny things however don't impress my palate.  I can't explain how much I detest food from Zoe's. Fresh vegetables, grilled meats -- it should be a slam dunk. Instead, their food is BLAND. It is the inverse of food, it is anti-food, annihilating the satisfaction of eating with every bite.

Yes, hot tip you have to ask for the full menu. Second hot tip, learn to say "hello" in Mandarin (pronounced nee-how) and likely you won't HAVE to ask for the full menu.   We've dined here several times, and on Sunday, not surprisingly, we were the only non-Asian customers in the place. The chef was in rare form, and as I sit here having my third round of leftovers for lunch I'm still loving my dish. I opted for the Vinegar Fish, it's pretty simple -- whitefish, wood ear mushrooms and water chestnuts prepared with a dose of spice and rice wine vinegar. I'm guessing by the waitress' excitement when I ordered, that it's a dish they're pretty proud of. It was fabulous.  Hubby ordered the Beef and Onions, which I would classify as good, but not mind-blowing. We also partook of the Gai-choy which was cooked perfectly -- just the right amount of garlic and tenderness.   In the past I've really loved their Mapo Doufu (tofu), theirs is one of the best I've had anywhere. Next time I'm planning on having the Water-Boiled Eel. I heart eel, mmm.  Service is pretty barebones, so don't expect to be sucked-up to. It's perfunctory and efficient, the food comes up fast and they leave you alone. I can't complain about that one bit.

I love Hanratty's -- it strikes a balance between dive bar and neighborhood watering hole. Nothing fancy, just a good place to sidle up to after a long night. The bar staff is awesome, the jukebox plays pretty much whatever you want, and the drinks are strong. Hanratty's is a textbook bar.

This is great place to have a healthy meal for a decent price. Salad fixins are all super fresh, and there are so many to choose from. The soups that I tried, the chicken noodle and creamy tomato, were as good as any homemade soup I've had. This really is more like 3.5 stars for me, but I give it the bump for the soft-serve ice cream machine -- not to mention the warm snicker-doodle cookies they brought to our table.

Is this a gourmet restaurant? No, it's a bit of a dive. Is this my own personal cafeteria? Yes. I live here, I spend so much money in this store that my Quicken thinks Chuy's is a bill.  Chuy's keeps me nourished with grilled fish and meats, healthy beans, all-you-can eat chips and the best mild pico de gallo this side of the Border. Throw in cheap margaritas, nightly meal specials and the AWESOME friendly staff and it's easy to see how Chuy's maintains loyalty with its devoted fans. At $20 for drinks and dinner for two, I will weep buckets of tears if Chuy's ever goes away.   My only complaint is they really could use an overhaul on the bathroom, it's just a wee bit dumpy.

Ate here for lunch the other day, food was pretty meh. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could, the spring rolls were very nice and stuffed with shrimp. However, the order of chicken I had was completely dried out -- it was seriously like eating chalk. The flavor was ok, I guess, but the meat was so overcooked it was impossible to really tell.

My client and I will occasionally loiter on the patio for afternoon meetings at Busters. The location is nice, it's a cute little spot next to the "lake." As I've never eaten in the restaurant, my review will only cover the patio and bar app menu. So in no particular order, my observations.   The patio needs more umbrellas, or perhaps a nice solar sail. Western exposure in the afternoon ... need I say more? The clientele around us was rather ... entertaining (yes, sorry I know that's snarky). It was an odd mix of bridge club and bar star.  The waitstaff is friendly enough, but during slow afternoon hours is busy with side work and tends to forget about you. I had to go inside to get my first drink since I missed her when everyone else ordered.    The beer selection is very good, but the food is pretty bland. My last visit we ordered the artichoke dip with chips. There were not enough chips to go around for three people, and the dip was rather mealy. I've had better dip from Costco.  I wouldn't go there on my on volition, but it's okay for a meeting.

Razz's is among my favorite places in the Valley. The food is impeccable, the wine list superb. I can't pick a favorite item, though I'm a sucker for the short ribs. FYI, I know Razz can do terrific vegetarian entrees, and according to the menu, they will create one for you on request. Razz's catered my wedding, and even I, a devout omnivore, opted for the meatless dish. Three years later, people still talk about the food at our wedding.

Been eating here, and all their sister properties for years. I'll write more when I'm feeling more verbose, but had to quibble. THIS IS NOT TEX-MEX!!!! Hello Yelp, are you asleep at the switch on this? It's New Mexican, get it right. Calling it Tex-Mex is totally insulting to people from New Mexico. It would be like saying that Japanese and Chinese food is the same because they both use a lot of rice.

I despise the lack of half stars on these reviews. I dig The Vig, but I'm not sure I can say I 4-star dig The Vig (it's really close though).  We've been frequenting The Vig since they opened, yet another destination spot in the neighborhood. Let me tell you how excited I am that their Central location is siphoning off some of the customers ... it's slightly less crazy up in there. Yes, I'm a curmudgeon, I admit it.  The Vig's food, though a little limited in options, is all fresh and satisfying. Sunday I had the grilled chicken sandwich with the mixed fries. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the veggies crisp and everything competently prepared. Big props especially for the $5 Bloody Marys ... it's what earned them that 4th full star. Just the right amount of spice and not too boozy.  We usually visit for dinner, and my husband was convinced they did brunch on Sundays. They do not. However, they did have one special "breakfast" sandwich, or you can get the burger with an egg on it for an a.m. protein fix.

16th used to be a ritual lunch place for a girlfriend and I. It's a good sized bar, tucked in the back of a nondescript mini-plaza. The crowd is Phoenix "diverse" -- blue-collars and insurance sales types. Trucks and mid-luxury sedans dot the parking lot.  For pub fare, their food is quite good. The fish and chips are delightful, big pieces of fish fried puffy and brown. And the quesadilla is actually noteworthy, if not for the size, than for the chipotle sour cream served on the side.   The service has always been prompt and friendly, and the atmosphere convivial. All in all a good spot for lunch or an after-work drink.

I've been eating at this location pretty regularly since they opened it. What's not to like about Wildflower? The bread is terrific, I'm especially a fan of the $2 Dough to Go baguettes that blow doors off of anything from the other local bakeries.   While the bread itself is great, my passion is the Grilled Turkey Pastrami. The first time I ordered this sandwich, I almost sent it back not realizing it had the "Wildflower Coleslaw," which just looked too busy for my palate. However, it turns out to be the secret ingredient, with its white raisins, cabbage, and jicama providing a sweet and crunchy texture to the perfectly seasoned turkey pastrami.   My favorite part of dining at Wildflower? It's a local company. Yes, it's all sexy and looks corporate like a Panera Bread or Paradise Bakery, but it's an AZ company that contributes to the community. It's nice to know that if I get a gross sammi I can march up to Scottsdale and throw it at the CEO's head.

A chef that can do great things with brussels sprouts always get major points with me, second only to one that can make creamy soups not laden with cream. Mark Tarbell does both exceptionally.   On our last visit, I broke tradition of ordering the special of the night and opted for the chicken. Yes, big deal one thinks ... think again. There is something magical in that bird, a perfect balance of salt and crispiness. When available, I go ga-ga for the lamb with brussels sprouts and french lentils. Another must is the duck confit appetizer. Heaven.   I typically don't bother with the pizza -- it is good, but not really an attraction. The by-the-glass list has several good selections, including a very well priced sparkling. The waitstaff is efficient, professional and friendly, something of a rarity even among many "upper echelon" establishments in the Valley. Yes, parking can be a bitch at that plaza, and yes, parts of the menu are a tad bit weather worn ... but sometimes there is nothing wrong with a little comfort food.

Warning number one: let me start this review by saying beware all those from the East side -- this is not the same as Kabuki in Tempe.   Our experience at Kabuki was disappointing to me, especially after I chose the restaurant based on Yelp reviews.   Seating was prompt and pleasant for our party of five. It was an early meal, and the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived. Our waiter had his hands full, and, to his credit, we were a table of 3 sushi amateurs and 2 sushi snobs all vying for his attention. Despite this bonus credit, he was very "first day on the job."   We ordered a few apps, including the gyoza and misos. The gyoza was well received and the misos were standard issue.   Next on to the courses, the timing of which was horrible. We made it very clear to the waiter that two of us would be having sushi as our main, and the rest would be having entrees. Unfortunately, this was completely disregarded resulting in a gap so large that the person with the first entree served was nearly finished when the last entree arrived. Not sure if this was a wait staff or kitchen issue, either way it was problematic and a HUGE peeve of mine.  In the midst of all this the specialty rolls we ordered, the Hawaiian and the Caterpillar, were served -- along with the eel, salmon roe and tuna rolls. The straight sushi was very good -- the tuna was fresh, the roe not fishy. The eel was a bit drier than what I would prefer, but the flavor was spot on -- not cloyingly sweet or over sauced.  Unfortunately, the specialty rolls were so vile I actually had to be "that" person and send them back. It was a shame, as they looked stunning and were very generous portions. But ... this brings us to warning number two -- Crabmeat on their menu actually means Krab meat -- as in the imitation stuff, and not just in the California roll where we all expect it (and I can avoid it). It seems to make an appearance in ALL of their specialty rolls -- complete with mayo. Yuck.  Now, I realize every place has their own spin, but frankly I found the whole thing to be appalling -- I've never seen a Caterpillar roll that includes Krab. And the Hawaiian just made sense to have real crab, given the other ingredients.   The hostess or manager, not sure who she was but nonetheless lending a hand, was very gracious in accommodating a prompt removal of these sushi abortions and supplying additional tuna and spicy tuna rolls (which were both VERY good). I give major points to them for handling the situation well.    While I was very disappointed with my experience, it wasn't all bad. Had we not had the service issues, I likely would not have sent the sushi back, but by that point I was already getting a bit on edge. So, I won't trash the place, because god knows there aren't enough independents on that side of town, and the items done well -- particularly the spicy tuna and teriyaki  -- were very good. So my advice if you're not of the Krab loving persuasion -- stick to the basics, and you'll do alright.

My local CK. Have always encountered very friendly staff here. Gets a little hectic during the after-work rush, but usually I can get in and out with minimal fuss. I like this CK because there's not (usually) any questionable characters milling around.

Very disappointing experience. Servers unaware of specials, inconsistent attention. Waiter came to our table brought orders, left us hanging. Went in to bar and got attitude from the bar tender. She literally chucked my boyfriend's ID back at him across the bar. My annoyance with getting ignored by the server and a manager who came out to talk to our table about pricing problems, when all I wanted to do was order a drink, was palpable -- but seriously who wouldn't be annoyed. Btw, even after manager said they would take care of pricing problem, final bill didn't reflect it. This place is the pits.

I like Humble Pie. The ambiance is that trademark Arizona upscale/casual where wine swilling 40-somethings get can get a bit rowdy after a bottle or two. That's my code for don't expect a quiet dining experience, unless you go later in the evening.    The pizzas overall are quite good -- chewy crusts, balanced sauces and quality cheeses. I find the meat toppings to be a little hit or miss. It's hard to go wrong with the Schriner's Sausage, but I found the pepperoni to be a bit greasy and cut way too thick, and the prosciutto slices so large/stringy as to be a choking hazard. I refuse to use silverware to eat pizza, even in a classy pizza joint like this, so perhaps the Heimlich is in my future.   If you want to control costs, order one of their special pizzas (unless you like it super simple.) The pricing on their choose-your-own-topping pizzas can easily get out of control -- piecing together my favorite toppings resulted in a $16 pizza. Yikes!   Star-wise my review is somewhere between a 3 and 4. I'm giving Humble the bump for their Monday night half-price wine specials. The wine list has an excellent variety, and we've indulged in plenty of their top-tier bottles ... at 50 percent off, you'd be crazy not to.

DSW has become my official shoe store. I love their selection, particularly the clearance racks with the generous 40-80 percent off marked prices. I also love the equally generous Rewards program. I've already cleaned up on the welcome coupons, and I anticipate I'll be earning points rather quickly. (I think the rewards program is one of the biggest incentives to purchase here vs. other retailers.)  This is a very clean, well-organized store. Service was okay, no complaints, however my interaction with the employees was limited to just the checkout. Only downside to a store this large is it can be quite the time-suck, but then you're shopping for SHOES so who cares!

This is a solid three stars, almost four (I bumped for the hours!). I popped in here a few weeks ago to get some much needed protein before boozing it up. If you're going to ingest a plate full of fat, this is a really great way to do it. Bacon wrapped hotdogs slathered with mayo and tied together with what has to be the most amazing "bun" I've ever had. I took mine with the beans and tomatoes, hold the onions, and slopped on as much of the green salsa as I could. The dog was gone in about 30 seconds. Good stuff.

Can't believe I haven't reviewed these guys yet. Okay, yeah, read the reviews everyone raves about Charlotte. Charlotte, you reading this? We love you, don't leave!   Charlotte has been doing my 'do for about nine years, and I followed her to Embellish from her previous salon. Can't really say enough great things there -- she keeps me from looking like a she-beast.  Embellish has expanded their space to almost double the original size, and I recently indulged in a mani/pedi in the "new" digs. I enjoyed the experience immensely, though I was a little leery that they use a giant metal bowl for the foot bath. However, in the end I decided it was better than those plastic foot baths some places use. The pedi is about a full hour, and very intensive with cleansing, a mud mask and massage. My feet have never been so clean.  As far as other services, I've been in several times for brow waxing, always with excellent service and results.

"Suzie's Sadistic Healing" reads the sign hanging in her office. It was given to her by an enthusiastic client, a convert otherwise known as a masochist.   Oh yes, there is gratification from pain going down in this office.   Suzie specializes in deep-tissue massage, and, as she operates out of Camelview Physical Therapy's offices, sees many folks like myself that are as knotted up as an old-school phone cord.   For this little masochist, visiting Suzie has become a weekly ritual. Call me a glutton for punishment, but my body has never felt so good. Her work has kept me limber, helped me heal from injury and saved me a small fortune in psychotherapy.   While I go for the good scream, don't be totally afraid. I know Suzie is versatile, and will adjust pressure based on tolerance (my mom has arthritis and loves her just the same as I do). That said, this is not a spa massage -- if you want to be coddled and rubbed with stones look elsewhere.

Now that my cars are getting older, emissions testing has become a semi-regular thing. This is the only place I will go. The staff is pretty friendly, and the wait times are generally small. I also genuinely appreciate that the facilities are open until 7 p.m. I second the recommend for the myazcar website, it will tell you what the current wait time is. If only all government stuff was this easy to deal with.

Love me some Pita Jungle and have been waiting, waiting, waiting for this location to open. My chicken combo plate was great as always, staff and decor are both wins and the happy hour tapas were a nice pre-meal bite (two bites each, really). I second the other reviewer's mention on no place to put my purse at the high top tables. Also the location of their computers and the servers lined up creates a bottle neck trying to get to the front door/bathroom areas. A little design flaw in an otherwise spacious and stylish space.
