When entering thee was a funny odor - hard to describe but it was not food or spices. Hostess was pleasant, server was prompt and courteous. Appetizer and entree plates were colorful and created a nice presentation for each dish. Particularly liked if we were asked if we'd like to take a tea to go. Nice way to top off a good experience.

Sample appetizer over priced ~ service was very good and New England Clam chowder was AMAZING!

Have to say out of all the Natives we've been to this by far is the least desirable. Service....well what service? Food....maybe it will arrive soon and we can give feedback.

Love their wings - the best are the honey hot wings! Appetizer platter had a good variety . Servers in the bar area were attentive and very friendly.
