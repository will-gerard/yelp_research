Stopped in for lunch and was decently impressed with this place. Had the green curry which wasn't Thai hot like I had asked but still somewhat spicy. Was disappointed that they did not bring/have fish sauce with Thai chili peppers to add some more salty spiciness to the curry. Impressed that there was not a selection of meats for each of the curries, they are specific to each and was cooked excellently and especially tender. Looking forward to trying some more traditional Thai dishes from here again.

The St-Germain Cocktail was perfect on a warm spring day in Phoenix. You can immediately tell the quality of ingredients here is superb. Enjoyed the wide selection of French menu options from Provencial Bouillabaisse to Gascon Duck confit and Burgandy Coq au Vin.

Overwhelming wine list and everything we ate was absolutely delicious. You will have no problem finding extraordinary flavors in the food here! We ordered their cheese plate, mini-mushroom dish, pork shank, and the blondie dessert...all to die for...

Hostess service was very poor the night we went, waited over an hour past our reservation time to be seated. A mediocre dessert was complimentary for our wait. The bar had a decent selection of cocktails, but smelled of stale cleaning water. However, the entrees and appetizers were as good as it gets for this price range. The asian fusion of traditional calamari was excellent. But their special of Rib eye with hollandaise and shrimp was out of this world delicious. Very romantic setting with one of the best views in the valley. Will definitely go back again.

The smells from the kitchen are just amazing, great quality steak selection, intimate wine room for a group, and the BEST dessert in all of Phoenix. The service is a little fast for my taste at this price range, but the butter cake...you just can't say no to...

Great breakfast selection and a well sourced local and wholesome use of ingredients. The "Callejero Style" corn on the cob is one of the best items on their menu. The mesquite grill always delivers fantastic smells and titillates your taste buds. The Chilaquiles Verdes is my favorite breakfast selection, almost rivaling Chelsea's Kitchen's version...almost... Great for road and mtn. bikers.

Brunch was very disappointing, cocktails were mediocre, and there was just no atmosphere with the total of 3 people in this restaurant. Food was just average, not worth the pain of parking at this place. Does not validate and valet is $12.

The charcuterie was expansive but with an odd selection that was uncomplimentary to eachother. Do not order the calamari! Rubbery, fishy, lacking in flavor. The heirloom tomato and bolognese pastas were very average but of good portion sizes. The pork belly risotto had very over cooked pork belly unproportionaly small to the amount of risotto. The only above average dish was the langasto pasta which didn't feel worth the price. Clearly, most of the yelp reviews are from drunk Scottsdale club-goers.

Great tasting fresh bagels with exceptional espresso! Had am everything bagel with lox, was not disappointed at all with this price point. The owner is fun and talkative, outdoor seating, and hipster-esque interior are welcome additions to this quiet location near hiking and biking trails.
