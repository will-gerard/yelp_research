Had lunch here twice now and their BBQ sandwichs are very taste but definetly messy. First time I tried pork and this time I tried the chicken. Both were good. I recommend this if your in the mood for BBQ. I'm still dying to try their ribs but I don't think I could eat that much for lunch. The one thing I don't care for is their soda product. They have RC Cola! This is the only place I know that does'nt have coke or pepsi,, so I guess they are behind the times in the beverage department. But if your looking for good BBQ you should definetly try this place. Just make sure you grab some napkins!!

First time I have tried going to Outback for lunch. It wasn't very busy and now I see why. Our server name was Sabrina, she was nice but was a complete ditz. We both ordered hamburgers with no mustard. When the order came one came with mustard. When we told the waitress that the burger had mustard on it she said maybe the other burger has mustard on it? Like she got our orders mixed up and she had a look on her face like it was our fault. Never admitted that they screwed up. So she went back and got another bun. After that she never came back, she never offered us drink refills or asked how our meals were, in fact we were the only customers on that side of the restuarant and probably her only table. She might have been new but seemed to have hardly any customer service skills or serving skills.   So if you want good service I recommend not going to Outback for lunch because the service is slow, unless it was just our server who lacked skills. I don't think I will ever go back there for lunch just dinner but I hope the waiters at night are more skilled then the day servers.

Have'nt been to this location in a very long time but I am not impressed. The staff was friendly and the place is clean. The restuarant was a little over half full but it took them over 35 minutes to bring out our food and everyone ordered breakfast. How long does it really take to cook eggs? I usually go to the park central mall location but the scottsdale location was more convenient today. Needless to say their service was very slow. I don't plan on returning to this location. Maybe too many snow birds go to this location or maybe they were just short staffed. But the food was still good at least!!

I can't believe I have never tried this place until now. It's the best Italian Restaurant I have found since I've left upstate NY. It's a small little mom and pop place that's family owned. The chicken parmigiana, baked ziti, lasagna, and antipasto were yummy. Very tasty tomato sause.  The restaurant is BYOB and cash only but it's a must DINE!!

The staff was nice and friendly but the weight time for the food was very slow. I ordered something simple, a chicken ceasar salad but the dressing seemed to contain a strong taste of vinegar. I enjoyed the music, played rock n' roll.

I love the food here but its getting harder and harder to find a parking spot. They share a small parking lot with starbucks and a place upstairs called The Side Bar. I highly recommend you never go here after 5pm if you want dinner because you will NEVER find a parking spot. I would suggest going to one of their other locations in the valley.

They have great salads & sandwiches .. you can create your own salad your order one from the menu .. you can also had tri tip, chicken or pork to your salad ... The Ceasar salad is the best I've had in Phoenix.  Also has a quant atmosphere .. good for dining in or take out .. and it's healthy for you =)

Came across this place by accident .. just happened to be at Desert Ridge Market Place and it happened to be opening day.  The food that I tried was boneless buffalo wings and they tasted very good and also had a familar taste like I've had many years before that I've been craving for and missing for the last 5-10 years. On my way out at the hostess stand I complemented the guy up front which just happened to be one of the owners and I told him the wings tasted like the ones from the restaurant Players Bar & Grill that use to be in the Arizona Center (Downtown Phoenix). He said he use to own it but sold the location in 2003.  So if you've been craving those boneless chicken wings from Players you've got to go ...it's a MUST!!  My friend had a salad with steak on it and he said it was yummy.  I will definetly be back to try more stuff!!!  The atmosphere feels like a casual family sports bar.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. They have a big menu and lots of food to try and their prices are reasonable too.

Just tried this place this afternoon. Very friendly staff & great rates with no commitments. You don't need to worry about paying some $25-$40 co pay like at a regular Chiropractic's office each time you visit. It's $49 a month and you get four visits a month. It's not like massage envy where you have to sign a contract for a year and its hard to quit. This goes month to month. Try it out once for $19 if you want. This company is really growing. So stop by and see for yourself!!
