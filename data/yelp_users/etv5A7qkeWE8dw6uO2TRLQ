Damn Lotus of Siam, why is your food so damn expensive for these itty bitty portions!  When you think of Thai food, you think sweet, sour, spicy, and decent portions!  This place is definitely over-hyped and overrated.    The wait is long, but I'm sure most people already know and are prepared for that (The wait time for my large party was 2 hours.).  The dishes I admit are delicious, however I left very unsatisfied and still hungry.   Garlic Prawns - These were quite delicious.  I hate that there are pieces that are empty.  Worth a try but not worth eating more than once, very simple dish that you can probably make yourself with a deep fryer.  Papaya Salad - Nothing special here, don't get me wrong it is good (you can't really mess up with papaya salad).  Again such a small portion, what are they expecting to feed, a baby rabbit??  Pad Thai - Tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.  Soft Shelled Crab Drunken Noodle - The soft shelled crap was crispy, and alright.  This was okay for me, it was quite salty but the blandness of the greens evened it out.  Sweet Coconut Rice, Fried Bananas - I enjoyed this very much however, again overpriced for something that tastes the same almost everywhere else.  Tom Kah Kai Hotpot - The soup was delicious, however the chicken was like rubber!  Honestly after my group finished our dinner, we were hella confused because all of the other good reviews.  We are from Cali and there are Thai restaurants everywhere, for the amount of our bill, we could have had good Thai food for a week!  Don't feed into the hype people, I'm sorry Lotus of Siam, you disappoint and probably are popular because all these people are being suckered by the other hyped reviews (a sad cycle).

2 dollars even, for a custom ice cream sandwich (say whatttt?)!  When you first walk by this little ice cream shop, it actually feels small and unimpressive but don't let that deter you;  the magic happens once you reach the counter. Plus, even the chairs have Nom-Nom's in them (lol).  Pick a first cookie flavor. WHAM! Pick a second cookie flavor. BAM! Pick an ice cream flavor. Thank you MA'AM!  It's hard to go wrong, the ice-cream is thrifty/bb and the cookies are just the right size.  I opted for a red velvet+chocolate chip cookies with strawberry cheese cake ice cream.  It was the perfect amount of ice cream sandwich, sweet but very manageable (not an overdose of sweet tooth fatty guilt involved like most other related places).  You can definitely be creative here.  Go order 5 and you'll have enough cookies and ice cream to build a pazookie.  Order 2-3, and you can have stacks on stacks on stacks. The possibilities!  That's all there is too it.  There is room for improvement but it is quite solid as is (they need to work a little bit more on the layout/decor).  It really is one of those ideas where you sit and go, "why didn't I think of this?"    There are DIY milkshakes also.  Delicious simplicity at it's finest.  ****** For reference: ------------------------------------- Cookie Choices - Chocolate Chip, Mint Chocolate Chip, Double Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter, Snickerdoodle, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut, Circus with M&M's (avail. most days), Red Velvet (avail. Thurs., weekends), Pumpkin Gingersnap (seasonal).  Ice Cream Choices - Vanilla, Chocolate, Mint Chip, Cookie Dough, Butter Pecan, Cookies & Cream, Triple Caramel, Coffee, Rocky Road, Peanut Butter Crunch, Strawberry, Strawberry Cheesecake.

My buddies and I decided to stop in to grab some beers to escape the heat.  What we didn't realize was the place didn't open for another hour.  The bartender however was quite gracious and was happy to serve us poor sweaty saps.    I opted for several of the local brews (Ninkkasi, dark and malty) and they definitely hit the spot.  The variety is great (see the pictures) and there are loads of beers on tap and available.  If you want to take a peek before venturing in, the menu is quite extensive: http://worldofbeer.com/locations/Tempe/menus  Since the place wasn't officially open, the bartender stood by and chatted.  Very cool girl, I don't recall her name but she was from California and she was very knowledgeable about the beers and the things to do in the area (and randomly, San Diego (lol)).  The ambiance was a typical bar getup and there were TVs with sports.  Very chill.  -----------------------------  For the beer-illiterates like myself: When choosing a beer, the bitterness level is measured by IBU.  IBU usually ranges from 0 (watery) to 120 (cough syrup/medicine (IMO)).  Beers are categorized in Malts (dark with usually hints of caramel, coffee, nuts, etc), Stouts (barley), Porters (dark and dry), Ales (full bodied with hints of fruit/spice), and Lagers (aged, very carbinated with a medium hops taste). ----------------------------  Cheers!

What the hell is this sh*t?  First off, this crawfish place goes off of market prices so they are subject to change (the prices are on a separate menu).   I ordered 1 lb of crawfish, 1/2 lb of shrimp, and 1/2 sausages (6 pcs).   You can choose the level of spice which goes from baby spice to extra spicy.  I myself opted for Hot N Juicy Special(mix of Cajun, garlic, lemon pepper, Louisiana) in mild and should have heeded the warning from my buddies about the inconsistent heat levels.  Whoever is in the back mixing the seasoning needs to be re-trained.  My shrimp came out very spicy and my crawfish came out blazing and painfully hot.  By the time I finished, my eyes were watering and I was sniffling up and down.  Even my friend's "baby spice" was pretty hot.  The crawfish tasted like rubber!  I found out it was because it was frozen (wth right?)!  The shrimp and sausage were also very, MEH.  My buddy ordered Clams and Mussels, 1 lb each.  They left hungry!  I would avoid this since the weight of the shells really put a damper on how much food you actually get.  The service here was horrid at best.  They forgot to put the sausages/corn/potatoes in the bag.  They didn't know what we ordered and mixed up the 1/2 pound things with the pound things.  The food inconsistently came out, it was a good amount of time until we all got our food.  They even forgot the things we ordered and we had to do a recap at the end with the waitress when asking for our check.  Once we finally got our checks, is it weird to have "tap water" as one of the things on the check?  Damn, never again.      This is the most rubbish Cajun crawfish and shrimp I've ever eaten and the only saving grace is that, this is the only restaurant of it's type in the area.  Otherwise I would have definitely given it 1 star.  Aw, you poor people of Tempe, Arizona, you guys are totally being gyped of what could be great. *Sigh*
