Thai House does a SOLID lunch! Healthy, lots of options and cheap prices. Get here early because there will be a line around the block from all of the regulars who work in the area.

Awesome awesome BBQ in N Scottsdale at a quaint, unassuming venue (it's inside a gas station). Beef Brisket and Pulled Pork are my 2 favorite dishes. I'm not a huge fan of their shredded chicken. Sweet potato fries and Mac N Cheese are their 2 best sides. Also, huge smorgasbord of BBQ sauces. I come here at least 2x per month.

Hands down one of the best massage experiences I have had. Samantha was very accommodating to my schedule and was able to book me on short notice. She can come to you or accommodate you in her space which is exceptionally CLEAN!!! I tend to go for a deep tissue massage to help me cope with an active style and Samantha definitely did not disappoint! She will now be my number one option for massage up near my neighborhood(Pinnacle Peak/North Scottsdale)!

Food was off the chain. However, the staff and owner make no bones about letting you know that you represent dollars to them. As soon as our last entree was on the table, they were trying to rush us out. After dinner, my friend and I shared another drink and caught up. The owner, bus boy and both servers made us feel like we were infringing on their ability to turn the table. We are talking every minute, on the minute. It felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable. The food was good, but these people lack tact. We were "camping out" no more than 20 minutes. We would have ordered another round along with dessert but I simply couldn't bare it any longer. To top it off, the 2 adjacent tables sat vacant for 10 minutes after their patrons had left. Will not be back.

Check this place out! Great resource for athletic shoes from experts. Great service, no long lines(REI) or pushy sales people (RoadRunner). Plus, it's a small business!

Some of the best authentic Italian food in AZ. Chic modern ambiance. Great place for a date or casual dinner with family/friends.
