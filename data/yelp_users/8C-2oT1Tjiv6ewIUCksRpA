This was our first visit to The Nosh, and we really enjoyed it.   I had a breakfast sandwich that consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, and cheddar cheese on a garlic bagel. They put a lot of bacon on the sandwich. It wasn't as crispy as I prefer, but I still enjoyed it. I also had an iced coffee, which was pretty good.  The people in front of us in line seemed to have several questions, which made our wait a bit long but it also gave us a chance to really study the menu and choose which bagels we wanted so we knew exactly what we would be ordering once it was our turn.   The food took a bit longer than I would have liked, but it was a busy Saturday mid-morning, so it wasn't a big deal.

I love coming to Coffee Rush. The employees are friendly, but more importantly, they are experts when it comes to crafting amazing espresso drinks.

This was by far the best experience I've had with an optometrist's office. Everyone I encountered and spoke with was friendly and courteous. They explained everything very thoroughly. I will definitely continue going to Chandler Eyecare for my future optometry needs.

My fiance and I eat at Chelsea's about once a month. We love the chicken nachitos. Don't be fooled by the name; they are enormous. There is nothing "ito" about them. They come generously topped with fresh shredded chicken, silky melted white cheese, chunky guacamole, and sour cream. That appetizer is accompanied by a fantastic red salsa. Yum.   Another of our favorite entrees is the swordfish tacos. The fish is always tender and cooked to perfection. I love the homemade tortillas and kale salad too.   The service is always impeccable. They are quick to refill bevs and ask how we are doing.

I had a turkey, bacon, and avocado sandwich on sourdough. There was a bit too much chipotle mayo on my sandwich, but I was able to scrape most of it off. The canteloupe on the side was a bit underripe, but overall it was a great lunch and I will be back!

I really miss working close to Pho Chandler. When I worked in Chandler, I would go here for lunch 1-2 times a month for lunch. I usually get an order of spring rolls and the P2 with veggies. It's the best pho I've ever had. I'm pretty sure there are medicinal benefits to eating this soup. If you're looking for excellent Vietnamese food, this is the place.

I stopped in for lunch last week, and I was so pleasantly surprised at the high level of customer service I received. It was my first time trying Casanova Bros, so the owner gave me a brief explanation of the menu and some possible options to try. He introduced himself and shook my hand. The garlic knots were delicious, and my slice of pizza was hot and delicious. This place has superb customer service and great food.

I understand that Sundays at 10am are a busy time for breakfast. This place has some logistical issues that need to be worked out. There is no host stand, and there didn't appear to be an actual host. People just wait around in the "lobby" until a server verifies how many people are in the party, and tells them where to sit.   All the servers seem to wait on every table. This can be confusing. We were seated within about 10-15 minutes of getting there, but the person who sat us didn't give us a menu. We had to flag someone down and ask for a menu. Someone came up after a few minutes to get our drink order. We decided to order our food at that time since we didn't know the next time someone would swing by the table. It took 10 minutes after we ordered to get our coffee and iced tea, and he didn't bring the water we asked for.  When the food came, it was just average. I had a build your own omelette with pancakes. It was not worth the drive or the wait. I won't be back. There are several breakfast options in the area that operate more efficiently and have better food.

Melody is a fantastic stylist. She makes my wild, curly hair look so much better. She listens to what I want, makes great suggestions when appropriate, and will work with you to find a hairstyle that fits your lifestyle. I love going to Melody for a haircut.  She is friendly and fun to talk to, which is not necessary to be a great stylist, but it definitely makes the experience much better.

This restaurant is around the corner from my office, and I'm so glad I found it.  Every time I go here for lunch, the food is consistently good. The atmosphere of the restaurant is beautiful and clean.   The sushi is delicious, and always tastes fresh. Their spicy tuna roll is my favorite.  I usually get the lunch bento box with miso soup and a dish called Seafood Otaku, which contains shrimp, scallops, and mixed vegetables in a spicy sauce.

This place was rough. Their neon sign wasn't on tonight. We should have just assumed they were closed and moved on. The host was great. He sat us right away, and brought water and chips and salsa. We waited 15 minutes for the server to come and take our order. He didn't introduce himself or ask if we had any questions; he was very abrupt. I ordered the taco and enchilada combo, and my fianc√© ordered the carnitas plate. He said his food was average. The shredded beef taco was good. The meat had nice flavor and texture. The enchilada was awful. The red chili sauce was so spicy, and it had lots of seeds and chili skins in it. The texture and flavor were not good. We waited another 15 minutes until our server came back with the check. I wouldn't go back here.

Kelly has been doing my hair for over 2 years. She is an expert, and so much fun to talk to. It's obvious that her goal is to make her clients look and feel their best. She is very detailed, and she uses high-quality products to yield the best result. I love the suite-style salon she works in too.  Kelly gives personalized, individual service to all her clients. If you're looking for a new salon, call Kelly and make an appointment right away.

I am so lucky to live close to Frost. Everything I've ordered there is delicious. My son loves the sea salt caramel, which is their most popular flavor. I get a different flavor every time I go in. This is so far beyond a typical ice cream scoop shop. I like getting an affogato (espresso poured over gelato) or sorbettini (fruit sorbet blended with Pellegrino).

My friend and I went here the other night. We had an affogato, Nami cake, mint/oreo tsoynami, and 2 soy vanilla lattes.   The service is really fantastic, and the espresso is very good.

I have been to this place twice. My favorite food item is the black & bleu burger. It is so delicious. The second time I ate here, I tried the Jinglehopper cocktail. It's bright green and a bit overwhelming when you see it, but it was so delicious. They have great happy hour specials on drinks and appetizers, and the servers are friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be back!

I really enjoy the food and atmosphere at Over Easy. I had a cup of coffee and the spinach benedict with hash browns. My hash browns were done perfectly, but one of my eggs was hard poached. I really look forward to breaking into a perfect runny poached egg yolk with my benedicts, and when I told Laura the problem, she was quick to ask the kitchen to poach me a new egg. The menu has a great variety of high-quality food.

My company had a team-building event here. The service, food, and drinks were great.   We had a great time bowling and playing laser tag. The bowling area is very clean, and we liked the option to have our pictures on the screen for each person's turn.   The laser tag area was larger than I expected. We probably looked ridiculous to the kids playing in there, but we loved it.

We tried Ike's for the first time yesterday. The menu is kind of overwhelming for first-time visitors, but once we looked it over, we were able to find something we liked. I had the Bear Hug on Dutch Crunch bread.   I liked the "Happy Hour" special where you get free chips and a drink from 4-7.  It's kind of hidden in a shopping center near Fiesta Mall, where some of the businesses have closed. We'll definitely go back if we're in the area.

Today was my first time trying Naturally Sweet. I ordered the Bahama Mama smoothie, which has strawberries, pineapple, coconut, white chocolate chips, and other good things. It's served in a cup that's approximately 20 fl. oz, which is a great value for $5 in my opinion. The consistency was to my liking, and the taste was well-balanced. I would definitely order from this truck again.

I was very impressed with this place. I saw the sign on the building a few weeks before it opened, and I was curious because I had never heard of MOD Pizza before.  MOD stands for Made On Demand. I would compare it to Chipotle, but for pizza. The price is determined by the size of the pizza. You can get any amount of toppings, and it's the same price.  I had a MOD size (regular). I think they said it was 10 or 11 inches in diameter. The crust is thin, but not too crunchy or burned. I thought the crust was perfect. I had the Ulysses, which has garlic, mushrooms, mozzarella, parmesan, asiago, and gorgonzola cheeses. I added pesto and artichoke hearts. It was delicious. They also had a refreshing marion blackberry lemonade which I really enjoyed.

I have been back to MOD about 6 times since they opened. Every time I go, the line moves quickly and the food is consistently good. They have an online ordering feature on their site, so it's nice to have the option to order online and run in to pick up the pizzas as well. MOD has become my go-to spot for pizza.

I still love this place. I eat here about twice a month. The food is consistently good, and there are so many options. I can try something new or stick with an older favorite. I'm glad to see that they are busy and doing well.

I reserved judgment until my second visit. It's just not good.   Today I ordered the kung pao noodle bowl with tofu. When they called my number, they had made it with chicken. I told them about the mistake and they re-made the dish. When I got it back it was mostly cold and just did not have good flavor. The way they slice their vegetables doesn't really make sense. The slices of red and green bell peppers were huge. It didn't taste fresh, and there was no depth of flavor, just a lot of sweet sauce. Nowhere close to real kung pao. The Lipton tea they have tastes very processed, and not "fresh brewed" as it is labeled.

I'm so glad there is a Zinburger in Gilbert now. We went to the pre-opening dinner, and had a fabulous time. I had the watermelon mojito, which was a very refreshing drink. We shared the green chill fries as an appetizer. They were decent. I tasted more chipotle aioli than green chilies. My burger was called "My Boy Blue" and it was perfectly cooked and delicious. The mister had the "Samburger" which is his favorite at Zinburger. We can't wait to go back and try the brunch menu!

This place was spectacular. The atmosphere, the service, and the food were all excellent. My first visit was yesterday, and I am already planning my next trip over there (I live in SE Gilbert).   I had coffee and the Green Eggs and Hamwich with a side of hash browns. My son had scrambled eggs, sausage links, and a chocolate chip pancake. Everything was delicious. I will definitely be back.

Not for me. I fully admit that I'm not a ramen expert. I didn't like the flavor of the broth, and the pork was very chewy. The best part was the soft-boiled egg.

Awesome Thai iced tea! As far as food, I've tried the eggplant and tofu, pineapple chicken fried rice, and chicken potstickers. Everything is consistently delicious and the servers are helpful and friendly.

We were so impressed by the quality of food and the warmth of the owner's hospitality. We tried the Cuban sandwich, crispy chicken sandwich, and banana pudding. Everything was delicious. I especially liked the flavor of the pickles on the sandwiches and the texture of the bread. This place is an absolute gem.
