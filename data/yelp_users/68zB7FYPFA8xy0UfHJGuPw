Heading to this restaurant in downtown Phoenix from far north Scottsdale was definitely worth the trip! This is one of the best, authentic Mexican restaurants we've eaten at in the Valley. The place is small but they do take reservations and it's noisy. The atmosphere brings you back to a vacation in Mexico. The menu  is mostly fish with lots of choices to choose from.  Everything smells great and is very favorable with reasonable pricing. My husband and I shared the Molcajete Caliente which was so tasty and not spicy, I don't do spicy. They give you their homemade tortilla chips with a red and green salsa the green is the mild but to me that was spicy! My mom had the shrimp with caramelized onions and peppers basically a shrimp fajita, which she thoroughly enjoyed, Everything is fresh and handmade even the corn and flour tortillas. We were given a complimentary dessert by checking in on Yelp and we shared the Chocolate layer cake which was rich and decadent. The only disappointment was the Margaritas, we have had better. Great service and on Fridays they have Mariachis. We will certainly return again.

Went Saturday night for drinks and dessert since Franco's Cafe is closed on vacation. We had Tiramisu, it was small to share but very good. The espresso is very well made, short pour with the creme' on top, so made just like in Italy, perfection! We both had a cocktail. I can't remember what my husband had and I had the chocolate.tini We both had the same reaction about the drinks good but we weren't wow'ed and they both were little smaller than we expected for the price. The singer was great and a nice addition to the evening. My husband appreciated that they allowed him to sit outside at  the farthest table from the entrance so he could have a cigar, so I'm sure we will be back.

This is our families second time visiting the St George Antiochian Orthodox Church for their Festival of the Middle East. What a wonderful warm community! We felt so welcome last year that this year we decided to attend their 9am service. The church is beautiful and the service was old world traditional. Similar to the pre1962 Roman Catholic Church but yet different. A worth while experience. The festival was a lot of fun and A LOT of delicious food. We tried almost everything and it was fabulous! The desserts couldn't be passed up and making a decision was very difficult. Wonderful food and wonderful hospitality made for another wonderful experience this year. I am sure we will return soon.

Went during AZ Restaurant Week and we were pleasantly surprised. It is a neat old building with lots of nostalgia and was fun to walk around reading the various photos on the wall and learn history that I never knew before and we've lived here a very long time.  The food is good starting with delicious corn bread and biscuits that came with honey butter, yummy. They also give you a relish tray with carrots, zucchini, celery and black olives. We stuck with the restaurant week menu which was well worth $44.00/person. My husband had the chili and really liked it and i had the steak soup delicious packed with lots of meat. We both had the 16oz. prime rib medium rare which was tender and cooked to perfection with a very good au jus (not salty). We both took 1/2 home and ate it for lunch the next day (still great the next day). Since a mild horseradish sauce comes with the meal my husband requested the real horseradish and our server promptly brought it to him. We also had the whiskey sweet potato mash; it makes you feel like its the holidays, sweet with a hint of cinnamon and cloves,excellent. We both had the pecan pie for dessert, lots of nuts and delicious, especially with bourbon whipped cream. Service is good, our waitress was very bubbly. We probably will return but if it isn't restaurant week it is pricey and it just doesn't have the upscale feel that other steak houses in the valley have at that price level.

Met friends at Roy's on Saturday for Happy Hour and although the food was okay the service was below par. Our first complaint was the overly loud music which the waitress commented that he is known to be loud and plays there only on Saturday's, we then asked if we could eat outside and were told no because it there had been a little rain on Friday and the marble could be wet, hello this is Phoenix! It was 92 degrees on Saturday! The busboy must not have been properly trained because he almost spilled soy sauce on my husband's white shirt and then poured reg water into his sparkling water which we had paid for and then when we told him he didn't make any adjustments, no offering to replace his sparking water or even apologize. I complained to the waitress about our busboy and she went directly to the manager and no response from him either! I doubt we will be back.

Hadn't been to Houston's for several years and it was as good as we remembered. My husband and I shared the Kale salad which was delicious with warm rotisserie chicken and just the right amount of dressing to favor it but not too much that it was overwhelming. Our only disappointment was that it wasn't as large as the other chicken salad so not quite large enough to share especially when that is all you are having.  My mother had her all-time  favorite, the prime rib dip and she loved it, tender non-fatty prime rib on what seemed to be a pretzel roll and said it was better than the one she always orders at White Chocolate. The service was great very accommodating and eager to please.  We will definitely return.

Went to Morton's because we had a $50.00 gift card and didn't think we would ever use it and with the excuse of Restaurant Week despite the mixed reviews decided to try it out. It was just okay, the bread, onion loaf was just a loaf of bread probably heated in a microwave because after the first slice it got a little stale. We ordered the 6oz filets they were tender and cooked just right but none of the side were very exciting. The Lyonnaise potatoes were tasty but very greasy, The broccoli might have been frozen broccoli and the Hollandaise was tasteless. The chopped spinach salad were good but cannot compare to the warmed spinach salad at Mastro's. Their only Riesling by the glass was not good quality for the price. For dessert we ordered the chocolate souffle which was delicious but both of us couldn't detect any chocolatiness in it. I actually asked "is this the chocolate souffle?" Our waitress was great, we can't complain at all about the service but we have definitely been to better steakhouses. We don't plan to return.

In our house we call Dr. Stolper is the "Dog Whisperer". He has such a way with dogs that they absolutely love him. Dr. Stolper has been our vet since we moved to AZ in 1986.  My daughter who is now married and has had several of her own dogs still has Dr. Stolper as her vet. It is hard to find a doctor of any kind that is more clinically competent, compassionate. generous as Dr. Stolper. The office is clean and the staff is wonderful. There are not enough words to describe how much Dr. Stolper and his staff mean to our family.

Had friends over and decided to try Totties Asian Fusion for the first time and all 5 of us were delighted. We were pleased beginning from the ordering process; the girl was very helpful on the phone. And we actually received everything we ordered, no mistakes. We started with egg rolls, they weren't greasy! Awesome! They were very light and filled with vegetables. The WonTon soup not only had broth and  WonRon noodles like some you get but was filled with lots of vegetables, chicken and shrimp. I had the Moo Shu Pork which was delicious, it came with a good amount of pork and 4 tortillas and I got an extra 3 with extra sauce which made it perfect. My husband had Pad Thai beef at a level 5 heat which he thoroughly enjoyed but may go to a higher level of heat next time. Our friends got Shrimp in Lobster sauce and Thai Se Ew with a level 3 heat and both thoroughly enjoyed theirs. The portions were all huge so we had plenty for left-overs and price was very reasonable the total bill was about $75. We will definitely return.

My last review of Totties was on their take-out but this time we ate in the restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in since it is in an older strip mall.It is much larger inside than we thought and the decor is very nicely done with some very nice Asian painting and sculptures. It has low lighting, calming colors and is just a very relaxing environment. They had some great choices of drinks and dim sum on the Happy Hour menu. I had a Lychee Mimosa, a great suggestion by our server, it had just the right amount of sweetness and bubbly. We had the tempura shrimp and egg rolls, both were crispy but not greasy and very tasty with a variety of dipping sauces. We shared a Mongolian Beef which you could choose white rice or fried rice. We chose the fried rice and both were delicious, again not greasy or too salty. Our server was very attentive and we really enjoyed our meal. Great prices and good food.Glad this restaurant is so close to where we live.

Tried this local restaurant soon after moving into the neighborhood and was pleasantly surprised. Great service and very good food we all has the seafood pasta with Antoinette Sauce. Very tasty. Nice green salad comes with dinner. Not overly expensive. The atmosphere is relaxing and dark inside very similar to how I remember Italian restaurants back in New Jersey when I was a kid. Great tiramisu. We'll definitely return.

Absolutely awful! My mother-in-law invited us here despite my urging her not to go here due to the amount of bad reviews. I thought I'd play it safe with the grilled chicken and vegetables but the chicken was dried out, chewy and bland, luckily the vegetables weren't bad. My husband ordered ground beef tacos and he found them to be inedible due to a funky taste. So he switched to a quesadilla which he managed to eat some of but said the cheese tasted odd on left a greasy film on the roof of his mouth. The service isn't great either.  My husband asked for a spicier salsa 4 times before they even brought it out and it was tasteless and watered down as was the regular salsa, even the chips were tasteless, bland. The guacamole tasted like the powdered instant kind.  My husband loves good tequila and checked out what they had and reported back that they only had bottom self alcohol. They do have a fun outdoor dining patio. It certainly isn't worth eating here considering the quality of food and cost. There are far too many better  Mexican restaurants in the area .

We went with a group of 14 for New Year's Eve and everyone had a great time. Everyone enjoyed their food, not one person had a complaint. Everyone said their meals were perfect. The service was great especially what is probably their busiest night. I has the walleye and it was delicious and perfectly cooked as was my husband's filet mignon. The sweet potatoe soup was delicious and I think we all could have had more it was so tasty. Good prices and decent size portions with great atmosphere. We will certainly return.

We expected much better. The design of this restaurant is great, the service is great but the steaks are not great. They started us with a complimentary thin slice of cucumber topped with tiny lentils, a tasty tidbit. We then had the lobster bisque which was very good with large chunks of lobster in it. My husband had the bone- in NY strip,medium rare, it was grizzly and very chewy, not worth a price tag of $50. I had the petite Piedmontese filet mignon, 6oz., although extremely small for $50.00 it was very good. We were then given a small scoop of complimentary blood orange sorbet and finished the meal with the pecan pie, good but not memorable. With all the steakhouses in Vegas we have no reason to return here.

Can't understand the hype. Breakfast here is far from relaxing. The best part of our breakfast was the toast. The rest was just a step above Denny's. Poor quality ingredients my husbands blueberry waffle was crisp but nothing special. The blueberries were just on top not mixed into the batter. It came a blueberry sauce so he had to request maple syrup and it certainly wasn't the real stuff. My mushroom and Brie omelet was very basic with small of Brie and canned mushrooms. Instead of trying their coffee we opted for Americano's and they were weak but at least not bitter. Glad they sat us inside with a view of the street since the street odor was not very pleasant.

We choose Capital Grill to celebrate our 24th Wedding Anniversary because you can smoke cigars at dinner on their outdoor patio. Our table was decorated with rose petals, a memento photo was taken, we were given complimentary champagne and dessert. Our waitress, Sarah, was excellent, and had great suggestions. I had the Mojito which was good but Sarah turned me onto the Stoli Doli a combination of Stoli vodka and fresh pineapple juice which was refreshing and very tasty. The Lobster Bisque was delicious, loaded with large pieces of lobster. We split the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico steak and the Lobster Mac and cheese which was probably the best mac and cheese we ever had! Only complaint,. the blue point oysters  didn't have a lot of flavor.

Absolutely Fabulous! Everything was great, no complaints here. Great service and great food. The choices on the special Mother's Day menu were plentiful and the portions large. Everything was prepared perfectly and delicious starting with the bread basket which we devoured 2. It was definitely worth the price. We will certainly return!

Another great dinner with great service at Capital Grill. We had a combination of different menu items from the bar menu to items to share. All delicious. The Lollipop Lamb Chops on the bar menu are a great choice especially if you are looking for a lighter dinner. You get four lamb chops that are perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious!

It has been approximately 2 years since we had gone to Fleming's at DC Ranch. It had always been a great steakhouse but we were disappointed with out last visit on Easter Sunday for their brunch. To give them credit we rarely go out to eat on holidays because it is usually chaotic and it certainly was that. The restaurant wasn't as clean as we remembered and the service wasn't as attentive as we previously remembered The food quality reminded us of an upscale Outback. We did receive the $25.00 dining card which was nice and we will give it a go one more time when it isn't so busy.

We returned last night to give Fleming's another try and we were very pleased. The service was great, very relaxed atmosphere, much quieter and cleaner than on Easter. Our server, Erica, who was excellent gave us a great suggestion on having our steaks with the pan seared crust which was delicious. My husband had the bone-in New York strip which was huge and I tried the dry-aged ribeye which was probably one of the best steaks I ever had. Both were cooked to perfection. We had the grilled asparagus for our side, a great compliment to our meal. My mother has one of their small plates, the filet mignon, which was the perfect size for smaller appetites and she loved it. Erica also suggested the chocolate lave cake for dessert which was decadent and perfect finish to a great dinner.

We've been to the Spotted Donkey a few times, never very memorable. Cute typical Mexican restaurant decor, nice outside patio. Fun to go with friends for drinks. Pricier than your average Mexican restaurant but of course it is in a high-end shopping center at the Boulders in Carefree. Most Mexican restaurants you fill up on chips and salsa prior to your meal but you won't have that problem here unless you want to purchase your chips and salsa. The Sangria and Margaritas are are good and they do have a great selection of Tequilas.The food is typical Mexican fare, good but nothing spectacular.

Went for lunch and the service is always good and food very consistent and plentiful. Salads are huge and tasty. My favorite is the WCG Best and the ahi tuna. But they also have good burgers and a great French dip. There are so many choices on the menu, so there is certainly something for everyone. It is helpful to make reservations since it is always busy and you can make them on Open Table. It is very similar in style and menu as a Houston's.

Awesome! What a great lunch! The service, the food everything was great! We shared the crab claws which were delicious and our waiter suggested we try the hash browns and they were great. Definite must-have! Excellent key lime pie with a great graham cracker crust. Even the read basket was wonderful. You've got to eat at Joes!

Can't beat the ambiance! This is a quaint, adorable shop/restaurant, so very British. A wonderful place for ladies to enjoy time together. Many women wear hats. There are so many pretty knick-knacks to look at, from china tea services to jewelry and stationary. It is definitely a very feminine place. The teas that they serve are absolutely amazing, you don't need sugar or crème they are so good. My favorite tea is the chocolate cherry tea. When we go we normally split a tower which is more than enough and priced well at $14.00 each. The scones are delicious served with Devonshire crème and imported jam. The finger sandwiches are good a variety of salmon, chicken and cucumber salad. The top tier is tiny desserts all are very interesting and different. It does make for a lovely afternoon!

I really had higher expectations for this restaurant. I love Italian food but I guess I've become a Italian food snob. This could be from my growing up in N.J with a deep history of Italian chefs from Sicily and a 100 year old family owned  bakery. This place is mediocre at best. The best thing was the pizza dough knots and the red sauce isn't bad and they make a good Sangria. My mother and I were disappointed with the pizza. Her's was too runny needed cooked a little longer and my pizza was bland despite paying extra for poor quality prosciutto. My husband ordered caprese salad and felt that the mozzarella was not the best mozzarella he'd ever had. He also ordered the shrimp scampi which he thought was okay but felt he has had better.  We had plenty of left over pizza and felt it wasn't worth taking home. We didn't bother with dessert. We couldn't imagine it being worth the added calories. But I must say the service was good, very friendly and attentive. Obviously, we won't return.

Shortly after writing my review I received a message from Katie the General Manager to be kind enough to accept a $25 gift to return and give us another chance to earn your business. I thankfully replied that I would decline the offer. I then received another message from Katie who had the audacity to request I change my review.   Here is what she wrote: "Thank you for taking the time to reply. I understand your answer but I do wish there was something I could do to change your mind. Yelp reviews significantly effect our business and I would be extremely gracious if you would consider updating your review." Enough said...

My husband and I went for brunch on Sunday and the place was very busy. Great menu lots of items to choose from. I had the kale, brie, bacon omelet which was very tasty but small for most restaurant omelets, the only side it came with was 1 slice of dry whole wheat toast but luckily had some type of current jelly which was wonderful to top it with. My husband had the burger which was hearty on ciabatta bread, it came with their sweet potato chips which are delicious. The waiter told us they have really great organic coffee but my husband, who I call a coffee connoisseur, only certain beans, french press and black for him, thought it was acidic and bitter as did I.  The waiter was very nice and did deduct it from our bill. All -in-all I'm sure we will return again.

Decided to have dinner at Vogue Bistro when visiting family in the area. Although it is a smaller restaurant the interior is lovely. They have a full bar, an open kitchen and the decor has a contemporary French feel. Also, the staff was very attentive. The food is very good. 3 of us had the meatloaf which was very moist with a very tasty cherry brandy type sauce. Another hit was the au gratin potatoes, very tasty, nice cheesiness with the potatoes sliced paper thin. Another member of our group has the lasagna and although it looked very different and came in a bowl he said it was very good. The only drawbacks we found was the bread seemed tough and chewy, possibly warmed up in the microwave. And 3 of us ordered the mac n cheese side and all 3 of us were a little disappointed, the pasta was a rigatoni noodle which was slightly under-cooked and far from cheesy enough but nether-the-less tasty. I'm sure we will try it again the next time we are in the area.

Stopped here for lunch on our way to I-17 and we were pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the staff, cleanliness of the restaurant, large amount of menu choices. We arrived at 12:20pm and could have had breakfast or lunch (lunch starts at 12:30). We opted for lunch but noticed other patrons orders of pancakes coming out and they were huge and looked really good. My husband and I had the mushroom burger and it was bigger than we expected and it came with a large portion of fries both white and sweet potato. My mother had the turkey BLT which was also huge, lots of crispy bacon and your typical deli turkey. All-in-all it was a very filling lunch.

I'd give this place 0 stars but I had to mark something. We actually never did eat here but after walking in noticed the place didn't look very clean. Then we were given menus that were sticky.  We ordered sparkling water and I noticed that the glass they gave my husband was very smeared with fingerprints. So we told the waitress who inspected the glass as if we were lying, she then walked off with it. She returned with what we thought was a new glass. My husband went to take a drink from the glass and noted a bad smell so he asked the waitress again for another glass.  At that point a waiter also came to the table to check what was happening. The waitress told the waiter "I wiped the glass out with the blue rag". As if it should not be a problem At that point we said we were leaving and offered to pay for the water. Although they didn't accept money for the water the waiter did say "Sorry we weren't up to your expectations". We will never return.

Stopped by The District at the downtown Sheridan Hotel for lunch and although the menu selections are small the food is very good. My husband had the tacos and he talked about how tasty they were for many hours after we left. He especially like the beans that came with them. I had the 3rd St. Market Salad with Salmon and it was excellent very tasty, large piece of salmon, perfectly grilled, it was so good I wished the salad was larger. Service was excellent our waitress was very friendly and made us feel at home. I took 1 star away due to the parking. You need to park in the underground garage which was very tight and difficult to find a space. If you go bring your parting ticket, The District will validate your parking.

Great for Happy Hour! We have been here several times to meet friends for the Happy Hour. The bar is the best place to be with live music and a great Happy Hour menu. The ahi tuna tacos are good as are the sliders and chicken satay and if you like oysters they are very good. This time I went with an appetizer instead of the Happy Hour menu and got the mussels, excellent and a good size portion. Smoking is allowed in the front patio off the bar so if you want to smoke cigars or cigarettes but I'm not sure if you can eat outside since there are no tables just bench seating but our waitress did tell us they they are going to be redesigning the outdoor patio sometime soon.

You could probably find anything you want here. McClendon Farms has probably the largest display of organic fruits and vegetables and everything is very fresh and appetizing so much so you could easily over-buy. Fabio the baker has delicious Italian pastries and breads. There are several other bakers there that are also very good, along with jams and salmon and places to eat of you desire. Bootleggers restaurant is selling their wonderful smoked brisket. It has a vibrant buzz and as the morning goes on it just gets busier. So my advise is go early, they open at 8am and bringing a shopping cart or at least bags.

Our family had 9am reservation for Father's Day and it was a perfect time since there were very few people in the restaurant. It was quiet and the service was great. We all decided to get the breakfast buffet which was $26.00/person. It came with 2 cooked to order items. Omelets with a nice selection of fillings and a huge, fabulous waffle that was light flaky with just the right amount of crunch. Several baked items to choose from like cinnamon buns that were delicious, sticky, crumbly topping with a little bit of bacon on top.  There was actually more food than we could eat; bacon,  sausage, french toast, potatoes, scrambled eggs and sausage besides from fruit, yogurt.  Our waiter was very prompt with refills on water and coffee and removing dirty plates. It is a lovely restaurant in a  perfect setting, right at the foot of Camelback mountain.

Great, friendly wine bar. Very comfortable come as you are and get great service. There is a large selections of great wine and the food is delicious. Nice selection of flatbreads loaded with toppings and good sized sandwiches. There's no scrimping on the cheese board with a nice selection of cheeses. What is nice is if you are a cigar smoker you can go to Maduro Cigar Shop next door and smoke your cigar and be served food and wine there. The owner of Cellar 13, Mike, is always there making sure you are comfortable. It's almost as if you feel you at visiting him at his home.!

My husband and I went to Frog Leg Friday and even though I'm no connoisseur of frog legs these were absolutely delicious. Very tender and tasty and not at all greasy. You get a dozen for $12  and they are fried in a light batter. We shared the 12 which was a perfect amount but we devoured them in no time. We also had the brisket stew which was tasty but don't be in hurry to taste it. It was so burning hot I burnt the roof of my mouth and I am still suffering the consequences of it 5 days later. The stew comes with brisket grease cornbread, it may not sound good but it was moist and delicious could have easily gone for seconds on that.  This was the first time we have gone to Bryan's and not gotten BBQ but as always it was worth the trip.

I've been there a few times and its not bad if you are seeking a hamburger in a cute setting and you want to sit outside ad you have a dog with you. The burgers are nothing to brag about decent size and sweet potato fries were a bit overcooked and just your typical frozen fries. Service is pleasant but very slow for the food to come out.

What a wonderful place to go to on a Saturday morning. You feel as if you have left Maricopa County and wound up in Northern AZ! You can purchase great muffins, cinnamon buns, apple dumplings from Tammy Coe Cakes and coffee or get fresh vegetables and wonderful breads and all of types of preserves. One that is especially good is the cinnamon apple spread. They are making pizza which looked delicious and have live music as people sit around fire pits. So glad I live so close to this amazing place.

Had a Groupon so we ventured a little further than usual. Very crowded, vibrant bar scene with lots of TV's all around. Typical bar menu. Burger with sweet potato tots were good, the pretzel was a little too greasy. Good selection of beers. Before we left I went to the one person at a time restrooms, for a bar it may not be the best idea but when I walked in i quickly walked out. It was filthy! Afraid what the kitchen may look like!

We choose Scarpetta for our 25th Anniversary dinner which we booked in early January with hopes of sitting by a window overlooking the Bellagio fountains but wound up to our disappointment sitting further back with a view of the building instead. But that was our only complaint. The food although not inexpensive was excellent. The fusion of flavors left you wanting more. We shared the burrata with beets, then the Short Rib with bone marrow Agnolotti. Both excellent and topped the night with a very creamy and light soufflé. They really know how to make espresso just like you get in Italy. Great service and delicious food made for a wonderful night.

Went with friends while at Wild Horse Pass Casino. The food was tasty and inexpensive I had the Honey Walnut Chicken and miso soup and you get good size helping. I only ate a little over half. Everyone in our party enjoyed what they ordered. So if you want Chinese food that's good and not expensive this is a good place to stop.

This was our second stay and we love it. Very classy, quieter than some of the other hotel. None of the craziness that you find in some of the larger hotels. Beautiful rooms with balconies. Great amenities, nice soft large fluffy towels, fabulous bed and pillows. We were offered an upgrade to a suite which started at an increase in price at $75.00 but we were able to get for $50.00 which gave us a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower at Paris, Paris. To top it off the location can't be better, you are in the middle of it all, walking distance to every place you'd want to go and the Cosmopolitan has a great choice of good restaurants.

Visited family in Casa Grande and stopped here for lunch. Absolutely a great experience. The food was fresh and delicious. Service great! I had the Florentine omelette with roasted red peppers and choose the biscuit. It was loaded with fresh vegetables spinach, mushrooms, red onions and red peppers all grilled and them put into the omelette the biscuit was light and flaky. It comes with roasted Potatoes  which has the perfect crunchiness. My husband loved his green giant hamburger which was huge. My in-laws lived their choices too.  They have a huge menu, love story of options with great prices. 4 great breakfasts for $35.00. Can't be beat especially coming from the valley. Before leaving we purchased some bakery items. We bought a large brownie and 4 chocolate chip cookies. The brownie was soft and gooey with walnuts and chocolate chips, drizzled with fudge and the chocolate chip cookies were just fabulous so with just the right amount of crunch and lots of chocolate chips.

Met friends for dinner and as usual there was a wait. Trying to call in ahead to get on the list doesn't work you need to be present to get on the list. Our wait time was about 1/2 hour and they don't take reservations. The food preparation and service was great! Very tasty and healthy but the portions are small especially for the men who were still hungry after spending close to $100.00 per couple with drinks. I had the miso black cod, very tasty, our friends had the special which was the scallops, they were about  6 the size of a quarter  in the plate but they tasted great. My husband had the kale salad and spaghetti squash also very good  The men were impressed though that the price of a double shot of a decent bourbon was only $10.00. We would go again but would definitely need to order more food.

I only tan in the summer and this is my second season here. It is awesome! The owner is great, easy to work with. No hassles with signing up or freezing. The place is spotless! The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. I plan to be back again next year.

Great shakes! Went for mid-afternoon snack. Had sweet potato fries and a pumpkin pie shake. Both were great! The shake was extra thick with a huge glob of thick whipped cream on top. Absolute bliss! The burgers looked huge and delicious to.

This was our second time to Jaleo. It is pricey for small plates but they are good.  Great choice of Tapas, the Iberrico ham is excellent and worth trying since it isn't available in every tapas restaurant. Everything is perfectly prepared with great presentation. The staff is great, very helpful with assisting you make decisions.

Very disappointed this trip. Went to the Henry our first stay 4 years ago at the Cosmopolitan and breakfast was always great. This go around it was quite different. The coffee was bitter, the omelets were unremarkable, consisting of meager amounts of ingredients. My husband omelet had all the ingredients thrown on one end. Service was good, no complaints there. Once was enough, we didn't return for breakfast our two remaining days.

Went with our daughter for Father's Day brunch. Must say we really enjoyed eating here, it has a cozy feel with comfortable seating, good service and great food. My daughter and I had the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes with honey butter , comes with fresh blueberries and crispy bacon. Perfect size, moist and delicious. My husband had the eggs and bacon and his fried eggs were cooked perfectly. My mother had the red velvet pancakes topped with marscapone, she loved it but I tried it and to me it tasted too much like dessert. Not that it wasn't delicious; just too sweet for me.  All-on-all we were very pleased and will return again.

Went to Arcadia Farms for brunch on Mother's Day and had a very nice time. Service was good as was the food. Portions are a good size, just right for a normal to hearty appetite. I had the chicken crepe which was very good. The omelet bar was satisfying for the others all though my daughters needed to be remade since she had requested no cheese but got cheese. But it was not a problem. Our server  brought us complimentary biscuits but gave us the last 2 they had although they weren't bad they were a little dry. Luckily they also brought us butter and a great tasting jelly which certainly helped. Later they mad up for the biscuits by bringing 2 cupcakes which were fabulous, with a one of the best frosting I've ever had; moist  not too sweet, creamy and it didn't taste like Crisco. Tried the Bellini but could have done without that tasted more like a weak Mimosa.All-in-all we will probably return since it is close to home.

We wanted to eat at Ocean Trail but it was c any busy so instead sat in the outdoor patio of the cigar lounge with friends making our only choice for food the Black Fig. First the service in the cigar lounge was poor waited 1/2 hour to have anyone come to our table to order drinks and had to ask for them to clean our very dirty table. This was a quiet night in comparison to other times we've been there.  We ordered food in the lounge but had to pick it up and was told it would 20-25 minutes. That's okay since we thought was being made fresh. We found out that wasn't necessarily true.  My Meditarrain salad was a little soggy the chicken was cold and very dry and the salad very acidic. My friend got the Chinese chicken salad and although her chicken was warm she felt the dressing was overly sweet. Both came with a slice of very stale bread. My husband said his burger was okay, nothing special and the sweet potato fries must have been sitting under a heat lamp; dry and hard. We haven't been to Talking Stick for about a year and this was definitely disappointing. Hope this was an off night because this used toga great plac to go.

As an Italian from New Jersey with multiple restaurant chefs in the family I don't know what others are eating here that has given this place such rave reviews. We started with the Fig-Sambuca Bruschetta which the presentation was great and it was very tasty but spreading out the cheese over the figs really improved the flavor since the way it is served you get a bite of cheese and then the second bite is fig no cheese. The combination of fig with cheese is much better. We then had the Margarita pizza which was bland, bland crust just pretty much tasteless, nothing memorable. Doubt we will be back.

Went to their new location on Hayden Rd and FLW on Saturday and we were very disappointed. First the menu is a condensed version of the Phx location.  Second we were surprised they only carry 2 of their own beers. They  do have lots of other micro-brews like several Four Peaks beers but if I wanted Four Peaks beer I could just walk over there since they are in the same parking lot especially since the food and service is nothing to brag about. We only had dessert but it was store made brownies, and I could swear the dollop of whipped cream was Cool Whip. Yuck! There really is no reason to return.

In July my husband and I went to the North Scottsdale location and w were very disappointed but decided to return but to the Indian School location. What an improvement on the beer choices and the menu. Great beer and terrific food. My husband and I shared pork  tacos which were very good but the seafood mac and cheese was fabulous! Very cheesy with lots of very large shrimp, My mom came with us and she had the pastrami sandwich and she loved it, she couldn't believe how lean the meat was. We finished off with the caramel apple pie which is to die for. It is a must have! We had great service, the place is very clean and of course dog friendly and our dog loves the complimentary dog treats. We will be back.

Went to Soul Cafe today for the first time with co-workers and we all loved it! I had the grilled vegetable salad w/chicken in a light balsamic dressing. It was huge and delicious. The waitress recommended I get the chicken warm rather than cooled since it is a warm salad which was perfect with large pieces of asparagus, zucchini, peppers, onion and eggplant with a mix of greens. The others had the caprese salad sandwich, hamburger and margarita pizza all were large portions and looked great and they loved it. Comfortable booths and nice atmosphere and friendly efficient staff. I will definitely be back!

Went for lunch on a Saturday and it was very quiet. I know a lot of people complained about the service but our server was very nice and attentive. We only had the Margarita pizza whichever we shared and it was good. Great crust! But from what I can remember it wasn't as good as the pizza at the original location downtown. Will be back the next time I'm in the area.

Very disappointing. Heard great reviews from friends so we went despite  reading some of the Yelp reviewers that weren't pleased. My husband and I split the 1/2 rack of ribs. Very small portion and nothing to rave about. Bryan's BBQ is much better.  We also split the truffle Mac and cheese which came out in an iron skillet whick you would expect to be steaming hot and it was just warm and very bland. The baked beans came out of a can!  The women's room was being cleaned during the height  of the dinner hour and they wouldn't let you in even to wash your hands and no extra napkins were given or wet naps. Definitely not worth the trip.

We had Dickey's BBQ catering for our Memorial Day House Party and they did a terrific job at a great price with an abundance of food. Starting from John, the Assistant Manager who made ordering everything very easy, he had great ideas on how much food I would need and he was professional and very accommodating. Their staff arrived a few minutes before I expected which was great and they were pleasant and courteous. The food especially the sides were delicious. The ribs were a little salty for my taste but everyone thought the food was wonderful. My favorites were the mashed potatoes, just yummy creaminess with a touch smokey bacon flavor and the doughy yeasty rolls, I think I ate most of them. We still have some leftovers today. If you like Dickey's food I would highly recommend their catering service.

I bought 2 spray tans on Groupon and I am very glad I did! I never tried spray tanning before so was a little nervous about to do, what to expect and especially what I would look like after. The owner put me at ease, answered all my questions. Her instructions were easy to follow  I didn't look scary when I left and the tanning process was easy, The owner made me fell very comfortable while having the spray tan done. After leaving I followed the directions as instructed and had no problems. The day after results are a perfect even, healthy glow. I look forward to having my second tan done. Also, they have some really cute clothes there too that I will definitely check out the next time I'm in.

Celebrated my husband's and Mother's birthday there and it was wonderful! There were 9 of u plus a therapy dog and the staff accommodated us very well. I was able to make reservations since we were a large group and requested a low-top table and we were seated right on time at a table that was low-top, no problems. Our food was amazing, great large burgers. I had the PBnJ which may sound odd but was perfect just the right amount of PBnJ with a touch of Sriracha sauce. Others tried the pablano, one had the just bacon both very pleased.  1 had the tuna sandwich and 1 pulled pork, both piled high and no complaints.1 salad that was huge! Even the dog had a plain burger and loved it, very moist. The french fries are good but the sweet potato tots are a must-have crispy outside moist inside. We shared dessert the brownie, marshmallow fluff with Reese's chips with a scoop of ice cream. It was warm, moist, decadent and gooey. If you have room its a must. Our waitress, Beedle, was amazing, very attentive and I salute her for a doing a great job separating everyone's bill since all the couples were not sitting together. A great night all-around!

Z's is a small restaurant that you could easily miss but DON"T, it is a treasure when you venture in. For us it was a great neighborhood find. The decor is simple, the service is warm and inviting and the food is absolutely delicious. Best Asian food we have had in a long time. We had the crab puff appetizers which we could have eaten a dozens of, they were that good. Everything is made fresh to order. I had the Pad Thai with beef which was different than I have ever had and oh so tasty and my husband had one of the Thai Curry dishes which he had made to the spiciest and he thought it was amazing. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are large. We will definitely be back.

if you want excellent authentic Italian cuisine this is the only place to go.  Great service, delicious food made with quality ingredients. Franco,  the owner is always there making sure everything is perfect. And it always is. We have gone several times and no Rmatter what we order it it top notch. Our last trip was Christmas Eve and I shared the the seafood medley or as the Italians know it as the seven fishes with my mother. It was a combo of a 1/2 lobster, crab, shrimp, sea bass, clams, mussels and calamari and we both had more than enough. My husband had one of the veal dishes and he said it was delicious and had a fabulous sauce. We shared the tiramisu and the maringatta both are great and can't be missed. You won't be disappointed.

Another excellent meal! We took friends this Christmas Eve who had never been to Franco's before and not only did they rave about the food that night but my husband and I continued to get texts the next day on how fabulous the food was. When you go to Franco's it is like going to visit your Italian family in Italy. The atmosphere is vibrant, warm and welcoming. The food is superb! Fall-off the bone tender osso bucco, black ink pasta to die for. Everything is freshly made and of the best ingredients. The bread, the desserts are the absolute best. No matter what you order you will very happy!

Stopped by for lunch and it was difficult to decide what to have; everything sounded great. I opted for the Quinoa/Chicken Salad which was very good, the dressing was creamy and mild and from what I understood the dressing is made from shaved onion, the creaminess seemed like a combination of the onion and the quinoa. It was almost like having a pasta dish but healthier without the white flour. The portion was the perfect size.  My husband had the starter port belly which he loved, lots of large pieces of pork belly and vegetables. For a starter it was large enough for 2 people. Great Service, Great Food, Interesting Menu! We will definitely return.

So glad this place is right in the neighborhood that I have recently  moved into. Since my first review we have been here several times and the food is always amazing. We have taken several friends and family members and everyone has enjoyed the food. Always fresh, always delicious, always innovative recipes with a menu that changes monthly. Great service, all the staff is very friendly. They have a full bar with a great selection of micro-brew beers. Definitely is our local go-to place.

Great service, great food with wonderful ambiance. We have eaten breakfast and dinner there several times. If you let them know you are local you can get a frequent flyer card. On your 5th visit you get a free entry. Can't go wrong. For breakfast,  try the chocolate bacon waffles. They are to die for! Dinner we have had the meatloaf which is great. The burgers are terrific and  a definite yes! on the chicken and waffles. If you order the duck fat French fries make sure you are sharing with a huge group. Delicious but so filling because you have to save room for their desserts made with home made ice cream.

This place is wonderful and relaxing due more for the setting than the food. We purposely went on Father's Day because my husband loves their chocolate bacon waffles and to our dismay they are no longer on the menu. When he asked the waitress she offered to see if they could still make them for him and they did! We sat outside on the patio which is nestled in between the Pinnacle Peak mountain range. Absolutely beautiful and so peaceful. The food and coffee is good but it is pricey. The bill for 4 people with tip was almost $100.00. If you live in the area ask for the frequent flyer card which gives you a 5th entree at no charge.

We always enjoyed going to Proof but our last 2 visits, one was breakfast and this time for dinner we were disappointed. The view is all that it really has going for it. The service is friendly but still not up to Four Seasons standards. The menu has changed and now has fewer options. My fried chicken and waffles were tasty as was my husband's meatloaf. Both were very filling. The cauliflower side was delicious. But our biggest "Yuck" moment was when my husband got 1/2 down on his beer to realize stuck to the inside of his glass was a long blonde hair. When the manager approached he told him, showed him the hair and they did bring him a new beer but made as if it was no big deal. Doubt we will go back.

Only had take-out but the food is quite good. Some traditional Mexican menu options with a twist. Large portions, great taco's, you can choose between flour or corn tortilla. I had flour and I tried a variety and the best was the short rib, the carne asada and the chicken were good though too. Will definitely be back.

I had heard great things about this place and thought it was worth driving a little further for. It was extremely busy but it did not detract the staff from being able to offer great service. They made sure we had a comfortable  table to sit at since we were with my 87 year old mother, some tables are high tops. Our waiter had great suggestions and a great sense of humor. The food is fantastic with great happy hour pricing and a buy one get one for the 4th. The crispy Brussels Sprouts which are amazing. My husband had the tacos and they were huge for an appetizer. My mother and I had the lamb burger which was delicious and for an excellent ending we shared the Bananas Foster Beignets. Definitely worth the trip and we will  be back!

We had the $5.00 Happy Hour Specials and they are all amazing. We tried all of the tacos on the menu, all delicious, I was a little afraid I wouldn't care much for the fried egg on top but it just added to the flavors and I'm a fan. The crispy fried chicken in rosemary and honey is a meal in itself and delicious.It comes with a biscuit and that would be my only complaint the biscuit was dry, not flaky. The white sangria was addictive it was so good! We finished off the meal with the apple pie which was an actual small pie, so definitely made for sharing and can  be shared with 3 or 4 people, it comes with a huge scoop of their homemade vanilla ice cream which easily stands on its own due to it's rich and creamy texture.

Tried EVO because we received a local coupon and so glad we did. They have a great Happy Hour with lots food and alcoholic beverages to choose from. I chose the Indigenous Sangiovese, very flavor and a good pour for $5. Happy Hour is from 4p-7p. We shared several items on the Happy Hour menu like the: Black Pepper Risotto; very creamy but with just the right amount of spice, the Arancini, delicious creamy cheesy rice balls, crispy outside not greasy, the Daily Bruschetta which was a combo of ricotta, honey and walnuts; tasty. We tried one of the entrees, the Gnocchi, which was good but could have used more gnocchi than cauliflower. The gnocchi was very light as was the cream sauce it was in. We finished with the Brown Butter Babycake, good size fresh whipped creme on top and delicious. My husband biggest complaint was it was too hot in there. The waiter told us the air wasn't because the doors were open to the outdoor patio and the open kitchen probably made it hot.  But despite that we already have plans to return with friends next week.

Great new pizza restaurant! We were so glad to find a good local pizza and pasta restaurant nearby. We have always liked Andreoli Italian Grocer for casual dining but when. You live near Carefree central Scottsdale is a drive.  The pizza was great, very fresh ingredients and tasty. Average price for gourmet pizza. Pasta dishes looked good too.  There was a constant flow of people coming in and all tables were full. Many were repeat customers. We will definitely. Return and bring friends.

I had given Teatro a rave review after my first visit but had noticed when I returned with friends this month that it just wasn't the same.  The portions seemed smaller, the quality of the food was not as good and the cannoli's which had been excellent (and I still have family in NJ that own an Italian pastry shop, so I know a good cannoli) had changed the filling is now slightly runny.  The reason probably is Fabio, the chef, is gone. I saw him the next day down at the Downtown Scottsdale Farmers Market selling pastries and bread. He said he'd been gone a few months. Very disappointed to no longer have this neighborhood gem. No wonder they weren't as busy.

We visited downtown Phoenix for the Home Show and needed a place to eat. Opted for Pomo because Matt's Big Breakfast was too busy (probably why we've never been there). We had been to Pomo's Scottsdale location when they first opened and never returned because we just weren't wowed. We still weren't wowed.  I guess I'm very particular about my pizza because of my strong Italian roots. The crust was good, nice amount of char but overall just tasteless pizza. We had the Margarita Pizza and the Pizza Chef. Both good size pizzas but no distinct flavors, the tomato sauce was bland, very light in color; definitely not a hearty sauce even for pizza. If it wasn't for the prosciutto on the Chef  it would have been completely tasteless. I've been to much better pizza places in the Phoenix area.

This was our first visit to Virtue and it was thoroughly enjoyable! The setting is beautiful, very warm and cozy; inviting. Lots of greenery, comfortable seating. Some of the menu items were unusual so we needed to ask several questions but our waiter was very patient with us and answered all of our questions with ease. My mother ordered what was called pizza rustico but was actually not a pizza at all but more of a quiche'. My husband and I had the creamy polenta with chistorra, our waiter told us it is a  sausage from Portugal topped with 2 fried eggs, very tasty and seemed to be very popular. I'm just sorry that I asked for my eggs over medium because they wound up being over well. Our daughter had the yogurt with figs which she enjoyed. The coffee and espresso was made just right and our dessert was the zeppole  which were very light and delicious. We will return again.

One of the best burgers I have ever had! The mushroom burger is great very juicy, great mayo pesto sauce and very fresh homemade buns. The truffle fries are hand cut and delicious and you have to try a milk shake. Very thick and although I contemplated which one to get the Nutella Chocolate Pretzel was phenomenal, worth the calories! Service is great too, our servers, Charlie and Paul were very attentive as were the other members of the team.

This was my second visit and the food once again was terrific. This may only be me but the only downside I would say is it might be best to know the menu before you go in. You are greeted by a host at the door, handed a menu and once you walk you are greeted by a another host who hands you a number for the table you will sit at and then you approach the counter to order. It may seem efficient but with people behind you waiting you can feel a little rushed and the menu is quite extensive, front and back. After this last visit we asked for a menu to read it better and realized there are 2 types of fries! I was just ordering fries and the staff that takes your order never asked which ones I wanted. Next time I will have my order ready to go before I walk in the door.

The Alo Cafe reminded us of the small cafes you would see in Northern AZ. Small, warm, friendly with good home cooked food. My husband and mother both had waffles which they said were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I had the build your own omelet and it had lots of veggies and cheese. Instead of the usual bread options I switched to their homemade Kugel (I think that's what they called it) bread.  Toasted with butter, it was absolutely delicious. The service was great too! We asked if they had French pressed coffee and although they have a French press our server said they never make it. Our server went out of his way trying to make us the perfect pot. He did a terrific job! The owner stopped by our table and was very friendly and made us feel very much welcome.  We will return again.

Great family place, reasonable prices, large menu. They have a great selection of whiskeys and bourbons, good selection of craft beers. My husband and I shared the full rack of ribs which fell off the bone and the bbq sauce was sweet but the portion was small and I'd have to say I've had better but they were good. Mac and Cheese came on the side and it was also good with just the right amount of crispy panco on top. My mother had the french dip and she loved it, very lean meat with sauteed onions and mushrooms, great soft bread. Hamburgers are large and the blackened catfish was very good. The thing on the menu had to be the bread pudding; excellent! Our server, Jennifer was great, good sense of humor and made our fining experience fun.

After walking out of New York's Best we went to Los Sombreros. Great choice! Their Cadillac Margaritas are delicious.  My husband had the the beef tacos which was loaded with large chunks of tender beef. I had the chicken mole, best mole I've had. It comes with black beans, rice and mixed vegetables. The tortillas are all hand made with masa. Servings are large,  service is good and it is clean. Will return.

Been there twice now and have enjoyed it each time. The service is friendly and very helpful. They have a great selection of beers and make their own moonshine, the apple is great! The Bootcheutta is delicious great unusual combination of ingredients that blend so very well. The deviled eggs are great But their signature item is the smoked brisket which is amazing, so tender and juicy.

Had ta Groupon that included a beer flight and a charcuterie board. The beers are okay. Not memorable. Saison was the best. It had a little more body than the the others. All were very light. The Salud board was good but again not impressive. The poor girl that was working was trying hard to keep everyone happy but the flow could have been better if there were at least one other person working.

I called at 9AM last Saturday for an appointment at 9AM and they were very nice and said they could take me when I arrived. Got there 9:10 and was impressed by the decor. I t was very fresh and clean and the blue color is very soothing. Tony did my pedi, got a basic, and it was wonderful. He gave lot of attention to detail and a wonderful massage. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because they don't use the tub liners in the pedi spa. That I would say was my only turn-off. Otherwise it was a great experience.

I cannot tell you what the draw is to this place but it certainly isn't worth waiting for a table here. The pizza was the worst pizza we ever had, anywhere! It was bland, tasteless but with an occasional funky flavor mixed in. Very expensive pizza when you consider the poor quality ingredients it is made with. I can't complain about the service but they weren't overly busy when we were there. This was our first time going there and we will never go back.

Went with my husband last night. It is Mediterranean fare and we both had the lamb skewers and it was excellent. The homemade chocolate gelato was delicious and their bread is very good too. Right now they don't have a liquor license so you can bring your own bottle which is great for saving some money and there is no corkage fee which is very nice.  Our waitress was very sweet helpful. It is a small intimate family run restaurant that you can feel comfortable dining at.

Best breakfast we had our entire stay in Vegas! Wish we had tried this gem sooner. Decided we couldn't leave Vegas without trying Giada's and so glad we did. Not only did they have the best coffee just out of their carafe that we had for breakfast during our stay but the food was terrific. My husband had the hash which he loved full of fresh vegetables and I had 2 eggs with side of spinach in olive oil and tomato and potatoes. It makes such a difference with good, fresh ingredients. They give you a choice of condiments which included lemon zest marscapone butter, chocolate almond butter, strawberry jam, pepper and Himalayan sea salt. The bread was fantastic so we stayed longer and even tried their muffins which were equally fantastic! Excellent

This is a place that you to when you are really hungry or seeking to share. The portions are huge including the menu. It is hard to choose what to eat since everything sounds so good.  I had the brioche french toast, the bread is made there and each piece is at least 1 1/2" thick, my mother had a side of pancakes which in most restaurants this would have been a full sized order and it only cost $2.95. Can't beat it! Others in our party had omelets which were packed with various add-ins and comes with a side of pancakes. Even the coffee, which is Lavazza, is very good and your cup rarely has a chance to be empty since our waitress kept our cups full all the time. The service is great for such a busy place we had just the right amount of attention paid to our table. They have a great outdoor, dog friendly patio too. But if you go on a weekend be prepared to wait for a table, it is very busy and it's best to sit outside if you can since inside is very noisy.

Went with friends to try this new restaurant during AZ Restaurant Week expecting good food but maybe not so good service after reading some previous reviews. The service wasn't bad.. I think they are trying to work on it. The wait staff doesn't gave the finesse that some of the finer dining establishments have. They start you off with complimentary fried plantain chips, very good. The cocktail, Caipirinha tasted like a Margarita and was very good.  All the food was fabulous! The appetizers were great cheese bread was very good but the pasties were better; was flaky and delicious. We could have eaten a ton of the skewered shrimp, just so very tasty perfectly marinated. The Green Soup was rich and delicious and we really liked our entrees the Fejoada, our friend thought was great, my husband and I had the Picanha also very good. We were all so very full with the huge portion sizes and 3 courses we had a hard time finishing dessert. But dessert was delicious too! Everyone got the chocolate coconut cake which looked wonderful and very rich. I had the flan and it was probably one of the flans I've ever had, very creamy.  The owner Phil stopped by several times to make sure we were happy and it was nice to see a family run business; 2 sons, daughter and his wife all working hard. They had live music with a wonderful Brazilian singer and they didn't rush us out we were there 3 1/2 hours. If you go and love coffee you've got to get the Brazilian coffee each cup is made fresh! We will definitely return!

Went with a group of 6, in varying age groups and everyone loved the food. The special bruschetta with prosciutto and ricotta was probably everyone's favorite along with the Nutella Indulgence we shared two for dessert. My husband and I shared the  Blanco Pizza and it is garlicky, cheesy and delicious. The others had a Margarita and Mushroom and had no complaints. The personal pizza at happy hour is a good size for one and their regular size pizza is great for 2. Appetizers are very large, good to share as was dessert. They have wonderful large craft beer menu (thus the name). The staff is very helpful and attentive but not over-bearing. Our waiter was  extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the beer selections. It was very busy and noisy so our next visit we may opt to sit outside.

My husband is always seeking nice places to have a cigar and if they have a full bar better yet. This was my first time here but since opening my husband has been here several times and has been bragging about it since his first visit. And...it is a thirty minute drive from where we live. The place is quite large with lots of TV's and comfortable leather club chairs and couches. It has decent ventilation for us non-smokers which helps and a outdoor patio. It has a large humidor with a selection of good cigars at reasonable prices. And of course a full bar. The staff is very friendly and came over to us frequently to see if we needed anything.

Went for a pedicure and Nancy did a great job. She does a great massage and paid a lot of attention to make sure my toes were done well. Said she had been in the business for 8 years and you could tell from her professionalism and attention to detail. The salon is very clean and they are using the disposable liners in the spa tubs. Lots of nice colors to choose from to!  I'll be back.

Had a acrylic fill done today by Henry and YES he is the BOMB! He did a fabulous job! Best my nails have looked in years. From having misshapen thick humps, they are now straight, well shaped, natural looking nails. He took his time and made sure I was happy. The shop is extremely clean and the receptionist is great very welcoming atmosphere, she offers you water right away and the prices are good besides that they give you a punch card that after 10 visits you get $10.00 off your service. Right now they still have 10% off all services so it is definitely worth trying them.  I also recommend Nancy for a pedicure and she has done my mother's fills twice and her nails look great too! They also have a great selection of gel and nail polishes.

My husband and I went during AZ Beer Week and were able to sample different beers and and we loved several of the beers we tried. We've been to other breweries around the state and may find 1 or 2 beers we like but theses guys are doing a lot better than most. We were actually able to try several for 5oz sized beers for $3.50 ea.  I loved the Black Gold Porter and the Scotch'dale Scottish Ale and my husband favorite was the Brutus Imperial Stout. He actually went back the next day to buy the Brutus in the 32oz can. Any of their beers can be put freshly into a can and sealed while you wait. My least favorite was the Desert Gold Cactus Ale. The night we were there they had live music and it is a warm, friendly, industrial-looking environment with great service. They offer complimentary popcorn but they don't serve food or at least I didn't see a menu for food or anyone eating. We will return.

All-in-all this was a much better experience than when we visited here in May. The management along with having a great server made this visit very pleasurable. We had no problem this time with the french press and the coffee was excellent; fresh, smooth with no bitterness.  The food once again was very good. The service is tops, the staff really go out of their way to make sure you are happy and that meant a lot to us. The only downside is the noise level. It is a bit to much; between the morning hubbub and the DJ it makes for a bit too much noise. We started with the Cannoli Donuts; they are just delicious, warm, moist with that wonderful cannoli cream and chocolate chips. I had the Americano Scrambler which was delicious and creamy, my mother had the Hash Frittata which she really enjoyed it but it was a little bland for my taste. Both these entrees came with hash browns that are very good, seasoned perfectly and a biscuit which are light and flaky; I could have eaten more than one! My husband had the plain waffle and he commented on how the outside was crispy and nice and moist inside. Everything came out hot like you want with lots of soft butter. Our next visit will probably be when it cools down and we can sit outside on the patio where it is quieter.

My husband had the urge for menudo and in my search for a local  restaurant that had soup I came upon a newly opened Mexican restaurant. Although menudo is not on the menu we were told they have it everyday. It came in a huge bowel for $7.00 and to my husband it was worth that and more. He said the tripe was very tender and the broth had just the right amount of spiciness. I had the carne asada quesadilla which was a perfect size, very tasty, sour cream on the side (at no additional cost) and the beans were excellent; I rarely have the beans but these were worth eating. For dessert we had the freshly made hot custard stuffed churros with ice cream, very good. They have great Margaritas and the service was excellent. The owner/chef's wife was our server and she took care of us as if we were in her home. While there a Mexican band was rehearsing and we were told that on the weekends they perform starting at 10pm. They are also open for breakfast. We will certainly be back!

Cellar 13 closed in May and a wonderful new Tapas restaurant has turned the place around with a whole new look, great outside dining in the back patio with live music on Fridays and Saturdays. The lobster bisque is to die for; having huge chunks of lobster in it. The lamb chops are amazing having a tasty marinade on them making you want more. The bacon wrapped dates are great with blue cheese. Next time I want to try the Paella which looks wonderful and very large. Best creme brulee I've ever had slightly warm and so very fresh. Great service everyone even the owner wants you to be comfortable and makes sure you are happy. There is a full bar and a great selection of good wines. We will certainly return soon.

OMG! This place knows how to make donuts!!! My husband has been here a few times and insisted that he bring the family. They definitely have great donuts. I had the apple fritter, crispy outside soft inside delicious. My mother had a creme filled and she loved it. I tried a little of her creme and the yellow creme was perfect, not greasy, fake tasting or too sweet. My husband had a large filled donut that had coconut, red velvet crumbs and cinnamon crunch on top he said it was great! So glad we live close by because we will be frequenting this location. So glad also that while we were there the place was busy, people kept walking in; that's always a good sign. It is very clean they great coffee and great service. I hope that this place lasts a long time. So much better than any of the chain donut places in the neighborhood.
