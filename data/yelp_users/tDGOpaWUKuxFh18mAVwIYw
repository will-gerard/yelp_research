There is a reason this restaurant has been voted the "Best Greek Restaurant in Phoenix" for 23 years. It is wonderful! Phoenix has a pretty vibrant (and highly competitive) restaurant scene with many excellent options. It's unfortunate that many of our long-standing establishments are overlooked by those trying to patronize the latest trendy restaurant.   We made reservations, but sadly they really weren't needed.  The entire time we were there, there were only 2 other tables of customers. Greekfest doesn't have the best street visibility, so perhaps that is why. Or, maybe it was just an off night or perhaps we were there too early in the evening. The d√©cor has a definite Greek island influence, white and blue and very crisp feeling and we were warmly welcomed and seated.  Our server came over and welcomed us, asked if we had any questions, and took our drink order. The Greeks have had 3,000 yrs. to perfect their culinary expertise, and Greekfest prides itself on theirs. The menu is almost overwhelming, and then there are the specials! Our waiter rattled off several specials, all of which sounded scrumptious! Decisions, decisions. I don't think you could go wrong with anything (unless you don't like eggplant like me).  We started with the Trypoites (Greek cheeses & herbs in phyllo). Off to a great start as they were yummy. Entrees included the lamb shank special which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious - perfectly prepared. Ditto for the lamb souvlaki! Our waiter suggested a Greek red wine (Amethystos) to accompany our meal. Never had a Greek wine before and was pleasantly surprised. The portions were so generous, there was no room for dessert. Next time for sure!  Our experience at Greekfest was wonderful from the moment we walked through the door. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable; they sincerely act as if they are welcoming you into their home. Very nice, authentic ambience.  Most importantly...the food was awesome! That's what we want when we dine out, right?   Do not, do not - drive by this place when you want authentic Greek food. This is a great spot for two, four or fourteen. Support this local restaurant instead of a national chain - taste the difference!

Been here numerous times over the years and it is consistently good. Nice selection to choose from, and always well presented. My lunch companion ordered the salmon which she said was delicious, and would still be talking about it into next week! I opted for the roasted beet salad with grilled chicken. I know....booorrring. But the greens were fresh, the chicken grilled to perfection, and best of all, the salad wasn't swimming in dressing.  We split a piece of the peach cobbler cheesecake. Our taste buds were absolutely jumping for joy. It was to die for!  Lots of locals frequent this place - and often. It's located in a strip mall in an area that is undergoing a revitalization. Don't let that stop you from trying this place. You won't be disappointed.

I have only had mani/pedi's at the Red Door, but they are the best I've ever had anywhere. I don't have artificial nails, and I've always had problems with the polish on my nails chipping - like the very next day!!!  I don't know what Gina does, but the polish on my fingernails lasts a full week, and then they don't chip, they merely wear at the tips. And the toe polish lasts weeks & weeks!   The warm 'bucky' on the shoulders is an added bonus as are the complimentary neck/shoulder massages (when the masseuse has time)

Haven't been to this place in a couple of years so was totally surprised when we walked in the door. They have completed remodeled since our last visit - from darkish and pub-like, to open, bright and modern.   Three of our group ordered the firecracker shrimp tacos and said they were delicious - not spicy as the name implies. The South by Southwest chicken was good, a tad bit dry, but flavorful.   The margaritas were delicious!! Not sicky-sweet so they went down easy...maybe a little to easy!  They have specials - one was the Maryland-style crab cakes. One of our group is from Maryland and warned us that when you see "style" in the description of a Maryland crab cake to stay away! They are Maryland crab cake wannabes! We took his advice.  The staff was friendly and attentive. Hopefully it won't be years before we return. We had a great experience and I'm ready for another one of those margaritas!!

If you are looking for a special dining experience, look no further. Chef Vincent Guerithault is from Provence, France, and combines his expertise in classic French cooking with southwestern ingredients making for unique...and exceptionally delicious offerings. From the moment you walk in the door, you know right away you are somewhere special - and you are treated like someone special. The staff is very attentive, yet almost invisible. The menu changes according to season and availability of fresh ingredients - but one thing you can take to the bank - whatever you select, it will be delicious. Be sure and save room for dessert - they are to die for!! Bon appetite!

We're probably the only people in town who haven't been to either Postino's. I don't know why it took us so long, but it won't be long before we go back, that's for sure. If you like wine, or even if you're not sure you like wine, you have to try this place. Huge variety and knowledgeable staff. Plus the food is delicious and the atmosphere relaxing and inviting.  The afternoon we stopped in for lunch we ordered the half Panini and soup combo. Both the vegetarian and the Tuscan tuna sandwiches were really, really good. The bruschetta's that others nearby ordered all looked incredible - gotta come back for that!  If you enjoy Spanish wine, the Lechuza is very nice.

Wally's bills itself as a neighborhood grill - it's in our neighborhood so we like to frequent it. The food is good and the portion sizes are enough to take some home and have the next day. I tried the french dip with prime rib for the first time and it was mighty good! I'm not a fan of liver and onions, but have been told that Wally's knows how to make it taste yummy. Great atmosphere, nice outside eating area, great menu selection. All around a good place.  We did have a strange occurance after our last visit. We went with friends and split the tab 50-50. While we were in the parking lot saying our goodbyes to our friends, the waiter came out & asked if everything was ok - if our experience was good. We all said yes, and he said he just wondered because when he gets a 10% tip, he'd like to know why. I know we gave him a nice tip - I have no idea what our friends tipped, but I thought it was incredibly rude that he would come out to question us! We've never had this experience at any eating establishment anywhere - I was really taken back. This is not indicitive of Wally's - but Wally, if you read this, please know this didn't set well with a "Wally's Club" member.

A Groupon brought us back to what used to be one of our go-to Mexican food places. Either our tastes have changed, or this place has really gone downhill.   The history of this place harkens back many years & is included on the menu - fun to read. The place has a kitschy atmosphere, and a nice outside area to dine. Located in shadow of the Pointe Hilton Hotel at Squaw Peak, the restaurant still draws many visitors. The night we were there, there were many large tables of guests that appeared to be from out of the area. I know, I'm jumping to conclusions, but locals know how to pronounce "chimichanga", "quesadilla", "machaca" and "chipotle"!  The carnitas tacos were boring and generic and the chicken burritio flavorless. Meh.. Margaritas nothing special. They claim to be "always" voted Best Margarita by a local magazine, but I find that hard to believe. The upside: the salsa is very flavorful. Not a fan of the flour tortilla chips, though.  Years ago we used to come here for the awesome happy hour on their outside patio, which they still advertise. Reduced appetizers during the week, free buffet on Fridays.   I doubt we'll be back. The Valley has lots and lots of places to get authentic Mexican fare. We'll leave Aunt Chilada's basic Gringo fare to the tourists and dine elsewhere.

How does this place stay in business? Like others, I had a Groupon for a mani/pedi and had to book quite a ways out. I can deal with that - figured that the Groupon must have been a huge success which is why they were so booked up.  This was my first (and last) vist to this salon. Not impressed from the moment I walked in - the ambience/setting, call it what you will, was just not appealing.  My nail tech was about 5-10 minutes late - and she never introduced herself to me! The manicure I received was so poor - no cutile trimming, simply nail trim, file and polish. She didn't paint the tips of the nails, nor did she use a file to clean under my nails to get the nail "dust" from the emery board, and consequently - my nails have rough tips.  The pedi wasn't much better although she did do some minimal cuticle trimming. Again, didn't clean under the nail after filing; very little time spent on using the pumice on heels, and a sloppy paint job to boot. She keep having to clean the polish off my toes. Again, the tops of the nails are rough when they should be smooth.  I was in & out of the place in under 1 hour!! I felt that the tech rushed through purposely - perhaps because she knew I was a Groupon customer. But hey, Groupons are great for introducing patrons to a business they might not have gone to before. Doesn't this buisness WANT more clients? Evidently they prefer one-offs (lots of Groupon users checking in the day I was there!)   They certainly lost a potential return customer in me. The staff was inattentive - from the receptionists, to the tech I had, to other employees who walked by. The mani/pedi was sub-par - the Groupon said it was an $87 value - Really??? you've got to be kidding me!   Do yourself a favor - go somewhere else.

Seriously. 19 months after my review, the owner posts a comment. 19 months!!! And, her comments are only excuses! Lousy business obviously run by someone with no business acumen. This only underscores my original review.

One of our favorite places! The food is consistently excellent and the waitstaff friendly and attentive. Not unusual at all for Michelina to visit with the diners and ask how their food is.   It is in its 25th year and is located in a very non-descript center which boasts a palm reader and small appliance parts distributor, but don't let that fool you. Once you walk through the door, you are transported into a very well-designed space with great ambience. Several of the waiters have been there since the beginning, and if you are somewhat regular, they may even remember your favorite beverage!!  I would suggest leaving young children at home - I'm not aware of a specific kid's menu but I'm guessing most people dining here probably prefer their dining experience to be sans little ones. It's a great date place, but also a wonderful place for larger gatherings.  On New Year's Eve, they have a prix fixe menu which is awesome and very popular. You can be notified of special events such as wine tastings throughout the year, too.  Excellent all the way around.

Been here several times over the years and it is consistently good. I don't think it's the best Italian food I've had, but it is definitely good.  When you walk through the doors, you will always receive a warm greeting. And, you'll be transported into a nice restaurant, and forget the restaurant is located in a nondescript strip mall.   The staff is always professional and attentive, making sure drinks are refreshed and that the meal meets expectations, yet allowing you to enjoy the experience.  This visit we started out with an order of crab cakes. They were good, but would've been better without the sauce. And they were large - could be a meal in themselves.  Entrees come with a salad; I do wish they'd do something to make this more interesting that a few green leaves and pale tomatoes. It really doesn't leave the diner waiting in anticipation for the course to come - it is very boring.  The veal dishes we've enjoyed here have all been very good and would highly recommend. The veal is tender and well prepared. The halibut special was good - fish cooked perfectly and very flavorful. Served on a bed of pasta, so the presentation wasn't particularly attractive. The Salmon Piemontese was also very good.   And an Italian meal must end with a dish of spumoni - yum!

This is a favorite of ours - have been coming here for years. That said, we tend to order the same things. If you are looking for standard Sonoran Mexican food, you need to go somewhere else - this place specializes in Mexico City style food. )Although in recent years, they have added some standard Sonoran dishes to the menu)   Love the chicken enchiladas suiza with green chili sauce. And this place knows how to do tacos and chilaquiles.  The margaritas are always good and the tomatillo sauce that comes with the chips is our favorite - we always have to get more!  The restaurant itself could use a little face lift - how about washing the door handles for a start - ick! But the food is always good as is the service.

Even though we don't frequent this restaurant very often, we really like it and have never been disappointed about our food or the service. We recently took visiting family and they are now huge fans!  They both ordered the pork chops - well done. Aarrgghh!!! Pork chops well done??? They'll be so dry and leathery But surprise, surprise. Although cooked to their specification, the chops were very moist and super flavorful. One ordered the maple glazed carrots as an accompaniment to the 2 large chops - and he nearly licked his plate clean. One of the standards are the ribs - they are consistently fall-of-the-bone delicious. It's a large order so plan on taking some home. The cole slaw was not as good as I remember, but that's a minor point (apologies to slaw aficionados!) The salmon was perfectly prepared and delicious. For dessert, we had the key lime pie which was not overly sweet, and had a nice balanced lime flavor; and some kind of hot brownie concoction with ice cream...yummmm. When one in our party dripped a little dessert on their shirt, the server was right there with soda water - how many places do that?  The atmosphere is low lit, up-scale modern steak house type of feel but not cowboy-ish. You can see the cooks working their magic in the kitchen. The only downside comment I would make is we all thought the music was a bit too loud. I understand what the reasoning is behind that, but there were four of us, at a fairly small table, and we had to speak loudly just to carry on a conversation. All in all, service is super attentive but not overbearing - the servers monitor the guests they are taking care of. And, the food is consistently fabulous.

Very nice Italian restaurant.  It's a cozy little place - maybe less than 30 tables. We dined on a Tuesday night, and although there were only a handful of patrons in the place, it filled up fast and by the time we left, there were only a couple of tables left! On a Tuesday!! Go figure.  The meal began with a nice, warm, fresh bread roll. OMG - so heavenly! Not sure what the herb was in the bread, but whatever it was, it gave just the right hint of flavor. The Veal Madeira was very tender , cooked perfectly, and the sauce flavorful. And the pesto dipping sauce was excellent. One of the evening specials was the other choice - lamb chops with risotto.  Six chops! They were cooked to perfection and delicious.  I'm not a big risotto fan so hesitate to weigh in on it. It was cheesy and I'm not sure it would pass the Gordon Ramsey test, but tasted fine.  Our server was attentive; she checked in on us a couple of times to make sure everything was OK. The atmosphere is nice - faux painting deck the walls that give an old-world kind of charm. The lights were a bit bright - they could tone them down a bit to create a nicer atmosphere (maybe they do on weekends??).  As we were waiting for the check, the bus boy came by to ask us if we wanted boxes. Too funny as there were only 2 noodles left from the veal dish!!   Very good food and friendly staff; prompt service. Definitely will patronize this restaurant again.

We dined at Arrivederci over the weekend and I wondered if it was the same restaurant I reviewed in December.  We had reservations and the waiter that greeted us gave us the option of a couple tables - we selected one, and he said no, that was for four people (they why was that an option???) I didn't care to sit at the table for two next to a party of 8 + a baby, so he sat us at another table for four (so if this table for four is OK, why not the other one??)  I was sooo looking forward to that nice, warm fresh herby bread roll...it came, but not so fresh or warm. meh. Not being overly famished, I ordered the cheese ravioli with arrabbiata (spicy) sauce. Flavorful, yes, but not spicy as described. The homemade ravioli were large and flavorful, though. The veal carciofi with lemon caper sauce was good, but not great - the sauce was not lemony at all; the veal was cooked to tender, but again, meh.(we had gone to Nick's a couple of weeks ago and had this dish & it was awesome)   The place was busy - which I'm always happy to see in this economy. We have seen our waiter when we've been there on previous visits - he's not new to a busy night. He wasn't over friendly but did answer our questions, took our order, brought our drinks then went missing. Until of course, it was time to bring the bill.  If this had been our first visit, it would be our last. Still, it may be a while before we return - there are many more locally-owned Italian restaurants that will be all to happy for the business.

It never ceases to amaze me that in the competitive restaurant market that exists in the Phoenix metro area, sub-standard restaurants not only exist, but exist for years and years! Such is the case for Los Compadres. We actually ate there eons ago, and recall it being fairly good. But a lot of years and a lot of Mexican food meals have gone by. Fast forward to the present. We found ourselves traveling down Northern (don't ask why) and noticed it was still there. In a weak (dare I say - nostalgia?) moment, we thought: hey, it's dinnertime - let's go to Los Compadres!  The neighborhood and strip mall have changed...a lot...over the years. Closed & fenced in former restaurant on the corner, lots of empty storefronts. But, there it is - Los Compadres. And the parking lot was pretty full. Good sign, right? (Maybe the cars were there for the dive bar next door.)  We were seated right away, and a nice young man was soon there asking if we'd like anything to drink. Yes, two margaritas please. Chips and salsa followed thereafter - salsa had a good flavor - obviously homemade. The "hot sauce" was not so hot, and not very tasty. We're not afraid of spicy food, so we asked the waiter if he had any Cholula sauce (so we could add some zing to the "hot" sauce.) He said he had Tabasco or habanera sauce.  Wow - zero to habanera! Nothing in between! Well, bring on the hot stuff!  It came in a bowl (waiter said they don't get much call for it.) We added some to the salsas and they ended up tasting better.  The menu is typical of Sonoran-style Mexican fare.  We ordered: 2 hard shell tacos - 1 machaca beef, 1 carne asada; 1 chicken burro. We like green chili, but only saw 'green chili & corn' as a topping option. When asked about it, the waiter simply said it was green sauce with corn. Thank you - I think I had figured that out already. So, the burro was ordered 'naked', with the idea of using the salsa on top. When the food came, the poor burro looked so lonely. Sure there was some shredded lettuce on the plate, but not even the standard chopped tomatoes, shredded cheese & olive!  One taco arrived; the waiter told us the kitchen mixed up the order & made a flauta instead; they were making the other taco & it should be ready shortly. When it came, it was a soft taco on a flour tortilla. Not worth it to send it back. The burro was stuffed with cheese & very bland chicken.   There were quite a few patrons in the restaurant when we arrived so the place is obviously popular. But I am not sure why. The food was underwhelming, the atmosphere is underwhelming, and the location is dodgy. The staff was friendly, though, I'll give them that.  Definitely will not return - no matter how reminiscent my mood gets!

A lot of people like/love Dillion's. I'm not one of them. A truly good BBQ is an art form and Dillion's BBQ is not even close, certainly not "the best in the valley." What you get in portion size (huge) does not make up for the lack of great BBQ flavor and tender meat.  The only reason we went back after our first lackluster meal a couple of years ago, was because of a group event.  It's kind of a dingy place, disjointed in the layout, and not even cute folksy d√©cor - like it was decorated by a committee. Service was lacking - waitress didn't know the menu. I asked if the peaches on the peach salad were fresh and she said yes. She then came back and told me they were canned peaches - really? And this in peach season?? Get a clue, Dillon's! Then on top of it, she got an order wrong - and we kept having to ask for water.  I agree with other Yelper's - there are much better BBQ places around.

I really hate to dis this place. I've eaten here once before and the food was good, but this review is solely based on my recent experience and the horrible service we had.   We arrived for lunch on a Friday at 11:45. The weather was gorgeous so we opted to sit outside. There was one table of about 8,and several others with 2-4 and a number of empty tables. We recieved our drink orders and as we were discussing what we were going to order, our waiter, who was rushing all around, quickly wrote down what he overheard us discussing instead of asking us what we wanted - we had to interrupt him to make sure he was writing down exactly what we wanted. He seemed to be very rushed.  As we waited, and drank our water & tea, we didn't see much food coming out to any of the patrons. The hostess came by & told us she'd get us some more water & tea. We never got it, although we saw her fill up water glasses at a nearby table. Another table nearby got their food. We kept looking at our watches wondering what was taking so long to make a salad and a sandwich. Still no drink refills; still no food.   After 35 minutes since our order was placed (and close to 45 minutes since we were seated) and no food or sign of the waiter, we decided to leave. We went in to pay for our tea and tell them we had to leave - we were on a lunch break and needed to get back to work - and we still needed to grab a bite to eat! The waiter came over and said - "Sorry, everybody's waiting." Do you think he could've at least stopped by our table and said the kitchen was behind or offered some explanation why it was taking so long??? Obviously that never occured to him.  This is a cute place and a lot of the people who frequent it at lunch during the week work in the downtown area. Not everybody can take a 2-hour leisurely lunch!! When I got back to the office and shared my experience with some co-workers, so many said they had similar experiences - that they would never go back, no matter how good the food, because the service is terrible. I can't believe this place hasn't figured out how to serve lunch in a timely fashion - other eateries in the area certainly do.  The food may be good, but if you don't get it, it hardly matters. I won't be back.

I am happy to update my very poor review of Cibo from several months ago and get on the fan bandwagon with all of my fellow Yelpers. I also want to thank the proprietors who took my previous review seriously and encouraged me to give them another opportunity. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to get back to Cibo (life tends to get in the way!!) and believe me, it won't be long before my next visit.  We returned for lunch today and were seated right away. The place wasn't near as busy as the last visit because many had Columbus Day off work. Our server welcomed us promptly and took our drink orders. We decided on hot sandwiches: Sicilian sausage and pulled pork. OMG - they were soooo delicious!!! The pork was lean, tender and in a wonderful spicy (but not overly) sauce. The Fontina cheese was a great touch and tasteful. The bread...ummmmm good. I'm tired of getting sandwiches on so much bread that you can't open your mouth wide enough to bite - the grilled saltimbocca bread was so good! The sausage sandwich was super flavorful with the perfect amount of peppers and onions. Again, the bread complimented the sandwich.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it took a while to get our bill. While we weren't in a hurry, the server walked by our table a couple of times and didn't check in on us. As I mentioned the place wasn't overly busy at all so I would have expected a tad more attentiveness. But overall, the food was outstanding and the quaintness of the little house made for nice ambience.   I'm not a fan of eating crow, but if I have to, I will. I bet the chef at Cibo could even make crow taste phenomenal!

Yelp reviewers were spot on once again in their comments about this place. We've driven by many times and have often mentioned that we needed to try it 'some time'. And on our way to the Spanish Market at the Heard Museum, we decided we'd stop in. It was still early so we opted for the breakfast fare - the fritatta was excellent. Wonderful blend of feta, artichokes and tomatoes. The side of fresh spring greens were a perfect compliment and not drowning in dressing. If you love bacon - you won't be disappointed - you get about 5-6 strips! Topped off with an Irish coffee on a misty gray day - what more could you want. The atmosphere is nice - trendy & casual. The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is that although our server was nice and personable, it took a long time to 1) get our drinks, 2) get our bill when we were done & 3) get the bill back for signing. The food was great and certainly worth another visit.

It's been a while since we dined at SBG and decided we will not wait so long between visits. The food is consistently delicious and the staff is friendly and attentive, but not hovering. We started with a round of drinks (nice variety of options) and an appetizer of the bacon wrapped shrimp - beautifully presently and perfect portion size for a party of four.   All of the entree's were wonderful. The burgers are huge, juicy and cooked to perfections. The Smoked Red Chile Pork Roast garnered 5 stars in and of itself as did the chocolate-espresso rubbed pork tenderloin. Yum! The red chile glazed chicken was also a hit. All of the dishes are wonderfully prepared and pleasantly presented.  SBG used to be owned by the same owners of Phoenix City Grille. Great to find out that the split didn't impact the quality of food or service. If you've been thinking about trying SBG, don't hesitate. You will not be disappointed.

A true Irish Pub - you just might meet Rosie herself. Great ambience - like being in Ireland. Fish & chips are perfect - like being in Ireland. Irish stew is great - like being in Ireland. And the Guinness - not quite like Ireland, but it's as close as you get in the U.S. (nothing tops the Guinness you get in Ireland!!) Limited wine selection which was a disappointment for those of us who are not beer drinkers (I know, I know - Irish pubs aren't supposed to be known by their selection of fine wine!) Something on the menu for everyone; live music on the weekend.

I've been to Padre's about 4 times and it is always consistently delicious and the atmosphere is fun and lively. And you have to love the $0.01 margarita just for checking in! If you are a fan of Carne Adobada, you will absolutely love the way Padre's does theirs. Flavorful, hearty, but not so spicy you can't enjoy the depth of the flavors. The Tequilla Shrimp was awesome and if you really want something different, the West Coast Burrito is very tasty. Our server was great, attentive and checked back with us often enough to make sure everything was OK, but didn't hover. Great place, great location, great food, great margaritas!

Excellent, excellent, excellent. They finally are offering the lamb shanks - and were they delicious! Cooked perfectly, in a very tasty sauce. The kabobs - as usual- were very good, too. A lot of love goes into these family recipies - if you like generic mediterranen food, go somewhere else - this is the real this. This is a favorite place of ours - family owned and operated. Please join us in supporting this hidden gem.

What's not to like?? This place is absolutely awesome and is quickly becoming one of Phoenix's not-so-best kept secrets. I tell everybody about this place. It may be a bit difficult to find for the first time - it's is in a very non-descript area of town, off the beaten path with no street visibility (except when they put their A-frame sign out.) The food is consistently delicious.Both the Asado and White Prawns were cooked to perfection. The sides of chiliglazed carrots, green chile cornbread casserole, chipotle mashed potatoes and creamed corn are also incredibly tasty - and just the right portion size. As much as we love this place, we hadn't been in quite a while so were pleasantly surprised that they have expanded. We sat outside because the weather was terrific, but it is great to know that there are now more tables available for when our weather es caliente!

waitstaff very inattentive.The table next to us asked 3 different employees to take their drink/food order and each one said 'it wasn't their area' but they'd get someone right away. We wanted to order more drinks and the waitress was never around to flag her down & she didn't check back with us until she brought the check.  Food was fine, but not much in the way of Irish pub food.The atmosphere is terrific!. There r other Irish pubs in the area that are MUCH better. Check them out before u trying this place

We frequent this place quite a bit since we live close by. It's a quintessential neighborhood restaurant. The food is consistently good. We love the arriabiata sauce (although sometimes it is spicier than other times - mostly good & spicy.) The pizzas are good, and so are their specials. I've had the halibut special several times and it is always tender & flaky, not overcooked. The steamed veggies aren't soft but have a nice crunch to them  Great happy hour offers, too :-) - if you can find a place in the bar area! They are usually packed.

Located in the mid-town area, Alexi's has been the go-to place for executive professionals, politicians etc. since it opened in 1994. And most of the same staff is still there...including the chef! That alone speaks volumes.  The menu centers around northern Italian, continental and Mediterranean cuisine. We started with the combo appetizer. Yum yum! No rubbery calamari here! And the shrimp and tortellini were awesome. For entrees, we opted for the salmon and the halibut special. Again - to die for. Perfectly prepared, beautifully presented, moist and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The desserts looked incredible, but all we had room for was some spumoni ice cream. I know, I know...but it was a nice change all the same...and refreshing!  Our waiter was great, made sure all was to our liking as well as personable and friendly. We got there a bit early on a Saturday evening, but by the time we left around 7:30pm, the place was packed, and the patio was filling up.  Alexi's is not "trendy" or "industrial chic", and the interior may need some refreshing, but the food is excellent - and a great value. Prices are remarkably reasonable and the portions are healthy.

Not sure what the allure is with this place. Maybe because it's in Scottsdale?? We happened to be in the area on a Friday evening so decided to give Jalapeno Inferno a try. There was already a line forming so we took that as a good sign. A couple of seats opened up at the outside bar so we escaped putting our name on a list. The bartender was friendly, but perfunctory. We studied the menu while we waited for our drinks munched on chips. The salsa was very flavorful, and the chips were part corn- part flour. Maybe I'm just a purist, but really?? Chips made from flour tortillas? Ick! I guess that's how they utilize stale flour tortillas, and the snowbirds probably like 'em. I hate rummaging through the basket to get the corn tortilla chips!  For the entrees we decided on the Tomatillo Chicken Enchiladas and Baja Fish Tacos. Both dishes were mediocre. The tacos were short on fish. The enchiladas had an after-hot, which I liked, but they really weren't anything to write home about. Glad we tried the place. I can't think of why we'd go back when there are so many really good Mexican restaurants in town.

Awesome! Really! What a great surprise. Many years ago, we came here with friends. I remember it being good, but we just never made it back. The Metro Center mall, and the shopping area where this pub is located, has really gone downhill and there are a lot of empty storefronts. But the pub has remained, and after having another meal, I can see why.  The food was so incredibly good! All of the entrees were beautifully presented. The seared cod was perfect - in fact, "the best cod I've ever had!!" was the comment. It came atop mashed potatoes which were described as "absolutely delicious" (and this from a mashed potato aficionado!) The shepherd's pie was traditional (lamb not ground beef!) and so tasty - yum, yum! The corned beef was cooked perfectly and very lean, served with tasty mash.  We didn't get a starter because we knew one of the decadent sounding desserts was in our future. And the Bailey's bread pudding - ahhhh, melt in your mouth awesome.   Our server was friendly, good sense of humor and checked back with us frequently to make sure we were happy.  Awesome pub with food as good as any you'll find in a gourmet restaurant.

Take a trip to GB without leaving AZ!  If you are looking for the ambience of an English pub, you won't find it here. If you are looking for authentic English pub food, you WILL find it at Codfather's! (We've traveled to the UK many times and enjoyed traditional pub food a lot. I don't consider myself an authority, but I do feel comfortable making the claim that Codfather's is authentic). They even have a little area set aside selling authentic British candy, sauces, teas, biscuits, and more!   Of course, fish and chips is the first thing that comes to min when thinking pub food, and Codfather's does not disappoint. Cod, catfish, Mahi Mahi, salmon, haddock, halibut... grilled or fried? Small or large? One doesn't get that many options in the UK!! Plus, you get a side dish - how about mushy peas or baked beans? So British! Or perhaps you fancy meat: they offer pies, pasties, sausage, etc. And of course, you can get bangers and mash, or bubble and squeak,  or a ploughman's platter or even an English breakfast.   The portions sizes are very generous. The small fish and chips is big, the large order is bigger! But the ultimate deciding factor is taste. Again, no disappointment. The fish was fried perfectly, not greasy at all and the batter is delicious. The Cornish pasty was huge (half went home to enjoy the next day.)  The beer selection is awesome, too (some bottled, some on tap.) I've never found John Smith's Extra Smooth anywhere else in town!! In addition to the other UK beers (Boddington's Guinness, Fullers), they offer domestics such as Bud & Coors (why, I have no idea!!) as well as small selection of wine.  Service was great, prices are very reasonable and friendly/welcoming staff. Don't be deterred by the location - make your way to 16th & Bell, and enjoy great pub food at this family owned restaurant.

Yum! First visit to North Kierland and it was so much better than the Phoenix location. It was another beautiful day in Arizona so we were lucky to get a table outside. We did have to ask the waiter to turn off the heater, though! Patio heaters not needed on a mid-70s sunny, gorgeous day. But I digress.  The soup of the day was a white bean and OMG was it ever delicious! Followed by a yummy Salsiccia pizza. Truly, I could've sat there all afternoon sipping wine, nibbling on pizza and watching all the tourists go by.  If you haven't tried North, don't wait, go now.

I love this place! The food is consistently good and the service is always excellent. The Grilled Shrimp & Guacamole Tostado Bites were beautifully presented and tasted a good as they looked. The Ruby Red Trout salad was loaded with trout - no skimping here. If you've never had the Pecan-crusted chicken salad, it is a nice, but not heavy, entree. If you have room, the Ancho Fudge Pie is delicious.  And of course, the best margaritas in town. I'm not a fan of frozen margaritas, but Z'Tejas' are wonderful - with or without the Chambord! They are so good, they limit the number you can have 'cuz the tend to sneak up on you!

What's not to love about supporting a Local Restaurant?   At Maizie's they always have new lunch and dinner specials, in addition to their varied menu, so making a decision was challenging! It happened to be a blustery day when we popped in here for lunch, so it wasn't very crowded. Our waitress was very friendly and gave us ample time to look over the menu.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Sonoran Chicken sandwich and devoured the best sweet potato fries I've every had! My friend opted for a soup & sandwich combo. She loved the Chicken Salad sandwich and said the soup (something with potatoes) hit the spot on such a chilly day.  Although we both cleaned our plates and should've left it at that, we just couldn't NOT (pardon the double negative!) get the Chocolate Bomb. Ooey & gooey with a chewy brownie and 2 huge scoops of ice cream (vanilla & chocolate). This will take a lot of hours at the gym to work off!! But, it was delicious!  I am anxious to go back for dinner and happy hour!

Wow. What happened? We left our dinner last night very disappointed in the fare. positives: our server was great. He checked in on us, made sure our beverages were filled; he good tell we had lots of catching up to do with our friends, so he allowed us the time to do that and not hover over us. The other plus was the trout. Trout is so easy to overcook, and ours was moist and well prepared. The burger was ordered medium rare and it came out very well done. The grilled chicken sandwich was also overcooked and the meat was dry. Where trout can be tricky to prepared, burgers & grilled chicken are menu staples and should be a snap to prepare.   We love supporting local businesses, but this is one I doubt we'll return to after this experience.

This place is in our neighborhood but I don't know why we don't go here more often - it is really very good. Don't profess to be an expert in Indian cuisine, but do enjoy it a lot and this place, although not totally authentic (and that's not always a bad thing) has great food. The place is small & compact, clean, with a modern & contemporary d√©cor.   The "Create your entr√©e" menu is a great idea and a nice option, especially to those unfamiliar with Indian cuisine. The chicken curry was very good. The Chicken Biryani was beautifully present ed and absolutely delicious. The menu is explanatory, and the servers very knowledgeable about all of the dishes. Although no one in our party is Vegan or requires Gluten Free foods, having the option is a smart thing to do for restaurateurs to expand their clientele.   If you are new to Indian food, this is a good first step...go ahead, don't be afraid. You will be pleasantly surprised how good it is, and the fact that Bombay Spice offers healthy alternatives is icing on the cake!

I was greeted right away and given a warm welcome. I was using a Living Social for a mani-pedi, and the young gal greeting me had all that information at her fingertips. She led me back to the waiting area, where there was cheese and crackers, brownie bites, lemon-cucumber iced water and hot water for tea. Very calming area in the Bliss blues and aquas. I didn't have to wait long before my manicurist came back and led me to her station.  Magazines and nail polish selections are cleverly integrated in a Plexiglas divider - almost like a work of art - separating the nail stations from the waiting area and lock, attentive and deliberate in her work. I would recommend and would return.

Finally, a restaurant that offers the option of whole grain pizza crust!! Yeah!! This place re-invented itself several years ago and now emphasizes their organic, gluten-free, etc. offerings. But, you don't have to be a 'health nut' or have health issues to enjoy this place. The atmosphere is nice, the staff friendly, and overall, the food is good and always very fresh. This visit we decided to create our own Neapolitan pizza - a fun way to try different ingredients together - like artichoke hearts and sausage. It was actually pretty good! Our waiter was a bit pushy at first as we took our time deciding on what wine to order, but once that was settled, he only checked in periodically to make sure everything was OK. Nice little place - we'll return.

AWESOME! First time visitor and was not disappointed at all!!  I love it when older buildings are re-purposed. This mid-century modern building used to be a beauty parlor - and is now a pizza parlor! Of course they have other offerings in addition to pizza, but I love how they've kept the 'parlor' theme alive. Anyway, I digress. It was a beautiful evening so we sat outside. I kind of wished we had sat inside because the atmosphere looked great - that and we had a very loud man sitting next to us which was a bit distracting. But I digress.  We started off with the roasted beet salad which was very yummy. I was expecting red beets, but during this visit, they were golden beets. No matter - delish all the same. Practically licked the plate - now that would've been embarrassing! Although the pizza offerings looked good, we created our own. Fresh tomatoes, garlic, sausage, basil, spinach...and it was downright good!  Our server recommended the Paraiso Pinot Noir and she was spot on.    We are anxious to return and try one of the pasta dishes...and more of the Pinot Noir. Great place - and the complimentary valet parking is a bonus.

Awesome place. When the weather is nice, take advantage of the outside patio. But the inside is cool, too. Great paintings and nicely appointed. We began with the Apples, Brie, & Fig Jam bruschetta which was excellent. Both the spinach salad and strawberry-gorgonzola salad were perfect lunch-sized portions, very fresh, and very delicious. Our server was welcoming and attentive. And of course, a great selection of wines.  Great place. Plan on returning again...and again...and again.

Now we're talking! There is a reason this place gets rave reviews and multiple "Best of" awards. This authentic Mexican food, no Tex-Mex here. Incredible offerings and a blending of flavors you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.  We've been to both locations, but for whatever reason, prefer the 16th Street location over the Glendale location. Same food, same wonderful service - just personal preference.  Tacos: Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Oaxacan Black Mole, Chicken Asado. All excellent, super flavorful, seasonings not overpowering and well presented. The mole is probably the best I've ever tasted. Hint of cinnamon/spices, chocolate & chilies. Just the right blending of flavors to bring you back for more. Looking for something out of the box? Try the Arabe Burro. Al Pastor pork with hummus lettuce, cucumber and even some Tzatziki! Very refreshing. They also offer quite a number of vegetarian offerings.  La Santisima also boasts a homemade salsa bar unlike any you've seen. This really gives the customer the opportunity to try flavors and you just may find you've discovered a new favorite! The salsa made with peanuts is very good - really! And don't forget the adult beverage - the hand made house margarita is very good, too!  Restaurant is very unpretentious. Small in size. Glendale location has parking in the rear, street parking in Phoenix.  Neither location is close by our neighborhood, but worth the drive for great food.

I can't tell you how many times we've driven by this place and said we should try it. I SO wanted to like this place. It's in a non-descript mall that has been re-inventing itself for years and is still nothing to look at aesthically, so walking into The Grind is a bit of a shock to the senses. It's dark, trendy and kind of has an upscale feel to it. So far so good. It was busy, another good sign, and I'm having high expectations of this place. But they were short-lived.  We wanted to sit and enjoy our drinks for a while, but after the server asked us multiple times if we were ready to order, we decided we'd better do just that. I'm not sure where they had to go to prepare the food, but we waited an awfully long time for our burgers. When they arrived, we were all overwhelmed. The turkey burger was blah, tasteless and dry; the sweet & spicy burger as well as the steakhouse blt were overcooked. The sweet potato fries were limp and flavorless.  All this disappointment and super overpriced to boot! A lot of very good burger restaurants can be found in the Phoenix area - several in the general vicinity of The Grind! I hate to write off a place after the first visit (unless it's a major disaster) because it could just be a fluke. But having read some of the other reviews, I'm not sure our experience was a one-off. But it will be a while before I circle back to this place.

We tried to dine at this place a couple of months ago, and when told the hostess we didn't have a reservation, she kind of gave us "a look" - you know the kind! Like, how dare we even THINK of just walking and EXPECT to get seated. Can you say "Snotsdale"??? Well, we decided to go back...reservations made even though it was mid-week. We were so glad we gave it another go. First of all, the ambience is really cool - upscale feeling but sprinkled with humor. Upside down table lamps act as chandeliers - how fun is that???!!  And the name of many menu items is a great pairing of humor and song/artist, too. Great posters & artwork grace the walls; the wall colors are soothing. And, if a restaurant has "wine" in their name, you should expect to see their stash. Rhythm and Wine has a large glass wall displaying theirs. Nice.  Although they have a very nice patio area, it was during one of our cold snaps so we opted to eat inside. We had a great view of the sunset which was a plus. We were seated just before happy hour ended but our server squeaked in our order so we were able to have one glass of wine at happy hour prices ($3 off). Speaking of wine, they have an extensive list, but also have a full bar if wine isn't your choice of an adult beverage.  We split the "We go the Beet" salad - it was huge! More than two could eat. For entrees, we had the Chimichurri Marinated Flat Iron steak and Courtney Loves this Chicken pasta. The steak was sooo good and very flavorful. The chimichurri gave it a spice kick; it was perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. The pasta arrived in one of those neat slanted bowls. Again, pasta cooked perfectly and plenty of chicken that you didn't feel cheated. We are so glad we went back - it is definitely on our list to visit again.

We all get carpet cleaning coupons in the mail, or solicitation phone calls from companies offering a special. And, I dare say, we've all tried one of these "smokin' deals" (like 5 rooms cleaned for $50!!) and had soggy carpet for days.  Your search is over for a really great carpet cleaner. Cal named his company after a basic tenet of his: Integrity. Yes, his prices are a bit higher, but  this man knows his business. He spent 24 years at ServicePro doing restoration & cleaning, air duct cleaning, mold remediation etc. He now just concentrates on carpet (upholstery too). He spends a lot of time making sure the job is done right. He is a consumate professional, and his thoroughness and attention to detail that Cal displays is wonderful.   He calls the day after the job to make sure you are pleased - and if you aren't, he'll come back out. But trust me, he does such a great job, you'll be more than pleased.

We're typically not fans of chain restaurants but Seasons 52 is an exception. The selections are fresh and changes often. They pride themselves in offering dishes that are under 500 cal (but that adds up quickly if you get a starter, app, entr√©e & dessert!). The lamb kefta starter was very good - but could have used more tzatziki and Greek 'salsa'; the lumb crab roasted shrimp & spinach stuffed mushrooms were awesome! The spinach salad w/strawberries & pine nuts was also good, but lacking in the berry department. The stuffed Mediterranean sea bass was beautifully presented and prepared perfectly. There was live music from the bar area wafting through the dining areas which was a nice touch. The staff was super friendly and attentive. This is a restaurant of consistent high quality presentations and knowledgeable and friendly staff.

I love frozen yogurt and Zoyo has the best by far. Creamy and not crystallized at all like other places I've tried. There is always a great selection of flavors, all listing nutritional and dietary information. The standards (chocolate and vanilla) are always available, and other flavors change regularly. The oatmeal cookie and cake batter flavors really taste like their namesakes!  If you don't like to mix flavors, they even offer a divider for your cup! Zoyo also has a great selection of toppings, from fruits to nuts to sprinkles and candies. Love, love, love this place.

What a gem! All the positive reviews are spot on. Since the weather has finally reached the time where we can take advantage of sitting outside, we did. Not much of a view @ nite, but the patio is very nice & well-appointed. But the food/libations are the start. The shrimp scampi won't disappoint. Very flavorful sauce, a bit of a spice which was very nice. Zesty clams in white sauce was a hit, too. A lot of options on the menu from pastas to flatbreads to pizzas and salads. And the beer offerings & wine list are impressive as well. The place is owned by the same people who own Sacks & they take great pride in their culinary offerings. If you haven't been here, make it a priority! I know we'll go back, and often.

Stopped in before a Diamondbacks game for a quick nosh & drinks. The weather was great so we sat outside - the waitress was right there (and I mean right there in all her glory!!) to take our drink orders. After 1 round, we ordered a couple of starters which were very good and another round of drinks. Then she went missing. There were other patrons outside, too, and they were waiting for someone to wait on them. Finally, we caught an employee's eye and asked to get our bill. Very poor customer service.

Love the Bellini's!! And the food is always consistently good. Yes, you do have to wait if you go for dinner, but hey, if you have to wait, it's a great place to watch people....and you can always have a Bellini while you wait :-). Parking is slim, but Sears is just across the way and that parking lot is always empty so park there.  I am sorry that they don't offer whole wheat pizza crust anymore - Pleeeaaassse bring this back. We sat at the bar this visit, and the gal tending the area was very friendly and attentive. Even our 'neighbors' on the stools next to us were friendly - Oregano's is just a fun place - you can't help smile at all the t-shirt slogans! We're thrilled they opened up. PV mall used to be so nice and it has really gone down.

I'm not a big fan of the Fox Concepts restaurants, but his new venture at 40th St/Camelback is wonderful! It is billed as having a rustic, farmhouse atmosphere - I guess that explains the blue jeans and plaid, western-style shirts on the servers (really?? Isn't that better suited to a rustic, western atmosphere??) That said, the place does have a certain lively vibe and energetic atmosphere. They offer both inside and patio seating, although neither outside area offers a particularly nice view - either the parking lot or 40th Street and the shopping area across the street. But when the weather's nice, it's always a treat to eat outside.  We started with the bruschetta which was very, very good - a sign of more goodness to come! Our entrees included: spinach tortelloni, spicy shrimp and the pig pizza. The homemade spinach pasta was delicious and stuffed with mouth-watering cheese in a herb butter sauce. I could've done with about half the butter only because I'm not a butter fan, but must admit it was very flavorful. We were a little apprehensive that the shaved fennel on the spicy shrimp would be overpowering, but it wasn't at all. The dish was beautifully presented over homemade pasta and was very flavorful - worth ordering again! The pig pizza - so called because of its 4 pork meats - was good, too. The crust baked to perfection (no nasty burn areas).  Our service was fine - attentive, friendly and not hovering. This restaurant is in a great location and the complementary valet is a plus since the parking area is limited.  Definitely returning - sounds like a Sunday Happy Hour is in my future!

First time at this very popular place! We tried to get a seat on the back patio as the weather was beautiful - but it was a 45 min. wait! Our tummy's just couldn't wait that long so inside it was. But all was good. Our waiter was awesome. When we told him it was our first time at O.H.S.O., he gave us a 'tour' of the happy hour menu, explaining the beers, and just generally answered every question before we could ask.  The happy hour starter of thai-spiced hummus was so good! (I almost embarrassed myself by liking the bowl to get every last bit!) The beet salad followed, and as I usually do, I asked for the dressing on the side. It came with EVERYTHING on the side. I don't know if that's how they always serve it, but the spinach/greens on the plate, surrounded with little bowls containing the red and yellow beets, tomatoes, pecans, goat cheese, dressing. I piled everything on, drizzled on the dressing, and dug in. Very, very good. Fresh greens, the tomatoes tasted like tomatoes, beets yummy and the dressing flavorful. The brisket sandwich was huge! Half was taken home for lunch the next day. Flavorful bbq sauce. The menu indicates this this a staff choice and my son concurred! The spicy green chile pulled pork sandwich and jalapeno slaw was tasty, too! None left to take home, it was that good!  Good selection of beers and other libations. The flights are inexpensive and a great way to taste some of those beers you aren't too sure about!  Our waiter told us that another O.H.S.O is coming to the Paradise Valley Mall area...but didn't know when. That'll be awesome!   Another great find. Can't wait to go back!

Located in the historic Coronado district, this place serves up great BBQ and adult libations (albeit limited in offerings but how often do you see PBR on a menu??) in a quaint atmosphere. Simple, laid-back d√©cor, with some mid-century modern thrown in to pay homage to the neighborhood.   In an old house so you could easily miss it if you were looking for a large restaurant. Simplicity is the key here (the KISS principle at work): choice of beef, pork, fowl or sausage BBQ, either sandwich style or combo plate. You can't go wrong here - try them all! We went standard this visit - beef and port. Yum! The chimichurri potato salad was new to us and we are so glad we tried it! Cornbread good, too. Reluctantly shared the chocolate pecan pie bar - next visit I'm not sharing!  A new fav place for sure.

What a nice addition to this area of town! You don't necessarily expect to find an eating establishment of such high quality in a shopping complex. Rusconi's is nestled between a Panda Express & My Big Fat Greek. With the lack of street visibility, you just might just overlook this gem - look for the huge wooden entry door (which almost gives the appearance that the place is boarded up if you are just driving by).  One step inside, and you know right away that this is no ordinary strip mall eatery. Very inviting d√©cor, and beautifully decorated with and upscale feel, but not pretentious.   We didn't have a reservation - this was a weeknight and the place was busy! A couple of seats opened up at the bar so we opted for them instead of waiting. The bartenders greeted us right away and introduced themselves (Dave, Zack and "the new guy")  and started us off with our adult libations.   We skipped the starters and dove right into the entrees: Roasted Natural Chicken and Grilled Salmon. The salmon, with a wonderful blackberry glaze, was grilled to perfection. And delicious, too! When the chicken dish was delivered, I was told that the plate was very hot. And it was - at least half of it. And the food itself was lukewarm - tasty, but disappointing. I mentioned this fact and my dish was whisked away to be made right. When the next one was delivered, it was piping hot...and oh, so good! Chef Michael Rusconi's green chili mac 'n cheese is wonderful! The chili does not overpower the dish so you get a wonderful layering of flavors. The chicken was very moist and super-flavorful.  This is going to be one of our "go-to" places! Great ambience, delicious food, reasonable prices - what more can you ask for?

I never thought I would get a massage let alone get one regularly. But once I had my first massage at Elements, I was a convert! I am a member now and look forward to my monthly appointments. I also get an upgrade during my birthday month - a nice perk (I've had the hot stone massage which was great). When my husband started having some numbness in his arms, I suggested a massage. He reluctantly went, but after a couple of sessions, the numbness subsided. He now goes regularly, too. Slovika is the masseuse we see and in addition to being a Master masseuse, she is also a Reiki master if you're into that. Love, love, love Elements!

I love that more and more empty storefronts in strip malls are being re-purposed. And especially when a new eatery goes in, right?   Otro is the brainchild of Doug Robson of Gallo Blanco fame (another awesome restaurant in Central Phoenix) and showcases his amazing talent for preparing Mexican cuisine; but don't expect Otro to be a clone of Gallo Blanco. The space has a lot of exposed brick, and lots of windows/skylights. The kitchen is open to the dining area and there is an atmosphere of urban energy, yet comfortable and unpretentious.  A friend and I met up at Otro for lunch, and we both ordered the Asado Chicken Salad. This is not your average greens with sliced chicken breast....boring. This salad was packed with flavor. The spices on the grilled chicken was so flavorful, but not overpowering. The greens included spinach, shredded cabbage and romaine. There were chunks of apples which added a great texture and complimented the chicken. The dressing was a peanut vinaigrette which added another layer of flavor.  This is definitely a place worth returning to, either for a weekend breakfast, happy hour or dinner!

What a great neighborhood find! It is obvious this family owned business takes a great deal of pride in all they do - from the simple elegance of the interior space, to the professional staff and of course, in the excellence of their food.  You won't find a menu 'book' here, limited offerings - read: they concentrate on what they do well and do it well. The field salad was very large, almost entr√©e-size, and not drowning in dressing. I ventured outside of my box and ordered the roasted acorn squash w/burrata. There was a lot of burrata (Italian cheese made with mozzarella and cream), almost too much, but it was surprisingly good and I would have no qualms ordering it again.   For entrees we went with the flat-iron steak (cooked medium), and the appetizer meatballs. The steak was prepared perfectly! And tender..,and flavorful...and beautifully presented on top of a nest of fingerling potatoes. The appetizer meatballs were just the right amount (TIP: as tempting as it is, don't fill up on the delicious warm artesian bread they bring to the table!!) and delicious as well.  Being a loyal Yelper, I checked in when we arrived. Surprise: a free dessert!! We shared the Tiramisu - what can I say - it was light, heavenly, deliciously flavorful. Probably one of the best Tiramisu's I've had in a long, long, long time.  SOLO is on our list of places to go back to - and often.

We've wanted to try this place for a while and wish we hadn't waited so long! Great pizza! Love being able to choose the type of crust, sauce, & toppings I want - or, choose one of the menu items. We opted to go for the menu selections since it was our first visit. Spicy butcher lives up to its name - spicy! With hangover heat! But very flavorful. The margarita pizza was delicious. We're already thinking about what to get next visit.

Groupon brought us in, good food brings us back. Order one of their signature burgers, or build your own. We've done both. The signature Blu Burger came exactly as described, and cooked to perfection (medium). The onion bun was fresh and the side of onion rings were great. To build your own, select your burger (beef, turkey, bison, chicken, veggie, salmon, Portobello....), select the bun (you can even get a lettuce wrap), cheese, toppings, sauces and any specialty ingredients (egg, guacamole, ham....). I highly recommend the Kobe beef; it was so flavorful and that will probably be a go-to selection in the future. Must say I'm not overly impressed with the sweet potato fries, though. Hard to find good sweet potato fries it seems.   They do offer salads and sandwiches, but if they have "burger" in their name, you should at least try a burger. And with all of the options, why wouldn't you?  Family owned and operated - gotta love that! Fellow Yelpers, let's do our part to support family owned businesses! All in all, good food, nice staff. I recommend.

New place in the entertainment district of Scottsdale. Not your typical decor - more modern with blue neon lights under the bar, in the ceiling, and accented by blue walls. Very nice and calming atmosphere.  We started with the guac, chips and salsa and a couple of margaritas. We're a fan of spicy, so we pretty much devoured the spicy salsa and pushed  the medium salsa away. Spicy salsa wasn't overly spicy but did have a nice flavor. The guac came in a fried tortilla 'bowl' garnished with radish slices. It was chunky (onions, tomatoes, avocado) and was really delicious. House Margaritas were good - not overly sweet like so many restaurants tend to do.  When the name of the place has a food in it, you just have to order that food (especially if it's your first visit) so we opted for tacos: Barbacoa and Carne Asada. The refried beans looked really strange to me. Light in color and like a 'blob' on the plate - wasn't appetizing to me at all. I took a bite and didn't like them at all, but my husband thought they were great. Evidently they are not made from pinto beans, but a white bean, which is very traditional - that explains the light color. Both the barbacoa and asada were very flavorful. The tortillas were very fresh. The waiter later told us all the tortillas are made by hand on-site.  The staff was very friendly, stopped by several times to make sure our food was good, to fill our water glasses, bring us more chips, etc.  I definitely recommend. We're planning on taking out-of-town guests there in a few weeks.

Whenever a new restaurant opens, there are all kinds of kinks to work out, the biggest probably being service. I always try to take that into consideration and give the restaurant a little leeway. It seems management has taken to heart the poor Yelp reviews regarding service at this newly opened location. Our experience was tremendous. Friendly greeting the moment we walked through the doors on a Friday evening. We were seated promptly (arrived just before the rush as there was a wait shortly after we sat down.) Our server was quick to bring us water, welcomed us with a smile and asked if we had dined at Bonefish before.  We ordered some wine (the Spanish red was great!) and shared the crab cakes for a starter. They were very good and rich - large pieces of crab and very little filler. The red remoulade sauce had a nice kick to it.  Trout can easily be overcooked but the wood-grilled Rainbow Trout was moist and flaky. For those who aren't fish lovers (I know, then why go to a fish restaurant??? Don't even go there!), Lily's Chicken with goat cheese, artichoke hearts is very good. Both entrees came with a basil couscous which we could take or leave (our server did tell us this was going to be changing soon - smart move.) We both ordered the potatoes au gratin as our side, and they were mighty tasty! No room for dessert this visit but they all looked yummy.  By the time we left, the place was full. We had a wonderful experience and will definitely go back. The service was great, our server was affable, knowledgeable, considerate and attentive. He made sure everything met our expectations or surpassed them. The food was delicious and the ambiance was nice.  Welcome to the neighborhood. We're so happy to have a nice dining option close by.

Bummer - the place is permanently CLOSED as of April 4, 2016. Lasted just over a year. BYe bye Bang Bang Shrimp!! Evidently the parent company has decided to close at least 14 Bonefish Grill's across the US.

We've been to the Arcadia location and were excited when OHSO opened up another location further north. So glad something finally went into this space in the Whole Foods/Trader Joe's shopping center. It's been empty for years! We waited several weeks after it opened before trying it as we know that no matter how experienced restaurant owners are, it always takes time for the staff to gel and work out the kinks.  We stopped in mid-afternoon one Saturday, and there was still a 30-minute wait for a table! Lucky us, though, a couple of seats opened up at the bar! We only wanted a starter and drinks, so we ordered the Baja Shrimp cocktail. Bloody Mary and a Piehole Porter.  The shrimp cocktail is billed as "sharing for 2" but that seems a stretch. Plenty of chips, but skimpy on the shrimp cocktail portion. It was very flavorful. The Bloody Mary was absolutely the best ever! Oh, So good. It comes with a stick of homemade beef jerky instead of the standard celery stalk. Normally this would not impress me as I have never liked jerky - I just don't get it, I guess. But I'm here to tell you that you will never (I repeat, never) have any other beef jerky that tastes this good. Oh. My. Gosh. It is so delicious. And no, you can't just buy it separately (dang!) The Porter was good (too bad so said - it doesn't come with a piece of beef jerky!!)  Bartender was attentive - and super busy. The interior of the restaurant is small, but the outside seating is big with lots of orange lanterns. Corn hole games and dog friendly (how fun can it be for a dog, though? Why people feel the need to go out drinking with their pet is still a concept I have yet to grasp - but that's a topic for another place.)  We'll be back for a full meal one of these days, and we'll definitely be back for a bloody mary!
