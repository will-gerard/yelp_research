I had the green chile burger and my folks split a couple pizzas just this evening at le grande orange.  The pizzas were great and I love having mirror pond pale ale on tap.  The burger unfortunately did not live up to the hype.  Having just read an article about how this burger was the number two "gourmet burger" in town I came in with high hopes which were not reached.  I do not like burgers that fall apart and by about the third or fourth bite I was struggling to keep the thing together.  I had the freshly made english muffin for a bun and that may have been the mistake.  While the muffin is probably fantasic with some jam and butter, it did not work for the burger.    On my way out I grabbed a couple cookies and a strawberry cheesecake.  Both make up for any trouble I had with the burger.  I will be back to this place again, just not for the burger.

My dad has been going to this place quit awhile now.  I have been lucky enough to go with him a handful of times.  This place will make all Chicago sports fans proud.  A little too much Cubs stuff for a South sider like myself but the food makes it all worth it.  I had the sliders this last time and they were great.  The fries that went with were just as fantastic.  I can't wait till the next time my dad and I can go visit Bob and have a great Chicago experience in the middle of the desert.

This place is amazing.  The biscuits and gravey are my go to almost every time I walk in to that place.  Anybody who goes there needs to try this!   The breakfast burrito is a close second.  Having these two items on the menu makes me think gaining weight and eating both may be worth it.    The bagels are a great way to go as well.  They have very good cream cheese and the bages are always very fresh.

With a great selection of beers on tap, always having a fantastic seasonal beer and a wide variety of great food I could go here three or four times a week!  The salmon sandwich is one of my favorites and it goes great with an 8th street ale (which I happen to be drinking now) along with pretty much any other thing they have on tap.  Start with the wings or nachos and you will not be disappointed.    It's a great place to watch any sporting event.  A few too many Vikings fans for my liking, being a Bears fan myself but it's a great atmosphere for pretty much any time you're looking to have a memorable experience.

The bacon and cheese breakfast burrito is top notch.  The thick pieces of delicious bacon spread throughout to be enjoyed in every bite is a wonderful touch.  The cheese holds the the whole thing togther making every bite as good as the one before.  The salsa does well to compliment while not overpower the essence of the meal.

Worst Pizza Ever! They just lost a customer and with service like that Vincent's is on its way to being just another one of those short-lived restaurants near the I-10 and Ray.  I called in for the $19.99 one-topping  pizza and wings special and decided to upgrade to the bbq chicken pizza for $7.  Terrible decision because their bbq sauce and chicken are awful, but the crust is so terrible it wouldn't really matter what was on top of it.    So I called in to possibly get a different pizza sent out and I got to talk to Jack.  Maybe he is a cook trying to act like a manager but he certainly lacks any sort of customer service skills.  His offer to me was half off a new pizza.  Half off a pizza that I paid extra for, which I was ok with only to find out the bbq chicken pizza is only sauce, chicken and cheese.  That sounds like the one-topping pizza special that i ordered.

I've been here a couple of times and it is always seems to be the same.  The first half of my burger is great! Then the bun begins to crumble and fall apart.  This leaves me with an ugly mess on the wrapping in front of me and really just disappointed.    I have no complaints about the fries, they are actually very good.  The Cajun fries especially.  I only wish they had cheese fries.  Damn that yahoo article that told me otherwise...

Do not use these guys they are useless! Dan will not return your calls and will over charge your card and charge you for things he never told you about.   There have to be better services around.    Just the other week after the big dust storm I called Dan up and let him know my pool was having some issues.  He let me know his techs were busy taking care of new customers.  That's weird, I've been paying 90$ a month for the past 7months, yet they get service first.  Even on the normal scheduled Wednesday visit i received a call to let me know they could not even come out that day.  Two days later, my pool brown as ever, he came and  left the chemicals and took off.  Don't worry Dan I'll sweep the pool and take care of the rest of the things your tech is supposed do.  Oh it gets better...he charged my card an extra 80$ saying it was a special service call.  Yet no one  had not come out for my regularly scheduled visit that week.  An extra 80$ to have the tech come out two days late....what a great deal.    I do not have a good pool company to recommend.  If anybody else does please let me know.  I've written a lot of reviews and been in the Phoenix area all my life.  A company like this will not last.        Don't listen to the good reviews on this page.  It's made up, she works there.

It took him a year to respond to my post and this is some sort of back handed apology I think...for some reason stating that I have a low income or that I am on a fixed budget.  I see there are a whole two positive reviews on here! Wow...  There are a lot of pool companies in the phoenix area.  Im not trying to refer anyone in particular but I would guess there are many better than this one.  This all came from one bad experience.  The explanation of the experience I gave was correct.  The situation was handled very poorly by dan and this response to a post on yelp, which had a few more lies in it, just calls his character into question a little more.  I've left this alone for a year now, I had one bad experience and explained it just to let other people know of what I went through.  That is the reason yelp is here Dan, to give examples of good and bad experiences.  You responding in this way just shows your lack of integrity and capabilities as a business owner.  If you do use this company good luck and I really do hope dan has improved on on the way that he conducts his business because all I see is lies and trying to cover up the mistake that he made in past.  I thought this was over but him questioning my integrity is not right.  His pool tech never came by that week to find a locked gate, he simply did not show.  He did over charge me and became very defensive upon me even asking about it.      I just can not believe he would say some of those things that he did in his response.  It is very disappointing that a childish response to my one year old post was something that dan felt he needed to do.

What a great place!  I spend way too much money here on a weekly basis.  I believe I have tried nearly everything and have yet to be dissappointed.  My advice is to try it all and enjoy!

I've eaten at Rudy's in TX and was very happy to have them right here in Chandler and provide a little competition for my always delicious Honey Bears.  They do very well in comparison.  Their quality of meat is incredicle, much better than HBs, and the fact they let you sample the different types is great.  The BBQ sauce is very good as well.  I do prefer the memphis style BBQ sauce of Honey Bears but Rudy's is still very good as an alternative.  The beans and the potato salad are the only two sides I have tried thus far.  Both of them were very good.  My only complaint is the lack of fries or mac and cheese.  I am not sure what the reasoning is for not having these items.  I am sure they would do a great job on them based on everything else they have.  I've had breakfast here once and was impressed.  I will be back again for that.  Brisket, eggs and bbq sauce go very well together.

I've only eaten here once and usually I give things a second chance but I doubt I will this time.  The pizza tasted like it was from the frozen pizza section in the bashas that is in the same parking lot...and not even one of the decent frozen brands.  The bacon and sausage on top were pathetic looking and tasted the same.  The whole pizza left much to be desired.    I was also not to thrlled about the younger cook using his bare hands to toss the pizza dough in the air.  Hopefully I am not the only one bothered by that.      This was a take out order and after I had paid I asked for ranch.  The manager said the ranch dressing is usually 30cents per container but this time would be free.  I guess I am not a restaurant owner but charging for ranch seems a bit tough.  Especially thinking how much money must be made on that mark up if you do sell a lot of it.

What a great combination of great food and service!  It was an unexpectedly busy Sunday, 8/16, night yet the manager handled it like a pro.  As is was my birthday my Father had come in earlier in the day asking to reserve a table and the manager said 'no need, we will have plenty of space tonight'.  Whoops...Yet the Sunday night manager rectified everything quickly and with a smile.  The food was delicious, and this is the second time I have been here and they are 2 for 2.  I have no doubt they will be 3 for 3 after my next visit for some of those nachos and a beast burrito....also Victory IPA on tap, nice work.

A winning combination of great food and excellent customer service!  My father and I each had a Machaca burrito and the manager let us sample the green chile pork.  Everything was delicious.  I will be back.  I did not even try the food item in the name of the restaurant and was still pleased.  Great work people!
