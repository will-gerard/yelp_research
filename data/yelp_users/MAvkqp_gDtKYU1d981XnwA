You won't be disappointed. We've eaten here about 7 times now, and we are ALWAYS delighted. The Beef Panang is just killer. The strips of beef are incredibly tender and of high quality. I usually find that the strips are a perfect medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love.  Personally, my favorite is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely the best here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious and refreshing. The duck sauce that comes with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me happy.  Appetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip these as they cost as much as the entrees.   Another note: don't come here thinking this is 100% authentic Thai cuisine. It's definitely Thai...but upgraded. In my opinion, it's perfect. It's also a good place to take someone on his or her first taste of Thai.

Called in another order earlier this week. It was ready when I got there. As always, the food was amazing. I'm still trying to figure out how they have beef of such incredible quality. They cook it perfectly. Just awesome. One nitpick- dinner costs more than lunch but you don't get a spring roll with it? Come onnnnn! Just throw one in the bag. I won't tell!

Repulsive. It's plain white rice with Teriyaki sauce and some disgusting bits of chicken. I made the mistake of not ordering the bowl "white meat only" and ended up with a bowl of fat, gristle, skin, cartilage, and odd-tasting bits that I couldn't identify. This is a $6 bowl of disgusting crap. I'm told that the "white meat only" option is important. I don't care. Nobody should serve that, ever.   If you want a decent teriyaki bowl that won't make you want to vomit, go to Costco and get their frozen bowls. I can't remember the brand, but it's got veggies, delicious white meat (with a lot of flavor), rice, and sauce. It comes out to about $1.30 per bowl.   I'm eager to finish this review so that I can stop thinking about that disgusting bowl. So that's all.

YES!!! I am really impressed with this place. Three of us arrived on a Friday night and had a 30 minute wait. We were all exhausted and starving, but we couldn't wait to try a new place. We had a beer while we waited and were seated on time. The place is cozy, and the staff is super friendly.   We started with the cheesy garlic bread. My friends were not excited until they tried it. Oh WOW, it's bursting with flavor. That cheese, that sauce, that garlic, that crunch. Oh. SO. GOOD.  Then we carried on and had their meaty pizza (can't remember the name). It was friggin' amazing! The Italian beef was a really great touch that I didn't anticipate. The sausage had a delightful flavor and wasn't too fennel-y. The sauce is what landed the pizza in my dreams last night. It's a sweet sauce (which might be new to some). It's very close to some great St. Louis style pizzas I've eaten. The crust is crunchy and it's delivered brilliantly on a wire rack (to maintain the crunch). All I can say is: EAT HERE, thank me later.

Get the fish! Skip the chips! Few things are better than a made-to-order, hand-breaded, fresh, fish sandwich. This catfish filet was NOT frozen. The cornmeal breading was very crunchy. Cooked perfectly. Light, flaky, NOT greasy at all. Just a perfect sandwich all around. Get this, the combo plate was only $6.50. Seriously? Awesome.  When asked if I wanted hot sauce or mayo on the sandwich, I replied, "both." BEST DECISION EVER! The hot sauce adds the necessary flavor to the mildly seasoned breading while the mayo provides the creaminess that a tartar sauce adds without the overwhelming tartar flavor. (Note: I'm not a big tartar sauce fan b/c it hides the flavor of the fish).  So, skip the fries. They're just frozen potatoes that don't taste like anything. I'm still giving Mandy's 5 stars, because the sandwich was truly exceptional. And honestly, didn't come for the fries. But ask them which sides are made on site. The onion rings and fried okra are probably good.   PS-don't worry about it being catfish. It's seriously good. PPS-I grew up around a LOT of fish fries in Kentucky. No catfish has ever been this good. GO!

Go to Pei Wei and have the same food for less money. Dry rice, too-sweet sauces, dry & flavorless beef, oversalted everything. Don't pay for it. Pei Wei is just as awful for less.

Seriously good, authentic food. You can't go wrong with the chicken or the steak. Please go (and ignore the decor). CASH ONLY!!!!

This is terrible food. I've had some not so great Chinese food before, but this place is by far the worst. It doesn't help to call it "asian" to avoid authenticity complaints. It's just bad. The beef must have been soaking in soy sauce for a week. I love salty food, but I developed hypertension after eating here. The sweet sauce in the "General Chi" style (whatever that is) was entirely too sweet to pass for anything. The beef was very tough and completely overcooked. The Orange chicken was the only mildly redeeming dish because I could eat more than a few bites without being overwhelmed with salt or sugar. I don't mean to overstated this: it was the worst meal I've had in Phoenix.

We had a really nice time here. The place is small. I was immediately impressed when I saw the wood-fired pizza oven. The owner served us personally and couldn't have been nicer. We had a pizza with mozzarella, meatballs, and sausage. The pizza had really excellent flavor, and I was very impressed with the quality of the meatballs. The little char on the crust from the wood oven was magical.   My only complaint is that we didn't leave totally stuffed. We got the 2nd largest pizza, but the pizza is so flat that it isn't too filling. The other dishes and appetizers were really expensive, so we didn't get anything else. We aren't competitive eaters or anything, we just like to be full and have some leftovers. Am I greedy? Maybe.   It was delicious, so we would definitely go back. Next time, we'll get two, smaller pizzas. That would be good.

The second-best yellow curry in the valley. Came in for lunch, received excellent service. But, my main priority is the food. The spice is spot-on, but it doesn't quite have the depth of flavor that Wild Thaiger's yellow curry has. Check it out for a speedy lunch if you want a break from the usual lunch humdrum.

Underwhelming gyro. There are french fries with it? First question: why? Second question: why are they not any good? I will say one good thing, it was cheap, and I didn't leave hungry.

What a magnificent restaurant! After four exceptional visits, I decided it was time to show some love. The food is a knockout, the service is always friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is pitch-perfect. I always feel like I'm at a great dinner party in the fabulous home of a great local chef. Let's talk food: 1. Cheese Curds - Basically the best fried things ever. At $5, just get them and laugh at the idiots eating something by the same name at Culver's. 2. Brussel Sprouts - I can't remember the exact description, but they were crazy good. My boyfriend and I actually had to bargain for the last spoonful. 3. Stuffed Medjool Dates - That perfect melding of sweet/rich/spicy/salty. I wanted more, but I maintained my composure because the entree arrived as we ran out. 4. Pork Tenderloin - This was perfection. Tender/perfectlycooked/juicy/flavorful/gorgeous grilled tenderloin. I thought I'd had great pork, but I was sorely mistaken. The sweetness from the date butter was just unbelievable. I've had my share of pork with some sort of apple concoction. That's all fine and good, but nothing has ever come close to this. I can't wait to go back to have this dish again. 5. Chicken & Waffles - The ultra-crunchy breading on the most perfectly cooked piece of chicken ever. As a boy from Kentucky, I can't say that this was the best fried chicken of my life, but it absolutely ranked among the greats. (Actually, I might give the crown to Arrogant Butcher on their fried chicken night). The white cheddar waffle is unlike anything I've had. Crazy addictive and strange. Highly recommended 6. Ribs Special - So here is where I felt that I could have passed. They were very good ribs, but they weren't in the realm of Earth-shattering. Although, I am unfairly comparing them to the best joints in Memphis. 7. Bread Pudding - silent weeping with one hand raised to the heavens. Praise. 8. Beet Chip Spinach Salad - What fun! Just loved the balance flavors and textures. Great salad to get for the table and share.  The thing about Tuck Shop is that they take a food that you think you know, and they make it better than you thought it could ever be.

Bruschetta=love. I can never remember which ones I had last time, but I always end up with a delicious board. I'm not a big wine guy, so the decent beer list makes me happy!

So, I dig this place. The burrito meats were freshly cooked, not dried-out, and not overcooked. The queso was a delicious addition, but I'm sad that it was a $1 extra. Sure, the fresh tortilla is great, but I'm far more impressed by "the mixer." Once they put all of the ingredients on the tortilla, they mix it all up with a little spatula so that every bite is uniform. I gotta say, this is genius. I don't like burritos many times, because you get whole bites of one thing or another. This is a brilliant extra. Can you other burrito places do this too?

You can't get a better latte in Phoenix than at a Cartel. That's just a fact. Even more impressive is their unbelievably great food. Turkey sandwich, awesome. The freaking spring mix side salad, amazing. What really blew me away was the bacon, (fantastically runny) egg, and onion jam sandwich. I've actually been back 3 times just to get this sandwich. I don't really care for drinking espresso with this sandwich, so I hope that they start carrying some bottled drinks or something.   In addition to the deliciousness, know that this is one of the most affordable lunches in downtown PHX. I don't know what most of these restaurants are doing charging so much for so little (I'm looking at you, Chloe's Corner), so it's refreshing to find a place that does amazing food for a reasonable price.

This is the best burger in Phoenix. Sorry, Delux, you didn't cook my burger to order the last 2 times I went (and by that I mean I order medium rare, and the burger came out medium well to well done. Come on, that is way too expensive to be cooking half of the burger well done!).   But let me be clear, this is a superior burger even on Delux's good day. The Grind's burger is unbelievably tender and juicy, but it also maintains a great beef flavor. I've been twice so far, and both times the burger was a perfect medium rare. This is the kind of burger that doesn't need a single topping. You can cut it and eat it like steak. Frankly, it's better than most of the steaks out there. The fries are fantastic.  The doughnuts are very good, but I'm not a big sweets person. Oh, and you should probably skip the onion rings. Cooked perfectly, but the liquid batter is really bland. Just get the fries.  This is also far superior to Zinburger. Don't waste your money there. Go to The Grind!

Adrian is the MAN! This is the best men's cut in Phoenix, hands down. I started going to Adrian when he was at Boxers Men's Salon down the street, and now I won't let anybody else cut my hair. I've been to a number of salons, but nobody can hold a candle. My partner cuts his own hair, because he says everybody butchers it. "Not everybody can do black hair," he says. Well, Adrian can and did. Now he goes every two weeks.   Also, the place is much nicer than Boxers. Very clean place, very nice staff. I haven't tried any of their other services, but people seem happy when they're done.  GO SEE ADRIAN!

You have to love this place. I'm not good with the catchy names, but I'll describe what I had. It was the chili cheese dog with cole slaw on top. The all beef hot dog was truly the star of the show, but the hearty vegetable chili stood up pretty well to the dog. The cole slaw was sweet and delicious (and I don't even like cole slaw). It cut right through the fatty richness of the rest perfectly. I couldn't really taste the monterey jack cheese, but that's ok. Still delicious.  But the FRIES! Oh, get the fries. It's hard to find a place that makes fresh-cut fries that successfully. I think the only improvement would be if they used peanut rather than vegetable oil. But still, the fries are super good!  I'm dying to try the burgers after the excellent showing on the hot dogs. Great work!

Today is a sad day. My partner and I went to Maui Dog for the ALWAYS good dogs and fries. They were already closed. This was one of my top 5 meals in Phoenix. Consistently excellent. We will miss you very much. I hope that you find a new home in central Phoenix! Say, Melrose District?

I was there for lunch on a Saturday. It was fantastic in every way. The porchetta sandwich was brilliant. Would recommend splitting the porchetta sandwich with a pizza with friends. We has the Casanova Pizza. It was incredible. The pizza was like a four-part harmony with the fig as the soprano soaring over the chord. The pecorino served as a nice and sharp bass note while the rest melded together beautifully. Top 3 pizza in my life.   Had a wine cooler. Interesting, but I should've known that I wouldn't want all of that sweetness. Much more of a beer guy. Speaking of, you must get the Sierra Nevada Hefe. It's one of the best I've ever had.  Beautiful restaurant, happy people that care about the food. This is a must.  (Sorry for the shoddy writing, I tapped this out on my phone)

Today marked my 4th time here in a month. I was addicted from day one! (Check my pictures to see a few of the dishes. The pictures do not do the food justice)  Breakfast/Brunch (Now open on weekends for brunch) 1. The New York Breakfast Sandwich (grilled sourdough, 2 eggs, 2 strips of bacon or ham, cheese and mayo) is great! Delicious bacon, fluffy eggs, and the best bread you could possibly imagine. That sourdough is the reason I came back. They griddle the bread so that it's extra crispy on the outside. I can't say enough about it. Get something with the sourdough. 2. Blueberry Pancakes: truly some of the best pancakes around. Light and crispy, fluffy, sweet and vanilla-y. The blueberries are delicious. You won't be disappointed. 3. Biscuits 'n Sausage Gravy: Excellent!!! This really is a meal by itself. Sure, you can get some of their delicious shredded hash browns on the side (don't mind if I do), but these are great. Very elevated form of the dish, not some lumpy mystery sauce (check my photo). The sausage was legit, the gravy was perfect, and the biscuits were killer. My suggestion is that they serve some breakfast sliders on those biscuits. They could invent a whole new thing! And yeah, only $4.50.  4. Croque Monsieur: You-can't-believe-it-till-you-try-it. This is a new item that is a part of their new weekend brunch. Get some over easy eggs on top and thank me tomorrow. This is absolutely TO DIE FOR. (And yeah, it's on top of that amazing sourdough I mentioned earlier) 5. Blueberry muffin: my first foray into their pastries. Yup, delicious with a hint of orange citrus that will leave you going, "is that? oh....that's good." 6. French toast: meh, skip. It's the sort of french toast that you can probably make at home. Good? Yes. But you have so many, better options.  Lunch 1. Brisket Sandwich: If you're here for lunch, stop reading. Just order the brisket sandwich. The caramelized onions, the sourdough, the brisket roast, sigh. It's just perfect. (Try their house balsamic with a side salad) 2. Grilled Cheese: so here is where I have an issue. My better half had the option of monterey jack, cheddar, and american. He chose American cheese. Look, I get it, it reminds you of your crappy grilled cheese from childhood, but it just doesn't work. Listen to me and get the monterey jack or cheddar. The American is just sad and sorry on that fantastic sourdough. Together, we can beat nostalgia. 3. Pastrami reuben: It's a great reuben. I just keep forgetting that I'm not a big reuben fan. It always sounds like a good idea, and then I'm disappointed that it's exactly what it should be. If you like reubens, this will make you very, very happy.  This is my new favorite place to eat in Phoenix. Reasonable prices, clean, friendly staff, and, most important of all, fantastic food!!!!   See you there!

We came here for happy hour. I took a bunch of pictures. The one thing I did NOT get a picture of, is the bacon burger. This is devastating, because this is one of the BEST THINGS I'VE EVER EATEN. They have the audacity to grind the beef WITH the bacon, so it's all inside. You can't imagine the flavor, the juiciness, the all-out delicious warfare happening in your mouth. Just go for happy hour, get the burger and fries, and thank me later.  The curry cauliflower was just divine. Of course, I'm a little partial to everything yellow curry, but this was my favorite side dish of the night. I really enjoyed the fried ribs, but you need to prepare yourself to get your face involved. They're hard to eat, but tasty. It's a minor complaint for me.   Oooh, the pommes frites (french fries) were soooo good. Dipping sauces: check!  A word of caution: all of those items add up fast. So, if you order like a rock star, be prepared when the bill comes.

Wonderful place for breakfast downtown. The breakfast sammy (see photo) was more heavenly than I thought it could be. I don't know how those eggs were so fluffy, the bread was so great, and the cheese was so rich, but it was amazing. My suggestion: get it and split it with a friend. Neither of us could eat more than half.  Also, the atmosphere is just perfect for a Phoenix morning. I'm eager to go back and try more!
