I needed to print some business cards and flyers for my client's  Luxury Clothing Store Grand Opening, I had very little time to finish it and I went to Markit Media Scottsdale. The staff was super friendly and helpful, quality was very high and the prices were lower then anywhere in town. I'm very glad that I went there, now I'm regular happy customer.

Great gym! People are very focused and on the mission to workout. Lots of people are in amazing shape, that is very motivating. There are a lot of people who you can ask for advice, most people know what are they doing.   If you need more then just advice, then get a trainer. I had very positive experience with Gregg Block. He is an amazing, sweet, great, open-minded, and has very nice positive energy.

Location of the store is great! :) Camelback and 44th street is very convenient.   Its great store if you are an old grandmother or if you are looking for a present for grandmother!!  I'm European woman, who used to high quality clothes, what you definitely will not find in this store. You also will not be able return your item for cash, only for store credit.    Very disappointed!

The best Night/Day club in town. Lots of great DJs (Calvin Harris, Morgan Page, Nervo etc) The setup is beautiful! In summer there are best pool-parties! Lots of nice and beautiful people come to this club! ;)
