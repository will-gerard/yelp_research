Went there on a Friday afternoon.  Wasn't busy at all, yet our service was incredibly slow.  The waitress was a sweetheart, but they were obviously under-staffed.  I ordered a sandwich with added-on onion rings for $1, but they brought me FOUR burnt, way-overcooked onion rings.  After I pointed this out to the waitress, she said "Oh well, they weigh them out, that's how the come."  No offer to bring new ones, no comp off of our bill for the up-charge, despite them being totally inedible.  The place obviously needed a good cleaning as everything was sticky and had cigarette ash all over the tables and chairs.  Also, being served with silverware and napkins is usually helpful, which they did not do, so we just stared at our food while they took 5+ minutes to bring out our silverware.  Oh well, never again will I eat here!

I will never take my dog to another vet besides Dr. Heather Riedy ever again!  She has a big heart, always knows what to do and treats my dog with great care!  If you love your animals and want them to be treated by intelligent and thorough doctors, take them to Dr. Riedy at the Scottsdale Veterinary Clinic!

Love their food, patio, and of course, the prickly pear frozen margarita.  Perfect end to our long hike up in Carefree.

Love this place!!  Amazing food, staff, drinks, music, and environment!  It was super busy but they got us in and the quality of the food was amazing.  Our server was hilarious and very attentive.  Beer selection was fantastic and their beer brewed in-house was delicious!  We may have to become regulars!

Dr. Trinka and Dr. Kristen are phenomenal chiropractors and are extremely attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.  Sara, the office manager, is incredibly attentive as well and such a pleasure to see.  All of the assistants, front desk workers and massage therapists are knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and kind!  I love visiting Goodyear Chiropractic!

Great service, food was perfect and drinks were definitely cold! Good beer selection. Thanks CBCB! We will be back!   If possible though, I'd love it if they got a sour beer on tap or available in bottle/can.... I know some AZ breweries have some delicious ones.

Me and a friend stopped by there last night and was very happy with the food, service and wine!  They were prompt and friendly.  The food was delicious, and we took advantage of a deal where you could share a salad, get your own 10 inch pizza, a glass of wine each and share a dessert for like 33$!  It was a cute, quiet environment with great food and service.  You should definitely try it out.  Great for date night.

Ken came to our house and fixed multiple issues as the house is a rental and we just moved in.  He was kind, helpful, and he got everything done with quality work.  We will definitely be using them again and will most definitely be using them again.
