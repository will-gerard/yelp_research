You can tell this place is under new management! Mike the manager was outstanding! We purchased a battery from another store (which died, hence the reason for the visit)and came in with no receipt. He helped us immediately and even installed the new battery for us at no charge. He suggested we get a new connector (which we knew we needed), but didn't try to upsell us, instead warning us that it could cause problems later. We will absolutely be back. In fact my husband purchased 4 new tires for my Prius there and I'm saving even more in gas now. Very satisfied customer! Thanks, Mike!

They did it again! Mike and the guys at Pep Boys continue to impress me! One of my new tires got a nail and guess who fixed it for me? This place is my new go-to place for all my car needs. Their customer service is simply outstanding!!  Thanks Mike, I am so grateful!

I love Robert's Catering!  Robert is catering an event for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in September and has gone out of his way to make sure the menu is just right for our budget.  He even threw in his FAMOUS cakes!  Robert really looks out for his community and there is a reason he is known around town for his incredible food!  Thanks, Robert!

By far one of my favorite places to go.  I'll make this easy for you, the Chicken Chipotle Pasta will change your life.  Go.

Gotta admit, this is a great place for take out.  Our whole office orders from them and they are quick, yummy and cheap.  It's our go-to take out place!

Incredible customer service!!  Allison and Stephanie there are amazing!  I work for a charity and they did the best they could to help me fulfill my order while staying within my budget.  They even offered to ship things for me to save me money!  I will definitely be back and it's only because of people like them!  Well done!

I cannot say enough good things about AutoZone! This one in particular has always been very helpful. Yesterday Ishmel helped me and my husband by saving us money (it was just the battery, whew!). Not only did he charge the battery for us for free, but ran checks on the starter, alternator, etc... for free as well. What amazing customer service. Ishmel was so helpful, we will definitely be back!

Poppa Maize Gourmet Popcorn is incredible!  Not only do they have a billion flavors to choose from, they are SO NICE!  I work in events and they have sponsored events for The Boys & Girls Clubs of the East Valley as well as The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  I also know they do several charity events a month!  What a wonderful (and super tasty!) addition to our community!

Mojo is awesome!  Not only did they just inform me that my office (The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society) just won an office party from them, but they have 50% off every Tuesday with the secret word!  Love it!

This place is pretty awesome!  They have Reese's Pieces yogurt, need I say more?  You can also download their iPhone app.  Bring up the coupon and show it, that easy!

I love this place for lunch!  My favorite is the grilled cheese with a side salad and the bottled Diet Coke (this alone makes me want to go there).  It's a cozy little house, so be prepared for a crowd. :)

My new favorite place!! It's a little hidden treasure that you would never guess has so much heart! Joann is the main cook and is SO sweet. Made me some of her Pad Thai and I'm now constantly craving it. My fiance was in love with the Orange Shrimp and Green Curry.   For $9.99 a person, it's a steal. Oh, and you know how everyone keeps saying their dessert is outta sight? It's true! Coconut and Pineapple ice cream? YUM!  Can't wait to go back!  p.s. The service is top notch and they really go out of their way to make you feel special, quite rare these days!

I love Sonoran Studios and refuse to use another AV company in town!  Neil Schneider and his team are incredible and go above and beyond for each event.  My events look polished, elegant, expensive (but not!), and the flow is amazing.  Neil can also design videos and slides for you!  His videos are wonderful for emotional appeals and make me cry each time!  The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society can't wait to use Sonoran Studios for all of our upcoming events!

I had such high hopes for the Herb Box yesterday. I posted a picture of your Kobe Burger on my FB page telling everyone how excited I was to try it. We were there celebrating my sister's 40th birthday party and twelve women were out in honor of their friend. We assumed it was normal that they let us get settled without taking drink orders, but it was quite awhile until someone came over. We ordered our drinks and got them about 15-20 minutes later (not sure how long it takes to make a diet coke, but ok). When we asked the manager where our server was to take our order, he said that we were busy "gossiping" and that's why our order wasn't taken. This was the manager, Paul. Gossiping? Seriously? We are a group of 40 and older women, please calm down Paul. If you'd like us to gossip, I'm sure we can gossip about our bad service from this restaurant. We arrived at 10am, got drinks by 10:45am and by 11:30 we were still waiting for food. I had to go up to the bar twice to get a refill of soda and they screwed up one order of food and completely FORGOT another person's order. It's 12 people, I used to work in a restaurant. There were hardly any other patrons and they staff was too busy giving each other massages at the hostess stand to worry about tending to their customers. We spent $20 a meal plus drinks and a $70 cake, I expect far better service. I will tell everyone I know to skip this place and head to a restaurant that is more worried about tending to it's paying customers than trying to act as if they are too cool to care.

I should preface this review with the statement that I worked in the event industry for 14 years and have worked with over 50 DJ's in that time. Never have I come across someone so rude, unprofessional, and condescending as Patrick. As a paying customer, you expect some level of respect, but Patrick Riedlinger refuses to come down off his high horse to give you any. I should also say that I was about as NON-bridezilla as you could get. I never had issues with ANY other vendors except for Patrick. He is by far the worst vendor I have ever come across in my 14 years.   Pre-wedding issues:  -          Patrick tried to overcharge me several times. Once for the venue ($2k!), three times for the linens, and then for beverage dispensers he said I could use. Please keep in mind that I paid and used THEIR vendors (DJ, flowers, photographer, linens) and he still gave me attitude like he was giving me a discount.  -          When I asked him to use a free music program called Spotify to play my music playlist, he refused, saying he had all the songs.   -          He then sent me his DJ planner sheet to fill out (which apparently he never read, which I will get to during the "day of issues"). He never got in touch with me and basically only responded about money or when I wrote him several times.  -          Patrick, the "event manager" didn't even bother to show up for the rehearsal.    Day of issues:  -          Patrick, the "event manager", refused to help set up for my wedding even though we paid for the venue and the event manager  -          Patrick not only gave my helpers attitude, but he would not help them when he was asked to get something or show someone where something was. -          He was playing circus music when people were setting up and when my maid of honor asked him to play my playlist, he said he never got one from me.  -          He scowled at my father and mother and did not even say HELLO to me. I'm not expecting a "you look pretty in your dress" or anything like that, but not even a hello?  After paying you $700 for 4 hours of your time?  On my wedding day?  -          We repeatedly told him that my husband is from a foreign country and had NO family here. During the introductions he continued to ask our guests who was on the groom's side. You could hear crickets.  How many different ways can you tell someone the same thing? -          He did not play the mother/son dance -          He did not play the Ken/Barbie game -          He did not do the bouquet toss until someone mentioned it to him and by that time all the single women had left -          At 9:30pm announced to everyone that the party was over and the bar was closing. We had the venue until 11pm and the OPEN bar was wide open. Who tells people to leave a wedding??? -          He was rude to several guests who came up to me to complain about him -          Several people said that he was a horrible DJ and he wasn't trying at all. Then when he spoke, he was trying TOO hard, like he wasn't comfortable in front of people.  -          He never got the crowd going or laughing. The whole point of a DJ is to get the crowd excited and dancing. He played the songs HE wanted to play and didn't care about the playlist, which had songs on there that meant a lot to us. -          Several people commented on his attitude. Obviously Patrick does not enjoy his job, nor is he good at it. This is apparent with his attitude and comes across in his performance. When you are in charge of the energy of the party, you fake it. Even if you're in a bad mood, you fake it.  For the most important day in someone else's life, you fake it for 4  1/2 hours. I'm glad that I had an awesome support group to hide me from his nastiness because that really would have put a damper on my day. I fear for any bride that doesn't have that, because he could easily ruin the happiest day of your life.   I would never, ever recommend Patrick Riedlinger or Platinum Day Entertainment to anyone. He is not only a waste of money, but his attitude could very easily ruin your event/wedding.  For $700 you could get another DJ that will make your wedding day one to remember. Music can do so much for an event and I regret being pressured by the owners of Shenandoah Mill to use Patrick. Please stay far, far away from him and invest your hard-earned money elsewhere.

We found this place last night after going to the movies.  Score!  It's within walking distance from the house and their Peanut Butter is out of this world!  We will be back, again and again!!    Anyone know their hours?  They should get on facebook! :)

I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. First, it's family owned and you can tell. A lovely husband and wife run the restaurant and his father cooks homemade Pho all day. The service is incredible. I go here for meetings and we usually spend 2 hours at least (today almost 4!!!) and not only do they welcome us, but they chat with us, give us free appetizers, refill our drinks all the time and suggest wonderful food for us. I've had the Beef Pho, Shrimp Fried Rice, Pad Thai, Chicken Chow Mein, and the Mongolian Beef and EVERYTHING was terrific. I'm so glad I stumbled up this wonderful little restaurant. I want it to stay my secret place, but it's too good not to share and I wish a thriving future for the owners. Go here, you will not regret it!

You know, I like their food, but they always get our order wrong. It's been SEVERAL times. No apologies when you call and tell them. With all the new business in Gilbert we tried to give them another chance, but perhaps Pomo and Oregano's will be our go-to places.

Jasmine at the store in Chandler just rocked my fashion world! I got every single thing I needed for a very important business trip coming up and I was so frantic! In less than two hours, I got everything down to the shoes. WOW! It was so much fun and really great prices with the sales. I'm definitely going out of my way to go back to this store and see Jasmine again. Just incredible customer service and I couldn't be happier! Thanks, Jasmine!
