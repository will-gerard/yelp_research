A solid experience at the Pig..not sure why its called that but I bought two bikes and was given a host of info and prompt service. I felt like these guys care enough to take care of you after the purchase. Also they were understanding of my beginner needs without making me feel stupid - My neighbor recommended these guys and they didn't disappoint.

Yet another "perk" of living in this area is this awesome coffee house. It's always a challenge finding nice beans but not here.. You can tell by the wonderfully rich aroma that wafts outward as soon as you open the door. Ive had them grind for me as well as parked my bike on the patio and enjoyed a frozen concoction. Can it get better? Yes because the place is also a local establishment! Coffee enthusiast? Don't miss!

I recently moved and live really close to LGO and I'm feeling really lucky! In the last week I have had the rotisserie chicken sandwich - a stacked turkey sandwich, a croque madame (which, if you dont know what it is, just get it.) and probably the best blueberry muffin I've ever had...oh and gelato, an incredible chocolate chip cookie (sea salt!) and coffee.. I'm guessing I'll find an excuse to get there tomorrow! Also the pizza...WOW!

I have bought furniture from Copenhagen numerous times over the past ten years and have rarely been disappointed. My recent experience, of course, involves the new house. I finally got to shop for a cool sectional and of course this was my one and only serious stop. Leather, contemporary and exceptional in design and comfort. I also snagged a sweet Italian desk which I am currently sitting at. All of this aside, the reason for the 5 star review is because after delivery I came home to find a chip missing from the wood veneer. I spent the night hoping I wouldn't have to cover this area with a shelf or worse however, upon broaching the subject with our salesman he promptly agreed to exchange it for a new one. Not a small item either and there was no hesitation. I love a company that understands the consumer and takes care of them at all cost. Best part of the story? I promptly bought a rug and a matching bookshelf :)

Men's clothing also :) The jeans have always been butt flattering and there is always a fresh selection of stylish, modern clothing. When I accumulated enough points on my card for $40 buck worth of free stuff, they called me to let me know when they would expire which I thought was very nice. Trendy clothes with an attentive and friendly staff!!

Always a consistent choice for a steak and some drinks with friends. The Keg thrives on its consistency.. I sometimes wish the menu had more variety but i definitely crave it on a regular basis.

What more can be said about this classic steakhouse. I've been here many times over the past ten years and have never had a bad experience. If you like prime beef, excellent service and a great dining room experience, then you have to give this place a try. Every well rated steakhouse is worth a try, but this one is my favorite!

I'm updating a five star  review with another.. I really love this place! The service is always on par. The bar, the drinks, the patio its all very comfortable and appealing to the eye. Ruth regularly reinvents itself and the dishes always have a nice southern flair. I hope they bring the french onion soup back but the lobster mac and cheese last night more than made up for it. I've had some amazing steaks here and last nights ribeye was no different. Always perfectly cooked!  Of course the manager made sure we were in good shape and we absolutely were. There is just something about the feel of this place; for me its perfect.

Living in Arizona doesn't offer that many Chinese food options that taste good. I love Jade Palace! The food is always fresh and hot and tasty and the service has always been friendly and efficient (I've even been offered a free beer on a number of occasions because of frequent visits!) The fried rice is light and not too greasy and the sizzling beef dishes are creative and keep me coming back for more. Soups are excellent as are the ribs, eggrolls and other classics! Cute girls behind the front desk round off a very pleasant, belt loosening experience.

I have recently discovered George and Son..very nice contemporary Chinese cuisine. The classics taste great..the hot and sour soup is both original and memorable. The service has been very efficient and George is a funny presence who clearly loves his business and takes care of his customers. It's been worth the drive and I'll definitely return!

It's a subshop and so much more! I've been going here for years and it's consistently delicious and fulfilling. The service is friendly and the decor is Rastafarian/pothead paradise. It's got a nice bar selection and some really delicious cookies. If I'm in Tempe and pretending to be younger than my age, this place always come to mind!

Outstanding! - I hit Durants again last night for the new date's birthday and Its going to be hard to think of a negative thing to say. Everything from the entrance to the decor and lighting  to the incredible food and wine was perfect. Shrimp cocktail, bisque, steaks and a great dessert..there is nothing else to say.

Its three weeks later and I decided to visit Sapporo again..this time with my mother, brother his new wife and a new woman Im trying to impress..I am somewhat shocked and saddened to write that I had a similarly disappointing experience as the last time I went..our server forgot the olives in my drink..twice..and looked pretty annoyed when I had to remind her the second time..My date, who barely drinks said it tasted like bubbly lemonade, not grey goose and tonic (weak drinks again??).. We ordered three entrees and sushi - we received two entrees and sushi.. Im not really sure how my date's entree was forgotten and by the time we explained the error and they brought her meal out, my lamb chops were cold. My Mom's kung pao chicken was so salty she refused to eat it and although I though it was edible, it had a PF Chang's kind of feel..The saving grace was the outstanding sushi, as always. My out of town guests were impressed so I saved a little face. I am not a serial negative reviewer and this has been one of my favorites for years..but the last two experiences have marred a once swank, must hit in Scottsdale.

I, of course, decided to give my former favorite sushi place a try again and I am pleased to say it was a much better experience - Good service and great food again. Our cute waitress was very attentive..the music from the bar area, which I enjoy when in the bar area, was a bit much in the dining area, but I will be back..

Im a fan of Tom and suggested this place to our group of 6 but what a disappointment. The restaurant was uncomfortably cold. My beet salad had too many, esthetically pleasing, flavorless beets. My steak was not hot and my girlfriends was overcooked. (rare came out medium..) All the meat felt like it had been waiting too long to be served and the sides were also limp and only average. The service was slow and didnt have the professional touch I enjoy at other steakhouses. Maybe because we were seated at ten pm but its Vegas and at $125 per person for a table of 6 they could have treated us better! When the tip is included why does the service always suck?? We all agreed the food court would have made more sense..

I've been to this Flemings many times over the years and it's always outstanding. We reserved a table late and let them know it was my girlfriends birthday and, sure enough, best booth in the house! First of all, our server Kevin was hospitable and went above and beyond the call of duty. Typically then service here is good but tonight was excellent. Steaks.. My favorite food, and the dry aged ribeye here is bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. I started with the French onion because I've been getting in the gym recently and had minimal guilt. The lava cake was a bridge too far but it was her birthday.. Really delicious! Flemings potatoes are usually a must and the creamed corn had a nice zip to it. Always a great wine selection here and always on my list of "when are we going to.."

I've been to this location many times and Maggianos was a restaurant I frequented in my college days in Chicago. It's been consistently excellent over the years. Everything from the bread to my favorite classic chicken parm to the delicious profiteroles, is outstanding. I mixed it up today and went with the piccata and I was very pleased. I've never had any issue with service and I've sat in the bar frequently as well as the dining room. The bar area is nice and open with sports on the TV's and Sinatra playing overhead. Maggianos is always a great spot for some Italian comfort food, lunch or dinner! If you're in a group, the family style dining is a great option and totally worth it.. Huge portions and they keep coming! It is a chain, but it's a good one that has been on my list of regular spots for over a decade.

The Spotted Donkey is always good food, creative selections with a nice atmosphere and attentive service - Last night's visit was no different and the New Mexican green chilli meatloaf was a very pleasant surprise - I almost always get the Jalapeno shooters as well as the guacamole and am never disappointed. They weren't too keen on handing us the restaurant week menu which I never understand - Its a promotion of the food and brings new and regular customers to the business - take the hit, offer it to me and I will likely be back. At Flemings if you request tthe restaurant week menu, you will likely be ignored for the rest of the evening. Not so here, so I got over it. A couple of tasty margarita's helped..

A disappointing evening at the white chocolate grill. Apps were good, my salad was fresh and tasty and the bread pudding dessert was amazing. Unfortunately my balsamic ribeye came out completely raw.. I ordered it medium rare and it wasn't even close. I mentioned it to our server who agreed with me and took it away. I would have been happy if they offered me a free dessert at this point but they put the already thin piece of meat back on the grill, burnt it and brought it back out with some fresh rice and fresh balsamic drizzled on it. I assumed a new steak was coming but I paid 26 bucks for an entree that was minimally edible both times it was brought out. I was surprised because I have had good experiences here in the past, and I should know better than to order a steak in a non-steakhouse..its my fiance/professional chef who insists I complain.. I just can't imagine Ruth's or Mastro's putting a served raw steak back on the grill, burning it to a crisp and re-serving it..

I am a regular at Yard house and dont have too much to complain about - the beer is good and there is a very diverse selection - the food is also good for a bar and grill type place - unfortunately, this typically reflects in the bill. Lunch for two can easily exceed 80 bucks..If that is no big deal, the Yard house patio is a great location for lunch or dinner..

Simply put, Binkley's is a must hit in Arizona. This unique and cutting edge restaurant in Cave Creek is a hidden gem owned by an award winning chef who will take you on a culinary journey. I honestly believe you need to be ready for this kind of cuisine and its not for the faint of heart or the closed minded. If you're brave and up for the challenge, prepare your senses and let them lead you away. Words can't do Binkley's justice.

A quaint little place with very tasty, homemade Italian food. In a town where most think PF Changs is chinese food, this little bistro is a welcome change. The owner was present and so pleased we were in his restaurant that his attitude was contagious. Our servers were knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The food was clearly fresh and the favorites we had were outstanding. I even had dessert which rarely happens. A cool date place and an excellent choice for those who know that Olive Garden sucks.

A really great experience at Donovan's last night! From bread to bacon wrapped scallops, prime ribeye to Alaskan king crab, the food is a ten out of ten. It's worth mentioning that the service at Donovan's is a cut above. The staff has always added to the experience and last night was no exception.

Mostly Mediocre. Ive been going here for searing back pain for the past few years. They prescribed an MRI and its a disc problem - Unfortunately every time I go in and they recommend treatment, they tell me they will call my insurance and schedule me when they get an approval. The first time I waited two months and never got a return call. When I finally reached out, I got scheduled and had some injections. (the billing was of course, botched until I had to straighten things out). After a series of injections and some initial relief, the pain came roaring back. I went in again and the doctor recommended an ablation and we had the same conversation about how they would get in touch with me..THREE MONTHS AGO. So I call a week ago, am told to leave a message and still no return call. Clearly its time to go elsewhere. This is not a comment on the doctors..the diagnosis and treatment recommendations were appropriate. After that It's nothing but wasted time and lingering pain. If I treated people like this, I would have gone out of business years ago. It has become clear to me, that this corporate style of treatment is not for me or anybody who is looking for caring, diligent treatment and follow up.

This place is going to be tough to beat..bar service, drinks and scene - perfect, steak, stone crab, sides and coconut cream pie - perfect again. Add that to a waiter that looked like Yul Brenner, loved to talk about the place, its history and the story of the stone crab and you have restaurant greatness. I'll be back next month..

Wonderful atmosphere, stellar service and mouthwatering, five star steakhouse food make this mastros the place to hit on a Friday or Saturday night. Of course it has to be budgeted for because this place isn't cheap, however the see and be seen crowd is here. Live music in the lounge (the singer is beautiful!) maybe a little loud but the wonderful smell of clarified butter while observing the who's who and the pretenders more than make up for any shortcomings. Prepare yourself for an onslaught to your senses. Strong drinks and a server who will remember what you're having. Salads and appetizers that have been thought out, perfectly cooked and well presented. Unless you're having a seafood tower which is perfect in its decadence: both taste and presentation! Highly recommended and it comes any way you want it.  On to the steaks. I recommend skipping seafood as a main course. It's a great steakhouse so indulge or go to the chart house! I've had the porterhouse and the filet but if you like miles of flavor, tenderness and and the perfect combination of butter and seasoning, go with the ribeye.. Easily my favorite and the reason I don't save room for dessert. I've tried the desserts but my goal is to to enjoy the perfection of appetizer and meat. Everybody saves room for it except me and certainly not here! I can't wait for my next visit and now I'm thinking about my next steak.. Maybe this Friday?

If you love food, without question this is the store for you. The meat and produce department are flawlessly arranged and very clean. If you're looking for obscure veggies, fresh seafood and even dry aged prime steaks, you won't be disappointed. Typically the staff is willing to help and it's easy to get around. When I want to indulge, the craft beer selection is diverse! Esthetically appealing desserts and a fresh food bar that is always crowded..even a fresh coffee bean section where you can select and grind some very nice beans. It's unusual to get so excited about a grocery store but this's Whole Foods achieves just that.

I'm back in the gym. I had a personal trainer here last year who whipped me into shape and, after 6 months of back pain and eating, I'm ready to get back into it.. I've never liked going to the gym but the combination of great equipment and eye candy for miles make Lifetime the place I choose to sweat. They can be a bit sales oriented and there is frequent turnover of the staff however compared to the contractual nonsense a typical gym would make you deal with, I can definitely deal with it. I like the salon and really enjoy a smoothie after working out too..this place certainly has everything!

Overall i had a good experience at RoadRunner - The Shoedog diagnosed me and they had me with the slow-mo video of my feet while running. A great selection of shoes and a knowledgeable staff. They do get docked one star because the pitch is a bit too tricky for me. They don't really want you to know prices and almost force the expensive insole on you so when you hit the check out, wow! Sticker shock.. They also push the VIP membership.. Fortunately, having lived in this area for many years, I knew it was coming and I needed some new work out sneakers. I waited a day to write this review because I wanted to test the merchandise and I'm happy to report the shoes and insoles are awesome!! i won't complain too much if I feel like I got some value: clearly i did!

If the gym is a place you visit on a regular basis then you already know food is everything. I've recently discovered their salads, with a fresh piece of blackened fish and a hydrating drink with chia seeds and the amount of energy is unreal! I love the Biltmore location as a recent transplant and will continue to hit this place before a workout. Otherwise lots of great food selections and an upscale, healthy crowd which, if important to you, will keep you coming back for more.

I stopped going to Babbo about a year ago because of their consistent mistakes. Too many times I came home to food with missing ingredients or had a poor service experience. I was convinced yesterday to get some take out and for convenience sake I agreed to give them another shot. Sadly when we reached home (which is 3 minutes away) the pizza was cold and resembled cardboard. The Napa Valley salad, which is typically an excellent salad, didn't have the extra dressing we ordered. Also, I'm not sure what's going on with the signature bread. When this place first opened the food was hot, fresh and delicious and the service was consistent and pleasant. Another victim of the Cave Creek curse..

There were plenty of amenities and great restaurants nearby and good proximity to the Cosmo and the strip. I was really pleased with the overall experience and extra credit goes to the front desk staff for accommodating us with extra rooms at the last minute. I will definitely be back!

Big Earls has been in cave creek as long as I can remember. If a hangover has set in, a mushroom Swiss with bacon and the delicious Cajun fries are just what the doctor ordered. The milkshakes are decadent, the beer selection is diverse and the servers are typically cute! Perfect for a weekend lunch when visiting cave creek.

It breaks my heart that I am giving Cartwrights one star but, as my fellow Cartwrights devotees can attest to, things have changed recently for the much worse. I have been eating here for ten years. Its a special occasion place where everything is fresh and delicious.  The new, laminated menu has erased most of the great dishes and combined things in a ludicrous way. The new beet salad had a small slice of a canned beet on it and was completely inedible with some sort of awful mustard dressing. The breads were different and the famous southwest cornbread was gone. The steak came with a side of canned corn (you could taste the brine), and was nowhere near fresh and likely frozen. I wasn't going to write this review, as this happened a few months ago, but I see many have had the same experience. I am a proud ten year resident of Cave Creek. I have recommended this restaurant to friends, brought people here on several special occasions and have always referred to it as one of the best restaurants in town. This review is written in the hope that they change everything back to the way it was.

Overall a mediocre experience was had at the spa at this hotel off the strip. My friends and I tried to book massages and the attitude of the front desk staff was minimally accommodating at best. After finally arranging some appropriate times, I booked a pedicure (hey, I'm on vacation...) and the more expensive deep blue massage for 80 minutes. I was not actually told the cost of the pedicure but I did know the massage was $235. I'm not complaining about the pedicure; she was efficient and did a nice job. The massage was something one would experience at a massage envy. Clearly she had no idea what deep tissue meant; sometimes too hard, sometimes non existent following the same pattern and ending at the same place over and over and over....I get regular massages and it helps my back but this was an 80 minutes waste of time. I have had spa massages before and at least they make you feel like you are spending wisely..attention to detail, asking me about achy spots and communicating. Now if this was a massage envy I would have left feeling like I shouldn't be cheap about massages..but $235!! I had to say something and the manager, who was polite, credited me 40% off the massage. Not wanting to bitch further I took it but it wasn't even close to worth the hundred and forty something I paid. I can spot inexperience and besides not offering me water when it was mercifully over, she put my glasses on my legs after she was done so that when I sat up they hit the floor..sigh. I knew it when she slapped some deep cold crap on my back and caressed my feet for ten minutes..The time I spent in the hot tub was nice and much more relaxing.

We went next door to watch some of the World Cup and were directed here if we wanted an indoor table. Yes the game was on which earns a star. I ordered a beer and our server insisted on collecting the five bucks immediately.. We have been eating all over town this week so this was weird. Our order was so simple: poutine, pizza, souvlaki. 45 minutes later and still no food. It wasn't busy so I'm guessing one kitchen is cooking for multiple restaurants? We politely asked if food was coming and were given no hint that it was so we impolitely walked out. I hated doing it but we were starving and 40 minutes is my cut off.

I have been to Shula's in Miami and this isn't really the same thing. The service was horrible. We didn't get bread until after the oysters and we didn't get the horseradish we requested twice. My girlfriends soda was not supposed to be diet. And, although other tables around us got the meat presentation, we did not?? I was looking forward to a nice steak and it was disappointing. Dry, little flavor and warm at best. I was mocked for ordering the steak fries as a side and it turned out to be the best thing on the table..sadly it took ten minutes and multiple requests to get some ketchup.  Unless you're over 50, a fervent Nascar fan or want to play the $25 high roller tables, I would steer clear of Wild Horse Pass. Somehow it managed to bring the level of this steakhouse way down.

Ive been to this Baskin Robbins many times with the same moderately acceptable service every time. The last few times the punks behind the counter were especially loud, obnoxious and went out of their way to make us feel uncomfortable. Truly unfortunate for the owner who should know how his/her business is being tended to. After last night's ludicrous display of teenage angst, i will never set foot in that place again..

Good burger joint with fresh food and great fries - Inexpensive and has some good options for toppings (fresh Jalapenos! and I love vinegar and seasoned salt on my fries. Its a bit loud but totally worth the classic burger. Hot dogs are great as well. The real drawback is you'll gain a few pounds quickly if you eat here often but In and Out doesnt even compare..

Our waiter informed us that this restaurant was more collaboration than fusion. At first this was confusing but after many small, delicious plates emerged from the kitchen, I understood. I love Chinese and Mexican food and this place brought out some great flavors from both nations. Pot stickers, dumplings, an awesome fried rice dish and a very tender Mongolian beef were complimented by tacos, guacamole..you get the idea. The hostesses graciously seated us right away on a packed night and the view from the casino/patio was outstanding. Not outrageously expensive either like most casino restaurants so overall a great choice in the Cosmo.

I had a very pleasant buying experience at iRun. I needed some shoes for hiking and got some good info and a great pair of shoes. As always, I love buying local and appreciate good customer service. Tiffany was very knowledgeable and helped me find a perfect pair of shoes that wasn't nearly as expensive as my last pair and there was no gimmicky sales pitch or ridiculous accessories I was guilted into buying! If you're in shape and appreciate local businesses head over to iRun!

Solid late night donut place. Open all the time with some unusual drinks and a drive through. Its dangerous having a great dessert haven around the corner from my place but it certainly reaffirms my love affair with this area!

I had been anticipating Copper Blues for a few weeks. I had heard good things and I can't stay away from live music. The evening started slowly when our server told us they were out of half of the beers on tap. I'm not sure why? No big deal, I found a nice selection and ordered some food neither of which disappointed. The music was fun and entertaining.. a nice selection of modern favorites and even some 80's classics. The band had a powerful sound and the crowd got more and more dense. Its noteworthy that this crowd was a bit more eclectic and "real" than the normal Old town feel, which was what I was looking for. A good time was had; music, beer, friends and good food!

For me, Timmies is a childhood memory. It kept me up in college, fed me on my commute to high school and embodies hockey and Canada. These are some of the reasons that make Tim Horton's and a visit home perfect!

What's better than a cold beer and burger on a beautiful spring day in Az? Better service would have helped. I've had good experiences at the old town location. Here, the bartender was putting away glasses instead of paying attention to hungry and thirsty patrons. We waited 10 minutes for her to take a drink order, and waited 30 minutes for food. We ordered the egg roll appetizer and it all came together and they were cold. My Chicago hot dog wasn't bad and her mac and cheese was pretty tasty, whats with the poor service? It's so easy! Sigh. Good location and high hopes but not there yet.

Thanks to Desert Valley Audio i am finally listening to my home theater! I had an outstanding experience with this company. I needed my Dad's old and complicated stereo paired with a more modern preamp and connected in my new house. These guys didn't miss a beat. A nice modern piece of equipment was selected and within a week my house is again alive with some powerful sound. From my first introduction in the showroom, to the salesman who came to my place and made suggestions to the guys who did the connection (prompt, thorough, knowledgeable and courteous), i really couldn't be happier. I will absolutely use them again when its time to take my house to the next level in terms of video and locking mechanisms, ways to remote control the temperature etc! Thank you again, I'm listening as we speak!

A jewel of a restaurant in Cave Creek! I love good, fresh Thai food and from the wonderful smells coming from the kitchen, to the charming Owner ensuring a great dining experience, I would absolutely rate Z's as good as it gets. I of course started with the Tom Yum soup; my standard test to see what "spicy" means, and I was not disappointed. Hot, flavorful and a delicious burn, this soup, by itself, will keep me coming back. The crab fried rice and the Pad Thai were the perfect accompaniment to the Mussaman curry..a dish from the "favorites" section of the menu. The meat was layered with a rich curry flavor and the potatoes were perfect in their tenderness. Zilia explained to us that this section of the menu were all her grandmother's recipes and I will absolutely be back to try every one of them!

What a great experience at this authentic thai spot! I love spicy food so thai is a natural fit. Their menu is small but every dish was pleasing to both the eye and the palate! No doubt the spicy level is high, but it's definitely part of the authenticity. The mango and papaya salads were delicious. The pad thai and and cashew chicken were layered with flavor and the pineapple fried rice was perfectly made and served in the pineapple! Great service and freshly made creative dishes.. Montreal is becoming my favorite city!

I don't miss the accent but I do miss the hot dogs. It was great to finally get to this Chicago favorite right here in Phoenix. I remember from back in the college days that the proud Chicagoans regularly boasted about their hot dog prowess but most stadiums disappointed me...not so when I would go to Portillo's. More often than not It served as hangover relief and the lifesaving hotdogs still taste great. I had the Polish sausage and those ruffled fries. Salty with plenty of mustard and onions and the ability to take me right back to the ridiculous winters and entertaining summers, Portillo's has great food and a good amount of nostalgia!

We had a wonderful experience at the sow on a busy restaurant week Saturday. Live music was playing and some unique drinks were flowing (try the Moscow mule!). I went with the price fixed menu and enjoyed the Brussels sprouts salad as well as a very tasty and large portion of the pork belly. Outstanding! I had to try the already famous duck fat fries with the 110 minute egg and wasn't disappointed. The egg was an experience and clearly this is a dish not to be missed; especially if you like French fries. A nice dessert selection including a fresh fruit plate rounded off a very pleasant experience. Considering the PV mall location, The Salty Sow is a great find and I'll be back soon enough.

The Dominicks of central Phoenix/Biltmore.. Amazing, expensive,classy with a great scene. Another stellar steakhouse in phoenix! The seafood and the steaks were delicious, well presented and the service was absolutely on par with the feel of the place. An awesome seafood display and a convoluted, multi room feel to give you desired privacy or a bistro feel. Bring your wallet and enjoy a great meal.

I finally decided to step up and buy what I know to be a great piece of furniture, a zero gravity recliner from Relax the Back. Ive been a fan of this store for many years and this location provided some excellent service. Thoroughly knowledgeable and very accommodating, I will likely be back soon for a sweet office chair. The daily discomfort in my lower back hasn't felt this comfortable in years. The only drawback is that I can't get my girlfriend to get out if it!

Definitely a fun scene. Girls in bikinis, nice weather, great club music with better and better dj's every time. Here's my problem.. I got a cabana for a group of friends. I was told $650 minimum which wasn't a problem..the menu said a bottle of Grey Goose was $325 so I told our gorgeous server that two bottles would do it. Many drinks and dances later, long after "scottsdale delirium" had set in, I am presented with a bill for over $900 and added a gratuity making it over a grand. On the bill it said a bottle of goose was over $400.. I wasn't sure what was going on and not wanting to make a scene after a fun day, I signed and left with a bitter taste in my mouth.. It's a good club in a great area but since when is treating a repeat VIP/cabana customer like that a good idea??

I was very pleased with my experience here. First of all, any authentic, ethnic cuisine is welcome in our area. The service was caring and excellent, the food was delicious and fresh. I am always critical of rice but this also satisfied me. I will definitely return for another great meal!

A terrible experience renting a car at this location. I wanted to rent a car to get out of town for the weekend so I used credit card points and was directed to this airport location. I thought this was going to be a mistake and it surely was. I'm sure if i was getting off a plane this would have been a different experience, but I'm a local and was forced to this location. When approaching this location there isn't one sign that says "rental car pick up"; not one. Confusing to say the least, after circling a few times and a gps that was totally confused and me trying "Rental car drop off", i stopped to ask for help and was directed to "visitor parking". Seriously.  Found the parking lot, met other equally confused consumers and proceeded to lug our bags through the airport. Now the line up.. we are approached by a friendly salesman who asks us if we have an out of state license. No, in state..ok then you have to wait in line...what?? Its getting equally frustrating as this line of three people takes 45 minutes to make it through. The young lady who helped us at the desk was friendly and accommodating (plus one star). Again lug our bags through the airport and they have no idea where the car is..car to be picked up at 1 and its 2:30. Then the insurance crap.. "how would you like to insure this car?" i have my own insurance so I'm set, is met with sarcastic laughter and disbelief. I wonder if he thought It was my first rental? Now I just want to get out of here, which is easier since I circled so many times trying to get in here..but its not over yet. A nice young lady stops us and asks about our experience. Now we all sarcastically chuckle and she becomes insistent.."no tell me what happened" is met with "can I please get the hell out of here??" I have no idea why my credit card company made me book at this location when I used my points.. I will never come here again and, if you are a local, you shouldn't either.

As always, whole foods is awesome - it is a little more cramped than my previous local and the service in north scottsdale, believe it or not, seemed friendlier..regardless the meat section is enough to make me want to shop here regularly.

I've been to the Henry a few times now and haven't been disappointed in a single bite. A creative drink selection (try the gun and tonic 8) has accompanied skirt steak, short rib, sea bass, the rotisserie chicken and the popovers! All well made, perfectly prepared creative and delicious dishes shared and enjoyed by everyone who tried them. On our way out I scoped out the breakfast menu and the coffee bar and clearly I have to return. Of course the icing on the cake had been the first class service. Tonight at the bar, our bartender was really on point. Everything you would expect in a great establishment.

Made a stop after some sweet jazz in the Heineken tent during the Montreal jazz fest. Our experience was pleasant and efficient. Just a quick stop so only tried the thai basil and the red curry chicken. Both dishes were excellent lunch plates. Tasty, hot and fresh accompanied with a cold sleemans and a pleasant server and my week at the jazz fest continues to impress!

Last night was likely the last visit to this location. We ordered take out around 7 pm and i live about ten minutes away. They got off to a rough start when I ordered shrimp scampi the response was "what kind of meat?" I continued with the el diablo shrimp pasta and again was met with "what kind of meat?" Wow.. Just like last time we were quoted an hour and ten minutes before it would be ready.. Left the house around 8 and of course, upon arrival, the food wasn't ready. Our wings weren't done yet. so we waited, and waited..845 and it finally arrived and our polite server proceeded to pull the rest of our food out of the warmer. Sad that they had the pastas and bread under a heat lamp for 30 minutes while the wings were cooking?? Who is running this dog and pony show? Unfortunately this is a consistent experience and, sadly the food was, as expected, cool and mediocre by the time i got home. It was 915 and all that was enjoyable was the cold garlic bread. Yes the servers and hostesses are cute..+ one star. Im glad I had a gift card. Should have gone to "Z's"!

I've been a big fan of Jade Palace for many years. The old location was a favorite and I'm happy to say the new location boasts the same great, fresh food, the same dedicated service and the same level of caring hospitality. New York egg roll, chicken fried rice, sizzling beef and scallops are dishes I have enjoyed over the years.. I like the new upscale decor as well as the bar area. Always a convenient and delicious choice in North Scottsdale!

I had an awesome experience at this cool new fusion restaurant in Scottsdale.A group of us tried a lot from the menu including the fried rice, pad thai, sea bass pork belly..you get the idea. Every dish was served on a well presented plate and was equally delicious. Im picky about rice and their version was a nice mix of Mexican spice and Asian elegance. Every dish was cooked to perfection. The pork belly was a treat and the sea bass went really fast. If you're feeling decadent, and I often am when I'm out, try the billionaire roll. Way overpriced kobe beef roll that includes gold flake..Had to have it and it was stellar! Our server was busy but efficient and friendly. The patio was comfortable and had a nice selection of attractive Scottsdalites. Great new addition to the scene.

Definitely fun and something new. I wouldn't say its for younger children because the riddles aren't exactly straightforward. The staff is fun and really into the production and our group enjoyed the experience! If you're looking for a cool challenge and are willing to suspend your disbelief this is definitely worth checking out. Get a group that is into riddles and puzzles and it really will be entertaining!

I love discovering a new, awesome restaurant in my hometown!. The Angry Crab Shack delivered on multiple levels and I already can't wait to go back. All kinds of fresh seafood served in shells in bags with varied levels of spiciness and multiple sauce choices. Wow the king crab was incredible! The blue crab was almost as good... the oysters alone will make me come back; possibly the biggest and juiciest i've ever had. As a transplant from the east coast, this Cajun seafood paradise is a must hit! Also worth mentioning is the servers and the hostess were on their game and I felt a sense of team oriented customer service. Great food, great service, see you soon.
