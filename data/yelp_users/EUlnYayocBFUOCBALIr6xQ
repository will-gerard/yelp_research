I have never been to a Starbucks were the service was complete reckless. Employees who do not smile. Who have these long conversations with each other. Have a customer spell out their name for them and still misspell it. Forget to put water in an oat meal or put to much water. Give the wrong utensils to a customer. Tell a customer they should've asked the worker at the register if you wanted whip cream or not. And grabbed a regular that was in the back of four people, just because they already knew what they were having. It's the little things that count in this kind of business. Also Kassy if that really is her name qualifies for all the above. If you cannot handle getting up early and putting on a smile you should really change work shifts. Gorgeous set up just horrible service!
