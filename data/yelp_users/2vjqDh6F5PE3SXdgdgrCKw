I am pretty easy to please when it comes to eating in restaurants and I was definitely happy with this restaurant.  The food was good, it took a little while to come out but they were busy.  It's pretty easy to mess up a bloody mary and theirs was fantastic.  The lobster claws were a little over cooked but still pretty tasty.  The crawfish were good and spicy.  The staff was courteous and the manager came over to check on us.  Our server had forgotten something with one of our orders just as the manager came over and when it was brought to his attention he brought it out himself and apologized.  I will definitely go back and recommend it to my friends.

Aqua Fria animal clinic was great before it was sold.  When we took out cat in for dental work the vet kept her from eating and drinking for almost 24 hours.  When we took our rabbit in they seemed to have no understanding of rabbit temperament and were quite rough with her.  I will not be taking any of my animals back here.

I absolutely love this place. The delivery can take awhile sometimes but otherwise they are amazing. Order the combination fried rice or the pork egg foo young.

This is by far the best vape shop that I have ever been too. Caleb and Brice are by far the best dudes you can get your mods, atty's or juice from. They are always the best dudes even if you're just coming in to hang out or learn about a set up. I highly recommend Butt Out.

I have been to a lot of vape shop and generally try and give them the benefit of the doubt. I was willing to overlook the fact that they mix the juice right when you ask for it rather than premade in a sterile environment. When I walked in it was a little strange because every person turned toward and stared at me as I had to walk across the shop. The guy that helped me did seem knowledge and began preparing the juice I asked for. However he didn't even take the time to wash his hands before preparing the juice. It was difficult to even get help initially because it seemed the other person working there was more interested in talking with the people in the shop who were standing in the way playing video games.  I had a chance to try the juice and it honestly was not good. Very chemical tasting. I will definitely not be back to this shop and don't recommend it to anyone.  Edit: figured out what is wrong with the juice. I don't think the nic level was done correctly.
