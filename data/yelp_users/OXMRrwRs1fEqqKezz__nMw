Wasn't the worst place I've been too but it still has it's negative points.  Took a little bit for someone to recognize we were even there and than the waitress was slow.  The waitress than left and went home with out letting us know so that just seems weird to me.  35$ for two meals and two beers seems pretty steep.  Oh and the bathroom were mote than unpleasant with the graffiti and the paint falling apart.  The food was pretty good but not for the price I paid. All in all I'll just say cleanliness goes a long way.

Always a good time in here.  Gamestop is what Gamestop is but the people here make it why I come were.  Come in and ask for Sarah.  She'll take care of you and always greets you with a smile.

I've never had a bad night here and I always enjoy watching the sports I love! The wings are good but they are small in my opinion but you can't beat the Burgers here ! Especially when they are half priced on the weekends ! Happy Hour is always good here and so is the atmosphere . I always take friends here when they need to get out and relax for a bit .

Breakfast is great here!  Not a huge lunch menu,  but I imagine it's great too.  Dog friendly patio and very accessible.  Service is friendly with different selections of drinks and coffee bar.  I try and come here with people from out of town.
