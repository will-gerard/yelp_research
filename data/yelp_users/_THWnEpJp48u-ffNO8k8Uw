man i love this joint.   the food is amazing and the ambiance very romantic. or in my case BRO-mantic as i come here annually with my high school bud. we had a blast with 6 dudes at the table. we were very loud, but it's spacious enough that it won't matter. plus it's vegas baby. don't get me wrong this is a classy joint, very upscale, but i love how we can come in here decked out in our now infamous vegas costumes complete with leisure suits and bandanas and no one blinks an eye.  do get: the BEEF WELLINGTON. my favorite thing on the menu. careful tho... if you get it too "rare" the pastry crust doesn't cook all the way through.  salad: this place makes your salad for you at your table and it's divine. my personal preference is to NOT mix in every salad ingredient as it will turn your salad into a funk salad. IXNAY on the hearts of palm (it overpowers all the other flavors). keep it simple, less is more. LOVE the  baby shrimp on the salad - goes well with cream dressing, egg and bacon.

this place is awful...  out of the 4 chefs, NONE of them were THAI.... strangely enough all the waitresses were Thai???  had the spicy thai eggplant and papaya salad..  thai papaya salad is supposed to be very tart with a strong taste of lime..i think they forgot this key ingredient... not even a hint of lime flavor although the green papaya was chopped nicely.  thai eggplant was ridonkulously BAD.  i had 3 measly pieces of eggplant in my dish.  the rest was overcooked meat and overcooked veggies.  overcooked broccoli is the worst... kind of loses it's nice green color and firm texture.  the sauce for the thai eggplant wasn't quite right either, and reminded me of the entree "beef broccoli" from a Chinese restaurant.  again, this place was BAD.... phuck phoenix, dude. i'm over it.
