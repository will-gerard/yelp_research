Nice place in the middle of a residential area making it a quaint local spot. Really enjoyed the Pacifico on tap ($4.25/glass) and the Nachos gustivo pequeno ($9.00 for small). A bit pricey but still a fun place.

First visit was not that impressive.  Service was great, place was nearly full but the flavor profiles were way off with limp texture.    The Tom Yam Goong soup was extremely sweet, not so sour and lacking spice but had a generous portion of shrimp and mushrooms.  The pineapple curry was made with canned pineapple that was excessively sweet and limp.  The Pad Kee Mao had vegetables that were limp from overcooking. We had water for drinks so these three items totalled the bill to $39.00, tip additional.    Every restaurant has feature dishes, we must have chosen some of the wrong items.

Been parking here at least 10 times; fast, affordable and safe.  Use your smartphone and YELP app to access the super check-in discount.  While it didn't happen this time, at Christmas they were especially full, so don't be surprised at that time of year and make reservations (yes, make reservations at a parking lot)

Food was expensive, but very good.  This would have been an easy 4+ rating but I repeatedly got jabbed in the back by a food server's tray three times so I'm steamed and have downgraded this to two stars.  After reading Yelp'ers reviews and talking to my co-workers who were very positive about Stockyards Restaurant, I really had a desire to go.  Thanks to Erica's Yelp review she turned me onto the happy hour and recommended seating at the bar.  I found it easy to find two center bar seats at 5PM on a Friday night.  Bartender Tom was great; touted the Happy Hour prices, made sure I knew about the Happy Hour snacks and whipped up a mean 'tini ($8).   The Happy Hour sliders were made from a very good grade of Beef.  When it came time for dinner, I stayed at the Bar and had a great meal of The Cattle Baron's 18oz Prime Rib ($36).  Tom also recommended a great Cab by the glass ($5) to go with it.  Prime Rib was done exactly how I like it, medium rare, and well seasoned with salt/pepper.  Along with the meal, starters included a nice Caesar Salad, veggies and bread. I left an 18% tip.  The problem which reduced this experience to two stars was that I stayed at the Bar to eat.  There were two other food servers in the bar; a lady and a man.  The lady blazed through customers walking to the bathroom with complete disregard, pushing us out of the way.  The male server came to deposit his tables' empties at center of the bar right where we sat, so that we had to stare at dirty glassware.  Each time he did so, he leaned between us and rammed his tray into my back.  I leaned as far forward over the bar that I could but each of the three times he still jabbed his tray in my back.  We were so upset that we abandoned the coupon's for free dessert that we got when signing up on their website.  This should never happen at any high end restaurant.    I look forward to returning, having another great meal but being seated in the dining area so I can upgrade this rating. See photos I've attached.

On Tuesday Feb 1, 2011 Gary Lasko responded to my Yelp complaint, apologizing for the service, stating the actions he has taken to train the staff in resolving my service issue, then invited me back.  Upgrade to 4 Stars for the diligence, concern and fast response. Besides, the food was excellent, portions were generous, and the sides were great..

Just under $9.00 for a combo #2 Pork Burrito, rice & beans with a medium Melon drink.  The Burrito was dry, meat greasy, beans runny and only a few spoonfulls of pico de gallo in the condiment tray.  No Salsa verde or any red sauce at all.  Staff was surly and made me feel like I bothered them to eat there.  Why didn't I read the Yelp reviews before stopping in ...

Yay! I'm a fan. Small, family place with great happy hours deals on pizza and beer.  Service is fast and I tried a mushroom slice and the wings, ordered them hot.  The girl serving beer was on me every time I needed a cool off drink from the heat of the wings.  I was completely full and she offered me a free slice, stating they had made an extra by mistake.  I was full but really appreciated the offer. Thank you

Fast seating, polite staff, quick service + attention, great salads.  I also ordered the pizza for us to share and they brought it to me.  While it seemed to be a nice size, they said it was the wrong one (too small) so was free but would bring me a correct one right away.  I would never have known. Thanks for the honesty, tipped 25%

This is Dominos Pizza store 7576 - they got our order wrong.  I was viewing a friend's FaceBook page and saw he was impressed at their new Pizza tracker online display of the progress of your take out or delivery order.  Looked pretty cool and recalled that we hadn't had a Domino's Pizza in a long time.  We ordered carryout and paid online; two Large Brooklyn style 14" pizzas with Salami, Onions & Tomatos.  Total price was $20.10 and we watched the tracker progress through each stage.  As it finished I drove there to pick it up.  When I got home and we each had a piece, we saw that we received a sliced Italian sausage pizza not Salami and the tomatos or onions were rare.  (See photos).  It was very windy so I had rushed home in the darkness without checking the order (Note to self - never trust again).  The tracker was cool, very innovative and informative, telling who was doing what at each step.  It has one step called "QUALITY CHECK" and it showed that Bambi had completed this.  Looks like this one slipped through as I got sliced Italian Sausage not Salami.  All this for two 14" pizza costing $20.10?   I may have found out why I hadn't ordered a Domino's pizza in a while ...

I had complained about an incorrect order and Dominos stepped up and turned this one around.  Unbelievably great commitment to customer satisfaction that is much appreciated.  It also reminded me of the nice garlic flavor they have on the edge of each pizza crust, that is tasty and I haven't found elsewhere.    Thank you

From the waiting area they announced the plane would have NO WATER ON BOARD for a 2 hour flight.  Nothing potable (drinkable), yet the ship steward announced it as "no portaable water" until fellow crewman corrected that...ahem!  They saved a bit of money bu purchaisng older planes?

A little bit difficult to find and an off beat menu pairing but it was good. (Note:  despite the Yelp map showing it on the E side of Central, Lo-Lo's is actually West of Central two doors on the North side of Yuma).  The sign is small so keep your eyes open.  Walk in and the waiting area has several nice pieces of art displayed as well as a book section where you can enjoy a quick read in kind of a coffee house atmosphere.  If you have time.  The guy and the girl who were working staff were quick, polite, helpful and cheery.  We were seated right away.  Service was prompt and lightening fast, but I went before the noon rush with only 4 other parties when we arrived and 3 more that came along after us.  So I imagine it changes, YMMV  I had the Lil' Amadi combo opting for two thighs and a waffle plus a large Sweet Tea.  Chicken was great, flavorful and juicy but not too salty and the waffles crispy and tasty - cooked just right.  The Massive Kern mason jar of sweet tea was never empty thanks to prompt staff workers.   Total of mine came in at $10.38, then I tipped 20%.  Fair fare price - LOL!   Photos attached   YELPERS: This Place is another one of the gems I might never have found without browsing the selections on Yelp.    Thanx Yelp for keeping it fresh.

Great food, fast service and nice salsa bar.  Walking in my first impression of the brightly lit place with hard chairs was definitely fast food.  That is what this place is.  I ordered the chicken Tostada for $3.99 and a medium soda, total $6.27.  Noticed a big selection of salsa and my order quickly came.  The tostada seemed expensive but when I started digging in it was packed with chicken.  Well worth it. Their salsa bar was great to add flavors and heat. I'm a fan and will be back

After finding it on Yelp and reading the reviews I decided to try it.  Its a small, local place located on the West side of the Fry's shopping center.  Its around on the side that faces 35th so its a bit remote to find.   I had to make an effort to locate it but glad I did.  Lots of local customers, many appear Italian and it is a simple place that is very comfortable.  I really liked the crust, slightly thin, crispy on the bottom a bit soft on the top.  I had two slices of Pepperoni and a 20oz soda, total with tax under $5.  Some excessive oil, probably from the pepperoni so I think next time I'll try something different like veggies, perhaps mushrooms or olives

Saw the crowds as I drove by and stopped in.  Fantastic prices on Mexican grown produce, reasonably good selection, but many of the items such as peppers and berries had already started to turn.  The shopping experience brings this down from a 3-4 star review to a one star; be prepared to get pushed, shoved and elbow checked by the professional shopping senior ladies who will run you down roller derby style under full court press.  The check out counter is fast as those guys can sense the desparation of the crowd.  Not for the faint of heart but definitely some great values and I did survive.  Open til 7PM and I wonder if those elbowed ladies retreat before then

My first time at this location.  I had the lunch special; small Ham and Cheese, chips and soda for $6.00.  I chose the Jalapeno cheese bread because I enjoy a bit of heat and the order was quickly prepared.  The bread, meat and cheese had been heated and that really made this sandwich tasty.  There were veggies and not too much mayo or mustard, just enough for an accent to the taste.  I really enjoyed it and noticed this place was popular with the lunch crowd...for good reason.  The help was vey informative when I hesitated choosing a sandwich, answered several questions showing they knew their item.  For the great value pricing, heated sandwich, and quick preparation I go against the other Yelper's votes and recommend it for a fast lunch.  Its not gourmet by any means but it doesn't pretend to be.

A nice budget motel.  Got a AAA deal for $59 + tax and it was most everything I expected; clean, quiet and comfortable.  If your wife requires five star rooms, marble floors, etc then this isn't that but is more like mid level.  It suited my needs, the pool was clean, and the grounds are nice.  Had a little difficulty with sleeping - the pillows were way thick and the bed a little hard, bringing this down to net of two stars

We dropped in after a movie at Tempe Marketplace at the insistence of Dave who had been here as a local.  They were just about closed and it was 100 degrees out but they still let us in.  Service was exceptional, waters filled every minute they were emptied.    I asked and got a great recommendation on the $9 Calzone and it was absolutely fantastic and came quickly.  Ricotta cheese, onions, 3 types of peppers and that thin, wonderful crunchy crust.  I hadn't a Calzone this phenomenal in years.  The crust was light and tasty and they included Au Jus which was a different but nice touch  I did taste the pizza the guys ordered and I understand some of the Yelp comments about the tomato sauce being too sweet.  I still enjoyed the pizza but if you don't care for sweet spicey tomato sauce I would highly recommend the Calzone

Great food, wonderful flavors and the perfect place to splurge on a special date for two.  Pricey but worth it.  I saw Wayne's tip about the coupon at http://www.restaurant.com/le-sans-souci-french-restaurant-cave-creek-french-pid=36877 and bought one too.  Seated nearly immediately in a restaurant that was just over half full. We heeded fellow Yelpers' advice and got Escargo, Ceasar salad, brochette and duck l'orange for our dinner selection.  Portions were on par or larger with great flavors that were wonderful.  Ms. D is a Francophile and was very impressed which made me happy.  Dessert was Creme Brulee for her and Chocolate Mousse for I with great coffee.  Desserts were far too big for us as was the after dinner drink.  My Grand Marnier must have been a double!  Excellent food, proper service and a great selection lends this an easy 5 star review

Rachel's review was right, exceptionally friendly staff, great service, and my glass was never empty.  20% tip was justified and paid.  Where the discrepancy starts is with the chicken.    I had stopped in at the souvenir store across the way and had asked if the food at The Horny Toad was good, then gotten the "Yes!, people come for their chicken & ribs" so decided to try it.  Asked the friendly food server what she recommended and revealed it was my first time...Chicken was the answer with a full justification as it was pressure cooked like a fryer and came with Cole slaw and fries.  I had been focused on the Reuben but thought that two local recommendations should be enough to convince me, so ordered the half chicken.    Again, service was fast, sitting on the patio was relaxing, and had a very pleasant atmosphere.  But when it arrived, the chicken was really greasy...I guess that pressure cookery was an oil bath too.  Nor much flavor and the breast meat was dry.  No hint of garlic, no touch of lemon, no light chili flavors, just bland dry chicken in oil.  Thank goodness they included a moist towlette to wipe the oil off your hands.  The bill for the half chicken and a soda with 20% tip was $18.66, a bit pricey lunch to say the least.  The Reuben sandwich lunch was half that.  I'm convinced that I made a wrong choice, should have trusted my instincts and gone with the Reuben, so I'll look forward to the next visit.

This would have been an easy 4+ star review except for the bar/food server's actions seating people in our seats near the end of the meal while we were in the bathroom.  Saw them on AZ PBS TV show "Check Please" (http://www.azpbs.org/checkplease/segments/restaurant.php?id=3206), looked good so thought we would try it.  Arrived during a busy time at 5:30PM and was told it was over a half an hour wait in the restaurant but the bar was open.  Sat in the bar at the counter and we noticed that several other folks were eating at the Bar so she decided we should do the same.    The Latino gentleman behind the bar was quick, attentive, organized, fun, and engaging.  Margaritas with Tortilla chips & Salsa came quickly and we were being taken care of well.  We both ordered the Green Chili Chimichanga and mine arrived slightly over toasted but still tasty.   Guacamole was very good.  Near the end of our meal we got up to use the bathroom and I returned first to find that the bar tender had given up our seats, even though our sunglasses, keys and her personal things were still on the bar.   Would 5 minutes have killed him to let us finish or order dessert?  Total was $43 including tip.  I had to pay from the food server's walk up area as there was no counter space elsewhere and our seats had been taken over. I've never been thrown out of a bar before, but this sure was a rude ending to an otherwise great meal.

First time here and enjoyed it very much.  I asked for a recommendation and the Adovado (red chili marinade) was the quick response.  Tasty and spicy, hit the spot and the home made salsas were a big hit with me too.  At first glance the prices seem just a tad high but the quality and time it takes to produce high quality shines through

What a wonderful dining experience. Service was great, drinks were fast, the food was very flavorful with a nice presentation.  Price was higher than a typical dining experience, but warranted.  My first time going and it was a group from the Ferrari club that organized it.  Sometimes group sizes can be challenging, not so here.  Parking out front was reserved and seating was promptly ready at 6:00PM.  We were seated in the private glass windowed Teppan Room up front and we were quickly greeted and offered cocktails.  The happy hour menu was presented and our waiter, Andrew, kept us filled and reminded us when the discounts were about to end.    I wavered on my first selection and asked the him for a drink recommendation.  He responded with a few and the sage and cucumber martini caught my eye which was happy hour priced.  I mated it with two sushi starters, the Sapporo Roll and Rainbow roll.  The martini was refreshing with a light herbal overtone and the two house rolls were exceptional.  Our group of four on the North side of the room also received an extra Salmon sushi roll at no charge.  Light orange in color with a very mild flavor, it was a gracious gift.  As we approached dinner the staff added two more gifts to our group, large communal bowls of mai-tai-like drink with a flaming lime slice floating in the middle.  It made for a very fun group social activity (see photos!).  Jan had pointed out the Filet Mignon and scallops at $20 so we decided to have those.  Our prep chef had a nice salad presentation of salad with ginger sesame dressing.    Our chefs entered our Teppan room and the action started, jokes were flying as well as food!   First off was the fried rice.  Our chef expertly rolled an egg on his metal spatulas' edges, flung it in the air several times and only after 5 mins of acrobatics, just when we started to doubt it was fragile, he allowed it to crack and start the cooking of the fried rice.  As we all clapped he flung another egg directly at Carol next to me, only to find out it had been hollowed out.  The group roared in laughter from her sartled response!    Our plates lined the Teppan counter and I never saw him dribble each one with a flammable, but the next thing we knew there was a wall of fire on our plates as he cooked the stir fried vegetables.  Main course was next and the scallops and fillet were expertly done.  Complimentary Lychee sorbet finished off the evening.

5 stars for the variety and well kept trails.  I recall a previous time when this was called "Squaw Peak" but the new name commemorates the "first nation" female soldier lost in the Iraq war.  Most visitors think about he 1.2 mile hike to the top of the summit.  While that is a good hike for those with limited time and it is also a great workout, there is much more to be seen in the park.  Much more.  Once you've done the peak and are looking for more variety and fewer people, explore the rest of this vast park.  I suggest you drive to the very North end of the road where it dead ends.  Park there and head North along one of two routes, enjoy a nice loop trek West with a big choice of routes and distances.    I think the nature trail stops with plant identification are great to help folks understand what they're around.  Piestewa Trails wander through a landscape of ocotillos, saguaros, barrel cactus and palo verde trees.   Don't forget to bring water.

Searching yelp for Thai, I found TOT. Walked in and noticed a lot of Asian Indian groups, usually a sign of good Thai food at especially low prices.  I ordered a bowl of Tom Yum Goong ($4.95) and Phat Grapao with rice ($8.95) - I selected spicey for both.  Tasty soup, lots of big shrimp, lemon grass, galanga and mushrooms.  The grapao came quickly and I hadn't had time to finish the very warm soup so I set it off to the side.  The jasmine rice had a hint of light sweetness (normal) and made a nice contrast to the veggies and chicken in the grapao.  I enjoyed the meal and service was fast, prompt and polite - would definitely go back.

I'm a fan. I stopped for some fun gazing at the weekend farmer's market and decided to stay for lunch.  Had a great burger, half pound for $8.45, friendly staff was busy with lunch time crowd but still kept my soda full.  Nice Old West atmosphere.  The table next to me ordered the wings and I could smell them as the server brought them past me.  I'm normally not a fan, but these were exceptionally great smelling and my hound dog nose was aroused.  I asked the orderers and they confirmed they are the best on the valley. BTW, despite the name, they unfortunately no longer sell steaks for lunch or dinner (I asked).

Great pIace for a short hike, wide trail, while strolling by many people.  It is amazing that you can gain some altitude and the view from the top is spectacular.  I like to go the smaller parking lot on the North side - go S. from Thunderbird onto Central and take it until it end.

Great Italian restuarant, upscale location, nicely appointed, helpful service and wonderful menu.  Pricier but not unexpected for such a nice place.  Staff was gracious and kind, excellent recommendations (house balsamic salad dressing!) and the pasta special was wonderful.  Spacious parking, great view of the park and Fountain.    Although the restaurant was filled it was not too noisey or loud to carry on a conversation.  Really enjoyed our experience there last night.  NOTE: I submitted an update to Yelp business, they have the address listed incorrectly.  It should be: 13014 N. Saguaro Blvd Fountain Hills, AZ 85268

Searched Yelp for a Taco Tuesday and found Christina's.  $1.25 for a taco and very tasty.  Ordered 4 shredded beef tacos and a soda for $6.50.  Absolutely great red salsa, the green was heavy garlic but the red hit all the right buttons.  Chips brought out as a first made this place a step above a hole in the wall at great value.  I'll be back

Several co-workers recommended Cafe Rio and we had to try it.  We arrived at 6:15pm on a Tuesday and it was a zoo.  3 kids collided with us before we even got in line and the sound level from screaming children was deafening.  We ordered in the swarming, rushed line of patrons where a burrito and drink cost $13 served in a foil tin on a tray that was soaking hot wet straight out of the dishwasher.  Clean tables were nowhere to be found and we bussed one ourselves to make a space to sit.  Food was tasty and spiced well, beans not overcooked but OMG what a horrid dining experience.  Taco Bell is more civilized and a cleaner place than this. Never again, there are plenty of places that are Mexican restaurants charging the same but are not disguised as day care centers.  Never again!

First heard about about St. Francis on local TV show "Arizona PBS ei8ht" http://www.desertsmokebbq.com/blog/tag/st-francis-restaurant/ and wanted to try it for a new date.    Parking is tight, forget the local street possibilities or the strip mall across the street and resign yourself to their valet.  Ms. D was late in arriving but we still got into their Happy Hour -(thank you Yelp'ers, this was a great tip).  I was early and at my asking The Hostess had saved us the one available outdoor seat which I knew she would want, so they accomodate special requests with ease.  We were cheerfully greeted by server Lonnie who was on top of it and got us exactly what we wanted in two flights of food and twin drink orders for a fantastic value in record time before the happy hour clock struck end.    I had been before and sought out their Grapefruit 'tinis but they weren't available, so Lonnie recommended the Ruby Reds which we selected and found to be quite good too.  The interior has a wonderful atmosphere, not too loud, pleasantly decorated and be sure to notice the architecture cable ceiled which add a modern tone to the place.  The goat cheese was wonderful, pork verde delicious and Ms. D said her onion burger was fantastic.  Total was just under $45, added 20% tip so it hit the value mark well in the bullseye.  We were never pushed, politely attended too and had the perfect scenario to focus on our conversation. Wonderful for a first date, casual business meeting or possibly even an anniversary.  I don't hand out Five Stars easily but when I want to impress picky foodie Ms. D and then it all goes well, I pull out the props.  Service, food quality, variety, selection, portions, drinks, and value were all spot on.  This is not the first time I've been to St. Francis and it has been consistent so I'm calling out the rare 5 star award based on dependability and repeated service.   Thank you

Great deals on food, wonderful deli and even their gas prices beat Costco (U-10 GIANT scallops for $9.99/lb, Costco has smaller U-15 for $12.99/lb).    So long Costco, I'm dropping my card because Fry's is so competitive without the Costco membership fee.

3 Stars is A-OK in Yelps definition, but I'm feeling this should move closer to Yelp's 4 stars = "Yay! I'm a fan".    Tasty Mexican fast food at reasonable prices is what I've experienced.  Friday was $1 off Fish items and I had the Fish burrito.  Crispy fish, well portioned wrapped in a flavorful tortilla filled with cabbage and pico de gallo.  Add a soda and total was $5.33.   Service was fast, green salsa at the Salsa bar had just the right amount of heat and flavor (I really like Salsa Verde).   I'd say they are doing it right.

Great mid priced, local Mom & Pop italian diner.  I had the $1 slice and $1 off beer on happy hour and it was great.  Affordable for families but loaded with good selections.  I loof forward to returning and trying the pastas - Bob J.'s review of the Gnocchi with spinach and bacon really caught my eye.  Didn't see it on the menu though.

Not the best, not the worst (that's USAir), but I definitely see they're allowing many free upgrades.  I'm a Premier member and fly regularly - haven't had the advertized free upgrade in 12 flights.    Rates nearly doubled too.  Got burned when booking on UNITED's website that had a "STAR Alliance Partner" flight from USAir.  I arrived only to be charged $25 per check-in bag (Premier members are supposed to be free) and not upgraded to Economy Plus.  Thanks UNITED, I'm not feeling your love of my loyalty...

Heard they recently moved to a new location but this was my first time.  We had  a fantastic pizza from the brick oven as a group starter, Turkey club for me, reasonable prices and exceptional service.  It was a 99 degree day and one of the guys in our big party told the food server from the very first, to keep bringing him sodas as he was absolutely parched.  He was a bit over the top on his request (borderline rude) but the server kept pace with it all and his drink was never empty.  Besides the group pizza as a starter I had the Turkey club Sandwich and side for $8.00 which was wonderful, I chose the fries which I normally don't let myself have and they were tasty.  The turkey club sandwich had the right amount of crunch

First time here, Thanks to Yelp.  TT-II is a small place that was slightly difficult to find, but when I arrived it was packed with folks.  I was immediately greeted by the cheery counter worker and handed a menu.  As I looked over the selections, I stumbled on the reason why it was packed - Monday's special side order was the black eyed pea cole slaw.  The propreitor told me later that a church group regularly visits for a late lunch on Mondays and that I stumbled in the middle of their lunch time.  As I gazed around, I also noticed they sell their own sauces behind the counter.  The menu had a nice variety of BBQ; both pork and beef, but also other things like catfish and vegetarian choices.  I chose half a slab of pork ribs as thinking that going mainstream in a BBQ place would give me the best feel for the place.  Each meal comes with two sides and I picked the Black eyed pea cole slaw (special of the day) and a the Creole potato salad (aka mustard) and backed it with a sweet Green Tea.  I went outside as the only available seating was there under the trellace.  It was a beautiful, warm day and I enjoyed it.  The meal came quickly and I violated any rule of balance; the ribs went into focus and then out.  Slurp.  Yum.  I poked at the black eyed pea cole slaw and descended into them.  Remarkable hint of cilantro, then accents of chopped red onion popped in, followed by a light vinegar flavor.  There was something red and finely flaked rolling around that I couldn't identify, but I'll guess pimento.  Nothing overpowering but mighty tasty. The Creole potato salad was good, standard fare but I was getting full.

Our group from work went here and had a great time.  Its a nice bar centered place with a nice variety in the menu.  Not too pricey, free peanuts that go on the floor and enough selection from red meat to vegetarian and dieters in our group.

We entered yesterday and had reubens, fries and soda.  Tasty, priced right and left me thinking about how much I wanted to return for another reuben again.  I see a lot of reviews about butterburgers and things I didn't try, unfortunately all I can comment is the Reuben that I had on my first visit (ever) and it was great.

Extensive trails, manicured walkways, over 20 species identification signs and the lookout with sighting distances to far away peaks.  This is more akin to a well groomed city park than a mountain hike.  Not very tough but there is a lot to keep your interest.  Don't miss it but don't go on a crowded weekend either.

Several of us from work stopped in because my co-workers really recommended it.  Several of them have Dickey's big, yellow cups at their work desks so I know my co-workers like Dickey's.  Unfortunately Dickey's computer systems were down so were not serving any customers.  I understand it must be devastating to a business not to be able to serve customers but we are taking time out of our work day to patronize their establishment.

Went for dinner last night and really enjoyed the rib meal.  Staff was very polite and nice.  The Pork ribs were great, I found that by "blending" their 3 sauces that I ended up with flavors I really liked (sweet with heat) and the sides were nice.  Green beans/bacon reminded me of those my Grandmother made - nostalgic moment here.  Potato Casserole was probably a serious calorie coma inducer but then again I WAS at a BBQ restaurant.  I ordered just water and they gave me a Dickey's cup.  $12 before tip, looking forward to returning

4 stars is a respectable rating and Polibertos Bell Rd serves respectable meals.  Great taste (love their salsa verde) and large portions.  Good stuff, exactly what it seems to be, fast Mex food.  Been there several times and I'll be back many more.

Had the steak burrito and it rocked!  They had three kinds of salsa, pico d'Gallo and corn salsa that melded together perfectly, added some heat but still let the flavor of the rice, beans, meat, & tortilla through.

This gem is a great piece of wide open space for North Valley residents or visitors alike. Trails are well marked, the routes are not especially difficult, and there are several points and lookouts in addition to the mainstream summit.    I like to park at the traffic circle edge on the West side of the Park, where Eastbound Coral Gable dead ends & turns South on 12th.  There are no Gates to lock your car in and the homes make it a safe area.

I've been doing well by visiting Yelp reviewed places so that is how I found Takeda Thai.  A little difficult to find as it is set back quite a ways from the SE corner of Shea & Scottsdale.  I entered for lunch and two white guys were working the tables.  Nice interior, food was tasty and fast, but seriously small portions.  Then again the lunch special only costs $7.95 which gets you a main and a soup.  I had the spicey noodles (Phad kee mow) with chicken at 3 stars (out of 4 possible).  It was tasty and I enjoyed it, seemed slightly reserved on heat but they probably didn't want to offend anyone and I still enjoyed it very much.  Where the rip is on the drinks as they charged $2.95 for a soft drink.  Add 20% for tip and it pushed it to over $14.   That's just not good value and it hit me wrong.

The salsa, meal, service, price, and beer selectIon were worth 5 stars to me.  While the dirt parking lot and the dining area interior bring it down a little, I'd say not that much considering its a casual Mexican restaurant, so I'd really rate it 4.5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow ratings with half stars.  Bottom line, I'd look forward to going again and I definitely would recommend it to friends.  Arrived and was immediately seated.  It was 7PM on a Saturday night and the place was full except for only two tables being left.  Looking around I saw lots of families were there and I counted 4 food servers.  The place looks like an older, private residence that had two separate additions to it for the dining room and then the bar.  Very casual and a comfortable, jeans type place.  There is a large outside area and since it was late November (60 degrees, brrrrr! LOL) a fire in the pit was burning.    Chips and Salsa promptly arrived from one server and as I noticed the green (Salsa Verde is my favorite!) another food server had a menu and asked about my bar order.  Mexican Beer arrived quickly with lime on the top  - Darn fast service.    The green salsa is outstanding and the red is not far behind, but I knew better than to fill up before my meal.  Mating it with beer counters that, LOL!   I had read Yelp beforehand, so had seen both Mark and Julie's reviews on the Pollo Fundido (price $12) and ordered the same.  The food server complimented the choice as one of his favorites so my expectations were high.   Rightly so, as it turns out.  Shortly thereafter the hot plate arrived with a nice soft, smooth fundido topped with its cheesey cream.  As my fork dived through, I found large, flavorful chunks of chicken inside.  The main was garnished with shredded lettuce on the far side, rice on the left and beans on the right.  The green salsa had no chance of remaining and I mixed the rice & beans together then poured the salsa verde over it. When I finished and asked the check came quickly and concluded a very nice, casual dining experience.

Ever heard the saying "Jack of all trades, master of none".   Its a donut shop, its a deli, its a cafe, its a family restaurant, its an Asian fast food place...well, we found out differently  We were looking for something different for lunch so turned to Yelp and decided to try the "Ninja Bowl".  Then found there is no place with this name.  No street sign, no door marker legend, no mailbox.  Nothing.  We had to do some hunting and asking (I hate asking) and found out the truth.  There are four names on Yelp for the same address and same location: 1) Ninja Bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz/ninja-bowl-phoenix aka 2) Rainbow Donuts Bakery & Cafe http://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-bakery-and-cafe-phoenix aka 3) Rainbow Donuts & Deli http://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-and-deli-phoenix aka 4) Bobby C's Cafe http://www.yelp.com/biz/bobby-cs-cafe-phoenix  All the same address, phone number and location.  I charged it on my Credit Card and it showed up on my bill as Bobby C's Cafe.  Had a terrible time finding it and while I only tried the Sizzling bowl the cost of $8.90 for rice, finely chopped chicken and gluten spicey sauce plus small soda doesn't warrant another visit.

Well thought out flavor profiles, even the smallest items have attention to details.  I'd go back again and enjoyed my first experience.  I was enjoying a day of meandering around Cave Creek and was getting hungry for lunch.  Walked past Bryan's and caught a wiff of their wonderful smokehouse smell.  It built on me and a block past I turned around and decided to try it.  Saw several local office folk going in so I followed them. The pulled pork sandwich was excpetional, great texture and flavor to the meat.   While I waited for my lunch I tried the two types of sauces from the condiments dispensers; normal and hot.  Alone, the sauce flavors seemed to lean too far towards tomato-ey for what I imagined BBQ sauce should be.  But when my meal came the flavor spectrum melded with the pork wonderfully.  Lesson learned:  Don't judge the BBQ sauce flavors alone, they gotta hit the meat.  My side was the potato salad, which I'd normally not think much of.  The Chef had used Baked Potato chunks which added a nice base flavor, then mixed them in with a thick, creamy dill sauce.  The baked tones complimented the herb and cream flavors so very well.  OMG it was tasty, I ended up finger licking that stuff out of the ramikan.  On the negative side, they serve lunch sandwiches in a basket lined with lightweight paper.  If any sauce gets on the paper it starts to get weak and can end up in your food.  Not  aproblem if you're a clean and neat BBQ consumer, but who is?  At one point I pulled a little bit of paper out of my mouth that had attached itself to my wet sandwich.  yuk. Also, my bill showed that Cave Creek is hitting folks up with 10.27% sales tax.  Yowza, that hurts but it can't be helped.

I'm not even hungry and I gravitate towards this place.  Heck, I'm not even a potato salad type person and I stop in just for a side of their Potato Salad.  The baking gives the potatos just the right base flavor and the creamy dill sauce gives it just the right accent. Yum! Now if I was only hungry enough for a full meal - LOL!

I had been by here several times on lunch hour, but parking was typically difficult.  On this occasion a car  had just departed and I found a spot, so in I went.  The order counter had their specials up front and center - Nice, makes it easy on us first - timers.  I ordered the lunch special; chicken sandwich, salad or fries (salad for me) and 24 oz soda.  Total price with tax was $8.77.  The salad was great, lots of variety and when I had chosen teh bleu cheese dressing the lady at the food order counter asked me if I wanted crumbled bleu on it.  Yes Please!  She didn't skimp and this was one great salad.  The chicken sandwich had a spicey rub on it which was just the right touch to balance the salad. Priced well, quick service, lots on knick-knacks onthe walls.

Recently moved 100 ft, right around the corner.  If you're having trouble locating it, its in town hall, footsteps from the Post Office.  I went for one of their Friday tastings and it was great.  Found a nice bottle of Tim Mondavi's Continuum and a substantial discount (normally much more expensive).  They also have other rarities like Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Nice!

Went with a group from work.  Ordered the special - beef and sausage and soda.  For $10.03 that is all I got, sliced beef, sausage bun and soda.  Apparently you have ask for anything else like peppers or onions.  Sure with the food server would have mentioned it.  Food was hot, but gosh it was plain.

Tasty enchiladas, great salsa and flavorful beans but it ended up being a bit pricey for Mex fast food.  I ordered the 2 enchilada combo plate listed at $5.85, then added a soft drink and the bill ended up costing $9.50.    Looking at the receipt I see they charged $1.00 extra for having chicken - didn't see that listed on the menu and the cashier didn't tell me about it which was a bit of a surprise.

I hadn't been here in a while so thought I'd try them again, this time for breakfast at 8:30AM on a Saturday.  Ordered the Mexican breakfast and it was listed as coming with rice & beans on the drive through sign but I never received them.  Have you ever been burned at a drive through, only to find out the dissappointment when you open the bag and are too far down the road to turn around?  Well, this was one of those times of getting burned - in more than one sense.  I received a breakfast burrito that was scorched.   I mean this in the most literal sense, the exterior of the burrito was speckled with black marks the size of a dime.  It was so badly burned that I could smell it even before I opened the wrapping. The smell permeated my car. This is the scent that only occurs when oil has been heated too hot, well above scorching levels.  But the burning affect doesn't stop at the exterior of the tortilla.  Oh no. Inside the eggs had been cooked the same way - scorched from too much heat.   It's obvious Armandos is cooking with their oil way too hot and the food ends up smelly with black specs inside and out.    Funny, the green peppers inside were raw.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HEALTH INSPECTION RECORD  Inspected Date Major Violations  Score Purpose Award  1/10/2011                 4                       49        ROUTINE INSPECTION  NO AWARD

Now to ordering lunch.  I didn't even look at the menu because I've read the Yelp reviews of Jesse and Darren, so think I'm informed.  In a decisive sweep of confidence I ask for the Chipotle bowl  .... and get blank stares.  They don't know what this is.  I finally look at the menu and its not there.  I order the closest thing, The sizzling bowl.  It arrives and is just what I ordered, a bowl of rice, some chopped small chicken smothered in Spicy sauce with a few Jalapenos.  Add a small drink and I'm at $8.90 with tax.  Although plentiful It was just OK, absent of any veggies but then again all of the bowls are just meat, rice, and sauce except the Veggie Bowl.  The girls from the office that I took here for lunch glared at me.  This is not the good glare either.  PS - A day later the charge showed up on my credit card online statement as BOBBY C's CAFE

Sherrie in service was exemplary.  I had a hood lift strut that would hold for about 10 secs and slowly let the hood drop on my 2011 Audi.  No problem, got a next day appointment a sweet loaner 2015 A3 and even accommodated my wish for an early oil change.    Smooth all the way around, no time off work for me and the service dept did more than expected; brake wear measured and the car detailed inside and out ( it was really dirty).  This was my first venture away from my old dealer at Audi N Scottsdale and Audi Chandler was quite a step up - especially in the detailing dept. Thank you

I visited Desert Title & Tag (aka Desert Title) on a referral from a friend.  I wanted to buy a car from out of state and had received conflicting info from MVD offices about what needed to be notarized.  The blonde lady greeted us and checked her sheet then cleared up that question.  She asked if I wanted a price quote and I gave her the VIN.   I now had all the info I needed. Bought the car, came back and the fees were exactly as quoted.  Took under 10 mins for an out of State transfer, new plates, sticker and registration.  Wow, that is service that you don't get at the State run offices!

The local Ferrari club took us here and I can see why; a very nice place that is a bit dressier, authentic Napolese style oven, home made dough, fresh ingredients, crafty styles of pizza to choose from, great selection of drinks and reasonable prices.  Parking is awfully tight and the place can get very busy but I'll fight that and would recommend to bring friends here.

Wonderful location, splendid food, extremely fast and VERY attentive service.  This would be an easy 5 star rating in anyone else's book but I hold those for super special ratings.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Our group of 8 arrived after the monthly Cars N Coffee event and as we strolled in we changed our group size from 6 to 8 within minutes yet were warmly greeted and the change was no problem.    The setting was wonderful and beverage orders were quickly taken as we were given options for the daily specials.  I spied the Crepes Tutti Frutti and at $7.25 was pleasantly greeted with a large crepe of abundant fresh blueberries, strawberries, raspberries covered with whip cream and almonds then drizzled with honey.  Sacre bleu!  I will be back - Thank you.

Only tried their lunch menu so far.  $11.47 for Brisket sandwich, 2 sides and their smallest soda(size=large) + tax.   Great brisket, fair prices, and generous portions.  Very tasty and stands well without the sauce.  I found the Smokey sauce the best flavor of the three offered but it also tastes a bit too salty.  I found I enjoyed lunch without the sauce and that is exactly how it is served - saucless.  My two sides were the Sweet Potatoe Fries and Potato Salad.  Both were 2 thumbs up but you get more fries than potato salad.  If quantity counts, then weigh that in.  Lunch was a bit crowded and seating was tough to come by.  Every server there seemed concerned that we would enjoy our visit.  Bottom line: I'll be back and it is worth seeking out.  Really want to try their Pork next!  PS - Gotta pay attention to find it.  Look for the coffee shop facing Deer Valley Road, with the Green sign that mimics Starbucks. PoF is located adjacent and behind that.

I sought this out because Yelp caught my eye with it being on their "Best of Yelp Phoenix Restaurants" so I made a deliberate drive to get there, ate what I though was representative and think Yelp has this one wrong.  First of all Yelp, it isn't a restaurant that you claim but a food truck, a very small food truck.  But I had read the Yelp reviews and knew that.  I stepped up and had trouble finding the ordering line through the people.  While there wasn't a big group ordering, about 6 people were clustered around blocking the window, apparently waiting for their orders to appear.  Turns out it would be a long wait, but good things are worth waiting for, right? I sorted through those waiting, politely asked and found there was no line and made my way to the window.   I ordered the Beef Moki and because of the positive Yelp comments, added a side of fried pickle.  Total was $8 without a drink (I got one of the fruit drinks at the other trucks there).    Window guy said it would be about 7 mins, which caused me to look at my Droid - 1:22PM.   At 1:38PM my Moki arrived but there was a few minutes more wait for the fried pickle which wasn't ready yet.  Took 20 mins total and this was well past peak lunch hour.    Sat down and looked at what I got (see photos I took).  Other Yelpers are right, the dog is small. The Moki is listed as having green chilis, onions, tomatos, pinto beans, cheddar & mayo. I was anticipating a nice SouthWestern style blend of flavors, but that was absent.  I bit in and none of these flavors jumped out, no chili heat, no flavor burst, no taste of fresh veggies melding.   What I did get was a sensation of the tough skin texture of the dog, very thick naan bread and a pinto bean absorbtion.  Turning to the fried pickle, its breading kept falling off just leaving the limp, soggy pickle.  I finished the 7 pieces of fried pickle that I had paid $3 for and wondered why the ratings were so high.    The dining area I sat in was very windy, blowing fiercely which made the experience forced; a hand off between eating and holding down anything that I had ordered.  Hours later, my iron stomach is still getting belch tones from the dog's meat spices and oil based aromas.   This isn't good.  Unless you're working right across the street and this place was the utmost in convenience, I'd pass.  The flavors didn't work or even stand out, the service was incredibly slow, and the eating area was dumpy and windy.  Spending $8 for "a dog and pickles" then add an additional cost of a drink beyond that, you are already at sit down restaurant prices found elsewhere nearby.    I just don't see what the ravings are all about at this place.  Heck, I saw a Pita Jungle a few blocks before and wondered why I would pass that up to come here.  SIDE NOTE - I went back and read some of the prior Yelp reviews.  I just don't get how reviewers are giving this place such high ratings. Here is a review that rated 4 stars but stated it was only held back from 5 stars because;  -small dog,  -undercooked naan,  -toppings flavors don't fuse together,  -neglected service,  -overpriced http://www.yelp.com/biz/short-leash-dogs-phoenix#hrid:_FrRd1SiaPMV5-sIcTWu1A wtf - Yelp, you've let me down.

Tried this in Tempe but in a quick moment of haste I asked for the works and it came that way - my mistake as I hate ketchup and Mayo on burgers as it disguises the flavors and both were included, but that was my fault.  Vowed to try it again and when I did I omitted those offenders and it was great.  Came out promptly, result was good, tasty and far better than the competition (In-N-out ).  Mid priced burger was good value and the burger seemed of comparable caliber for price.  The meat was flavorful, the bun soft and they sported crisp veggies.  Order was exactly correct on delivery. A bit pricey, but not that bad overall.  Free peanut starters are a real plus as you wait - somebody was thinking on their toes for both client's hunger and preoccupation.   PS - Note on comments that compare this place to In-N-Out , I do not consider them competition as I have seen In-N-Out as a filthy, dirty place where fries are scooped across the counter and back into the serving bin.  I searched on In 'N Out's website and it doesn't allow you to report it (like they don't care.  end of rant).

We had cashew chicken  ($12), sweet & sour chicken ($12) one brown rice and one white rice and a cup of Tom kha gai soup costing a total of $35 before tip.  Service was reasonable, food was OK but lacked intricate Thai flavors and pricing was expensive.  Last weeks trip to Nonthaporns in Mesa on Main is a superior choice

Dinner time on a Wed eve and I ordered the Med Capastrami.  Service was lightning fast and it came in a butcher paper roll. As others posted, the 12" sandwiches are long, bit into the first bite and the ample hot pastrami nearly seared me.  Enjoyed the Cole slaw and fresh bread with sauce. Yummy...will def be back

Completely uncommon for me to rate Chipotle low, but tonight's food service and prep of the rice & beans was horrible resulting in a very poor tasting meal.   Note, just last week I rated this same Chipotle 4 stars and it was deserved, but tonight makes me think this place is VERY INCONSISTENT.  I was third in a line of four people, not a very busy time at all.  Server was in a rush, a inexcusable whirling tizzy and she didn't steam my burrito well, gave me half portions of rice, black beans and chicken.  It sat there next to the guy in front of me who had ordered the exact same thing and mine was embarassingly small compared to his.  It was blatantly obvious how skimpy mine was as the two sat next to each other.  She was in such a flustered rush that after passing mine from her station to "topping guy" and then not seeing it immediately move as it was queued up behind the guy in front that she returned to move both 6 more inches as if that would get things out of her sight.  It didn't, but who cares if it takes a few more minutes?  Besides a lack of flavors, the textures were affected too.  When I received mine the tortilla hadn't been steamed well meaning it was thick and cold rather than the typical warm and soft texture.  The Cilantro rice is usually a highlight but dimished and completely lacked flavor.  Black beans were nearly missing so their normally sweet flavor was semi-absent and the cold, thick tortilla dough dominated the flavors of this Burrito. Many of the tables were dirty and hadn't been cleaned in a while.  Sorry I stopped by.   You want to see the service staff that made this such a bad experience, look at the photo I posted.

This is my secret spot for the WOW of a special date.   View, service and food are all high quality, parking is easy and close.   It is pricey, so I recommend going for lunch (they start late - at Noon)  BTW, Did I mention the sweeping view?!

Stopped in for lunch and the open air, high doors are great in the high 70's temps of March.

I had the Chicken Mint salad and it was a wonderful balance of flavors, spice and heat, highlighted by mint.  Refreshing and tasty, hot and bright.  A touch of spice producing some heat, but well balanced and flavorful. The salad was a full meal but it was a hot day in the 90's so I also had the standard Iced Tea which was flavored with peach.  Service was prompt and my tea never went empty...all four times. $8 for the salad, $2 for the tea.  I'd return and try other dishes, very nice.

I walked in and it was the first time I had ever been to a Smashburger.  The place was not too brightly lit (5 guys get a clue), had nice seats, it was clean and had a very good first impression.   I had followed a young couple in and it was obvuious they were on a date so it was good enough for them to pick as a destination. Menu greeted me at he doorway so you could a have a look at it, proceeded forward to order and the wait staff was polite and nice.  Definitely upscale from the competitors.  Food arrived quickly.  I had read Yelp reviews, so was prepared and had the 1/3rd Smashburger, sweet potato smashfries and soda totalling just under $10.  Music was a little too loud in the dining room, the burger was tasty, but as soon as I raised it there was a puddle or juices that dropped out.  It was fresh and I liked the generous veggies on it.  The sweet potatoe fries were mystifying; didn't know whether to put ketchup on them or not.  They also had an Italian herbal flavor (oregano, basil ?) and while tasty are not something I'd normally order.  Summary:  Very nice place, good food, good ambience and just a tad out of the ordinary to be striking.

First time here, came for lunch and realize they serve many different meals at all times of day.  I only tried one of the lunch bowls and a small soda.  For $8.90 I'd not do it again.  It wasn't great but it wasn't inspiring either.  Rice, highly chopped chicken, jalapenos and a heavy sauce.  Again, they might have other foods which are worth it but I would not go back for one of the bowls.  Ever heard the saying "Jack of all trades, master of none".   Its a donut shop, its a deli, its a cafe, its a family restaurant, its an Asian fast food place...well, we found out differently  We were looking for something different for lunch so turned to Yelp and decided to try the "Ninja Bowl".  Then found there is no place with this name.  No street sign, no door marker legend, no mailbox.  Nothing.  We had to do some hunting and asking (I hate asking) and found out the truth.  There are four names on Yelp for the same address and same location: 1) Ninja Bowl http://www.yelp.com/biz/ninja-bowl-phoenix aka 2) Rainbow Donuts Bakery & Cafe http://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-bakery-and-cafe-phoenix aka 3) Rainbow Donuts & Deli http://www.yelp.com/biz/rainbow-donuts-and-deli-phoenix aka 4) Bobby C's Cafe http://www.yelp.com/biz/bobby-cs-cafe-phoenix  All the same address, phone number and location.  I charged it on my Credit Card and it showed up on my bill as Bobby C's Cafe.  Had a terrible time finding it and while I only tried the Sizzling bowl the cost of $8.90 for rice, finely chopped chicken and gluten spicey sauce plus small soda doesn't warrant another visit.

Should have believed the old but correct Yelp reviews.    Yes this is a Filibertos but it is literally inside the gas station market.  They had specials listed on the board by the cash register and I pointed to the Green Chili Burrito special.  I paid and stepped aside then saw the drink included in the ad and inquired.  The cashier said I needed to order the special to get the drink and the burrito in that special is much smaller.   I asked to change to the special and he responded that it was different and not possible, probably since the order was already being worked.   Oh well...  For my $4.80 it was finely chopped meat, green sauce and flour tortilla

Highly recommend, wonderful food, adequate wine selection and atmosphere that wasn't too loud for conversation but still was rockin'  Ms. D and I were busy running errands in the area and didn't have time to cook so she suggested we turn to Yelp and have dinner out.  A quick look in the area and we decided to try Federal Pizza (noticed Federal was near our favorite Postino).  We arrived in casual clothes and although it was a 30 min wait we were seated quickly.  I was starving and we got on our orders of The TLC Salad and a Big Star pizza.  For a first visit we nailed it; the salads was fresh, crisp and flavorful while the pizza was amazingly wonderful crust with fresh ingredients.  The sauce was the only ambiguous part of the meal as it didn't really come through; not that this is a bad thing just that the fresh toppings and the wonderful crust was so overwhelmingly good.  Ms. D enjoyed her Home made cooler and I thought the Primitivo wine wasn't especially great.  But did I mention the crust on the pizza was tasty (LOL).  Parking is a bit weird and while they have complimentary Valet which only allows one way entrance I did not really want to check my car that evening.

$12 for two tacos and a courtesy glass of water in a walk up order line. Nice interior and tasty fast food but small portions which makes it not so great of a value

Great $13 haircut! Saw them as I was driving by, stopped in and got a nice haircut. They use high pressure air to blow off the cuttings on the apron so that can be a little loud - you know, the same sort that you fill tires with!
