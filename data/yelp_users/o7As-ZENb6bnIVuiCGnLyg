Awesome customer service! I had my wife's grandfathers ring repaired here and it was a job well done.  The ladies who helped me were over-the-top nice and even offered me a COLD bottled water as I waited for another quick fix.  I would reccomend this place for all jewelery repairs.  Great service and very fair pricing.

I have enjoyed Postino's for a long time.  The Monday and Tuesday night madness are for those who have the patience to have a great deal.  This location is great due to the patio and indoor seating.  I've always enjoyed the prosciutto with brie sandwich.  Try to bring cash when possible for valet.. Parking can get pretty crazy.   Service is always Outstanding!  Worth the drive and wait!

I have had ordered take out at least a dozen times. Every meal was excellent and they have the best horchata!  My recommendations would be carnitas fajitas, veggie burrito and taco salad. I would suggest you give this place a try and don't forget the salsa bar.

I stop in for lunch here a lot.  They are very good about getting you through the line quick and have a great quality meal.  I enjoy the steak tacos and burrito bowls.   The entire restaurant was very clean.  There is plenty of space for seating and the high top seating is nice for single eaters.  Very consistent with different items and always enjoyed my meals.

Consistently the best Italian meals!! I have enjoyed every dinner and it is a great place to bring family or a date.  Bring a nice bottle of wine with you and enjoy home-made Italian dishes.  The cheesecake is worth saving room for!

If there is something on the television then this place will have it! There are tv's everywhere which is pretty awesome.  There is seating all over and a great place for groups of 15+ people.  There is a separate side for pool and darts where you have to be 21 which is nice.  They have good craft beer selections as well as awesome drink specials.  Their wings are so gwwooooood!  Holy buckets if you enjoy wings you need to try these!   Televisions all over for every type of game or event and great food and drink.  Not a bad place for the kids to enjoy a sports bar/restaurant.

Always consistent pizza and wings.  The management is great!  One night after work I was headed home and called 10 minutes before they closed.  The manager made my order of naked well done wings and was very delightful that I gave them business.  I have ordered from this location several times and always had great food and service.  I have not dinned in only done take-out and the customer sercive again is great!  This is one of the only places that I know you can have a great meal close to closing time.

Nice store. The lady who took my order was having a lot of conversation with her fellow employees as opposed to listening to the order.  All the tables were dirty and needed to be cleaned.  My wife doesn't like to bring food home because she would rather enjoy right after being made. We wont eat in again because we had to listen to the staff gossip and eat at a dirty table.  Food was consistent with other subways but run by children.

I come here with the wife often and never leave disappointed.  I always seem to enjoy the fish tacos the best.  They are lighter and you don't leave stuffed because their portions are very big.  One word to the wise is not to order the margarita by the pitcher.  My wife and I did and it doesn't taste better as the drink goes on.  Too watered down and not a good taste.  We also sat inside for the first time and enjoyed it a lot.  Great Mexican place north of the 101!!

Finally, a great all around dinner.  I ordered the NY Strip which was prepared perfectly.  The server was excellent.  Gave great menu descriptions of flavors and suggested sides and wine with our meal.  My wife had the grilled salmon which had a great light flavor.  Next time we make the reservations we will request for the same server he really made the experience wonderful. The best part was that the entire restaurant was packed and the kitchen made it seamless.  Awesome fresh food and above and beyond service.

Stopped in for a quick lunch.  I only had 20 minutes and was in and out in 15.  There was enough customers to say it was busy and the staff was great about getting everyone through the line quick.  I had my sub within 5 minutes of walking in the door.  Great place to stop for people in a hurry!  All the tables were nice and clean which was enjoyable.

This location rocks.  My wife and I go in a couple times a month for lunch during week.  Even when the place is packed they still give awesome service and food.  While enjoying lunch a gentleman who worked there asked to refill our drinks and take away garbage.  Doesn't matter how busy it may look its always worth the wait.

My favorite Costco in the valley.  Walking in your always greeted by someone nice and personable.  My wife and I were walking past the different selections of meat and noticed they were a little low on rib-eyes. One of the butchers noticed we were looking a litter harder and opened the sliding glass door and asked if he could help.  We told him what we were looking for and within 2 minutes he cut us a 4 pack and off we went.  We generally like to visit this Costco after 6:30 because the store isn't the busiest.  Great place always new items to check out, best customer service!

Awesome airport to fly in and out of with ease.  The security line has never been longer than 5 minutes for me when traveling.  Getting to the gate only takes a minute or two and plenty of space for people to have a seat and wait.  The only thing I know is that the parking can be expensive.  They used to have free parking but that changed and like any airport its expensive when you have to pay for it.  Otherwise, this is a great airport to travel in and out!

Stopped in for lunch to meet a colleague.  It was noon and the place was super busy.  Although it was really busy I was able to go through the line quickly and have my lunch in front of me within 5 minutes.  Prices are average for a deli and the food quality is great!  If you are in a pinch for time this is a reliable stop for a quick bite!

Had a wonderful dinner here with the family.  I have discovered my personal favorite pasta dish here and that is the Ricotta Gnocchi.  The Gnocchi is fresh made and taste wonderful with braised short rib, horseradish crema and wilted arugula.  My wife had the Grilled Branzino and it also was an amazing dish.  If your planning on walking in for dinner try to show up early to put your name in.  Very busy place but worth the wait for amazing food!

My wife and I come here once a month when the budget permits us.  Having grown up in a BBQ Restaurant in Alabama I must say this is the best BBQ West of the Mississippi!  I personally enjoy the 1/3 rack of ribs with Brisket and 2 sides. I have never been a fan of potato salad, that being said Bryan's has the most amazing potato salad I have ever had!!  The BBQ beans are also very good and a little spicy.  The best side choice for me is the Slaw!!  Ribs are always smoked to perfection here.  When we place our order we make sure to place a TOGO as well (usually always chopped brisket, 1lb.)  The prices for food are well worth it! The drive is definitely worth it! Knowing that I'll be back for more... Worth it every time!!

Having a great store open 24/7 is great.  I have loved this F & Easy since it first opened.  The staff here is really nice and friendly and the store has always been super clean.  Everything is well organized and easy to reach.   My favorite things to buy here are the salad dressings.  Poppy seed is my personal favorite followed by the tuscan.  This is also a great place to stop for a quick lunch on the go!  If you enjoy shopping for ingredients and cooking them later that day F & Easy is the place to shop!

I want to give these guys 5 stars because they have great customer service and advise for home needs.  I come into this store a few times a month and any question I present has an answer.  The store itself is always clean and very friendly.  I get the mail letter with the deals that go on and they are great.  I think overall the pricing here is good and much better than home depot or lowes.

I tried out this place because I didn't care for the last place I had my suits dry cleaned.  The service is great and the pricing is spot on.  I had to take a week long business trip and these guys were able to fold all my shirts with plastic wrapped around.  This worked amazing for packing reasons.  Great cleaners!

I don't come in here too often but I must say the customer service is really nice.  I was pacing back and forth for different nails and screws for the last minute home improvements that the wife wants done for the house. A gentleman quickly gave some pointers and suggestions.  I would suggest that if you have a question speak up because they are really good with product knowledge and installation for most things.

Not a hit!  I would like to think I am a BBQ Connoisseur which is why my wife went out of her way to get a gift card for us to visit. Very small place located just South of the Deer Valley Airpark.   Food:  I had a brisket sandwich with coleslaw and corn bread.  Brisket was not warm and bland.  The coleslaw wasn't terrible however finding the black hair halfway through didn't sit well with my stomach.  I did notice that NON of the employees were wearing hats or hairnets so that is a possible reason why.  The cornbread was a premium side which didn't make sense because of how small it was.  It was like a mini muffin which was cold to the point that the cool butter that was placed inside didn't melt.  The bottom half was completely stale and inedible.  My wife had the pork sandwich in which she agreed that it wasn't a very enjoyable.  She had coleslaw as well as the baked beans.  Nothing amazing to comment on here.    Service:  The service was brief because food was served out of chauffeurs.  Similar to a quick serve the food clearly wasn't made fresh.  Nice people I am sure but there is no engagement other than ordering.  I would not recommend pork on a fork because I have enjoyed many other BBQ Places around the valley.  If I wasn't given a gift card I wouldn't of visited and overall I was disappointed.

Tuesday's kids eat free! That was a great start, I have a younger set of twin siblings that are 5 years old.  And since they ordered off the kiddie menu their meals were free.   I had the bacon & blue burger and it was grilled to perfection!  Medium-rare and juicy, YUM.  My wife had the turkey burger and it wasn't too appealing however, she said she enjoyed it (she only ate 4 bites, not sure how much she enjoyed it.)   My dad had a BYO burger and he enjoyed it as well.   We all enjoyed happy hour drinks which goes from 3-7pm.  Overall the food was really good I just feel that the service could have been better if she was a little more personable.  She wasn't very attentive and when she would drop items off at the table she would quickly walk away before anyone could order anything else.  Televisions were everywhere and you could watch any game where ever you sit in the restaurant.  Good place to watch sports!

This was a great experience.  With a group of people and did a tour through the brewery.  I like how they have cocktail tables in the brewery so you can enjoy the brewing environment.  I really enjoyed all their beers but the IPA was the best.  Good place to stop in for a craft beer.

Love this place!  I went in for brunch and had a tasty Churrasco Steak and Eggs.  This was a great menu item cooked to perfection.  I also enjoyed a flight of different beers that they brewed in house.  The O.H.S.O. Grovey was my favorite.  I usually don't like orange in a beer however this brew tasted amazing!  The Happy IPA was also really gwwooooood!

I have been into SOL many times and really don't expect too much when I go.  The margaritas have tasted different each time.  Bartenders seem to free pour too much and aren't consistent with one another.  The bartenders however, are very aware and social which is a plus.   I will say that the Naked Guac is really good in addition to the Civeche Sol.   The bar area is a little difficult to get to once people are seated in the restaurant. The bar itself is beautiful and neat but not convenient if you have more than 4 in your party.   The only reason I stayed with 2 stars is because I have not seem a bathroom like this since a college frat party.  There were paper towels all over the ground and the divider for the mens urinal looks like it is about to fall off the wall at any time.   The bathroom is used by staff in addition to patrons so I would think there is an opportunity to have it a little nicer..

I had to replace a screen for my phone that I dropped.  These guys were able to fix it quick in addition to getting me an otter box case for a real good price.   Their prices were better than best buy and sprint.  I would recommend CPR to anyone who is looking for great customer service and best pricing for accessories and fixing of phones!  Their turn around time was also outstanding!

Customer service is amazing here!  I had to rent a car for 2 weeks because my vehicle was in the shop.  I looked these guys up on yelp and decided to roll the dice.  Great decision!  When you walk into this place the energy is great and the customer service is top notch!  I would recommend this location over the others because they have the biggest selection of cars for great deals.  From the basic coup that will get 30+ miles the the gallon or a new 2014 Stingray Corvette!  Renting from this place will be a great experience!

No one can do it better than Care Schmidt!  When my wife brought up the fact that she wanted a wedding planner I was a little hesitant because I didn't know what the $$ would get us.  My wife/fiancee at the time set up a meeting at a Starbucks for a greet and meet.  After sitting down and talking about the different options I was speechless.  She had a few different avenues to pursue being our wedding planner.  From the get go Care was so personable and professional we instantly were charged with excitement and enthusiasm.   Care instantly changed my perception of wedding planners.  Before I had really only heard negative things from friends experiences with their planners.  Too bad they didn't have Care!   Now it has been a over a month since our wedding and I still think back to the Wedding and Reception when Care was right by our side for everything.  I had a few concerns during the reception and Care was right there to take care of business.  And I really wouldn't even call it business because it is so natural for her to trouble shoot any issue or problem and have the best outcome.  I Love this woman, she made my wedding spectacular and it couldn't of been so wonderful without her guidance and expertise.  She is an ALLSTAR!  Just know one thing about Care Schmidt, she always takes, "Care" of people!

Went in for a quick happy hour drink because I had some time to kill before meeting the family at outback steakhouse.  I actually went to outback first but after realizing that their beer and drink selection was crap I decided to head over to blue 32.  The bartender Steph was really nice and engaging in conversation.  I ended up having 2 drinks before meeting the family and will be back on a Sunday when their 4 Peaks beer selection is only $4 for a 22oz.  Good time and friendly bartenders!

Copper Mule to start followed by delicious Louisiana Boudin Fritters.  These fritters were great and spicy.  The rotisserie pork is outstanding!  Very tender and full of flavor.  Dessert was a rich chocolate truffle cake, again very awesome.  Our server was very helpful with suggestions and descriptions.  The open kitchen is a great touch, fun to watch the Chef's in action.

My wife and I went in just before 9pm, which is over an hour before they close.  As we walked in we noticed an employee standing on the grill (which was off with no lights on) taking down the hoods to clean.  After noticing the early closing duties being done, we looked to see that all the selections of proteins were at the bottom of the pan except for the barbacoa.   My wife ordered the chicken tacos, which had a clear sign stating that they had an OUTAGE of their regular chicken indicating that the chicken they were currently serving, wasn't organic and contained hormones. No biggie its just chicken right?  I ordered the barbacoa burrito simply because it looked like it was the freshest item made to offer.  After sitting down to eat I took two bites and realized that my entire burrito was cold.  I opened the burrito and stuck my finger right into the center to realize that it was not the slight bit warm but entirely cold including the barbacoa.  Went inside to make the Manager aware that the barbacoa was cold.   The manager simply stirred up the meat and tasted a sample for himself.  His reply was, "yeah its not very warm but that probably because we haven't touched it and stirred it enough..  We don't cook this here, it comes in cooked and we only re-heat it."   That pretty much solved the question at hand, they don't cook the barbacoa there and they don't even re-heat it to a sanitary temperature.  I would think these employees have gone through a food training class where the FDA clearly states that between 50 and 140F there can be rapid growth of bacteria in beef.  Food has to be kept above 140F otherwise bacteria starts to grow and doubles every 20 minutes.  This manager had no concern what so ever to be apologetic because he was clearly more interested in closing although they were open for another hour.  I received a refund per my request for the meal and didn't even get an apology.  I would suggest that no one eat at this chipotle after 8pm.  The staff is too focused on closing rather than providing a quality product.  http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/BuyStoreServeSafeFood/ucm328131.htm

Only go here for happy hour with family.   The saki sangria is delicious and a good happy hour drink.  I started off with the cucumber salad and it was great.  I love the sweet vinaigrette dressing that they put on there.  Between the three of us we normally split 4 rolls.  Crunchy shrimp is my favorite!  Tootsie and salmon sushi-mi are great too!  The service this past time was great, before we have had some bad service but that's because of the servers age and culture I am sure.  If you want great happy hour sushi check this place out.  Our bill is never over $40!

Hoppymoto is the man!!  My wife purchased this brewery tour as a Christmas gift and it was a blast!  Hoppymoto (John) is a great and very knowledgeable.  Not to mention he is a safe driver!  We started our tour at the O.H.S.O. Brewery and enjoyed the flight of beers with Brunch.  From there we ventured to Phoenix Ale Brewery and had some more awesome beers.  We ended our tour at the North Mountain Brewery which again was awesome.  Hoppymoto really has a connection with all of these brewers and was able to be very detailed with information.    If you have the opportunity, go on a Brewery Tour!  It is a great time and you get to meet some cool people as well.  This was a great gift to receive.   THANKS HOPPYMOTO!

This was our last stop after visiting D&B.  The patio is great with an awesome outside bar.  The inside is just as nice with televisions all over the place.  Given that we went after 11pm the music was cranked and drinks were everywhere.  Security was really nice and I.D.ed our group quick.    The only reason I would give this place 2 out of 5 is because of how dirty the place was.  Every patio table standing or sitting was littered with cups and food.  Nothing was cleaned off for new guests to enjoy.  We ended up at a standing table on the patio and just stacked all the drinks that were left there and took them to the bar to help.  The place wasn't busy at all so I really don't understand why the service staff wasn't able to help tidy the place up.    This place unfortunately reminded me of a movie theater that just let out.. Sticky floors and garbage all over.  Hopefully they will step it up so that newer guests have a spot to hang out and not just stand around..

Whether it is for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner this place has been consistent!  I have enjoyed visiting Topgolf every time I have gone.  The place has just recently opened but it seems their kinks are getting worked out better and better with each visit.  I would suggest 6 people per bay because of space and time to play.  Food and drinks are awesome and well prepared!    Word to the wise if your planning on visiting for your first time.. Go online to topgolf.com and register for a membership.  It costs $5 which is the same for in store purchase however, it will SAVE you A LOT of time.  If you register online you can walk in and they will print the membership card right away.  Just be sure to have you RE # from the confirmation email!   This is a great place to visit for all ages.  I just recently was there with my twin brother and sister ages 4 and my 83 year old grandmother.  Everyone hit balls and had a great time!  Weekends are certainly the busiest so plan ahead.  Even in this 100 degree weather they have all the bays chilled with fans and misters.

Went in to check out Happy Hour as well as the new digs.  Small bar and restaurant.  Give it 2 because a happy hour margarita was $5.50.. I would think a batch margarita out of a coke keg would be less.  The margarita itself was terrible.  Tasted like the bottom of a sour mix, not refreshing at all. Bartender salted the rim like a Chicago driveway in a deep freeze, yuck.  The beer price for happy hour was $4 which is a much better option than the margarita.  Still for happy hour the prices were high.  Location is also a tough spot. The bartender was nice and social, doubt I'd give this place another shot.

David is a real nice gentleman.  I took in a few watches to have repaired and was able to pick up the next day.  When I picked them up David took the time to go over some useful information about the watches and even warned me that one wasn't fully sealed to support water.   David's store is nice and small.  They have an assorment of different types of jewlery in various displays.  This is a great place to look for a gift or have repairs done.  Credible store with great service.

It is nice to see a new place up here in this location.  Mexican food is definitely my favorite and this food ROCKS!!  My first time in I enjoyed the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi was fantastic!  It is served with an amazing aioli, slaw, and the rice and beans.  If you like street tacos or a la carte they have those tacos too! The second time I had the shrimp ceviche & steak fajitas. The ceviche was great.  Fresh and plenty for a little meal but, holy cow those fajitas are gwwooooood!!  Served with fresh veggies and fresh tortillas.   The decor for the restaurant is great.  A modern theme for a restaurant it has high ceilings with nice tables and booths.  The restrooms are also nice and adds to the quality of the building. I will be back because they have happy hour until 7pm!  Great place to visit!
