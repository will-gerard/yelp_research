If I could give less than 1 star I would. I only got a medium strawberry limeade. Had maybe 5 baby sips because it tasted horrible. Dumped it all out and found lettuce in it. I'm never coming back here again.

I lift things up, I put them down. I lift things up, I put them down. Staff is friendly. The only thing that annoys me are the *cough*women*cough* who are there when I go. Sitting on machines for 10 minutes and only doing one set of 5 reps. The women who sweat all over equipment and never wipe them down after using them. And the dumb chick with her purse by her, texting on her cell phone while wearing flip flops. Because like omg, she couldn't like tear herself away from her Facebook or twitter or Instagram or texting her Beiber boyfriend. Pick up your paper towels too!!!!!!

Wow! Rude employees here. I politely informed the cashier that the turtle flipped on its back. Yeah, I know turtles can use their legs and neck to right themselves up again. But I also know if they can't, they'll die of starvation & dehydration. Point is, not enough room for the turtle with all the other crap in his aquarium. Then upon leaving, the cashier did a "grrrr" to her manager like she's the turtle whisperer and we were aggravating her. You work at a Petsmart, you're not a zoologist. I was just a concerned customer. I will never go to this location ever again due to miss tall, short brown hair, pierced nose' attitude.

Could this place be anymore crowded? I can't get down the aisles, due to crowding of staff, other customers running into me. One gigantic cluster fudge. I did end up buying Kale for my greek tortoise but that is everywhere so I won't be returning. Even then there is no order to checking out. Everyone just cuts in front of you and my God I couldn't get out of there fast enough.

Went here to eat tonight for dinner. Our fault for coming right in the middle of dinner rush but didn't think the wait would be too bad as we sat in the bar area. It took a good 15 minutes before we were acknowledged. The olive oil without our bread was the first red flag. More than 5 minutes later possibly more our bread came. Our drinks arrived 20 minutes after that. We were there a good hour before we actually got our entrees and the icing on the cake were the people who sat down behind us a good 30-40 minutes after we arrived got their food first. We ordered fettuccine Alfredo and pasta Milano. The waiter asked if we would like Parmesan and I stupidly said yes. I watched him go to get it but also watched him stop at two other tables and do other things in the process. A manager came over apologizing because he understood we waited so long for our food. I can only assume our food was sitting the pass forever before the waiter brought it to us. And the manager took less time to go get Parmesan but by the time he got back, our waiter finally remembered to come back with it. Again, I understand that they were busy and I know they are running around constantly but this was ridiculous. It just seemed like our waiter wasn't too concerned with how long we were waiting. Two stars for the manager caring more. The people sitting at the actual bar were getting better service!!  Update 5/14: just found out that this place has closed.

Panda Express, I wish I could quit you! Especially after I stupidly keep coming back to this location. The staff here can't multi-task. When they try to, that's when people's food starts to get mixed up and down and around. Let's focus on one person at a time. That's great that you want to help 10 people at a time but again the staff can't handle that. Especially Jesus, good luck at successfully telling him you'd like a 3 item entree. *slow blinks* He's way too flustered.   You guys write what I want on my container so why do I constantly have to remind you for the third item like 5 times?   The last time I was here there was nobody else and I waited too long to get service. We were acknowledged by a staff member sweeping but....................I guess his brain wasn't sending signals to his feet that day to walk over immediately to take our order.  Eventually something clicked up there that paying customers were waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting to get service. OMG

I love this place! Cute items for sale here and was great for Christmas shopping. Great for all year round shopping. I love seeing their well mannered Collie and the owners/ staff are very nice. Will definitely return and have told several people about this cute little place. Love it!!

Spending the day with my Aunt and Mom we stopped in here to have a beer. The crappiest beer I've ever had. If you're not a Florence local first thank your lucky stars and second prepare to be stared at. The bartender needs to wear a clean bra if she's going to wear a shirt that showcases it. Well, she needs to wear a bra that fits.

I don't understand why this place has as many stars as it does. Your palate has to be awful to nonexistent if you think the food here is superb. First of all, the hostess was plain weird. She may have been drinking since it was happy hour. Second, too much crap on the table. Too many plates, too many bowls, too many carafes of salsa, too many cups. Oh and the salsa and/or hot sauce is tomato paste. The chips are okay, not the yummiest. The Cabo Maragarita is cool to look at but it tastes mediocre. I had a border chimichanga (bean) and it was ok. Honestly. You have to be kidding me if you think this is good Mexican food. I'll just call this place McNando's because it's so Americanized and bland. Might I suggest an awesome place? Go to Los Dos Molinos. Leave Nando's to the senior citizens because this is far from authentic.

I am beyond pleased with the service these guys do. I needed my lawnmower serviced and a week later it is back looking brand new and works wonderfully. They are professional, friendly and their prices are super great! Try them out before going anywhere else!!! I'm so glad that I went to them. One happy customer. =)

Rosalie at customer service should probably watch what she says about customers of different cultures and races. People are always watching. Then to bash on that customer to another customer? Not so customer service Rosalie.

Hayden Hidalgo...stop leaving your crap flyers in unwanted sections of stores. Your gym sucks and you make it almost impossible for someone to cancel their membership.

Angelyn is SO nice. Always smiling and in a great mood.   My fiancé comes in here to get his unemployment money cashed (still healing from hip surgery) and she asks how he is and even about me if I'm not with him. Just wanted to express how lovely she is.

Wow, talk about unfriendly. Gina working the drive thru needs an attitude adjustment. Sorry I made you work? If you hate working you can quit. Learn how to smile too. Just rubs me the wrong way when I smile and am nice and I'm greeted with someone with a crap attitude. She seemed so put off that I spent money there. Man, maybe I shouldn't have.

For some reason I either seem to have bad luck with phone chargers or they just aren't made to last that long. I've had to replace a charger for my phone about 5 times now. The last time I was in there I personally thanked them on how great their customer service is everytime I am in there.

So the produce area is a bit crowded to say the least. No twist ties which aggravated me. Thank God I had twist ties saved in my purse from last grocery shopping from a different location. Look by the bananas, that was the only place I could find twist ties.   Visited the deli to get sliced roast beef and Leigh was very courteous.   The layout of this store makes more sense to me versus the layout at the location at Gilbert Rd. And Baseline. Paper towels are down the baby aisle. Mmmk.   Upon check out Melissa the cashier and Megan the bagger were both extremely really nice and no awkward conversation. Megan was extremely efficient at bagging groceries. (If you go to Gilbert and Baseline Rd. location you will notice how sssslllloooww the baggers are, with very little personality too). They made checkout enjoyable.   I managed to put some extra twist ties into my purse for next trip. Didn't know they were a hot commodity.

I'm hooked on the Turkey Bacon Ranch and the Club on a Sub. The whole staff is awesome and I've gotten some people addicted to this place like me. Subway was dead to me the moment I finished my first sub here! I've not had one bad experience here, no matter how busy it gets.

Wow how this place has gone downhill. Ate from here yesterday, our food was to go. The employees all look like they woke up 10 minutes prior and the lack of consistency with getting a pickle for not just one sandwich but both sandwiches paid for. I'll never eat here again just because the sandwich did not sit right.

What's up with not handing out utensils with drive thru orders? Cutting costs? Pretty inconsistent. Those working the drive thru window couldn't care less if they get your order right. One morning I had to wait 10 minutes while the chick was too busy refilling hot sauce, meanwhile my food is sitting in the pass. Pay attention?

I am blown away by the ER night crew on 1/23. I brought my fiancé in with what was thought to be severe left knee pain. After getting an x-Ray, we were told he suffered a left femoral fracture. There are so many that need special recognition, from the ER, the surgeon and the nurses on the 4th floor. Everyone was professional, treated my fiancé with respect and went above and beyond. I would love to recognize people by name if contacted because there were so many shining stars from the point of arrival to being discharged on the 26th.

Most of the baristas that work here have snobby, dgaf looks on their faces all the time. It's actually unsettling going inside that location. 2 stars only because of a young gentleman that works in the mornings. Don't know his name but he's super friendly, always smiling and has great customer service. The rest of the staff could pick up tips from him.  Update: I did finally get that young mans name and tipped him $5 and told him that he's always so nice when he works drive thru. Matt is doing a fine job at customer service. His smile and friendliness go a long way.

I love this place. I went in a couple weeks ago to find a gift for someone and walked out with a few more items. I've been back since and have told others about this store. So many cute items. The staff is friendly. I'll definitely be back!

Went here for the first time since I've been hearing a lot about this place. I had the double charburger with avocado and no onions. The wait wasn't long at all and it was pretty delicious. The fries were tastey as well and it's an appropriate amount of fries. I'd recommend going here definitely.

The staff here is rude. I go there maybe once a month because my bf likes going there. So it's usually on a Friday night. There is one rude female bartender that acts so put off when someone wants to order a beer. Also, if your windows connecting the patio to the bar are broken, FIX THEM!!! You often feel ignored when you're here and trying to unwind from the week over some beers. All in all, it's just a horrible location for a bar. You can't see it from the road, plus the fact that it's changed business names three times now. Molly Brannigan's, then Shakespeare's, now The Harp. What's it gonna be called next? Ha! Oh and the bands are extremely WAY too loud. Especially if we're on the patio and the windows are closed because they are broken and I still can't hear myself think. This place just goes further downhill with each business name change.

Me and my fiancé ate here for the first time today and the food was delicious. I had a blood orange margarita for my drink which was very yummy. We both decided to do the 3 tacos and a side of our choosing. I got a carne asada, the standard and a shrimp taco with a side of black beans. The fiancé got a carne asada, carnitas and a baja fish taco with pinto beans as a side. The weather was nice out so we sat on the outside patio while enjoying our visit here. We will definitely be back for sure!!

First time visiting this cute little bakery as was recommended by a friend. I picked up a half dozen cupcakes and they are almost too pretty to eat. Almost! They are simply delicious. The best cupcakes I have ever had. I can't wait to come back here and will spread the word about this place.

Tried this place out for the very first time today and was very pleased with the experience. Upon walking in, one of the waiters greeted us with fist bumps and pulled out the table so my fiancé (on crutches) could slide into the booth side easier. What I loved is the waiters/waitresses talk to you like old friends and they are having a great time. We both had yo momma's biscuits n gravy and shared the stupid fries. Both dishes were amazing and tastey! The portions are big so come with an empty stomach but if you can't finish, no worries, you can take the rest home with you. We'll definitely be back. I want to try the Purplesaurus Rex. Jazmine was our waitress, so shout out to her and the whole staff really as everyone is friendly!

Decided to finally try out the food here after hearing others mention it. We went early afternoon so we didn't have to wait long for a booth. I decided to try one of their margaritas. La reyna poloma margarita is tastey and I was happy with my choice. Strong and delicious. The chips were ok. Some were a little chewy and a huge chunk was stuck together but that's ok. For my meal I decided on the Barrio pollo burrito and our waiter suggested trying the chorizo added into it. I'm glad I got the chorizo because it made the burrito super yummy. My fiancé got the Arizona burrito and he enjoyed his. The waiters here are friendly and attentive and answer any questions about the food on the menu. We'll be back!
