The wash I received did not take off the bird remains on my sun roof, and the interior had areas of attention that I had specifically I asked to be addressed, but were nonetheless neglected. The saving grace was the friendly cashier. Don't waste your money here.   Pay the neighborhood kid, or your own.

Called ahead and asked how long it would take to get my snowboard waxed and edged. I was told 30 minutes.  The clerk was not at fault. The manager came and told me, right at the end of the timeline, that it would be another hour or so and that the clerk had no business promising the original timeline.  I was not offered a refund. I work in the business of leading troops and workers. Even if your clerk was at fault, you do not blame him for not upholding a timeline, and you do your best to honor it. That's piss poor leadership on the part of the manager.  I will not be returning.

Went there last night with my girlfriend and had a great Bruschetta spread. They still had my favorite fall beer as well (always worth a star or 2). The staff was friendly; it's not too crowded or loud to hear your friends. Great food and great atmosphere.

Kyle was an outstanding waiter. He was friendly and on point, even during a full house. The food was cooked well, and the beer was cold!
