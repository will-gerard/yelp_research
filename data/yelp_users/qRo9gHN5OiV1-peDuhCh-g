Just when it seemed like I couldn't be impressed by a Mexican restaurant anymore, here comes Comedor Guadalajara. When so many others stopped offering free chips and salsa while you wait I was SHOCKED by not only getting chips and salsa but a cup of soup while waiting for our meal. We went in for lunch, and while we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table, the service was awesome and we were in and out quickly. They do not mess around here and I was thoroughly impressed. The food was close to the Tex Mex that I crave from home and the value for the money is solid. The chili rellanos was killer. Will be back regularly!

I lived in the neighborhood for a good year before trying this place. Shame on me! This is mom and pop at it's finest. Great portions of high quality meat and yummy breads. Price is such a good deal for what you get and it's always super fast service. My man and I usually split one sandwich and side and are happy full when done. I love the selection of Boar's Head meats as well as I can't find them at the Fry's down the street.

Been back a handful of times since I wrote this and felt I should update. Service has improved and it seems that they've updated their menu so that the spinach dip's description more accurately matches what actually is served. Not positive, because I haven't had the balls to order it. I found another gem on the menu called the parmesan fries. Holy lord! Very good. The wings were also solid. Still no hefe on tap- hopefully they'll bring back that gold goodness soon. Hint hint!

The food was great but the service left a bad taste in our mouths.   First of all, I'm no diva and do my best to be nice to people and not sweat the small stuff. I've been a manager and know how tough this kind of work can be. That said the experience here was pretty awkward and uncomfortable.   Upon arriving and not seeing a huge crowd, we were told that it would be an hour and fifteen minute wait. We said ok, we'd like to check the bar. She rudely told us that it was full and gave my fiance the stink eye when he left. I trusted her and waited for him to come back. While I was waiting I overheard a surly exchange between the hostess and customer.   "What's the difference between this bar and the one inside?" Answer: "This one is outside and that one is inside" Seeing the realization on her face that she was being rude, she "politely" added that the one outside had a different bartender too.  "What time do you close?" Answer: Basically a lot of complaining about customers coming in late which was code for "I hate staying late". Really not cool. Really bad for business.   Anywho... seeing as my fiance wasn't back I guessed correctly that he scored us some bar seats. And there were two more down a ways. Full my ass. It was like she was trying to turn away business so she could leave early. It was only 8pm too!  Enter bartender... or ID Nazi. My fiance is 33 and rarely, if ever carded. No biggie, but the guy was kind of abrupt and not friendly. He then had a really awkward interaction with a girl that worked there. He was reprimanding her but did it in a very rude way. Not what I want to see.   It took forever for us to put in our order and after we got our food and another employee came to sit down next to us we got the full brunt of bad juju at the restaurant. Apparently they've fired two managers recently and are going to clean house some more.   Seriously. Keep your business inside your back room. I don't want to hear about it while I'm trying to relax. Customer service here needs a kick in the pants!  PS: Tell your people to stop yelling at customers on the way out to "have a great night, thanks" because it is so insincere that it is worse than saying nothing at all.

Ordered out here today and was very pleased with the food. I got the Iron Pot (Nabeykai Udon) and it was tasty although I would have liked more vegetables. It had TONS of seafood.   The pot stickers were yummy. Perfect flavor and perfectly cooked.   How'd I not know about this place?! I can't wait to try it again!

I love Scott's. Pure and simple. This place is a gem from top to bottom. I've been coming here for over a year and food and service is always fast, friendly, and delish.   The bagels are awesome- try the egg bagel. I used to come in every Thursday and eat a bagel, drink tons of coffee, and read the New Times. The waitresses were always very sweet to me and I felt right at home. I also love how they don't scrimp on the cream cheese.  The fiance and I usually have breakfast here and could easily share a plate because it is SO MUCH FOOD! The sandwiches look amazing (again... SO MUCH FOOD!) and the deserts look fantastic.   Try the latkes and the breakfast sandwich with challa bread. It'll make you wanna holla!   ...See what I did there?

I've been going to Ethan for about a two years and the level of service on my past two visits has made me decide to look elsewhere. I just can't justify spending $150+ for someone to continually walk away and be rough with my coconut. The last time I went I specifically asked the appt setter if I would have enough time booking the appt two and a half hours before I needed to be somewhere (that was the only appt available). Well, I was late. It took 2 hours and 45 minutes to cut and color my hair. He may be brilliant but walking away three times just while blow drying my hair is not ok. Not listening to me regarding what I wanted for color is not ok. Granted, it looks fine, but he's definitely done better and I'm so upset about the experience that he lost my business.

I had the unfortunate task of helping a friend choose her wedding desserts from this bakery. HA! Unfortunate my tush!! Barb's knows cupcakes, ya'll. The cosmo cupcake is heavenly. I would pay my first born for that recipe! Ok, not really, but you get the idea.   Said friend decided on the mini desserts of cheesecake, tiramisu, and chocolate mousse. At my table there was lively debate over which was the best, but sadly, no votes for the cheesecake. The mouse and tiramisu were phenomenal. My vote was for the tiramisu. Seriously. I could've used some alone time with it.

I love the food and coffee here (although I would double dog dare anyone to actually commute anywhere while trying to eat the commuter breakfast sandwich). Long lines? I can deal with those. But for food/coffee this expensive why... WHY are there tip jars out? Please explain to me why I need to tip... for someone to call out my name? Really? Are you not paying your employees enough? It's ridiculous. I hate tip jars. But the service is always good so I feel like a jerk for not tipping, which results in fewer visits here. Seriously, your price+tip=way too much for what you get.  Also, what's up with the disappearance of the small yogurt granola? It's not on the menu and missing from the refrigerated case the last couple of times I've been in there. Boo.

How on Earth I completely missed this place is beyond me. I swear I thought the closest one to Uptown was on Bell. Doh!   Had a wonderful dinner here last night with my man. We had Moretti Rossa just like we were in Italy last year, which was nostalgic and fun. Then we shared the mixed salad which was nice. I swear if I had a bigger purse I would've swiped the cute balsamic/olive oil holder. I mean, allegedly. We then had the Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach which was super good. It's probably a good thing we live outside their delivery area. Too bad, guess we'll just have to come back!

Visit date 3/24/11:  I was really impressed with our visit. We brought our friends from France and the waitress was really accommodating with our goal of ordering lots to share family style. She even suggested their veggie tamale that was really good. I can't wait to go back and have another. My only qualm? A tiny bit too much cheese drenched on top. I know, I know... anyone who knows me knows I love me some cheese. But the food is so good that it doesn't need to hide under all that cheese!

Just found my favorite spa in the valley! Had a scrub and facial with Ranee yesterday and it was heaven! I literally fell asleep for a little bit while the mask was on. This facial was the best I've ever had and I cannot recommend Ranee enough! Serious pampering and my skin feels awesome. The products they use at the spa are great- I usually prefer Aveda products but these were really nice. I did not leave feeling gooey at all. I can't wait to go back and thankfully their prices are reasonable, so I can return sooner rather than later!

I love the feel of this place. Very cool vibe. It's truly a hidden gem. If you don't know about it, you'd drive right by. It faces 15th Ave and parking is in the back. Just be prepared to drive around the block to find it and you won't be sorry you did. It's worth it!   Let's talk meat. Nice thick slices of meat. They don't skimp round here, y'all and me likee. My fiance and I shared the Super Sicilian and it was enough for both of us plus a side of potato salad, chips, and a green salad. The potato salad is good- nothing fancy just simple yummy goodness. The toasted sesame seed buns are heavenly.The simple salad is a little skimpy for the price tag, it could use some darker leafy goodness or some jazz. But I don't mess around with the salad. I want thick delicious meat and potatoes. That's right. I wear the pants.   Bonus points for serving beer here. Double bonus for serving Moretti instead of Peroni.

I've been going here for a couple of years now and always get great service and quality. The price is reasonable (although I'd love to get some coupons!) and the turnaround is fabulous.   My only qualm is that when I got home with my very nice, strapless cocktail dress it was attached to the hanger with metal spikes and nothing in between for protective cushion. I kid you not. I can't for the life of me understand why someone would do that to a silk dress. It left little holes and screwed up the stitching a bit, but not too badly. I didn't notice until I got home and I was FUMING. Had I gotten off my lazy butt and taken it back, I'm they would've handled it- they really are wonderful. At that point there's nothing they could've done to fix the dress. But I hope they read this and ream out whoever used those spiky thingies on nice dresses. NO! BAD!!  Anywho. Great cleaners. Just watch out for spikes.

Apparently I'm too nice. I wrote in my last review after they drove spikes into my nice silk strapless dress that I was sure they would've taken care of it, had I gotten off my lazy ass, because they really are wonderful folks.   Wrong. WRONG!!!  I am too nice. Period. I brought in a pair of pants that I had altered recently... taken in at the waist and replaced back buttons for a mere $23 Oh, I should mention the back buttons were missing due to Regal cleaners services. Did I ever complain then? Nope. Should I have? Yup.  Upon getting these pants back, they were missing a button and had weird white stuff on them. I figured they would take care of it. I took the pants in, explained that I had just had them altered (great work at The Fit Alterations, BTW) and now they were damaged. The manager was out and I waited on the call back.   I miss the call and stopped by that night only to be told that the white stuff was the fabric wearing out and that was from normal wear and tear. Um, ok. They weren't like that at all when I brought them in and now they are almost unwearable (especially because of the button flap sticking out on the ass of the pants because you took it off... yet AGAIN).  No offer was made to put the button back on... no offer of returning my money for the last cleaning of said pants. Nothing. If they'd sewn the button back on, at least I could've worn them one last time. Yes, I am that cheap, I would've worn them even with the white junk all over. Now, they are trash. Expensive trash. It's just weird that they went from fine to completely unwearable in one single visit to the cleaners.   And that was the day that Regal lost my family's business.

Yummy in my tummy goes the won-ton soup. It is my go to for when anyone is feeling sick and totally hits the spot with all its veggies. Best in the valley, IMHO. The fried rice is also really yummy here. They don't skimp on the veggies which I love.   Last visit to eat in was a couple weeks ago and the waitress/owner(?) was super nice to us and our French friends visiting from across the pond. I will definitely make an effort to eat in more often instead of ordering out.

Want to walk up and play a cheap game or two of tennis? This is your place. If you've got your own gear it's less than a couple bucks for an hour of play. Not too shabby for nice courts.

Best cheese curds and onion rings in town, and the burgers are really, really good. Not sure about this surly waitress everyone mentions, but we usually belly up to the bar and have great service.   Seriously, do not even think about not ordering one of the above mentioned appetizers. They are that good.

Oh no! Where did my Wineburger go?!? I wrote the review based on a hungry tummy and fond memories. Today I went in and it's just not the same. Something happened on January 1st, 2011 because their burgers are different -and bigger does NOT mean better! The flavor was completely missing and the beef was dry. They also do not have cheese pints (curds) any longer. Some distributer issue. BOO!! Also the price seems to be higher.   Fail, Wineburger. FAIL.  The one plus? The service was great. Will I go back? Nope.

You MUST try this place. It is wonderful! We shared the zeljanica (spinach spankopita thingy) and the sausage sandwich. Both were amazing. We also had turkish coffee... it blew my mind. I was so pleased by the way it was served. THAT'S how it should be done! I keep meaning to get back soon and savor another turkish coffee and a zeljanica all by myself. Because I don't want to have to share!

Best brewery in Arizona. Period. End of story.   Great bar food, absolutely awesome beers. My favorites are the oatmeal stout (my winter time pick), SunBru (summer time), and Kiltlifter (year round), and hefeweizen (year round). On the food side, the chicken rolls are my favorite.  Don't miss out on this gem. Beer is supposed to have flavor! Put the beer flavored water down and get to Four Peaks!!

I was in the neighborhood and craving some healthy food...thank goodness I spy Pita Jungle. We shared the Spanakopita and while it's not a lot- it is under $4. My favorite was the feta cube that was served with it. YUM. Best feta... I want to buy it in bulk it's so light and delicious. We then shared the chicken shawarma  which was perfect and the grilled vegetable side which was a little too peppery- but still very good. It was a very satisfying and filling meal and great for keeping up my energy for the rest of the day. Weee!!!

Visit date 3/21/11:  So this is my fiance's favorite restaurant (ie: "the best meal I've ever had")  and we were there with our friends from France. One of whom is a chef. So I was hoping this would live up to his claims. We all were going to go for the prixe fix menu until we noticed that it may be cheaper to go a la carte. I was the only one who strayed and did three appetizers. I was going to get the scallops as a main but there was a special of scallops offered as an app and I was already afraid of having too much food. Looks like I was right because even ordering three starters overfilled me. Not a happy stuffed, but an uncomfortable stuffed. The little freebie desserts weren't even touched and went straight into a box for our table. We were all overfed and would've preferred smaller portions.   For the food: Overall very nice but my scallop appetizer was a miss. It was too sweet with the sweet potatoes and not a good flavor pairing. The parmesan souffle was to die for. I ordered the mixed baby greens but was brought a different salad that was delicious, so no hard feelings. It had shallots that were so good I made everyone at the table try a bite (must re-create at home!). Fiance got the veal porterhouse and it was amazing. Perfectly cooked. The desserts that others ordered were passed around but everyone could only manage a bite or two being so full from the previous two courses. I wasn't too impressed with the desserts. Nothing memorable.   The two dings against the restaurant... Our friends pointed out a couple of errors with the French that was written on menu/labels. I hope they get that fixed! The second was a lady's night where girls eat half off/ free. I thought our waitress was talking about something on the strip until I realized it was for this restaurant. Kinda left a bad taste in my mouth... why cheapen your fine establishment with... ladies night? Weird.   Would I return? Absolutely. I would just order two courses though.

I can't believe I've failed to review this place! In fact, I'm not sure why I don't go more often. Had a nice lunch today, the burger at medium rare was super juicy and the fries were solid. I had a really nice bloody mary and the $3 price tag was nice. I want to stray away from the burgers and try some sandwiches next time... plus the wall o' draft beers is drool inducing.

This is hands down the best pizza in the valley. I lived in Rome for a month and the pizza at Cibo was better than most I had there. The wine selection here is also amazing- you can tell they really care about their selections. I just love how authentic this place is. Tutto bene!   Seriously, I'd get married here if I could.

I love Matt's. I hate the wait. But if you have the patience, it's worth it. Really yummy hash browns, waffles, and I am never disappointed with their specials. Irenia is super nice and remembers her regulars which makes it feel less like a conveyer belt of customers.

Had breakfast here the last two mornings and both meals were very good. First day I got the Florentine benedict and it had great flavors. I really liked the red pepper sauce and the hash browns were yummy. They had some extra herbage in them- but I couldn't quite pick it out. Hubby had the yogurt granola that was really good. The yogurt had lemon in it and the granola was super high quality. This morning I had the special which was a cheddar biscuit sliders with egg and sausage. I could only finish one and hubs had clean up duty. He was not upset by this.

Solid sports bar! Went here for the women's world cup finals and had a great time. Bloody mary's were awesome and the appetizers were a nice surprise. The jalapeno poppers were yummy and the sliders were nice too. Service was great and I'll definitely be back...they've got Murphy's on tap!!

Finally. Finally!!! A solid British pub. Service was great (more than I can say for some actual pubs in London) and food was absoflippinlutely stellar. We shared the Shepard's Pie, Bangers and Mash, and the broccoli cauliflower cheese bake (yes, there were leftovers). It was impossible to pick a favorite and this will definitely be on my go-to list when in Tempe. The beer list is superb and I had a hard time choosing as there were so many of my favorites from overseas travel. My only wish? Murphy's on tap.

Superb beer selection. Music was really nice and at a good volume. Really a great place to hang out and have a drink. We missed (aka were too tired to stay up past our bedtime) a jazz jam session. Will have to grab a coffee and hang out next time because I miss me some good jazz. It's so hard to find in Phoenix!

I've been here twice and I can assure you it will not be my last time. Had lunch today and it was yummy and the service was particularly nice. I got the gyro and lentil soup and the fiance got the chicken shawarma, lentil soup, and a side salad (the Fattoosh salad). It was all really good but I think the chicken shawarma was the winner. The lentil soup is also amazing with a bit of squeezed lemon and pepper. I could eat it all day long. Also, the prices can't be beat. Super duper deal.

This is a fantastic pharmacy and I have never had anything less than stellar experiences here. They really go out of their way to make sure the patient gets taken care of... gotta love that. When I lost my insurance they got me a lowered rate for my birth control. When my fiance got a really nasty case of poison ivy, they let me take care of the entire transaction while he lay in an oatmealy tub.   They rock and I feel lucky to have them in the neighborhood!

Went here for post dinner drinks last night. I've eaten here before and really enjoyed it (but it's been so long ago I won't base the review on that).   The drinks here are really nice and unique. Great ambiance and I love the Julia Child video. The cucumber drink is yummy. I had total order envy because it was so light and refreshing.

Got take-out from here last night and it was HORRIBLE! Something must have happened because they only had 3 people working and were VERY disorganized. Should have checked the food before we left! Ordered fajitas and there was very little meat... it was beyond ridiculous. Hardly any peppers but a plethora of what looked like stewed tomatoes. Look... I'm a gringa and I know that don't look right and I could do a way better job. The rice was missing completely and there was only one giant pizza pie looking tortilla. We called and the person who answered could barely speak English (which is really not a big deal in my book) but there was no manager around to resolve the situation. We asked for an email so we could send a note about the experience but she was unhelpful. All she offered was for us to come back right then...which if you were as hungry as my fiance was not an option. He gets grumpy and I know better than mess with a grumpy-hungry-pants.

Love me some Hana. Seriously great quality sushi and BYOB. It doesn't get better than that. Period. The service has always been great for us and they do a great job explaining what's freshest and new to try. It's so neat that it's in our neighborhood and we can wander on over with a bottle of wine and stumble on home with full, happy bellies.

Enjoyed the bruschetta, halibut cakes, and the ravioli and loved every bite. Also had two wine flights that were nice. $75 for all of that not too bad. There were 3 pieces each of the bruschetta which is smaller than other places, but I actually like their bread better.   The sad part was that we were the only people in there on a Saturday afternoon. Poor DC Ranch. These businesses have to be hurting. I hope they last because I'd love to come back!

I've had lunch here twice and have really enjoyed the food. My first visit I got the rimpolla sandwich and it was tasty (and enough to bring half home for later). Yesterday I had the penne alla vodka and it was good. Nice and spicy which I wasn't quite expecting. But me likee. I also tasted the rigatoni alla fiorentina and it was light and creamy. The fiance added a meatball and it was yummy.   I'll be back but I wish they served wine. What... it's a lunch only spot? ....Oh. Well... I'd still like some wine. It' not like it's illegal to have wine with lunch! :p

Great pub where the food is not at all an afterthought. On the first visit, we took advantage of the check-in deal and got the mussels with the shepherd's pie and fish and chips. All were outstanding. The bartender also offered some sauce that complemented the shepherd's pie which was a thoughtful gesture. The thing I loved about the pie was that it wasn't covered in cheese and that everything was well balanced. My husband got the fish and chips and gave me a bite but wasn't all that open to sharing, so I'll have to order my own next time.   The second time we went we took advantage of the happy hour special and got a bunch of apps including the mussels again, crab cakes, wings, and cod sliders. I really enjoyed the cod sliders. The bread was light and crunchy, the cole slaw topping was fresh and the fish was perfectly battered. Such a great combo. The crab cakes were really fresh and the wasabi sauce was a nice compliment. The wings were good- as you'd expect for pub fare. The mussels again were yummy with the spicy broth perfect to dip the homemade bread in. We found out they'll sell the bread by the loaf, so I'll have to do that for a special occasion.

Had dinner there last night and it was a really good experience. Chill but good service and yummy pizza. We got meatball, green peppers, and onions. The green peppers were really fresh and still had a little crunch to them which I loved. We ordered a small pie cause we wanted beers (no YOU'RE an alcoholic!), but the 2 pieces with a soda deal is truly a steal and I'll probably get that one next time. Unless, of course, I need a beer.

I've been twice and have been very impressed both times. The sushi is very fresh and I really appreciate how the rolls are cut. This sounds weird, right? Stay with me. Usually I feel like I'm going to choke on a piece of sushi because it is so large and I don't really enjoy the flavors as much as I would if the pieces were manageable. Alright... go ahead with the "that's what she said" joke. This review is asking for it.   But this restaurant is fast becoming my favorite for sushi. The service I have experienced has always been top notch.   Can't wait to go back for Sushi Tuesdays!

We ordered the calamari appetizer and the field greens salad. The calamari was ok and it was nice to have two different dipping sauces. The field greens salad was good. I ordered the gnocci and my fiance ordered the linguini in clam sauce. The gnocci was ok, it was very buttery. The linguini pasta was cooked well but the sauce was gross. Like cat food gross. It did not look or taste homemade at all. Very disappointing and as you can tell by the picture there was a lot left. This is odd because my fiance is a garbage disposal. Everyone who knows him knows this, but he did not finish this plate.   The worst? I woke up at midnight very nauseous and threw up.   Thanks Il Posto.

My ball and chain has been training for a half marathon and therefore, I have been suffering the onslaught of veggies and non-fried fare. So let's just say I wasn't thrilled at his choice for lunch.   And then I ate my words. And my veg.   We started with the summer rolls and they were yummy. I didn't miss the meat at all. The peanut dipping sauce was tasty, although a little thick... which was actually nice. I had the Pad Thai as an entree and the salad that came with it was super fresh and tasty. I usually like my salad served with a side of lettuce and enough other junk to qualify it as not so healthy (hello, blue cheese!). This salad was good and it didn't leave me missing anything. The Pad Thai wasn't as spicy as I usually like, but the broccoli on top made up for it. Ryan had the Chicken and veg. Well, the SOY chicken and veg. I couldn't help but crack a joke about what I like to have when I'm craving some chicken.... actual chicken. I have to admit the soy chicken was good and the texture was stellar. His had more spice and was super tasty.   Top it off with a hot cup of Jasmine tea and I was happy.   We'll definitely be back.

Maizie's has been a favorite of mine for nearly two years now and I can't believe I'm just getting around to writing a review. Bad Cookie.   My fiance and I hit up Monday night burgers just about every Monday. We try to wrangle friends out sometimes, but it can be hard when having kids tend to suck them into the vortex of... well... wherever they go. That's fiiiiine, really, cause we just belly up to the bar and meet new peeps and hang with the kick ass bartender Tina.   The burgers are always quick and very tasty. I've started getting the sweet potato fries and they rock. Perfect crunchy on the outside/soft inside. The ciabatta bread the burgers come on is fantastic.   Also noteworthy at Maizie's are the pizzas. Yum. They have a Tuesday special that I wish was on another night because I feel a little weird hitting them up two nights in a row. I don't want to be those people, ya know? The brunch is also fantastic. I just love this place and haven't had a bad meal or bad service here. Ever.   Last, I love how dog friendly this place is. We often bring the pooch and she is always treated like the pretty princess she is. They give her a bowl of water and a cheeto looking treat she loves.

Great price and even better work! I will definitely use George again to clean my chair. It's a tricky microfiber suede thing from Crate and Barrel and I was really worried it couldn't be cleaned. It looks amazing now and I am so glad I found this company!

Had lunch here a couple days ago and I really liked the sammies. Hubs had the T.J. and I had order envy! I really liked my Italian Hero and would order it again, but might bargain for a half sammie switcheroo because the T.J. was really good. We did the Yelp deal and I got the fruit salad and he got a side salad. Both were very good. Service was very friendly and helpful and I will definitely be back.

This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Phoenix. This is where we go to celebrate and to enjoy a night out with amazing food and great service. Noca is an experience. I wouldn't recommend trying to quickly hit up a meal here before trying to catch a movie. I can't imagine trying to rush the experience!  On our most recent visit I immediately ordered my favorite cocktail- the Dirty Bird. It's so perfectly crafted and smooth...plus there are bleu cheese stuffed olives. Sold! I felt a little bad because my fiance wanted to celebrate our new jobby-jobs with prosecco... my bad. Lay off me when there's bleu cheese stuffed olives and vodka involved mister!  First up was the mixed salad. I love how it's not overloaded with cheese and candied fruit. It's the perfect balance of flavors.   We then had the lobster roll and it was absolutely heavenly. I really hated to share that but I needed to save room for the scallops. The scallops were so perfectly cooked and the plating was gorgeous. The flavors were outstanding- absolutely sublime. Ryan actually asked me if I remembered his name. I just smiled.

This place has the most AMAZING selection of cheeses. EVER. Boyfriend got me a tasting selection of about five different cheeses for my birthday last year and I was in heaven. Truly amazing variety and all were super yummy.

Visit date 3/22/11  Now this is what a coffee shop is supposed to be! Amazing hand pulled espresso with a crema so perfect you didn't need any sugar. Awesome drip coffee too, although once I tasted the espresso, I had extreme order envy. Oh well, when I return to Lost Wages I will definitely hit this place up again for an espresso. The only thing missing was a selection of breakfast pastries. If they'd been out I would've gotten one as I was starved.

Love the saki selection here! The ribs with red curry were really yummy. The wontons with chicken and cheese were ok, the dipping sauces made all the difference. The shrimp dish labeled spicy was extremely spicy and nice with a side of rice as was recommended... although I still wanted a glass of milk to put out the fire in my mouth.   We went on Christmas eve and I have to say that with things pretty slow in there I had the chance to look around... really look around. They need to dust. I'm not saying I Joan Crawford'ed it around with a white glove or anything, but above our head (and our food) the lotus flowers had giant dust bunnies on them. I started looking around at other fixtures and it looks like they haven't dusted since they opened the place. Gross. For the price of those dishes you think you could buy a dust buster!

Wowza. This place is G-double O- GOOD. We were with another couple and decided to share everything and I'm so happy we did because I wanted to taste EVERYTHING. We started with the Mac & Cheese (of course we added lobster, cause when they spell it lobstah...you kinda have to), the dates, and the fries/gravy. All stellar. I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy the dates were. For mains we got the chicken and waffles and skirt steak. Both very good but we were all getting pretty full at this point. The chicken was seriously good. Great flavor and we the one breast was absolutely perfectly cooked. I literally just used my fork and it was like butter. The fiance also found his new favorite beer and the manager spent some time explaining the label and the history of it which was really cool. The cookie balls at the end were really yummy too. Who doesn't like balls?!

We got some coupons for hot dogs/pizza here after riding on the roller coaster at NY NY (key word: after). Bad idea. The pizza was gross and the hot dog was just ok. The service was horrendous. Seriously... why does it take 20 minutes to get a pre-made slice of pizza and already cooked hot dog?! Do they assume everyone is drunk and won't notice? Seriously, don't bother. It's not even that cheap.

I used to come here on Tuesday's for grad school after I got tired of the neighboring meal options. I always got a chicken quesadilla and on two different occasions I had bone in my quesadilla. The first was more annoying that harmful, but the second time I was absolutely awestruck. How do you not notice a chicken bone that size? It was also sharp and I feel lucky that I was not hurt. See my picture and you'll understand why I have never been back.

We put our name on the long list for Matt's Big Breakfast and headed out to get a cup of coffee. The coffee shop at the grocery store across the street was closed on Sunday so we ended up here. The coffee was great and the menu for breakfast looked good, plus I was starved.   I am so glad we stumbled on this place! We got the Irish Fry Breakfast and a side of pancakes. It was spot on. Having had an actual fry breakfast in Ireland this really was good. The black and white pudding was stellar and I wanted more. The soda bread was yummy and the pancakes were really solid. The meats were really good and everything was perfectly cooked.   Was I upset that we missed out on Matt's? Not really. I would definitely choose this place over Matt's again. I don't feel guilty (even though I know we'd hurt Irenia's feelings) because when we walked back by our name was still yet to be called and the same tourists were waiting outside.   Suckers.

Had dinner here recently and already can't wait to go back. We had the guacamole and queso with chorizo and both were good. I usually love the guacamole but tonight  (it was last Thursday) it was a little too chunky. It was also missing the usual tang from the fruit. It was still great, but I've had better (yes, that's what she said).   We then ordered an assortment of tacos which were all delicious. My favorite was the pork and I am literally salivating at the thought of them. The were perfect with just a hint of sweet. Pure heaven! Plus the margaritas were spot on and the service was friendly.

Went here last night and had a great time. The wait was super long but we were lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar. Our group ordered the calimari and brushetta to start and it was good. The brushetta was a little overloaded and dripped everywhere on me... but that's because I am a spaz when I eat. For pizza we shared the sausage, bbq chicken, and the yukon gold. The bbq chicken was very good, but I was taken aback by how hot the jalapenos were. I had to pick them off, lest they burn me twice. The sausage pizza was very nice and I'd order it again. The yukon gold pizza (with leeks, pancetta, and gorgonzola) was not a hit at our table. Out of the 5 of us, I was the only one that really liked it. Oh well... I got leftovers suckas!

Really enjoyed lunch here. I got #26, egg noodle soup with pork wontons, shrimp, squid, etc. He got the pho beef soup (not sure of the number) and we shared the shrimp spring rolls. Seriously delicious and great value.   I ordered out another night and got #31 and was pretty happy I got this one to eat at home it was delicious but I made a mess of myself. Clean up on aisle Cookie!  Can't wait until winter... I can see myself eating here once a week!

Just returned from a Sunday afternoon of bloody mary's, wings, fries, and football. The holy trinity. Oops, I guess I'm a little over three things needed for a trinity. Oh well. Needless to say I wasn't rooting for Tebow!   The wings here are amazing. We ordered them medium honey BBQ and they could have been a touch hotter for my taste, but I wasn't complaining. The crispiness of the skin was perfect. We ordered a dozen but filled up with 5 wounded soldiers still on the plate. These wings weren't skimpy, y'all.   The service was awesome and the TVs were perfectly spaced out for prime viewing.   Now if you'll excuse me I need a nap.   Did I mention the Bloody Mary bar? With blue cheese stuffed olives? No, well you might see me there next Sunday.

Solid cocktails here and happy hour eats are quite tasty. I had the Mai Tai and the Orange Martini which were both fantastic. We had the shrimp rolls, pork tacos, and fries. The shrimps rolls were a "stop what you are doing and get you some" kind of dish... complete with air quotes if I saw you in person. They were phenomenal. I will be back... soon. Hold on to your butts.

Had a great meal here last night. No issues with slow service, although we were there for a fairly late dinner. Service was good and the food was yummy. We had the mixed tempura app, one other delicious one I can't remember, the Volcano, Mexican, and Vegas rolls plus the Deluxe Sashimi. Quality of the sashimi was good and I really liked the rolls. Who doesn't like cream cheese in their rolls?   It seems to me like they were aware of prior reviews commenting on service. At one point we were double teamed by two waiters who could've communicated with each other a little better so we didn't have to answer the same question twice, but no biggie, they were just trying to make sure we were taken care of.   My only complaint would be that the rolls were really big- definitely a two biter. It made the volcano a little difficult to eat, but delicious nonetheless. If we're up that way again, I'd definitely return.

Holy junk! I am a fan of this place. On our second trip here I tried to branch out and order some different things. We got the TMI toast (yum... and almost too much food for a starter), the mac and cheese (praise Jebus) and the BLT (you can't find that thick cut bacon anywhere.... yes.... that's what she said).   Service was great and we had a great bottle of red (Paso Robles something).   We'll be back fo sho.

You know what stinks about moving? Having to find new EVERYTHING. Dentist, Dry Cleaner, Woo-ha Doctor. It's a pain. Thank goodness for Yelp because it has made my move to Phoenix all the better.   My experience with The Fit was FANTASTIC! I highly recommend them for professional, quick, affordable work. I took in 4 pairs of pants, a skirt, and two shirts for some fixin up. Boy did they. I can't believe how long I have been putting this off!   I've got another stack that need taken in and I am looking forward to going back. The guys are really nice and their work looks great.   Seriously. GO. Stop procrastinating.

Absolutely fantastic. I could close my eyes and I was back in Rome enjoying a Margherita. It surely helped that I could actually hear Italian being spoken when I closed my eyes.   In addition to the Margherita we had the Pomo, the Crocchette Pugliesi and the Mista salad. The crocchette was just like I've had at a street fair but I was a little jealous that they were out of the Arancini, which are my favorite treat. Too bad, but I will be back and next time I will save room for dessert.

Getting married at Regale! very soon and I have to share what a wonderful experience it has been so far. I could not have wished for better people to work with; Tony and Linda are top notch. They have done an awesome job putting us at ease. Planning has been very organized and they have given great suggestions and are always very prompt to answer any questions we have. I would highly recommend working with them.   The venue itself is gorgeous and is a really nice blank slate to work with- the details in the room are well thought out and put together. It's also the perfect size so that even a small wedding won't feel swallowed up by a giant room. I kind of felt like Goldilocks- it was just right. It is very clean and has great light- can't wait to see how well the photos turn out.

After a nice first visit about 3 weeks ago, I trek over from CenPho to Ken's in Arcadia to get a pedicure. I am looking forward to getting the knot out of my shoulder after a long first week of teaching.    It was an a-ok pedicure. The results look nice. The ripoff at the end, however, ruined what was supposed to be a relaxing pampering session. Around 1:30-ish today when she walked me up front she mumbled a price. I handed her my ASU grad student ID (opting to use that instead of the yelp check in) and she didn't realize it was an ID and tried to swipe it. After getting that cleared up she said "$24"... hmm... ok. I had handed her $23 because that's about how much I remember it being last time with tip. I asked "after the discount"? She said $24 again. So I handed her $26 and picked up a brochure on my way out.   Sure enough, a regular spa pedicure is $22. I walk back inside and talk to the nice lady who greeted me when I initially walked in. I told her I just got ripped off. I was nice about it. Maybe my tech was confused about the discount... or something. But then she came back (of course my tech is now hiding in the back) and said the tech got confused and thought I was the other customer she had that got a callous treatment. Um...no. I did not get a callous treatment. I said I will take back everything over the $22 I handed her ($4).   I got that back, but was reeling in the car. I swore I had a $5 in my wallet. Had I been that stupid (read: exhausted) to get doubly ripped off and get the old switcheroo? I don't know. But it doesn't feel right.   I wish I would have taken back everything over the $20 that the pedi should have cost. Why I even gave her the $2 tip is beyond me. Apparently I should have asked if they could have written 'door mat' on my forehead.   I will not be returning to Ken's. I will advise my friends to do the same.

This place was fan-flippin-tabulous. I can't believe we haven't been here before...maybe it was the big Roman dude out front.   It was the usual Saturday night debate on where to go. Chow for the salad? Too far. Dick's? Too much greasy cheese. Then I remembered hearing great things about Centurion (mainly about their pizzas). Of course, we had decided to have pizza the night before and weren't in the mood for more pizza. Oops. Oh well, let's give them a shot.   The wine list was nicely thought out, it's so refreshing to have someone choosing wines that they have a passion for. It definitely shows and we got a great wine from Alsace. I'll definitely hunt down more for the house.  We got the seasonal salad with cous cous, salami, spinach, tomato and lemony dressing. This salad was absolutely perfect for summer... and beyond. Seriously... it gives Cowboy Chow's salad a run for its money.   Next we got the mushroom risotto and the gnocchi with shitake dijon cream sauce. The gnocchi was seriously good...lick your plate good.   I am so glad I remembered to mention them! We had leftovers and I can guarantee someone at our house just might lose a finger. Just saying.

This place is the bomb. Yup, I said it. I ordered 3 barbacoa and 3 carne asada and they were both delicious. The onions and peppers were such an awesome treat to go with the tacos and at $1 each, such a sweet deal. The guacamole sauce was also really nice. Why are you still reading? Go! Nuff said!!

Had lunch here today and it was pretty good. I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and chips and it was solid. Nothing that overly wowed me. The chips had a good flavor... just a little overdone. Service was good but the refill on ice tea was slow. No biggie, I wasn't dying of thirst.  I was torn and almost gave it 4 stars, but overall it was just A-OK. That said, I will return.  URG! Edit to up it to a 4 star review. I just couldn't leave it at a 3. It deserves a 4. For real. Bad Cookie.

Although I was very happy with my hair and pretty pleased with my makeup, the overall experience here was a miss. I was part of a bridal party that was going to get glammed up at the salon prior to the big event last weekend. That Friday (yup, the day before) they called and told us we had to be there at 8:30am instead of the agreed upon 10am. Not cool. Upon arriving at 8:30 (ok... 8:37) I saw there were two of our party waiting and 4 girls who worked there getting ready themselves. The makeup artists were literally putting on their own makeup and no one made an effort to say hello to me when I walked in. Whatevs. After about 5 minutes they got started on two of the girls hair. I just sat around and waited some more. Seriously...why did I need to be here at 8:30?  You can see how this is going. They did not have the people there dedicated to our group as promised. The bride was not treated as she should have been (and she was NO bridezilla, ya'll). She wasn't happy with her hair and the girl that did the trial had to leave for another wedding. Not cool. Because they were down people/lacked organization we were WAY behind schedule and it was freaking the bride out over time (we even had two girls drop out and not get services so they were lucky there). I am getting married soon and although I loved my hair, I wouldn't go there again. It isn't worth the stress.

I feel the need to update after the owner posted a comment. The comment is more of an advertisement than a mea culpa. The changes that took place were not on our end. They were initiated by Park Ave for whatever reason.... and they didn't end up making the experience any better. I think there are some lessons to be learned in customer service here (did they ever reach out to the bride? No).   In addition to that, they need to stop using Yelp as an advertising tool and focus on delivering great services and customer experience inside their four walls. I don't think I've ever seen so many obviously bogus reviews trying to 'up' the star rating. Seriously... look at the filtered reviews. Such a shame as it could be a really cool place.   Fail, Park Ave, fail. This left a worse taste in my mouth than before.

Had dinner here after Oktoberfest shenanigans and this place really hit the spot. The service was good and the pizza was fantastic. I love the potato one (don't remember the name) and the crust on the simple pepperoni was stellar. The thai pizza was good, but had a tad too much of the sweet sauce. It's the only one that wasn't wiped clean, which usually happens with that one.   I can't wait for some more of that potato pie... plus they've got the Four Peaks Pumpkin Stout on draft. Holla!

We had the Windsor burger which was perfectly cooked, juicy and plenty of flavor. The fiance complained that the caramelized onions were too sweet, but I found it dee-vine. The mac and cheese was also tasty and I loved the crispy topping. We also got a side of veg which was spinach and I wish we had ordered two. It was yummy. Their winter ale on tap (forget the exact name) was surprisingly good.   This place is fantastic...except for one thing. It's a teensy bit over priced. Just a buck or two on each item overpriced. I'm going to need to find the email/text/yelp deals in order to return as much as I might like...or I could just take up extreme couponing so I can go there every week.

So we've been back about three more times because I've developed a wings addiction that is bordering on troublesome. Seriously, I might need an intervention. The wings continue to be *delicious*... although we've started to notice we aren't getting 12 in a basket. Last time it was 10. The size hasn't increased... hmmm...  The increased star is for the fries. It is no secret that the fries at Zipps are not the best. (See this talk thread: http://www.yelp.com/topic/gilbert-now-that-the-lockout-is-over-lets-talk-sports-bars) The flavor is good, but they are always soggy and limp. This Sunday (7/24/11 at 8pm) they were AWESOME! Crisp, firm, and soft on the inside! It was shocking, I tell you! SHOCKING!   Can you please do this more often? This should be the standard, not the exception.

Over this place. OVER. I've had too many ups and downs but today was the straw that broke the camel's back. We came in and there was a wait. We waited for about 15 minutes and noticed that there were 4 single guys each taking up a booth- by themselves- in the bar. It was almost comical watching them nurse their beers and play on their phones. While we were waiting on a table so we could get our hangover grub on, we noticed that there were two empty tables (4 tops). Not sure how long they'd been sitting empty, but that was frustrating.   I guess the manager noticed and came over and asked if we'd mind sitting with some other people at those tables. I, being hungover and not wanting to be judged whilst I shoveled unhealthy greasy wings and a burger in my gullet, said no. I explained that we were just there to eat and would not be camping out to watch Sunday football. Why couldn't we have one of the two empty 4 tops? He wouldn't budge and said that's the way they were seating people. I call bullshit. The last time we were in on a busy Saturday, we sat by ourselves at a booth, ate, and left. No fuss. I didn't even complain when my sweet jalapeno burger came out and was missing the freaking jalapeno sauce. I was too hungry and just ate it and said nothing.   Well, I am tired of making excuses for Zipps. Their fries are often flacid. The service is hit and miss. The beer selection sucks. Now they won't even fill their own tables? What the heck?Am I decked out in NFL gear like I'm going to pretend your restaurant is my living room? No, I just wanted to eat. But I had to take my money elsewhere to do that. We weren't the only ones who chose to leave either, I watched 3 other couples go while we were waiting. I'm still pissed we weren't told up front that's the way they were going to do the seating. Instead, we had to stand around and wait. At least those single guys at the 4 booths by the bar provided comic relief.

Hands down the best BBQ in the greater Phoenix area. That's right. I said greater Phoenix area. Because it is better than Rudy's (which I heard is getting a location in Chandler). How could I make such a huge statement? How dare I? Because I am from Texas. I know good down home service and food and this is it. Plus my fiance is a BBQ snob (also from Texas). He takes it very seriously (it's a little funny but cute).   We got the brisket and the pork ribs with sides of creamed corn and beans. So good. Top it off with Shiner and I was in heaven. Seriously, I felt like a kid again just after finishing a long trail ride (minus the Shiner, of course). We also got to taste the jalapeno sausage and it was delicious.   I can't wait to go back and try every single thing on this menu. The service was the best in the city. THIS is what good service looks like, Phoenix!! Y'all don't even know!!

I was excited to try this place on our side of town as we've had takeout from another location and loved it.   We came in and there was a wait for a two top. No biggie, we both got a glass of wine and waited just a short while before our table opened up. We sat down having had maybe 4 sips of our wine.   We waited.   And waited.   We had our wine....   But no menus.    I joked that it was like Costa Rica and the slow service there. I was in a good mood and happy to sit down after a long day on my feet.   Still with the waiting.   No... STILL MORE with the waiting!  Now it was not funny anymore and we were being completely ignored. I checked my clock and it was 7:57pm. Clearly not a closing time issue. I tried to assuage my companion by telling him how tired I used to get after a big rush and they were probably trying to catch their breath.   Yeah... that argument only holds weight for so long before you realize you've still been sitting there with a glass of wine from the bar and NO MENUS OR ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM ANYONE. Seriously the guy who seated us was really nice. Where was he?  A girl came around and put place settings out at 4 tables. ALL AROUND US.   Still. No service.   Fuck. Are you kidding me? I was seriously patient. I know what working in the service industry is like. This is ridiculous.   "If we finish our glasses of wine and no one has said a single word to us... we are leaving".   "But you are not allowed to chug your wine".   "Deal".  {{{insert witty conversation for 5 minutes}}}  Alright. All done. We have not sped up our drinking. We were very fair and patient... up we go.   And we left.   Would you have done anything different?

Went here for trivia last night and the place was pretty slammed and we ended up outside the room where trivia was being held in an awkward lean over the bar and try to hear area. We had two high tops pushed together and the rest of the group was at the bar. It made for interesting relay of the question/answer. The bartender seemed really nice- but for the people at the high top, we really didn't get service unless we got pushy about it or got up to get it. It would have been really nice if a waitress would have helped up our tables or if the bartender could have relayed with someone to make it happen, but alas it did not. So I just had one beer when I would have ordered more and didn't order food. You wait so long to order then you just get frustrated and don't want to spend your money there anyway. I stopped somewhere else on my way home for a tasty burger (not my first choice- the pizza looked yummy). Shame- I wasn't the only one at the table who under ordered because of the snafu.

Had a lovely brunch here and can't wait to go back for dinner. I had the fried egg sandwich which was delicious. My fiance had the frittata because he wanted as much veg as possible after his morning run. I enjoyed my sandwich so much that I didn't get a taste of his frittata. The ambiance was great and we had a bottle of Prosecco to enjoy over a leisurely brunch. I wished I had room for something sweet because a lady near us got the apple pie looking thing and it smelled so good. We debated getting a cinnamon roll to go but another diner near us had a half eaten one left on a plate which signaled to me that it was not to die for. So I passed.   My two complaints about the experience were: 1. The parking. was. ridiculous. There was a mostly empty lot but we were forced to use the "complimentary" valet. Complimentary my ass. You have to tip. That is not "complimentary". They should allow patrons to park themselves if the restaurant lot is less than half full. Otherwise... I might choose to go somewhere else that doesn't rip me off and waste my time with this nonsense. Seriously, I almost asked him to hand me the keys because the car was 20 feet away. Not cool.   2. The bowl for the potatoes with the egg sandwich is beautiful. However, it is not functional. It scoots all over the plate when you try to get a bite and it wobbles like crazy. Frustrating, because the potatoes were delicious but went unfinished because they were such a pain to eat.

Great beer selection, but we were just in for lunch. I was definitely tempted, but remained a good girl. Or was a good girl for once... potato... pah-ta-tah.   The spinach/artichoke/crab dip was really good. I need to find those yummy yucca chips by the bag. I really liked how the dip wasn't too heavy and cheesy. Nice clean flavors. We then spit the chicken salad sandwich with the side of the gnocci for an extra dollar. The gnocci for an extra buck was a STEAL. Seriously... should I have snuck out the back? Holy crap was that gnocci good. The chicken salad sandwich was super yummy too and I loved that it was served on a croissant.   Service was great and we will definitely return soon. Next time I will get beer!

I've had two really nice experiences here and think this will be my go-to place for a pedicure. I've yet to experience a wait and my pedicure lasts for-ev-er. Plus, it's a great value that includes a bonus hot stone massage.

After our first visit a week after opening, it was obvious that there were some kinks to work out. The first visit, I was impressed by the beer selection. It was wonderful and definitely lead to our second visit. The misses to me the first go around were the food and the noise level. The outdoor patio was also very dark. The lighting was better for the second visit, but I have yet to retry the food. I got the pizza but wasn't impressed. Just an odd flavor paring. The noise level wasn't as bad this time, but that could have been because it wasn't as busy and  opening the doors also helped. Can't wait to get back for more good beer and great patio weather soon.

So happy this food truck establishment now has a brick and mortar restaurant. Grabbed lunch here and will soon be back. This visit I tried to have something I hadn't tried yet so we got the corn dog bites, the oliver and hubby got the moki (which looked great, but too messy to share- or he just liked it too much). I really liked mine and the jalapeno cheese stuffed corn dog bites were my favorite. I almost wish that the app only included these and not the plain hot dog filled bites. Luckily for me I think they know this and I think only 2 out of the 6 were the regular bites. We didn't have a beer this time and I spent quite a bit of time regretting my decision because they had such a stellar selection. Great local and not so local craft beers are available. Must drink next time! Also- I miss the fried pickles and the lady hot dog I tried on a prior taste at the truck, so I will have to visit more often to work my way through the menu! Aw, shucks.

Hands down the best sushi in Phoenix. Yes, I know I've said that about other establishments before... but that was before Harumi.   After a second visit last night we were blown away by how wonderful this place is. Last night we again got the 5 nigiri, 6 sashimi, and we asked if we could substitute the oasis roll in favor of the crazy roll, which they did without hesitation. The crazy roll is crazy good and the fish is the perfect combination tucked into the yummy and unique purple rice. The rolls are just bite site, not those giant ones that make you look like a chipmunk trying not to choke. We also started with the jalapeno poppers, which were light, fresh, not overpowered with cream cheese, and just the right amount of spicy. Will definitely order these again. The last visit we had the crispy stuffed shrimp to start which were amazing- so I think I just have to order both and have leftovers.   Now the fish... the fish is ridiculously fresh and the highest quality. The lines of fat in the salmon and the melt in your mouth as your eyes roll back in your head... yes, I get that I am talking about food. But this is an experience in joy. I wanted to bow a thousand times over to the chef on the way out. Thank you, thank you for coming to Phoenix!
