Pita Jungle has earned a very special place in my heart as "comfort food".  I've been enjoying their incredible food for over 10 years now.  I feel confident in assuring you that anything on the menu is thoughtfully crafted and Incredibly delicious. As much as I adore this establishment, I will offer one warning: My friends and I typically avoid the apache Blvd. location. 90% of the time we manage to get a server named something akin to "rainbow flower" or "moon stream" and they tend to forget you are there or choose to ignore you completely.  Rest  assured, the food is consistently amazing, It's just the service.  This location (ray rd.), however, has always impressed me with impeccable service.

It was quite a thrill to discover an independent bagel shop in my neighborhood.  After having more than a few disappointing occasions at Einstein Brothers, I thought I would be banished to the land of grocery store bagels.  Luckily, I found back east bagels.  The bagels are FAR better than anything you will find in a grocery store or at Einsteins and their menu is very diverse making it a great place for breakfast or lunch.

This single location has completely turned me away from Einstein Brothers.  On the several occasions I have been there, I have encountered mediocre food and an incompetent staff.  If you are a fan of this chain, avoid this location.

As a bit of a jaded and cynical individual, I feel I should begin by suggesting that you not be dissuaded by the campy name.  The manager seems to genuinely care about his establishment, and it shows.  The Slouvaki alone is well worth the trip.  As someone who considers feta cheese his personal kryptonite, I feel I would be remiss to not suggest the feta burger.  The wait staff is VERY attentive and helpful.  Combine all of this with a clean and attractive atmosphere, and you have found a great dining experience.

I hesitated in writing this review as I truly feel it is one of the valleys best kept secrets.  You see, inside this whole foods is an amazing bar with over 20 AMAZING beers on tap.  You will not find your average domestic swill here.  What you will find is a dazzling assortment of some of the finest beer produced.  The proverbial "icing on the cake" is James.  James knows more about beer than the monks that perfected it.  He is always quick with a thoughtful suggestion and willing to share his knowledge.  You wine drinkers will find more than enough to keep you happy as well.

I lived in the south for 5 years.  I like to think that time spent there , eating at every barbecue joint I could find, has possibly made me some sort of low-level barbecue aficionado.  With that being said,  Chandler BBQ company is nothing to go out of your way for.  While their barbecue sauce is quite tasty, the brisket I had was as dry as shoe leather.  What was touted as "sweet potato fries" were some kind of previously frozen sweet potato tater tot.  Finally, the corn bread would be better served as a door stop.
