I loved this place it was so cute. We went here for brunch today and we sat out on the patio through another reviewer's suggestion. The waitress we had was wonderful and very attentive. Even though I do not have a dog I loved how it was a dog friendly patio, and they even bring water and treats for your treasured pups! The coffee was good, and I had a strawberry waffle and my husband had scrambled eggs with cheese, toast, and fried potatoes. The music was also cool as we are both fans of the 50's. I will come back here again as it was very reasonably priced.

I absolutely love this doctor and today was my first time meeting her. She was full of life and personality. I like my doctors to have a good bedside manner. I just moved here to Scottsdale a month ago from RI and I really liked my gyno back home and I really was hoping that I would find another one that I really liked. I appreciated the fact that before the actual exam we went into her office to talk about medical history and other questions and concerns. She actually eased my fears on some tests that I recently had done by an endocrinologist. I was referred to her by our realtor whose wife also sees Dr. Haas. So far I am very impressed by the doctors here.

I was shopping a little on my 30th birthday in Old Town and I decided here to stop here (Feb. 4th) for lunch. My husband was at the Double Tree down the street at a trade show so I figured I would try to enjoy my day. I ate by the bar and had a wonderful conversation with the restaurant's manager Rose. She had an outstanding personality and actually got me through this bittersweet day, as all my friends are back in RI and I was sort of having a lonely 30th. I had the roast beef sandwich with the au jous sauce, salad and fries. I also had a glass of riesling (my personal favorite). And as Rose and I were talking about the difficulties of relocation I mentioned it was my birthday- no not to get anything for free. But I was treated to another glass of wine on the house and a slice of cheesecake. She did tell me that she does not work on Saturdays- sorry to other Yelpers who had bad customer service- she did tell me about Karokee but my singing days are over. I would definitely go back for lunch again just because I was treated so well.

I am with some of the others in not understanding these poor reviews. I am from Rhode Island and Italian food is at our fingertips, and in Arizona, there are few and far between authentic non chain Italian restaurants. I feel that although ambiance is important, I didn't see anything wrong with Lo Cascio's. There were no cheesy paper protectors over a linen table cloth, and there were no paper place mats with several business names, so not sure what the issue was there. And as far as the music....I would be annoyed too if I had to work there every night, but again, it only added to the atmosphere. In my opinion, some of the best Italian food does not come with yuppie atmosphere.   For the appetizer we had the fried mozzarella which my husband and I enjoyed very much. The marinara poured over it was on the chunkier side and I loved it because it tasted just like a sauce an old Italian friend of mine made. It was perfect. I had eggplant parmesan for my entree, and it tasted just like NYC Italian. The eggplant didn't have the shit fried out of it, and it had the finest light coating just the way I love my favorite dish. And my husband had veal milanese which was out of this world. It was in a sauce of lemon and wine, mushrooms and artichokes.   I also want to mention, we had the most Attentive waitress that I have ever had. Her name is Katie, and she was very sweet always asking us after each course if we needed anything and how everything tasted.   We will definitely be back here, we live down the road now in our new home and I am very happy there is a great little Italian restaurant nearby. I am also happy I didn't let the negative reviews scare me.

Yes, finally!!! This is an Italian restaurant worth going to in Scottsdale. You will definitely get what you paid for and more. We had a fantastic experience here last Thursday. The food was phenomenal, and this restaurant deserves many kudos. First, the ambiance was great. We ate outside and I must say it is a gorgeous patio. The inside looked pretty too but it was too good of a night to waste indoors. I had a real nice chardonnay to go with a stellar meal. I forgot the name of it but I loved it. All of us had a special, my dad had a halibut which was cooked in a special type of paper, I had homemade linguine with sun dried tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, shrimp in a light lemon and garlic sauce, my husband had chicken milanese, and my dad's lady friend had veal marsala. It was out of this world. OOh I cannot forget the appetizers.....We had proscuitto with fresh mozzarella, and we had portabella mushroom salad with a balsamic reduction. To top the night off we had tiramisu which was delightful. Thanks to all the Yelpers out there with their reviews, this truly was a great evening out.

My husband took me here for my 30th birthday! YAH! I was not disappointed! I thought the decor here was out of this world and it takes so much talent to design like this....As some of you are food snobs I am a food and ambiance snob. We had the pita chips and hummus to start which was so good. A great feature added to the hummus was cucumbers which added a nice crunch. I also enjoyed tomato bisque soup which was out of this world. I think the waiter we had was nice but did not seem to have much of a personality which I do look for in my dining experience. I would go back here but not too soon as I have a whole list of places I would like to try now that I just moved here!

I came here a few weeks ago and I really loved it. I thought it was great that most of the ingredients were vegan and vegetarian friendly. My husband and I came here for breakfast. I had a strawberry banana smoothie and my husband had a chocolate, coffee peanut butter protein shake to die for. And we had bagels that were very tasty. I would love to come back here for lunch, everything sounded excellent, especially the soup. I was also impressed with the staff....I thought that was the best feature of this whole place. They are super friendly, and this one guy, was SOOOOOOOO Funny the way he was greeting people and making jokes. It was very outgoing and it made the customers feel like they had been coming there forever even if it was their first time. It also makes patrons and business owners feel like they are an important part of the community with the camaraderie that takes place here. I am looking forward to returning.

As a fellow New Englander I was so happy to see this Vermont Sandwich Shop. I actually learned about it from a flyer that was sent to us through the mail giving a nice discount. However, they are not open past 5:00pm and that was pretty disappointing considering how yummy their sandwiches sounded on the menu. The first time we went there it was Veteran's Day. I had a wrap with some fantastic chicken salad. It was to die for. My husband had the Italian Stallion Sandwich and it was terrific. They have some great combination's and everything there is very fresh. I have been there three times since Veteran's Day!! I tried their chilli today and a taste of my husband's french onion soup with homemade croutons. The sandwiches are definitely hefty so I agree with the others that you need to go here with an appetite. I also enjoy the New England/Vermont-like decor with it's Ben and Jerry elements of the 70's tie-dyed shirts and Dead Head posters. Great spot to get a nice lunch. Their only downfall is that they probably are not getting the exposure that they need because it is so tucked into this plaza. This is definitely a place that I will be frequenting quite a bit! PS- Try the cookies!!

It was ok seafood. Real unimpressed by chewy calamari overly fried with dipping sauce that is ketchup with a bit of cayenne pepper- gross. Calamari best cooked is lightly fried, with a butter garlic sauce, porchini pepper rings, and a zesty marinara sauce. It also shouldn't be tough or chewy it should melt in your mouth. I had a shrimp in marinara and it didn't have much flavor. This isn't one of the better chains at Tempe Markerplace. I won't be coming back here. I'm from New England so maybe I'm picky....

I have been here twice and I am impressed. The salads here are amazing, and I love the atmosphere (especially the mango vinaigrette dressing), as it is very funky and bright. This looks like a great place for happy hour. I have eaten on the patio, and that is very nice too with lots of shade. I also had the chicken tortilla soup which was great with an avocado slice in there and a small drop of sour cream. It had a nice kick of spice! The prices are great and portions are hefty!

Yelper's unite!! You people were not kidding when you said they have an awesome happy hour and margarita's! As I am a huge fan of margarita's and I believe not many places know how to make them right, Z Teja's did not disappoint. I look for a margarita that is swift to knock you right on your ass. There, I admitted that I like to have the tequila kick when I drink. I had one (ok I lied two) of their raspberry swirl margarita's (which I cannot tell you what the hell they called it) that almost looked too pretty to drink. However, I was disappointed in their nachos as I thought they would have all the glorious toppings besides just black bean cheese and lettuce....come on people step up the Mexican. They also had cornbread which was brought out like bread, and I love cornbread but not sure I liked the actual pieces of corn?! New Englanders are not used to our cornbread that way....But I really think this place has its drinks together, and I wouldn't mind going back again sometime....

Kelley from San Fransisco took the words right out of my mouth. The food is definitely for people who haven't a clue what Italian food is all about. I am going to start off with what was good. I thought the bread was great, and a good idea to make the bread almost pizza like with the sauce on top. We both had Insalatina Misto (salads) and that was pretty good with a nice balsamic dressing. However, I found the actual meals greatly disappointing. Are they cooking for low sodium diets here? I could not understand the lack of salt or none in these dishes. First of all, I don't mind salt. I don't want it to taste like the ocean, but to not put in any? That was questionable to me. I ordered  Farfalle Pollo, which was described as a light tomato cream sauce, peas, onions and mushrooms. There was no taste. No salt, garlic or even pepper. It tasted like watery tomatoes and flavorless chicken. I also had half of the Gnocchi, which included proscuitto, peas, and onions. This was only a little better. If it was not for the proscuitto it would have been flavorless. They also offered no grated parm or coarse black pepper. I have to say, I have yet to find a good Italian restaurant here. I am definitely used to East Coast Italian, and Rhode Island knows its pasta.   I also want to point out, whoever deemed this restaurant "dressy" maybe might have wanted to specify to dress up if your going to participate in the nightlife aspect of this restaurant. I had a dress on and my husband had his khakis and a nice button down shirt. I saw people in their touristy  shorts, Hawaiian shirts, and those awful Teva-sneaker-velcro sandals.    I would not waste my money on another meal here. I most likely would go back for the band or drinks. The decor is great, I definitely think it is one of those places that has a nice aura of mystery, and seductive red walls. I hate to be nasty, but  paying $$$ is a lot of money to waste on mediocrity. Some of the Scottsdalian restaurants here thrive on this beautiful expensive decor, but they have yet to invest in a decent chef.

With a name like "The Lodge", I thought I was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neighborhood locals. We went here after a soccer game two weeks ago, and I have to say, I thought I was going to be disappointed. I expected greasy food, and grimy scenery. This was not the case, although the scenery was mildly disturbing as most of the decor included some dearly departed wildlife. I had a great sandwich I believe called the healthy choice, that was supposedly was healthy? It came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread, egg whites, hollindase sauce, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I don't think it was a calorie saver by any means but I am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients. For a lodge, this was a terrific restaurant, and yes this is a compliment by far, joking aside, as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about. This is nothing like the local VFW. The only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off, and throw it across the room. And ladies, no, this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny. They need to enforce the shirt and shoes required law here otherwise it will earn a lodgey reputation from me. Luckily, as this ghastly sight appeared, we quickly disappeared on our way home.

I have come here 4 times, and it hasn't disappointed! They have terrific service and are always accommodating when I bring my 15 month old. They have a great happy hour but I would like to see them increase their wine list. They have fantastic salads and appetizers. Sometime I would love to go for their breakfast/brunch.

I came to Becky for a few reasons, but the main one was to change my life. I was so tired of traditional counselors, and telling them the same old story without improvement. It's tiring when you tell the same story and nothing changes. I found Becky on the Thumbtack website. I had a good feeling about her, especially the fact she was willing to work with my financial needs-this is always a good sign. My first consultation with her- no hypnotherapy- I actually felt better. I felt like finally I was on the right track to handling my past traumas and current situation. She told me she would get me off my anxiety meds in that first counsultation. Lo and behold after only a consultation I felt no neeed to take them anymore. I purchased five sessions with Becky after the consultation because I was confident she was able to help me put some of my demons at rest. And she did that and more. I felt comfortable with her because she is a very real, nice, honest and funny person. She made me feel at ease immediately. She validated my feelings and gave me a new perspective on self defeating thoughts and thinking. Hypnotherapy for me was not being hypnotized and not knowing what the heck I was doing or saying. I was aware, in a guided relaxed state, with positive thoughts entering my mind. My favorite was the last session where I did a bit of past life regression. Becky will not make you go through a negative experience, in fact she takes you out of it almost immediately, unless she has questions about the event. The other thing I love about Becky is that she is always in contact with her patients. She texts and emails which to me is fabulous. Don't be surprised if you get a text out of the blue or an email to find out how you are doing. Even if the sessions are up she still wants to know how you are doing. This is a fabulous woman, teacher and friend. I can't imagine saying anything bad about her. She truly understands and knows what she is doing. I love her and plan to get periodic sessions from her. I also will listen to whatever she tells me to do to help in my self healing process. She is truly such an inspiring person. -On another note, if you do not know where your life is going or where you should be, she will tell you. She unlocked my dream of writing children's books.

Just wanted to re-check in here. I came to Becky for another session. I am 9 months pregnant and at 8mos I felt that I needed to go see her to mentally prepare for the new baby. Its my second child, and I have been feeling very emotional like a typical preggo. I have a little girl at home who is almost 3 and I was nervous about how a new baby will effect our life. As usual without me even telling Becky a lot of my concerns, she already knew how I was feeling. I can't say I am 100% because at this point I am uncomfortable and emotional. But I am not as witchy to my husband and he appreciates that.
