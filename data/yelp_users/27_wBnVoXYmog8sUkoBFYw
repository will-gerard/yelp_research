I love this place. Very knowledgeable about plants and they have a great selection. Herbs and vegetables are quite inexpensive and they have a great selection of trees.

I used to love Venezias but last time I had it it was just not up to snuff.  Seems to be steadily going downhill. The pizza we ordered did not have anything resembling BBQ sauce but BBQ permeated the pizza. Not a fan. Will stick to Barro's.

Everyone is super friendly and the Joe latti is the best (Italian ice and ice cream mixed).
