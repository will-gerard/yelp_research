I have been coming to this Drs office since my first child was born, 12 years ago. I am very satisfied with the Drs and medical staff. Very caring and thorough. My 1 star lies with their office staff and deceptive practices. 1st, when I come for a visit they require my deductible to be paid up front. Which is fine because I have a one time deductible per year. However when they send off the paperwork to my insurance company they fail to note that my deductible was paid. That caused me to have to pay a deductible at a different Dr for my child. When I called the office they said they dont have to document it because they consider it a credit. 2nd, I bring my child back for a follow up two days later. Deductible has already been met, twice. They tell me my insurance company says I now have a 20.00 coinsurance that has to be paid. I paid it. Than talked to my insurance company who said I have no coinsurance. Its sad that such great Drs are going to be overshadowed by bad office policies. Time to find another Dr.

Had dinner here last night with family and after reading all the other reviews, I decided to write mine. I have been coming to this location for a few years. Never have had a bad experience. After seeing the negative reviews it makes me wonder if the people had actually came here or they are just natural whiners who complain about everything.  1st. When we arrived we were promptly seated. Just like all the other times we have been here. Even when we come for a birthday celebration and have 15+ people we never wait more than 10 minutes.   After being seated we had chips and salsa brought to our table immediately and our drink orders were taken shortly thereafter. I can't say how long because I don't carry a stopwatch to time how long everything takes. Apparently others do reading other reviews where they say they sat for ten minutes, it took 10 minutes to get drinks, etc.   When our drink orders were taken, our server asked if we would like any appetizers to start. We ordered two cheese crisps.  The cheese crisps came out in a timely manner. (Again not timed.) They were very good. Definitely recommend the cheese crisp for an appetizer.   After bringing drinks the server took our order. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and helped us with our orders. I had the beef chimi with rice and sour cream and guacamole. Here's the only negative thing I have to say about this restaurant. The red sauce on top of the Chimi was a little sweet for me. My cousin ordered the same thing and made the comment that the sauce tasted like ketchup. That's not a bash on the food. I just didn't care for it. Next time I know order without the sauce on top.   We also went to the bar area. The bartender, Taylor, was very friendly. I have known Taylor since I started coming to Macayos and have never had an experience that was unpleasant. The guy is always smiling, friendly, and happy.   It was an overall good experience and I definitely recommend everyone try the food here.

I was transferred to St Joes/Barrows from the VA Emergency room two weeks ago.  My Dr from the VA called and and spoke with a Dr from St Joes prior to my arrival because I needed to be admitted and given additional care the VA couldn't provide.  I was given an IV and transferred by an ambulance from the VA to St Joes. I have 2 problems with St Joes. 1. They knew I was coming. I came by Ambulance. But once there, they made the ambulance staff wheel me out into the main waiting room and register me while I was laying in their ambulance bed in the main waiting room. After words, I had to go and answer all the questions again. Than I was put in a room where a Dr came in and read over my paperwork that came with me me from the VA. I was than put into a seperate waiting room. I was called again to answer questions on why I was there. I explained I was transferred from another hospital. 2. I came with an IV already put in. The 3rd nurse to register me at St Joes decided to remove the IV because I was in a waiting area and there wasn't "eyes" on me at all times. When I was finally admitted and given a room, the nurse said the IV should have been left in so I wouldnt have to have another one put in.  I was admitted and spent a couple days there. The nurses made my stay as comfortable as can be expected. The food wasn't bad at all. Other than getting wheeled out in the lobby and having my IV pulled out I have no complaints and would have given 5 stars.

Everytime I come to this particular Subway I remember why I avoid this one. Lets start with the food. If you order a kids meal, they use the leftover scraps of bread. Today, it was no longer than an inch and a half. One piece of ham folded over and it hung out the sides. Two pickles and a glob of mayonnaise the size of a dime in the middle. Lets go to their menu. Right now, 6" cold cut or meatball subs are 2.00. They dont have that posted ANYWHERE. they tried to charge me full price and I had to show them my e-mail. With that said, good luck getting much veggies on your sandwich. While they make your sandwich you actually get the feeling you are inconveniencing them. They throw everything in very sloppy. Vinefar and oil they squirt in one spot.  Very rude staff. I usually avoid this particular one. When I do come back to it, its always the same. Drive an extra couple miles to a different one.

Attempted to make it for breakfast. Got in line 45 minutes before breakfast was over and didnt move very quickly and missed breakfast. Let me add the line wasnt very long. The food was ok for a low price buffet. The server that waited on our table was very quick, very friendly, and had a good sense of humor which is needed when waiting on my crazy family.

When they built this Walmart, they put in the El Mirage mailout it was the biggest Walmart in the State of Arizona! I don't see it.  Whenever I shop here, regardless of the time of day or night, the wait time in the checkout lines is ridiculous! I see it as a problem when I spend more time standing in line than I do shopping. The tax in El Mirage is ridiculous. Your better off going to the Surprise Walmart to make big purchases. The one good thing I can say about this Walmart is the greeters are all very friendly.

Just stopped in for chips and salsa and a cheese crisp yesterday. Food was good and service was as well. This is a good place to go to get good Mexican food. I have eaten here numerous times.

Ate here two days ago with a couple friends. Ordered the all you can eat soup and salad for lunch. French Onion soup and grilled shrimp and spinach salad. The food was very good. The two stars come from the service that we had. Our server was Kayla. She took forever to take our order. Never brought us a refill on drinks. We had to ask someone else because she didn't come by for so long. We all got the all you can eat lunch but trying to get a refill on the soup or salad was next to impossible. And when we did order it, it took 15 minutes to come out.  While the food was good, I definitely recommend going to a different Applebees where you can actually get waited on.

The food here is excellent! The service is excellent! I'm hooked. I have been here a bunch of times. If anyone has a bad experience at this restaurant, I highly recommend you say something to them! They will fix it. And if you leave unhappy, go back and give them another try.

As always the food and service were exceptional. The Oyster poboy is flavorful and the red beans and rice is great. Great place to eat.

I've been looking for a good Cuban sandwich since I moved from Tampa, FL. I've tried a couple different places and nothing compared. Than I came here today. The service was very quick. My food was hot. And the Cuban Sandwich was very tasty. Just like I remember them from Florida. Reminds me of the little Cuban restaurant right outside of MacDill AFB.  The price was great for the size of the sandwich. $7.95 for sandwich and fries and .99 for a 12oz can of soda and a glass of ice. The sandwich was a good size. Half of it is going home for later.  Definately recommend although not good for large parties. Only 6 tables in the restaurant. Seats 23 people inside.

Been to this Deli twice. The first time I went for lunch and was not impressed with the food for the price. I went back a second time for breakfast. Ordered an Omelet. The ingredients were practically non existent. Again the food was not worth the price. I give it two stars because the service is great from the servers. Very friendly and helpful. Too bad their not the cooks as well! I may give it one more chance.

Went here for a cheap breakfast. The restaurant was more than half empty but waited about 15 minutes for 7 of us to be seated. The price of the food was great and the food was very good. However, the service was the worst we received in a 4 day span in Vegas. The staff in the restaurant made us feel as if we were interrupting them. Very very unfriendly and unprofessional. The server and the lady who worked the counter at the end is the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars.

Very quick service despite it being Frappucchino Happy Hour. I like this particular Starbucks because regardless of time of day there is always somewhere to sit and plug in my computer. My only complaint today was I paid extra to have caramel syrup on the inside of the cup and they it was very scarce. If I wouldn't have paid extra for it, I wouldn't care but I like getting what I pay for.

The food here is very good. The staff is very nice. I eat here quite a bit. Just wished they delivered but the pizza and wings are worth the drive to pick up.

Stopped in last night. The place was really busy but the line went pretty quickly. The size of the scoops were pretty good. Just not sure if its worth the price they charge. But that's just my opinion.  A family of four could expect to spend over $20.00 for an outing here for dessert which may not sound like a lot but for ice cream?. If you don't mind the prices I definitely recommend this place. The ice cream did have good flavor. I really have no reason to not give it 5 stars based on the atmosphere and the quality of the ice cream. The staff was very friendly and offered samples of any of the ice creams I wanted to sample. I'll definitely be back at some point.

This is a great place to watch a Sunday Night Football game. There's enough TVs it doesn't matter where you sit or which way you look, you can always see whats going on. The medium Buffalo wings have great flavor. Probably some of the better wings I have eaten and I eat a lot of wings. The Mozzarella cheese sticks are different than any I have ever had. They too were great.  The service was great.  The prices were cheaper than I expected. I will definitely go back.

Food is good and delivery is quick. Eat from here often and have never had a bad experience. Try the Singapore Rice Noodles if you eat here.

I found this restaurant when they were located in Buckeye. I have tried everything on the menu probably more than once and have never been disappointed. My favorite is the Red-Chili Frybread with cheese added. The service is excellent there. You always get treated friendly and with a smile!

Ate breakfast here yesterday for Mothers Day. The food was less than acceptable. Eggs were really overcooked. Ham was overcooked and really tough. Even the bacon wasn't right. I mean, how can someone mess up bacon? Coffee was barely warm in the pot they bring you out. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because despite the quality of the food, the servers were doing the best they could. And they were friendly. I realize that it was mothers day and they were busy, but it's a restaurant. There's no excuse for the food to be bad regardless of how busy they get.

Came for the first time. Got the Turkey, Bacon, Avocado sandwich with the citrus spinach salad. The sandwich came out nice and hot. Really cheesy with a lot of flavor. Every bite had more than just bread so no disappointment there.  The salad was good however the goat cheese was a little overpowering. It had a fair amount of fruit in it and just the right amount of vinagerette.  Every meal comes with a piece of bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry. The bread was good. The strawberry was also good.  When you are done, leave everything on the table. They pick up your trays.

Went in not knowing exactly what I wanted, just that I wanted something really nice. Was immediately greeted by a gentleman who offered his assistance.  Told him I wanted something to compliment a beautiful lady. He said give him 5 minutes and he will have something nice made up. He went to work and made a beautiful arrangement that was beyond what I expected. I love giving flowers to my lady and this florist has just made themselves a loyal customer.
