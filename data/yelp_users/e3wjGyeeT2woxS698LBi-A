GREAT coffee, horrendously slow service with other employees not interested in helping knock down the line. If you are just getting coffee, hit the drive-thru - you'll be less frustrated.

Some of the best hot wings that I have ever had...and they always have cold, local beer on tap. Tempe's finest (Long Wong's on Mill owners) in Chandler.

Some of the best beers that I have tasted & food that you would NOT expect from a brewery. It is more of a gastro-brewery.

I love, love, loved this place! We went there yesterday, a party of nine at 4:30 pm & tried a variety of items within our group. Oysters, frog legs, angry edamame & chicken wings to start. The oysters were plump, the frog legs were crispy and the Cajun spice on the edamame was tasty. Our party once again ran the gamut in ordering entrees, blue crab, snow crab, king crab, lobster & Dungeness crab. My Dungeness crab was nearly 3 lbs. of awesomeness in trifecta sauce & hot level heat & it was an amazing mess. You have to work hard to get to the meat, but it is an ever so rewarding treasure hunt. Our service from Alice was impeccable and the local beer selection was an added bonus. Make sure that you aren't wearing anything too nice as far as clothing, get there early as we did, there was a long wait when we left at 6:30 pm. Also, no ice cream for dessert and they don't take American Express. All in all, a wonderful visit, it was so nice to patronize a local Mom & Pop shop that is better than every large chain with unlimited resources. The food here was just THAT GOOD. Run, don't walk to the Angry Crab Shack in Mesa.
