I had heard so much about this being the best Chinese in town, so disappointed!!The people very nice friendly as can be. They get five star's it was the food. I got one of the lunch specials egg drop soup came with it, I added crab cheese puffs.  First there was NO crab in the crab cheese puffs, just cream cheese. (one of my biggest pet peeves when ordering this dish) The soup bowl was not even half full and the soup had no taste. My main entr√©e was o.k. nothing I would order again Its clear they have a loyal customer base. It may take another try, but for me that wont be anytime soon.

If you are thinking of stopping there you better keep driving to the other side of India School to Da Vang. If you want Bad food, Bad service and an incorrect order well this is your place. It was take out, or I would of walked out of the restaurant. Lets start  unfriendly, no cutomer service skills very abrupt  I did not know the worst was to come. Food the worst Pho Soup I ever had .As I opened up the container it was 3/4 and a disgusting layer of grease floating on top there was enough that you could measure it. So in good faith I tried to soak up the grease with napkins.  Less than half a container later I made that second attempt but all I tasted was grease.  That order was out. The order of fried egg roles should come with mint, lettuce and parsley. NO mint. I requested an extra fish sauce for fresh spring rolls (which were rubbery by the way) in addition to the peanut sauce. So when I opened the fresh rolls fish sauce no peanut sauce. I asked for extra sprouts,well I am sure you can figure out the answer no did not get them. In short as I retreated the beginning keep on driving Da Vang is north on Indian School on the west side of the street  I have almost never have establishment a worse rating

Everyone gave it great stars, the service was terrible as was the food I ate , Everyone raved about the mussels. The worst ever. fishy tasting over cooked couldn't eat it pita pita garlic triangles  really? and how are you soaking up the sauce? I am a mussel lover grew up in the northwest so that it self ruined it their.   It took for ever to get the food despite their was no one in the restaurant. God forbid you order a drink they poor to a tee measure everything and over charge. The pad Thai no flavor little bang for the buck go to VIG  on 44th street much better better and it isn't even Asian.  We came because it had good rating clearly people don't know food or they had bad cooks that day.   I would not recommend or ever go there again.

PLEASE READ... I give this review for a multiple of reasons. One I reject the statement made by another that because the chefs are not Asian they made that a statement in there review how that would affect the quality I don't know. I have always appreciated the service and the quality of food. The complaint of expensive came up, the restaurant it is not inexpensive, but not over the top as many establishments are.  I usually do not sit at a table but did because of family. A situation arose.....The management was quick to resolve the issue,  and  I thank them for that. I am by myself most the time, but brought my husbands grandparents (who are not easy to satisfy) and the people next to us  offended them,but except for the disruption they really enjoyed the experience, food was great,and I also appreciated the establishment for accommodating and responding to the situation. I don't know everyones names who were working that evening but THANK YOU ALL....I hope you never second guess this place its perfect for young and old. If you are ever unhappy just tell them they will fix it....Don't write negative reviewes  until you have tried to resolve an issue waitstaff work hard to resolve mistakes.... It is how they resolve them is what counts!

Well my second time here very impressed and   disappointed  but lean to impressed. I like specialty items uni being one of them told they would have it on weekends ONLY......went in saterday sold out . With that being said they were very apologetic. Took a to go order they were very compromising my order perfect and then some. I'm a sashimi person it's hard to find in Phoenix.  I do recommend it here. From Seattle Musashi in seattle the only place to go for true sashimi or simple sushi fans. Next to that in Phoenix I recommend here. Thank you for your gracious hospitality and quality.

A gem of a salon downtown. We frequent the restaurant Fez next door they recommended the salon, My husband went to Ryan loved him. It was a cool venue great vibe, so I decided to go with my husbands recommendation. My husband with impeccable taste was right. They have multiple stylists I can speak for Ryan Valdez who did a smashing job on my color and cut. I am so pleased to find something close to home, and someone who really enjoys what he does and takes pride in his work.

Best furniture store ever. Great customer service no one on commission everyone there is helpful and friendly. Add to that the great variety what is on the web site is in the store. You can customize any piece with no charge. I wont shop anywhere else.

I have not eaten there BUT I know customers service is beyond belief. Live downtown we spend time on Westside found them on yelp rang because could not find menu. Jenny who answered sent me pics of menu and even responded to text messages. WHO DOES THAT! Thank you as you know we don't see that much. Look forward to eating there!

Still great people great food. Love the chicken strips and my favorite drink is the G Spot. Which is on special on Thursdays. They have a great brunch Saturday and Sundays till three. Happy hour every day from 4:00 to 6:30. Same great owners of Switch and Peoples Pizza Pub you should try them as well. north on central. Dont hesitate because of parking  there is a puplic free  garage in back. What makes this place so great is the people who work here and the owners who always are engaging. Its five star all the way around.

So my husband i  went in on a whim....we chose to sit at the two seat Bar. The owner chef was there and we stayed.We did  the pairing menu. It was AMAZINING only enlightened by the chef personally explaining all the dishes. 8 maybe 9 tables in the resteraunt. It is suffisticated Mexican sophisticated cuisine  but together with passion and love. NO QUESTION! Very delicate and we'll thought. Anyone who appreciates a good Pallet IT'S A MUST! My advice go on a weekday....fyi...They do lunch too
