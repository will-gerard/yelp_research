Hit or miss here. The first time I got a pedicure it was great. Tonight, pedi was okay and mani was awful. She didn't file them evenly and the cuticles were a mess and painful. Asked to leave midway through the manicure since she wasn't doing a decent job. They refunded me for the manicure, at least.

Great hotel and in the perfect location in the Esplanade and across the street from the Biltmore Fashion Park. The staff at this hotel are so incredibly friendly and always anticipating guest needs before being asked. The hotel is beautiful with marble floors and incredible chandeliers.  It has a very home-y feel and I just enjoy being here.

Amazing food, friendly service and a beautiful restaurant located in the Ritz-Carlton.  This restaurant has a great menu selection.  The Steak Au Poivre is an excellent classic!  There is live music on Saturday evenings in the lobby with an amazing pianist, Nicole Pesce and Jeffrey Hattrick.  Great place!

Best airport in the US and I have been to many!  It's so easy to get around and there is never a wait for curbside dropoff so you can show up 30 min before your boarding time and not worry!

Great store. Everyone who works there is very friendly and John is one of my favorites! I bought new tires here a few months ago and just recently stopped by to have the air in my tires check. Very fast service and you can make appointments online.

Went to the Dave Ramsay Financial Peace University at this location and it was a beautiful church.  All the people I have met who attend Scottsdale Bible are so nice and made me feel very welcome! I am looking forward to going back and attending a service this holiday season.

Great atmosphere and food but super slow service, pricey drinks, and sometimes you never receive your hookah. Idk if the new ownership knows how to run a smooth service. I miss the old staff and prompt happy service.  The good things... belly dancers are entertaining; when you do receive a hookah, it's great, the food is very good and fast once you get to order.  It's too bad they can't get the service to be a little better! Could be an amazing spot!

You can't find a better car wash for these incredible prices.  It's always a fast experience and I like how you can drive thru the car wash yourself. I actually look forward to my weekend car washes. Lol

I love Zipps because of their amazing zipparitas, focaccias, and overall fun place. There are tvs everywhere so you always have a good view of the game you want to watch. The patio is fantastic on a nice evening in the summer.

LOVE this place! I have been coming here for years normally around Thanksgiving through beginning of February.  The Christmas decor is AMAZING! This is a must-see place! They go all out with wrapping paper walls and thousands of lights everywhere.  It's always a good crowd of people, not like most typical Scottsdale bars, and the drinks are super cheap! You can't beat this place.  Recently I have been coming here more often and the people who work here are truly midwest-friendly.  LOL Check out the Coach House if you're in Scottsdale or just visiting. It's one of the oldest and most relaxed bars in Scottsdale!

This is definitely my favorite grocery store (Sunflower is a close second). All of their produce is very fresh, they carry amazingly beautiful flowers, and a unique wine selection with all being very affordable. Plus its always a quick visit and that's something I love.

Awesome new location.  I love the new Oregano's.  The food was great and our server was okay.  We celebrated a birthday and it is a great place for birthday parties.  I'll be back, I'm sure.

My favorite mall I've been to ever! There is a very diverse selection of stores and I love how beautiful its built. At night its really pretty and the food court has great choices like Blue Burrito, Pita Jungle, and Paradise Bakery. You'll definitely want to keep coming back after a visit here. :)

This place could be so great if they only would fix the damages that seem to be all over the mini golf course! That's the only reason I have come here besides hitting the driving range. Hope this place can make a complete 180 and doesn't close down however for now I'll stick to Top Golf since it's worth the money.

I love this health club!  I wish I lived closer as it's the nicest Village in AZ. There are so many great machines that can work just about anything and so much room so you aren't waiting to use a particular machine or elliptical.  It feels like "home" being there and everyone is so friendly.  Just like being around people you care about every single day.

I used to love this place but now service has gone down and the prices have risen. It used to be nice to get a pedi and gel manicure and not spend all day there. I didn't get my massage on my hands because she took too long trying to figure out how to shape my nails (that I ended up having to do myself). I am not planning on going back until it gets better. Bummer.

An okay place to get an outside wash but the inside isn't worth the extra money. The service here is not very good, either. I bought a groupon for three washes so the second time I had to use one I went to the location up north in Scottsdale and got way better results, both with the car cleanliness and service.

The live music was awesome and the singer came out into the crowd and made it such a fun experience! My first time there after the Oktoberfest festival and one of my friends loves this bar. I ordered nachos from a bartender who was super busy. It was slammed, I don't blame him, but he was a total jerk! I tried to ask him a question after we ordered and he just ran off to key it into the system. When he came back I told him that we were sitting at the table by the stage and asked if he could bring it over... said I tried to tell you before you ran off. He responded with, "no I can't. You can ask a server to bring it to you.". So I told him I tried to tell him before and then he said, I'll try. Just a total jerk... people don't need to be rude just cause they're busy. I've served many, many times and would never take my stress out on a guest. I told a server later what happened and she was really sweet and must have told her manager because he came over and apologized and said he would buy me nachos next time I came in. I told him, thanks but why not just comp them now since I never went to Chandler. He bought a round of shots for our table, instead. Definitely nothing there appealing to me to return. Especially with how rude that bartender was.

Great bar and I really like how its so different and so "home-y". The bag toss and jenga are fun to play or watch and the patio is huge. I have always had great, friendly service and the food is pretty delicious as well. My favorite item I've had there is the Chicken breakfast Burrito..... Now this is flavor heaven and worth the insane number of calories I can imagine it has. Yum!

I was on the holiday lights bus tour this past Sunday and it was so much fun!!!  There were about 8 of our friends on the bus and the drive was smooth (makes for easy drinking) and we brought Baileys to mix with the yummy hot chocolate and some other beverages to make the lights tour even more fun.  The first stop was pretty cool with the neighborhood decked out in lights and it was festive seeing so many other fans of holiday lights.  :)  The Mormon temple was amazing, as well, and the lights were just beautiful!  It was a cold night but a lot of fun.  There was Christmas music playing on the London Bus and Jon was so friendly, as always!  Great time and I'll be back on the bus again, very soon!

I've been getting monthly massages at this location since December 2010. I really love this Massage Envy, mostly because my masseuse, Jeni (or Jeni-Lynne) is amazing! I always leave feeling so relaxed and my back and neck feel like heaven. Highly recommend her. The rest of the staff is incredibly friendly and nice.

Kayla is an amazing yoga instructor. I have been there twice the past few weeks and she taught both classes. The studio is nice and small and same with the classes. They have the mats there for you to use which makes it very convenient plus it's located inside Spa Lamar so you can't help but feel "zen" when you're there. I can't wait to go back and am so glad to have found a great yoga studio!

I love this massage spa! A friend gave me one of her massages and this girl Victoria really did an amazing job. I plan to go back tomorrow night and am already feeling less stressed imagining how great I will feel once she is finished. They have great specials each month and the d√©cor is very calming and beautiful, just like you're at a spa at one of the beautiful resorts in Arizona. Highly recommend but be sure you find a massage therapist you like since I know that makes or breaks every experience.

Food was amazing, as usual, but service was so incredibly slow! They weren't even busy! I don't get why the service is so slow here. There were only 4 of us and our server seemed so stressed out and rushed the entire time, until we needed the check and then she took forever splitting it since she forgot we requested separate checks before ordering.  I will still come back because I love their food and they have great wine specials just wish the service was better!

This is a beautifully built outdoor mall with such an urban feel. The Quad has a fun water fountain area where children come to play and the adults can lounge in the chairs and sunbath. The luxurious iPic Theaters upstairs is a great choice for a nice night out with friends or a fun date night. Salt Lounge in iPic has these unique liquid nitrogen drinks (so cool how they look like they're smoking) and uses all fresh ingredients.  Tanzy next door has an amazing Sunday brunch with bottomless mimosas and a chef's pancake station. There's also a fantastic happy hour Monday thru Friday with awesome drink specials and a mobile carving station.  It's very unique!  Lululemon, Express, Kitty,H&M, Paper Source, Make Meaning, L'Occitane, West Elm, and Apple are some of the amazing retailers in the center.  There's also a popular Stingray Sushi with their busy outdoor bar area and the talented Dry Bar.  Overall, I love this center. All of the employees are friendly and it has a nice community feel, and that truly tops it off.

Not a fast drive thru service but the staff is pretty friendly.  There's a guy there who works the drive thru window and he makes great conversation while you wait for your drink.  IThe only negative thing is that they only sell plain bagels. I wish they had multigrain!

Hi, I've been going to this Greulich's location for a few months now and I have to say, they have the BEST customer service I've ever experienced with an automotive service shop! It's always very fast, very affordable, and the people who work there make you feel like family. In particular, Jim is hands-down the best manager I have met anywhere! He is so polite, informative, helpful and just takes great care of everyone who walks through the door! He's been great to me and that's why I keep coming back. I notice that he treats every customer like they are truly the best and that he is honored to work with them. I had a bad migraine last weekend when I was in and without asking, he lowered the tv sound and was very quiet during the hour I was there. When it was time to leave, he gave me an incredible deal on all the things that needed to be fixed and said he didn't want to bother me earlier because I told him I had a migraine! Now THAT is amazing customer service... Definitely highly recommend this company!

My friend heard about this place on that local show, Check Please. The food was alright. I ordered the crab cake sliders and a side of sweet potato fries. The fries were fine but the crab cakes were just eh. Not sure if they were overcooked or formerly frozen but just thin, dark patties.  It was a very cute restaurant but the server was equivalent to that you would receive at a fast food place or Denny's, I imagine, since it's been years since I went somewhere like that. She came up and said, "Are you ready to order?". No introduction, nothing, and came back twice more with the same question interrupting our conversation. I don't blame her since she looked like she was barely 18 years old and I didn't see a single true adult working there... it could be the lack of training. When service is bad and food is mediocre I never plan to return. Too bad since I was excited to try this place and the location is great.

I absolutely love this little restaurant! The crepes are spectacular and so freshly made. The service is tres bien! :) delicious coffee, fresh mimosas and cocktails, and just great ambiance. I hope this restaurant continues to do well and can expand into a larger space. I highly recommend and always leave this restaurant smiling because of the wonderful service and food!

Went there this past Sat for the first time with my boyfriend.  The food was AMAZING!!  Everything we had was delicious and it was hard not to eat more!  The crab stuffed peppers were beyond amazing and I cannot wait to go back for them.  Wish they had a few more pinot grigio selections but huge wine list which was nice.  The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating was because our server was very hard to understand with a heavy accent, spoke super fast and very quiet.  Wish he had taken a little more time to explain the menu when I told him it was our first time there.  Definitely will be back for the food and live music, though!

This is some delicious frozen yogurt! They even have a Salted Caramel flavor and wow, it is a little piece of heaven!! Definitely try it.   Also, I like how they have such an extensive selection of toppings. Everything from fresh kiwi and strawberries to sprinkles and nuts. Cute and convenient location, too.   There is tons of parking in that lot and it's really convenient!

Really love this theater!  I just saw The Nutcracker Ballet and Breaking Dawn: Part 2 and it was great both times.  The food and service is always great and I love how comfortable the seats are.  No other theater compares!  A new flatbread was added, the Firecracker Shrimp, and it's my new favorite!!  I'll definitely be back very soon!

I went to the location at Scottsdale Fashion Square and WOW it was awful!!! I asked specifically for a reflexology massage for 30 min and the salesman at the front door said, Yes yes we do that! Once I got in there this other man who didn't speak a word of English, so he says, started with my back and I told him feet and he said, Yes Yes. The entire 30 min he never got to my feet so I complained and the salesman from the front who I originally spoke with said, ten minutes more! And insisted I stay for ten more minutes for the foot massage. It was awful. Probably because the man didn't want to do a longer massage and I was not happy when it ended. I told the salesman that this was a joke and I would be complaining and he pretended at that point not to understand and kept smiling saying, We don't speak English. I am shocked this nice of a mall would have such a shady, manipulative business! DO NOT GO THERE!!!

Too bad they don't offer returns. The sales woman was helpful but only one type of strapless bra and she said I could return it in 30 days if I didn't like it. Then I saw a sign posted that said they don't ever allow refunds only store credit. Poor customer service to have such a strange store policy.

Great place and amazing prices. You can buy a pass for 9 or so visits and for the eyebrows it ends up saving you about $2 per visit. My talented waxer, Brooke, is fantastic. My brows always look so nice afterwards and I've been going to her for three years!

Gorgeously well built bar! I loved the dark wood and open feel. It was packed during happy hour and they offer a few drinks for a decent price (i believe it was $6 a drink) and all of their flatbreads are half off. I ordered the gorgonzola one and it had a very interesting flavor. It wasn't my favorite. The rest of the menu sounded divine so I do plan on coming back soon.

In the past I had some problems with this management company but recently they were amazing with renegotiating my renewal lease and have been more responsive to emails and haven't waited more than 3 days to respond.  Damon is the only one I have communicated with and he's easy to email with.  So thrilled that they have made this renegotiation so much smoother than other places have in the past.  Thanks, guys!

Between the amazing food and phenomenal service you can't go wrong. My friends each ordered an entree but I had dinner earlier in the night so just had chips and salsa. The portions were large and everything was priced reasonably. There was a musician present who played the guitar and sang and be really added to the evening. The restaurant is decorated very cute, as well, and you almost feel like you're in another country, which is a nice feeling! Definitely will be back!!

I went to The Gladly for happy hour last week and loved everything about it! I often go to Citizen Public House but finally made my way to see what The Gladly was all about. They have a great happy hour menu with lots of discounted items, makes it great for ordering many different things, and their wine selection for happy hour is great, as well. One of my friends ordered their happy hour cocktail and thought it was delicious. I have always been a big fan of the Original Chopped Salad so as soon as I sat down I ordered that, along with the Brussels sprouts and both were amazing! The vibe in The Gladly is very lively and lots of business people who work in the area and are ready to have some drinks. Definitely will be back very soon with more friends!

I really wish I could love this nail salon! The people are friendly, especially Joseph, and it's a great location but three out of four times I have come here I've had a not-so-great experience. The first time the gel polish started peeling after four days (that has never ever happened anywhere else), the second time, I had the woman use Essie polish and she put me under one of those gel heating lamps (thought it was odd) and the polish melted so Joseph had to redo it.... and this last time I got gel polish, again, hoping that first time was a fluke and two days later it started to peel from the cuticles! I don't think they can be using great quality if this happens. Sucks, cause I wanted to love this place but won't be going back. I rather pay more for a great job, always!

The food portions are quite large so it's nice to have leftovers or order a half sandwich and soup. I had a turkey sandwich on their fresh baked bread and it was great! The only suggestion I have is that they put more jam on it or extra on the side as it was a bit dry. The dessert case was incredibly delicious looking so I had to order a cheesecake brownie and it was worth the calories! Absolutely incredible tasting! The ambiance reminded me of a country store in Wisconsin. It was really cute and cozy!
