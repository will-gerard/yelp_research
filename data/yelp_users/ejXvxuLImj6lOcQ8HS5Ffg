Were super helpful, friendly, and fixed the alignment on my car quickly while I waiting (with a scheduled appt, I was not a walk-in). This is a family-run type place, and it was nice to see the names of everyone on that wall that worked there, accompanied by their photo and how many years they had worked there.

My absolute favorite veggie burger is at Hillstone! I also love the sushi, the thai roll is excellent. I always sit at the bar, and I highly recommend the margarita. Fresh squeezed fruit juices and good tequila - goes down real easy. The staff are always on their game, always professional and truly like getting to know you.

Today this review is based only on the customer service I experienced. I stopped in at 1:00 pm (4/2/15) to pick up lunch to-go. The cashier was a little rude right away, lacking anything close that resembles a personality. Coupled with her opened-mouth gum chewing, I wondered for a second if in fact Pete Carroll was taking my order.   As I recited my order to her with modifications, she just looked at me, rather than keying in those modifications. As she read my order back to me, she did not include anything I had just told her. I ended up repeating my order to her 2 more times, and when I got back to my office, surprise, surprise, my order was WRONG.  Seeing that her core job responsibilities include providing a positive customer experience through a cheery disposition and listening to customers relay their orders; I think perhaps this young woman would be better suited to bus tables until her attitude and desire to apply herself improves.  Wish I could provide her name for management, but rather than give me my receipt (she asked me if I wanted it, to which I replied 'yes') she threw it away right in front of me instead.  A real peach you got there.

Had a chicken parm sandwich on wheat bread for lunch. It was quite delicious! My meal tasted very fresh, and the bread has to be made fresh in-house, it was very good. I will absolutely be going back - a half sandwich is a very reasonable price.

Haven't been yet; so why the review?  Well... considering there are some very key things missing from their website, such as ADDRESS and CLASS SCHEDULE - how would I actually be able to go?  There are two addresses and two phone numbers listed on Yelp, which just adds to the confusion.  By process of elimination, I do know that the 480 area code number is the correct one.  However, when I called, I got a recording - so still no answer to my questions.    Marketing 101... have your address (how I can actually walk in the door) along with your class schedule and pricing (how I can actually spend money with you) prominently displayed on your website.    I was trying to help a friend who lives downtown find some RealRyder classes closer to him, since my spin studio is in the Biltmore - too bad I can't send him any information.  Or send you any business.

I absolutely love working out here.  I primarily go for the RealRyder spin classes.  I've taken a mat class or two; but what I absolutely crave are the intense spin classes - you know you are burning those calories!  I've gone to pretty much every spin instructor's class, I like them all.  Each of them are unique but either way, you get a great workout.  I've been wanting to try the WEightless class, I've heard really great things about it.    For newbies, I recommend trying it out for a few classes to see how you feel - more than likely, you'll become obsessed like the rest of us.  At that point, go buy spin shoes, they make all the difference in the world (rather than your normal cross trainers) - spin shoes snap into the pedals.    All the staff are extremely friendly - if you have questions or need help, don't be afraid to ask.  They truly want to make sure you have the best workout possible.

I really enjoyed Sochu House. Drinks (martinis) are phenomenal. You can order several different plates, tapas style, which was fun. At night it is like a night club, basically, but still laid back and chill.

I always get the sweet chipotle chicken grilled sandwich - love it. Staff is so helpful, cheerful and great. The baked potato spuds are AWESOME. This is one of my regular lunch spots.

I have been here three times and really enjoyed it each time. Recently they started doing a weekend brunch where you can select any entree and get unlimited mimosas. I had the chicken teriyaki, my friend had the salmon- both were great. I love happy hour and weekend special there - it's my after-church spot for sure.

I absolutely love MyPie. There is nothing better than being able to perfect and customize your pizza order exactly to your liking. Additionally, the fun staff behind the counter seem enthusiastic to help create your order - it certainly sets the mood for an enjoyable meal.   Customer service is top notch. A true example of going above and beyond to leave a positive, lasting impression on each and every customer. The last time I dined here, a small piece of my pizza fell off in the pizza oven. It really wasn't a huge deal; but the staff immediately created a new pizza and threw it in the oven - and THEN told me what happened. While my original pizza was perfectly fine (and absolutely delicious), they insisted on giving me one to go as well. Not necessary, but absolutely appreciated and impressive.  Great place to meet friends, take the family, or swing in by yourself. Everyone can order exactly what they want - so everybody's happy.
