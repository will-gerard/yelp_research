Finally, a chic and affordable Aveda salon in downtown Phoenix. Hooray! I love this place. The ladies at the front desk are SO warm and inviting - they're the kind of people who would make you forget all about your bad day. I trust Lilly with my waxes - she is friendly and very knowledgeable. I was scared for my first wax and asked her about a million questions, all of which she answered thoroughly and with patience. I haven't had a haircut here yet, but definitely plan on it.

I'll keep this short and simple. Why I recommend German Auto:  1) The BMW dealership said I had two oil leaks and charged me $800. Upon further inspection at German Auto, they found ONE oil leak and charged me a considerably lesser amount.  2) Rob is super friendly, helpful and trustworthy. He kept me informed about my car the entire time and was completely transparent about the work that it needed, almost going into too much detail and telling me things that I probably didn't need to know! :) Oh, and he remembered my name. I've been going to the same service adviser at BMW for 3 years and he still doesn't know my name. And whenever we chat, he tries to sell me crap I don't need. I don't trust him at all.  3) They washed my car AND cleaned the insides AND vacuumed my floor mats (well overdue. Gross, I know).  4) When I checked out with the cashier, I got a free mug!! Wahoo!   OK, so maybe I'm easily impressed but in all honesty, if you want to save a few hundred bucks and know what it feels like to trust your technician, then take your car to German Auto.

Lulu's Cupcakes are just as tasty as Sprinkles but without the pretension or cost. I ordered 20 cupcakes from Lulu's for a brunch that I recently hosted. Ordering on the phone was easy and fast. When I went to pick them up a couple of days later, they were packaged in nice and tight so as to quell any fear that they might smush in the car ride home.   The cost? $50, with more flavors than Sprinkles offers. (I had 15 varieties in my bunch.) Not to hate on Sprinkles, because I actually do love their cupcakes as well, but do you know what 20 cupcakes would have cost me there? Close to $90, I kid you not. And that's just not happening in this recession.

Nothing sticks out about Saketini that makes it great, so I'm not sure why the average rating is so high.  My friend and I got there on a Monday night around 5:45. The place was dark and practically empty. I started getting panicky that we would not get our orders in before happy hour ended at 6. The server came and brought us water at 5:50 and then didn't come back until right before 6. We made happy hour, but barely. I don't know why the server was taking her time - there was one other table so it's not like it was busy. Hate when people make me nervous.  Anyway, to the rolls. They have a huge list of specialty rolls, but 95 percent of them are deep-fried, baked, stuffed with cheap imitation crab or cali rolls. Only a few had fresh fish in them. So far, not impressed.   We ordered the spicy salmon and tuna, which were big, chunky and quite spicy. I was happy with these. I ordered a Dbacks specialty roll which was tasty but not amazing. My friend and I shared the Mermaid, which was half price after 6:30, and that was OK. Again, nothing to write home about. Specialty rolls range from $8-12, but they're stuffed with the cheap stuff, so I don't know if they're worth it.  In the end, we had 5 rolls, no drinks and the bill came out to $35, which, if the quality was superb, I would not have had a problem with. I don't think I'd go back, it just wasn't worth it.

We had our daughter's first birthday party here in the private room in the back, the Brewer's Reserve. From my very first correspondence with Derek, the catering manager, everything was professionally handled. I had to make changes to our menu a few times and they were very easy to work with. On the day of the party, everything was beautifully set up and the wait staff was great. And the food! It was all fantastic. Everyone was raving about it! We ordered the slider bar and they give you so much food. We had boxes of leftovers to take home and eat for days, even after I gave some to our neighbors. I would highly recommend this place for a private party.

We go 7 miles out of our way to take our dog here, that's how much we love it. We don't have him on any kind of schedule; we bring him once a month or so. I always call ahead to make sure they have room (I don't think you have to do this) and they always do. Not to mention, they always remember him. When we pull up into the parking lot, he's frantically trying to jump out of the car to get inside. He loves it so much and I wish we could take him three times a week, but that adds up. When we pick him up, they give us a report of how he did, and it's always positive. They keep the small and big dogs in separate areas -- and the small dogs, like mine, don't get shafted into a tiny play space. Their area is just as big with lots of room to run around. When it's really hot outside, outdoor time is limited and they are supervised 100% of the time. We love their work and customer service and only wished they were closer to our house.

I recently celebrated my bachelorette party here and David, the owner, made sure it was a night to remember. He had a section reserved just for our party of 10, with decorations and a customized menu that said "Happy Bachelorette Party, Mindy!" on it. The personal touches made the night feel extra special. :)   Then there was the top-notch service. David and his staff made sure we were well taken care of. The drinks never stopped flowing and the food was amaze! I've never tasted fresher spring rolls and the crab fried rice was phenomenal. I'm salivating just thinking about it and can't wait to go back with my husband-to-be and order it again.  After our meal, David brought out a complimentary shot for all of us (a special concoction he created himself) then got up on a chair so he could take a proper group photo from a good angle. He didn't like how the first picture turned out, so he had an employee dim the lights in our area so he could take a better photo! I'm so glad he did that because the photo turned out great and I'll have that memory in digital form forever.   He asked where were were headed next and we said we wanted to go to a bar to continue our shenanigans. He thought about it for a minute, then walked away. He came back a few minutes later with the owner of a bar a few doors down and introduced him to our group. The bar owner told us his bar was getting full and there was a 45 min wait at the door, but led us through the back door and gave us a big table right up front by the band. We felt like VIPs all night! It was a bachelorette party that I'll never forget!

Just awful. Bob drove all the way from Peoria to Chandler in rush hour to give me an in-home estimate and then he disappeared. I called him a couple of days later to follow-up and he gave me a quote over the phone. I liked his numbers, so I said sure, let's do this. He was supposed to send me a formal contract and proposal and he never did. I emailed him twice to follow-up and, what do you know, crickets.   If you don't want my money then why would you come out for an estimate? Thanks for wasting my time. I will make sure that everyone in my network knows to never go into business with this company. They're  flaky and unprofessional.

This place is utterly adorable. It oozes a vibe that is warm yet modern, chic but not hipster-chic, urban yet friendly. I went here last week with some friends for drinks and while the prices are about the same as you'd find anyplace else ($4-6 pints), the real draw to Main Ingredient is how cool and hip you feel hanging out here. I also like how they have Four Peaks Hefe on draft, as well as other interesting pours like the Avery White Rascal. Never heard of it before but I tried it and it was delicious!   I'm definitely planning on going back to try the food. The mac n' cheese looks amazing (and not just because we share a moniker) as well as the jalapeno cream cheese with crostini appetizer.

AWFUL experience. I too bought the Groupon and thought it was a deal too good to be true.  And, it is.  Sherene, the owner, was never there when I was, but assured me that her spray tan specialists were experts and would take care of me. Wrong!  With your Groupon, you get 3 spray tan sessions. The first time I went in, the girl barely sprayed me. I got a little bit of color, but not as much as I wanted. She said it would peak in 24 hours so I waited ... and nothing.   The second time I went in, another girl did my spray tan. I told her I wanted medium coverage, and for my legs to match my arms, which were slightly darker.   She botched my body! I look like an Oompa Loompa! I am so orange, I could be the Phoenix Suns' biggest fan. I went home and scrubbed off as much as I could. Now I have a little bit of color and it's under control.   Worst spray tan experience ever. I won't say the girl's name here because she was nice, but Sherene, if you read this, send me a note. This girl could really use more training.   I will not be back for my third and final tan.

I have called THREE times and left messages so I could schedule an appt. and redeem my Enamor deal. I'm still waiting for them to call me back ... but I doubt they will. I call during business hours and it always goes straight to voicemail. That's a little shady.   I paid for a service that I'm not receiving, which means I totally got screwed. I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone.

I needed to replace some sinks and I was in a time-crunch. I decided to call Freddy after reading his Yelp reviews and I'm so glad that I did. He showed up on time and was very courteous and professional. I didn't have time to go out and buy the new sinks and faucets, so he went and got them and brought back a receipt. He kept in communication with me the entire time so I knew what he needed to buy and he didn't make a purchase until I OK'd it. It took him about 2 hours to install two new sinks and they look great! Freddy really knows what he's talking about, and I'm happy to support his business.

I work on Mill so yesterday I decided to give Center Bistro a try. I got half of the Beet sandwich, which has carmelized beets and gorgonzola, and half of the Mill Revolution salad, which has dates and basil - so good! The service was also great. I asked the guy, who has strawberry blond hair and glasses, about a million questions about their menu and he was patient and helped me pick out my entrees. He encouraged me to sign up for their email blasts and pimped out their Twitter and FB pages to me. Good job.  I had such a great experience that I decided to go back today and try another half-sandwich/half-salad combo.  Big mistake.  I ordered the Red Bird, which is chicken with arugula, red onions, provolone and sun-dried tomato aioli.  But the sandwich I just ate had no arugula and I could barely taste an aioli. Also, it was pressed. The first time I went in they asked me if I wanted it cold or hot, but this time I guess I didn't get an option.  Not only that but the sandwich was tiny! I paid $8 for a nugget-sized sandwich and a bed full of greens. I hate when you order something and it comes out and it's minuscule and you're already thinking about what you're going to eat after to fulfill your hunger.   For my salad, I ordered the Southwest Fusion. The menu description: "organic field greens tossed with berries, candied pecans and feta cheese with raspberry chipotle vinaigrette."  Um, no.  Here is what was inside my salad: three small strawberries, NO candied pecans and it's swimming in dried cranberries that overpower the taste. The one good thing is the dressing, but this is not the salad I was promised.  Fail.  Now let's talk about the service. Like I said before, the first time I went in the gentleman with the light hair and glasses was very nice and professional. This time, though, I had another guy and his customer service skills were dismal. I bet they're probably college students, but that is no excuse for poor service.  For one, I ordered a very simple meal: half a sandwich and half a salad. No bells and whistles, no special requests. The guy behind me ordered a full sandwich, a couple of sides and a smoothie ... and his order was up before mine!!! WTF? I sat there waiting for a while before I finally went up and asked about the status of my order, to which he replied, "It's right here." It had been sitting on the table ready to go. My waiting spot was about 20 feet away, but I remained in eye sight the entire time. And there was ONE other person in the room besides me and she was on her laptop with headphones on. I guess with all those people in between us, it became too difficult for him to find me.   To top it all off, I come back to work, open up the box and ... no fork. Do you know how coveted forks are in my office? It's always the first utensil to go! Luckily, I was able to find one but still, come on, dude. To-go order = put a damn fork and a napkin in my box. I'm not asking for much.  I'm torn about how I feel about Center Bistro. My first experience was amazing, but my second one was hugely disappointing. I haven't decided yet if there will be a third time.

I cannot say enough great things about the team at The Art of Touch. I started getting weekly massages from them because my half-marathon training was wrecking havoc on my body. Christine and Tracy went right to work to soothe my achy muscles. They're professional, courteous and will focus more attention on trouble spots, if you have them. I requested deep-tissue work, but I'm sure if you wanted a massage for relaxation purposes, they would do an equally great job. They're intuitive and really know how to make you feel comfortable. If I'm in a chatty mood, they'll keep the conversation going. Other times, if I want to relax and just enjoy the massage, they stay mum.   I love their convenient downtown Phoenix location, which makes it super easy to swing by after work. (They're located in the historic Coe House on 4th Ave/Fillmore. Don't listen to people who say the area is shady, because it's not. There are people and cars and noise and traffic ... because you're in the CITY. It's not a scary neighborhood just because the homes and businesses aren't in new buildings.)   They don't pressure or heckle you to book another appointment but I loved their services so much, I booked three more massages! Christine, who's the owner, is so awesome and gave me a deal that I couldn't refuse. If you are looking for a masseuse in the downtown/central Phoenix area and want to support a local business with affordable prices, this is the place.

Wow, 2 spoonfuls of rice in my to-go order and an extremely hot panang curry when I asked for mild. I can't eat this, and I'm already back at work so I can't go return it.  I thought having competition nearby (Thai'd Up, Thai Elephant, Thai Hut), would make you work harder for my patronage. I guess not.

We used Boyd's for white plantation shutters in our house. He had the best quote out of the three vendors that we considered. I also like that I was supporting a local business. Boyd took measurements and recommended 4 inch shutters, which no other vendor even brought up so I had no idea they existed. Upon taking a walk around my block, I noticed everyone else had 4 inch shutters so his recommendation was spot on. He said the shutters would be done in 6-8 weeks so you can imagine the pleasant surprise when they were done ahead of time. They turned out beautifully and the installers were professional, prompt and courteous. I would recommend this company for anyone looking to install plantation shutters in their home.

Jenny's designs are cool, creative and inspired. Not only that, but I love working with her! She's professional, hardworking and precise - not to mention hilarious and so easy to work with. She listens to your needs and really gets to know who you are, so the designs reflect the best and most true version of you. I trust her creative eye and would recommend her to everyone.

We love CNT and I don't know what I would do without them. They are ALWAYS able to work with my weird schedule, which changes every so often. They hooked us up with the BEST nanny, who loves our child so much. My daughter actually cries when she leaves! They are a little more pricey than finding a nanny off care.com, but their back-up and on-call service is worth the peace of mind. I also like how all of their nannies have been background checked to a very high degree. I would trust anyone they sent to my house. They know what they're doing and have their business in great shape. If you're on the fence, take my word for it and give them a call. You won't regret it.

This review is for the Chandler location. We have been going to Musicology for about 6 months with my now-13 month daughter. She loves it! She is learning so much and the music is definitely helping with her development. Mary, the owner, was very accommodating and understanding when I had to switch classes a few times due to my schedule. All of the teachers are fantastic and you can tell they love what they do. It's such a loving and nurturing environment. My daughter looks forward to music class every week and it's such a joy to watch her thrive. It is a little costly, but so worth it.
