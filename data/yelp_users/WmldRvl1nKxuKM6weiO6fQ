"You don't need no teeth to eat our meat!" the slogan for Honey Bear's Bar-B-Q proudly proclaims and they are telling you the truth! Wonderfully tender and tasty pork, chicken and brisket that fall apart as you eat them in to an amborisa of meat and spicy sauce!  Honey Bear's has been a valley gem for decades, their original location a run building in Phoenix near Papago Park that you would never expect would house some of the finest barbecue this side of the Mississippi river. But the aroma would draw you in anyway.  That's how I first found them 20 some years ago, by smell while bicycling near Papago Park the wind brought the smells of the promise of smoked pork at it's finest. I was not disappointed then and never have been since.  Home of the hottest Hot Links around, Cowbro beans, Fried Catfish, Beef Brisket, Pulled Pork and Sweet Potato Pie.  Now Honey Bears has 4 valley locations, but success has not affected the wonderful quality of their food and their prices are the lowest anywhere for genuine slow smoked barbecue!

Bland, boring, uninteresting typical American Chinese food. Nothing to write home about.

The best sub sandwiches on the planet! No comparison at all. They're open late too so when we have a late night a tasty meal is not far away. Plus they deliver if you're in their range. Their subs are toasted and that makes them extra yummy. They use great ingredients and their bread is wonderful, especially their garlic-herb bread, it's delish! They also have a fine selection of made fresh daily desserts, the kind that will satisfy your munchies. An eclectic menu, fine friendly staff and a humorous decor combine to make Cheba Hut our favorite sub shop.

Wow, not what we were expecting at all. But that's a good thing. The restaurant would qualify as a "Dive" in most circles, a tiny 20 seat affair with recycled refer units as cabinets located in the corner of a strip mall with a 99 cent store and a BigLots. Not exactly a high-end neighborhood.  But after having heard of this little cafe in The New Times and finding that Phoenix Magazine rated their Ceviche and Shrimp salad as one of the Valley's top 50 dishes, we decided that we must give it a try! The article in New Times raved about something called a Pupusa and description sounded familiar, once we were there I realized why.  Every culture on earth seems to have developed some form of stuffed hand pie. You know the formula, a regional bread or pastry dough, formed into a pocket and stuffed with savory or sweet fillings. Food on the go. Well in El Salvador it's called a Pupusa, and they were delicious!  A kind of thick corn tortilla type bread, filled with several different types of  fillings, pork and cheese, beans, chicken and cheese, beef and cheese or beef, bean and cheese.  Now this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.  Don't expect to find the standard "Mexican Restaurant" re-fried beans here either. Spicy, flavourful and smooth, having been mashed right after cooking, they are among the best example of simple yet wonderful tastes you will experience here.  We had some of all of the different Pupusas offered on the menu which are priced very reasonable indeed, and were impressed with all of them, though the pork and cheese and the bean were my personal favorites.  We also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.  To finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of Crème Fraîche that was also a hit.  The owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.  As I've said the Ceviche and Shrimp salad is an award winner and the Carne Asada that the folks at the next table had ordered looked delicious. However I could not ask their opinion as they did not seem to speak English either and my Spanish is worse than terrible. But they seemed to be enjoying it, I'll give it a try next time.  They serve breakfast too and I can hardly wait to give that a try as well.  Stop in, you'll be glad you did.

I have never had anything but the very best food and service at NYPD Pizza. They have the most delicious pizza and calzones for a good price, slices and small calzones for lunch, and salads that are just amazing.  It is a small place, but that only increses the feeling that you're being taken care of by friends. I really do applaude the folks behind this little chain and hope that they will never sacrifice the high quality of their food.  If you like great pizza, I mean really great pizza, then you MUST give NYPD Pizza a try. You will be impressed I am sure.

A recent addition to our dining pantheon, Liberty Market has yet to serve us something we weren't impressed with. In the few months since they have been open, (October 2008), we have been back numerous times for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.  Their menu is still evolving and a few new items are added from time to time. This is a major plus for any restaurant keeping the choices changing and the menu fresh.  They have a wonderful selection of breakfast items and baked goods all with a bit of a twist to them that you are sure to enjoy.  Lunch and dinner feature pressed sandwichwes with fresh ingredents like arugula, basil, fontina and gorgonzolla cheese, balsamic viniger and some of the finest meats to be found on fresh made daily breads. Their wood fired pizza oven puts forth the best pies you'll find this side of Italy with a wonderful crust that is both crunchy and toothful.  The finest carrot cake around for dessert and truly fine coffee. Not to mention the best bowl of hot chocolate on the planet, made from scratch not a can of syrup. Yum!  You owe it to your self to give Liberty Market a try, your tounge and your tummy will thank you.

In this world of over-commercialised chain restaurants, bland clone food and depressingly similar menus it is a refreshing thing indeed to come across a place like Flancer's. Nothing fancy, no hughty attitudes, no faux ideals just really good food served by really friendly people plus some of the best music ever pressed in vinyl!  Sandwiches, salads, pizza and calzones along with wonderful wings and other things are really the entire menu. But the execution is flawless.  We have begun with Roasted Garlic Parmesan Bread and the Beer Battered Mozzerella Chees Triangles. Both are worth the trip. The bread is "Flancer's Bread" made fresh everyday right there. It is the same bread that all of Flancer's delightful sandwiches are served on and is so good that you won't leave any crusts behind. The cheese is a unique take on a bar food favorite and is served with a chipotle marinara sauce that was so good I wanted to poor it on everything.  The salads are all available in either small or large formats, but be warned; only the very hungry or an exhibishist eater is going to finish a large salad in one sitting. They are HUGE! We decided on small salads next time. But size is nothing without taste, and Flancer's salads are worth every penny. The "Tenderloin is the Night" salad is a wonderful creation with greens, marinaded roma tomatoes, crumbles of gorgonzola cheese, croutons and grilled beef tenderloin. Add in thier homemade gorgonzola dressing and you have art in a bowl.  The sandwiches are as varied as they are delicious,  the flagship is the Chile Verde Birdie, a turkey sandwich that knows no peer! Freshly roasted turkey breast sliced from the bone, provolone, lettuce, tomato and an out of this world New Mexican green chile mayo, on that awsomely tasty Flancer's Bread!  My personal favorite is the Parmesana Nirvana Chicken that is everything you would expect and then some. But here's a tip; ask you waiter to serve it with Flancer's chipotle marinara instaed of the regular marinara (which is wonderful, but I like the kick in the chipotle!) and you'll get a hot, cheesy, spicy delight of a sandwich. Extra napkins are highly recommended!  If you decide on fries you've made a wise choice as these seasoned crispy lovelys are on the list of best fries anyplace. Hot and tender with just a touch of spice, and unlike other sandwich shops they stay hot. (Or maybe we ate them so fast they didn't have time to get cold.) Either way they were great. Tip; ask for a side of Flancer's Gorgonzola Dressing to dip the fries in, I was surprised how much I enjoyed this!  We have not yet tried thier pizzas, but if the calzones are any indicator, (and they usually are), you'll never call Pizza Hut again! The calzone we had was the "Nice to Meat You" which is a carnivor's delight. Pepperoni, sausage, ham and ground beef with an extra helping of cheese! Serve with a side of marinara, (or even the chipotle marinara!) and you have enough food for 3 or 4 average people, or 2 really hungry ones! Wonderful!  Also found on the menu are a number of burgers, pasta dishes, soups and desserts. All of which we have not got to try yet, but we are patiently working through the menu and have found nothing to be disappointed in yet.  Truely it is wonderful to be saying "so long" to the rubberstamped restaurant clones of America and discovering little gems like Flancer's Cafe! Chain restaurants may be fine, but in these troubled economic times I do not want to receive "average" for my hard earned money. Why settle for bland when for the same price you can have "outstanding"?!  ****************************************************************************  Just after the beginning of 2009 the owner at Flancer's Cafe did something unprecedented in the land of small business, he LOWERED his prices!!! Even more oddly the portion sizes have not change one iota nor has the quality of the food changed, only his margin.   What a terrific thing to do for us customers in these lean financial times!

We have been searching for a Chinese restaurant of the caliber of Jade Empress since that palace to oriental cuisine closed more than 20 years ago and today we may have finally it. Yao Fine Chinese Cuisine was a wonderful experience, the staff was friendly, the food was outstanding and most importantly the prices were amazing! We started with egg rolls which were large, crispy and delicious without being greasy. The hot and sour soup was delicious without the sharp tang of vinegar that is true of so many other Chinese places. Yao serves a dish called General Chicken (Similar to General Tso Chicken) that is tender chicken served in a slightly sweet yet spicy sauce with crisp broccoli. It was a treat to be sure, but the dish that really was a hit was the Black Pepper Beef. Strips of tender beef cooked with chopped bell peppers, onion, jalapeno peppers, a delicious sauce all sprinkled with loads of fresh black pepper. Oh my! We enjoyed our meal immensely but it became twice as wonderful when the check came, Wow! Least expensive we've had out in quite some time. You really need to check them out.

Dirty glasses on the table that were fresh from the dish washer, water that tasted of day old coffee, "clean" coffee cups with wet stains in the bottom, seated at a dirty table, dirty flatware, flys everywhere, cold food and crappy service.  Any restaraunt can have a bad day, but this many things wrong all at once suggests deeper problems.  How can anyone actually like this place?!  Well, we will never go back and I suggest you think twice about going your self.

Now if you like Mexican food and you prefer it HOT, I mean seriously HOT, Five Alarm HOT, then my friend Los Dos Molinos in the answer to your prayers.   The food is wonderful, with combinations you'll find nowhere else. But seriously, did I mention it's hot? Oh and by the way, at Los Dos Molinos the green salsa is the HOT one not the red.  No light-weight type meals here, and on their whole menu I think there are only 2 or 3 items not marked as HOT. But it is amazing how well you can deal with the pain when the food is so incredible.  The place is a dive by any standards but well worth the trip. Try the Mexican Pizza, I dare you. Yes it's hot and yes it may take a while for your tastebuds to recover, but you will be addicted from the first bite!

This morning's target was Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. After all of the media hype over this little original were they going to be as good as promised?  We were thrilled to find that Matt's is very close to the Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central, so we took the train and didn't have to worry about finding a parking spot. A very good thing as it turns out as there are a few parking lots near Matt's but all of them were full.  I had heard that's Matt's was small, but I was not prepared for just how small. One car garage small. Including the kitchen! This causes a major problem for hungry customers, the wait was nearly two hours! Wow, this place must be great if people are willing to stand out in the rain for nearly two hours to get in.  Once we were inside and seated things actually moved pretty quickly. We actually had food inside of ten minutes of ordering. The only con inside I saw really was how loud it was. But hey, I could live with that.  The food was very good. My wife had the Chop and Chix, a lovely seasoned pork chop, eggs perfectly cooked, home style potatoes and toast. I had a Salami Scramble, three eggs, Molinari sopresseta, hash browns and toast. It was all very good, very flavorful.  However, after the hype and the nearly 2 hour wait to get in I was expecting outstanding not just very good. The other reality check item for Matt's was the price. I ordered a soda, $2.75, what I received was a 12oz can of soda. Yup, nearly twice the price of a six-pack of soda at any store in town for one can. A 4oz glass of orange juice, granted freshly squeezed, was also nearly $3.00. Hmmm, I didn't order any.   Total bill for our breakfast was $27.00 plus tip.  Bottom line? Matt's Big Breakfast has very good food, but only very good food. There was nothing exceptional here to justify all of the hype, there are many other breakfast places here in town with food at least as good if not better than Matt's for less money and without the marathon wait to get in.  If you go to Matt's expect to wait at least an hour, you will enjoy the food I promise. Only you can decide if the wait and the price are worth it.

What can I say? We have been coming to T. C. Eggington's for more than 10 years and are still as pleased today as that very first time.  A brunchery, T.C. Eggington's fare is consistantly high quality, tasty and filling. I believe they serve the finest hot cakes to be found anywhere as well as excellent omelets and wonderful salads and sandwiches. Combined with friendly service (a major component in a happy dining experience) and a relaxed atmosphere.  I cannot recommend T. C. Eggingtons highly enough. Please take the time for a nice leisurely visit. Be prepared though, they have such a strong following that there is frequently a wait to be seated even on weekdays, but your patience will be rewarded. Enjoy.

OK, so meat is not the only thing on Fogo E Brasa's menu but it is the star prefomer.  If you're going to go to Fogo E Brasa be sure to go hungry because once you're seated a non-stop parade of hot off the fire meats will be yours for the asking.  A Brazilian style of dinning, Fogo E Brasa is an all you can possibly eat restaurant that breaks the mold of the typical buffet. There is no menu, rather Fogo E Brasa is to be taken in stages or acts.   Act one is salad and appitizers and if you are not in the mood for meat this is an excellent choice. Pasta, eggplant and crab salads, seafood specialties like green mussels, or szechaun octopus, (which surprisingly to me I actually liked.), a wonderful black bean stew and tender and flavorful meat balls along with many other tidbits. You could make a lovely meal out of these items alone and in fact you can choose this option for only $9.97.  Act two though was worth the wait and the $18.00 price for all of the previously stated items plus the never ending stream of fresh from the fire meats, carved right at you table from short swords with sharp knives. Lunch featured six different meats, Top Sirloin, Tri-Tip, Prime Rib, Ham, Garlic Chicken and Portuguese Linguica sausages. All of them hot, cooked to perfection and as I said, carved tableside.  Dinner which begins after 3pm features different salad options and a total of sixteen different meats to choose from. Dinner costs about $10.00 more than lunch but still an excellent value.  Act three was dessert, but we didn't have room for any of the delicious looking goodies on the dessert cart.  The service is top notch and very friendly and we enjoyed luch very much. I can't wait to try their dinner selection. I highly recommend Fogo E Brasa to meat lovers everywhere.

Nothing beats good Barbecue and Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert is one of the best around. A wide selection of choice meats, smoked on site, delicious sides, home-made root beer and lemonade and a yard for the kids to play in make you feel like it's Sunday at Grandma's house.  It is difficult to describe our favorite menu item since everything is so wonderful. But the pulled pork and the hot links seem to grace my plate most often. We have yet to have a disappointing meal at Joe's Real BBQ and we have been eating here for 10 years!  Service is an order at the counter affair, but orders are prepared very rapidly and once you've ordered you are only moments from enjoying your meal.  The charm of the old building, the cheerfulness of the staff and the high quality of the food make Joe's Real BBQ a must visit for any barbecue lover and their entire family!

Cornwall native Dean Thomas had a major hit when he deciced to open The Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe, AZ. A wonderful collection of made from scratch pasties (say "Pass-Tee"), unique desserts and some of the best examples of the brewers arts to be found anywhere on this side of the pond.  Lunch or dinner will cost you less than $10.00 (without the beer) and the variety is a bit staggering. From the traditional Oggie with beef, onions, potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy, to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice, potatoes, lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying.  We have been visiting this hidden wonder for a couple of years now and have tried most of the items on the menu. (Except for the vegetarian pasties which we just have not gotten to yet.) It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite, they are all that good!  If you enjoy beer then Dean's selections will please you. Not a drab, tasteless lager in the bunch! Hoegaarden on draught as well as Guiness, Harp and Strongbow Cider plus a few others to keep a beer lover happy for a long time.  The current location is quite small however and it's proximity to ASU guarantees a packed house on Friday and Saturday nights. Happily, Dean is opening a second location in Mesa on Doson Rd. and Guadalupe Rd. that will not only be larger but has a more open environment as well. Opening has been announced for Saturday, January 17th 2009 and you can bet we'll be there.  Take the time to find The Cornish Pasty Co. you will come back again and again!

If this is what Chicago pizza really is, then I think it's time to move to the Windy City. While the pizza at Salerno's is not the best I have ever had it is certainly in the top 5. A crust that can actually support the weight of its ingredients and more of everything (except sauce and that's a good thing) than any pizza you can find in the Valley. If you can consume an entire Large pizza by your self from any other pizzeria in town then be sure to order a SMALL at Salerno's! I'd bet you would still have slices left over, I certainly did.  The restaurant is not high class by any stretch, it made me think it had opened in a rush only last week instead having been in place for 6 years! But that's ok, what it lacks in ambiance it makes up for in good food. The garlic bread is crispy and tasty, the Calzone which the menu says will serve 1-2 people, in reality could make a fine meal for 4 with out much problem.  The pizza benefited greatly from a touch of salty parm but that is really my own taste shining through.  While this is not the most inexpensive pizza in town it is without doubt one of the best, and certainly the finest example of Chicago Style to be found here.  We are looking forward to trying the veal and other wonderful sounding and looking Italian dishes on the menu.  Do your self a great favor and give Salerno's a try. It is worth the trip.

We loved it! Spicy, hot, flavourful and the "side dishes" are quite a treat. This is one of our favorite lunch spots with the folks from work. The prices are low, the people are very friendly, and the food is great!  What more could you ask for?  And when we go for lunch it is never a problem to get back to work on time, the service is so quick. You just have to remember that if you need a server they will not just be strolling by, you need to press the call button located on the wall by each table, then they are right there.  They are not open on Tuesdays, don't know why

Family owned, sold and bought back by the original owners! And were we glad to see that happen! The original/current owners are from Greece and many times you are the only person in the place that you can understand, but that's OK because Ginny treats you like you are her grand-child! She is just great and I'm glad she and her husband bought the place back.  My wife and I love to have the Gyro plate, which comes with a lovely salad of fresh greens and feta cheese. Our personal code word for this is a "Happy Meal" because it just makes your tummy so happy! The pita is always hot and fresh and is stuffed to overflowing with the most wonderful meat, a combination of lamb and beef, some onions and a dollop of tzatziki, YUM!  Our Happy Meal is often prefaced with freshly made hummus and warm pita bread, this in itself is worth the trip.  But the gyro is by no means the only thing they have gotten right, Zorba's has a lamb souvlaki that is just like you'll find in Greece! After having this for the first time I knew I had been eating far too little lamb. Wow!  A highlight is dessert, Ginny serves freshly made bakklava that will make you swoon! There are other desserts offered, but we've just never bothered.  The atmosphere is perhaps a bit too relaxed and there is an ongoing decoration upgrade going on. But everytime we go the place is nicer than the our previous visit, and Ginny more than makes up for it by being a wonderful person and a very attentive hostess.  The prices are still very reasonable, a gyro for lunch costs less or the same as a fast-food (yuck) meal everytime and your tounge and your tummy will much happier for it!

Alas, Ginny has had to sell Zorba's and the new owners still need to get their feet under them. Despite being told by them that the recipies had not changed nothing was the same. And that was a shame, because we loved Zorba's but it was Ginny that gave the place it's personality.  The food was not exactly flavourless, but not very good either and the prices have increased.  The Gyro was still full of meat, but for some reason they chose to put on so much tzatzki that the sandwich was actually soggy with it. The vegitable medly tasted like it was made with frozen and overcooked vegitables and everything tasted of peas. It was very disappointing.  Finally the service needs considerable polish as our waitress could not pronounce most items on the menu and was even unfamiliar with a Gyro and we had to point it out on the menu to her. Training should be better than this even if you have only been open two or three weeks. Also our waitress and the owner were at our table quite literally every couple of minutes. I know they are trying to be helpful but really it was quite annoying.  I think that Zorba's may become a decent Greek restaurant again, but it is going to require a great deal of work before that happens. We will give them 6 months and then try them again but right now I cannot recommend them to you.

Well I can hardly believe it but it's finally time to take Zorba's off the list of restaurants we enjoy dining at.  We went to Zorba's with the idea of a take out order of gyros and fries. The gyros were fair, the fries were terrible. Over cooked but limp with a burned flavour that was so objectionable I only ate a few.  But the last straw for me was the service. I asked a very simple thing; please put the tzaziki on the side. That's all, very simple. Not only did they not put the tzaziki on the side, they put on extra. So by the time we got our food home I had greasy burned fries and a soggy gyros.  That's all folks, I am done with Zorba's and I recommend that you not bother going yourself.

Gilbert based master restaurateur Joe Johnston, (Joe's Real BBQ, Liberty Market), invites you into his childhood home for some of the best food around. Located in Gilbert's Agritopia, (Ray Rd. just west of Higley Rd.), Joe's Farm Grill is a little slice of heaven.  Wide lawns, large shady trees pleanty of outdoor tables as well as seating inside create a relaxed environment that encourages you to relax and take it easy. A perfect picnic spot that just happens to have a perfect restaurant located at it's center.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner, this is a spot you want to bring everyone you know to help you enjoy it to the fullest.  We have only been a couple of times so far and have yet to manage to come out for Breakfast, but the burgers, sandwiches and grilled pizzas have so far proven to be excellent. And the onion rings are the best in the state!  Milkshake anyone? Because Joe's makes absolutely wonderful shakes and malts and the root beer float was so good you'll think you're 6 again at an old soda fountain with your friends.  Many of the farm fresh ingredents are grown right there on the Agritopia farm, literally going from the field to your plate. The burger was top drawer and cooked to perfection and the onion rings were a grand accompaniment though their fries and their sweet potato fries are just as good.  Nearly all of the menu is priced below $10.00 but there are some exeptions, but those exceptions are surely worth the price. Overall though the menu prices are very reasonable. Ordering is done at the counter where you are given a number and called when your order is ready. The process is very quick, despite the long line on our first visit we were enjoying our lunch much sooner than we expected.  I would highly recommend Joe's Farm Grill to anyone!

Have now managed to make it out for breakfast a couple of times and we were much pleased. The portions are good sized and the food delicious. There are so many choices that it will be impossible to describe here, suffice to say that everything was wonderful.  Not to mention the lovely park like private feeling picnic spots all around the building that really make my morning!  Huzzah! For breakfast at Joe's Farm Grill!

The feel of Lucille's Smokehouse is a typical version of a Louisiana bayou shack on steroids as viewed through the eyes of a Wall Street investment banker. Lots of kitch, but charming all the same.  The good news is that the food is really terrific! Southern barbecue and home style side dishes that make your tastebuds stand up and take notice. The selection is amazing as well with items like Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw, Southern Braised Green Beans and Creamy  Cheese Grits to please even a grits-hater like myself.  The barbecue is wonderful, with full smokey flavor and a nice selection os sauce styles to add if you wish. And they even know how to make REAL southern Sweet Tea without making it taste like tea flavored syrup.  Where Lucille's fails is that they themselves like their food far too much. All of their barbecue offerings are nearly $5.00 more than any place else in town. A dinner bill that for us would be about $35.00 else where cost more than $50.00 at Lucille's.  Bottom line is if you like really good barbecue and don't care how much you pay, come to Lucille's. Your tummy will thank you, even if your wallet doesn't.  *******************************************************************************  Not 24 hours after posting this review I received an e-mail from Brad the owner at Lucille's agreeing with me that they were a touch expensive. Saying that it is due to the quality of their meats and the size of their portions. (Which by the way are massive! Our meals at Lucille's are always great but always generate lots of left-overs too! Yum!)   I understand these reasons completely of course and wanted to assure all of you Yelpers that while prices may be a bit higher, the food is very much worth it. We keep Lucille's set aside for more special dinning since we cannot afford to go here too often.  I was so impressed by Brad's candor in his e-mail that I am adjusting our rating of Lucille's up one star! Thanks for the note Brad.

Had the buffet today and it was quite good. The curry was a bit mild but then it IS a buffet. The server assured me that the curry from the menu is available in differing heat levels and the proceeded to bring me a small copper pot fill with freshly made chili paste. That did the trick!  It is on a par with other Indian buffets in town but some of the offerings were standouts, the goat masala amoung them. The Naan was very good, toothful and with lots of garlic.  Service was pleasent, despite what some reviewers have said, and we were never wanting for anything. And not a single television to be seen! (This last is a major plus in my book.)  Overall I think you'll find the buffet at Guru Palace very enjoyable and you will be back again and again.

Don't go to Black Bear Diner unless you are really hungry! The portions here are some where between Lumberjack and Monster!  That being said, the food is wonderful! We have only been for breakfast so far, but their menu contains lots of delicious sounding options and if the pie tastes half as good as it looks I will be very happy indeed.  Let me tell you about what we know though. The manager very graciously brought us a sample of their Corned Beef Hash, as well as samples of nearly all their other breakfast meats! "Wow", says I, "how nice of him." But there is a method to his madness here as it conviced us to try some things we would not have ordinarily. (A mark I think of a confident restauranteur and an excellent host!) We decided on the Pattie Sausage and Eggs and the Chicken Fried Steak.  The sausage is hand made and in this case was a wonderful Italian seasoned hot sausage that has a wonderful flavor followed by a little kick of spice. Combined with eggs and Black Bear's own hashbrown potatoes, (The serving of which was large in the extreame!), made for a delighful meal.  The Chicken Fried Steak was both tender and flavorful with a lovely crispy texture. The gravy was delicious and lump free and was NOT out of a can! It was the by far the largest example of Chicke Fried Steak I had ever seen, and it too was served with hashbrown potatoes!  But just when you think this is more food than you can handle, then there are the biscuits! Huge square cut yeast biscuits that are soft, buttery, and wonderfully toasty tasting. Believe me when I tell you that one really is enough! They are HUGE!  And they are served with everything on the breakfast menu. Some of the best biscuits I have had this side of Georgia.  So if you're on a diet you might want to skip Black Bear Diner. But if you, like so many of us, enjoy being filled with flavorful, and interesting food then you will want to try the Black Bear Diner!

This small out of the way cafe suffers from many problems, not the least of which is an indenity crisis. It doesn't know whether it is an office, (the manager's desk is in the dining area.) a cafe, an ice cream parlor or a kitschy antique store.  The store had no real antiques, just the sort of craft work one generally finds at the swap mart.  The menu is that of a brunchery with french toast, omlettes, egg dishes and baked goods. Sounded good. Unfortunately the execusion is where this cafe fell flat.  The sausage and cheese omlette was obviously microwaved instead of being prepared in a pan on a stove, topped with a single slice of American processed pretend cheese. The french toast tasted very much like it was taken from the freezer and popped in a toaster.   Bacon and sausage were of the lowest order, the bacon being so thin you could have read the paper through it and possesing no actual flavor at all.  The promised "homemade" biscuits were such a disappointment that they went unfinished. I have had better biscuits at McDoanlds. Honestly, and McDonalds makes dreadful biscuits.  Overall we were extremely disappointed in this little cafe and became even more so when the check arrived. The total price for this disaster was almost the same as if we had gone to a real resturaunt  but without any thing that approches the satisfaction one gets from dining on good food. The waitress/cook/manager very cheerfully gave us discount coupons for our next visit, we left them sitting on the table.  The food was actually so disappointing and we ate so little of it that we  then went someplace else to have our breakfast.  If you're hungry and are thinking about stopping by The Apple Dumpling Cafe for a bite, I recommend McDoanlds, the food will be cheaper and NOT microwaved, and be moderately better tasting.  *******************************************************************************  Well, a few days after posting this review I received a meesage from an owner of Apple Dumpling Cafe and after due consideration I thought I'd add my response to that message here as well. I will use their statements then respond to them, promotional comments have been edited out. Also I should like to point out that the location we visited is now closed and they have a new location in Queen Creek.  ADC: "We have been in the Restaurant and catering for 25 years. Yes everyone has some off days. At Apple Dumplings, we cook everything up fresh, no cooking items and keeping them warm. Fresh eggs, not powdered or liquid eggs."  DBABH: Now between my wife and myself we also have nearly 20 years of restaurant experience, everything from family dining all the way up to 4 star restaurants. We know what good food tastes like, this wasn't it.  ADC: "Maybe you are not used to baked biscuits instead of warmed microwave ones."  DBABH: Being a native of the west I have had my share of delicious, tender and tasty biscuits from campsites to local restaurants and no, the biscuits at the Apple Dumpling Cafe do not qualify. They were of poor quality and neither tender nor tasty.  ADC: "Our business is growing in Queen Creek. Our Apple Burger has been called one of the best in the country by many."  DBABH: I am sure the business is growing and that is a good thing. But the new location is far enough out to discourage this reviewer from giving them a second chance at the apple. Perhaps if I were in Queen Creek one day for another reason I might stop in, but given the low quality of food we received on our first visit I think the odds of that happening are long indeed.

We've loved this little place for years.  Alas, on our last visit in March of '09 we discovered it was empty. Closed up tight and moved on. What a shame, we shall miss them.

NOT your everyday fast food Mexican restaurant! You will be pleasently surprised and find that you will return again and again to Tortas el Guero.  What the heck is a Torta you ask? It is a traditional sandwich on a lovely homemade style bread that they serve in several sizes from regular to a gargantuan creation suitible for small armies.  The menu is quite diverse, covering simple combinations that you have likely had someplace else to some that typical Americans will find truely unusual. The Cubana seems to be the favorite amongst the folk in my office, but the Pastor, (Spicy seasoned pork and pineapple), and the Chipotle Beef are also some of my own favorites. Rest assured though that they are all delicious and worth coming back for.  The tacos are smaller than you are used to seeing, but there are four of them on a plate and they contain any number of delicious offerings. A large selection of quesadillas are also offered and can be a meal all on their own.  There is a fresh "salsa bar" that has fresh cucmubers, seveal different hot sauces, pico, quacamole and fresh limes to bring even more flavour to your meal.  Everything on the menu is less than $9.00 with most of the tortas being $6.00 or less, so the value is very good. Atmosphere is, well, it's a sandwich shop so there really isn't much in the way of atmosphere. But hey, the food makes up for that!  Come by and give Tortas el Guero a try, you will enjoy it!

Such a shame but a sign of our times to be sure, this location of Tortas El Guero has closed it's doors. The locations in Phoenix and Mesa remain open and are still supplying us with delicious food!

I'm not sure what I was expecting when we went to Pastis the first time a few weeks ago, but what we found was a very pleasent surprise!Part deli, part cafe, and part grocery store and all wonderful.   The fare is a combination of dishes from the Eastern European nations that are slowly starting to appear here in America.Hot and cold sandwiches, pierogi, sausages, soups and salads, appetizer plates and the best crepes I have ever had. They do not serve alcohol just yet but they are working on it, so look for it in the future.  My personal fondness for spicy and flavourful sausages is satisfied here with wonderful Bratwurst, the "Budapest", (a lovely sandwich of grilled Hungarian sausage, provolone cheese, roasted peppers and a chipotle aioli sauce. Yum!), and Sudjuk sausage. (A spicy Slavic beef sausage served on a regional pita bread made fresh and served with hummus.)The Cobb salad was of considerable proportions and they even have selections for the little ones.  The grocery stocks a few snacks and beverages from several Eastern European countries and all that we've tried have been delightful.  They have just added a breakfast menu as well that sounds wonderful but we have not had the opportunity to try it yet.  I would recommned Pastis to anyone without hesitation, I hope you'll give it a try.

The long awaited second location finally open, Cornwall native Dean Thomas has another major hit on his hands! A wonderful collection of made from scratch pasties (say "Pass-Tee"), unique desserts and some of the best examples of the brewers arts to be found anywhere on this side of the pond.  Lunch or dinner will cost you less than $10.00 (without the beer) and the variety is a bit staggering. From the traditional Oggie with beef, onions, potatoes and rutabaga with a lovely red wine gravy, to the adventurous Lamb Vindaloo with basmati rice, potatoes, lamb and a wonderfully spicy vindaloo sauce all of Dean's creations are worth trying.We have been visiting this hidden wonder for a couple of years now and have tried most of the items on the menu. (Except for the vegetarian pasties which we just have not gotten to yet.) It is nearly impossible for me to pick a favorite, they are all that good!  If you enjoy beer then Dean's selections will please you. Not a drab, tasteless lager in the bunch! Hoegaarden on draught as well as Guinness, Harp and Strongbow Cider plus a few others to keep a beer lover happy for a long time.  With more room to seat folks, a nice bar/counter, outdoor seating (complete with an area for those that still smoke.) and TWO bathrooms the new Mesa location of the Cornish Pasty Co. is sure to be a huge success.  Take the time to stop by either location of The Cornish Pasty Co. you will come back again and again

I am embarassed that it has taken me so long to review this tiny treet in downtown Chandler. We have been eating here for quite some time and should have said something before.  As the name suggests, Chili Billy's has chili, but not your run of the mill chili oh no. The chili here is thick, somewhat spicy, and absolutely perfect on chili dog or burger. If you have ever been to the Los Angeles area and had a buger at the legendary Tommy's hamburgers then you know that they served the pinnacle of chili burgers in this universe. Except that Chilil Billy's is actually BETTER!  Prices are low, the food is fabulous and the place is a tiny hole-in-the-wall joint run by a man that know's what a Tommy's burger is like, he just makes it better. And I don't have to drive all the way to L.A. to get one. Do yourself and your tastebuds a favor and give Chili Billy's a try.

This is a tiny surprise in an otherwise unassuming Chandler strip mall. No, it's not the most beautiful locale but then decorations are NOT why we go to a restaurant. It's the food and the service, both of which at Thai Paradise are exceptional.  We have been to this lovely oasis several times now and have never had a bad experience. (Including the time I mistakenly ordered my Drunken Noodle "Thai Hot" which was wonderful if firey.) All of the curries are wonderful but Panag Curry stands out.  A broad menu with many different types of homemade dishes prepared with skill and love sets Thai Paradise apart from it's contemporaries. The lunch time specials include a lovely soup that is simple but that you find yourself wanting more of.  It is difficult to choose any one dish to praise here since all of the meals we've enjoyed here have been wonderful, with nothing tarnishing any of our visits. The owners are very friendly and only too happy to explain about anything on the menu.  All of their dishes can be ordered either mild, medium, hot or Thai Hot. This last should be dared only by true lovers of heat because while it never drowns the the flavors like at other Thai places it is intensely hot. I myself perfer the hot while my wife is pleased by the medium, truely everyone can enjoy Thai food with no fears of searing their lips shut.  Gather your friends together and visit Thai Paradise, you won't even remember it's in a strip mall, we never do.

Feeling under the weather? Thai Paradise's Curry Noodle Soup beats anybody's bowl of chicken soup for making you feel better. Yummy.

Joe was very nice and very professional. We had taken our car to the Honda dealer who had listed a large number of things that needed to be addressed and estimated a total repair cost of $3700. Could never do that. So since Greulich's is quite close to our house we decided to get a second opinion. Joe was very willing to give us a no cost estimate which was less than HALF what the Honda dealer quoted us. Moreover the one thing that the Honda dealer did repair, a broken engine mounting, was not repaired correctly and the other engine mounts were never inspected. If they had been they would have found the other damaged engine mount that had caused our problems. They fixed this and repaired all the other items on our list. Joe managed to discount the prices on the parts and on the labour involved on the repairs. He double checked with us a week after the repair to ensure we were happy with the results. We have been. You will be too.

Egads! We have been waiting for a good time to try Hibachi Grill Super Buffet, hoping to experience a new and tasty oriental buffet. We walked in tonight and were amazed at the huge number of buffet tables, Wow I though this is going to be good...  Problem is that this is not an oriental buffet. It is a buffet with some oriental style food like products displayed upon luke warm to cool buffet tables. Nothing, not one single thing had the look, feel or flavour of real food.  I know that buffet restaurants are designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but this place is working hard at reaching a new low and it's not even very inexpensive; 2 dinners and 2 sodas was $27.00!!! For this sort of money I can find real food all over this valley.  Do your self a favour, eat someplace else.  (Oh by the way; in Arizona in the middle of summer a restaurant really needs to have AIR CONDITIONING!! Not big groups of fans! Hibatchi Grill Super Buffet is NOT worth your time or money.)

A wait? Excellent service? Best biscuits ever? Are these people talking about the same place we visited? It hardly seems possible.  First, we went on a Saturday morning and were seated right away, there was no indication there might have been a wait and we were among 10 customers in the restaurant the entire time we were there.  Second, the service was adequate and that was all. I had to ask to have my glass of tea refilled, twice which is not a good sign in my book. While our server was friendly he seemed more interested in his cell phone, (we could see him standing by the kitchen window texting), than in checking on how we were enjoying our meal.  Third and most importantly the food was dreadful. The biscuit while large was neither flaky nor tasty but rather a baked blob of heavy dough. The omelet was over cooked and the filling items were stingy.  From the glowing reviews and beautiful pictures some people have posted about this place I was expecting good, hearty, flavourful food but alas an Egg McMuffin would have been more satisfying. We will never return to this establishment.  If you are hunting a wonderful brunch may I humbly suggest T.C. Eggington's in Mesa. Yes you will have a wait there but at least you will have 5 star service and food for your reward.

We really love Ike's massive selection of sandwiches! They have more sandwiches than any five sandwich shops combined and if you don't see what you want then just ask, chances are that they can make it for you. Be sure to try your sandwich on their Dutch Crunch bread, it's wonderfully different.  I personally am fond of the Count of Monte Chase-o nomnomnom.
