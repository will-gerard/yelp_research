I love this place! They give great services for the price. I got a mani and a pedi there and they were by far the cheapest, and the cleanest!! They take care of their clients. The best part, is they rememer you! it had been a while since I went there and they mentioned that to me. I will definately be going back there!

What a terrible nail salon. I came in with a gift card and they said they wouldn't take it because they have different owners. Then they offered me 50% of the value of the card. Um no. Someone paid full price for the gift card as a gift and I should receive the full amount. They didn't even try to accommodate me. Don't come here. There are amazing nail salons that give way way better service in the area!!

This is one of my favorite places to go with my family for some great authentic Mexican food. I have been coming here since I was a kid and have never been disappointed!  The always provide fresh salsa and chips, and the best bean burritos! One thing that can always improve is the service time. They can be a bit quicker on refills on drinks and chips and salsa. Otherwise, great food and service.

Wow! Service at is FINEST! They were quick, easy to work with, and they know there stuff! I had some challenges with two of my tires, and they not only provided great customer service, but fast service as well. My husband was also having issues with his tires and he took his vehicle to the dealership and one other automotive shop and they wanted to charge him a ton of money to fix it. We went to this Discount Tire and they fixed it and they were by far the cheapest! Come to this Discount Tire for great service!

What a great place! We went with a party of 9 tonight and had the best service. Chips and salsa were out quickly and the margaritas were on par. My favorite part of the meal were the fish tacos. They are amazing! The sauce on the tacos was delicious! Thanks for the great service and food! We will be back!

I absolutely love this store! My first experience was today and Karen helped me.  I needed a pair of black slacks and she pulled out 8 pair in my size for me to try on. It was great! After my purchase she gave me tons of free goodies for the baby and a juice for the road. I highly recommend this place! Can't wait to go back.

Wish I could give them a better rating. My Husband and I are big fans of Kona Grill- well not anymore. After spending $100 on dinner, the only thing that was not bad was the drinks, but how can you mess up beer from the tap? The service was okay, our waiter kept our waters full so that was good.   The Food? AWFUL. We first got the egg rolls, which were over cooked and dry, but ya know we are not too pick of eaters, so we ate them. Then Entrees were the WORST part. My Husband got the 'Po Boy, and I got my "normal" the steak flatbread. The Po Boy was made with soft shell crab, or so it says- well what my husband got was NOT crab, it was slimy, raw, and so gross. My flatbread, which I typically love was overcooked, and just hard to eat- it was like chomping on cardboard. We ate what we could, and left- because my husband is not the type to send food back.   The next day I decided to call and talk to management about it seeing that not only was the food awful, but my Husband was up all night with a stomach ache-  and this is a man who has a stomach of steel. The manager on duty explained that new management is on board, and they are trying to get business back----well serving what they did to us is doing opposite. They offered us a free appetizer- well thanks- but that is not worth the $100 we spent. They should have offered us our meals over, or a refund.   Needless to say, we will NOT be back- and I encourage anyone in the area to eat elsewhere, like Yard House or Mellow Mushroom.

Well. We were convinced to go back and give this place another try, and we were happy that we did. It looks as of they are under new management in the past few months and the service is back to to par as well as the food. Glad it's back up and rocking again!

I had the pleasure of working with Epic Web Solutions with my previous employer for several years and when I switched to my new company I highly recommended them- we started using them just a week or so ago and we have gotten more accomplished in this week that we have in months. A new email platform was successfully rolled out helping the company run much smoother. Their customer service and attention to detail are out of this world, and they get things done! I highly recommend these guys, I can't say enough great things about them. Next we will be hiring them for our SEO and online marketing management. I can't wait to see what they can do for us!

I had a great massage, and a not-so-great experience after with mis-communication when it came to their plan and membership fees and boy was I furious! I reached out to the manager and did not get the response I desired as a customer, and shortly after I spoke to the owner, Nelson. It was interesting because I must be honest and say I started with my hands up, defensive on what had happened. But by the end of the phone call, Nelson had not only made things right, but has helped me build an even better rapport with his company. I am proud to say that Elements Therapeutic Massage is even more than I expected, beyond the great massage--the fact that I received that great of service from the owner himself is hard to come by! Thanks Nelson for making things right, and honoring a customer. I promise I will be back! :)

From start to finish I was not a fan of this office. The front desk staff was short when booking, and pretty rude when I walked in. I had a few questions on the forms and they were snippy, which comes off quite unprofessional. The doctor walked in and asked if I had been there before. Even before introducing himself and should have known I was a new patient if he had looked at my chart. They removed a few moles and the doctor told me the results would be in to me in a week. As soon as he left, the nurse asked to stay In the room as I changed to finish her notes (unprofessional again) Then told me the timeframe will really be 2-3 weeks, WAY longer than what the doctor said. I would not recommend this office. There are way to many other dermatologist that care about patients and treat them professionally.

I know, you think school, and maybe think that these are just beginners when it comes to beauty and hair and nails, but that is not the case! I went in and got a pedicure. I thought what the heck it is close to my house why not try it out? and I was so pleased I did! Jamie, the technician who did my pedicure was amazing. She did a great job on my feet and made me feel so relaxed and welcomed. Then, my favorite part, nail designs! I swear she knew more nail designs than any other place I had been and so much cheaper of a cost to get it done! I got something new and creative and have had a ton of compliments! I highly recommend this school, and ask for Jamie, she is the best!

I LOVE this place! Great food, and GREAT service! I Have been here probably a dozen times, the food is always fresh and amazing, and the service is over the top. I have never had to wait longer then 10 minutes for a table! Great for a date, brunch with friends, and breakfast with family!   If you haven't tried this place, definitely worth your time to stop by when you can!

Great food and great service. This place seems to always have a good size crowd but never over crowded so getting your food is always quick and easy. This is a great place to come pick up a quick meal and a healthy one. Love this place! The Chicken Roll-ups are AMAZING!

Wow! What a great company. From calling to setting up the reservation to the day of the entire process was seamless. We changed the locations and the times and they were so easy. They also provided water and ice during our bus rental and the party bus was clean and seemed to be brand new! Jack was our driver for the day as we took a wine tasting trip to Sedona for the day. The driver was excellent. We felt safe the entire time and also helped us save time by rerouting when there were a few accidents and closures. I can't recommend these guys enough!

I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for quite sometime and boy was it worth it! The food and drinks were amazing. The concepts are so unique and I am in love with the ingredients. We had stuffed figs with prosciutto for our appetizer from the specials menu. The taste was amazing! My husband had the French dip which was cooked to perfection while I had the lamb burger which was also amazing! The staff and service was top notch and the ambiance is young and vibrant with live music on the weekends. We can't wait to go back!

This place is amazing. The sushi is always so fresh, and the service is top notch. Make sure to order the pickled wasabi for your sushi. It's amazing! Great place for date night!

Bought a gift card here for my husbands birthday and were so excited to go here on a date night on a Saturday night. We show up and there is literally no parking, we had to park on the street and walk up the hill to get there. My husband brought his own clubs, 2 irons and a driver to use. As we walk up, a rude employee stops to tell us that we cannot use any drivers tonight because "to many cars were getting hit in the casino parking lot". Then she proceeded to tell is we will have to walk back to our car to drop off the driver my husband had, apparently Not trusting him to have it in his possession. On top of that we would have to wait an hour! Sorry. We're not okay with spending $45.00 for poor service, long wait and going to a range to hit irons. It's called a DRIVING range for a reason. So disappointing and now I'm stuck with a gift card were not even looking forward to using.

What a wonderful place! It is such a trendy atmosphere and the staff were so friendly and knowledgable. We were helped By a gentlemen named Chris. He truly went above and beyond for our needs. We were getting a suit tailored which he pinned himself and also helped pick out the perfect shirt as well for the suit. Chris was so professional and caring. They really offer high quality products that come with a great price tag! I loved how the seamstress sits right up front where you can see her working. Such a great place. I can't recommend them enough!
