Love this place!!  One of the best dentist offices I have been to! The staff is super friendly and makes you feel at home.  You start out with a relaxing paraffin hand treatment in a massaging chair. It almost makes you forget you are at the dentist! My entire family has been here. My seven, ten and thirteen year old love it too.  Change your dentist today and you won't be disappointed!!

I was excited to try a new place in our neck of the woods. We went on a Thursday night and there were more servers than patrons at the time.  I heard they had Chicken and Waffles and thought I would give it a try. It is usually one of my favorite dishes. The waffle was semi warm on the outside but cold on the inside. I asked the waitress if they were homemade. At $13 for the plate I was sure hoping she would say yes. She said yes  but I couldn't figure out how a freshly cooked waffle could be cold on the inside. She brought me a new one. I managed to get a quarter of it down along with one chicken tender. For a $13  dish, I was not impressed. I could heat up an Eggo waffle and some chicken strips for less than $3 at home and save pocket the extra $10.  Not sure I will be back anytime soon.
