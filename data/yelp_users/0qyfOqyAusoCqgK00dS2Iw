Too bad you can't give Cox 0 stars. They have now forced customers to buy "mini boxes". The mini boxes do not work. I'm paying hundreds of dollars a month for services that aren't provided. Two months ago, I paid my bill on the Cox website. I received a confirmation email. Two days later they disconnected my service. When I called, I was told that I need to check MY bank account to make sure the payment worked on THEIR website because "they were having problems with the website". SERIOUSLY??  I'm so sick of the BS from these people.   The solution for the mini box problem is to send me a new one. Here's an idea- make sure your crap works before you force people to buy it. I urge everyone reading this to file a complaint with the AZ Attorney General's office. Cox is full of _____.

Love Chop Shop!!!!  Today at lunch my daughter got the wrong order.  The manager, Robbie, was so nice to us.  He immediately put in the new order with no questions asked. He made us feel like the customer really is important-he was awesome!!  I hope Chop Shop realizes how great he is!  We will continue to eat at Chop Shop as often as we can!

Jim S is right about 2 things- if you love second hand smoke, this is the place for you!!!  And Juan really is awesome.   There is no firewall, the place smells like a sewer and if you live on the first floor - good luck because people walk like 400 lb elephants above you.   It seems great from the outside but don't be fooled.

So happy to see Thai Basil open at PV Mall. We had dinner there last night and it was awesome!!!  The red curry is my favorite but everything was great, as was the service. I will be going there often.
