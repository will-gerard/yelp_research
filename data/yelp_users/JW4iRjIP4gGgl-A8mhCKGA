What can I say about Hodori, I love it, I'm annoyed, then I love it. I been coming here for a long time and it's time for a review.  Everyone knows that the service is not the BEST BUT the yummy food is what keeps me coming back. I even stop coming for a while because the service irritated me so much but here I am back. I have notice the service is so much better. You gotta know that this place is BUSY.....and that there are usually 2 or 3 servers for the whole restaurant so make sure your not in a rush or you will not enjoy your food. We usually get the tofu soup (spicy w/ egg) and lunch special spicy pork, lettuce wraps and go to town. My first bite makes me do a butt chair dance cause it's that good. So find out what makes you dance. ; ) Happy dancing !!!!

So decide to try this place on a whim and boy was it the biggest mistake of the day.  Walk in around  lunch time and  was greeted and seated right away.  My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken and I got the sweet and sour chicken.  The lunch specials come with the following egg drop soup / iceberg lettuce w/ ranch / an over cooked bland egg roll / cream cheese puff / brown white rice ( its supposed to be fried rice) and then the main dish.  Its a lot of food for $4.95 but its gross.  The orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken had so much breading that you really didn't know if it really  was chicken.  My daughter had to use the bathroom and it was dirty and we saw a roach on its back alive.  Also the lights are so dim in there that its hard to see.  Maybe they did that on purpose.  I would NEVER go back here again... Don't waste your money..... Panda's would have been a BETTER choice.  I left hungry and disappointed...

I really love this place. This is my second visit for lunch and man this place gets packed. The first time we beat the rush so the service was a little better. We sat at the counter  both times which is better during lunch if there are 2 in your party. It seems like you get your sushi faster.  We got a wash cloth the first time but not our second visit. I think it was too busy.  So far we have ordered the spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, unagi, tobiko, and soft shell crab (spider roll)  that's what they call it. The only item I didn't really like is the spider roll, I have tasted better.  I wish I live closer to here but I don't.

Wow pretty darn good. Kinda traveled far to eat here and I'm happy to say we were not disappointed.  Don't be quick to judge the outside of restaurant but head inside. When you walk in you will get a whiff of something delicious cooking in the back.  We ordered Thai tea and Jasmine ice tea which was ok. Then we got the egg rolls and shrimp rolls which was also good. Then of course Pho for 2. We both thought the Pho was pretty good and the broth was little on the sweet side but still delish.  Now after seeing all the picture of the macaroons I had to save room for them. I tried the taro with ice cream and plain and it was too sweet for me.  The service was great. Well if I'm in this part of town I will definitely be here eating again.

Great place to get gyros!!! It's a small place about 5 tables inside and cozy.  Our second time here and we left full and happy.  I got the gyro sandwich combo with the greek salad ($1) more but it's worth it.  My yobo got the gyro with the fries and my Jazzy got the jr version of the sandwich.  We tried the dolmas (veg) stuff grape leaves.  It was just ok, but not for me. I'm gonna be returning and try other things. See ya soon.

I am using my Groupon for this place and its not a great start. We were left standing at the  front door for a good 5 minutes. My pet peeve is that they see u standing there but wont say anything!!! WTH Come on people a simple we'll be right you goes a long way. I also checked on Yelp to get free guacamole which was cool but it was kinda bland, no flavor.  I got the carne adovada which came with beans and rice. Only the rice was flavorful. My yobo had the double stack chicken enchiladas (red sauce) with  the fried egg. His was good but the beans got no taste to them.  The most important  question is......Would I come back??? NO thanks I'll pass

Wow this location looks good inside and out since the renovations. It was looking bad. Had a early dinner with family and everything was really good.  Our waiter was excellent, drinks were refilled, the bread basket was kept full and the food came out hot.  The stuff mushrooms and shrimp cocktail was really good and our main entrees was also great..  We had the Rock Lobster / Sampler plate / Crab legs /  Broiled Trout / and the new Shrimp Sampler and a kids shrimp on the skewers.  Come check it out... The renovations made a BIG impact.

I've been coming here for years and I can't believe I never done a review. Anyways this is my go to Pho place. The service is speedy fast (almost too fast) and the pho will help you with what's ailing you. You must get the egg roll, it's soooo good. I want to try other things but I can't cause I gotta pho (it's that good).

My second time and I really like it. It's been clean quiet and the ac is nice and cool. You can get a small popcorn and small drink for 6$. Also if you got a harkins cup you can refill for a buck. I like that the seats are not cloth so your not all hot in the middle of movie.  It's only $7 for a show before 6pm.

Well I was wanting to feel like I was back home but was sadly disappointed.  First like Juli said in her review the two ladies are not very friendly they barely acknowledge you. There is no Aloha at Paradise. .  The utensils are so cheap that it will not cut anything.  We got the paradise special, kim chee soup, 2 Hawaiian Sun drinks, and 2 spam musubi  and my total was about 28$. The musubi was the best thing I ate there.  After 15 minutes my stomach wasn't happy.  ( you know what I mean)  Would I be back..... NO not worth the drive and hassle..... My search is still ongoing to find taste of home.

This the second time I tried this place I would have to say Never again... I really would like to Forget this place exist.  MY usual Pho place was closed and I needed Pho to help me recover from the night before... So here I went with my kids.  Walking in was pleasant We got greeted, seated, and menus in hand.  I didn't like that they did not give my son a menu, he can read his 13.  Anyways we started out with the egg rolls and I got  Pho with meat and  my son got the chicken breast with rice and a child's pho for my little girl.  When the egg rolls came I was like WTH really iceberg lettuce to wrap my egg rolls : ( . Not impressed . Then it took awhile for our soups and entree to come out and when it arrived... DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Now everybody should  know that the broth is what matters and it tasted like chicken/beef broth, the beansprouts and basil looked sad.  The basil looked like it was picked over. My sons chicken didn't look like a chicken breast.  It looked like they took half of the breast and half it again then smash it flat.  it was too sweet and uneatable. The service is good and the food is Phogettable.

I thought this place was easy on the wallet and I found out NO it's not. This place is too LOUD. I have to say that the service we received was good. The overall bill for 3 burgers 1 kids meal and 3 sodas was $45, that's a lot dough for me. Then I got to thinking damn I should have taken my kids to In and Out and still had 20 bucks left over. For me the value to what I ate wasn't there. But I have to say the server we got was great. Just not for me.

I wish they use fresh mushroom instead of can. We ordered half cheese and half monster but  the monster was loaded up and it made the bottom of the pizza soggy. Then the other pizza was sausage and mushroom (can) and pepperoni. That pizza was good but would have have be awesome with fresh mushrooms. I like the crust on the pizza it was crispy.  The guys at counter was nice and we didn't have any problems  like other yelpers.

This has gone thru some changes last time I've been here. Now you get metal silver ware and real plates but some how the food got worse. I got the # 7 green chili burro with rice and beans and a child's cheese crisp and my food was kinda gross!! The flour tortilla was not warm nor hot and the green chili looks like dog food.  The food is NOT good. Taco Bell is better than this place.

Went to try the lunch special today and was doing a "Happy Dance" in my chair.  I got the yellow curry with chicken # 3 with the spice level 7. And the curry was spicy and sweet at the same time. I loved it.  The egg roll was veggie ( just ok for me) but my Jazzy liked it.   I would defiantly go back for MORE...  Can't go wrong for $6.95 for lunch and its actually filling and Good !!!!

I was looking forward to checking out this place BUT I was VERY disappointed.... Went  on a Friday night with the family, the place was busy in the bar part of the restaurant.  Had to wait awhile before we were acknowledge and the girl server when asked about the beer selections did not know what they had at the bar.... We ordered the honey hot wings extra crispy which was the best thing of the meal.  It came with a side of ranch and two celery stalks. (see Picture) LOL .. I got a cheeseburger w/ bacon ( see Picture) and my son got  a hamburger w/ bacon. The burgers were bland and it came with SALTY fries.  My boyfriend got the pastrami.  Pastrami is salted when cured and added salt makes it very Salty.  It came to our table very SALTY.  Tried the cheese pizza from the kids menu for my 4 year old and it was bland and looked messy.  The cook added to much salt to our meal in the fries and sandwich.  The burgers had no flavor and  I will NOT be going back... Its not worth the price and irritation of a BAD meal.  The whiskey sour he had was also very weak for the price. Although the restaurant was clean and it look very nice in its renovated state that's the only reason it got a star.

I have to say I love jimmy john's....  I tried it when it first opened and I have to say that I am a regular.  Since I eat here so often I wish that they would  issue stamp cards so I can get a free sandwich...  = )  (hint, hint)  Oh well I'm sure I'll  be back... I always get the #9, its soo good. They make the sandwiches so fast and I heard that they deliver.

I wasn't impressed with this place... =( ... I finally got to try it with my son and daughter and it did not live up to its 5 stars.  I had the Giovanni Burger, son had the classic hot dog and kids hot dog meal and we shared the fries.  I think the best thing was the kids hot dog because there was NO special sauce.  Their sauce is Gross!!!! Its on the Giovanni burger / classic hot dog.  Its way to sweet the burger might have been ok if there was no sauce.  My teenager said "good hot dog if they didn't put the sauce on it." I agree!!!  And we use the yelp check in for the free dessert and I'm sorry to say that's not all that great either.  I might try later or not... Just remember  what ever you do DON'T get their special sauce on anything unless you like your food sweet.

Ok let me explain why I give this place 2 stars. Where do I start...... We sat at the bar and and the bartender was good came to get our drink order right away.  Now we didn't realize that the other bartender which looks and acts like a teenager was trying to get out of the dog house from his girlfriend because the whole time we were there he was trying to please her. It was annoying and distracting from my dinner. Now enough talking about the staff lets get to the good stuff or the lack of. We started with the tempura combo which was ok. It only had 2 shrimp and 4 pieces of random vegetable for $5. Then the sushi. We got the spicy tuna nigiri which look really weird, it looked like it had red food coloring and was really unappealing. Then the tuna nigiri and it needed the red food coloring because it was brown and looked old. Worried about getting sick I passed on that. We ordered another beer and there was no cold glass so I liked that "good" bartender actually got a glass iced it down and gave it to us. That is why I gave a extra star.  Now I had to laugh when I was paying my bill the "kid" asked if I wanted change from a $51tab when paying with a $100. Now I still left a good tip cause the other bartender actually was working. Would I go back?   Hmmmmm no thanks I've eaten way better sushi somewhere else.

Ok I used a Groupon and tried this place but totally not worth it.... We left HUNGRY after spending $40. Who leaves a restaurant hungry.  You know something's wrong if your doing that.  This is totally not like Genki's. Only 3 little skinny rolls are on a plate for spicy tuna for $2 and not spicy at all. I asked for tea thinking its green tea but I got a Lipton black tea bag. ( isn't this a Asian restaurant ) they should have green tea. So any way if you are a very lite eater or a child this place is perfect for you. The sushi guys don't interact with you at all even though we were sitting at the sushi bar ( if you can call it that ).

WOW!!!  Awesome food. We drove all the way from East Mesa for the sweet tea. We came in on Saturday for lunch. I got the Cobb salad with the apple cider dressing and it was Awesome!!!  It was actually packed and not fluff to look full. The sandwiches, nuggets and of the tea was YUMMY!! Yumm yumm.

I have been wanting to try this place for a really long time and I can say its Meh.  I was so excited but sadly disappointed.  First of all they don't have fountain drinks so  our drinks were from a can or plastic bottle. We  got the spicy pork (lunch) for $9.99, it was bland, lettuce wrap $5.99 but didn't get the chilli peppers, and 2 spicy tuna rolls. At first our waitress only put in for 1 order so we had to wait. The rolls were big and fat for $4.50 and worth the price. I love it when the tuna is still cold and the rice is slightly warm. That's the only thing that save Gogi from 1 star.  The spicy tuna was the BEST thing here.  I would ONLY come back for that.

Wanted to try some spicy chicken and I was every disappointed. The place was clean but the food was nothing to come back for. We got the 8 piece family meal with the biscuits and mash potatoes and an large mac and cheese.  I taste no spices or flavor in that chicken. You really don't get your money's worth and I will NOT be back.  We even had 2 pieces of chicken left and did not bring it home. That says it all!!!

Mmmmmm found this gem by mistake and it was pretty awesome. We had the mandoo, spicy pork belly, and spicy squid. Man it was soooooo good. The ban chan was ok. I didn't like the bean sprouts it smell like bleach.  The water tasted good. It seem filtered not like just from the tap.   The only think I would like to change is have lettuce wraps and lunch deals other then the specials of the day. We tried to order but our server didn't really know what we were talking about. And he comes and tells out they are out of lettuce. ; (.   I will definitely be back to try more dishes..........
