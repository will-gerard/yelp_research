Best breakfast in Scottsdale!! Just make sure you get there early because there is typically a wait. Servers are amazing and food is delicious! Can't beat the price and the food and beverage selection! Def recommend everyone to eat here. I always order the juevos rancheros because it's the bomb!!

I honestly have to say this is one of the best tracks I have ever played. I love the layout of the course. Pete dye did an amazing job creating this gem. Tight fairways, small greens, and great par 4's that you will remember forever! One of my favorite things about this course is the amazing customer service as well. Everyone is super friendly and you feel like a member when your walking around the place. The restaurant Is top notch as well. Huge portions for breakfast and lunch. I would def recommend everyone to play this course several times!

So I just moved back to tempe a few months ago and am lucky enough to live close this trader joe's! It's a great supermarket. There is such a great selection of fruits, fresh veggies, and meats. Also they have a wide collection of real juices that make it so much fun to shop. Deg recommend shopping here to all my #yelpers!

Was really looking forward to getting my fade haircut re done at Floyd's. I had grown out my hair since my last fade and showed up right at 9am. I asked for the best barber. I asked several question to make sure she knew what she was doing to my hair. She "acted" like she knew what she was doing and I went with it. 10 min later she finished my fade. My haircut looked so bad, uneven, and unprofessional. I didn't want to upset her and tell her I was not going to pay for this cut so I paid and left. I immediately left and went to Davens Barber shop on Apache and got my fade fixed. The barber there said that the barber at Floyd's should have her license redone and told me to go back and ask for a refund after showing them my fade. I would not recommend this place to anyone and will never go there again. It's not a real barber shop!

Have been to Thai Paradise 3 times! It's one of my favorite thai places I have eaten at. The owner is awesome. Very friendly and helpful. Every time I have been there I have never had an empty drink. He is great at refilling without asking. He also only uses fresh food prepared daily and makes the best green curry and tom kha I have ever eaten, even better than that "best thai food in tempe" place nearby and it's cheaper! Def recommend this place. Great service and great authentic Thai dishes!

First time eating here and I have to say this Chinese restaurant is absolutely delicious and authentic!! Service was great.  Lots of Chinese people here so you know it's a good spot to eat!   I ordered the beef meat pies (3) of them which were absolutely scrumptious. Juicy and very tasty. I also ordered the northern Chinese signature dish which was the spicy pig intestine! Wow I cant really describe how good this dish was. If your into this kind of food it hits the spot! I love menudo and this is the Chinese version which is fantastic. It's like the best of both worlds!!   Will be coming back again soon to try the dumplings and pit stickers!

So I recently had to go to's Verizon store to get my iPhone upgraded. I had called this store around 10am to see if they had an iPhone 6 plus and they did. I left work to purchase my new phone, trade in my other phone, and purchase some accessories. I need to be back to work as soon as possible and Pasha (Verizon rep) was able to take care of all of this in less than 20 min. Service was amazing, he really cared about my time, and made the whole transaction remarkably smooth. Would definitely go back to this Verizon store and ask for Pasha.

Absolutely amazing vape shop!! Great staff, friendly, helpful, and caring. If they don't know the answer they will get the answer!! Tried tons of different juices to build my flavor profile and juices range from low to hight on quality and price. Wide variety but the amount of premium juices they carry is amazing and they are cheaper than several in house juices in the area which advertise all "organic". Would highly recommend everyone to get their Vaping goodies here. Batteries, mods, tanks, coils, juices, ect... A+

Been wanting to try this place out for a while because I have have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant ever since I moved from New Mexico. To this day I still have not found a place that I can give 5 stars to yet.   I will say the food here was good. The refined beans were tasty, the Mexican rice had a great taste, and the hard shell taco plate with carnitas was alright. Couldn't really taste any seasoning on the carnitas but the shells were amazing and crunchy. If you enjoy cilantro you will love this place. Salsa is very very mild roasted green chili with cilantro that I would say gives the salsa its flavor. The green sauce at the two Mexican fast food joints near here are hotter.   Overall service was great, love the decorations inside, and the authentic spanish music that is played! Gives you a great vibe while eating and a feeling of being in Mexico!
