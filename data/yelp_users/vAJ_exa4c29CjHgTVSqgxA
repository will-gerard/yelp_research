So I know a lot of people who say if I could give this place zero stars I would...well I give it negative five. If you like 3 hour flight delays, long lines, and disgusting food this is the airline/airport for you. I figured like most it's cheaper , can't be that bad. Spend the extra cash and go to sky harbor. Waiting at the airport right now for a flight to Vegas. At this rate we could have driven there. What's worse is customer service does not care.

It actually ended up being a 5 hour delay. From Phoenix to Las Vegas!! We could have drove and it would have been quicker. Also was delayed coming back (currently waiting as I'm typing)

I have been to Scottsdale Beauty 3 or 4 times now to get hair blow outs and I've always had a great experience. Becca seems to always get my hair style exactly how I envision it to be. They have a "hair happy hour" from 4-7 where the blow outs are $20 and an additional 10 for adding a hot tool, which I think is a pretty reasonable price. The salon offers a glass of wine while you're getting pampered which is a plus! They also offer braiding and organic spray tanning too which I want to try soon too. I highly recommend Scottsdale Beauty Bar
