I go into the mall frequently, and I avoid helzberg every time! Their customer service is insulting and discriminating, I'm a 21 year old woman and I was wanting to purchase a pandora bracelet and 5 beads and I was waiting for someone to help me for about 45 minutes. I ended up leaving and very upset! I would never suggest that store to anyone!

I worked there for a very short time (1 month) and it was horrible!! They never paid me the agreed upon amount, the owner is very unprofessional, she yells at her employees, The place was beyond dirty, they don't clean, they never gave proper training,  they gave cake samples without washing their hands, they would lie to customers about when their dress is coming in so the owner wouldn't have to pay for shipping right away, and always rude to customers. I worked for David's bridal  for about 6 years, and retail for 5 years, and I've never worked with such rude and dishonest people. I would not and will not every step foot in this place and will never  suggest anyone to ever go in there. They don't do returns or exchanges, which I've never heard of before, and over changing so that you can wait till the last minute to order the dress is horrible!

This salon is beyond amazing! I love getting my nails done, but don't wanna pay unbelievable prices. Not only do they have great rates, they speak to you. I hate going to salons where they talk crap about you, this place is super friendly and they make you feel like a friend! I love it!

Well I use to like going to this salon..., I had a horrible experience with one of the nail techs there, I interrupted her tv show on her iPad when they told her to do my nails, she proceeded to not talk to me until she started drilling at my nail and drilled WAY to deep, she ended breaking my nail in half and told me that my nail was like that.... She was rude and unprofessional! I ended up getting my nails fixed a week later in Virginia, they said that my nail was looking really bad.. Needless to say, I won't be going back to this salon ever again

My first time coming here wasn't the most impressive. The service was very slow, the waitress was insulting me and flirting with my boyfriend, I ordered the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. The bottom of the cookie was completely burnt and I waited about 30 minutes for it. Needless to say, it'll take a lot for me and my boyfriend to come back...

I had a great experience with Blue sky parking, Tyler, and Glen were both very helpful and extremely friendly! I will definitely be using the blue sky parking again on my next trip!
