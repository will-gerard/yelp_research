I've been involved in ordering kegs from Top's for several months now, and I just had to get on and give them props.  The staff is friendly, they always have what we need, and they take care of us at the drop of a hat.  We wouldn't be the same without Top's and I would recommend them to anyone in the area!  :-)  Thanks Top's!  :-)

Great place to come to get eggs benedict as well as a variety of other tasty bkfst favorites!! The wait on a Sunday morning can be a bit long due to after church traffic...but it's well worth the wait, I feel.  The staff is friendly, the food is VERY yummy, and their service time is pretty quick, even with a full house.  We frequent this place quite often, and I felt it was finally time for a review.  I will say that the egg on my eggs benedict could have been a little runnier...but...with the stuff that's been going on with eggs lately, Ill pretend they were trying to do me a favor and keep me from being sick....rather than the chef just overcooked them.  Regardless, it was still very yummy, so I'm not upset.  Definitely recommend for breakfast!!  Haven't been for lunch or dinner OR pie, so I can't comment on those items!  :-)

This was my second time going to the culinary school's grab and go section...both times ordering an Egg Salad Sandwich, bag of chips and soda for only $3.50.  My first experience was GREAT and I was so excited to be able to get an Egg Salad sandwich anytime I wanted.....However, today's experience was not as grand.  What I was hoping to be an EGGcellent sammie, unfortunately tastes like TUNA!  I'm wondering if  someone forgot to rinse out the bowl in between making Tuna Salad and Egg Salad....or if the Egg Salad sandwich I had was cut with the Tuna Salad knife.   Either way.....it unfortunate.  I am very disappointed and am bummed.  :-(

This Wal-Mart is pretty cool I must say.  My first stop into it was the first morning we lived here!  We had just driven  from CA to AZ in two medium sized moving trucks...each with a dog in the front seat with us. We  needed ice for our ice chest (as we had no fridge at our new house until we unpacked the truck!) and a few other items!  Firstly, in CA, Wal-Marts are few and far between, and in SJ, CA there are 2 in the area, and they aren't in convenient places.  Here in AZ there are Wal-Marts EVERYWHERE!!!   They also have grocery stores inside them, as well as the standard Wal-Mart items...therefore making them a one-stop shop!  I use it primarily now for my grocery store.  The prices on their food items are almost unbeatable sometimes (i.e: a 96 fl. oz. bottle of "Great Value" apple juice is $1.97....as apposed to most places that sell a 64 fl. oz. bottle of "Tree Top" juice for $3-5.  They taste the same...and the price is just silly to pass up!)  As ashamed as some may be to even say "Wal-Mart," I have to say that for their grocery selection and the prices they offer on their "Great Value" brand...I would be silly to shop anywhere else for these items on a regular basis.  Their staff is friendly, the location I frequent has multiple "self check-out," lanes, and since I like to bag my own stuff so it's all organized when I get home...I go to these lanes most of the time.  They also have a McDonalds, which when in a crunch for lunch or a quick ice cream while shopping makes it nice.  I try to make sure I'm wearing a bra and don't have any pants on with writing across my rear.  I try to make sure my kid is clean, and that he is behaving appropriately in the store and I try as hard as possible for neither of us to be picking our noses in the store...to ensure our safe travels through the store and back to our home, without ending up on the "People of Walmart" website.  LOL  To sum it all up...if you're on a budget and you need quality items at decent prices, there's no need to be ashamed to visit Wal-Mart to fufill your shopping list.  You are being smart and spending your dollars wisely, keeping your family fed, and saving money!  :-)

This is the second time that I've worked with this place to store our relocating employees items for them, while they look for somewhere to live...and it's the second time, I've not felt the best about going there or leaving personal items there.  When I arrived the first time (several months back)  the onsite manager was out to lunch for waaaay longer than his sign said...and since the facility is approximately 15 miles from my office in Scottsdale....I didn't want to drive and come back so I waited (and that was just to sign the paperwork for the 5 units I wanted to reserve).  The manager had to re-do all the paperwork stating that the person over the phone had done it wrong...so on top of already waiting for the guy to return...I then had to wait for them to re-reserve the 5 units and do the ridiculous paperwork that goes along with it.  Everything went okay and there were no issues with the 4 folks' items that we had moved in there....but it is a sketchy neighborhood, and after hours, starts to get a little creepy feeling.  When I arrived last Thursday (12/23/10) to sign the papers for the incoming tenant...everything went smoothly...it was a different person working the desk that had his paperwork in order, and only required signature's and payment and I was out of there.  Today (12/29/10) however, when I arrived to meet the moving truck with all my fellow co-worker's personal item....we got the unit open....and the movers found POOP in the unit....and it wasn't Canine (not that that would be good either)!!!  Apparently this storage facility (and maybe all of them, who knows), is known to have squatters when the units are empty.  Unfortunately for me today, I ended up in one that had someone squat and leave a present....NOT COOL.  OF COURSE, the onsite manager was not there yet to discuss this with me (even though the sign on the door said they open at 9am....it was at least 9:45am before he showed up.)  Once I got his attention on the issue, he got to work with a shovel and cleaning supplies to make the area clean, so that my co-worker doesn't have any lingering smell or issues....but....REALLY?  One way to solve this might have been to go check the unit after someone reserves it to make sure it's clean. I reserved the unit LAST Thursday.....so you'd think someone would have time to come and make sure it was fit for move-in.  Regardless, this is the last time we will be using this facility...and for all future relocations will be finding another place that is in a better location, as well as one that provides proper customer service and cleans their facilities!!

After deciding last minute that we wanted a Photo Booth at our Company Holiday party....I hurried to Yelp, to find someone that could help!  I luckily ran across Snap Booth, and started working with Mike to get our party planned right then.  He was able to get me a contract right away....and I was able to turn around to him our company logo and approve the look of the photo sheet that Mike's design team had created same day....so that we were booked and ready to go within a day.  Mike arrived early, and prepared and was an Awesome host of the booth.  We ordered the prop package to go with the booth, so folks would have funny stuff to put on....and Mike watched as we all walked away from the booth, happy and giggling at the silliness we'd just created behind the black curtain!  This booth MADE our event.   If we hadn't had it...the party wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining....and the fact that Mike was so easy to work with and easy going while the party was going on....just made it all even better!!  Thank you SO MUCH Mike, for making this happen for us and helping to make our 2010 Holiday Party the best it could be!  I would recommend Snap Booth and Mike to anyone that's looking for a fun way to perk up your next event!  :-)

My little peanut has been going to Watch Me Grow for almost 1 year now (he started at 4 months old). All of the staff at Watch Me Grow is awesome!  They are very caring, fun, easy-going and  I look forward to bringing my little guy there for many more years to come.  Thanks so much to all the ladies in the Cuddlebugs room for taking such good care of our baby!  He enjoys coming to school and playing with his friends and teachers!  We couldn't ask for better!
