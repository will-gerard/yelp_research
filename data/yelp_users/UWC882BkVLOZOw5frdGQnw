I went there tonight & I'm impressed. The service was awesome & the food very tasty! I'll definitely go back soon with my family! Also the place is really cute & cozy

Food was just OK. Service was lousy. I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas. I should have stayed at work and eat my stuffers pizza & take a nap. Very dissapointed!!!!!!
