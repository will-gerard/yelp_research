The food was good. A bit spicy,. the chips and salsa oh plenty. Salsa a bit warm, but Im a grengo. Price somewhat high. Didn't have a lunch menu? All- in all would try again.

Good sandwich, bread was soft and I like soft rolls. My new friend Larry always greets you with a smile and a joke of the day. Simple dressing to your sandwich, Great teamwork from the staff.

Last time going there was a disappointment. It looks like they are cutting back on the meat slicing on the sandwich. 1 2 3 pieces of meat then move on to the condiments. If I'm going to pay for an$ 8.00 sandwich...WERE'S THE BEEF? Sorry Larry your a great guy, but give them a sandwich to come back for.

Moving to a new subway in PHX, The one off 75th Ave and Lower Buckeye, Small strip mall and less business , means food is fresh. It all about customer service. Still can't beat a $5.00 foot long.

What a disillusionment. I had heard good stuff about this deli. Ordered  Hot Pastrami  on a roll $6.99 w/chips. The bread must had been day old, the pastrami was cold and tough.  I did tell the cashier that this was my first time here. She did not mention that there was complimentary ,condiments and free Ice cream bar. I had to hear if for the dude that brought me that dry breaded pastrami sandwich. They do have pasta, what do you thing on that one?

Had the October fest Burger. Yes, really tasty.  Filling for a big guy like me. Steak Fry a bit salty, but OK Thanks  Rocky  Good suggestion.

Price was pretty high for a burger, fries and a drink. $8.00 and some change. The burger was good but I'm a big guy, thinking this is a snack for me. I can't see a family of 4 going there for less then $25.00 for lunch.

The last time I was there, They had the nerve to want to charge me for a to-go water for $.99 cent. F**** this place. I just got done dishing out $8.50 for lunch, then that was the icing on the cake.

Not much to say but they were short handed, Is that restaurants excuse for bad service?

Big Ass Burgers. Menu right to the point. Lots of TVs for your sports. Nice service. Back to the Brick tonight for Monday night wings. Have to say worth the $6.00 hands down. All the basic favors and got up to 10 to 12 pieces. Our new waitress Brenda is a down to earth gal who tells you like it is. She made it a point to make us feel welcome. If your in the area you'd be dumb for not stopping in. Keeping it real.

I think these burgers are overrated. By the time I got done ordering ( the # 1 and a extra cheeseburger) it was $  9.00

Lots of food, good selection. I'm a little leery of  Asian buffet's, but you get your dollars worth here.. fresh Sushi.  Mongolian wok made to order. Lunch price of $ 6.99. not bad.

Driving in my FDX area, had the chance to take my 2 favorite girls this place I eat allot.This is it. I think I made some points.You know when you go there allot and they call you be your first name. I heard the girls saying " yes that was good and yes that was good" So I think it was a good choosing on my part.  My girls were happy and they have a big selection of food for a good price.

It was nice to see that they survive the near shut down. It was nice to see a line of customers and the place busy again. The service was more upbeat and attentive. I ordered the burrito when it got to the end of the serving line was busting out the tortilla. Great to see your money's worth is back and the taste is back Thanks Chipotle I'm gald you didn't go out of business.

Got to say after a long time of not eating here, I must say the meals have been improved 100%. Still need to pay more attention to the order taking, but good to see you guys back in the game. Keep up the new image

This had to be the worst sandwich I had in a long time. The white bread was so dry you needed to drop it in water to get any moisture in my mouth after biting into it. And we're the beef?  You think paying almost $8.00 for a sandwich you'd have more then a thin layer of meat on the dryed out bun and coniments Really lettuce is a free food in my book. Do your self a favor check your sandwich before you leave.

The service was great, Your server always has a smile and great attitude. I'm been there a few times but waiting to write this review. It is a busy place on the weekends, so plan a 30 to 45 min wait during the peak hours. The nice thing is that while you wait, they do have coffee and water outside. Not a big place so it fills up fast. The menu is simple,but good food item to select. Priced in the $6.00 to $9.00 range, not bad price for the food served. The food is good with a twist on the basic egg and bacon & hash browns. They kick it up a bit with some interesting menu selections.  I'm a fan living in Gilbert, worth the drive.

I love this place for breakfast . I'm sorry to post this that I will shoot myself in the foot by this place is going be packed for MY BREAKFAST Time. The food is american with a Mexican twist. Plan on putting in some sit down time to talk to your people, the service is a little slow but it is worth the time. On a big party, good luck and have patience. The food is Great, Don't  play around with the cooks. Plus to and to this, Great job to the COOKS

I have seen a lot of food business come and go in this building but this place seems like a winner. The staff were very friendly and being a first timer there explained the way it works. I had the breakfast plate of eggs bacon and potatoes. It came will fruit or beans.. went with the fruit.. little weird it came out on a plastic plate with plastic fork but didnt take away from the good taste of the food. The price is what I think is spot on for what your getting. I do plan to return to try some other things on the menu. Don't forget to support local businesses

What a disappointment. $6.00 for a 2 piece combo that was a dry as the desert.  Take a bite take a drink, take a bite take a drink...so sad. Was so looking forward to a good piece of chicken.  The bisket and dirty rice was the only saving grace The service was fast and ask they handed me my to go box getting in the car thinking CHECK THE BOX. .if you get to go please put some utensils in the box. That was the first strike I hope I don't have a strike 2

It's hard to book an event or any kind of information from this place because no one answers the phone not a good thing when you're first starting out in business
