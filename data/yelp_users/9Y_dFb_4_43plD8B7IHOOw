This is quite possibly the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at in my life. I came here with my mom and as soon as I sat down I noticed that I had a dirty plate in front of me, ewwww! so I pushed it aside and asked for a new one.no biggy for now.I looked at the menu and noticed it wasnt that big at all and everything was around $14-$18 a dish so it better be good right! Well I ordered the veal piccata.....big mistake! it came with 3 flattened medallions of veal and spaghetti with an olive oil and garlic sauce, The veal was horrible it had no taste to it and what taste it did have wasnt good.It was way overcooked to the point that I could hardly even cut it. usually you would serve angel hair pasta with piccata but whatever it just didnt work at all the whole dish just looked sloppy and was swimming in sauce that should have been rendered much much further.the bread they served on the side was horrible and tasteless much like the rest of the meal, and the whole olive oil and parm thing was just nasty I mean come on people we know its the stuff out of the can! had to ask for balsamic for the bread to give it some flavor which the balsamic should be on the table in the first place.the waiter added drinks to our bill that we didnt get and I dont know if they do this all the time but he put down an automatic 18 percent tip for himself.......usually thats for parties over 6 right? I dont get that one but I dont think its right.and for the people that have given good reviews on this place dont trust them, im sure they are either employees or family because this place is disgusting!

went to this location a few months ago with the hubby and kiddos,when we walked in the hostess snubbed us since we came in an hour before closing Im guessing! But anyways I gave this place 1 star because I couldnt give it 0, My husband ordered a steak and it was so full of gristle, fat and nerves that on his second bite he started to choke,I totally freaked out and he tried to drink some water and it couldnt go down his throat so he threw it up all over his plate and food,now the steak slipped down a bit so he could breath but it was still lodged there so he was in alot of pain and he kept trowing up.anyways the waitresses were just standing around watching the whole time and after the worst was over they came over and were like are you ok? to my husband.....no im not ok and i need to go to the hospital! the waitress was like ok and she actually went and got our CHECK! like are you kidding me? we just got our food and took a few bites and my hubby chokes on the food you served him and now you want us to pay for it before we rush to the hospital? so the hubby and kids went to the car and I was so mad I just paid and ran out...no manager no nothing. got hubbs to the er and they had to give him some shot to let the steak pass through this throat...you could actually see the lump in his throat! needless to say we wrote a letter to the corporate office and what did they do? oh they sent us a letter saying sorry! will never go here again.......EVER!

Yeah so the fam and I were looking for a new pizza place and we came upon Brothers Pizza....ummm yeah Im not gonna beat around the bush on this one, DO NOT go here it was the worst pizza ive EVER had in my life, Im not even sure that what I was eating was pizza because it sure didnt taste like it,the wings were just ok but the mild "sauce" was more like mild oil! As soon as the hubby brought the pizza out to the car I knew there was something wrong because it smelled really wierd..not like pizza smells,The cheese is horrible im not sure if it is cheese or what it was but it didnt taste like cheese and it was like lumpy, gross! we asked for 1/4 peperoni because the hubby doesnt eat pork and I do so I always get a few pieces with peperoni on it,but they gave us 1/2 peperoni so my hubby couldnt even eat that much.....not that he wanted to anyways! I will never go back here again and I dont know why any of these other people gave good reviews for this place, they eirther have never had pizza before in their lives or they are on crack....take your pick!

This place willl always have a place in my heart, My husband took me here on our first date and it was amazing, Im only 25 and was a single mother of 2 at the time so I rarely got out and especially anywhere fancy, I was a bit uncomfortable but it was nice to be waited on and they make you feel very special.The bill was about 200 I think for the both of us wowza! The food was great I didnt have a problem with anything and the steak was perfect,the second time we went was right after my hubby asked me to marry him atop the mountain to the northeast of the steakhouse, still amazing and this time I got the creme brulee for dessert OMG so delicious! actually the first time ive ever had it but dont think anything can get better than that! I got steak again with mashed potatoes asparagus and baby carrots so yummy! I would recommend only going here for a special occasion because its so pricey unless your rich I guess. the service is great and very attentive, after we paid our bill and walked out our waiter ran outside to find us and shake our hands and give us his card,pretty sure he was happy about the huge tip my hubby gave him lol! then the valet,made me feel wierd the first time I was laughing and thinking dude im not some rich snob that cant even open their own door,but what are you gonna do they do it anyways.Overall great place to feel special and get a great meal but be prepared to shell out loads of cash, I would say bring 400 for 2 people just in case you have a date that orders alot of wine or drinks,the 200 for me and the hubby was without drinks, tip to waiter,and tip to valet.

So I go shopping one day at my local walmart in el mirage, do all my shopping with my kiddos and come outside, I get to my suv and realize that there is a HUGE dent in the back and I mean HUGE! so I was like what the F man and run back inside to tell them,waiting,waiting,waiting, finally I get to talk to someone and they tell me there is nothing the store can do so he says go talk to the security officer that drives around the parking lot so I do that meanwhile im still running around with my kids and a cart full of groceries,so i find this guy and he pretty much looks at my car and said there is nothing we can do about this......really dude? you cant call the cops?,you cant look at the video to see if you can Id the car that hit mine? you cant do anything? what are the cameras for? just in case someone hits something of yours? who gives a poo about the customers! I will never go back here again.

So I was reading through the reviews of this place and I see that they are a bit dated so im going to update a few things for you guys! They now let you get your own utensils and plates instead of giving them to you when you pay.Yes it is crowded but hey its good and cheap come on now! And yes there are alot of kids running around but I dont really mind it all that much since I have two kids of my own.....now dont think that im letting my kids run around this place because Im a better parent that that! The food is good,I really dont see a problem with it at all! I really dont care where things are located on the buffet line as along as they are there im happy and I dont mind walking a few feet to get my salad! The rolls are amazing with the honey butter and I cant get enough of them. And a tip....wear something warm,they crank up the ac so its freezing in there....pretty sure they do it to make people leave quicker! I have had one bad waitress here and we told the manager about it,they ended up giving us a whole box of fresh buns and honey butter to go! yum! so as long as the food is good and they dont have flies in their food which happened to me last week at souper salad then im a fan!

Went to see a movie with the hubby today and decided to stop and get some lunch before,we had a choice between the sandbar and blu burger, I made the wrong choice! Dont get me wrong ive been to the sandbar at night on the weekend and I loved it but I didnt eat anything those times and frankly I didnt even know they served food during the day.Anyways so we show up and its kind of weird looking around this place while its light outside! But we are seated at a booth by the kitchen.....I hate sitting by the kitchen! not because I think im better than anyone else but because I dont like people looking at me when I eat, I usually have food falling out of my mouth or something when the servers look at me lol.I ordered the chicken chimi and the hubby ordered a steak burrito, they both came with rice and beans, I thought we would get some chips and salsa to munch on but that didnt happen,the drink glasses are big so you dont have to get a million refills.when our food arrived I looked at it and knew it was going to be horrible.the chimi had no sauce on it and just a little bit of melted mozzarella cheese on top....mozzarella on mexican food? then I looked at the rice and laughed,the rice they use is like the lipton mexican rice you get in the grocery store,I actually think thats what they use! the beans were flavorless and had more mozzarella cheese on them, come on people! the chimi was ok,not very much flavor and not very good.Now there are mexicans cooking this food I wonder what they think about this.the hubby liked his burrito though......not much coming from him though because he liked the rice! my hubby is a total white boy and im guessing thats why he liked it! Now im white also but I lived with a mexican family for 6 years so I know what REAL mexican food is and that  is what I expect when I go to a mexican restaurant,That didnt happen here and I will never go back here.....to eat that is!  so if you like totally Americanized mexican restaurants you may like the sandbar but if you actually know what real mexican food looks and tastes like your going to be very very disappointed with this place!

Horrible! my husband and I decided to eat here since I am from NY and he is from MD, we both love NY style pizza.........which this is not! it looked good when it came to the table but as soon as I took a bite I was very dissapointed, we got 2 small pizzas first was a pizza with red sauce cheese and shrooms and the second was a white margherita pizza, the red sauce has absolutely no flavor to it, I mean NO flavor it tasted like water seriously! the white pizza was the better place of the two but still wasnt worth what we paid. its expensive for what it is and the topping are priced way to high between 2-4 dollars per topping. the only thing I can say good about this place is that the cheesecake is made fresh in house and is very good, I got a strawberry cheesecake and hubby got the oreo which he and  I both loved,the strawberry actually has strawberries in the mix its not on top like most others. I would never go back for the pizza but if I was in the area and wanted cheesecake I would stop in and get it to go. Oh and when hubby and I walked into this place there was about 5 servers or whoever just standing there in a group talking,but when we walked in they just stared at us as we walked to our table,didnt say anything just stared it was really awkward!!!!

I have to say that I absolutely LOVE this place, At first I was afraid to go there because of its location (stuffed between a couple run down stores) not the best looking on the outside, But my husband went for lunch one day and was raving about it so I had to go. We ordered the Bulgogi to share which come on a bed of onions with bowls of rice on the side and a couple california rolls, our check usually is in the $40 range with just soda to drink. also you get a bowl of miso soup after you arrive which is delicious! Ive also tried the "fried tofu" which is an app. and thats ehhh not bad but not a whole lot of flavor to it. there is another one that I love,cant think of the name but its pretty much chicken on a stick over a bed of cabbage with a wonderful sauce which is also an app. I would have given this place 5 stars but im cheap and I like a cheap meal! If you havent gone already you need to go :)

My family and I visited this location tonight because I wanted some sushi.We walk inside and there was no wait,we decided to not sit at one of the grills so they sat us in a corner 1/2 booth 1/2 table....i mean really in the corner totally away from anyone else! I felt like I was being punished or something, I opened the menu and was shocked by the prices,really over $10 for a kids meal? I wanted to get up and leave right away but I didnt....big mistake! Our waitress came over and I couldnt understand a thing she said,I just said iced tea! she came with our drinks and took our order,I ordered the filet mignon(which said it was comparable to kobe beef) and the hubby ordered the "steak" ......ok it just said steak nothing else.the kids both ordered the steak as well,we also got a crunchy california roll and a volcano roll.our miso soup came out and was ok but ive had better,the "salad" was iceberg lettuce with a half slice of tomato on top...not so good! the rolls came out and I liked mine which was the cali roll but they put a sauce on top which I didnt like,the volcano roll was soooo disgusting! hubby ordered it so im not sure exactly what was in it but it has cooked salmon wrapped around it,I ate one and almost threw up,it took all my strength not to.our food comes out,we all had the same exact food on our plates,"steak" mixed veggies,and a mound of fried rice. the steak was cubed and tasteless,I tried both my hubbys steak and mine and couldnt tell the difference,no wonder they give you 2 different sauces....you will need them! The veggies included onions,carrots,broccoli and zucchini there was more seasoning on them than on the "steak".The rice was by far the worst thing there,it didnt taste like fried rice and seriously didnt even taste like rice! I dont know what was going on there but whatever! my kids only ate the steak and some veggies they also hated the rice,my husband ate everything after took all of our sauces and pored it onto his plate.the bill came to $110 and I didnt even want to leave a tip but im not that horrible,I couldnt understand anything the waitress said,she hardly came over to our table since all of her other tables were on the other side of the room and she was busy with them most of the time.If I spend $30 for a plate I expect much more than what I got here and will never go back. At least dont cube our steak...I wonder what it looked like before they cooked it! I hope you see this before you try to go here,I made the mistake of not checking yelp before I went and learned my lesson!

Great burger place,went there tonight with my family and was very pleased with the food as well as the service, the buns are very tasty also. I got the california burger which was cooked perfectly and juicy.the herb mayo is yummy and love how they put mixed field greens atop the burger instead of some romain or iceburg lettuce. they have a kids menu which I didnt know before we went but was pleased when they brought a couple out for the kids with crayons,the hubby got a BYOB burger which is build your own burger, he got a bunch of toppings and the waitress even pointed out after we got our food that he didnt get a sauce so she went and got him some chipotle mayo which he liked alot. the kids menu consists of chicken fingers,grilled cheese,mini burger,or pb&j all with french fries for 5 bucks. I didnt have any problem with the lighting which I heard made your food blue but not for us,even if my food was blue I wouldnt care because it was awesome! the only reason there are not 5 stars here is partially my own fault, I ordered the sweet potato fries but I had never had sweet potatoes before, I know now that I dont like them but the regular fries are very good. all in all a great place to eat and I would really recommend this place to anyone who loves a good burger.

UPDATE.....I rated Blu Burger a while back and said that I did not see a colored tint to my burger which is true but I went back a few days ago and we sat in a different spot and my whole burger patty was GREEN! lol it was weird at first but I knew it wasnt rotten or anything it was just the lighting,hubbys salmon wrap was also green. It was still delicious though! so pretty much it depends on where you sit and what time of the day it is,the later it is the more colored your patty will be and if you sit more towards the back in the booths I found thats when your patty turns green :)

I first visited a Jimmy Johns during a trip to Minnesota about 4 years ago, I had been drinking that night and we ended up sitting in a Jimmy Johns scarfing down a couple subs! Now fast forward  to today....I knew that they had opened a few stores out here and I just had to go, But I was a bit hesitant because of the fact that when I ate there 4 years ago I was in fact inebriated and anything would have tasted good at that point! So anyways the hubby and I visited the mall today and we passed by a Jimmy Johns on the way in and I knew we had to go, We walked in and there were about 6 employees with smiles on their faces and every single one of them greeted us.....kinda made me giggle a little :) I looked at the menu board on the wall searching for the same sub I had on my first visit, all I could remember was that it was turkey and it had alfalfa sprouts on it....searching.....searching ahhhh there it is! The Turkey Tom! A delish sub with turkey,sprouts,lettuce,tomato and mayo I added provolone cheese to mine. Also I made it a meal with a soda and a huge pickle......yes I said pickle! Not only are the pickles yummy but fun to make your husband jealous with!lol you can get the other usual sides also.The size of the subs are nice 8 inches to be exact and they have really good french bread,you can also buy just the bread which is always a plus! Upon leaving all of the employees once again told us goodbye, I really have nothing bad to say about this place I really enjoyed the food,service,and cleanliness :) I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and hmmm how do I say this......I'll be back! Yeah thats right I just went terminator all over this biotch! lol that was lame sorry!
