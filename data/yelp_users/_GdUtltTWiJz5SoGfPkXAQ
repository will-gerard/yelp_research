Beautifully arranged. Great gift shop. It was a last minute unplanned visit and didn't have a hat with me. Great selection and I purchased one that covered my neck and upper back. Everyone was very nice.

I don't know what some people are looking for but ... We were here on a Monday at lunch and the service was top notch, the food was to die for and the decor was out of this world! We shared the skinny Turkey and Avocado sandwich which came with a wonderful mixed greens salad. The vinaigrette was fab.  This is the second location I've been to. The first time was in Raleigh, NC and great food and service there too!  Some people just need to chill and not be so demanding.

Sadly, this location was a huge disappointment  They didn't have the usual breakfast sandwiches (even though they had pictures of all of them) and couldn't remember to put the sandwich I did order on a plate with a knife. We will avoid this place in the future ... And, when I asked "Chanel" for some ice, she said "go down there" and pointed to the guy who was very busy making drinks. How rude!!!! There wasn't anyone else behind me!!!

Not the caliber we are used to as HH Members. When I opened the door to our room, it smelled like an ashtray! We had asked for a non-smoking room. They said it was but moved us anyway. Thank you.   We had another person with us and asked for a two bed room. Unfortunately, they were double beds!!! I haven't slept in a double bed with my husband ever! We have a king at home. Very uncomfortable to say the least.   However, they were accommodating when we said we had booked an additional day upgraded. They brought us a refrigerator and two robes so that we didn't have to change rooms for our last day.  Two floors were designated HH but they were fully booked. I'd like to know what the difference was.

Really nice place. Enjoyed our lunch outside on the lower patio. Crab and avocado salad with lime and caper vinaigrette. Our server, Ben was very attentive.   Would love to try the upstairs cafe next time.

Amazing White Chocolate Martinis. Starters, the Ahi Tuna appetizer. You have to try the Chicken Crepes. We are told not one of their best but we loved them. Pair them with the spaghetti squash. To die for! Bar service is the best!

Great food. Great service. Lose served us and was great. One of the restaurants at the hotel without smoke from the casino. Yay!!!  Love Mexican food as long as it's not spicy with peppers. I know, it's an oxymoron  What can I say?  But they prepared my food just the way I like it.   Even the manger stopped by our table to check on our large group. They gave us separate checks without a problem. All the staff was friendly and patient with us.

Zero stars. This place has been closed for at least a year. We heard that The Holiday Inn bought it and are renovating it.

What a nice place to spend your birthday. Lauren was very accommodating and it was a pleasure to meet Ernesto, the manager. Appreciated that he came over to our table to wish my husband and I happy birthday. We both have April birthdays.

Very disappointing! Rooms are nice but no happy hour on the weekends. No refreshments at the pool. The pool was noting special. The Patio only had two tables to sit in the shade. And to top it off, they wanted an additional $5 per person for buffet breakfast. Every other Hilton we've been to breakfast has been free. We are Gold Honors members! That was an insult! Service was mediocre and our room smelled funny. It got better after I turned the A/C off.

Garett was great. Took our order, then things got confused. After getting our food in the wrong order ...  Our food was fabulous, the Sake flight was tasty (could have had another ) and service got a lot better.   Oysters were great, salmon fabulous and beef tasty. Desert was to die for. Gotta try the Cream brûlée and baked ice cream. My hubby had the bread pudding and said it was fabulous!  They also gave us a Yelp discount and separate checks.

We are checked in. What a lovely surprise! Staff is very friendly and accommodating at check in. Christina is great.!  A historic hotel purchased by Hilton 3 yrs ago. SW design, a student of FLR. Copper everywhere, pottery and kachinas. Cozy in the bar. Bryan at the bar is very creative in concocting something special if you say "surprise me".    We have been to enough Hilton chain residences to know that this is a standard room. Clean and updated. SW accents.   We will definitely stay here again when we visit up north.

I love this shop! Almost everything French and Paris. And next-door is a clothing store with a lot of Paris apparel. I'll come back the next time we are in the area. Betty was very helpful.
