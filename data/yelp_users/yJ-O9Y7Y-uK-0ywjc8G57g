I was a little worried to rent from a smaller, lesser known rental car company. I read the reviews on extra charges and upgrades that were unapproved. But it was hard to resist as their prices are so much better then the big boy national chains.   If you stripped the Advantage sign off of their walls and replaced it with Hertz or Enterprise, you wouldn't have noticed any difference. The staff manning the rental car desk where I confirm my reservation were very friendly and professional. They didn't try to upsale me or hide anything.   When I went downstairs to pick up my car, my major concern was Advantage adding misc damage charges after I returned it. So I used my iphone and recorded every inch in a video and noted even the slightest scratches on the form. We received a clean, "new" Toyota Camry with AC, bluetooth and mp3 player. Perfect for our needs.  I've checked my bill since and no extra charges have been applied. I would certainly use them again, and use the same tactics to ensure I didn't get charged extra for phantom damages.  The only real issue with this rental car facility is that I went downstairs to the cars first instead of straight to the reservation desk. Kind of a nuisance as their signage is not very clear.

South Mountain is a perfect mountain for travelers that don't have much time or gear to go hiking and find the scenic views of phoenix. We were in town for a wedding, and had only 8 hours to really explore Phoenix. It was recommended we drive up South Mountain to Dobbin's Lookout. We didn't have any hiking gear or trail knowledge, so hearing that we could drive to the top of a local peak was ideal.  It takes about 20-30 minutes to drive up to the top, and it is a great pretty good view. A couple of benches and a shaded tower structure occupy the lookout. There are random points along the way where you can stop and take pics of the view. Kudos to those who are able to bike/hike their way to the top.  There are bathrooms near the bottom of the mountain, and just an FYI, those bathrooms come with no doors. And if reaching the summit is not your thing, there are plenty of trails for you to explore.

My girlfriend was eager to go back to Lulu's as she was a regular during her days attending Art Institute of Pittsburgh. So it looked like a great place for an evening snack (not really a late night place).   First the bad. I ordered the Korean bibimbap bowl with duck. The bowl was topped with kimchi and duck. The duck was greasy but tasty and the kimchi was a little dry. Beneath this thin layer of toppings was an iceberg size portion of rice. Too much rice. Now, I like rice, but I like rice with something to go with it. It's like eating plain bread, doesn't make sense, you need your pb & j to top your bread. Now the bowl was only $7, which explains all the rice, but still, give me something, anything, to sauce my rice.  Now the good. I had a mango smoothy and some scallion pancakes. The mango smoothy was made from fresh mangos and definitely hit the spot. I'd get a big gulp of that next time. The scallion pancakes were the thinnest pancakes I've had. I've had medium thickness (my moms pancakes), thick pancakes (little dragons in Columbus, OH) and now thin. I really enjoyed the thin, easier to munch on and you taste the salt and oniony-ness more. The mango smoothie and scallion pancakes each earned the 2 stars for Lulu's.   Maybe next time I'll just get mango smoothies and onion pancakes.

I was pretty excited to eat here. The main reason I was excited was I could try their stinky tofu. I had stinky tofu years (maybe decades) ago and couldn't take it. I wanted to give it another try.   So my friends and I ordered a lot of food, about 5 appetizers (stinky tofu, taro cake, scallion and egg pancakes, and some others). All of the appetizers were great. I loved the scallion pancakes with the egg and beef. Good stuff!   The stinky tofu was what I was waiting for. I decided to smell it again to see if it would reignite any memories. Nothing came forward, but it was stinky. I ate one and I could taste the stink. Not as strong as I thought it would be. Now my Taiwanese friends tell me that the Rose Tea Cafe's version is definitely not as strong as what is produced in Taiwan, and I think I'm very thankful for this. But overall I enjoyed it and would have it again and even try a stronger version of it.  Really good Mango smoothy. And their main entree dishes were just as good. At the end of the feeding frenzy, I was pushing the limits of my belt. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'm definitely stopping by here.

Stop by here after a day of wedding stuff and an evening of walking around Mt. Washington. It was surprisingly empty and thus very relaxing. Plenty of arm room and I could have a normal conversation. Now onto the food.   I'm not  big fan of Joe's. Back in Akron where I first had Joe's, I was so turned off I dubbed it "Joe's Crap Shack". Now it's gotten better since, but the seafood is still kind of average for me. I ordered some coconut shrimp, and it just didn't do anything for me. Other than this, the service and atmosphere were pretty good.
