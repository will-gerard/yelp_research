One of the best BBQ restaurants I've been too. The place looks a little run down, but it only adds character. Open late (til 9:30pm I believe) this is a quick, easy lunch or dinner for us.  My favorites are the BBQ beef sandwich, potato salad and the cobbler is great too. A definite must! And there are multiple locations throughout the Valley.

The best BBQ in Phoenix, hands down.

I'd been to Postinos a couple times, but once I took my parents there, it's the only place they ever want to go! As big wine folks, they know that after the hour and a half drive from Tucson, they just want to relax and have a glass of wine and some bruschetta.  While there isn't a HUGE menu to select from, the bruschetta, soups, salads and paninis are perfectly portioned, amazingly tasty and refreshing, no matter what time of year. Their unique selection of bruschetta includes apple and brie with fig spread, proscuitto with figs and mascarpone and salami with pesto (plus a few others). And their wine list makes up for it. They have an extensive selection that they change out regularly, and you can buy a bottle on your way out to enjoy at home.  My favorite that I discovered at Postinos is the Hey Mambo.  Tucked away in a charming neighborhood in Phoenix, Postinos is a great place to enjoy some wine and bruschetta. They usually do have the garage door open, so you get the fresh outdoors no matter where you sit. When the weather is perfect out, the outdoor seating is great too.  Although 90% of the time you have to valet park due to limited parking, it is only $3 and very convenient. It is probably one of the only places I don't mind valet parking at in Phoenix.

I don't know why anyone would ever use Domino's after eating a slice of Venezia's! Their sauce is out of this world and so tasty, as is their crust. You can tell they make it by hand everyday.  And their lunch specials (and they also have daily specials) are just the right size. I had a slice of pizza and a small salad for less than $7.00.  The Tempe location is large inside, but around lunchtime it is really busy! We got one of the last tables. Venezia's is a definite must for pizza in Phoenix.

Without a doubt, the Italian Grotto has the best atmosphere in Old Town for a meal, and doesn't make you feel like you're in Scottsdale at all. Cozy and full of life every time I've been, the Italian Grotto has a pretty good wine and beer list, as well as some amazing food.  WARNING: Don't fill up on bread! From favorites (and my favorite) Manicotti, to my boyfriends favorite Chicken Carolina, the Italian Grotto has a wide variety of entrees on their menu (which look like they are falling apart, but I don't mind!) that do not disappoint. The Manicotti was melt in your mouth good, and the extra cheese they put on top was like icing on the cake.  The waiters are always super nice and helpful, and the last time we walked in, the owner showed us to our table personally, which you rarely get at restaurants these days! When the weather is nice out, they open their side doors and push the tables out a little, so you can sit out and enjoy the air and people watch.  This is not really a place you'd want to go when you're looking for a quiet, intimate meal, but the dim lighting and cozy tables can feel quite romantic. If there's a game on, all bets are off though! We went there during March Madness and it was pretty noisy until the game was over (which we didn't mind, we actually came to watch the end of the game).   If I had to pick a place for Italian food in the Valley, the Italian Grotto would definitely be it.

I used to come here when I lived in Phoenix and the weather was nice. I've been for happy hours, baby showers, lunches and dinners and there's a reason my friends and co-workers always came back.  Coming back for the holidays, I wanted to take my boyfriend (who hadn't been to Phoenix recently and had previously not been beyond Scottsdale) to a cute, romantic, quiet place so he could experience everything I had loved about living in Phoenix.  House of Tricks definitely delivered. We had a great time and the food was perfect. Our meals were cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable. My boyfriend is gluten-free (not by choice) and they were able to cater to his dietary needs.

Love this place! The food is so fresh tasting and everything they use is locally grown. I've been here just for lunch a couple times, and each time is great. Today I had the Roasted Chicken Club (without the mayo), that comes with fresh greens on the side too. The grain bread they use is amazingly good and the entire sandwich is just fresh!  Also, Essence is known for their macaroons, which simply are amazing. I've had the mint and raspberry with rose filling and both are so tasty.  The patio (although small) is a great place to sit and relax outside when the weather is nice.  My only gripe is the single shot latte's - they only fill the cup half  full for $2.95. If you want a full cup, remember to order the double shot latte!

I live right down the street from Papago, so I love its close proximity to my place. Driving up Galvin Parkway (which goes through Papago Park) is a refreshing drive and makes me forget that I'm in the middle of Phoenix (you also miss a lot of traffic going to Old Town or Mill).   There are some good, easy trails for fun hiking (nothing like Camelback or Squaw Peak). Also there are multiple rock formations you can climb up and see great views of Phoenix. It's especially fun to go there and watch the sunset!

Easily put, a WAY better alternative to Filiberto's  when craving late night mexican food. They have a wide range of the typical mexican fast food and drinks.

Love, Love, Love this place. I waited three years to get new glasses and the optometrist was great. I brought in my old glasses and he analyzed the frame, the lenses and then took the time to educate me in what I should really be looking for in glasses now. I previously went to a cheaper store and got what I paid for.  Yes, it was more expensive than say LensCrafters, but after waiting so long to get a new pair, I figured getting a GOOD pair was the way to go and it was totally worth it. The salesgal went through every pair of glasses with me until I found the pair that looked the best and would fit the type of prescription I would be getting (because of an eye condition I had to get no line bifocals). And, she knew everything about the glasses which helped me make the decision.  I had a great experience here and will definitely be returning within the next three years.

We were recently at Geisha a Go-Go for a friends birthday for dinner and karaoke.  First we did dinner, then karaoke in the BIG room, which was a blast.  My issue was our waitress. We were there on a Tuesday night and we were some of the only people in the place, so the excuse "it was just really busy" doesn't apply.  A couple of us ordered Hot Rock dinners, which were supposed to come with rice. Our meals came with no rice and when we brought it up to the waitress, the following conversation ensued:  Us: Hi, I think our meal is supposed to come with rice, right? Waitress: Yeah, but usually the meat is filling enough, so I didn't bring it out. Us: Okay, but it's listed on the menu. Waitress: I know.  Um, I'm still being charged for it, right? And the Shrimp Hot Rock meal came with 3 shrimp and a tiny Asian salad.  Wow, how filling. There were other issues with her service, like bringing out the other, more expensive wine that I didn't ask for twice.  I will probably never go back to Geisha for a meal, but it is a good place for drinks at the bar with friends on the weekend. Or on a weeknight if you don't want a big crowd but fun atmosphere.  The reason for the "Meh, I've experienced better" rating, and why it is not at an "Eek! Methinks not" is because we did have a good time...when we didn't have to deal with the waitress.

Great place for sushi and non-sushi lovers. I went there my second time today for lunch, and it is really easy to get to by car, walking, or light rail!  The restaurant is clean and simple, with plenty of table even during lunchtime. I had the Tiger Roll (shrimp, avocado and cucumber) and a side of white rice, which was perfect for my hunger level.  My boyfriend's Beef Teriyaki Bowl was very simple (rice and beef with sauce), but was very tasty!  Haiku Grill has a pretty extensive sushi and non-sushi menu, and is a good alternative to Mill Ave. for lunch!

Good place to grab a quick lunch. The menu is typical of other gyro places, but the service is fast -  I was in and out with my takeout order within 5 mins on a Monday at noon. The $5 lunch deal is a steal and very good!   Their Mediterranean Chicken sandwich was better than I've had at other places and has extra seasonings on it.  Also, if you're on the Light Rail you can get off at the Washington and Priest stop, and it's right there!

The best part about the Tempe Beach are the festivals and events that happen here almost every weekend.   The Tempe Beach is a great venue for enjoying the outdoors, especially in the Spring and Fall. New Years Eve and 4th of July events happen here yearly, as well as many festivals, concerts and other events.   This year I've been to The Great Arizona Beer Festival and the Arizona Chicks with Picks Music Fest, both of which were amazingly fun and relaxing. Just walking around the park or sitting on the grass listening to music, with (or without) a beer in my hand in the great weather really helps me realize why I live here and makes the summers a little more manageable.  Check out a list of upcoming events on the Downtown Tempe site: http://www.downtowntempe.com/  It is really easy to get to from I-10, and the 101 and 202 (as well as the Light Rail), so there's no excuse! Close by are Mill Ave, ASU, Papago Park and the Oakland A's spring training park, so you can easily spend a day enjoying the outdoors in Tempe.

Amazing find!  They have a huge selection of beers on tap, that are not your typical Budweiser. Also, beers come in Schooners, which just make it more fun to drink.  The bar area can get a little cramped, but if you come to watch the game, you're in luck cause there are flat screens throughout the rest of the tavern's dining area and above the bar that can easily be seen from outside.  I recommend the spinach and artichoke dip, tater tots, steak salad (amazing) and margherita pizza. We have been here multiple times and I can't say anything bad about it!

I love being in downtown Tempe, so when I got a SpaFinder gift card for Christmas from my boyfriend, I knew I wanted to use it at Mood Swings. Mood Swings has a fun, trendy salon atmosphere, but everyone is really nice and not pretentious at all.  My first experience was getting a 60 min. massage, which felt so good! The spa downstairs was very quiet and I forget that I was in downtown Tempe. Before the massage they had me fill out a questionnaire that asked me if I had a stressful job, if there were any areas that were bothering me, etc...which I'd never had before when I got a massage and helped them get to know me better.  I returned to Mood Swings when I needed of a haircut and highlights touch-up. I usually go to a beauty school, but I had a sketchy experience last time that made me want to try somewhere new. I was not disappointed! The salon upstairs made me feel really comfortable and my hair stylist, Brittany, did a great job and I have no complaints! I'll definitely return.  They also have a great email program, where they send out last minute appointments they are trying to fill (and you get a discount!) and surveys that also have discounts upon completion.  They really do follow up and ensure that your experience is as good as possible.

I went to Verizon at Tempe Marketplace on a weekday after I got off work because my phone was making a random beeping noise every 15 minutes that was unrelated to my battery, so I wanted someone in technical services to take a look at it and show me how to make it stop. Once I entered the store, I signed in using their kiosk and waited patiently for over 30 minutes.  After my name was called, I went to ask the lady to look at my phone, only to discover that they DO NOT have anyone in technical services at that store, ever, which means that there is no one to help when customers are having issues with their current phone. The next closest store to me is at 16th St. and Camelback Rd., which from now on I'm going to exclusively.  The only thing they could do was switch out my phone for a new one, however, they didn't have any in stock, so I would have had to go to another store anyways. Talk about a pointless trip during rush hour.  Bottom Line: Try another Verizon store, not this one!
