I had never heard of Border Grill, but when family that we were in Vegas with suggested heading there for their tapas style all you can eat brunch on a Saturday morning I was in. When they say all you can eat.. they mean it! We were there for about 3 and a half hours enjoying their delicious offerings plus $8 bottomless mimosas. We sat outside near the pool since the weather was perfect and really enjoyed our brunch.   Because there were more than 5 of us they suggested ordering family style so the food would come out a little more quickly so we did and it worked out quite well. After being seated were were automatically brought out some tasty guava empanadas and fresh fruit to much on while we decided on our mimosa flavors (did I mention there were 7 flavors to choose from??) and our first few menu items. We ended up trying 11 of their 22 dishes and some of the favorites were the Shrimp and Grits, Breakfast Fries and Bread Pudding French toast. Almost every dish was in some way super decedent and rich and it worked out perfectly to just have a few bites and move on to the next dish.  Our waitress, Rachel, was amazing. She was super helpful with suggestions and answered any questions that we had. She also amazingly kept up with our mimosa and food requests as well as refreshing our plates, silver wear and water glasses when needed. She also never got tired of us asking her to repeat the mimosa flavors (maybe listing them on the menu would be a good idea).  Great experience and I would definitely choose this over a buffet any day!

Quick summary... this place is awesome! It's located in a cute little part of Glendale in what must have been a house at some point. The service was excellent. We had a super sweet waiter who was very attentive. Their fresh spring rolls were good (and served in a cute little divided dish)  although a little hard to eat.. My filling kept falling into the peanut sauce. The Pho was good as well.. there wasn't a ton of beef in it but it was still filling and the price was right so it didn't bother me much. They offer a variety of imported beer options which is fun and their thai tea boba was delish. Definitely a neat little find while driving through Phoenix on the way back to Tucson. The prices were also the best I've seen for Pho in a while. I'd love to come back here.

I don't really get this place... how can they market it as a four star hotel when it is clearly a crappy old motel with a few trendy updates? Also, I booked on hotwire because it was listed as having free WIFI and parking but they actually charge a $20 daily fee for parking, WIFI, etc. My other complaint was that their delivery trucks came before 6am and were super loud even though were were on the 4th floor. It was so loud I couldn't sleep but also had a hard time carrying out work calls. Saving grace? A seriously delicious Mexican restaurant attached to the hotel. It was awesome to be able to enjoy a pitcher of margaritas and walk back to our room. The pool also looked cool but we were there in November...

There isn't much to say that the other hundreds of reviews haven't. Definitely worth the trek out to Palace Station for some delicious Oysters on the half shell. We lucked out and around 8:30pm there were only 8 people in line in front of us so we grabbed a few beers from one of the casino bars and chatted away for about half an hour before we were seated at the Oyster Bar. We enjoyed a couple dozen Oysters and a few shooters before digging into a couple of Pan Roasts. We got two between the four of us and with the oysters we had already eaten it was plenty of food and worth the $5 shared plate fee. Note to self.... next time save the bread they give you in the beginning to dip in the sauce! We enjoyed chatting with the chefs who cook in those amazing kettles.. even the guy shucking oysters went to culinary school! If there is a next time for me I'll be ordering the shrimp scampi. Every time they cooked up a batch the smell of sauteed garlic made my mouth water. All around great place. They're open 24/7 so I'd be curious to see what kind of crowds they have eating raw oysters for breakfast :)

Living in Arizona there is obviously no shortage of amazing Mexican restaurants but I have to say... this is one of my favorites. I had the shrimp burrito and it was probably the best burrito I've ever had. The service was slow considering the place was practically empty but it was worth the wait. I will definitely be heading back here next time I'm in Phoenix and will do my best to order something else... no promises though.

I stopped in here the other day after flying into Sky Harbor because it was so close to the Airport. The restaurant is really small and cute. It must have someone's house in a prior life. It was happy hour for drinks (11am-6pm) but their food specials didn't start until 3. Their unique variations on the classic fresh spring roll definitely intrigued me. We had the one with tuna, avocado and mango with a miso dipping sauce in addition to the traditional spring roll. They were both awesome but you only get one roll for the price (I'm used to getting two with an order for close to the same price). We also split the beef pho and ahi salad. Both were fresh and tasty. I wouldn't say the pho was more exceptional than any I've had before but it was good and the beef seemed to be a bit higher quality than I've had in other places. The ahi salad dressing was the same dipping sauce we had with the spring roll so I was a bit tired of it towards the end and let my fiance finish it off. My only two complaints were that the sinks for the restrooms were out in the common area... a little weird and that we had empty water glasses fairly frequently. Otherwise... if I lived in the area I would definitely be back to try some more spring rolls!

I've wanted to try a Mellow Mushroom for a while now... I've heard lots of good things. The pizza was absolutely delicious. The crust was definitely the best part... I wish you could just order that. The only negative here were the terrible wings: they weren't served hot, they were small and lacked flavor. Should have skipped those. I had the grapefruit basil martini which was awesome. I think they may have used fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Overall I think it was a tad bit expensive for a pizza joint but I'm glad I checked it out. Too bad there isn't one in Tucson!

A lesson in booking through Hotwire... don't do it. I suppose that's the trouble with booking a hotel without knowing what it is before hand. First of all, the room ended up being more expensive through Hotwire than on their website and secondly the hotel was  terrible. At least the location was awesome (hence two stars instead of one). We were able to walk to a ton of great shops, restaurants and bars and there was a food truck meet up going on across the street from the hotel! I hadn't looked at the Yelp reviews of this Travelodge so I assumed it would be fine but as soon as we pulled into the parking lot we had a feeling we wouldn't be impressed. The hotel looked abandoned. Hardly anyone there, the grounds were dingy, no cars in the parking lot. The staff was unfriendly and had zero personality. The room was gross: stickers on the headboard of the bed, broken and stained ceiling tiles in the bathroom, dirty floor and bathtub, etc. The place was noisy all night long. There were really bright lights outside of the room that weren't blocked by the curtain. The heat didn't work in the room and I couldn't find any extra blankets to keep warm with. The breakfast was pretty unimpressive: cereal, unappetizing looking pre-packaged pastries, apples, juice, coffee and milk. They didn't even have water...? Weird.  I'm not really sure how this place is still in business. Having never stayed at a Travelodge before I'm curious if they are all this terrible or if we just lucked out picking the worst one they have for our first (and probably last stay). I'm glad we were only there for a few hours! Thanks a lot Hotwire ;)

I randomly stumbled across this off the strip restaurant when looking at places to try on an upcoming trip to Vegas (thanks to Yelp as usual!). It only took us about 15 minutes to get to and it was really nice to feel a bit more like I was enjoying a local pick and not a super touristy casino restaurant. The prices weren't cheap by any means, but for a treat on vacation and for good quality food and service it's worth the splurge for sure. I loved the shabby chic look of the restaurant and my favorite part about the place was the large butcher block out in front of the open kitchen that they would use to finish dishes before bringing them out to the table. It was fun to watch them add a drizzle of this or a dash of that as a finishing touch. The service was also great without being over the top.  I started the meal with a delicious citrus and strawberry cocktail. They also had a few beers and wine that sounded good as well. As for the food... everything on the menu sounded pretty good but I definitely had my eye on the Charred Octopus. The scallops or salmon would have been my typical choice but the chicken was enticing me because it came with their mac n cheese which sounded awesome. My fiance didn't want to split the Octopus as an appetizer so I ended up getting just that and the mac n cheese... no entree needed! It was still too much for me to finish. I loved loved loved the octopus. It was perfectly cooked.. not chewy at all and had a great charred flavor. The fingerling potatoes, avocado, romesco and aioli it was served with sounds like a lot but they complemented the octopus perfectly. I loved that I could make each bite unique by mixing and matching the accompaniments. The mac and cheese was super rich but well balanced with the addition of kale. I couldn't even finish half of it though which worked out since I munched on it later that night after coming back from some casinos.   My fiance got the meatball pizza and it was great. I probably would have gotten a plain margarita pizza because the crust, sauce and cheese didn't really need much more but he said he liked the meatballs. His only complaint was the caramelized onions were a bit too sweet but since he ate the entire pizza after his large salad it didn't seem like a deal breaker to me.   We were rushing to get to a show so we didn't make time for dessert but I did see a few steaming cups go by that intrigued me and after asking what it was I decided to finish dinner with a cup of their tea. They bring you hot water in a cute cup with your own individual mini honey bear and then bring you a box of Harney and Sons teas to choose from. The mint green tea was delicious with a touch of honey and was the perfect end to my meal.   Dear Honey Salt owners, please open another restaurant in Tucson so I can enjoy that Octopus on a regular basis!

We stopped in here the other day because the sports bar near it was full and had an indefinite wait. They said they'd play the game we wanted to see and had a few TVs plus it was after lunch and before dinner so it wasn't crowded at all. I was having trouble deciding on a pizza or salad so when my friend ordered a pizza and they asked if she wanted the 12 inch or the 9 inch with a salad (lunch special) my little dilemma was solved (first world problems over here). I really liked the veggie salad and margarita pizza I got. Their happy hour was good too... $2.50 drafts! We had already been seated and gotten drinks before they told us they wouldn't be playing the game we wanted to see though... they don't have the NFL ticket.

Wow - just delicious food. Fairly limited menu and nothing fancy but the food was just fantastic. So much of it was made in house (including the bread and strawberry preserves). Their fresh squeezed honey lemonade was awesome. It gets pretty busy on the weekends but I can see why. I wish we had something like this in Tucson!
