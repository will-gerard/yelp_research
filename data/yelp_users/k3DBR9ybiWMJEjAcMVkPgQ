Worst customer service experience I can remember.  We sat down at a blackjack table and were completely ignored by the dealer, Lisa. We watched her deal four or five hands to the gentleman that was already sitting at the table when we got there without her even looking at us or saying a word. When we repeatedly asked if we could get chips for the money which we had on the table she didn't even acknowledge us. It was quite surreal.  I asked a manager on the floor what was going on and he said that he didn't know and that there was nothing he could do!? I then spoke to his boss, Albert. All Albert was able to tell me was that he was sorry and that he would buy me a drink. I told him that was unacceptable and that I wanted to know why I was treated so rudely. He made no effort to talk to the dealer or check the tapes and did not take down my contact information to resolve the issue the following day. I felt his tone was condescending and dismissive.  I don't recall ever being treated so rudely by an employee or being disregarded so bluntly by management in my life. I will not be going back to the Talking Stick Resort & Casino ever again.

These guys are the best; they have a fantastic website that lets your easily book appointments, their customer service is exceptional and they do a fantastic job on your car glass repair. My technician was Josh and he was very professional. I won't use anyone else for windshield repair or replacement again.

For a place that only serves one kind of food, they have a surprising Humber if different delicious things to eat!  The beers are all very good and the deserts are just incredible.
