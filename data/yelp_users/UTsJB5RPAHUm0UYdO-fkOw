Shame on me (us) for assuming the employees here would come around. We played a 14 week league here...almost 4 months including breaks...which included zero involvement from management. The staff screwed up our drinks and food and league prices every week. Every. Friggin.Week. Every time. It became a joke after awhile until we realized the joke was on us. We so wanted this to work out because it's less than half a mile from us. They are great for pouring (the wrong) beer and signing you up for (the wrong) leagues. Be warned. We are driving 3 miles one way farther to avoid this mess. Sad.

I was a new patient here and they took my insurance (BCBS PPO). I saw Dr. Suni (Sunildat Maheshwari) and he was amazing. He took time to talk to me about what I was there for - he set his clipboard aside and we talked for about 15 minutes. The staff is friendly, but a bit busy for my taste - which is of course a good sign. I have been looking for a new PCP for awhile now and I believe I've found it. The parking is great, it's in a nice part of town, and the hours are awesome: late hours mon-thurs, and open weekends.

I really couldn't be happier with their service and their product. I called yesterday and got a quote, and my glass tabletop was finished today. They are super friendly and really great at understanding what you are looking for. My husband and I wanted to go local and we are glad we did. I cannot recommend them enough.

This place has been providing outstanding service for years. I had some (interesting) stuff pierced here years ago, so when I wanted to repierce my nose, I knew I had to go back...except, when I walked by the piercing kiosk at the mall, I decided to get it over with. This was a mistake...obvi.   After struggling to get it to heal, I went in to have the jewelry changed, which was done by JD, a total pro. The staff is excellent from the chick working with walk-ins to the piercer. If I had to say anything negative, it would be the wait (they do not take appointments).

My family has Greek food about twice a week, and were recommended this joint. The food is fresh and delicious, and when I asked for cucumber in lieu of a pita with my hummus, they complied at no extra cost. The gyro meat is outstanding, and I like that they have a little bar. I did have to ask twice for extra dressing, and had cheese on my salad when I asked for none. Otherwise, this would be a 5-star rating.

We have been here many times and I have been meaning to write a review for them. Friendly, fresh, delicious! The chutney bar is awesome, the food is amazing for the price, and the employees are so helpful. It's kind of "hole-in-the-wall"-ish, but don't let looks deceive. Excellent veggie food.

Love this place. The instructors, the members, owners...everyone is encouraging without being intrusive, and the WODs are perfectly grueling. It's one of my favorite places to be. :)

We love Mediterranean food and this is right across the street from our house. We have eaten there probably 5-6 times. It has progressively gotten worse. They give us a 20% coupon so we use it. I feel like they decrease the amount of food if you have a coupon!   The last few times the portions are extremely small. The final straw? I ordered the shrimp kabob because they were out of their daily deal (at 2pm!). This dish is $10 and there were 5 shrimp, a scoop of salad, a scoop of rice and HALF a pita. The shrimp were cold and tough as nails. And their sides? Go ahead and order one. You'll pay $3 for about 4 tablespoons of whatever it is that you ordered.   Our first experience was wonderful, but we've spent a lot of money trying to recreate it. NEVER again.

We absolutely love this place. The food is consistently outstanding (the menu is amazing for a stop-in Greek joint), and the staff is stellar. We eat here probably 4 times a month, but when we take-out, they always make sure we have everything we need. I do hope they get a permanent sign sometime soon though, but only because it makes me nervous that they plan on moving. Lol!

I have eaten here many times and just realized I should leave a review.  There are about 6 Greek places nearby and I've burned through most because it's my favorite type of food.  This place is CONSISTENTLY awesome.  The food and service are great. ..every.single.time.

There are a few Greek restaurants in our area that we love (Rural/Ray) but they are all closed on Sunday. So, when we are craving Greek on a Sunday, this is the only one around us open. The food is okay for the price, but the service is bad. We called to order food and were "accidentally" disconnected twice. The man took my order and sounded like my basic order was a waste of his time. Got there to pick the food up and they had "forgotten" to make some of it, and honestly, it's just not that good. The salad was fresh - hence the two stars vs. one - , but the curds were a fried lump of melted cheese with some batter bits on top. Weird! This was our third bad experience as we are slow learners, but unfortunately we won't be going back which is a shame.

Wow...I've never paid so much ($7.99) for such a small bowl of soup. Thanks for the 3 shrimp...2 bits of tomato and 3 mushrooms in BROTH...in a half quart container. Additionally, we called 8 minutes before they were open...they took the call, but not our order. Told us to call back in 8 minutes. Backwards logic. Not good business considering they are one of 5 Thai restaurants within 3 miles. Won't be going back.

Our family recently decided to stop purchasing  plants from big box home improvement stores (for no other reason that to support southwest growers).   I love walking around the nursery and every employee that we encountered eagerly asked if we needed help, and were happy to discuss the plants in question. One particular young man talked us through organic pest control and even gave my daughter and I a clipping for Mother's Day. The price is a little higher than Home Depot/Lowes, but we were prepared to pay more and got what we paid for.   I see some other comments about accepting credit cards - they took ours just fine.

This place rocks my world every time. The options are virtually limitless and I love that you can get a poke bowl AND sushi. Every item is totally fresh and delicious, and the staff is fast and friendly. I was there a few weeks ago and this older lady was commenting on how cool the soy sauce bottles were. An employee offered to give her one and the lady was just so happy. Super glad to have a place like this in my neighborhood.

My husband and I took our CCW course here (will provide feedback on the course - which was awesome - on her Yelp! account), and were so impressed by the professional organization and friendly staff. The guns were a little pricey, but that can vary from week to week anyway. We are definitely fans and customers for life.

The food here is amazing, and the service is fast and friendly. I got the tonkatsu, my daughter got the miso with tofu, my son had Japanese rice balls, and my husband had the curry bowl. The pork buns were our apps, and they were good but slightly dry. The only thing I'd like to see change (I didn't want to rate down), was the loud music in the tiny spot. Man, I could've used some Sinatta or something other than the pop Pandora shuffle they had going on.
