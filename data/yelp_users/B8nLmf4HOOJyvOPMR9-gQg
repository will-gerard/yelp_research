Don't bother scheduling your appointment in advance online(they never received my reservation even though I had a confirmation number.). Also make sure you give your name at "check-in" to at least three different people to make sure you get on the list.

Called the Phoenix Police regarding a home burglary at 4:00pm today.  It's now 8:10pm and still no officer.  I called the non emergency number to follow up and the call is STILL "in queue".

Unimpressed with this location.  The staff must be timed because the service has felt very rushed all three times I visited this location.  As a guy, I get my nose, ears, brows, and the tops of my feet waxed.  Though the staff are friendly, it doesn't do any good when they are rushing and I have to finish with tweezers at home after just paying them $64 to do it.  I gave three opportunities, I won't be going back.

Why is this place so DIRTY?!  I have been a member for 9 months and have not once seen anyone cleaning in this gym(other than the members)  Not even the employees!  I've come at random times during the week and weekend.  NEVER.  At other Gyms I had memberships at, they had a dedicated employee wiping the machines and cleaning the floors 24/7.  They were also half the price.    At Gold's you see dust bunnies all over the place, the machines have spit and sweat splattered all over them and at least every few weeks the sewage backs up in this building.  Have you ever tried to concentrate and work out while deeply breathing in human sewage smell?  Not pleasant.  Lastly, half the televisions on the cardio equipment either don't have cable, no picture, or is complete static.  Its unfortunate because this gym is in a great location, gets a lot of traffic and has so much to offer.  It's just lacking in the most basic of areas when it comes to sanitation.  Especially for it being an "Elite" facility.    I'm still debating whether I will keep my membership here or switch to the brand new Mountain Side fitness facility in the US Airways center across the street.    On a positive note, the gal that works the early morning hours during the week, SOO friendly!  She always has a smile when you walk in the door and wishes you a good day when leaving.

Went for brunch and the staff was super friendly, food was excellent.  The French press coffee(with real cream), fresh pressed orange juice(which is so hard to find in this city), mimosa, ham and egg croissant sandwich, everything was great!  Probably one of my newest favorite brunch places.  :-)

I love how they use organic/local ingredients and offer organic wine and beer options.
