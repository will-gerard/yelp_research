This place has the best Thai food in the East Valley. Their Pad Thai is outstanding. One of their waitresses is a little crazy and you can't really understand anything she says, but hey, at least you know it's authentic Thai. :) My only complaint is that they don't have crab wontons on their appetizer menu!

Tons of people have hyped up the Wynn Buffet to me... It did not disappoint. Prime rib, roast turkey, crab legs, veal, pasta cooked to order, quality meat and cheese selections and the prettiest dessert area I've ever seen. Totally worth the 30 some dollars. Everything I tried was amazing. If you like buffets, you need to go here.

This place is delicious. The quality of the food is so apparent. We always get these pork potsticker/dumpling things in a chili sauce for an appetizer and they are so full of flavor. We've also tried the steamed bbq pork buns and they were very good. I usually get the Pad Thai for a main entree and I mix the leftover sauce from the potsticker appetizer into the noodles. The chicken in the Pad Thai is so tender and fresh ahh so good. Service is always great.

This place has a really good happy hour! All the food and drink selections on the HH menu are great. I like the grilled cheese/tomato soup combo and the prime rib dip. All their happy hour drinks are $3 and they're super strong. Really cool retro atmosphere and the service was good, no complaints!

This place is fine if you don't normally eat a lot of different types of Asian food. It isn't terrible and the quality is fine but if you eat Asian food reguarly, you will know the difference.   We ordered the Oriental Fried Rice and the Pad Thai and they both were lacking in flavor. Very generous portions though. Also- their Pad Thai isn't Pad Thai... I've had Pad Thai at tons of restaurants and it always uses the same type noodles and has the same tasting sauce. Their version of Pad Thai used thicker noodles and their sauce was bland and not spicy. It just tasted like some sort of Chinese noodle dish... No Thai tastes whatsoever. Red 8 at the Wynn is much better if you're looking for great Asian food on the strip!

I've been here a couple times and I always enjoy the different ceviches and appetizers we order- never tried one that I didn't like. Also their bread rolls and butter are really good. A different bread taste than most are used to but I like that it's unique. Just as a heads up, their drinks are very small for the price you pay for each. Their main entrees are delicious, I love their sea bass. My boyfriend always get this steak/crab combo that I've tried and it's reeeeally good. I did try the lamb once but I was not a fan. Service is excellent, knowledgable, and attentive.

This place is amazing and my friends and I have been coming here for years! I have two favorites... The first is just regular pho with well done brisket. Simple but super tasty. My other fave is their #22... Bun Bo Hue. It's like pho broth but spicy and it comes with the thicker noodles. I also like their Thai Iced Tea.  Their service is great... All the people that work there are really friendly. One of the guys there even remembers my order down to a T... Not just which pho I want but also that I don't like white onions(I prefer cilantro instead), and that I use a fork and not the chopsticks that are already provided on the table. I'm a little picky so I think it's really nice that he remembers.  Try this place, you'll love it!

This is the only restaurant open in the Wynn/Encore until 6 am other than "The Cafe" which is terrible pre-packaged food. I tried the cheeseburger, french fries, and garlic cheese bread. Everything we had was very good for 4am. Will definitely be back again if I'm hungry late at night!

I recently went to The Mission for my birthday dinner with friends. I LOVED it and would recommend it to anyone.  We all shared a couple of the orders of tableside guacamole and it was amazing- probably the best I've ever had. They make it as spicy as you want so we got ours pretty spicy and everyone thought it was great.  I wasn't too hungry so I just ordered an appetizer for my meal- the Pork Belly Pibil. Omg. So. Amazing. It had so many unique flavors and the pork belly was fantastic. "Avocado crema and banana habanero aioli".......... I wish I was a chef that could cook up these kind of creations. Our waiter suggested I order a side of tortillas to put the pork belly in to make mini tacos... Awesome suggestion. I couldn't even finish everything, I was so full.  All of my friends having dinner with me raved about their food as well. I know a couple of them ordered the prix fix meal since we were actually there during AZ Restaurant Week and my boyfriend had the steak tacos. They also brought out a complimentary dessert with a sparkler on it for my birthday!  My only complaint would be that it was very dark! We were seated outside on the patio and there was no light other than some small candles on the table. I'd suggest taking a look at the menu online before you go (if you're going for dinner), because it may be a little hard to see the menu when you get there!

From the menu they have on their website, this place looked pretty promising. However, it turned out to be a disappointment.  We shared the Crab Wontons appetizer to start. The sauce that accompanied the wontons was gross and bland. The wontons themselves were also not good... The crispy part of them was really not that crispy, it was tough and seemed old/spoiled. Also, there was no crab meat in them like the menu had indicated. It was pretty much just like dipping cream cheese in weird sauce.  My bf ordered the "Authentic Traditional Pad Thai" which is a different dish than the "Pad Thai" at this restaurant. When my boyfriend was ordering, he asked our waiter to explain the difference between the two before he made a decision. The server said that the "Authentic Traditional Pad Thai" was very similar to other Pad Thai dishes you would get at other Thai restaurants, whereas the "Pad Thai" was more of an "Americanized" version that had sweet and sour sauce? My boyfriend and I LOVE Thai restaurants and we've been to a lot so he ordered the "Authentic Traditional" version, thinking it would be like the ones we've ordered in the past. It was not. It came out and was soaking in sauce, very unlike every other Pad Thai dish we've ever ordered. We both tried it and it was clear they used half a bottle of fish sauce on the noodles which baffles me because Pad Thai never tastes fishy and it's never bathing in sauce? My boyfriend just ate it anyway and said he wouldn't have liked the other "Pad Thai" dish anyway because pad thai isn't usually made with sweet and sour sauce either... So we're both just confused with their pad thai dishes and the sauces they make them with.  I got the Drunken Noodles entree and it was good. They ask you how spicy you'd like your food from level 1 to level 5. I ordered mine at level 4 and it was just a tad too spicy but that is not the restaurant's fault, I should have played it safe with a level 2 or 3. No complaints about my entree other than I needed a couple water refills to cool my mouth down.  Overall, not the greatest experience. 2 out of 3 of the food items we ordered were severely lacking in quality and taste. I gave it 2 stars though because the service was good and we didn't have to wait long for our food at all. However, that could just be because there was only one other group in the entire restuarant. Probably wouldn't go back. Also, my boyfriend was really sick the next morning after we ate there. I think he threw up 5 times at least, so I'm not sure if he had a mild case of food poisoning from this place or what.   If you want A+ Thai food, go to Mint Thai Cafe on Gilbert Rd. in between Guadalupe and Baseline. Been there a million times and the food is awesome.

My boyfriend and I went for a late lunch and ordered the Salmon Spring Rolls ($13) and the Pad Thai Ghoong ($20) to share. Service was great- our waitress was very friendly, food didn't take too long to come out, and our waters were constantly being refilled. I didn't care for the Salmon Spring Rolls but my bf loved them. I just felt there was too much cheese in them. Or rather, I didn't care for the cheese taste with salmon. The Pad Thai Ghoong was fantastic. The prawns in there were huge and it had a great flavor. You can order everything on the menu to your own spicy level on a scale from 1 to 10. We ordered our Pad Thai at an 8 and it was perfect (we love spicy!). As a heads up- our waitress said that their spicy scale is a bit hotter than most- she said a Medium spiciness would be around a 3. My only complaint would just be that it was pretty pricy for portions that aren't that big- even though Aria markets this as one of their "casual dining" options. We really wanted to try the Crab Fried Rice as well but it was $26 so we passed on it. Overall though, we really enjoyed it. If you like this place, you'll really like Red 8 over at the Wynn which also serves a great Pad Thai and other Asian dishes.

My boyfriend recently took me here for my 23rd birthday... Requested a table overlooking the Bellagio fountains and the view was so beautiful! The complimentary bread basket includes 4 different breads, 3 dipping sauces, and stromboli with cheese and salami! My boyfriend ordered the stracci pasta that has lobster, crab, and shrimp- he loved it. I ordered the spaghetti and it was honestly the best spaghetti I've ever had! We decided on the panna cotta for dessert. It was amazing... A lot of things happening... coconut sorbet, guava juice, a cracker of some sort, some sort of creme brulee type thing, and diced pineapples. They even wrote "Happy Birthday!" on the plate and lit a candle for me. Service was excellent.

Excellent food. Excellent prices (for Vegas). The service was a bit spotty/slow but it wasn't terrible. So many unique burgers, I had a hard time choosing what I wanted. We ordered the artichoke guac for an appetizer... It was okay but I wouldn't order it again.   My boyfriend ordered the Gold Standard and raved about how amazing it was. Even though it looked like a mini burger, he got so full. The food here is very good quality and so rich. When they bring your food out, you'll think you didn't order enough but the size is misleading!   I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly Buns from the "slider section"... So amazing. They were like two little tacos but instead of a taco shell, it was a steamed Chinese bun in the shape of a taco shell with tender Asian flavored pork inside... I LOVED them.   Didn't try the "adult" milkshakes but many tables around us seemed to be enjoying them. Also the Shoestring Fries weren't the greatest.. Maybe we'll try the Steak Cut ones next time. Definitely try this place out if you're at the City Center!

My bf and I really enjoyed this buffet. Our favorite has been the Wynn but after trying out the Wicked Spoon, we both agreed that we now have two favorites! The presentation of the food at this buffet is so unique and fun... Some serving sizes are already prepared for you- each one in its own little pot or Asian carry-out box etc.  I've been to a few Las Vegas buffets and all of them are terrible at doing Asian food. It's always cooked strangely or lacking flavor. This is not the case at Wicked Spoon. All of their Asian food tasted great. They had fried rice and a couple different chicken and pork dishes that I loved. They also have Sriracha and anyone who loves spicy will appreciate that. The only Asian food I didn't care for here was their sushi. Too small with barely any fish/crab in the rolls.  Their dessert section.... So many different sweets for you to try. I particularly enjoyed the apple pie with a scoop of vanilla gelato on top and their chocolate strawberries. If you're at the City Center, I would highly recommend this buffet over Aria's.  My only complaint would be that we arrived around 9pm (they closed at 10) and we noticed that many dishes were gone but they were not refilling them. We knew because there were still place cards out with the names of other dishes not on display anymore. Some of them sounded intriguing and we wished we'd been able to try them! This would not stop me from coming back here though, next time we'll just get there earlier.
