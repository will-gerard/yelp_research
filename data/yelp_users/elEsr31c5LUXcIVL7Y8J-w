Probably the 1st and only time I dine at a CPK. Unpleasant experience overall. Only giving a 2 star for the fact that the waitress was courteous and frequently checked on us. Met with a friend for dinner there as we had something planned close by.   Food was terribly bland to put it nicely, ordered a white corn guac app, when it came out we were disappointed at the portion size first of all and we salted it about 5 times and couldn't get it to taste like anything, even with the small portion we could not get ourselves to finish it... according to my friend the spinach artichoke dip taste and quality has dropped noticeably again like the guac very tasteless, we asked the waitress how it was prepared and after checking with the kitchen, were told it is pre-packaged. Then the pasta for the jambalaya fettuccine was under-cooked.   When the waitress came to check on us and we expressed our disdain, she mentioned such to the manager. Quite to our dismay, instead of apologizing for the poor quality of the food or at least be understanding, the haughty manager ignored our concerns and continued to disregard what we had to say by telling us we were the only ones he's ever heard complain about the food, he even lied and told us that they make the spinach artichoke dip there fresh everyday! Will never visit that CPK again, if any, and discourage others to do so as well. Manager needs to learn some table-side manners when dealing with customers!

Went with a group of 7 of us, spur of the moment craving for Pho. Turned out to be a disappointing visit. The service was less than tolerable. The waitress was slow, doesn't know her menu, and a bit argumentative, had to ask for drink refills all night. When our food came out, which actually did not take long, we were disappointed at the skimpy vegetable servings for our Pho, the lack of sauce/gravy for the crispy egg noodle dish, and a complete misunderstanding of one of the orders. Not enough veggies, no problem, we just asked for an extra vegetable plate for the Pho to split between three of us, but it took them 3 trips back to our table to remember to bring it to us after 2 reminders. Then when we asked for more sauce for the dry crispy noodles, the kitchen came back and said they are unable to make more without making a whole other batch and essentially charging us another plate... As for the misunderstood order... My friend just asked for their chicken rice plate except he wanted to substitute the chicken with shrimp since shrimp rice plate was not an option on the menu, waitress said yes they can do that but will have to charge him extra which he was fine with. What my friend ended up with was a simple sauteed shrimp served over plain white rice in their smallest white rice bowl, nothing like what is shown in the pictures of their rice "plate." After several run arounds and back and forth with the kitchen about the rice plate we thought they finally understood so they took his dish back to the kitchen and what came back was merely the same thing now served back to him on a white plate... To top off the ridiculous evening we were told we had to be charged a fee for using our credit cards! To be fair, the Special Pho was good but nothing spectacular, definitely not worth enduring the poor customer service when there are other Pho restaurants serving better food and with service that exceeds Pho Dalat's by 100%

Definitely my favorite sushi spot in all of Phoenix! Although I haven't been to every sushi restaurant out here, of the many many that I've tried I always find myself coming back to this one especially when I am just not in the mood to be disappointed. They have great customer service, very attentive servers. Their rolls are rolled to perfection-- just the right size with a balance ratio of fish to rice. Very flexible with substitution on their special rolls, a wide range when it comes to variety of rolls, and food is always fresh. Good service, easy-going, delicious, and affordable, you really can't ask for much more.

My favorite boba spot in Phoenix! Huge variety on their menu, reasonable pricing, friendly service, cute quirky decor nice place to just hang out with friends after a meal at any one of the restaurants at Mekong Plaza. Their mango snow with condensed milk is to die for! Other favs: Thai tea with boba, House Cocktail, Coconut Cream with grass jelly, must-trys!
