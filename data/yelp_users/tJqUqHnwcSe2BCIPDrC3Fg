My expectations got dumped on after I came to Welcome Diner. We came for some passable late night grub. Instead we got kickass grub and some really nice drinks.  Of course we come on a Tuesday - clearly the best day because it was happy hour all day. Between my group we had a Hurricane, Gin and Tonic, Whiskey Sour, a Little Birdy, and an order of Poutine.  Happy hour drinks at $5-6, you don't expect much. But these staples actually hold their own against bars that would sell theirs for $10+. The gin and tonic was refreshing with the addition of lime juice. The Whiskey Sour had a nice balanced tart flavor from the fruit. And the Hurricane was basically alcoholic juicy goodness.  From the food, literally comfort food at its finest. The Little Birdy - that in house biscuit, plus that awesome succulent fried chicken and slice of cheese - some of the best $5 I've ever spent. And the Poutine is glorious. Probably some of the most conservative, it's close to the traditional sense of just gravy and cheese, but they opt to use a peppery country style gravy and cheddar cheese. It's makes you feel a little worse and better at the same time.  The fact that this place is basically in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood actually added to the appeal for me. It's a bright spot with outdoor seating that makes you want to have a good time. Can't wait to come back.

You only need to know three words walking into TEXAZ Grill: chicken fried steak. It's a huge monster, with a crispy double dipped batter layer encasing a beautiful tenderized steak, smothered with a beautiful white gravy. Without a doubt TEXAZ Grill has the best chicken fried steak in the Phoenix area, perhaps even Arizona!  Portions are huge too! The dinner portion actually gives you two steaks while the lunch portion gives you one. The coleslaw and mashed potatoes on the side were huge as well.  The restaurant is a bit small and the parking lot a bit smaller, but the interior is definitely cozy and the staff is very friendly. It really makes the meal worth it on top of the kick*** CFS. You NEED to try this out!

Stopped by here for a quick lunch. Looks like a great diversified menu with plenty to eat! It'll take several visits to try everything you want, but I'll base this review on just one.  We had the saganaki (Flaming feta) for an appetizer. While the taste of the dish was solely melted feta with a little oil, watching the guy light it on fire right besides your table was just awesome.   I personally got the Chicago gyro with fries. The gyro meat was nice and crispy, while the flavors balanced quite nicely. The sauce falling off the pita actually made it more enjoyable, I'd say. The fries were also pretty crispy.  Good value lunch, and I would recommend if you're looking for a fix in the area.

So I really wanted to visit my friend in California, but I was tired of walking and driving. My friend told me about something called airplanes, and told me to find that at an "airport."  The nice people at the ticket counter even checked in my 49.5 pound bag, and some friendly people ran a security checkpoint to make sure I left my weapons at home. Security must be very popular because there's always a line whenever I go.  The trip between states was definitely faster than anything I had ever walked. 10/10 would use again.

When buying personal scrubs, it's hard to find many options outside online. However, Scrubs and Beyond offered a wide variety of options that met my needs.  At the time there was a marketed emphasis for recent graduates and nurses, but as a medical researcher, I felt just as welcome looking for scrubs. The staff was very friendly in helping me look for specific features, such as specific pockets or pants without the front tie and only the waistband.  I suppose price is relatively reasonable. Besides the $5 sales rack, a standard top and pants pair cost about $20 each, with quality exceeding the generic scrubs found in the hospital. There was a wide variety of colors too. Whether you need a pair of scrubs for your new job or you want to cosplay doctors for some reason, Scrubs and Beyond is a very convenient location for your scrub shopping needs.

Very good laser tag place, I've been here with friends, even celebrated my birthday here!  The arena itself is very well designed. Lots of walkways, multiple levels, sniper towers, and plenty small corners to hide! There's also the base system, if you're unaware with that. Sure, you can shoot your opponent for 100 points, but all three teams (red, yellow, blue) have two bases, totally six, meaning four enemy bases. You shoot these bases, you get a whopping 2,000!!!! Now keep in mind the bases will shortly shoot back on deactivation, making you inactive much longer than if someone shot you. That sucks.  Birthday packs are awesome! You're guaranteed one if you reserve a package, but since there were only two birthdays that day and my friends and I got unlimited (more on that later), the staff bro was chill enough to give me the remaining pack! Basically it's a rapid fire gun (muahaha) that makes your shot opponents' packs sing happy birthday every time they're shot by you. Psychological torture more than anything, but it's fun =D  Prices can be sold by game. Obviously, the more games you buy the cheaper it is. Best deals are the weekend unlimited packs. Last I was there, there was Saturday 8-12 PM and Sunday 1-6 PM. Always went sunday, $24.99 unlimited! You stay the entire time, you can easily play over 10 games, as each game is about 20 minutes. Fun stuff, huh?  You can also get a membership. $19.99 gives you a little device that when you put it on your pack, changes it to your custom name! So rather than Red 4 or Blue 19, it's essentially a "gamertag" if you will. You also get access to special events and more. Not sure on the longevity of the membership, but it's cool nevertheless.  There's also an arcade if you're bored. Decent selection, DDR, ticket games, and what not.  Very solid experience if you're looking for some fun in the area. I would suggest going during the unlimited times to guarantee people to play against.

I've eaten sushi all over the country, and Hiro Sushi is hands down the best sushi in Arizona.  The location is a bit hidden away within the shopping center, and walking inside there aren't that many tables, but this smaller size gives more attention to the customer, and it results in great service from the staff!  I find that almost everything I order here is great. Everything is made consistently fresh and great regardless of time of year.   Hiro Sushi is also great for Japanese cuisine in general! The noodle soups and soba are other dishes I frequent, and there are excellent lunch and dinner packages that come with rice, soup, and salad.  My recommendation? Go for the specials! The fried fish and teapot soup are very light and tasty. Don't be afraid to ask for something that isn't there! Chances are if you ask the waitress they still have plenty of that favorite dish coming up!  It gets very crowded on a weeknight, so because of the small size of the restaurant, be sure to make a reservation a couple hours in advance. It's painful to wait an hour and watch people eat their fantastic food!  It's a bit expensive compared to happy hours at other places, but who eats sushi to SAVE money? Hiro is truly quality over quantity, and I have never felt I've wasted a single dollar.

I think it really depends on what you order here. The wings are of the soggy kind, not the crispy, which I prefer. The pizza also looked average. Can't comment on the drinks since I can't order them yet.  However, I am a big fan of their cheesesteaks. They're pretty big and reasonably priced. I always get either a mushroom cheesesteak with fried onions or a cheesesteak hoagie with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. Good sides have included standard fries, fried mushrooms and zucchini, cheese steaks, and even chicken tenders for the lol.  I think it's a good place for groups, and I've always been able to get a table. I've come for dinner and late at night, and takeout is always pretty quick.

Food's closer to three and a half stars but that's alright.  The standard pizza is a thin crust style, I know I've seen someone expect something else every time I dine here. It's good, don't get me wrong, but I don't think everyone prefers thin crust over a standard crust.  The Chicago stuffed pizza is freaking huge, and it takes a while too! Considering there's a wait no matter what time I come, there's an option to order a stuffed pizza to cook while you wait. It's really nice because the pizza is ready as soon as we sit down!  I think the sweet potato fries are really good, slight hint of spices give a needed kick. Also the calamari's great. It's crispy but not oily.  And they have pizookies. I don't think anyone can really contest gooey cookie in a pan with ice cream on top.  Service is pretty friendly, but I don't think this restaurant is good at accommodating huge groups. The tables can't really take more than 6-8 at most, and they're either booths are round tables, not the kind you can squeeze together.  If your party is small and you crave Italian, nothing wrong with Oregano's.

This is an excellent location for kids gatherings. There are a wide variety of kid games, the location is spacious, and more than everything the venue is clean. I wouldn't count on the taste since the pizza tastes like cardboard at kid pizzarias but that's okay! As long as the kids are happy you should be fine, and I think you can accomplish that at PPP.

I don't really know what makes good or bad fast food, but I've never had bad service here. They've always been friendly in the drive through, which I guess is the most anyone could ask for!  The 24 hours doesn't hinder on service at all, which is why I still go during those odd hours.

Breakfast burritos are GODLY!!! Huge, cheap, flavorful - combined with their fresh diablo or tomatillo salsa makes one of the best meals you can get. Better yet, they're served all day until late night closing!  Cheap, awesome Mexican food with a drive thru open as late as 3am, Senor Taco has always been worth the drive for me. From carne asada fries to shrimp tacos, I have eaten here dozens of times and have never had anything but great food.  There are various happy hour specials and deals to make your meal even more affordable. There is literally nothing on the menu over $10, and most is between $5-7.  My personal recommendations are limited to breakfast burritos since their classic menu is pretty damn good, but try either the Hash Brown burrito or the Chorizo and Egg. Heck, get the double wrapped Grande if you want to kill your stomach. The California Surfing burrito is also killer, shrimp and carne asada. Take the hit to your calories, because this place is probably the best Mexican I've had in miles.

It's a pretty decent high school. The mascot is the Firebird. Size is about 2,000. Football team is consistently above average, and there are a decent number of AP courses. There are a wide spread of clubs, and it's relatively easy to create a new one. Like all schools, some teachers are obviously much better than others. Recently the campus has been renovated. Looks brand new, but from the outside it's pretty unfriendly.  This is a public school within the SUSD, and recently allowed open enrollment. At the time of this writing, the admistration is undergoing changes, so not much is known for the future of Chaparral. There are enough opportunities at Chaparral to create your future, with as much success as scholar or athlete as you desire.

Again, I'm not sure why Yelp encourages double pages for the location, the only difference being abbreviations within the street address.  When the restaurant opened almost ten years ago, it was great! Management was friendly towards people of all ages, prices were cheap, and pizza and wings were excellent. I remember Amore working out a deal with my cousin's middle school for pizza Fridays, and all the kids appreciated it.  I'm not sure when the change happened, within five years ago, or if there was another change after that. After the original owner changed hands for the restaurant, things took a turn for the worse. Employees eventually consisted of teenagers looking for extra cash instead of the workers who put their heart in soul in cooking, delivery, and service. The food quality also was much more sloppy, and prices steadily raised over the years.  Now it's just another greedy restaurant. If Amore were in its original hands, it'd still be one of the best places for pizza in Scottsdale. Now it just blows.

High end and authentic is all I can think of in regards to the Persian Room.  The ambiance is just spectacular for a weeknight dinner with friends, or even for couples.  All the appetizers are definitely worth trying, and the staff seems like is always wating to refill your drinks and the delicious pita bread to no end!  The entrees are amazing. The lunch portions are huge with rice and salad, and the dinner portions even bigger! I've eaten at a lot of places, but I can never seem to finish my entree! Ah well, that just means I can enjoy more at home =)  The price is a bit higher, but it's to be expected if you want to dine on food with class.

This service here has been very friendly. The manager at the time was this super friendly old man that kind of reminded me of Santa Claus.  On one particular occasion, one of the workers screwed up my combo and didn't give me fries. Like what the hell, right? Anyways I walk inside the store, and some scumbag just gives me the stink eye. Then out of nowhere, BOOM Santa Claus comes in and gives me a large for free.  If you're wavering on what fast food eat, come here just because of Santa Claus working here.

As a Vietnamese person myself, I'm pretty sure I can recognize good pho. While I am well aware California is the best for pho, as a resident of Arizona I think Khai Hoan is excellent.  The pho broth is nice and light. Also, the Mi Xao is done excellently. I always order the appetizer sampler with my brother (Spring roll, egg rolls, crab puff, and fried shrimp) and the variety of flavors was superb! The prices are relatively cheap too - which is a good thing as it's a 10 minute walk from ASU and accesible by the light rail.  It's a bit of a mixed opinion here, but my friends ordered Chinese food at this Vietnamese restaurant (-_-;) and I got conflicting opinions. One guy said that his was awesome, while the other said some of his chicken was uncooked. However, I get fried rice from time to time, and that's done perfectly.  If this is your first time, I suggest starting with the pho tai (#3). If you're THE culinary expert on pho and don't like it, just shut up and eat. As of now it's the best pho in Arizona, and it's a nice change of flavor for those who haven't eaten Vietnamese in a while, or ever!

I went today with three friends for dinner around 6 PM Sunday night. Though it seemed quite busy, I was pleased to get a seat within two minutes upon arrival. Outside seating, despite a hot Arizona summer, was pretty nice with shade. However, this is where the pleasanties end.  Our table remain neglected for approximately twenty minutes. No one bothered to offer us drinks, and it was quite irritating to see tables who arrived after us being served appetizers. When our waiter came, he did not even apologize for the wait, and we gave our orders: drinks, appetizers, and pita sandwiches.  The hummus and garlic dip came relatively quickly, only twenty minutes later. Both were alright, but something is seriously wrong if all of us were only served one pita with the two dips, and each dip was more than twice the size of the pita. We asked our waiter for extra pita, and he kindly agreed. The entire duration of dinner, it never came.  Refills were also a pain, as we would ask someone to fetch our waiter, and he wouldn't come until ten minutes later.  An hour after ordering could not possibly justify only four meager gyro sandwiches. I've been to plenty of other businesses who have made that kind of order and more in just ten minutes during a busy lunch hour. Half the tables outside already left, including tables that arrived after us, and we were the last ones served. The food was of average quality, and I've been to better with cheaper prices.  Slightly expensive, I can see as justified. But many agree that time is worth much more than money. I had an excessive amount, over an hour and a half, wasted on a decellerating Sunday night. Staff is kind of nice, but I suggest a serious change in priorities so that first time customers like myself aren't immediately turned off. I can say for certain that I'm never coming here again, and I'll find myself at better places much closer to home.

Probably the BEST cheesesteaks I've had in the area were from this joint. I love the environment, got that bar and the pool table. Really nice that it's open 24/7.  Love the classic steaks with whiz. Fries are really good too, crisp and fresh cut. And if you haven't had the macaroni bites, try it because it's delicious.

I must've come here a year ago with my entire family. Had to make a reservation for 8 through the Yelp system. The reservation worked, and we managed to get our same day reservation in a full house.   Everything here was really good, the food definitely fits the ambiance and the excellent level of service. The sides, the appetizers, and the entrees are all excellent. I'm pretty sure the sides are huge as well. The only strong memory I remember from Ocean Club is my halibut entree, which is somewhat unfortunately. While the grilling was spot on, for some reason I found my fillet lacked flavor, whether that be from the fish or the lack of seasoning I have no idea.  If it weren't for being jealous of everyone else's entrees, I probably would've given Maestro's a 5 star review. It's classy and it's affordable, I highly recommend it.

Very friendly staff at the movie theatre. On one occasion, was literally the only person left in the theatre for Monsters University for the after the credits scene (you should check on that before you watch your movie) and the cleaning staff made sure to not obstruct my view at all. Everyone one of them said "thank you" too but that's probably just company policy.  Given the atmosphere of Desert Ridge, AMC is great for movie after dinner. The theatres are all decently sized as well.

I love Costco. Buying products at a cheaper price in bulk is a great model for larger families. The cafeteria is also great for cheap eats, don't even need to be a member!  I only regret that the video game section has gone down the drain. What used to provide competitive console bundles and mainstream titles has dwindled down to maybe two games no one has ever heard of. Damn shame if you ask me.

Pardon my lack of details, but I've been here multiple times over the past couple of years, and I feel the need to write a review!  Everytime I've been here, it's been in groups, and every dinner has been excellent. It's more of the traditional Chinese fare, and it works wonders how everyone orders their own dishes and splits. The food quality has been excellent. Personally, I go for their fried rice and their soups, but everything on the menu is pretty damn good, as far as I can tell.  Prices were decent, and the staff were pretty attentive with refills and such. Then again, I always try to come on the off hours. If you make a reservation in advance, it works wonders!  I think it's one of the most reasonable Chinese food locations in the area, and I've already recommended it to my friends.

I don't know why I haven't written a review for this place yet. Literally the best place to get Chinese food in Tempe. Cheap price, great taste, and that's it!  Yes, I didn't mention the service. It's a bit subpar and you tend to get ignored on busier days. Heck, we even refilled our water ourselves on multiple occasions.  But I still give this place 5 stars because the food is THAT GOOD! Great for college students, you can get five huge entrees for 32 bucks with rice, fried rice, and noodles! That's twice the size you would get for a Panda Express meal per person!  My favorites by far are the salt and pepper squid and the Peking style spare ribs but almost everything here is amazing. Also this place sucks for groups bigger than eight.

I love this place whenever I need a quick bite, especially happy hour!  The wings here are cooked to be nice and juicy on the inside, but crispy on the outside! I am a fan of the golden variety, which has the same spice levels as your classic wings, but is a bit sweeter. I'd advise coming to specials, happy hours and select nights, to get a dozen wings for 5 bucks. Sweet deal!  The homemade onion rings here are perhaps the best I've eaten, and the burgers are great for a good bite. I don't know about other people, but my BBQ Bacon Burger was cooked evenly to a medium rare consistency, which I liked.  The staff is decent, and the time for food and refills is short even on busy nights!  I'm not even a sports fan, but I can dig this sports grill.

I'm a bit sad that they are moving to a bigger location at Shea and the 101, but Jessica Knits offered everything I needed as an amateur knitter. Compared to a general arts store like Michael's the variety in yarn and tools is HUGE! Felt like a kid in a candy store everything I went.  That in addition to great service encouraged me to keep knitting. Highly recommend this location for knitters of all backgrounds.

Honestly, I don't know why there's two different pages for the same restaurant, but regardless this restaurant is CLOSED!  I would've given the restaurant three stars for inconsistent service, but hurry up and mark this closed so you don't give false hope of close seafood.

This theatre is pretty solid, considering it's at a very popular shopping center and near ASU!  Foodfare is solid, theatres are clean, and the select of movies is always bigger than other theatres. I've seen a decent number of limited releases here.   Great place to go out with friends, family, or forever alone T_T

I don't know what needs to be said specifically about BJ's. It's a classic American restaurant/brewery chain. The menu is solid all around, the service is outstanding, and the root beer is amazing.  If classic American cuisine is what you're craving and you're in the area, BJ's is not a bad choice by any means. Although the chicken fried steak was a bit chewy compared to my liking.

I love sushi... but I'm pretty sure I won't be coming back here by myself.  Happy hour has decent prices, and the sushi is alright. Some rolls were better made than others, and it seems to me the quality was inconsistent.  Based on food alone, I'd give it three stars, but the service was mediocre. We asked for waters, and that took our waitress ten minutes to retrieve. We asked for a couple minutes to look over the menu, but our waitress didn't even return for over twenty minutes!!! It's ridiculous, our food would have been served by now at plenty of other places.   It gets worse. Seven of us ordered regular rolls, and one ordered hers tempura style. We also got an order of tempura vegetables. Those came out five minutes after we ordered, which was nice, and the tempura roll that my friend ordered came out shortly after. Everything else... came 35 minutes later. I timed it just because how ridiculous it was - everything was devoured, and only half of us got refills once! Yes it's nice to serve the same style rolls at the same time, but such a huge difference is inexcusable. At the very least they should have delayed my friend's tempura roll (and she agrees!).  This place advertises ambience as it's selling point, but it was average. There was only ONE table in the entire restaurant that could seat more than four people! Ambience if useless if it isn't practical.  I'm never voting to come here again, even if my sushi were free.

I can only comment on the lunch portion given take out, but the portions are pretty big and tasty.  My usual is the gyros plate, came with pita, basmati rice, side salad, and a whole roasted tomato. The meat are just four giant strips of meat diagonal on the to go box, and they had the right amount of salt as well as crispiness from the rotisserie process.  I had the appetizer combo plate once dining in, but the tray is huge! Would not recommend tackling with a party under four people.  For a $10 meal, the gyros plate was very good. I'm pretty sure you get more pita when you eat in, so make sure you do if you want to try out this awesome Persian cuisine!

Quality gyros for quality prices.  I am a huge lover of Greek food, especially gyros. I've been to almost all Greek locations in Scottsdale to satisfy that craving. I've got to say, this is in my top two choices.  Ordering a classic gyro will give you plenty of succulent meat. The salads will have just the right amount of dressing, a problem I've seen at plenty of other Greek restaurants. You can't go wrong with the value meal, with the gyros sandwich, fries, and a drink. The dinner platter is equally worth it, coming with an excellent rice pilaf and a mini salad.  Thankfully this location is near my house, so I try to frequent it at least once a week after work. I've taken friends and family, and they all love it! If you're in the mood for a low key bite of Greek flavor in Scottsdale, I'd put my vote here.

Very decent rice plates at reasonable prices. I've come here multiple times when it's busy to order take out, and it still gets done in under 10 minutes! Steaming hot when I pick it up, and still very hot after a 30 minute drive home!

From the perspective of a farmer's market frequenter, Old Town Scottsdale finds a way to keep it fresh.  In terms of the produce, you can definitely taste the difference in quality when you bring the food home. For this basic quality of farmer's markets, this location does well.  What I find amazing here is the wide diversity of prepared food here! Not just the variety of bakeries, there are so many places to grab a good bite, with cuisines ranging from Mexican to Mediterranean. You may even find niche items like compound butters or creme brulee!   Even for those who do not cook very often, these other venues allow people of all ages and culinary background to enjoy Old Town Scottsdale's farmer's market.  (On a side note, check the website for the calender. Hours can vary depending on the month, but this will always take place on Saturday).

Fogo de Chao reaffirmed that I love meat. Thank you so freaking much!  I will say that the integrated Yelp reservation system does wonders, I highly recommend it.  The meal comes in two phases: salad bar and served meat. You'll get some side dishes, and meat carvers will come to your table to offer you various cuts and cooking temperatures. They actually carve a different part of the meat block depending what you want, which I thought was really cool. Technically they're only supposed to come when the card they give you is green instead of red, but they came nonstop anyways and I love them for it.  Keep in mind with this high end service and variety of meats the meal will be somewhat expensive, around the $50 range. However, if you haven't gone I suggest you do, because this sits at my Top 5 Restaurants of all time right now.   And as much as you love meat... please don't come alone. The more the merrier, otherwise you'll just look like a sad pig rolling in the mud.

Seriously, this place is called Omega GYROS, and everyone's giving lower ratings solely for the other entrees! I'm telling you, for Gyros, this place is legit!  I'm a huge fan of family run places, and for better or worse it shows! There is SO much more meat compared to other locations, and it's so juicy! Eating in, they give you a whole ketchup style bottle of tzatziki, so you can season both your fries and gyro however you want!  There are a couple drawbacks. If you order the dinner portion, you can only choose rice, salad, or fries; as opposed to other locations that give you both rice and salad. However, whatever you choose they give you a LOT! Also, they recently restricted drinks to one refill, which is kind of silly but more than enough for me.  If this place weren't so far away, I'd go multiple times a week! Best gyros I've ever eaten! Hopefully it stays running for a very long time.

Sure it's your generic more expensive supermarket with more brands and options - that you can find everywhere. However, the service here is really top notch, definitely amongst the most friendly I've ever frequented.  Heck, I even screwed up one time and dropped a four pack, but they helped me sift through the embarrassment, cleaned it up, and immediately retrieved another without asking. I literally could not ask for more because they already did it! That service alone is what keeps me coming back.

The food here is top notch, don't know where to find better chicken and waffles. I keep coming back, but there's something wrong when I have bad service over half the time.  I don't know what the deal is, but on more than one occasion we've had unpleasant waiters/waitresses. I don't ask for much at restaurants, but reflling water or asking for a couple more minutes to look at the menu should not warrant a skank face. Maybe the serving staff had a bad day... multiple times... during the same week...  Eh, who knows. I guess that makes it a "legitimate" Southern experience, but regions don't excuse poor service. I suggest going for the classic combo, but don't be surprised if things go south from there...

Geez guys, someone explain the hate!  I've been here perhaps six or seven times with friends/family, and will probably go again relatively soon. Service was never particularly bad for me, and they always came to check on us, manager included, when the restaurant was busy or practically empty!  Food's decent, with reasonable prices for BBQ, wings, and more, but the extra star comes from the variety of flavors you can get! I usually get some sort of mix of mild, parmesan garlic, and a dry rub.   This is solid American dining in my book. If your experience is similar to mine, you can't really go wrong with BWW.

Service is getting bad after a couple years. Relatively been ignored multiple visits, and have never been offered a water refill after the glass being empty for 20 minutes. The food's still good, but I take back what I said of relatively good service. Depending on the night I wouldn't expect much...

Came here with my bro since we got a gift card for Christmas, so my expectations for the meal were low/average. However, I thoroughly enjoyed everything I ate at Dominick's and was very satisfied with the friendly natural service and the taste of the food.  Start off with the bread. They have several flavors, of which we opted for sea salt and butter. I'll be straight with you, this is probably the best free bread I've ever had at dinner. The rolls are served monkey bread style in a hot cast iron pan. From the richness of the salt and butter on the outer layer to the soft bread on the inside, this was a perfect fusion of dinner roll and pretzels. Would love to try to other flavors - but unfortunately I ate three pieces by myself.  Our appetizer was the shrimp and calamari combo. Two seafoods, three sauces, one solid dish. You get a solid portion of both proteins. While the sauces are somewhat basic from ketchup to some sort of remoulade, they were all enjoyable. Gotta love the banana peppers slipped in there as well.  Now for the main attraction and the sides. My bro got the bone out rib-eye Oscar style (crab cake, asparagus, and hollandaise) while I got the hefty bone in version. Both medium rare, and well seasoned compared to some other name steakhouses in the area.  My bro is still a little bro, so the least adventurous sides he could eat were steamed broccoli and truffle fries. With the small version of each, that should have been plenty. The broccoli was a manageable size but came with hollandaise sauce to dip (say what!?). The truffle fries seemed much bigger by comparison, and I like how neither the truffle nor the cheese was overpowering.   If you order any kind of appetizer, I would recommend one side at most for two people. Otherwise two could be fine.  I came in expecting some okay overpriced food, but honestly I loved everything here. Would love to come back on my own dime and take the family on a special occasion.

Went here with the family for a weeknight dinner, crowd wasn't too bad. There didn't seem to be that many tables, but considering it's a small restaurant, I guess that's okay. For a family owned business, I think it's solid.  Decor seemed very nice, wasn't overdone. Main menu is not overwhelming, just four different pages for appetizers, salads, pizza, pasta and chef entrees. Appreciated that most of these dishes had mainly English names. As much as I love Italian food, I can't pronounce most of my favorite dishes!  Let's break it down by courses. For appetizers, we got the bruschetta and calamari. Calamari was crisp and light, not drenched in oil like other places can do. The cajun sauce was well too. As for the bruschetta, they didn't skimp out on the toppings at all! I felt like it was a monster of a piece, with tomatoes falling off mid-bite. Might be a bit messy, but I liked it!  Did I mention the free bread. Pretty sure we got some pesto butter, and three varieties of bread that were foccacia, wheat, and white.  I ordered a side salad with my main dish. Wide variety of dressings, but I decided to change my traditional balsamic to their apple cider vinegarette. I will say it's VERY sweet just like the drink, so I was glad they kept the dressing on the side. Interesting take I haven't seen yet.  My main course was the Veal Piccata. Warning, I found their portions to be VERY BIG. The veal was cooked nicely, sauce wasn't overwhelming. The side of spaghetti was cooked decently, though it felt like it was something I could've done at home. The roasted vegetables looked fine, but I didn't have enough room to finish my meal,  I think the prices were justified, about $100 for the family of four, with an ice tea and beer included. Staff was friendly, food was good. Not sure if I'd come back here, but I didn't regret it.

Rehab Burger has time and time again given me great tasting burger combinations with wacky toppings that I enjoy. Everything I've had here is flavorful yet very distinct from other burger joints - not an uncommon cuisine by any means - with reasonable pricing and a cool vibe.  I like the environment, with the chill surfer decor. With tables and high tops it doesn't feel crowded at all. Although I find it extremely difficult to fit large groups - most tables are arranged for a size of 4. I just eat here with a couple friends so not my concern.  Back to the burgers - fantastic. They have innovative toppings like the PB&J Bacon Burger with sriracha and Ghost Burger with ghost pepper jack. Ghost's my favorite, and the pepper jack is definitely elevated compared to jalapenos but not like sign-a-waiver hot.  My favorites here have been off the menu specials. They have a Mac and Cheese Burger with hatch chill M&C pouring off the patty - twice the radius of the burger itself. And the weekend burger that's essential egg's benedict on a burger.   Get me a 10 oz Rehab size of any of those with my sweet potato tots and I will always leave super satisfied.

This restaurant replaced the Wendy's that was once here, and is currently the only option for food in the D-terminal. I ordered take out once, service was terrible, and I'm never coming back.  I give it a try, so I order the Torta del Barrio to go, with fries. It's a vegetarian option for $13, including cheese stuffed peppers among other vegetables. One gentleman was in front of me, so I wait after my order.  Three people order after me within 15 minutes, each ordering items on the menu of similar preparation (one even got the same dish). They were ALL SERVED BEFORE ME! I ended up waiting for 35 minutes for a meal that wasn't even that good. The fries were soggy and bland, and the bread for the torta tasted stale. No way that cost $13, I could've made that for under $5.  The restaurant didn't look that much better. The place was packed, and they pumped out a couple dishes every 10 minutes. The majority of tables were not served the entire time I was there, and they definitely ordered before I arrived.  When you're trying to fly out, you want a quick bite to eat. The 35 minutes wait was inexcusable, especially since all those customers were served until I was dead last. The most I got out of the cashier was "Sorry, I tried." If you're going to serve food at the airport, that kind of service won't cut it.  I've never said this before, but I'd have preferred fast food at the time.

I came here with a friend for happy hour on a Monday, and I came and left and very happy man. Typically Monday-Friday 3-6, it was a dollar off tap beers and appetizers, which is pretty much everything I would get here regardless. The menu includes pizzas for dinner options.  Monday at 5:30 was surprisingly empty - yet when we left around 6:30 place was almost packed. Maybe people don't get beers and just get pizza?  For apps my friend shared the Irish Nachos. Basically the happy marriage between loaded potato skins and nachos, this dish I think is the standout on the menu for the reason and the one we'd get every time.  Apparently the menu rotates very fast according to some Yelpers, and true enough I can't find some of the drinks I really enjoyed. I really liked the Export Stout - good hints of a coffee like flavor without too much going on. I had a Hefeweizen I really liked too but it's off the menu and I can't find the name.   I think this is a really nice place for the area, not as overwhelmed as other places like fourth peaks with decent bites and beers. With Raising Cane's across the street now, Fate North looks like it's headed towards my favorite's in North Scottsdale.

Closer to two and a half. I think this place has a great vibe and the concept is hilariously awesome. Just the execution of some of our dishes were so-so. Definitely think I could bump up the rating after another visit but this is where I currently stand.  Starting with the drink I ordered, the Maggie. Strawberry and lilikoi are some of my favorite flavors in sweets. But my table and I could agree that the dominating flavors were tequila and OJ. My friend ordered the hard root beer, and it's what you expect except slightly disappointing. Maybe we just suck at picking drinks, I don't know.  We started with the bone marrow since it was a popular mentioned item here. Two thick bones, with buttered toast, okra pickles, and "peperonata" that was basically red pepper pesto. The bone marrow was bomb, but I think buttering the toast makes it overkill on the fats. I think toasted bread alone would be great.  My main item was a build your own burger, medium, with duck egg and pork belly, plus tots instead of fries or salad. The tots are amazing, you get two giant stuffed whoppers of amazing potato goodness. Got hints of cheese or something else, it's not just fried mashed potatoes. Definitely worth it in my opinion, but you might get slightly less mass than ordering fries.  What was disappointing was the burger itself. The duck egg was clutch with a runny yolk, and you get a huge slab of pork belly. But the patty itself was underdone for both me and another mate. Mine was between medium rare and rare even though I ordered medium. My friend ordered medium rare but his was underdone as well. With the burger too soft, the runny yolk that's normally awesome become unpleasant to eat. Maybe it's an off day, but 0/2 isn't too hot.   I think this place is a bit pricey, but those tots and burger I did manage to enjoy were great. I'd love to come back and have my faith restored, but my dinner was on a shaky note.

I was a bit sad since I used to frequent the Uncle Sam's that was here, but all my regrets are definitely gone. Portillo's is a sick joint and I hope it's here to stay.  Taking down the restaurant decor for a very open counter service restaurant. Akin to something like Five Guys, you can view the entire line of cooks from grill to tray service along half the perimeter. They even have a separate counter for serving desserts.   The title suggests hot dogs is the main attraction, but from what everyone's been ordering and what the staff tells me, the Italian beef attracts the most customers. The gravy is excellent, and the beef while succelent embodied all the classic flavors every Italian beef fan loves. The bread does the sandwich justice, but it's good but not great. I personally like the combo, which comes with an entire sausage in addition to the beef.  The sides are not something to shirk at either. The onion rings are super crispy and the crinkle fries work well with dat cheese whiz.   To top everything off, this entire restaurant even has a drive thru, which totally works!  The menu is huge, so I'm far from exhausting my limit here. I hear the salads are pretty good, and I've got to try the namesake dish eventually. However, it's really hard to stay away from the Italian beef every time I come back.

This place was suprisingly good amongst the Americanized Asian fusion places I've been to. Ordered 3 or 4 of the noodle dishes, all were solid. The kimchee rice balls were solid as an appetizer. The Vietnamese iced coffee, while great to drink, is really too sweet for me to consider authentic but I'll drink it anyways!  Various Asian elements are here, but I've seen more Vietnamese than at other locations. Noodle dishes were fine, haven't tried the pho, and I would not suggest banh mi if you wanted something close to the real deal. Then again, you wouldn't be here if you wanted the real deal =D  For an easy lunch that's different from the everyday sandwich or hamburger, Wok Box has my endorsement.

Wow, Arizona finally has a decent ramen shop, I'm impressed. The variety of broths is good and the toppings were excellent.  Place is in a crap location though. I think the address is misleading and it's hard to find. It's in the same complex as Ike's, Steak and Shake, etc. It's probably close to 7th street than 6th. It's right behind the down ramp into the parking garage on 7th street and really close to church.  Now back to the food. I got Paitan - which was super flavorful pork and chicken bone. Definitely a stronger broth than what I got at Republic Ramen. The toppings I opted for were chashu, soft egg, and garlic paste. The chashu was almost melt in your mouth with the beautiful fat marbling. And who doesn't love breaking into the rich yolk of a soft boiled egg. And as for the garlic, I got a decent smear on the side of the bowl, but not sure if I'd pay for it again.  Due to the customization, it was a little pricey at 12. However, they have cheaper options - a $10 special for chef ramen picks, sake, and a beer. I think it's good food to have if you don't want to get shit faced on Mill. Or just want good ramen.

Been having hair cuts here for as long as I remember, and it's freaking great.  It's always been run by the same Vietnamese sisters, who are super friendly even if you only speak English! Even if you have no idea what you want, I have always found their suggestions to be good.  Relatively cheap haircut too, $8 for a men's cut, sometimes they'll even throw in the shampoo free of charge! Given this great location for milk tea and other Asian food, Teazer's has always been my go to location for hair cuts. If you're in the area, I say give it a try!

Pretty glad this is next to a somewhat packed brunch place. Parking it harder, but that usually guarantees this steal has no wait!  Can't comment too much on the pho itself since I didn't get it. Had some of my bro's soup and it tasted pretty solid - would be very happy ordering some myself.  But the stuff I did order - I think definitely warrants a return visit. The nem nuong was very well composed with a great dipping sauce. The Mi Xao Don definitely ranks in my top ever in AZ - probably the best sauce for sure, on top of the excellent noodles and seafood stir fry.   I don't want to be too verbose on this review, but Pho Viet Nam definitely lives up to the rating and ranks up there for really solid Vietnamese food in the area.

tl;dr - lots of great cocktails to choose from, great tasting but a little overpriced food, and very helpful service staff.  My first experience with sit down cocktails was traumatizing, but I definitely enjoyed Bitter & Twisted. It's a great place to take a cozy group of 4 or less; maybe 6 for a special occasion or if you don't mind waiting.  The menu is super helpful for providing options for you - must be over 100 drinks at least. If you don't know what you want, you can tell the servers what kind of drink you want or something similar, and they can either point you towards a menu cocktail that fits the bill or custom make the drink as needed. A lot of options for spirits here, so I think you'll be set.   I like citrus, so I opted for both the Limoncetta and the Lemongrass Collins, one of their top 10 most popular. The first is great if you love that lemon flavor - because that's ALL you're getting! As for the lemongrass, while the glass is much taller with the ice, I definitely feel is more balanced and I can see why it's popular. Both are very refreshing if you're into that.  Can't vouch for my friends' quality of drinks, I just know one of them had absinthe.  As for the food, it's hit or miss for size but I wouldn't come here on an empty stomach. The brisket tacos are a fantastic appetizer but they won't fill you up - each taco is a size of a coaster. The Chips and Fish are a much better bang for your buck if you want food. Honestly I'd come having eaten already or get something quick afterwards.  I wish college towns offered more places like Bitter & Twisted. It's a nice chill place to socialize, the drinks are well made, and you probably won't get shit faced on cheap bud light.

From solely the drinking experience, O.H.S.O offers a great time with a good selection of brews and whiskeys.  My bros and I had our fill of Four Peaks and wanted to find the next location. Luckily our next stop was practically next door. On a late Saturday night O.H.S.O was relatively empty compared to Four Peaks, but I don't think that's indicative of the quality at all.  In terms of the beers, there's a good variety from in house brews, local AZ, and across the country. The Orange Blossom pint was really nice, and my friends and I can vouch for their Hef and the Blackberry Sour from out of state.  Whether it's the brews or the hard stuff, what I really appreciated was how real the guys behind the bar were. They weren't afraid to tell you if something was absolutely awful - we mutually agreed to rename one of the whiskeys "Gasoline" for good reason.  This place has a good vibe. From what I saw from the other customers the food looked bomb as well. For somewhere that started as my number 2 stop it definitely became my number 1 for the night. Looking forward to coming again soon!

Always been a fan of Senor Taco - hands down best breakfast burritos I've ever had in the southwest. But I'm just so lazy when it comes to driving and Fountain hills is way too far for me.  Thankfully this location is still going strong near Raintree and 101. It still has all the great selections from the other locations - the great burritos, a killer diablo salsa, and great prices and specials. What I especially like are additional options like half orders of carne asada fries - they're great but nobody ain't got time for that by themselves.  Personal recommendations? My favorite is the hash brown burrito - great amounts of everything and a really flavorful sausage I can't pinpoint at any other restaurant I've been to. Chorizo and egg is packed to the brim of course. And the diablo salsa is a must - a great kick and addition to any burrito.

Decent selection of beer here, but I'm a very big fan of the food. You get huge portions, and it tastes great.  Definitely a fan of their more edgy dishes. For once, their poutine is one of the most authentic I've had from the brown gravy to the cheese curds. The giant tater tots are a perfect marriage between loaded potato skins and tots. The house jerky is a great peppery bite. And the triple cooked wings maintain a great smoky flavor - though I do warn against chef's whim - sometimes that whim means no sauce at all!  In terms of the entrees, I appreciate them all. The burnt ends fried rice was a decent cross between Asian and southern cooking right down the middle, and the mac and cheese is very generous with plenty of customization. If you come for brunch on the weekends, the donuts have a great sugary bite and the pancakes are very hearty (with bacon cooked in too!).  I've had Nitros, stouts, and porters here, but you'll find plenty of IPAs and ales too. I was pretty happy with everything I got, and it's a good range from local breweries to in house. Selection can change in as little as a week too, which I like.  I've been to similar joints like OHSO, Fate, and Four Peaks, but I definitely believe SBC is leading the pack in terms of food. No doubt I'll be back.

Really guys? "High prices", "mediocre boba", "not milk tea"? You are free to criticize as you feel, but please show me any alternatives to the boba scene in Scottsdale. Because right now I see jack.  Scottsdale is long past due a dedicated boba tea joint, and setting up in Fashion Square is not a bad venue. Next to a soon-to-be Lush and Brookstone, BTC is an easily central location in the mall.  The menu, ignoring the fancy names, is standard - fruit teas, milk teas, blended drinks and more. The toppings basically came down to popping boba, boba, and jelly. I opted for Southern Belle with fizz and orange popping. I couldn't really detect the fizz, but it was a pleasant sweet peach tea with popping boba filled with that concentrated orange syrup.  Is price a concern? Not at all - you're paying the same to less than a dollar more for the junk you can get at Starbucks. Even coming from areas with way higher markups than Scottsdale, my friends and I all agreed the drinks more than met the bar for decent pearls and tea.  Are there other places in the Phoenix area with better milk tea? Absolutely, but I am NOT driving an extra 10-20 miles south to save 50 cents or drink marginally better tea. Boba Tea Company will pave the way for more milk tea/boba competition in Scottsdale, and I hope they're here to stay.
