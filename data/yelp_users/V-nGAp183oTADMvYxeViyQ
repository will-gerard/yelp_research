Well Im gonna be fair and only share my experiences with the TRUTH!  I use to go every wed night after work with co-workers when they had 25 cent watered down cheap drinks.. which was fine, im not much a beer drinker so i suffered a little.  anyways the girls who were at the bars seemed to be acting to busy to attend or got a lil pissy if we only tipped a dollar for a brew. :-/    Also MANY MANY times I had arguements with the front door bounce, who seemed to be a new guy every dam week.  well they would ask me to "Bend" my hat! And of course i gave em a smart remark,  I would reply " Bend it like a taco" !  Many times i would just suck it up and bend it a little bit to satisfy Lurch at the front gate, than of course fix it once inside, besides he was never gonna see me again.  Than at times they would say that my pants are too baggy!  for one i dont wear jeans EVER and i only wear dress clothes, so I replied saying "Well im fat"  they claimed they were to baggy, so yea a few times i went and just changed my shirt and returned with the same F*in pants and walke right in.  LoL  Also when i would argue about my pants or hat, there would be people and i dont mean to pull the race card but  Anglo's would be there with those ripped up Dback hats you buy that are pre-washed and pre-shitty , tore up and they were Ok with that?!?!?  WTF  or guys would come in with shorts and filp flops and They walked ritght in!!! WTF .   so basically I felt that i was being judged for my looks,  Granted Im mexican, It doesnt mean im in a gang, SERIOUSLY!!!?!?!  So after MANY TIMES of argueing over my clothes, hats, and even my kangol hat wasnt allowed in, and my Kangols are classy and pricey,  but NOPE NOT ALLOWED AT THE TIME!!!  Well after many times of calling up Corporate office in TX and letting them know how i was being treated, it seemed they loosened up a little I Guess,   I did go about 2 months ago , and I went in with my Kangol and to my surprise they let me in, wow!  And a few guys in there had there hats,  so it does pay off to get people attention, it does pay off to stand up for yourself, especially if your gonna spend money week after week , months after months..     I mean a hat/Kangol/Fedora, baggy pants doesnt mean your in a gang. that just F*kin rediculous!!     I only went because a friend invited me and offered to pay for everything, other than that I havent had a reason to go throw away my money there..  after all you want to feel like your welcomed, NOT OUTCASTED.     I NEVER WEAR JEANS, I DONT WEAR GANG CLOTHING, AND I DONT CAUSE TROUBLE,   SO IF YOU GO, I SUGGEST BRING AN EXTRA PAIR OF CLOTHING IN THE CAR WITH YOU, CAUSE WHO KNOWS WHAT KIND OF ATTITUDE AWAITS YOU AT THE DOOR  :-/   "just saying"

WoW I cannot believe what just seen, heard & been through. Tonight at 8pm2/16/16  I purchased 3lbs of Marinated chicken thighs at the Deli inside of food city. And when I brought it home the chicken looked different. The fat on the chicken seemed dry though it was wet, and certain areas were red and or dark. Since I was cooking in low light I wasn't sure if I was seeing things or in fact the chicken was indeed different in color. As I was cooking the first batch & cutting the second batch of chicken I can tell something wasn't right. It didn't smell good, it was very pungent and I immediately knew something was wrong. As I inspected the uncooked chicken that I have yet started to cook under the light more closely I could see grey in the chicken and some parts of it looked saggy and just Not fresh. I stopped cooking and dumped out all the chicken. I then drove right away to the store with receipt in hand in less then an hour time of buying it. I came up to the manager Alex and proceeded to tell him of this sickening problem. He then just stood there and said 'well I'm Sorry, what would you like for me to do.' I told him I want my money back and said I'm not going to buy any food from the store. He then said 'we've been telling the manager about it & getting on his ass, but they haven't done anything' he also said 'we get it from the distribution center' and he pointed towards the west direction as if I'm supposed to do something about it. He really didn't know what to say, but it's quite obvious he knew about it all along and didn't do the right thing as a manager and confront his superior. In my mind I was outraged because this could have gotten me sick or worse die! I was just going to cook it in the oven and probably not have even known about the discolored chicken if I didn't handle it or inspect it properly. This has happened to me before at this store. The first time I purchased it, it was once again the discounted chicken at the deli and took it to a BBQ with some friends. And luckily for us we didn't eat because upon inspection in the daylight that chicken was grey and just didn't look fresh and we dumped it. I was too far away to drive back and decided to go elsewhere and purchase cooked chicken instead. I'm speaking up for ALL the people who are too afraid to do something about it. Because I know I'm not the only one today who purchased this terrible chicken. This site Yelp gives us an avenue to speak our minds we need to use it to let other consumers know. I want to help save lives and not destroy them. So please check and double check your foods. I only shop here because it's close & convenient and usually the fruits, vegetables are beat and undesirable. But haven't yet complained. But as of tonight I'm done with this store and no longer eating meat anymore. My stomach is turning right now as I type this because I can still smell the stench of rotten cooked chicken in my kitchen. So Stand up people and let it be known how you feel about your local food city store, you don't have to put up with this!!  I'll be patiently awaiting on corporate to reply and I WILL follow up.

I went to Gordon Biersch Brewery after Octoberfest 2013, and needless to say I was already buzzin and wanted to have some good food, because well Octoberfest failed to provide.  Anywho , as we strolled down Mill Ave my friend recommended Gordon Biersch Brewery, and I said "what the heck why not" It was going to be a new experience for me. Well as we walked up the 3 flights of stairs I was very impressed with such a nice place. It was clean, we sat outside on the 2nd floor overlooking Mill Ave and it was such a nice view.  We had 2 delicious "Hefeweizen" beers and they were absolutely wonderful, fresh, yummy with a hint of Banana as the aftertaste, It was liquid heaven indeed.   My friend and I both had the Marzen Burger with garlic fries and it was good.  The server was great, gave us a lot of attention and served us with a smile. All in all it was a fun experience.   We had purchased some candles at octoberfest and we had these tiny bags to hold our stuff in, and somehow accidentally left our bags on the table after we had paid for our food.  We simply walked out and left it behind.  Later that evening, just before Gordon Biersch Brewery had closed we realized that we didn't have our stuff with us. I immediately called them at 11pm and asked if we had left our bags there, and they quickly said yes, the Gentleman I spoke with was "Mike"   So the next day I took off work early, invited my buddy to tag along and have another round of Hefeweizen's in the afternoon and this time we took the elevator rather than walk up the flight of stairs, and the elevator takes right into the dining area, very classy.  So once again I took the patio, shared a few Hefenweizen's and was treated good. Thanks again Mike for holding onto my candles and not letting anyone rip me off.  Such a class act, I will definitely be back and bring along my Dad to give him a taste of a new beer and EXCELLENT SERVICE!

Ive been here many many times, and this is my first review.  Ive always had a wonderfull time at Christie's and of course i neve want to leave.   As you walk in, you are greeted and the staff is great and professional. The greeter than directs you to a table of your choice and recommends women at times. The women there are HOT and attentative.  Everytime ive gone girls come up and ask nicely for a dance, even if I refused due to the fact that i havent chosen my "Hottie" yet, they are cool with it and leave with a smile.  There are many diverse women working there from you sweet Asian babydoll, to your Spicy Latinas, and Blonde Bombshells.  So you wont be dissapointed.  I love the fact that its dark, clean, and well ventilated.    The stage is big and beautiful,  there is no stipper pole and I like that.  To me that makes the girls there give YOU the attention you deserve, and not just ignore you by hugging the pole all night.    The girls crawl, lay down, and come directly to you if your sitting in front of the stage.  One time i took my dad, and this Dancer came up to him, layed her head on his lap, than did a flip over to where her legs landed on his shoulders and The Beaver met his face Eye to Eye LoL,  it was great to see the O'l man have a great time.  Till this day he brags to his friends how wonderfull Christies at the girls/staff treated us that evening.    Its defenitely a Classy Place and would HIGHLY recommend it those that enjoy a Gentlemans club and there sexy SEXY Dancers.   5 stars in my book.

Baseline sports bar, well its a nice bar with a huge screen to view sports and events.  Lately it has become a biker hangout but with class.  They have lots of cool events going on during the weekends like bike stunts, girls wrestling in a pool of noodles (whoo hoooo!) and Ive witnessed a few MMA matches going on outside with a cage set up.  Overall i think its a cool place. I havent had the chance to try alot on the menu. and ive only had a few pitchers of beer..    I may be back to try it out again.  I had the chance to go out again on Tuesday nights but just now had the chance to write a review.  WOW , free dinner and good food , plus a showing of Sons of Anarchy, whoa you cannot beat that with a stick.  The cook/chef comes out and announces his dishes, and boy every time ive gone its been Delicious and they have introduced my pallet to new foods. many are simple dishes made with a twist of Fabulous!  The bar itself is clean, full of cool people and again during the weekends its get loud , crazy and fun.  I dont drink anymore, but boy can I eat!  This place is definitely keeping up with being "The best bar in Tempe" and Im glad I keep going back.  The staff is great and any time my Dad comes in from California he always says, lets go to The Baseline Sports bar.  without a doubt he knows a good place once he recieves great customer service along with good food and beer.  Cheers.

FAIL!!!  So I take my good friend out for some fun on Mill Ave on a Monday night , so I always swing by my favorite spot Mill Cue Club.  As the night is ending she is out on the patio smoking a cigarette and she is feeling the vibe of a song playing outside next door at Zuma's, anyways, I said well lets go take a peek, ( Ive only been in this place once and only on the patio to share a drink with a friend..)    So as we proceed I noticed that Zuma's Bouncer is chumming it up with Mill Cue Club's bouncer and talking about who knows what,  as we walk litterally 5 feet over to Zuma's line to get in the EMPTY bar, the bouncer comes up and says 'Can I help you'  I proceed to pull out my I.D. and he says under his breath ' uhh your pants are too baggy"  I replied saying Excuse me'?  He says "your clothes are too baggy", I laugh and say , "dude im Fat !"  (plus i was wearing shorts not pants)  I look over and see maybe 4 people in the bar including the 2 girls outside smoking up their cancer sticks.  And Im thinking to myself, I just spent $40 bucks at Mill Cue Club because I had an awesome time,  and we all know when we are buzzing we tend to spend MORE MONEY!  SO NOW IM OFFENDED, I tell the Bouncer, "The only reason im wearing shorts is because its Hot ass hell out here and Im usually wearing a dress shirt and tie daily!  people this a freakin bar for goodness sakes, a hole in the wall,  its no Bistro, Its no classy spot, and you can honestly smell a stench coming from the place, weather its the bleachy pissy smell,  or stank coming off the BAD SERVICE!!   KISS MY BROWN ASS ZUMA, YOU WONT GET A PENNY NOR A GOOD WORD OUT OF ME..     Keep it classy and go next door to Mill cue club,  its nice inside, great service, smoking hot staff and cheap good drinks..     Im so glad there is an avenue that us customers can share our thought and opinions as well as our experiences..      DONT SUPPORT ZUMA!!!!    NO BUENO!!!!

WoW lots of negative reviews about this place.. well its been 2yrs ago since I've been here. Don't recall it being Ghetto, but than again People are what make estblishments ghetto. I'm going there tonight cause I was invited for a B-day party.. we got a cabana and a bottle, Sooo Ill post the results the following day! 'Keepin my fingers crossed' LoL  ** UPDATE**  Well I have to admit i was expected to see these horrible stories that I have read from previous reviews, and I have to say that I was very impressed with the new set up that Hurricane bay has. My friend rented out a cabana there and it was nice, the waitress was SMOKING HOT and very nice, very playfull and gave us lots of attention. I wouldnt mind going again if it wasnt so far from me. The Karaoke room was small, but the people who sang were good and lots of interaction with those who sang. everyone seemed to be  having fun. So i have to give this another star and 1-up my rating, i was very impressed and had lots of fun with my date for the evening..    We all have to experience it first before we can just follow along with any "bad/negative' reviews..     I hope this helps, if your in the area check it out

I would reccomend this place to someone who just wants a relaxed sports bar.  most of the time ive gone its not too packed.    4**** stars!

Ive always liked TMP , its fun , open and lots to choose from.  you got your clothing stores, so lots of shopping. You can also stop by and have some lunch/dinner and even a few cocktails along the way.  I think its great for the family and also a good time for a first date.   One evening I went to dave and busters and had a blast, had a few drinks and food. than moved on next door to the San Felipe bar which is fun and open.  nice patio and cool people.  overall a great experience everytime I go.  Defenitely check out this place and support it.

WoW talk about great customer service.  I work with in the customer service field and Dan is definitely the MAN! He greeted me before I took my 2nd step into the front door. It was an early morning, so only 1 person in the chair and Dan took me right away. He opened up right away, we talked about Sturgis, talked about Softball.  I hardly go to the Barber shop because my hair is easy to cut. But this time around I needed Help!  I told Dan exactly what I wanted and he made suggestions too.  And the results are better than I've ever had and cheaper than most Other barber shops that I've been too.  I found my new Barber Shop and I praise him well.  He's a Humble Gentleman, Smiled the whole time he was there & greeted all the customers that walked in immediately. Made me feel at ease. I definitely recommend this place. Im a Happy Customer and believe me I don't get impressed that easy.  Thanks Dan, see you again.  :)

Lucky Strike!   This place is Deliciously Classy. I took my sweety there for our first date. It was a Sunday just after the George Lopez "Dream out Loud" tour at the Comerica Theatre.  And as soon as we walked in we were in awe.  Its dark, sexy, and a lot going on.  There were about a dozen bowling lanes, pool tables, and a nice lounge area so you can sit watch your date bowl.  We arrived just before a company gathering had arrived and we were mistaken as being part of the group. So they were very happy to see us come in, and gave us the Royal treatment.   When they finally realized we were not part of the party, they asked politely to ask us to move because it was rented.    Nicole was very nice to us, and didn't charge due to the fact that it was a mix up and I didn't understand that it was rented for another party.  All in all it was a great experience. We had a fun time , even though it was cut short.  And I will definitely be back to play and order and try out the food.    Ive noticed people complain about the price of bowling, honestly it's a fair price, because it includes the ambiance as well and the music and good vibe this place gets.  The atmosphere of an environment is very classy and those are the types of places Id like to continue taking my date and or a group of people that Id like to impress. So 5 stars for great service, great time, and nice decor AND its in the downtown Phoenix scene, theres so much to do there, and now theres bowling!!!  NICE!!  Nicole provided AWESOME customer service!!  Great Job!

Great restaurant, it was clean, spacious and had great decor.  Ive eaten at a few buffets, and this has to be the cleanest one ive been to.  Food was good, hot and fresh. Lunch was around $10 plus drink.  Defenitely a buffet to visit and enjoy with the family.   Mon - Fri before 4pm around $10 Sat - Sun Dinner after 4pm, around $13
