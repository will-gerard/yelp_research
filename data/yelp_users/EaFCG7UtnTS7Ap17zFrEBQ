Having just completed the landscaping for a new home, I knew I wanted to compliment it with outdoor lighting. My previous homes had big box store path lighting and they would always fail. They would break, made cheaply, etc. This time I wanted to do it right.  I had several bids from various companies but Todd's was the most understandable. He carefully explained his warranties, the types of bulbs he uses (and I learned not all bulbs are created equal!!), etc. he's a lighting artist and came up with the perfect plan. Within a week of our meeting, my yard was finished.  His installation was simple and left the grounds just as he found them. You'd never know he dug a trench around the perimeter.  The quality of his fixtures are amazing -these are the kind of lights you'd see at fine estate homes-and he's very reasonably priced! The end result is like fine jewelry on a ball gown!  Couldn't be happier and eager to recommend him to anyone!

Couldn't be more pleased...discovered a huge bee swarm in my front tree...called in the early evening and the phone was immediately answered with a promise he'd remove the swarm first thing in the morning. I woke up early and he had already taken care of it and cleaned up thoroughly. Highly recommend this group!

Such fun...love the historic charm, trendy cocktails and energetic vibe...a must if you're looking for a true downtown Urban establishment! Gotta try the Vesper martini!

Second time trying it and still not a fan. Food is tasteless, service slow. Ordered the rib eye-how can you screw that up? They did though. Maybe the coffee bar is better? Definitely not a dinner spot. Great atmosphere though.
