I would send friends here and will come back soon enough. In fact I would drive out of my way to come here for their pho broth. Homemade beef broth with no bouillon!!! First time having shrimp in my Pho. It's not fancy decor, but who needs fancy when you have delicious!

I got the chicken pho with broccoli and spring rolls to go on a hungover Sunday night. I was a bit scared as the ratings for pho didn't seem that great and pho to go is always a let down. But it was one of the desperation things.   I was extremely pleasantly surprised. It was large enough for me to eat two meals from so that was nice. The flavor was delicious. The only complaint would be no jalape√±os, but I had a fresh one at home so it worked out.   The receptionist, Paloma, was very nice and helpful while I waited. She deserves a raise for her hard work!

Fun place to go drink beer. They have many options and there is more to do than sit at the bar.

I don't know if I would ever eat here regularly, but it's definitely worth it at least once. The setting of this place is pretty cool because you are under ground.   The prices were a little hefty for the quality, but you're probably paying for the atmosphere.   The service we had was exceptional.

The food quality is great and they have many Italian options but the prices are a little steep. The dining area is small so you would not want to take a group here, but they do have options for some ingredients you would not find and other large grocery stores.

I had their fake turkey special wrap today and it was awesome. Employees have always been nice, friendly and helpful. Definitely making more returns and recommending to others.   For a guy that loves meat, I love this vegetarian style food stop.

If you're looking for some good heavy Italian food then this is the place to go. The food is all pretty darn delicious, there is generally a line to wait and the service is good.   The pizza is dense and delicious. The pasta is plentiful. This is good old American style Italian so you will definitely go home full. Maybe too full.

The breakfast buzz is a great option to start your day, but it is the only thing I have ever ordered so I don't know how accurate my rating would be for the overall menu. The other stuff looks delicious though but parking is a pain in the butt.

This place is very convenient for me to ride my mtn bike to from my home. The Trails are great for beginner as the elevation climbs are short. There is a lot of loose rocks on the single track so it can get pretty treacherous.   It has beautiful views when you climb to the top of downtown Phoenix. It takes 10 minutes to get to the top if you hike up from the parking on McDowell.

Just moved here from Newport Beach and was wondering if I could find good Pho here because SoCal has some of the best. Well Jimmy (owner) is from Huntington Beach and he brought great Pho to Az. Thank you Jimmy, it was delicious!

The setup of this company's order process always frustrates me a little. You're in line waiting but people are moving forward in front of you because they are done ordering at their particular station. It's just a cluster in my opinion.   The food is pretty average for what you get. On this visit it took more than 15 minutes to get my noodle bowl which is much too long for a quick lunch spot. Most of the time the service is very fast.   I will probably return to one of their locations at some point but I would never go out of my way to stop here.

I like this place a lot but I've only been here twice. The food was great and the bartenders know how to poor a proper cocktail. I need to go back more often, but this place is high on my recommendation list for a good place to go.

This is my favorite place to eat and I love the concept. Very healthy and light food. They are a great spot for all 3 meals. However, I think they are best with their breakfast foods.   The juices are delicious and refreshing.   I will continue to return many times and recommend this to everyone.

Went here last night for the first time. The ambiance is vibrant, fun, energetic, and business hip.   I never thought you could beat the Mastro's bone-in filet but Steak 44 definitely did.   The wine list is great with some mighty fine options and the oysters were a great way to start the meal.   I will be back, but make sure you make a reservation!

The leasing office staff is awesome. And so are the maintenance crew. The gym is above adequate for the rent price is kept smelling clean!  The surrounding neighborhood is pretty HOOD and the garage door is always broken allowing them to enter your "secure" community at will. They fix the doors but they always break in less than a month. I've talked to several people with missing bicycles so put yours in your apartment.   If you stay for your entire lease the policy to go month to month afterwards might be considered grand larceny in some states.   The hot tub makes an annoying high pitch winding noise that reminds me of the feeling your ears experience when nails scratch a chalkboard.  The grills in the common areas are great to use. The pool is nice and the hot tub well it's a hot tub in a public place so you can imagine it's after hour uses. Living with your windows facing the pool and common area is loud because of all the noise bouncing off the walls. Select a place facing the mountains for the best views.   A lot of the pet owners are lazy shit heads who don't care to pick up their dogs shit. The maintenance staff is too busy to stay on top of cleaning it up.

Now this a proper coffee spot in Chandler. If you appreciate a REAL coffee drink made with the best beans. I had the Cubano and my barista was awesome. The price was affordable and you don't have to deal with all of the people waiting for overly sweetened foofoo coffee drinks you get at Starbucks! #whereubean

Originally I was skeptical of this place because of the exterior appearance. However, I should not have judged this book by its cover.   The service was exceptional. The sushi was fresh and delicious. The decor inside was very modern and clean.   The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is because I have not had enough time to try more on the menu or let the chefs create their own off the menu plates.   I will definitely return here.

This is my favorite coffee spot so far in Scottsdale. The service is always top notch. The coffee is delicious and they will get creative if you don't see something on the menu you would like. The interior design and decoration is really cool and hip. A great place to sit and talk with friends over a coffee or a beer.

I did not particularly enjoy the food after being here 3 times. Maybe I'm not cut out for English pub food. Finding a healthy option was tough and everything is heavy.  The service was good by the bartender the first time on a weeknight but the one time I went on a Saturday night the service was remarkably bad. We had to constantly ask for our servers attention. Maybe that is another British customary thing I'm not a fan of or maybe it was just an off night.   Very cool place though aesthetically.

This chipotle always seems to have issues with ingredients and employees who don't necessarily seem to care what they are doing. I go because it's close.

Culinary Dropout is a great place to get good food and be very social. This location is great for groups and has extra things to do because it is connected to The Yard so you can play ping pong, cornhole and shuffleboard.   Lindsay was our server last night and she was great. Customer service was on point and she has a sense of humor.   It's a little pricey but you're paying for the environment.

Very good fast food lunch spot. I stopped by on sales calls today. The pork meatball sandwich was very delicious and the lemon ginger tea was refreshing.   The prices are affordable and the design is very clean and modern feeling.   Two thumbs up

I'm a loyal Peixoto customer and drive out of my way to come back here. I use their espresso blend in my machine at home.   Keep up the great work, service and coffee drinks. I can't wait to keep coming back!
