I'm not very familiar with other Japanese restaurants in Chandler, but this one was a great find. You'll get the authentic Japanese feeling when you walk in and you're greeted in Japanese by a hosted who will seat you(of course you can sit at the bar or at a table). The decor and ambiance of the restaurant sets off the mood just right for a casual date night.  The service was excellent and the food came out fairly fast for how busy they were. Couldn't remember what we had ordered but it was good. Would dine again in the near future.

Stopped in after a long day of shopping and moving with a few friends. The overall cleanliness of the establishment was good. The gentlemen who took our order was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered a Red Chili burro plate - came with rice and side of beans - Lets just say I was very disappointed . The Rice was dry and bland - the Red Chili burro had no flavor at all, to top it off they wanted to charge you 25 cent for a refills! It's bad enough the fountain drinks were two or more dollars! tisk tisk.

Ah!!!!!! Another great restaurant in old town Scottsdale. With its modern look and lighting this place is an awesome place to bring a date.    The Girlfriend and I came here for our monthly date night last weekend, after finding this deal on Groupon.  We were seated outside on the patio due to the air conditioner being down.  BOY WAS IT HOT, holy hell - good thing they had the misters out.  Not really a picky eater, I would pretty much devour anything that's enable. We ordered the Tuscan pizza, a pitcher of white sangria for her and a glass of beer for me. Not much of a sangria drinker either, the lucky GF had the whole pitcher to herself! (Talk about alcoholic)^_^  Our thin crust Tuscan pizza was amazing! Full of flavor in every single bite.  Our server was a little slow getting to us, but it was a really busy night.  All and all this place is awesome, and I really enjoyed our visit. Will definitely be back soon. ^_^ KCYE

This will be my 3rd Caesars affiliated resort I've visited, out of the 3; Linq, flamingo, Pairs, this by fare trumps them all. From the valet to guest service to housekeeping, everyone was just so friendly and attentive.  We got a nice room, fixed with 2 queen beds which fit 4 big (muscly) guys comfortably overlooking the high roller ferris wheel! The room was VERY clean, just wish they had a keurig coffee machines vs the crappy pos coffee maker they had.   My only complaint about the resort was the floor table manager. He wasn't in a good mood and seems like he was hating life. He made a few sarcastic comments about how loud I was being several of time. Come on man, this is Vegas, the city that NEVER sleeps. But Johnny, the bartender from the main bar made up for the lack of customer service the manger didn't have. He was very friendly and helpful, we even shared a few comments about girls walking by! ^_^   All and all I love this resort and would stay here again, gambling? I'll just stick to the Linqs hotel. Over there I won't be judged or criticize for trying to have a good time.       KCYE Don

Never been to Philadelphia nor have I ever been to a whole lot of places that sells cheesesteak sandwiches. But this place reminds me of a place in Tucson called Frankies South Philadelphia Cheesesteak.    From my understanding this place used to be located on 5th Ave which they've relocated to Craftsman Ct in Old Town Scottsdale. The new location has three times the space than the original one. Still open 24 hours a day, it's probably the only place you can get a Philly cheesesteak at 3 am.  The GF had bought a Groupon to this place awhile back and finally decided to take me here (feel so lucky). I ordered a regular 9 inch Cheese-steak with whiz cheese and a side of fresh cut fries (oh if you check in here, you'll get a free basket of fries with your order). Within 5 minutes or so our order arrived - and just as fast as the food came out it was gone!  The bread was nice and soft and the steak was full of favor!   This place is awesome! The only thing that bugged me was trying to find a parking space. Holly hell I think we were driving around for hours! Ok Ok maybe not hours but it sure seems like it (hungry status).   Love this place and will hopefully be back soon.  KCYE

The Girlfriend has been raving about this place for some time now, and seeing that we were in the area - why not stop in for lunch. The price wasn't too bad, you'll be looking to spend between 5 - 15 bucks a plate/dish. I went ahead and ordered the "Hawaiian BBQ mix" , pretty much gave me a taste of everything besides the sea food. The meats were jammed pack with flavor and a one of a kind taste. Would come again. =D

After a very long hot day at the art and wine festival on Mill Avenue, the GF and I decided to try a new joint (built up a pretty good appetite). Once again yelp came to the rescue. After reading many reviews about this place I was very hesitant to dine here. Seeing that we were already at the location and didn't feel like going anywhere else, we decided to get our food fix here. (Boy did I pay for that decision!).  The restaurant itself is awesome, had the right lighting, the background music was loud enough to hear but low enough to hear each other talk, and it's an open bar.   After being seated, we were greeted by a very rude waitress (Britni) who took our drink order. Five or so minutes later she came back with our waters and took our order. We ordered the California club pizza and also a peach tea. Fifteen minutes rolls by and no sign of our waitress, our glasses of water were empty, haven't got the peach tea yet (starting to get annoyed). The food runner brought out our "eye candy" pizza, Man - O - Man it looked delicious. Keep in mind we still haven't got the peach tea yet, with our waitress nowhere to be found I waved down another waitress, who kindly stopped and asked if we needed anything.  Ask her if she could get us a side of ranch and our peach tea we ordered 20 or so minutes ago. She apologized and said she'll be right out with it. Soon after she had left "OUR" waitress (Britni) shows up and ask if we needed anything. In my mind I was thinking (OMG are you for reals! Where the hell have you been!). Asked her about our peach tea and asked her for a refill on my water.   She reply's back "Oh, I totally forgot about the peach tea".  No apology what so ever. The peach tea FINALLY came out after we were done with our pizza.To top it off she charged us for the troubled peach tea.  Aside from the horrible waitress the pizza was awesome and full of flavor.   P.S. If you hate your job that much, please do us all a favor and quit. Go find something else to do with your life.

I feel like the stick is always talking me into stopping by this place - wait it might be my gambling addiction!   Whatever the case may be this is by far one of the best hotel and casino I've been to all over Arizona. Located on the east side of the 101-N This Four-Diamond Scottsdale resort attracts people with there immaculate beauty and service.  You can savor the flavors and take in the panoramic views from the Orange sky restaurant which is located on the 15th floor. Not sure about the weekdays but on the weekends they have a live Jazz band that plays.  They have over 240,000 square feet of casino games - from; slot machines, poker, table games and keno. You can catch me on the electronic roulette table - Some reason i tent to triple my money.  Tip: If you don't want to pay the high prices for a cocktail - Head down to the lower level of the casino and buy your drinks! They have $5.00 strong margaritas!   Note: Great place to escape for a StayCation!  KCYE

New Revolving sushi in town and a Groupon for it. . . . SOLD! After buying this Groupon deal online we came here last night for dinner. The decor and style of the restaurant was very hip and colorful. The layout of the establishment was horrible. If you were sitting in the inner bar and wanted to use the restroom. You had to walk all the way around and over, Just to get to it.   The service was awesome; friendly and helpful. Thank you, Carlos.    The food: Let's just say I enjoyed the coconut shrimp and fried rice more than the sushi. The sushi was very SMALL portioned and bland - I've been to many revolving sushi establishments around town and never seen/had such a small amount of sushi on a plate for the same price.  PS if it hadn't been for the great service, this place would have gotten a one star.
