I had a wonderful experience and excellent customer service. Over the last couple of days, I have been texting Big Mike about what color, kind of car, and payment I wanted. He found my next red Camry, completed most of the paperwork prior to my arrival, gave us free lunch and made everything really painless. Most people dread the car buying experience but there is no reason to at Big Two with Big Mike!

Yelp did not fail me on this one. BYOB with no corkage fee and a Safeway around the corner. A cute little place with a lot of great old photos of Chicago. The dining area is very small, but has character. They have Chicago style pizza and Vienna dogs with celery salt- a must for a real Chicago dog. The pizza had their own sausage with a lovely fennel seed taste. The sauce was perfect. Not too sweet and not too salty. The staff was so helpful and friendly and one of the partial owners even came out and visited with the guests. We shared and heard a lot of Chicago stories while dining. The price was very reasonable and perfect for the amount of food. I like being able to see into the kitchen and watching the food handling and preparation. The next time I am in the area, I will absolutely visit again and bring my own favorite wine!

This place has a fun, funky vibe. The decor is so awesome with lots of really great sayings on the walls that involve chickens or eggs. I love the TVs and music. The menu is very diverse and offers vegan options so everyone can get just what they want. The staff was very friendly and all of them had HUGE smiles. My husband and I both got the gringo burrito. He twisted his up with turkey sausage. I have to say mine was good.  I asked for extra cheese, but my husband did not. He could find no cheese but that is standard on the gringo. He felt it was kind of bland, but I had to remind him that he did get the gringo. The side of fruit was very good as were the crispy hash browns.

So peaceful. Beautiful decor and calming environment. Felisha had me so relaxed that I was asleep during my facial. I came in because of a gift card from my son and his girlfriend, but I will be back! Very reasonably priced. The products used had a lovely fragrance and I have very sensitive skin, but had no problems with their line. My skin is glowing! Thanks for the treat!

This is one of my favorite places of all times. When Rigatony's moved from Arizona Avenue, my husband and I thought we would go less. It was further away from our home and we were scared it would lose the charm and good food. It has been quite the opposite. We visit our favorite server Frankie at least once a week...and sometimes twice. We have been known to even show up three times a week, but that borders on addiction, so I hate to admit that. I would love to eat pasta three times a week, but cannot. We will order grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and the house salad. I will give credit to my best friend Robin who recommended that healthy alternative with the ability to still get our "fix". We have ordered party packages for gatherings at our house more times than I can count. Every dish I have ever had is incredible. Out of town guests??? We always bring them here. We take credit for creating a few addicts that insist on a visit when they are in town. Frankie sees us and asks if we are getting the usual and if we aren't then she can usually guess what the alternative is. CRAZY GREAT service. We love Christian who was once upon a time was "only"  behind the bar, but has taken on some managerial duties. The wine dinners are SO awesome and creative. Mike is always there to ensure our experience is awesome every time. Devoted diner cards have earned all kinds of discounts. They recognize us when we walk in, ask about our grand kids and are truly a family restaurant. Who could ask for more?

I have never been treated so poorly in my life. We sat at the table for 20 Minutes before acknowledged. Finally got to order happy hour drinks. Had to almost BEG to get service. My food was horrible. My steak was well when I asked for medium. Other people in the party got meatloaf and that was excellent. A delicious warm butter cake was provided by the chef to compensate for my food. I asked for water and finally got a glass, but no one else at the table did.  I had to ask three times for wine and water and everything was very slow. The last time I asked for water, the waitress went to the back bar and was flipping out because the table asked for something after they closed. We were with people who have visited this club almost weekly for months. I will never come back!!!! Certainly not worth the drive, even with the view! Lisa was the most rude server one could have.

The pizza was delicious and some of our friends has various sandwiches which they raved about. One friend had gluten free pizza and she was not a fan. We had a dog with us but he was not allowed inside the fence of the outside patio, which I thought odd. The service started out great, but then we ran out of drinks and had to wait a bit to receive refills and our checks. The food took quite awhile, but definitely worth the wait. Delicious!!!!!  They also have Coca Cola products which made my husband very happy!

So excited that there will be a new place to go in the Lakes area. Have eaten here twice and everything we tried was amazing. My daughter loves the fries, so have even gotten them to go to take to her. I cannot wait to see what the inside looks like when complete. With support from the community, I think this will be a great "go to" place for years to come.

I have been talking with The Watershed's management for a few months now. I have seen the building in every phase of renovation. Unfortunately, I was helping to plan a Celebration of Life for a dear friend with terminal brain cancer and the staff was aware I could be calling them at any time to set a date.  Tuesday morning, my friend passed away and I knew that we would need the inside as well as the outside. I have never seen a more dedicated group of people jump in to work night and day so the inside was as close to perfect as they could get it. I spent the last several days at The Watershed, setting up special items and placing candles and flowers. I had every person that I encountered go above and beyond to help me. The celebration occurred on Friday and things could not have been more perfect. The food, atmosphere, drinks, staff, and facility were just exactly what my friend would have wanted. I will be taking everyone I know to this restaurant. If I need to plan another event, I will be calling them. I hope the community gets behind this place and supports it as they perfect their service, food, and business.

Nicely decorated and staff so friendly. Food very tasty! Great neighborhood location for the Islands neighbors. The bocce ball court is an added bonus that will be enjoyed by our friends for a long time.
