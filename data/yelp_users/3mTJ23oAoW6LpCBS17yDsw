I used to live on the other side of the street from this gym and every time I'm back in AZ I only train here. Machines and equipment are clean, there are familiar faces and One Stop Nutrition is next door.   I was able to keep my membership here with a $10 a month fee. I appreciated their wanting to work with me on this.   The regular goers are cool, non meat market or harassing folk. Women can train here and feel empowered without being gawked at or objectified.   Cool place to train.

I will always remember this place as the sight of the worst meal I ever had. I tipped 25% just so I wouldn't feel bad as I'm writing this.   Service was unsatisfactory. We were not offered a hello, a place to sit or even acknowledged for that matter.  When we finished our meal I was craving mochi but was instead brought the check by the other waitress.   The meal was a shitty bowl of seafood udon with overlooked, sparse muscles and inedible mixes of shrimp and octopus (both were overcooked and rubbery as well). I also had the worst spider roll to date.   Do not eat here if you are seeking good, fresh and clean eating environment.   Eat here if you want to punish yourself.

Todd was our waiter and definitively stood out above any aspect of our dining experience. Knowledgable, warm, friendly and quick to recommend from his vast knowledge of Boccas menu.   Garlic fries were the big deal meal treat of the night. Crispy outside and soft, non oily core. Very good  flavor, a bit robust but I like my garlic strong.   Pizza was pretty good, a little thick on the bread but overall pizza size was perfect to split with another fellow pizza lover   Overall a fine dining experience!

Only the freshest ingredients sourced from local Arizona farms to the stretches of Yuma, AZ. Very clean and orderly. Not too stuffy on the options but a fair amount. Wraps and salads with over 30 ingredients to choose from.   Various coffee, cold drink options.   Clean tables, chairs and counters. Bathrooms were very sanitary and floors were swept and mopped.   Staff was helpful, courteous and fine examples of good hosts.   My only wish is to have a place like this walking distance from my house in Los Angeles.
