I like this airport for a lot of reasons   But one really obscure one popped up recently when looking at the airport map.  Holy cow, the map of the gates and grounds is the  same shape as an Inukshuk.  Really?  It's not a worthy story to tell why I recognize this, but if we all lived in the Arctic Circle, the inukshuk is the man-shaped stack of rocks that we would all be looking for during our trip.  Those sturdy bodies are built out there in the scarey white wilderness by travellers to safely guide those who come after them.  And that's what the Charlotte airport does.   I was also impressed that the gate call included, "First class passengers and all enlisted personnel in uniform."  Keepin' us safe.  Guiding us to the next stop. Thanks, Charlotte and all who pass through.

Because I was on first light standby, I got to the breakfast counter as soon as it opened.  I counted four employees, and two customers, and another couple of customers arriving before I left this splendid eatery.  The cashier took my order and my money, then told my order to the prep people who slumped only a couple of feet away from her.  I waited.  And waited.    The alleged biscuit on my breakfast sandwich was probably yesterday's version of a croissant,  Soggy, flat, gooey.  Yuk.  While I was examining this mess, the prep employee told the poor Eastern European guy who was struggling with English that "there ain't no bar-ree-toes wadja want?"  yikes.  Even repeating it wasn't going to help the visitor (or me) to understand that advice.  The visitor was a lot more nimble than I would have been in his position.  He glanced up at the menu board and defaulted to another combo number.  Doubt he even knew what would be handed to him. What I doubted even more was the situation. A cashier at the start of business doesn't know that there are menu items missing from the kitchen.  Then she continues to take money from arriving customers for the missing "Bar-ree-toes."    I just don't have much of an appetite for that kind of weirdness at any time of day.

Five star, times more stars.    I visited during the Spring bloom.  This is officially the next check on my bucket list for seeing Unbelievable Floral Displays of the Natural World.    Footpaths were wide and plant specimens were well marked and tended.  Outside, a triad of Chihuly glass greets visitors.  http://www.blurb.com/b/4224563-scottsdale-arizona-april-2013  I could have spent another day exploring, but time was short.  The Garden was rich with visting huming birds, lizards, and other footed friends.    At $18 PP, entry pricing is comparable to other horticultural sites around the country.  It certainly goes to the good cause of preserving and protecting regional flora.

I had a great time here in this post office converted to neighborhood restaurant.  Note to namers:  You could probably drop the Arcadio in the name because everything around is Aracdia this, Arcadia that.  Kind of like Florida where it is pelican or palm or sunshine whatever.  We get it.  Anyway, there was good,  live music somethere over there in the corner.  Servers were peppy and fun and informed,  The menu was largely small plates for small budgets and small appetites, which seem to fit in this hip, gentrifying neighborhood.  Organic and fresh all the way.  We had a choice of bruschetta and it was terrific.  Especially the fig and goat cheese with sauteed onion.  Decor is eclectic.  They kept the frame of the former federal post office, complete with delivery bay door framing, and put the required exposed ducts in the ceiling.  The wall next to where we sat at high topped tables was papered with a humorous, Brooklyn toile.   Parking is really limited, so expect to cruise the side streets for a space.

This is more about the rental car terminal than about Budget operations.  My daughter's experience while I waited for her to complete her Budget  reservation seemed fine, however.  PHX has solved the ugly step-child situation that car rental operations cause for most airports.  Cram the check-in desks into the farthest corner of baggage pickup?  Send rental car clients out into the weather, or into funky garages to get their car as well grease monkey attitudes?  Not at PHX.  There are air conditioned coaches dedicated to rental car customers that stop at each airline terminal.  Drivers will actually help you board as well as help to board unwieldly luggage.  PHX has an entire terminal dedicated to rental car agencies.  It's about five miles away from the international PHX, but worth the ride.  You can qeue in whichever agency's lines you choose.  Each rental agency has their own three walls.    After the endless paperwork, you exit the sparkling concourse, visit a booth in the contiguous garage, and walk to a parked car.  If you don't have the correct paperwork, and/or are unwilling to show ID aong with the docs, a weathered, uniformed clerk in another booth is authorized to throw the switch on reverse tire spikes in the exit lane.  That's rental car border protection at its finest..

Terminals seem to be metasticising here.  One lovely link after another.  The newspaper during my visit proudly announced that a Sky Train would soon start service from downtown Phoenix to the airport. Cool.    I watched a television monitor in one of the gate areas as it scrolled local news.  Egad.  Because of Spring, "Rattlesnakes coming out of hibernation.  Snake bite numbers increasing."  I wasn't so eager to rush down to baggage.  But when I did,  retrieval was speedy.    The American flights brought me into a concourse that offered a steep escalator to baggage.  The surrounding walls in that escalator passage were sandstone with striations like the desert outside.  Suspended above the moving stairs was a vintage prop plane.  Its cables came from a divine Crafstman, stylized skylight - assumedly referencing Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin that is one of Phoenix's attractions.  As for those snakes.  Never saw any.  No snakes on the plane.  No snakes in the airport.  I later asked a local who drove a shuttle about that scrolling news.  He just laughed and told me that it wasn't like the snakes were waking up and coming after people.  Fine.  I settled back and enjoyed the rare sajuaro cactii in the airport's xeriscaping, still glad it was all outside in the heat while I was inside a sealed car.

Chicago style pizza with thick crust & deep toppings. We also ordered spinach salad. It was very fresh. The creamy poppyseed dressing is a local fave.  Outdoor patio under a red awning lined with the ubiquitous misters is perfect for a casual, Friday night out.

This is a meet & greet place from the looks of the serious and not so serious conversations taking place at the tables.  Men in suits.  Or with marvelous tats.  Women in flowing Native American skirts.  Or Lulu togs.   Come as you are.  Or as you wanna be.  Breakfast is wonderful.  I liked the breakfast sandwich, stacked with a rich yellow egg, bacon, gruyere cheese, and wasabi mayo.  Coffee is dark French Press, and left in a an ergonomic, triangular pot at your table.  I think I left a dusty colored scarf with net and glitter running though it beneath the table.  If it's true that you leave something behind when you unconsciously hope to return, I'll make it back to Breakfast Club one day.

No appointment needed.  Brow wax $10.  Tips required in cash per sign saying "...from this day forward".  Small salon with attentive, pleasant staff.   Right in Old Town .

This would be five stars if I wasn't gnawed by no-seeums while seated inside near a window. But I love the wood fire smell from the parilla.  This re-purposed brick house is charming, despite the reluctance of the desert to really vacate the premises.  I had a delicious, dark green, tender poblano in white sauce.  It was filled with mixed white and dark meat chicken and queso.  Quak was chunked and distinctly spiced with lime on a too-tall bed of shredded lettuce.   Service is a little spacey, but definitely accommodating. Parking is really easy.

I saw these aliens on earth when the show first opened.  But years later, the updated production is as fresh and funny and entertaining as ever.  Loved it.

Meh.  Sports bar.  Worse, a sports bar chain.  The outdoor patio was more attracitve, even if was part of the mall's covered car park.  I don't tolerate the smell of stale beer.  That's what greeted me at the inside podium.  There's bar food on the menu, of course.  Fried next to more fried stuff.  Come here after work and throw down some beers.  That would be fun.

Bad weather happens.  So I was stranded overnight in Charlotte, NC.  The Help Desk (sic) provided a blue slip with an 800 number that was supposed to locate lodging.  Instead, the recorded message said,"...sold out."  As airline employees abandoned their passengers as midnight closed in, and the air terminal closed down, the inside temp of the pretty airport fell like a rock.  From now on I will leave the tropics with an anorak, "just in case."    Standby the next day began at 6AM, and didn't succeed in shuttling my tired self out of there until almost 4PM.  The podium employees practice with marbles in their mouth and go to work on the mike in the same style.  The Service (sic) counter personnel are not completely trained in either the computer system or general civility.  I really felt sorry for the US Air personnel who were also at the mercy of standby rules.  There were five pilots and three attendants in uniform vying for the same standby seats.    Once on the plane, I realized that the interior space sadists had been hard at work.  You have to practically walk sideways while a carryon bag barely fits in the aisle.  It's not just old timers who complain that flight experience just ain't what it used to be,   Useless Airways indeed.

Count on an urban adventure here.  It begins on arrival by pulling in under a covered entry which on closer examination, is the undercarriage of the pool on the level above. Complete with  portholes in the pool bottom that give a glimpse of swimmers to any stalkers who might linger as they are leaving a car below.  All parking is by valet. They are quick and reponsive  - especially for a guest calling from the room to have a car ready at curbside.  The lobby is a properly yet dimly lit cave of modern furnishings dominated by tables made of polished stone in their natural shapes.  A small boutique is here without sundries.  Unless you think that party dresses, pool jewelry, and men's swim trunks are usual hotel gift shop fare.  Don't expect razors or postcards or chotchky gifts.  Wall Street Journal, NY Times and the local papers are available gratis each morning for guests.   Rooms have an Asian influence with glass rather than rice paper shoji panels with backlights across the closet as well as the commode room.  "W" leads the industry with other luxury properties for using washable duvets instead of scarily unhealthful bedspreads. For energy efficiency and ambiance, windows will actually open.  But when they do, the air conditioning automatically shuts off.  We had a snafu in the small cell called a business center when we tried to use the Net to upload from an SD - the Net vendor charged three times instead of once and then froze access.  Once again, W management personally intervened to call the vendor for a chargeback and a promise of full session service.    Maid and room service were top of the line. After a misunderstanding, the manager sent two glasses,a bottle of wine, and two cookies to the room as apology.  Bright green apples and fruit infused ice water are offered every day at the check-in desk.  Staff is professional and cheerful  A great experience.

Wish we had tried this restaurant for dinner instead of dashing in for breakfast.  It is conveniently located and promoted within W Hotel.  However, we did...  Other hotel guests were here, but the breakfast was just awful.    Muffins laced with preservatives and sticky, like the ones you find at convenience stores.  Bacon stiff as a dead stiff.  Redneck toast - skinny, white, and tasteless.  Service was rushed and inattentive.  Except for the beautiful surroundings, this is a place that is unredeemable for American breakfast.

This was the best birthday gift!  I was indulged with a loooong sports massage.  The therapist had a great command of physiology and was able to trace the guarded muscles at my back.  Her work improved my recovery from a two-month old back injury, and gave wonderful relaxion too.  More spa.  I kicked the too-big slippers and entered a private steam chamber.  Mint gel was sprinkled on the floor and added menthol to the steaming heat.  The dressing room offered full products for reconstructing my hair while getting dressed.  A lounge area offered infused water and cookies and magazines.  I was encouraged by staff to take all the time I wanted and was never rushed.

This is a terrific restaurant concept. Enjoy high end furnishings and design, and select from a menu prepared with people on the go in mind,  The posh ambiance is offset by a walk up window where burgers can be ordered for $5, fries $3.50, and soda for $2.25.

Haven't visited here since c.2005.  But it's a fixture on the strip, and home to talented ceramists.   I keep a cute, terra cotta, moon faced key holder on my wall at home as a cherished souvenir.

This is way too much like walking into Daddy Warbuck's little girl's closet while she's away at school hazing new sorority sisters. Whew.  No mistaking who lives here, with all the giant T's and B's in metal and leather and fabric on every item.    The true rush of owning a Tory Burch pair of shoes or conspicuously grand handbag is the reaction of other women.  omg.  I mean, OMG.    So for the label pullers and saliva losers who care, I shopped for shoes and a bag.  omg.  I mean really, OMG.   I will accept a cool drink while they run the charge.

Arcadia farms poached the cutest house with enclosed yard and converted garage. The vintage cottage is is now a charming restaurant filled with clothed tables and a lot of luncheoning ladies.  There was an original Arcadia Farm when the neighborhood was farmland a few decades ago.  The grounds and homestead are behind an adobe wall acorss the street - where a valet does a good job of keeping away looky-loos' preying eyes.    My ham sandwich was delcious.  Crispy. toasted bread and ample filling.  We began with a signature app - the melted brie, topped with roasted apple and surrounded by strawberries.  Then to really complete the arterial damage, we savored a wonderful coconut cake.  Desserts are made each day in the bakery across the street.    Service was good and amusing.  The sun was out, but winds up to 50 mph whipped the courtyard and slammed doors while we ate in the former garage.  A door leads to the kitchen.  The weather plagued the cooks and the bewildered server as they worked to keep the food coming.   Our server kept popping in and out of the slamming kitchen door like a cuckoo in a clock.  Well done!

Great idea for a niche market created out of a few regular salon services.  I had my hair washed, which is a luxury for me. But the real luxury is the scalp massage.  I could have been done at that point, and gone out into the streets with wet hair and a cat like grin on my face.  Next was the actual blow out.  Hair dryers hang from the ceiling like pendant lights.  That makes so much sense because they are up and away and still within the operators' reach.    The salon is bright and modern and staffed with sweet young things.  My stylists said that their clientele is mostly wedding and bachelorette parties. Individual customers range from 15 to 50.  yikes, I kinda pushed the envelope on that one.  For $35, got a smooth do for the evening out.  Very enjoyable.

Wish these folks were closer to where I live.  I miss this place already!  A seasonal poblano was available.  Score!  Chock full of chicken and fruit and coddled in an almond. white sauce.  Fabulous.  We also ordered the miraculous quak.  Someone in the kitchen who is quite skilled in the handling of pomeganates (I think that's hard!)  laced the quak with plump, fresh seeds.  Great touch.  No watered down Tex-Mex culture here.  There are fabulous paste-ups on the windows of black & white Madres.  Another mural inside has the Dia del Muertas skulls.  Small skulls encusted with sparkle are at the cash register for purchase.  It's in a strip mall within Old Scottsdale, so parking can be a challenge.  Walk, baby!

This is a funky, on the run kind of place for bar food.  But the sweet potato fries were great, and the black bean burger - though small - was very tasty with a moist texture.  The bloody Mary was a steep $13.95, but when requested to be "spicy" - wooHoo - it could have arrived with a fireman's escort.  Loved it.  The tables are close enough to each other that no one is a stranger.  Frankly, that's a good thing too.  Say hello to somebody once in a while, y'all.  It can warm your soul as easily as a Bloody Mary can stoke your insides.

Really fun place for everyone to have breakfast.  There are puce vinyl booths with tall sides on the interior, and a long bar with seats both inside and on the sidewalk.  Misters hover in the overhang for when misters are necessary to keep patrons chill.  Servers are in track shoes and pastel sports gear.  Orders do come out of the kitchen quickly, but come on - Do we really need that visual reminder of how that all happens?   I had a pulpy orange juice - delicious.  And a guilty short stack. Also delicicous.  But fair warning.  Food should be cooked, not ready to be spit out.  The sausage links were pink, warm, and as far as I could tell, closer to raw than cooked.  Without prompting, the server took them off the table as well as off the check.     Gotta run.  Hope to see you here again soon.

This is a dark corner to enjoy.  My friend and I had a brief time to bridge one Strip destination and a ticketed show, so we ducked into Javier's for an appetizer and drink.    Javier's allure is its atmosphere as much as its convenient location in the svelte Aria.  Everything in Vegas that is worth seeking out is "through the casino."  We passed raucous sports bars and slot machine cha-chinging walkups before choosing Javier's for its quieter mood.  It has metal studded ceilings, carved wood banquets, and heavy leather table tops and lounge seating  The piped in music was definitely an amusing background - looping on reggae during our hour's visit.    We added to the cosmopolitan mix by ordering French martinis - not cheap at $17 each.  A value totally underestimated until we rose to our feet and discovered the liquid power that could have launched us to  the ionosphere.  But since we only hoped to get to the show "through the casino,"  the libations were perfect rocket boosters.  Food served at the adjoining table showed impressive presentation.  I can only tell you about the chips that were served warm next to attractive cups of red and green salsa.  Speaking of feet.  Yes, see paragraph 3.  My friend was suffering from all those trips Through the Casino.  The kindly waitress dipped into her own purse and presented three bandaids to sooth the blister that surfaced while one toe fought with the other to be first on the escalator, tram, revolving door, taxi, carpet, marble floor, etcetera etcetera...An interesting, very girl-to-girl, hospitable way to earn a well-deserved tip.

You have to love this patio style restaurant that opens to the masterful Desert Botanical Garden.  Ingredients for my lunch were super fresh.  Service is fast.  It's a very popular place, but you can beat the crowd thing by taking a seat at the bar. It's possible to dine here without paying Garden admission, I noticed. I gobbled a blue cheese burger without pausing even once to wonder if watercress stems were hanging out between bites. Yum!

This designer shop lines up with lots of luxury designer shops along the air conditioned corridors of Fashion Square.  A friend asked me to scout the latest of Michael Kors' bags.  Got some lovely choices for her.  But it seems that the staff is commissioned.  That makes for an uncomfortable, subtle kind of salesperson aggression during any visit.  ew.

This is the storied epicenter of single life in Scottsdale since 2008.   WET is the week-end pool party held on the second floor of the Starwood's W Hotel, Scottsdale.  A bouncer guards a velvet rope at the foot of an open stairway that rises to a bar with misters, a large pool with infinity edge gutters, and lots of large cushioned lounges.  Private cabanas with bottle service can be reserved for $350 a day.  The party goes on from 11 AM to 5 PM.  Live,  popular DJs provide a club beat that greets anyone arriving at the W.  Expect a young crowd (Are those girls really old enough to drive?  Are those guys cutting class?)  strutting fit and often enhanced bodies in revealing suits, large floppy hats, designer sunglasses, and high heels. And of course, reality show worthy TV tans.  All that WET scene seems like a whole lot more work than when I was 18.

Five star for popovers. Light, airy, served with rounds of regular and herbed butter. Gorgeous interior with Luxe Mag detail, from antique repro seltzer bottles as bathroom soap dispensers, to fresh herbs between rows of butcher block tables.  Five star for an inventive menu. Though not 100% to my personal taste, the Caesar with roasted Brussels sprouts was interesting. I like both, but I discovered that I prefer them separate.  The Caesar salad was anchovy traditional rather than creamy, if you are one to differentiate.
