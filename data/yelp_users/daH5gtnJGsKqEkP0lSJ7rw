French press is fantastic.  House-made, from-scratch baked brioche is great.  No Wi-Fi, thus, great for reading and/or talking.  Hardly ever crowded.  Cleanest bathroom I have seen in a Tempe coffee house.

August, the owner, is a wise businessman, but more importantly a wise coach of coaches. The coaching team he has assembled is phenomenal. Even though EVCF is the most competitive Olympic Weightlifting gym in AZ and finished the best in AZ at the CrossFit Regionals last year, they are still very accessible to those who aren't interested in athletic competition, but rather are simply interested in getting into better shape. Everyone is coached differently because everyone has different needs. I have been a member for almost two years and don't plan on going anywhere else. In addition, the gym is a fantastic community. Camaraderie and "sibling rivalry" are abundant. Join now. The fourth best decision I have made in my whole life was to join East Valley CrossFit. The fifth best was to get my wife to join.

Meh. Watery margaritas and egg role esque mini chimis. Good happy hour prices.   Welcome/service is barely acceptable. Awkward entry way.   It looks like it could have a great patio, but it was closed.

Tim (the barber in front) has been cutting my hair for years. I have also had cuts from the other guys. Always great service, great classic cuts, and great products. Beer while you wait.
