Never go here for a family celebration. My family made reservations here for my graduation dinner, but they gave our table away and set us up in the bar instead. At one point they acted like we didn't have a reservation even though we dropped off a cake that morning. This was fine once fixed, but once happy hour started we were pushed out. Literally pushed out and the waiters threw my gifts onto the floor while they were trying to clear the table and get us out. The waitress messed up all of our orders and when we asked for patron margaritas she insisted on giving us house margaritas, which were nasty. The reason she wanted to give us house margaritas was because they were pre made. Horrible graduation dinner.

Best dry cleaner in Tempe! I have gone to them all and this location is by far the best. They actually clean your clothes where other locations just use dirty solution and ruin your clothes

Well I have to change my review. The first time I went the service was good for a cheap price. Since then the prices have fluctuated. Once I was completely overcharged. On this visit I had requested 2 items dry cleaned and the rest laundered. When I came to pick them up 2 extra items were dry cleaned instead of laundered. It was the manager who took my clothes so I'm assuming she decided she would choose what to dry clean and launder. This ended up costing me an extra 8 dollars. Plus I was overcharged for the laundered shirts. I didn't automatically write a review until this morning when I took my suit jacket out to wear and it is covered in little white hairs! I do not own cats etc so I know it is from the cleaners. Gross I have no choice but to wear it today, but I will not be back.

This place sucks! Second time they broke my lug nut while changing my tires. Do not go here!   Plus they are rude and don't care!

Came here for new brake pads on my front two wheels. After having new brake pads installed I left happy. However, down the road a few blocks I couldn't stop! Come to find out there was air in the system. The place I took it to also informed me that my back brakes were crumbling. Brake masters never even checked! Usually the guys check everything out and tell you what's going bad etc. not this place...they will let you drive off and possibly kill yourself in an accident. Do not go here and do not send your loved ones here. They just may die on the way out... Seriously I'm not trying to be dramatic, that incident was scary!

Very low budget dry cleaner. I would only recommend this place if you don't care about your clothes, but if that was the case you'd probably be washing them yourself. Thus, do not go here!   One of my shirts came back with a gummy substance on the collar. Yuck.   And my sweaters came back with safety pins in the sleeve to hold the service tag. Not acceptable! Little holes like that lead to rips. Most dry cleaners put those tags through the recommended wash tag etc. to avoid ruining the garment.   I will definitely not be going back here.

I'd previously given this place a bad review, but being that they are the only low cost cleaners around I tried them again. So far, my experiences have been good. My shirts and suites come out nice and I haven't had a gummy substance on my collar since my first visit.

Worst place for dry cleaning and laundry.  Do not take your clothes here.  The machines and detergent they use are cheap, which leaves odors in your clothes.  Go elsewhere. I now go to Perma Cleaners. Way better in my opinion!

Best burger downtown! Love this place! Order a cheeseburger and you will not be disappointed. The owner provides good customer service. The food is done fast.    P.s. I always request well done to prevent any pink in the middle.

I went to dinner with my parents and ordered a steak. Everything was great, but as I cut into my steak I cut into a paper wrapper that was left on? The manager/waiter was nice and brought out a new steak, but by the time it came out we were done with everything else. Basically, it ruined my meal and in return ruined our family dinner. The manager have us a free piece of cake, but really since we had to take the food home and will probably never reheat it the food that was messed up should have been comped.   We all agreed that we will not be going here again.   If you do go -- do not order a steak!

Best tasting cake I have ever had from a bakery! My mom went here for my law school graduation cake and it turned out amazing. The staff made sure it was what we ordered! I highly recommend this bakery!

Amazing food! Every sandwich is great, produce and meat is fresh, and service is perfect.   They now deliver! And the service is great. They came within the time frame, and he sandwich tasted like I was eating it there. Delivery driver was friendly. Will definitely order from the again!   Oh and they now have a bar inside the location. This place is definitely upgrading :)

amazing pizza! I was hesitant at first after reading that their sauce was sweet, but I'm glad I gave it a try. So good it's hard to explain.   Meats are incredibly high quality. The cheese is to die for and they put so much on ... Omg goodness!   Plus they deliver!

Do not go here! They do not know what they are doing and they will try to sell you things that are not required. However, they never tell you what's required and what is not. They just try to suck money out of you.   Also, they take advantage of women so beware!!

This is my favorite spot in Tempe. I usually order for delivery, but I have dined in a couple times.  The place is family run so the employees actually care.   Delivery is consistent 30-40 min.  Drivers are nice.   Food is great.  I am picky with my Chinese food and this place meets my standards.  The vegetables are always hot yet crisp so I know they use fresh vegetables. Unlike other places where the vegetables are soggy.   Spice can be altered on every dish on a scale from 1 to 10. I usually order the level 4 spice, which is really spicy for me, but oh so good.   Basically, best Chinese place in Tempe!

Horrible food. I usually love Outback, but this location is horrible. I ordered the steak and lobster. Lobster was way over cooked and my steak tasted like a cheap Walmart steak. It was hard to swallow, that's how bad it tasted. Then our waitress broke my debit card while away and didn't even mention it. I found out when she returned my card and walked away.

Kristen Petrich is my stylist and she is the all time best! Super friendly! She really knows how to listen to the client to make sure they are happy are get what they came in for. I recommend her over any other stylist.

I personally do not recommend coming here for auto maintenance. They are called Danny's Family Car Wash for a reason, and that being they only really know how to do car washes. Auto maintenance like oil changes and filter replacements are purposely over priced and the employees almost purposely try to not sell service upgrades etc. I was surprised no one suggested a new filter, air pressure check, etc. one employee started to offer vacuuming, but he was cut off because another employee told him his offer was too low! Well there goes my business! Such a shame because the owner of this place is the one losing business because his or her hourly employees would rather stand around and talk to each other rather than to customers about available auto options. Seriously, there was probably 6 guys just standing around the entire time. I see this place going bankrupt in less than 5 years if this is how they treat every potential customer.   I usually go to full circle, where they are big on auto maintenance and then throw the wash/vacuum in for free. Full circle knows how to provide customer service, unlike this place. I was never even offered maintenance options at Danny's. The people were nice, but just idiots in terms of sales and customer service. I will never go back!

Manager Alex is really a good manager.  He honored a price mix-up for me, when really he didn't have to. I was in a hurry and not in the best mood, but he looked past it and made everything exceptional. I will definitely go to this location again. I hope this comment is reviewed by upper management. Alex is qualified to run this store!

Very rude girls. I don't like this place at all. Yes they are clean, but they are disrespectful. I waited forever even with an appt, and after that I was treated horrible. I will not go back and I advise anyone else to go somewhere else.

This place is nice and clean, but it is not as described. It is not a foot massage place!  I went here last night for an intense foot massage. I scheduled my visit ahead of time and indicated I wanted an hour long foot massage. Well I received a 10 minute foot massage that was not intense along with some weird back rub. The rub really did nothing for me. I was so disappointed that I didn't want to tip, but did so because I felt it was the right thing to do. Therefore, if you want a good foot massage go elsewhere. If you just want an Asian to touch you go here.

I loved this place.... Until it was sold a couple weeks ago. New owner just isn't the same. I will say he is improving. I have seen him help out a lot more. However, the baristas have changed and the new ones are horrible. Complete a holes. Seriously! I use to tip, but now I never do! And I only go to this place when I'm in a rush :(   So basically okay coffee, average prices, and horrible baristas!

Worst water service company I have ever dealt with. First, the water tastes like crap! Really, like tap water. Second, billing has been an issue since day 1 with this company. They will charge you for bottles you never received or received with leaks. Third, the water bottles they deliver look like they have never been washed, which is really concerning when it comes to drinking out of them. When I contacted the company about the issues they never resolved them. In fact, the employees are rude and uneducated. Go through someone else. Trust me on this one!!

I was NOT impressed with this hummus. I bought some original hummus at my local farmers market this past weekend, and when I got home I noticed that the hummus was a weird brown color and the taste was just not good.

Amazing pizza! I was skeptical due to some of the not so good reviews, but I gave them a try and I'm glad that I did.    Ingredients are fresh! Sauce is delicious. Bread is just okay, but that's what makes it so good.   Delivery did take a long time. 75 minutes to be exact, but it was worth it. Go for one of the specials so the price stays low.

Food is good and delivery is fast. However, all of the drivers are super rude about the coupons. Like come on...no one is trying to rip you off... You'll get your stupid coupon back!!! It's like they expect you to not have the coupon when they ask for it. They next time I order I will not be tipping! How about the next few times to get my point across!

Delivery was quick. The driver was professional. Food was right out of the oven. Nice quantity and quality. Reasonable price, and they do not overcharge for delivery fees.   Marinara is really really good!
