Okay, first of all, this place looks like it would be located in the slums of San Salvador.. sketchy area, bars on the window, almost looks lifeless from the street. "Never judge a book by its cover" definitely applies to this place. This place has some good and very authentic Salvadorian food. Came here and got my usual choice of salvi treats, pupusas revueltas, pastelitos, platanitos and an ice cold agua de ensalada... AMAZING!

Its Applebees, nothing wow about it, just the happy hour deal. Came to this place one evening on a weekday with my brother and his Fiance for drinks. There was a woman at the table next to us who honestly should had been cut off a long time ago, she was so sauced up, loud and obnoxious that our time spent there was ultimately just unpleasant, after much observation, she seemed to know the staff, what do you know, she works there. UNPROFESSIONAL. Not returning to this location anytime soon.

I snicker a little as I read these reviews about the pizza not being "authentic New York" Pizza(doesn't just about every pizza parlor add "new york" to the mix?).. well, let me welcome you to Arizona =) I live right across the street from this place and never noticed it. Decided to give it shot and this place has become a weekly ritual. The pizza bianco(white sauce) is my personal favorite =D

What can I say? This place is AWESOME! Great place to meet up with friends for a few beers and chat or watch a game. My favorites would have to be Kiltlifter and the Peach Ale, I also enjoy the pumpkin porter around this time of year. The food is great as well. Must Try's are the Arizona chicken rolls, beer bread sandwiches and the popper burger(bomb!).

LOVED this place until I found a fly in my pita today, the waitress was such a doll and took it back, brought me a new one and didnt charge me, but still sad to say, I won't be coming back to this location again.

I used to love this place, the broth was so flavorful. Came in one day, slid over the tray of condiments and hey what do you know, cockroach. Tried to brush it off, moved over to a new table. The waitress brought us thai tea.. tiny roach in the thai tea. By this time, we got up and left. The owner followed us out and says "You're not coming back are you?" F**k no I am not! Beware, you have been warned. Contacted the health department, you can find my email in the pics above =)

Where do I even begin with this place? Ive been in love since the first taste! long before I even moved to Arizona, my brother would always bring us here when we would come to visit and it was pretty much my favorite place to eat at. The pizza is just amazing... the wings are great and I love the julius ceasar salad with chicken. Staff is super nice and very helpful.  One saturday afternoon, a co-worker and I decided to have pizza and beer here one afternoon since she had never been, she accidently knocked over her cup which shattered on the floor(no, we werent drunk... yet). The staff waiter cleaned it up right away and brought her a new one. Great place.

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I ordered from this place one night pretty late maybe about 1:30, after about a little over an hour I still didnt receive my pizza, so I called the store and they had the driver call me back, I stated my address as clear as possible, "SOUTHERN AVE" and this genius delivered to "7th avenue" really? why the hell would anyone order from somewhere that far away? Never got my pizza because they were closed by than, did I forget to mention that they had charged my card for it too? never ordering from this rat hole again.

Hands Down the best Mexican food I have ever had in Arizona. You know the food is legit when you have to order in Spanish. The combination plates are a nice selection for indecisive eaters. I had a Torta al pastor with a taco de asada. The meat was deliciously seasoned and juicy, no where near dry. They also have a salsa bar with 3 types of salsa, as well as fried jalapenos and pickled items. Can't wait to return, I may have just found my new regular spot.

This place might not be so "visually appealing" thats okay, im not coming in to admire the floors and walls, I come for a tan, in and out. Stopped in here over the weekend and took advantage of some of the deals I was offered. The girl behind the counter was very informative. Cant complain.

This place has an awesome happy hour, did I mention its all day on sunday? We usually come to this place for some sake bombers and some of their infused sakes after a long day of work or a relaxing afternoon on the weekends. Service is pretty fast, the waitresses are gorgeous, cool environment. Last night my sister in law decided to have her birthday dinner get-together here, we reserved on of the karaoke rooms, alot of fun!

New to the tempe area and needed a new barber, oddly enough found these guys on IG and decided to stop by since they are right down the street from where I live. Usually I'm very careful about who I let cut my hair, been going to the same person for years now but considering they are 400+ miles away, that's not gonna work when I need a cut every 2 weeks. Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon, they were pretty busy but these guys are fast, don't like to wait? Try supercuts, you're not gonna get a quality cut there as you would here.  awesome environment, and did I mention Free beer while you wait?! Check out their artwork while you have a cold one. Timmy, hands down is a pro, knows his cuts, very detailed and on point, definitely found my new barber.

This place was absolutely AMAZING.  The area looks a little sketchy, tucked in a little plaza that you could drive right past and not even know it was there. My office happens to be just a few blocks away from this place, one day I was craving some mexican food for lunch but I was looking for something a little more authentic than Filibertos(blehhh). Being hispanic, Im pretty critical and picky when it comes to eating at a hispanic establishment, this place was spot on with the flavors. I walked in right way and was greeted by 2 latin women at the counter, the set up was kind of like a burrito bar, like chipotle in way(only way better) you start by choosing your burrito, then your veggies and other toppings, the burrito was as big as a baby! amazing burrito... and that jalapeno cream cheese!!! heaven.

I always stop here whenever im in Vegas, its a MUST. However, ever since they moved into their restaurant across from their old location, I feel as if the quality in the food has gone down somewhat.

This place has some pretty good stuff. I usually come here for breakfast with my brother on saturdays after a night out for some recovery drinks at their bar and my usual favorite sandwich, "The natie bomb".

LOVE IT!   Came here with a friend who recommended it. Upon entering, the atmosphere was really chill, lots of interesting stuff to add into one bowl. After chatting with the owner, discovered he actually studied his craft in Japan and that his noodles arrive fresh from a trusted source in California, real cool guy, attentive staff. excellent on a cold day!

Music is always good and always bring excellent talent. The only thing that sucks about this place is the crowd! your typical stuck up, roided out scottsdale snobs.

This place was GREAT!  I happen to live right across the street from this place and always pass it walking across the lot to the gym. One lazy sunday upon awakening with a roaring stomach, no desire to cook, still tired and slightly hungover, I decided to give this palce a try for take out. Upon entering the place, I noticed most of the customers eating here were of asian decent, seeing asian patrons at an asian restaurant tells me the food is legit. I was greeted right away by a man at the counter(who I am assuming is the owner). I asked him what noodles does he recommend, I went with the pan fried shaven noodles. For a drink, he recommended I tried an asian apple soda(which was great, by the way). As i waited for my food, he brought me some water and also a sample of a taro smoothie, which was AWESOME! My food was ready pretty quickly. The noodles were pretty thick, pan fried to perfection, No need for any sauce at all, topped with a crispy breaded chicken, HUGE portions. Overall, I would definitely come back and recommend this place, the service is what ultimately had me give them 5 stars =)

This place deserves 0 stars WOW, this had to be THE worst experience I've ever had in any type of customer service environment. First of all, I shouldn't have to get up more than once to have a request fulfilled. We came with a party of 4, ordered a few margaritas, 2 appetizers and 2 tacos. We literally waited 45 minutes to get our stuff and only AFTER we told the waitress and manager a handful of times. We never even got our tacos, we were just fed up and left. Next time you want something done right at this place, don't waste your time. Go to the Scottsdale location, this ones a joke.

This place is great.  Kind of like a middle eastern chipotle. Bowls and the fresh juices are my go-to's.  My ONLY complaint is that they recently changed the size of the bowl(smaller) and you're still paying the same price..And trust me.. they are NOT the same size lol.

I'm a California native, so I was a bit surprised to see a Blaze pizza pop up randomly in Tempe. I consider myself a "self proclaimed pizza snob". Detail and the freshness of the ingredients is everything.   With that being said, this is probably by far the best experience I've had at any pizza joint and it could not had been done without the general manager Nicole, and her staff. Nicole, if you ever read these reviews, remember this face, because you will be seeing it more often!
