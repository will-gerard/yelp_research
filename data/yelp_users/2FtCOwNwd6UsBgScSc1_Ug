The Science Center has a lot of great things to offer.  I recently went for one of their "Adult Night Out" presentations -- this is a series of speakers and/or presentations tailored for a more mature crowd.   They hold them the first Friday of every month (which coincides nicely with the Artwalk).  Their normal displays need  to be updated or rotated a bit more often.  I've been there several times since last winter -- and they have not changed out the displays once.  They get additional points for the BodyWorld exhibition and planetarium (but these are extra charge).  I also wish they could offer validation for parking -- as it can get pretty expensive.

Lovely little space--the cafe is an old repurposed Phoenix home with plenty of patio space.  Very quaint.  The service was super friendly, and the seating areas were comfortable with enough privacy to have conversation.   I enjoyed their weekend brunch with Mimosa's. Food was solid breakfast fare with medium sized portions.  Most of the dishes had a slight Mexican flare (chorizo with the eggs Benedict, corn tortillas on the side, etc). My boys got the "Miga" eggs and their exact review was: I like these eggs, they are delicious. So there you go - positive reviews from a picky 5 year old.  The adults enjoyed their meals too. I do wish their mimosa glasses were a bit larger - but that is probably just the boozer in me talking. The prices were more than fair. Overall enjoyable experience!

I've been to the Desert Botanical Garden many times, and each time it gets more enjoyable.  When I first moved to the Phoenix -- I was totally ignorant to all the beauty of desert life.  This garden has helped me to see the errors of my ways.  There is so much variety to be found between cacti and succulents.  As well as a multitude of desert critters :)  There are several events hosted throughout the year to make DBG worth revisits -- Flashlight Tours, Jazz in the Garden, Butterfly Exhibits, etc.  The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The grounds are well manicured and well planned out (wide meandering trails, specialized gardens, nice garden shop and folk art displays).  It's great for both family and singles alike.  Lately, there has been a bit of construction as they have been improving their garden... but I don't mind, cause its all in an effort to make the place more enjoyable.

Love this zoo (and I say that coming from San Diego). Well laid out, a variety of animals and displays. Their conservation work is commendable.  They always seem to be upgrading things - better habitats for the animals, more research areas, banquet halls, etc.  I like that each time I come I see more improvements.  It is an absolute mad house during the holidays--come early or expect to park in the overflow lot a mile away!

Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. I love this spot! The food is great, the dining vibe is perfect (think cozy wine cellar) and all the staff are friendly. I mostly have visited for lunch, so prices are decent. Not sure how the dinner prices compare.   Tip: Stay away from he fresh bread... It is sinfully delicious, and you will not have willpower to leave room in your stomach for entrees (and they are worth it!)

The Good - food, shopping for worthless  tchotchkes, nice patio, dog friendly.  The Bad - overcrowded, listening to the boring yuppie a-holes is unavoidable, dogs everywhere.

Somehow, I have neglected to review Postino Arcadia... so let me correct that mistake.  And now that there are 300+ positive reviews on here -- this is just to pile on the love.  Love the atmosphere Love the food (the bruschetta! my mouth is watering now...) Love the friendly service Love the location Love live music (though it can disrupt conversations)   The only "don't Love"?  Parking.   But that is a small price to have a nice spot to enjoy food with friends.

In this spot, I ingested the world dullest Cobb salad and a watered down Arnold Palmer. My accompanying bread roll was hard enough to break a tooth, so I could not partake.  At least the prices were not outrageous.

When I first pulled up, I wasn't even sure this place was open (still on  usiness). All the windows and doors are completely blacked out. But I tried the door and yay! Success.  Pho is dirt cheap, and still tasty.  I opt for chicken and veggies is my Pho- which was not on menu... But they served up, no problem. Service was fast even durin flinch peak. Will be back.

Nice little wine bar.  I enjoyed a flight of whites and one of their specialty salads for lunch.  Pretty tasty.  The food won't win any culinary rewards, but it is good and the ingredients seem fresh. Minor niggle, they only seem to have high-top seating... when all I want to do is curl up in a booth and drink myself silly, this can be a problem.

I've been to the Liberty Market several times and they never disappoint.  The men in my family always go for the wood fired pizzas (which are superb).. but for those who want a healthier option--their salads make for filling and guilt-free eating.    The place is always moderately busy, but never so packed that you can't get prompt service.  Plus, there is plenty of inside and outdoor/patio area to park your plates.  Even the bathrooms are well kept and clean.  This place has become a family staple.  Fair Warning:  The red velvet cake will make you an addict.

Scottsdale is great for parks, there are so many great options to go around. But of all the parks in the city, this is my favorite.  The Railroad Park has so many features for entertaining the whole family, its simply hard to beat: - Plenty of open grass space - Several Ramadas for birthday partying - Two separate "park" areas. One with swings, gyms, etc. and another with an old adobe village (great for stagecoach robberies and western heists).  If you are a mother of boys, this is especially nice. - The train theme (hence the name)... which means old train cars and tracks throughout - A mini-train ride and merry-go-round - Refreshment vendors and a General Store with ice cream - Beautiful model train museum  This park is always clean, well maintained and they are frequently making updates to improve the experience.

Can get a bit crowded -- not uncommon to see a line leading out the door on weekends.  Couple this with the fact that servers are in no rush to seat people...   Still, a great place to grab quality sushi.  And the prices are not outrageous.

Low key day spa with excellent yoga classes! I haven't used the actual spa, so I can't comment on that.  The overall facility is clean, well staffed, with a relaxing atmosphere.  There is a small assortment of yoga and spa gear in the lobby to shop or kill time while waiting for a class. The yoga classroom is just the right size for a small-medium sized class.  It can get a little crowded for the more popular classes, but it still feels welcoming.  The room is not kept in the usual air conditioned deep freeze (which I appreciate), so your muscles can remain warm and loose.  I don't really enjoy the extreme heat of Bikram, so this is a nice compromise.  I don't know how this will fair during the Phoenician summers, but for now I am enjoying. Check it out!

One of the best things about living in Scottsdale are all the wonderful parks. Chaparral is the best one to start with--smack in the middle of the city, very large and full features. There is a huge walking trail, you will see moms with strollers, joggers and dog walkers galore. But aside from the very nice walking/bike trail, there are several grassy areas for soccer or picnics, baseball diamonds, a fishing lake, and the standard playground area (with shade tents). An aquatic center and plenty of wildlife rounds it all off. Only complaint is that I'd like to see better hours at the aquatic center. It would also be nice if the building was updated/enlarged, so they could include fitness classes (similar to the Cactus park location).  In all this park is still a great place to workout, play, picnic, or read. The people and dog watching is pretty good too.

What a fantastic find! Great toy store with so many selections in every age range. They have classic style toys for a toddler: riding/wheeled items, balls, dolls and building sets in every variety (duplo, blocks, magnetic).  Plus the bigger kid section with electronic games, board games, educational items, and kid crafting (yarn, jewels, rubber bands, paints, etc). Modest selection of reading books but many more activity/coloring books-an impressive variety with items I've not seen elsewhere. There is also a small selection of decor type items for a kids room or clothing accessories.   You can find many sales items and range of prices, but to give you an idea--$80 for large toy set, $25 for block set, $2-5 for small take and toss toys. Overall the prices range from mid to high, but quality is higher than you would get at local Wal-Mart. Totally worth it.   Go, you won't be disappointing.

Great sports bar! Plenty of TVs, indoor/outdoor seating, full bar, fair selection of beers on tap and bottled. The atmosphere is what you might expect of a sports bar- loud. So don't come here if you want to enjoy conversation. But on the plus side, if you have loud children, this is one restaurant where it is no problem. Also, service is fast and friendly, so no waiting when the kids are reaching nuclear detonation. Food is good, no complaints. The skillet brownie is worth skipping dinner altogether.

Great Food & Service, No Frills!  This place is wonderful for a quick sandwich, soup, or pickle during your lunch break.  I had their Turkey and Avocado sandwich -- and it left my mouth watering long after the sandwich was gone.    They also have a great selection of Dr. Brown sodas (as well as the normal fountain selection).

This is one of your typical hole-in-the-wall type local restaurants.  It's just a small eatery -- not very chic, and not in the best location for foot traffic.  But I consider it to be one of the best Sushi spots in Phoenix.  The service is great, prices are fair, and the food is wonderful.  No frills, just nice fresh sushi!  Try coming in for lunch, to catch their specials.

High price for only so-so food.  I didn't bother staying for the Flamenco dancer... the poor atmosphere was a turn off (large empty room, shabby decor).  One positive: the service was friendly and responsive.

Really wanted to like this place, but my experience here was not too impressive. It started off great - the decor is nice, we were greeted and seated promptly.  Then out came a plate of basil and onion, with basket of delicious pita bread.  This kept our appetites at bay, while we awaited our waitress.    Then it slid downhill... the waitress took awhile to get to our table and take our drink order.  By the time she arrived, I had already eaten half my pita basket, browsed my iphone for meaning of Gheimeh (it means "stew" in Persian), played with game apps while my husband left for restroom, read entire menu together and decided on meal.  Said waitress eventually arrived to get our full order, then we proceeded to wait some more.  We made conversation and entertained ourselves for 25 minutes, then I started to notice how long we were sitting.  That's when I began trying to make eye-contact with the waitress.  Unfortunately, she breezed by our table several times without stopping.   During this time, nary a glass was to be refilled.  After 35 minutes, we noticed another table with a large party (that sat down after us) was getting their food.  My husband actually suggested taking off - but I decided to wait it out.   Finally, after 45 minutes, our food arrived.  We ordered the Vegetable Gheimeh (remember kids, that means "stew") and the Lamb Loin meal.  Both entrees were just "ok".  The stew had vegetables that were cooked down to imperceptible mush and the flavor was entirely blah.   My husband's lamb entree was better, but also lacked much flavor.  Basmati rice was prepared fine, but still nothing special.   I didn't see or taste anything that would make me want to return.  Final verdict?  Save your money and visit another restaurant.  This one isn't horrible, but neither is it worth your time and money.

This rating is actually 2.5 stars.    I have a love/hate relationship with this gym.  The prices are not that great, but reasonable -- especially since the facilities are awesome.   There is a variety of weight machines on the bottom floor, and the upstairs is devoted to treadmills/ellipticals/stairmasters/etc.  Everything is clean, they have a juice bar, and I could probably live in the locker room. Plus, it is one of the rare gyms that has a basketball court, and day-care.  But... and here is the BIG but (no pun intended) --  The place is always crowded!!   If you join, You are doomed to do the following:   - spend precious workout time circling their parking lot for spots  - spend precious workout time waiting for a machine  - be forced into an aerobics class with a biz-zillion other females.  Unable to execute moves without kicking your neighbor, and unable to see your instructor through the sea of bobbing body-parts  - contemplate working out at ungodly hours or *gasp* the weekend, just to ensure your time is properly spent.  They are basically a victim of their own success.  But alas, it is the only gym  in my area that meets my needs... even if I spend much of my workout hour cursing.

One-half bistro, one-half wine store...  This restaurant is basically the back-room for AZ Wine Company.   You  enter through the wine store (where you can incidentally pick a bottle for dinner from their vast collection), then you make your way over to their dining area.  Don't worry -- if you purchase wine from their shop, they will wave the cork fee for dinner.  The cozy (read: teeny-tiny) bistro section, is dimly lit and sparse on  decor.  But if you happen to love candles and basic black everything, this is the spot for you.  Their menu is small, but the dishes are flavorful and well prepared.  Their website claims that the food is southwest inspired -- but that's not exactly how I would describe it.  The courses are more like French PLUS: French + Korean, French + Italian, French + Southwest... you get the picture.  The waiting staff is not only polite, and well informed about dishes, but discreet (i.e. they won't bug the hell out of you while you are trying to eat).  This is the perfect place to take a date.  NOTE:  The mapping feature doesn't accurately display where this business is located, so I uploaded a pic.  It is on Scottsdale Rd (just South of Thomas) in a rather non-descript shopping center, next to a beauty salon.  **UPDATE:  It looks like the map has been fixed :)

Sammiches, Simpsons, and brownies, oh-my!  Whenever friends from out of town visit, this is one of the first spots I take them to.  The sandwiches are awesome, and the environment is laid-back.  The "Mary Jane" theme is just an added bonus ;)

Complete revamp since the last time I visited and boy what an improvement! The old restaurant was great too, with tasty vegan entrees and a trendy vibe. But now they've added more seating, polished up decor, craft beers and even more food/drink options. You still get a hole in the wall local eatery vibe.. But with more flair.   Everything I've ordered has been tasty.  The mock chicken is pretty convincing. You can't beat the taste or price. Finally vegan doesn't feel like a deprivation.  (Full Disclosure: I am not vegan,  but I try it out at times).  Bonus, the coolers feature take-n-bake cookies from their sister restaurant, Nomi.   Bringing the kids? They have a kid friendly menu and cool coloring comic sheet while  waiting for your order.

This review is on the weekend brunch only--  Great medium sized (heavy-ish traffic) spot to hang out with friends and enjoy brunch.  The food selections is good, and their outdoor seating can't be beat.  They have the best huevos rancheros I've ever had in my life. The best eggs bennie too (with homemage english muffins)... but after tasting huevos rancheros, it's hard to bother with anything else.  The prices aren't  exactly budget friendly - but worth the occasional splurge.   Word to the wise: Mimosa's are bottomless only on Saturday - we mixed the days once and ended up spending 40 bucks on breakfast booze while the food was 20 :/

I wrote a review for LGO... but I realize it is more appropriate for the 'Grocery' section.  The Pizzeria section doesn't have near the same issue with overcrowdedness.  But you still have to contend with people sucking up valuable seating space while working on their ipads...

I go here often--because I live in a house full of males.  Males that must consume honey slathered carcasses on a regular basis.  Joe's is good BBQ, can't deny that.    But don't go if you care about variety, scene or a calorie intake.  I get the baked potato (cause it seems "sorta" healthy next to my other options).  But watch out!  Your reflexes have to be lightening quick in order to stop them from adding a pound of butter to the tater ;)    If you feel like splurging, the classic cokes in glass bottle are a wonderful add-on.  They also have an assortment of old-style candies.

Probably time to update this review.. I've been here quite a few times since last rating and they have definately improved.  As always, the food at D'lish is wonderful. Great combination of salads, unique and healthy sandwiches, a bonus of tasty protein shakes. The atmosphere is still good as well-kind of trendy, but good mix of students and locals. The parking and drive thru are still cramped (nothing they can do there), but they've improved the drive thru speed by taking orders carside during busy times. Which leads me to the biggest update... happily, the real change and improvement comes from their service. I remember a time when service here was slow and painful. No more. The new crew is pleasant, helpful and competent. Hallelujah.

How to describe anthro? Casual boho chic clothing at a _not_ so affordable price. The very best candles you can find for your home (say goodbye to cheap scents or wax induced headaches).  Sophisticated, feminine and casual home decor inspiration.  Coffee table books, server dishes, bedding, lampshades galore!  This place is not cheap, but I love everything in it!  Only shop sales, unless you have money to spare. Even then, you may find it hard to drop $60 on a cotton shirt... Also, beware the scarves, belts, hats and purses.  I have tons of them and have yet to wear half.  It is the ultimate guilty pleasure for the modern faux-hippie chick.  As for this location:  I like the Fashion Square Anthro because it has an outside entrance separate from the main mall.  Also, it seems to carry more candles and house items than other locations in the Valley.  However, if I want clothing I will visit other stores.  The sales rack here is way too popular and you have to compete with other ladies.

Helped me work through a very tricky problem with a drain blockage at my home.  I was starting to get very fed up and disillusioned with everyone I spoke to... Due to some crazy issues at my home--my water line under a neighbors property and the unfortunate decision of previous owners to cover our clean outs with several inches of dirt and desert landscape--we had gone through multiple plumbers and a long discovery process with the city, without much end in sight. But Ed was able to diagnose the problem and finally fix it!  A happy end to a potentially huge plumbing nightmare.

Great fresh sandwiches! Choose from their menu options or make to order. The indoor and patio seating is nice. They have trivial pursuit games to entertain you while you wait, or you can just look around at the kitschy decor.  Prices are a tad high for sandwiches, but not outrageous. I'll pay the extra to avoid Subway. I've never seen the same staff here... not sure if that may cause issues with speed or consistent quality. As others have mentioned, they can be slow. But in terms of quality-So far so good.  Parking is kind of a mess. Nothing they can do about that, but it really needs to be mentioned for customers. The lot has poorly designed ingress/egress, too few spaces and an oddly placed (borderline criminal) drive thru at a neighboring eatery. I say criminal, because it really is just an accident waiting to happen for drivers or god forbid a pedestrian. Drive thru wasn't active last time I visited, so maybe they are not opening it? In any case, the parking situation hinders your ability to get in and out quickly. Which is a huge factor for lunch.

They're evil. Terribly, terribly evil!  But alas, they are a necessary evil.  If you want to minimize the damage, try to cancel all your extended cable packages and up the Netflix subscription half the year.  Nothing worthwhile is on T.V. until fall anyway.  We usually do this every summer and are perfectly satisfied (but this year was Olympics, so no dice).  When it comes to the hi speed cable though-- I just bend over and take it.  Let's face it, DSL is just not up to par and please god spare me another Dish network contract of death.

Love this place.  A low key, local spot to get some authentic Vietnamese.  Not sure why there are such harsh complaints posted here.  I've been to the restaurant several times and the food/service/price have been spot on!  Even though it's called the "noodle" ranch, I usually get spring rolls and some entree... I am not one of those that judges Vietnamese spots by the Pho alone.  I've ordered their Pho and i've enjoyed, but there is much more on the menu to try.  The Thai Tea could be a bit sweeter/richer -- but maybe it's a good thing not to guzzle down liquid sugar.  P.S To the poster who claims their broth is bland: You can let the waiter know if you want extra heat ;)

4.5 Stars, minus .5 for atmosphere.  This is a low key spot (albeit crowded at times) with not much in the way of decor...  But the staff is friendly, and food is delicious!.  Rarely do I compliment others on their fried chicken (momma gets the top spot in my book) -- but I must admit, this place give my mother and grandma a run for their money.  And to top it off, the sweet potatoes are simply divine.  After you throw in some good old fashion sweet tea and moderate pricing, you know you've got a winner.   If you are looking for a trendy spot to dress up and people watch, this is not the place.  But if you are desperately in need of some down home southern treats, visit Mrs. White's.

Great location and lots of fun for all ages.  First, location wise you couldn't ask for better. It is in the center of Tempe Marketplace, very easy to find and right next door to the outdoor stage area. This is a nice area to hang outside if you get claustrophobic or just need a break from arcade-land.   As far as the venue, it's a pretty massive area. Bar, billiards, televisions and restaurant are up front; games and Carnie prizes are towards the back. The games only accept credits by way of a "Power Card", which needs to be reloaded at various kiosks around the floor. It is disturbingly similar to a Casino... and if you aren't careful, you can blow thru money nearly as fast. I like to negotiate a predetermined amount with my kids before entering the field. Fail to do this, and suffer the eventual sugarcrash-neon-meltdown. You've been warned.  Regarding their party planning service. This is my favorite part of DnB. I have now had two birthday kids parties here with my son's and a few adult graduation/birthday events.  It is such a fantastic venue! The staff really takes care of you. Just book your time slot, confirm number of people and show up. The decor/food/entertainment is all taken care of. There are different packages for any budget and they are very accommodating. If desired, you can bring in outside cake or additional decor. The only challenge is herding the kids, for young birthday parties. I recommend only parties with children old enough to "return to base". There are also semi-private rooms with large televisions, perfect for an adult or team party. Plus, the booze. Duh.  Really, nothing negative to say..  a rarity.

I come here for the oysters and a cadillac margarita.  And it is awesome, every time. They have possibly the best oysters in Phoenix (shhh!).  The kids gets fish and chips when we visit, and from what i've sampled, that is good too.  As for the rest of the menu?  Who knows.   The options are plentiful, but nothing inspires me to stray from my usual.  For whatever reason this place is not very popular, which means you can get a nice booth to yourself.  Steep prices, location, or fade-into-the-background vibe could be a factor for keeping others away...  but personally, I like that it isn't too crowded.  Sometimes you want  a spot to get away from noise and this fits the bill.

Best sashimi eating experience in the Valley.   When you come to Roka, do yourself and favor and spend the extra dollars to get the Omakasi! (you can get plain old sushi elsewhere)  After you order be prepared to spend 2-3hours leisurely enjoying your courses.  No sense rushing food this good.  Skip the soy sauce please--the fish is so fresh and flavorful, drowning it in soy would be a terrible waste.  The butterfish is perfectly dressed and tuna, salmon cuts are so delicate.  One particular cut of tuna was so wonderfully marbled, it melted upon contact with my tongue.  Dessert is just as nice, usually you finish with smooth ice cream flavors and fresh fruit.  I've been here several times now, and the service is always on point-waiters are attentive without being in your face.  The cocktails are also pretty good.  Although I've never tried their wine selection, they have enough selection on the menu to pass my inspection.

Love this spot!  The karaoke rooms are great (one of them even has a stripper pole), bathrooms WINNAR.  Drinks are super addictive.  The sushi is of the more Americanized variety -- but there are some decent options.  Plus, there is plenty of other bar food available - mini-cheeseburgers, chicken, etc.  all served piping hot with plenty of flavor.  Happy hour prices can not be beat!  I've been here on Friday/Saturdays and the atmosphere is great.  If you arrive early or on a weekday -- you can still enjoy the bar minus a crowd.

Great french pastry shop.  It mostly caters to breakfast & lunch crowd--but recently started serving dinner Wed-Sat.  I've never been for dinner, so my review is for day menu only.  The "breakfast" menu consist of pastries/croissants only... if you want the typical American egg dishes, look under the lunch heading.  I've had both their omelets and quiche's -- which are wonderful!  Also, the cafe mochas are not overly sweet (a la Starbucks) but still tasty.  Decor is semi-modern, but very laid back atmosphere.  Go check it out :)

Nice little Japanese restaurant. Has a good selection of sushi, sashimi, noodle dishes and drinks (full bar!).  It is not top notch sushi, but fair quality and very tasty. Dinner for four with a drink ran me about $60.  Not too shabby.

I struggle to find what people like about this place. Food is mediocre, service is typically slow, prices are nothing special. It doesn't have a local/quaint atmosphere to help it along either.   Everything about this place is completely shruggable. If there is no place left on your list to go, by all means eat here. But for me, I'll pass.

Quick service, Nice nail colors and pedicure options. The salon is clean and professional, but doesn't give you that "sterile" cold feeling of high end salons. I really like their spa chairs and the massage action--very soothing and not overly abusive. They spend a good amount of time massaging your legs and making experience enjoyable.   There were a lot of men working at this spa, which I was kind of skeptical about (admitted nail sexist), but I needn't worry-they did an excellent paint job. My pedicure looked flawless.  Prices are also fair- I got a middle tier spa pedicure for about $40 out the door (service plus tip).  My major gripe? The horrendous parking situation at Tempe Marketplace.  It gets more dangerous and comical every time I visit. Not the fault of the nail salon itself, but still a factor.

Everything you could want in a cozy neighborhood fine dining establishment.  The restaurant looks to be converted from a small home, so seating is pretty limited--but that just adds to the charm.  Location is very central to downtown Scottsdale, but enough off beaten path that it feels hidden.  Decor and atmosphere are a fun mix between country garden and creole soul.  Food excellent!  And if you sit inside, you get to enjoy watching Chef Chris work only a few feet away.  Its like dining at the home of a close friend--who happens to have an industrial grade kitchen, and can throw down in it.  To know, before you go: Cash only and BYOB.

Love, love, love.  Recently stumbled into this place after a day walking around the farmers market and downtown Scottsdale.  The atmosphere is amazing, kindof an industrial/old world Spanish feel (think Santa Fe Loft).  And they have a great serving staff--speedy, friendly and knowledgeably.  When I first sat down, I was a little put off by the prices.  I had brought my whole family along and didn't intended on quite the spendy dinner.  However, all the selections looked and tasted so wonderful!  By the end of the night I had ordered dinner entrees, drinks AND dessert.  The kids still won't stop talking about their fried bananas :)  I definitely plan to revisit, when I have more time and cash to enjoy fully.

Whats not to like? - Roach coaches with great food, pastries, or coffee - Quality produce from a few smaller farms and huge selection from McClendons farm  - Great organic items, grass fed beef, fresh caught fish.  Throw in a few live singers, breadmakers, the beekeeper with local honey, and a goat lady with natural lotion/soaps/etc...it's a winner.  Vendors are most plentiful during the fall, then they start to drop off as weather gets hotter.  But there is still enough shopping to enjoy during summer months.

A good old standby, when you can't think of anywhere else to go for breakfast or lunch.  I don't always go there (cause I like variety), but DD is on my favorites list.  Why?  Always crowded, but I get seated quickly. Always good food.   Always good service. Always a nice drink selection (full bar, yo!) Always solid.  And for that I am grateful.

Great clean facilities. My family has taken many summer swim classes here and it is one of the better maintained pools in Scottsdale. There is also more seating space, clean showers with private stalls and nice fitness rooms (both aerobic and weights). I've taken several of the fitness courses (yoga, Pilates, aerobic) and they are all pretty good. You get a variety of courses with knowledgeable instructors, uncrowded classes at fair price.    The park itself is ok. Not as big or geared towards outdoor fitness, like Chapparal. But there are still a few basketball courts, a grassy area and nice playground.  Recommended.

Great breakfast burritos and coffees on the go! They have a drive-thru lane... but don't skip out on the inside.  It's a cute little coffee spot to hang out--complete with shabby-chic decor, board games, and fun people.

Time for an update... Still love Buzzberry!  The food, the shakes, the vibe - it all works.  What doesn't? The constant turnover in staff.  New guys can't seem to find things, answer basic questions or ring you up fast without asking for assistance :(  They need to step up their game if they don't want to lose customers.  On several occasions, I have dropped out of the drive-thru cause they were too slow.

These guys rock! My car happened to die a few blocks from their shop, so they were only mechanic within walking distance. What a happy accident--they serviced my vehicle and had me back on schedule in no time (and with no BS). It's rare to walk away from car service without feeling abused.

It's Starbucks, so you know what to expect in terms of product. This location gets an above average rating because they have not screwed up my order too often and because it is closest drive-thru location on my way to work. The drive thru entry and exit is a little wonky--but this seems to be the case with all other Starbucks in this area (if I ever happen upon a Starbucks with a thoughtfully designed drive thru, I just may faint from the shock).

Essentially a sports bar, but has a more upscale flair. The decor is nice, and has very open layout--so an get a bit noisy. So be aware if you planned on having dinner conversation.  But because of the open atmosphere, it is great for groups and people watching.   I actually love the breakfast here. It isn't as popular as some of the other spots on Scottsdale strip--so you can get seated and served rather quick.  Also, it is a quick jaunt from the local farmers market, so you can stroll around afterwards.    The food is really good, fresh and well presented. I order hot tea for breakfast frequently-- and usually I just get an old Lipton bag with Luke warm water.  This place gave me a nice tray with quality tea, lemon slices and piping hot water in nice mug. Their side of fruit is also very nice -- you get a cup of fresh berries instead of the standard old honeydew chunks.  Dinner is equally nice.  You have the standard sports bar options (burgers, fries, etc.), but presentation and quality is stepped up a notch.

Very happy that this market opened. It is much more convenient than the grocery store: quick checkouts, easy to navigate, never crowded.  Great option when you are looking for a fast and healthy dinner.  I wouldn't recommend for bulk or full scale grocery shopping.  The store simply isn't that large.  Also, for the pickier health nuts--the produce is middle of the road quality.  You can find better options at a whole foods, but then again you don't have to drive the extra miles or pay whole food prices.   Warning: this is a busy corner and parking can sometimes be an issue at this location.

So happy to have found this restaurant, it was the complete package for night out.   First, the decor welcomes you in and sets the mood...  Beautiful lighting, check Miro artwork, check Beautiful bar area and classy place settings, checkity check.  Next up, the food and drink. I ordered the Paella de Pollo and a number of Tapas. Everything was delicious and came out hot and fresh from kitchen. No overwhelming spices and heat in these dishes--the flavors are more subtle and carefully prepared. Pre-dinner rolls were not the best, but I did not want to fill up on that anyway.  There was a decent wine selection and full bar for drinks.  Drinks have nice flavor but are not made strong, so if you are a booze hound, you've been warned.  The prices are medium-high, not outrageous for a restaurant in this area.  Finally the entertainment. This is just an added bonus that takes the restaurant to the next level.  You can enjoy Spanish guitar and Flamenco while dining? Yes. And it is fantastic.  Be aware, some people come just to enjoy the music, so there will be people hovering about the tables during the performance. It can get a bit crowded near stage (bordering on claustrophobic).  And while I enjoyed the atmosphere-some people might not. But if you love live music and the energy that comes with it, you wont be disappointed.  Definitely worth a visit or three. Muy bien!!

This is the only place I trust to do my waxing services. They have a nice relaxing facility with friendly and skilled staff.  I've been to a few other salons and the European Wax chain (horror show!), nothing compares in quality or comfort.

I go here so often, you'd think I would have reviewed by now. Zoolikins is a wonderful little baby boutique store!  If you are looking for cloth diapering, baby carrying or other granola child rearing necessities--this is the place. You can touch and feel a variety of diapers, take a class to learn how to use, pick up diaper safe laundry detergent, or just browse the variety of natural products available. The prices are pretty comparable to anything else you will find online, with the bonus of skipping shipping/delivery wait time. I love being able to preview my options and walk out the door same day with new "fluff". Staff are friendly and knowledgeable without being to "hover-y" while you shop.   Definitely put this store on your rotation if you are expecting or looking for a unique baby gift.

Happy hour here last until 6:30p, score. And they have a good variety of cocktails.  Food is solid. Not as many rice options as I would like. They concentrate more on curries, soups and noodle dishes.   There is an open dining area, so it can be a bit noisy, but not too bad. The atmosphere is sort of like a nightclub lounge, so not a big kid and family spot. But if your kiddos are older or reasonably behaved it shouldn't be a problem to bring them. There isn't booth seating, but they do  have booster seats available.

Nice facilities! The theater is on second level of building. So when you walk up, you immediately feel removed from the hustle and bustle of mall. Walking into this theatre, you have the feeling of entering a swanky night club--the decor is extra slick (almost bordering on cold), but it works, lighting is mellow, and there is open bar.   Once in the viewing room, the fun continues... Seats are very plush, recline smoothly, and you even get a blanket with small pillow to maximize comfort. The complimentary popcorn was completely unexpected but nice touch.  Added bonus, even from the furthest back seating-the screen is easily visible.  I notice that the front seats aren't too close either.  So truly, not a bad seat in house.

I'd love this place for its relaxing garden ambiance alone. Go to the full dining restaurant and eat indoors or pick up a few dishes from the deli area downstairs.  The downstair area does not have the full menu, but is designed to get a quick take out bite.  There is a nice little patio (complete with comfy chairs and misters), which is perfect for lunch when weather is good.  No matter where you dine--the food is healthy and tasty, plus moderately priced. Check out their Jasmine Green Tea for something refreshing--it is perfect sipping for a hot summer day. The dessert menu is extra tempting, but I have viciously beat back my sugar cravings and declined to give them a try.  If I ever order a dessert, I will revise this review and add my thoughts.    Parking is meh. It's old town Scottsdale, so good luck there. But if you find a spot, this place is near the canal and there is nice walking to be had after eating.

Great service, good food, so-so preparedness. I came for the Yelp Eats promotion, but one of the more popular items on the menu (scallops) had sold out. Usually, his would not be a problem, but I had already sold myself on the side item for this entree -- corn grits! And needless to say, this southern influenced girl was sorely disappointed not to get my serving of grits :( but no fear, the waitress made sure I got my corn grits on the side.  The rest of their entree items looked fair, but nothing in particular stood out as a must have.  I settled on a halibut dish.  The appetizers list looked a bit more interesting...   The good: - The chopped salad is a must try (this appetizer has it's own Facebook page for crying out loud!) - The staff.  We were quickly greeted and sat at our table upon arrival, and our drink orders were taken and delivered to the table in record time.  Throughout our meal, my husband harassed the waitress for different selections of wine -- but she was a good sport. He is forever embarrassing me in public, so any spot that can put up with his drunken shenanigans is a win.  The not as good: - Best looking dish, scallops, was not available - My halibut was overcooked - We came in on a Sunday, and the place was half empty... But food still took long time to get cooked. I didn't mind this much, as I was not in a hurry. But if I had been on a schedule, this would surely been annoying - No cappuccino since machine was broken (boo)  Overall, i'd give this place a 3.5.  The chopped salad and friendly service was enough to make me overlook some of their lesser qualities.  I'd like to go back another time and see whether my experience is different--maybe I just caught them on an off night?

No complaints here.  They have all the bases covered for a good breakfast joint: food, service, menu variety, seating.  Also, they have a lunch menu available (though it is primarily a breakfast spot). Since this seems to be the only solid breakfast restaurant in the immediate area, it gets real busy on weekends.

Great food, but somewhat pricey and trendy (read: busy).    Although I love the garden atmosphere-it caters to a certain type of clientele.  This is the type of place you see wedding parties or find a ladies bridge club...  I would not recommend for 'the bros' or a family outing.  Take the girlfriends, sip mimosas, eat the french toast and watch some Scottsdale wives.

Charming little ice cream parlor.  Old style decor and vintage toys in the front of store (fun to browse).  Very affordable place to take the kids for a quick treat! Not as many ice cream flavors as I might like, but the options are good for a smaller selection.  The back patio is a nice little retreat to enjoy your cone.  Plenty of misting and umbrella shade for summer time comfort.

My guilty pleasure. Yes, donuts are absolutely horrible for you (nothing but sugar and fat) but they taste sooooo good (nom). Forget the Krispy Krap, their glaze is so sugary it gives me a toothache/headache and they are overrated in flavor.  Bosa delivers with flavor and a small (regional) chain charm.  I go for the traditional twists, so soft and fun to pull apart in fluffy pieces. But they have a number of great traditional and "fancy" jelly, sprinkle, chunky donuts.  Bonus, drinks with Boba!  I'm not big on coffee, but it tasted ok to me.  Warm and not burnt tasting.  Of course, I've been ruined by S'bux so take it with a grain of salt.   This location is in a nice transitional area on edge of Arcadia.  I really appreciate the drive-thru for quick fixes.  But if you have the time, it is nice to go in an see the whole selection in the display windows. I've never had an issue with speed or service, though i've visited at different hours.

Shattered my iPhone screen and was given a quote to fix at $139 over phone... drive down to store, and was told it is actually $329. Boo. Can't comment on their actual service, cause the hefty price tag scared me away.

Solid food, good atmosphere, and attentive staff. Not much else to add here.   Love this restaurant and it is close to home.  Extra bonus: Great outside patio--it is very generous and well protected from the elements while still being in the fresh air.  The only (possible) negative is that it can get very busy, even on weeknights.  Plan on a short wait.  They are pretty good about seating you as quickly as possible, so I don't get discouraged even when I see a line out the door.

Great food, check.  Convenient location, check.  Friendly local owner, check.  I had been referred to Il Bosco by a fellow yelper some weeks back... And finally decided to venture out for a casual lunch. So happy that I did.   The pizza here is wonderful-fresh ingredients in yummy combinations, straight from a woodfire oven. I tried two different pies, the Caprese salad and their creme brule.  All were well made and the service speedy and friendly.    The store front can be hard to spot (blink and you might miss it), but I actually like the "hole in the wall" feeling of a smaller local business. Take the time to seek this gem out!

More than disappointed... especially after the glowing reviews.   I went in for lunch on a Friday with my family, simply desiring a sit down lunch for my children which didn't involve French fries. The lunch menu was quite simple-only five chicken selections with your choice of various side dishes.    First I ordered the Shwarma... "Sorry, we are out of that" was the reply.  I reviewed the menu options and tried again, asking for the Kebobs. Only to be told, "we are out of that too". The cashier was apologetic and explained that they would be closed tomorrow, however I found it odd that they would not have nearly half of their small selection. I settled on a different chicken plate and was then asked to choose my sides.   I took a look at the sides and asked for rice. "Sorry, we are out of rice". Uh oh, not this again. No rice?  I am seriously considering leaving at this point, but the reviews are so good I decided to stick it out. This time I ask for a side salad. Two guesses as to the reply... yep, out of salad too. I look around the establishment and see several other tables with people-Lord only knows what they are eating (since nothing in the menu is available)! The only options left are fries (exactly what I wanted to avoid) and Israeli salad, so I order that.   My total for two lunch plates and two drinks, a whopping $32.  I couldn't believe it. Definitely more expensive than expected.   Also, when I sat down there were no high chairs to sit my daughter. Oh well, I should have expected that one. The food that came out was not bad, but my experience had already been soured at this point. The food wasn't good enough to redeem the experience.   I honestly can't understand why this place is rated so highly. There are far too many wonderful options in Scottsdale to waste your money here. Sorry.

I stopped in with my family because it was close to the theater. It was only after we sat that I took a glance at the yelp reviews. I don't mind telling you... They scared me , a lot. But I decided to give them a chance.   Service was actually pretty good. We got seated right away and a waitress quickly took or orders. The drinks came out promptly as did the food. I ordered fish and chips to be on the safe side (i mean, who can f-k that one up, Amiright?). The food was fair. It won't win awards but why would you expect it to? It is a sports bar not a place with chefs from La Cordon Bleu.  As an aside, I had my boys check out the bathrooms, since that was a specific complaint. They happily reported a clean toilet bowl.   All in all a positive experience!

Zoolights is a wonderfully unique Phoenix experience for the holidays and is not to be missed. There is a growing light display each year, some kiddie rides (jumpers, sleds, camel rides, etc), plus a few nocturnal animals to view sprinkled around.  This is a wholesome, active and fun way to spend an hour or two with the entire family. It is quickly becoming a Christmas tradition for /this/ family... Unfortunately, it looks like this is the case for many other people across the Valley.  The place is packed!   The main negative points are that a massive number of visitors combined with  narrow, dark pathways can frustrate anyone with a time limit or claustrophobic issues. I'd say there is also room for improvement for the variety in concessions. But these are minor annoyances. Overall, you will not be disappointed.

Great location for hikers and mountain bikers alike.  There are paths easy enough to bring along your kids, dogs, out of shape siblings, etc.   But you can run up some of the more steep/aggressive portions for more of a workout.  This mountain is not as crowded as some of the other Phoenix trails--so it is worth the extra drive.

After a downright disastrous experience with the nearby Sears Portrait Studio (can we say slow and overpriced!)... One of the other dissatisfied patrons recommended Instant Memories as an alternative. And boy am I glad!  This little portrait studio really *gets* it. As a mother of a newborn, the importance of careful scheduling and a comfort zone can not be overstated.  You really appreciate having an understanding and non-distracted staff, it is essential to capture those precious moments on film. The photographers here are considerate, at ease with children (or parents) and very creative. They will work with you to produce a collection of impressive images and they have a variety of print packages to suit your needs.  You will also walk out the door with burned digital copies of your session.  The studio itself is spacious, quiet and comfortable-with several areas for different shooting environments. Prices are reasonable and there is no pressure sales routine when you arrive to pick up your photos.  A+

Quick speedy service at reasonable price.  My toddler dropped my Galaxy S4 one too many times on tile floors.  I knew it was only a matter of time before my screen met its demise.  One drop too many, and I started searching local spots to replace my screen.  This place was a great find!  The prices are not dirt cheap, but still very competitive compared to other places I shopped around.  I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving my phone with just anybody, so I don't mind a bit extra for piece of mind.  After all, we carry our lives around on our phones these days--and I can only sanitize so much (heh).  The guy at the front of the desk was knowledgeable and gave me a few options for upgraded services (without the annoying upcharge hard sell). They are fairly quick and do quality work.  Glad to have a new 'go to' spot for cell repair.

Good first impressions. Nice gangster themed decor, clean, good selection of drinks and food at a moderate price ($10-$15/entree).   I visited during lunch hour on the weekend. It was a completely empty dining room, just one other family who already had their food. We ordered straight away, but still the food came out s l o o o w. I took my kids outside to play (several times) just to kill time. A few patrons walked thru the door and actually left because they couldn't find staff and were unsure if the place was open. That's a bad sign. I only saw one guy working the entire time we were there, a little over an hour. Despite all this we did decide to stay and order.  Good news, the food was very tasty. My burger was juicy and side salad was very fresh with just the right amount of dressing. That was a nice surprise.  Worth the wait? Depends on your schedule. But I enjoyed enough. One curious note: there was only one unisex bathroom. Even with a near empty dining room, I had to wait in line for the toilet. Ugh.

There are two locations I know of and this one is well placed in Downtown Scottsdale. I prefer the original location in Tempe for it's charm, but you can't beat the convenience for either.  Love the food here-simple and delicious.  If you aren't familiar with a Pasty, it's similar to a calzone but the bread is more like a pie crust (think "hot pockets" if they had more filling options and they were homemade by Grandma). The prices are fair, a pasty and a drink will run you about $12-$15. One pasty is more than enough for a full meal - I always leave the restaurant with half of mine to take home and it makes a fine reheated lunch.  I wish they had few more non-alcoholic and signature cocktail drink options, but that isn't a huge deal.  There is a full bar, so you can probably request a tailor made drink.  I am not that creative with drink ordering, so I like to see ideas right there on the menu.  Service and quick seating has never been an issue.  Parking is limited though.

Love this new breakfast spot in town and such a great location. They are a friendly bunch with fast service and good food. And holy moley-ridiculously large portions! Nobody at our table could even put a dent in the plates they were served. My husband and I agreed that we could've shared a plate and still been stuffed. They have a big menu with plenty of options (think Cheesecake Factory). Prices are moderate, but really affordable when you consider the amount of food.  The dining area is a large open cafeteria style with open kitchen-so loud, loud, loud.  For reference, a crying toddler could not penetrate the wall of noise. May not be an issue for some, but worth mentioning.

Super cute, small and trendy restaurant.  It serves up unique entrees and drinks with an upscale "hole-in-the-wall" vibe. The Ramen noodles are probably the best menu item by far.  It may sound boring, but it is a wonderful dish. The broth is flavorful, noodles cooked just right and a good amount of veggies thrown in to make it filling (tad heavy on the mushrooms, but not a deal breaker). They have other entrees that a tasty too, just not as great as the ramen. Other notables: clean bathrooms, service is great, stiff drinks.  My only suggestion would be to improve their sweet selections.  I've been twice and each time the dessert menu was sparse and less than appealing.  I tried their chocolate tart on our last visit, just see if it tasted better than the description... sadly, it was ho-hum.  Oh well, their ambiance and entrees are enough to keep me coming back.  FYI, there is not a lot of seating inside, but plenty of patio seating.

This place is a good casual option for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Kids menu is a little sparse, but they love the Kool-Aid drinks. Regular menu has plenty to choose from, but mostly southern classics - salmon croquettes, mac-n-cheese, fried green beans, and of course Chicken & Waffles.  If you aren't interested in the fried items, they also have salads, burgers, etc.  I've had only one of their lighter options, the egg white omelet, which is extremely tasty.  Seating is plentiful and spacious.  But if you come on weekend, still expect a wait. Classic R&B in the background helps to set the tone.  Saturday afternoons they even have live DJs.

Full disclosure, I came to The Yard with intentions of eating at the Culinary Dropout... But it was a 90 min wait and we had a full party. Barrio could seat us right away (not typically a good sign, but we decided to take a chance).   Well, we shouldn't have been excited to get sat right away, because it was still an hour until we actually got our food. And their menu is severely limited: only half a dozen or so entrees, and cocktail menu is just several different spins on the Margarita. Not terribly complex or difficult to pump out. Plus the place was only half full of guests. We should've got our food much quicker. Very disappointing. Especially since it is Mexican. Mexican food has about four basic ingredients - it should never take this long to prepare.  And then we finally received the food; it didn't improve. Entrees sizes are dismal. I'm talking ridiculously small, for outrageous price ($23 for sliver of skirt steak, GTFO). I'm not one to expect Claim Jumper style portions. But an entree should not be mistaken for an appetizer. The food itself was ok. So they get an extra star for that. But that is where my generosity ends.  So much potential wasted.  To top it all off. You know those cheap Madonna candles that they sell at the dollar store? Yeah, those are littered all around the tables. In the middle of serving, one of our waiters knocked a candle over and spilled hot wax all over our toddler and our food. Yay.  F- this place. Yeah I said it.   Most of the servers were trying to please (except for candle fail incident)... But you can only do so much when the menu,  kitchen and planning blow.  They've only been open few weeks... so maybe they'll improve. Good luck.

Love this place for a quick breakfast. When you are on a timeline, have a large group, and just want a consistent, fast, clean place to eat - this is the spot.  I have been to their location in Old Town Scottsdale many times and am glad that a new location opened in my area.  This location is pretty much the same as the other--same menu, large open dining area, lots of noise and people bustling in and out.  I will admit that the food isn't noteworthy - that's not to say it's bad, just nothing fancy or special.  But the prices are really good! If you are in the mood for something a bit more upscale or alternative, there are plenty of other places... U.S. Egg is more of a classic diner experience.    Side notes: Their staff are always on the ball and pleasant. Also like the other location- parking is a challenge.
