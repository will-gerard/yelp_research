I Found a stray on the side of the road Christmas night. I was on my way to dinner at friends and was worried I would have no place to take her. I Took her to 1st veterinary and was afraid they would tell me they wouldn't take a stray. But quite the contrary. They immediately grabbed a lead and some paperwork and gladly took her into their care. I've worked in veterinary for years and seen the hospitals dismiss strays all the time. 1st veterinary restored my faith in a facility that actually care. I didn't get the names of any of the employees but there were 3 girls working and they all seemed friendly and compassionate. I have no doubt this stray is in good hands!

I shy away from negative reviews as much as possible but this place has been a disappointment on more than 1 occasion. I'm giving 2 stars and if the service wasn't so terrible I'd give more because the food is good.  1st time I went I was greeted and sat by hostess (on the patio). A server never came out for at least 10 minutes. This is unacceptable in the middle of summer in AZ. Water should have been brought by a server or hostess. The service from there continued to be so. Un-attentive to say the least. I mentioned to what I thought was management and a mere apology was given.   Gave another chance yesterday. Server took order without writing anything down. Of course when we got our food, the order was wrong. When we addressed her, she attempted to blame my sister. We were never checked on the entire time. Our waters continued to stay empty. I was at least smart enough to sit inside this time. She seemed very attentive to her to other tables and it was mid day on a Thursday, so not a busy time at all. When she finally did check on us, I just said we were ready for our check. She handed it right over. It was the only one in her apron. What if we were going to order more. Just seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out of there. I'm huge on customer service, as much as I like good food, I pay a premium when going out to have good service and this place just doesn't fit the mold...unfortunately.

After 6 years of loyalty with the same hairdresser and recently spending over $600.00 on my hair, and going lighter mishaps, I finally decided to give a stranger a fair chance. I wasn't surest at this point if I wanted to stay light or go back dark. Selena helped me with my indecisiveness and did the most beautiful ombr√©. She was awesome to sit with. I'll definitely be going back to her!

***PROCEED WITH CAUTION***(MAKE SURE TO READ GOOGLE REVIEWS AND THE FILTERED REVIEWS ON YELP!) ( I don't usually go out of my way to write negative, long winded reviews...)BUT,this was By far one of the most UNPROFESSIONAL places I have ever been to. I had an appointment to bring my sisters dog here. I called to inform them there was an accident on the freeway and I may be a few minutes late. They didn't even have my appointment on the books. After realizing I had an appt on Monday and rescheduled for thurs they told me to go ahead and come in. Someone called me back a few minutes later to inform me of a "late fee" Once I arrived I completed the paperwork and waited in the lobby. There were 2 pre surgery exam appointments before me. After about 25 minutes I was called back. The vet tech was inquiring about my address and stated he used to live by me. He commented on a bar close by and stated it was, and I quote, "the sh#t" ! Although he was friendly I found this to be unprofessional. The Vet came in and took the pulse on the dog. I politely requested not to be charged a late fee as I was only 4 minutes late due to an accident and called ahead. She told me "there's a million excuses as to why someone can be late and she needs to set boundaries and not make exceptions" I stated that 'I understood the purpose of implementing a late fee was to prevent people from interrupting a flow, though I was late there were still 2 appointments in front of me and I caused no interruption and 4 minutes late was a little harsh' She told me 'though I was 4 minutes late I didn't finish my paperwork until 15 minutes after my appt.' She then stated 'clearly I didn't understand how veterinary clinics work'. I informed her I was actually a certified vet tech and have worked under several licensed vets since 2005 and currently run a doggie daycare and boarding facility. I told her was not trying to be confrontational (as it seemed she was) that I just thought the late fee was harsh and found her comments unnecessary. She finally said she will wave the late fee and rolled her eyes. I thanked her and she didn't acknowledge me. She took my dog back, and I thank her again, again she didn't acknowledge me. After leaving I received a call from her a few minutes later. Her words: "I don't believe we should have a relationship and I won't be performing surgery because you don't like me and don't trust me". I said "Ma'am, I never said anything to that nature, you have a job to do and are choosing not to do it based on your feelings towards me, not what you think mine are towards you" She told me to come get my dog or I can leave it there all day and come back before close and she would feed him. QUESTION? If I didn't "trust" her, why would I leave my sisters dog with her all day. Also, any good vet knows that changing a dogs diet could potentially cause diarrhea and vomiting. All in all, I found this experience to be extremely disappointing and unprofessional. After reading other reviews I believe I dodged a huge bullet and am grateful she decided not to perform the surgery. There are way too many caring, kind vets out there to trust any fur babies in her care.

Not much to say, I absolutely love this Fry's. The associates are always kind and professional. They always remind you to use your Fry's card. Produce is always fresh. Prices compared to Albertson's are obvious savings.

Needed immediate services. Someone came within 2 hours. Fixed the problem and at an impressive low cost. Long story short, fast, friendly, affordable. I will be using them for future needs.

I purchased a $15.00 for $30.00 groupon. I went to redeem and purchased a 19.99 bouquet of roses and a 9.99 teddy bear, totaling 29.98. Making it a steal of a deal right? BUT WAIT!!!! They forgot to mention there is a $32.00 "service fee" Thus making my 19.99 roses a 45.00 dollar purchase. 60.00 if I didn't have the groupon. I wish I had read reviews first prior to purchase, that obviously would have been a great help!

Short and simple, this store is always crazy busy, but they do get to you as soon as they can and are pretty good with at least acknowledging you. Especially Julie. She's usually the first one to greet you from 10'feet away when another employee is right in front of you. She's super friendly and helpful. I will continue to shop here. And especially this location!

Not very pleased or impressed with this place. My bf had never had a massage (professionally) before. So for his birthday I surprised him with a couples massage. Before we get called in the room we fill out paperwork. The paperwork ask where the problem areas are and what we would like worked on. Once we were called back, we were again asked. We both were very adamant about just focusing on our backs and no other parts of our body. My masseuse never and I do mean NEVER touched my back. She worked on my shoulders the entire time. It felt painful and there was nothing relaxing, therapeutic or even helpful about this session. I will say my bf's masseuse was a bit better. I will not be returning here not will I recommend. I work way to hard and too much to waste my money like this. I dont understand the concept of paperwork and making request if you have no say. I think it's poor business. The last thing I wanted to do was complain about something on my bf's birthday. :/

This is by far my favorite vet and that's saying a lot being that I have worked with dogs since 2004. Dr Remen is very kind hearted and compassionate. He truly loves animals. He's very integral with his clinic and the way he operates. He's not the vet that runs a bunch of unnecessary test to reach into your pocket book. He gets to the root of the problem, looking out for both you and your pet. I have referred a ton of people to him and they always report to me how much they love him. His staff is consistent and amazing as well! I would highly recommend desert tails!!

Just ate here for the first time this mothers day. The server was knowledgeable, suggestive and friendly. The place is super clean. The food was great! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was the portion sizes did not make up for the pricing.

LOVE this salon! I'm shocked to see such bad reviews. I came across this place while shopping San Tan Village. It's not convenient to my house (I live in East Mesa) but their prices are very competitive and my wait time has always been short. They do a great job on shaping the way you desire and I haven't had any issues with nails breaking or peeling. I'm not one for pedis (I'm ticklish)  , but the massage chairs look very nice. The gentlemen, I believe he may be the manager, always talks to you while doing your nails. He doesn't cross talk or speak in a language you may not understand. I keep coming back!

I continue to use this specific location. They are privately owned and extremely friendly. Initially I went to the location on tatum and thunderbird. The gentlemen working repeated that they were very busy seeming as though he wanted me to say never mind I'll go somewhere else. Which is what brought me to this location. The gentlemen behind the counter were extremely friendly and made my visits fun by being personable and jokesters. Their service was fast and they didn't come out with a list of "other things" wrong with your car. 5 STARS for fast, friendly, honest service!

There is no justification in the service I received. I went to meet a couple of friends the Friday before last. They happen to run into a friend of theirs. That gentlemen ordered some shots, drinks and dinner. I heard him tell the bartender it was on his boss's tab. A while later they tried to get him to pay his tab. He said "I told you it was on my boss's tab" Long story short, his boss had left and they never put it on his tab. Some time goes by, the manager walks over to myself and the gentleman I was sitting with. He asked if we knew this other man. The gentleman I was with says he knew him a little, I stated I've never met him before. The manager asked if we can get him to pay his tab. (I personally find this to be extremely tacky and unprofessional) We did not come here with this man, it is not our responsibility). I've bartended in Scottsdale and Vegas. It is the server/bartenders responsibility  to get the credit card when starting a tab. After all, they did make sure to get mine. The manager stated it was just 1 drink ('what's the big deal'?) I clarified with him that it was just one drink? Again he stated yes. I didn't want to deal with trying to get some man I don't know to pay his tab and I didn't enjoy my evening being interrupted by this nonsense, so I said "If it's just one drink, put it on my tab" (which I shouldn't have to do). The manager shook my hand and said thank you.  30 min later I closed out my tab. Keep in mind all I had was 2 drinks and bought my friend a drink. My tab was $62.00!!! The bartender ended up putting that mans entire tab on mine. I called her over and I told her I found that to be very sneaky and disrespectful. She stated I said I would pay for the whole thing. I stated that was incorrect, she continued to argue with me. Why are we arguing? This is not my friend nor my tab. There is NOTHING to argue about.   She finally went to speak to the manager. After about 10 minutes, she comes back has me sign a voided sales receipt for the 62.00. She never apologizes and then runs my card for my drinks plus one of his. I understand I said I would pay for this mans drink, but being that he had an entire tab it seems desperate to have a complete stranger pay for 1 of his drinks just to minimize how much of his tab they'll have to eat. Every bar has a spill/comp tab. They shouldn't make anybody else responsible for this...On top of the unprofessionalism, arguing, lack of apology, and wait time to get this solved. As a person who runs a business myself, if my employees neglect to follow protocol (ie; neglect to obtain credit card in this case,) I eat the cost. I most certainly wouldn't have another paying customer cover it.  To make matters worse, myself and a friend (who frequents this establishment) went in to talk to a manager about this incident. I gave the MOD my business card and have yet to hear back from anyone. It has been 10 days. I never yelp about a place without giving the manager an opportunity to fix it...so there you have it folks... They lack professionalism big time in this place.

Just moved to this side of town and aside from this store having all the essentials and "beyond" the customer service is outstanding! Mike and Conner were super friendly and helpful and Tela was super patient with my returns and needs. Looking forward to more shopping here!

I'm very impressed with Topaz Veterinary Clinic, particularly Dr. Berthiaume. I manage a Doggie Daycare and boarding facility in Scottsdale and we have a daycare pup that's been coming for daycare. He recently had a mass removal at Topaz Veterinary Clinic. I noticed the incision was slightly irritated and called Topaz Veterinary Clinic to inquire about his history so I may transport him to a closer clinic. Dr. Berthiaume, ended up calling me back and immediately drove to our facility so that he may treat the patient himself. He wasn't only pleasant and friendly, he also seemed to be very knowledgeable to the background of the patient as well as his siblings. It's not always easy to find a Veterinarian who genuinely cares. I would definitely recommend!

My gf paid 1500 for a table for 12. When we arrived we waited outside in the cold for at least 20 minutes. We were chaperoned to a table that seats 6 people. How do you pay for 12 and get seated for 6?!?! The service was horrible! We were constantly out of ice. I asked a server for a food menu and she never came back. I then went on a hike to find another server. I told her I asked for a menu and never received one. She said "ok" and walked away. Incredibly rude! Needless to say I never got to eat. Oh and the kicker?! In her total was 2 bottles of champagne. NEVER received!!! How do you advertise champagne for the new year. Charge for it and never deliver. UNACCEPTABLE! I will never return to this poorly run establishment!

For some unknown reason I've had lower to mid back pain for 3 years. About 6 months ago the pain become more consistent (as in daily) scaling between and 8-10 on the pain scale. I've been to multiple specialist who perform radiographs and (never successfully finding anything) and then gladly writing me a prescription for pain meds and taking my copay along withy billing my insurance.  In January I was so desperate for relief I started doing more research. I came across Pains Stop. Was apprehensive at first because of my naivety to chiropractic work. Needless to say, but it needs to be said ;)...my pain is progressively getting better. If I feel pain at all, it is usually at a 2 and I haven't had to take a pill in over a month. Dr Mitch and his team are extremely professional, kind, efficient and most importantly compassionate to your pain. I highly recommend Pain stop as well as this location!!

Really, really like this place!Arrived around 10am and the place was packed. Opted to sit outside to get the full experience. There was a little bit of a wait, but the manager Gino checked on us several times. He's extremely efficient, friendly and animated. He definitely adds to the experience! I ordered the lox, bagels and cream cheese while my bf ordered the bird omelette. Both were great and worth the wait. Service was fast. The only con was our server. She was nice but I never even got her name. She took our order,checked on us once and that was it. She was also busy so I still gave 5 stars! And most importantly can't forget pet friendly!!!

Definitely money well spent! Got my teeth whitened yesterday. Customer service was great! Both Nicoles were extremely nice. The procedure was pretty simple. It takes an hour, so bring your headphones (however they did have iphone ones for me :) ). Most importantly it really works. I was a 3 or 4 shade of yellow, and I went down several shades to a -2 which was the second whitest. Overall great experience!

Making a last minute drive to vegas. Noticed my car was in desperate need of new tires for such a drive. Josh took care of me immediately. The tires I wanted weren't in stock. He ordered them and had them delivered and placed on my car all today. Very satisfied customer and will continue to buy my tires here in the future!

UNSATISFACTORY! I really aim to help businesses with positive reviews so if I write a negative, then I've already dealt with upper management and became even more dissatisfied! The only reason I'm giving this clinic 2 stars is because I REALLY like the Dr. That aside, the staff is incredibly rude with terrible customer service. I think it's really unfortunate when the staffs attitude reflect poorly onto the business. I went last year and the girls were incredibly rude and unhelpful. I ignored them and didn't complain. I rescheduled my yearly again this year because I liked the Dr. But this year they were even worse. I won't go into detail because I don't want to spend that much time typing. I also won't be going back. I found another Dr whom I love and because of their customer service I will continue to go for years to come! I'm not going to tell you not to go here because the Dr really is great, but make sure you're wearing your patience hat that day and don't say I didn't warn you!

Love this place. I'm new to the vape world...As a business owner, Im huge on customer service. I will not give my business to a company that doesn't value me a customer. With that being said I have been to multiple vape stores. This one by far is my favorite. Caleb helped me the first time and knows the flavors like the back of his hand. His store was busy and he was able to multi task and help everyone. I went back the other night and Eli and Denn were extremely nice and helpful. My bf and I ended up staying a while and chatting just because the environment is so laid back and friendly. My fave feature about butt out is that you can test the flavors first. I think this is genius and don't understand why other locations don't do this! Needless to say, this is my shop!

To put it simply, I love this place! Great food, and very clean environment. After reading the other reviews, I'm not sure what the big deal is about ordering your food standing vs. sitting. If anything you're not sitting at the table waiting for a server to come by, and they do still service your table with a smile. My fave dish is the "southwest burrito" yum! The owner Clay is always involved and eager to make sure food goes out fresh and hot! And my favorite thing about scramble, is their dog friendly patio! It's hard enough to find a great breakfast joint let alone a dog friendly restaurant. Combine the 2 and you've got scramble...enjoy!

Amazing customer service. Showed up a quarter passed closing but Patty opened the doors for me and my BF. She spent about 45 min after closing with us. Very friendly and knowledgable. Way out of my way but because of the service, we will def be back :)
