Definately a diamond in the rough.  From first impression it seems like what am I doing eating at someone's house???  The service is slow and overpriced...however the food is really that good.  They serve asian fusion type food.  The pot stickers & hot & sour soup are excellent appetizers.  The main dishes are a bit eclectic but are tastey.  And the after dinner fortune cookie type things are very good.

This place has grown on me over the years...I am officially addicted to the bread and butter.  The dishes vary, from 1 star to 6 star...yes 6.  So depending on what you order you may or may not like it...however I do enjoy trying out new dishes.  Till next time keep up the good work.  Service is always great.

I ate here for lunch today...am I missing something from all the rave reviews...  I had the Chicken Lo Mein, the quality of the chicken and lo mein noodles is cheap, the hot & sour soup was okay but nothing grand, fried rice was plain, and the egg rolls weren't spectacular.  My dining companions had general's chicken, and mongolian beef...and they didn't seem to like their meal ither.  Over all it was a 1 star, but the 2nd star for the price and the soup.

"BLAND" is my one word summary  1) vegetable dumplings...i'd say it was frozen then thawed out and tasted like pot stickers you'd get anywhere...the one's at Fate now those were good. (2 stars)  2) hot & sour soup was huge which is usually a good thing...but useless if it doesn't taste hot & sour at all...all I tasted was sweet & more sweet soup. (1 stars)  3) chicken vindaloo (what was I thinking ordering and indian dish at a chinese place?)  anyways probably the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life and tasted absolutely nothing like chicken vindaloo. (0 stars)  4) wife had vegetable fried rice...i think they forgot that we ordered everything spicy...had no flavor and i think they even forgot the soy sauce to make it fried rice (1 star)  on a positive note my wife did like the free salad and wonton chips and the service was good.  overall I wouldn't give this place another try even with all the stellar reviews.

Fusion?  I don't think so. Its a Pan-Asian - Pacific Rim place...  Is it the best thai?...no but its good Is it the best chinese?...no but its good is it the best vietnamese?...no but its ok Is it the best sushi?...no but its ok  it has nice decor, above average food, great selection, typical asian service standards.  its good if your party can't decide on any specific type of asian cuisine

Oreganoes is fantastic, the pizza is alot better than main stream pizza and hole in the wall places.    The wings of fire is probably the best tasting in town.  the food portions are massive and reasonably priced.  there is always a wait for lunch or dinner so its a great place to go for off hour eating.  the pizzuki is standard issue, but i'm not really a desert person so I can't say if its good or bad.

Probably the best pizza in Tempe.  Place is small and hidden but a true find.  The staff is friendly too with great service.  The food taste much better when it is dine in...for some reason takeout doesn't taste the same...

Ok YAROPB (yet another review of pizzeria bianco)  This place is just ok...nothing to brag about, and definately not worth the 2-4 hour wait.  6pm...arrived...put a table for 4 on the list  7pm...hunger set in we ate cheese and had a beer next door...the cheese is by far the worst tasting cheese ever.  (but i am no fine cheese connoisseur)...beer was great  8pm...did nothing...still hungry...played games 8 games of solitare and bubble breaker on cell phone  9pm...sat and placed an order for 4 different pizzas  9:45pm...took the first bite and thought there is nothing special about it...took a second bit and said the freshness of the ingredients was grand.  The quality of ingredients were really good.  The crust burnt, the dough tasted nothing more than naan at an indian restaurant cooked in a clay oven.  Sauce fresh tasting...cheese far better than the shit next door.  10pm...got bored of the pizzas decided to try others...sadly same effect.  all in all this place is okay, is it worth 3 hours...NO.  is it better than little ceasar's YES...  personally BJ's Pizza and Brewery, Nello's, Oregano's, Grimaldi's, and especially Spinato's is far better, and you have less of a wait at any of these places...  why the long wait then?  cause the place is tiny, maybe 25 seats, and an hour and a half to two hours dining time...plus media hype  why the good reviews?  cause after 4 hours of hunger and or boozing even taco bell's mexican pizza would be the best thing you ever tasted that night.  Needless to say Jack Bauer does more in 4 hours...and this is 4.5 hours I will never get back.

The salsa is probably the only reason to go here, the service was pretty good too, lot of water and chips refills.  The food is mediocre I would say but alot better than places that end in "tos".  I go back just for the salsa and the fact that pretty much every mexican food place in AZ is not that good at all, so Los Dos wins.

Fantastic burgers, fantastic service...mixed fries with ketchup & aioli sauce is a must...   I wish they had a larger menu selection however what they do offer they do it well...  if in phx this is a must eat at lunch spot or late night grub.

Sorry I know this place is popular...just not a fan for several reasons.  1) No hot subs...i'm just not a fan of cold sandwiches 2) Learned what baguettes are...hard bread = stale bread to me 3) Cash only...had to use ATM with atm & bank fees  Lemonaid is good, could only eat half my ham & cheese sandwich...  went across the street to eat a bigmac which i would also give 2 stars for...

The juices were fantastic like last time.  tostada chips and guac were fantastic.  I ordered lamb again...this time the smell was great and tasted good.  The rice with frozen veggies were still wierd considering its an expensive dish.  service was also great...will come back here again to try other things.

Definitely a great Sunday brunch spot...the bad part is they usually have an hour wait at 10am when I went.   The French Toast is the best I ever had...its not Texas sized toast its more like Alaska sized cinnamon toast.  My only real downside from being a 5 star place is a plate of French Toast is filling however i would have probably preffered 2 toast instead of 3 and it comes with a small 2 egg omlette...now that would be a perfect combo.  or even a smaller omlette, a french toast and some bacon or sausage.  They should add those kinds of deals for like 8.99 or 9.99.  Definately better than AZ Bread, Crackers...and the franchises like Good Egg, Denny's, IHOP, Waffle House...  I'm still waiting to try matt's big breakfast...

This place is a hole in the wall that is damn good...the red salsa is spicy and flavorful...when I went the carne quality was over cooked it was 4pm...I'm thinking the food is 5 star if you go at noon...I hope.  Okay I went a couple of days later and it was 1pm..the carne asada was fresher but still a bit cheap in quality.  This is definately one of my favorites for a burrito or tacos

I was in a rush, but wasn't in the mood for fast food.  Saw this place and decided to try it out.  I walked in and its a buffet setup, I asked if I can do a to-go and how much.  Man says yes and $10, I said sure set me up.  Hands me a styrofoam container, and I asked him I can put whatever I want, he said yes.    Went to the line, and what a disappointment, the only thing that looked appetizing was vegetable biryani and idli.  So I put a little bit of rice and took 5 idlis...plates only half full.  I asked if they would bring out some more idli.  They said yes.  Shortly they brought out some more to restock the buffet.  I grabbed 5 more...now my plate is full.  And I am on my way right?  Wrong! the manager or owner stops me and says I'm sorry but I'm going to have to charge you extra for the idlis.  I'm baffled...he explains that buffet takeout is for a variety only and not just one thing.  I'm baffled...I ask him so if I dine in, and I take a plate of only one thing and maybe the second time I get the same thing you would charge me twice?  He says no, that's dine in though.  I'm baffled at the logic here...so I went along and says what are you going to charge me...he says $9...i'm baffled $19 for 1 plate of vegetarian food!  I can understand a premium steak but rice cakes (idlis)...unreal.  I was tempted to just leave the plate there and show him the bird, but I already commited to $10 already...and I was in a hurry and starving...so I bit the bullet and paid $9 more.  NEVER again will I give this place my business...and the food wasn't even that good...it's rice cakes for god sake.

This is a nice place to take a date to or a girls night out.  The drinks were potent but tastey.  The food was full of flavor & the service was awesome.  All in all I would go back...I would give it 5 stars but was turned off by the prices vs the portion of food you get.  Great for chics with small waste lines.

5 Stars - Probably one of the best BBQ in the valley...yes even better than Joe's BBQ...the cornbread and butter makes my mouth salivate...nowhere else does cornbread taste so good.  The spicy BBQ sauce is the best in the valley.  The meat quality is good, the BBQ sauce is what makes this place 5 stars.  0 Stars - Problem is it is CLOSED forever.  spot is available for lease.

I love the Scilian Pizza its full of flavor, the spicy spagetti is fantastic.  The owners are Italian and have a thick accent, the place is definatly casual and I have no problem going in with some bball shorts and a tshirt unlike most italian places.  the service is always friendly and fast...definatly a must eat at establishment when your looking for some great italian food but low key.

It's now called Pho Dalat instead of Pho Sapa... I had the Lemon Grass Chicken and it is by far the best I have ever tasted.  The spice level is somwhat weird, it's 1 through 5 and a 9...I get the 9 and it is still full of flavor and doesn't taste like all chilli sauce.  The decor is relaxing, unlike typical mom and pop places where I feel a bit uneasy, the selection is great you can tell them to cook it anyway you like, with beef or veggie etc., the price is resonable.   The service is a bit slow, but I think that is the industy standard as far as asian cuisine goes.

CLOSED  Looks like another one bites the dust...  great location, great prices, good portions, good service but HORRIBLE food maybe cause its a Canadian company...next time when the sign says "Made in Japan"...maybe the food or company should actually come from there.

Red and Green salsa was good, Guacamole was also good, taco's were ok, margaritas were ok nothing special.  over priced and crappy service even when there is only 2 other tables in the whole restaurant.

Same red/white colors as in-n-out however twice the price and half the flavor...very disappointing and i'm not even a fan of in-n-out.  For that kind of pricing model, you are better off going to Delux, Red Robin, Blu Burger or actually any restaurant or dive bar and you will get a better burger for the same price.

Asian Kitchen is a nice little place that serves pcific rim cuisine...the decor is nice and small.   I had the drunken chicken & shrimp...it was delicious and full of flavor.  As far as asian food goes this is a hidden gem and far supirior to mom & pop places and they typical chinese buffet.  One star less since I wish they had a larger menu selection.
