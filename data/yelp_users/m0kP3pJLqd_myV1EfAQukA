Best jukebox box on this side of town.  I used to just come for breakfast but turns out its a great late night too.

Holy pushy.  It took 30 sec and my oil change and free car wash was up over. 150 bucks when I slowed him down he walked away. Luckily one of the car wash guys came over and took care of me and was very helpful.  As I'm sitting hear watching the car wash guys they seem to be doing a great job as well.  As one of the other revise says you definetly need to come here knowing what service you need or they will get you for more.

Daves is a great little dive bar.  The bar staff is friendly but also willing to give you a wise ass when it's appropriate.   The prices are always reasonable and you will never complain about a weak cocktail.
