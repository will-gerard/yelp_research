My air went out when I went on vacation and had them come and take a look. There service was amazing and detailed and everything was explained. I felt in very good hands. In turn I had to replace my unit. Did my research and DTD provide the great service at a fair price.

This place recently open up near me and I thought I would give it try. Looking at some of the reviews I thought I be in for a pretty good experience. Unfortunately it was just mediocre. I got two Dogs and here were what I found to be issues that could not be over looked.   First, both hot dogs were not even hot, wasn't even warm bordering on hot, they were just slightly warm. Not even sure how that is possible with the dogs coming straight off the grill.   Second, i decided to get a snapper as they are a rare find and was excited to see on the menu. Now i know they state spiral cut hot dog, but by spiral cutting a snapper you have ruined the most most important part of a snapper hot dog which is that snap when you bite into it.   Third the Chili Dog, I don't want to say this because I have no proof but what my taste buds tell me. I swear thought; that is "hormel" chili they put on the dog. Either that or they are using so much bland chili powder in there chili that the taste is mimicking Hormel flavor. It completely run the dog for me and could not finish. At least the chili was hot.  For the Pros,  The Staff was super friendly and the buns were OK.  I don't think i could recommend this place.
