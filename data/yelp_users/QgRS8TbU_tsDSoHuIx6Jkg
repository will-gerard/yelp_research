Me gusta!!! I love Mexican food and while visiting Madison this past week we actually came here twice in 10 days. The queso dip was delicious as well as our entrees. The price for the food is cheap (we were only here for lunch menu). And they came out in really good time!   The only complaint I have is the prices for margaritas - $10 and it didn't taste like a drop of tequila was in it :( other than that we will definitely be coming back, without ordering the margaritas.

Just moved to Arizona recently and have yet to check out any of the museums, so I decided to try out the science museum today. Nothing impressive.   I'm from Toledo, Ohio which is MUCH smaller than Phoenix and we have a wonderful science center/museum so I was really excited to see how great a huge city like Phoenix's science center was. But boy was I wrong. It's pretty small for what I was expecting, the price is OK, but there's just not much to do. They obviously tried very hard but a lot of things were broken, and there's only about 3 real activities per area. Which seems huge but not really considering the size of Phoenix. Just overall blah :(  Sadly disappointed and I will definitely not be returning.

ULTA is heaven. Especially this one. It had everything in stock that I saw, the workers were all very nice & helpful but not too overbearing. And the eye brow station is the best to go to. My eyebrows look great after going here. Definitely will be going back for all my makeup & hair products as well as for my eyebrows!

The food was great but our waiter and the ambiance was horrible... Our waiter forgot half our drinks, after we asked twice. We we finally got our drinks they tasted horrible. He then disappeared for 18 minutes - we timed it as a joke but then we were actually getting pissed. Finally, there were only five tables in the inside and they sat us all right next to each other crammed it. Dumb. Go 15 minutes north to Nori Sushi in north scottsdale, much better!

Love the melting pot! Have been a few times and it's just as great every time. It's the perfect restaurant for a romantic night out. Yes, it is pricey but it's so unique and taste great that it's worth it! Two people is about $200, but the food is delicious and we get three courses & drinks. The servers have all been amazing and it's always clean.

I have been here a few times & had great service the first time and the food was awesome. Second time it was okay service but the food didn't taste anything like it did the first time, and I got the same thing. It was crazy packed the second time we went and the wait was 45 minutes. Which I didn't mind, the bartenders were on point & got you a drink as soon as you got up to the bar. But the hostess who sat us had no personality, didn't greet us, say hello or anything. She put the menus down & walked away. It was so awkward. And like I said above the food wasn't as good. Was disappointed the second time around.

I could write a whole book about why this place is so amazing and 5 star worthy. The margaritas and tacos were delicious and full of flavor. The server next to us, his name was RJ or JR, was AMAZING. Our server was good but he helped the table next to us and he did great with the young kids at the table and super excited and really enjoyed his job, it seems! But Michael, the manager, is what won us over. I saw an OSU license plate hanging up (Ohio girl here) so I got super excited & he told us all about his football traditions every year and how he keeps the national champions up on the wall. Even though he's a Nebraska fan, he was great, friendly and an attentive manager. We will definitely be back for more margaritas and friendly ambience!

Come to this four peaks pretty often and have always had amazing service until two weeks ago. I don't know what the deal was but our server was HORRIBLE. Our group all ordered at the same time but our food all came out in 20 minute increments. It was not that busy, it was a Tuesday night and it took two hours once we were seated to get our drinks and food. Absolutely ridiculous, and our waitress forgot multiple things we asked for like new drinks, sides of ranch/ketchup, etc. very disappointed. When we go back I will request not to sit in her section.

Came here for an early lunch one day since its right up the road from my house and I was starving! I had the Caesar wrap with tater tots and they were both SO good! The only reason I'm not giving it 5/5 is because we were the only table outside and there was only 3 tables inside, with that being said - our service was not so good. We will be back though hoping for better service!

Yogurtology is one of the best yogurt places I've been to, flavor wise. It's always pretty clean & they change up the flavors a lot, which is nice and I have yet to get one I didn't like. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because of the staff. It's truly a hit or miss with them. Sometimes my boyfriend & I go in and are greeted with a hello and a cheerful goodbye. Yet other days, the employees don't even look up from the cash register or muster up a goodbye. I understand they're teenagers but haven't they been taught customer service manners or manners in general. But seating outside is never a problem, if there isn't a table open there's a lot of benches nearby. Great location!

I live nearby and love coming here! It has so many trails, all with different views. I'm obsessed. They have bathrooms, water fountains & plenty of markers on the trails that it's nearly impossible to get lost. It's definitely heavily populated but not enough that it takes away from the experience. Depending on what trail you hike it could be rigorous but not too difficult. Just overall a great place to hike & watch the sunset!

Just got done hiking toms thumb trail a few hours ago for the first time. So beautiful, but challenging! Takes around two hours for the whole thing round trip, but definitely rewarding once you get to the top. Clearly marked trails, which was nice too. About every half mile there was a sign telling you how much longer left & which direction to go for each trail. Doesn't have water at the main trail head but has restrooms & maps! Great for moderate hikers!

I am not from Madison but I travel here pretty frequently and have absolutely loved all the restaurants to date... Until I came to graze. Mind you, I'm a clean eater; I love clean, home grown food - which graze offers. There were three of us that went to brunch today and all of our entrees were HORRIBLE :( First off when we got there the host gave us our water and said a server would be by soon. 15 minutes later and no one came by so we asked the host about it and they actually comped us our app for the wait. Awesome, but that's where the greatness ends.. The burrito and burgers were so terrible; we ended up eating a few bites, paid, left and ate somewhere else.   We will definitely not be back.

My family and I have been to this restaurant before and enjoyed it so we came back again tonight and it was god awful. The only reason it has two stars is because our poor waiter was so nice and obviously felt bad for us and we got our apps and one meal on the house.   First off our reservation was for 7 pm - we didn't get seated until 7:20, even though we were all there on time.   Secondly, our drinks were so weak. I've been a bartender, I know what a drink should taste like. I'm not an expert but Jesus Christ I can tell when there's no booze in a drink.  Third - one of our pasta dishes wasn't cooked AT ALL. Also this was 9:00 pm by the time we got our food, even though there was only 10 other tables there at this time. So they sent that dish back and it took 20 minutes to "re-cook" it. Then it wasn't even good!   I don't know what was going on tonight but the manager was in the kitchen the whole time so obviously shit was going down. There are plenty of other restaurants in kierland commons to go to that's waaaayyyy better.

Came here for a business lunch with my boss a few weeks back and wasn't looking forward to seeing that I don't eat cheeseburgers and we couldn't drink. I was wrong though. Their menu is huge - I got a turkey burger and it was delicious. I loved it. Their drink selection is huge and had everything imaginable on it. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is a bit small, love outside seating but this place doesn't offer a ton of it.

Love, love, LOVE SMG. My boyfriend & I live nearby and we go to the movies a lot. Few times a month and we haven't been to another movie theatre since we've discovered SMG a few months ago. The food is great, the drinks aren't as strong as most bars or other restaurants but still are good. The chairs are amazing! So big and comfy! If you choose a huge leather chair you can put up the arm rest between you and your partners, creating a couch. The tickets cost just as much as others, so why not choose a movie theatre that serves food & drinks while watching a great movie?!

Truly the best restaurant i've been to thus far since moving out to AZ two months ago. I got the pulled pork sandwich & it was not a normal pulled pork. The flavoring/sauce was SO GOOD. And the portions are huge! My boyfriend got the barbecue burger and he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had.  The decor, music, & overall vibe was what really got me hooked though. I'm into the whole surfing/beach life so finding a place like this in the middle of the desert is beyond perfect. I will definitely be back!

This place is awesome! My boyfriend & I had never been to a conveyer belt sushi place so we asked how it works (ordering, cost, etc.) and they were more than helpful! The sushi was great, too. Small portions but we were full with 7 or 8 plates and it only cost $15. It was amazing.  Only complaint I have is that they are highly understaffed. We didn't get a refill on drinks because the poor waitress was running around doing everything by herself; hostess, waitress, busser, cashier. But other than that it was great!

The price and closeness to the strip are the only things good about this place - oh and the fact that there's a liquor store and restaurant right beside it.   If you don't mind the 10 homeless people who live in front of the hotel at night and nasty, dirty carpets then this is the place for you! One person in our room had white socks and after an hour in the room the bottom of his socks were completely black.   We were only in the room for a total of 10 hours the whole weekend, to sleep, so that's the only reason we stayed there. If you're looking to hang out and spend the majority of your time at your hotel while in Vegas, pay the extra $40 a night and stay at one of the main hotels on the strip cus this place doesn't have much going for it!

Shayna is AMAZING.   I got the serenity facial and they massage your shoulders, hands & feet along with your facial. Shayna was so nice, very knowledgable about a lot of products and what I should use based on my skin texture.

DO NOT GO HERE. This place is an absolute wreck. Overpriced drinks, Food is decent at best, the waitresses & waiters are just hot messes. I don't know if they're told to dress like they do, but the girls at hooters wear more clothes than these girls do. Seating is a joke, the noise inside is horrible, you can't even hear the people at your table. We actually got our food to go after sitting there for an hour because we couldn't take it anymore. So many better bars in the area to check out instead. Save yourself the hassle!

My boyfriend & I tried this place today out on a whim because it seemed everywhere else was closed.. But I am so glad we did. I got the shrimp po boy and it was one of the best I've ever had, as well as the side of asparagus. We will definitely be back thanks to the great tasting food, reasonable prices and the whole ambiance of the place!

I really don't see why the reviews on here are so low. I go to this particular BWW's at least once a week, if not more, because of the great service and food. Tonight They were packed but we got our food and drinks at a normal rate. But the greatest part was Brylee! She was the guest experience person tonight & she was on top of her shit. Some douche kabob kept yelling for the TV that multiple tables (mine included) to be switched to hockey, although we were watching football. So they change it to hockey, we get pissed and ask them to change it back. This douche is yelling at us, the bartenders & waitresses. But Brylee went around to each table and asked what we wanted to watch & what TVs it would be on. She was great & it was awesome the bdubs has someone like her come around to make sure everyone has their game on.

Meh. Nothing special. Typical overcrowded sports bar near a campus. The hostess was rude, took forever to get a drink, super loud & if you sit outside there's a 99% chance you're going to get sprayed by their sprinklers no matter where you sit. Plenty of other great bars on mill to check out. I'd go here again if it was a last resort and all other bars were closed.

My FAVORITE place in Scottsdale. Great atmosphere, food and amazing booze selection. I come here at least once a week since moving here 7 months ago.  The outdoor patio is amazing, I have yet to sit inside. They allow dogs & even bring bones and water for them. Their menu is huge; they have everything from tacos, to burgers and their salads are so good.  Everyone I've brought here also loves it. I highly recommend the steak fries for an appetizer and the tacos or grilled cheese!

I have lived in scottsdale for 5 months now and have yet to find a sushi place I loved.. Until I found nori & it's right down the road from me!   The portions are huge and everything taste fresh & great! The waitress was knowledgable on everything & her recommendations were spot on.   Only reason I gave it a four star because the price was a bit much, but not horrible. We will definitely be back!

Tried this place last night & would have rather gone to McDonald's, and I never eat fast food. Our waitress took forever; for drinks, appetizers and food. Then the food comes out... Two of our orders tasted like crap; the grilled cheese and the veggie sandwich - which we got because the waitress suggested it. The other two said theirs was decent but they have had better. It took over an hour & a half for the whole dinner when the place was empty! Maybe 5 other tables in the dining room and our waitress only had 1 other table so not sure why she took so long. The only thing that saved it was the decor inside.

Being from the Midwest and spending a lot of time in Wisconsin, I may be bias, but I LOOVE noodles & co and so glad they finally opened up a branch out here in Arizona. They obviously have all noodle dishes, with various meats to add to your dish. My favorite is the buttered noodles but the Wisconsin Mac & cheese is the bomb.com and their rice Krispy treats are heaven in your mouth. I know it's scary to try new things but you will not regret the deliciousness that is noodles & co!
