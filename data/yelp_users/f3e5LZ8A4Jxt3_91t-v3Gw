Really good sushi spot! The inside is nicely decorated with a pleasant atmosphere. We got the Sekai roll and tempura appetizer which was so delicious!! They also bring you a hot towel to cleanse your hands as well as a bowl of warm miso soup. We were in and out in good time after a whole day of moving and this was the perfect way to end the day! Highly recommend trying it at least once.

I've been here at least a dozen times and they never fail at fast service and good coffee! They are usually pretty friendly too. The iced White Russian is the only one I've ever tried because it's that good! It is perfectly sweet with a delicious espresso taste and surprisingly refreshing. Sometimes I wish they had a larger size option to further feed my addiction  :P

Cute little bagel shop! They have free wifi, delicious bagels, good lattes and frozen coffee drinks and they make their own cream cheese too. The asiago bagel with jalape√±o cream cheese is really yummy! And my daughter loves the chocolate chip bagels. It always has customers and it seems to do good business. Staff is friendly and the outdoor patio has comfy chairs and tables to enjoy your food outside.  Oh and they also have sandwiches and breakfast bagels for those looking for more. Would definitely recommend!

I was a bit thrown off by the barbershop in front of the coffee shop as I was greeted by 4 ruggedly handsome guys lol. The coffee is absolutely fantastic though! I got a vanilla latte and was very happy with the quality and taste. They charge a lot less than most coffee shops and I paid less than $3 for my small latte! The Barista surfer looking dude was VERY nice and patient. I would 100% recommend this place if you are a hardened black coffee drinker or sweet latte lover. My new favorite spot!

I love wildflower but today I went in for a bagel and muffin to go. It took them over 10 minutes to make ( they were not that busy) and it was totally charred when I opened the bag at home.

The food here is fantastic. It reminds me of a grown up hot pocket ( but not gross lol). I've had both the vegetarian and meaty pasties and they are awesome! Good fresh made lemonade and iced tea too. If you like meatless I would highly recommend the Veggie Rosemary Chicken pasty with mustard sauce, my favorite!

I've been going here for about 4 years now so I feel my review actually has a fair amount of experience here. The BIGGEST turn off is the people. If you are a hipster or snob you will fit right in! Never once in all the time I have come here has any of the staff been friendly or helpful. First, You work in a customer service oriented industry so stop moaning about how hard it is living in your parents basement because they tell you to turn down your indie records and slap a smile on your face! Second, if I'm paying $5 for a coffee it better be good service and good coffee. It's not that hard to grasp. Now on to the coffee.. It is good coffee but certainly not the best phoenix has to offer . Mocha and their chai is the best on the menu imo. It's worth at least one visit  because it's a great area to walk around and is in a funky shop inside of a historic house so there's lots of character all around. The Crepes they offer are very good if you're hungry as well as some of their fresh baked pastries. All in all Jobot is a decent coffee shop but like I said the staff and "local crowd" that hangs there is far from enjoyable.

Terrible company!! They don't care about the  person at all. We got screwed out of our dream home twice and it turned our home search into a nightmare! If this review isn't enough to deter you, find out for yourself! But you've been warned... Update: the owner of the business thinks threats are good for business when he wrote me a message stating:  "If you do not we will forward to both yelp and our legal department for review and appropriate action.  Please remove this post immediately if you cannot provide the applicable facts you are stating."

I've gone here a few times because it's right across the street from my school. Their tuna sandwich is good, bialys are yummy, coffee is decent, breakfast sandwich yummy but their "oatmeal our way" is not my fave. I couldn't finish it, it was so bland because it's made with quinoa and steamed milk and pears/apples and not much else excitement goes into it. If they put berries in it that would help sweeten it up but they didn't quite nail this creation on the head. Other than that it's a reasonably priced yummy eatery with a drive thru!

Great coffee shop minutes from home! Be very aware that this place focuses on very sweet coffee drinks, which are delicious but may not be for everyone. Even though i go there often they don't really make me feel welcome, but oh well. They do a punch card and their drinks cure my coffee and sweet tooth cravings! Would definitely recommend :)

I had to edit my original review after my experience today. I went to the drive thru and ordered a iced flavored latte. After the guy asked multiple times for me to repeat the size, iced/hot I get my drink delivered to me as a hot latte. The girl who made it took it back after I said something and proceeded to pour a HOT latte into a cup with ice which completely ruined the drink. It tasted like flavored coffee water. Why the hell would you pour hot steamed milk and hot espresso over ice instead of just remaking it like you are supposed to. I couldn't even drink it and was already out of the area so I went to Starbucks so I could at least get a quick coffee fix. Very disappointed especially because I have had good drinks there many times. It was nice while it lasted but I think I'll stick with coffee rush from now on.

After having an unpleasant experience with messing up my coffee I couldn't help but go back for their delicious campana sandwich and their frappes ( I live 6 mins away) I have good experiences when I visit especially with Kaiya ( sorry I butchered your name) She is the only employee that stands out just because she is genuinely very sweet and pleasant to talk to. I'm sure there are boatloads of other regulars that can arrest to that. Her sweetness needs to rub off on the other employees!

Had the wheat berry salad with added chicken and it was pretty good! My boyfriend got the regular cheeseburger and his was yummy too! Hummus appetizer wasn't anything special and pita bead was a bit soggy. If you're in the mood for pub food and alcohol this place is a decent spot

They do a good job with both manicures and pedicures. The staff seems nice to regulars but mostly they don't talk ( which I prefer because i hate small talk ). No reason to rate poorly when I always leave happy and my feet feel amazing after!

Nice little coffee shop in the heart of downtown Mesa. Baristas are very friendly which means a lot to me because for some reason I've met a lot of snobby baristas in my travels. Try the gold rush latte ( think that's the name)! It's made with condensed milk, vanilla and espresso. It was absolutely perfect and delicious! All in all this place will do well with their great customer service, ambiance and drinks/food.

Nice little coffee shop in the heart of downtown Mesa. Baristas are very friendly which means a lot to me because for some reason I've met a lot of snobby baristas in my travels. Try the gold rush latte ( think that's the name)! It's made with half and half milk, vanilla and double espresso. It was absolutely perfect and delicious! All in all this place will do well with their great customer service, ambiance and drinks/food.

This place is soo good!! I had the tuna on Asiago bread and added cheddar with a side of their Parmesan kettle chips and their chocolate mousse dome. Every bite was delicious and perfect if you are in the mood for a tasty cafe style lunch. Very similar to paradise bakery to give you an idea. My 5 year old had a PB&J ( hold the J ) with milk and grapes and a cute fish shaped cookie and she loved it too! It came to about $18 for our meals which seems pretty reasonable for how good it was. I'm planning on going again in the morning with my kiddo for breakfast ( they apparently do all you can eat French toast ) would highly recommend.
