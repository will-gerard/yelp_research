my fiance and i are huge fans of mexican food and there's rarely a time that we're not in the mood to eat it.  when a friend told me they served a speciality frozen horchata drink, i knew we had to check it out.  the frozen horchata is served as a cocktail, and you have the option of getting it with either rum or vodka.  we opted to try both, and they were amazing! i definitely preferred the drink with vodka since it didn't take away from the flavor of the horchata like the rum did. after finishing his drink, my fiance ordered a jamaica margarita with chili on the rim.  i had a couple sips of it and it might have been better than the horchata!   chips and salsa can really make or break a mexican place for me, so i really appreciated that their chips were hot and salty while the salsas (red and green) were spicy and delicious.    i ordered the chile relleno, and it came out super hot and covered in tons of cheese. i really enjoyed the flavors of it, and was sad that i could only eat about a third of the meal.  the standard bean and rice sides were also really tasty and better than i've had in a while.   i will be definitely adding this place to my regular mexican restaurant rotation!

about six months ago, my grandmother gave me a ring that had belonged to my late grandfather in the hopes that i could have it made into something for my upcoming wedding (as my "something old").  i had no idea where to go, or which jewelers did custom work, so i turned to yelp.  after reading all the glowing reviews on burland, i decided to take it to them and see what they could do.   i wanted to maintain the design of the diamonds on my grandfather's ring but have it placed in a more delicate and feminine setting.  they found the perfect white gold band that kept the original look while updating the overall design.  while i was at the store, they even cleaned my engagement ring for free!   it took about two weeks to put together, and i was shocked at how beautiful it turned out! they were even able to use the scrap gold from the band of my grandfather's ring to put towards the payment of the new one.  and they cleaned my engagement ring again for free!   if you need custom work done or want to buy some new jewelry, this is a great shop to go to.  the two women i worked with were extremely friendly and professional and i never felt like they were trying to overcharge me or pressure me into higher priced bands.

one of my go-to cocktail spots in the biltmore area.  this place has been here forever but somehow manages to still maintain that "cool" appeal.  they have great cocktails and their weekend djs always play a good mix of songs.  the darkly lit interior and low-seating definitely help create a timeless feel when you're there.   my normal drink is a moscow mule, but the sweet little sixteen and the blackbird are tasty as well.  they also have some upscale bar food if you're interested in snacking while you throw back your 4th old fashioned.

i hope the owners and/or management read this review so they can be made aware of the terrible experience i had at noon today (2/21/13).  unfortunately i don't know the name of the female employee working during this time-she was on the short side with long, dark hair in a ponytail.  several sales were lost today due to her total incompetence.   -   i should have known when i walked in and received no greeting from the barista that this was going to be a stellar time.   there was only one other customer standing at the counter, and two women waiting for their coffee to be made.    as i approached the counter, i realized that what i originally thought was a customer was actually a friend of the barista's. the two of them were completely engrossed in some conversation about who knows what while the barista finished the coffee for the two waiting women.   once she finished, i waited for her to acknowledge me and take my order.  instead, she continued right on with her conversation with her pal, never breaking to say hello or even make eye contact!  instead, the two of them kept on chatting while she started making herself a coffee!   meanwhile, another customer walked in and stood behind me at the counter.  the two of us exchanged a few perplexed looks as the barista/pal nonsense continued on with no end in sight. after several minutes of this, he decided to give up and leave. the barista took no notice of this.    at that point, i glanced at my phone and realized i had been standing there for a full ten minutes! ten minutes, debit card in hand, standing two feet from the barista with not even the slightest acknowledgement whatsoever.   was it possible that i died in the car ride to hava java and no one could see me?   that was enough for me. i backed away from the counter and got the hell out of there.     hava java-you should be absolutely ashamed at how this employee is treating your customers. i do not plan to ever return, and i'm sure the other customer who walked out will be thinking twice about where he gets his coffee from now on.

i dunno man.   this place is practically walking distance from my house, but for some reason i've never made it here.  after reading all the good reviews, i figured i'd drive through for some late snacks.   first, the woman working the drive through didn't speak any english, so it took an unnecessarily long time to order.    next, i only ordered two things-a california burrito and a horchata. i paid with a card and she's didn't say how much the food was when i gave it to her.  when i got home i looked at the receipt and saw i was charged SIXTEEN DOLLARS for these two items! i didn't look at the cost of the burrito, but i did notice a large horchata was something like $3 on their menu.  no way that burrito could have cost $13, so i must have been charged for two. ugh!   after reading all the reviews about how ~amazing~ their aqua frescas are, i could not believe how awful the horchata was.  it was extremely watery and obviously made with a powder mix as i could taste the graininess in the drink.  the actual flavor was very weird as well, it didn't taste like any horchata i've ever had (and i've had a lot).   the california burrito was the saving grace and was actually really delicious.  unfortunately since the rest of the experience was so annoying and i was overcharged, i think i'm going to stick with bertos or vaquero for my late night fat snacks.

oh postino, i dream about your bruschetta.   this little wine bar is one of the best (if not the best) in the valley-and i love that's it's only a mile from where i live! although they're open late, i really think of postino as more of a lunch/happy hour spot.  this is a salad/sandwich/bruschetta place, and to me that just doesn't say dinner.    regardless! it's awesome and they have great wine deals-from 11-5pm all wine by the glass and pitchers of beer are $5, bottles are $9 off if you get it to go, and on monday and tuesdays you can get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20!   anyways, on to the amazing bruschetta. you get your choice of four different toppings (2 pieces per topping-great for sharing!) and they are all so so good! my favorites are the ricotta with dates and pistachios, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the smoked salmon with pesto.  but you can't go wrong with any of them, they're all that good and there's something for everyone's tastes.    parking is sort of a hassle-so just save yourself the trouble and valet. also, it can get pretty loud during lunch time, so be aware of that if you're trying to have a quiet time.   either way, if you haven't been-go! you won't regret it.

even though i live roughly 15-20 minutes from this store, i still make it a weekly habit to come here for groceries.   the breakdown:   sushi. their selection of rolls and sashimi are awesome! i love that i can buy a brick sized piece of salmon sashimi to take home and slice up myself. while i do love aj's sushi bar as well, whole foods definitely has them beat.   juice bar. whenever i come in to do my shopping, i always head straight to the juice bar for one of their delicious fresh drinks. every juice mix i've tried has been fantastic, even if the fruit/veggie combo sounded like it might not work together.  produce. really terrific selection of fruits and vegetables. i especially love their huge variety of pre-cut produce; it makes cooking super convenient!  in addition to carrying a lot of great companies that i can't get at any other local stores, their stuff is generally totally affordable.  a grocery store with a unique selection can mean higher prices (aj's), but i usually leave whole foods feeling pretty pleased with what i ended up spending.   ps. i'm super pumped for the new store that's opening on camelback next month! now i'll have a store within a mile of my house!

my go-to mexican place!  i've been eating here for years and i love this restaurant.  it could probably use a bit of a makeover, but the food is authentic, fresh and delicious.  i probably eat here once or twice a month and i've never been disappointed.  they have a pretty huge menu, so there's lots of options for everyone.  they have some of the best chips and salsa in the valley-i always order an extra pint when i get takeout because it's really that good. the salsa has tons of fresh veggies and jalape√±os diced up, so it's super tasty with the perfect amount of spice.  some of my favorite things on the menu are the cheese crisp with green chile, the mexican flag (3 enchiladas-1 beef with red sauce, 1 cheese with sour cream, 1 cheese with green chili pepper), and their beef chimi.  their tamales and tacos are great too!   oh and if you're feeling lazy, you can get their food delivered from delicious deliveries!

While Scottsdale is generally known for its nightlife, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find any quality bars in the area to go to. Kazimierz is the kind of place that's just hidden enough to give it that "cool" vibe while still possessing a pretty laid back feel. I love how dark and dungeony it feels (in a good way!) and the way the place smells.   Sunday's are a fun night to pop in. While most places are dead on Sunday nights, you'll find a great crowd of industry people from all the local restaurants and bars enjoying their night off.   The cocktail menu constantly changes, so every time I go I get to try something new. The last time I went, all the drinks were Disney themed!  And when you go, be sure to try the Nikolaschka shot!

ugh, this place.   i had an ex-boyfriend who loved this restaurant, so i've eaten here more times than i can count-and let me tell you, this place sucks. straight up. it's gross and dirty inside and the servers always seem like they've got something better to do.  i don't know how this is even a thing, but the chips are always, and i mean always, stale. they have this terrible rubbery taste and the salsa has no flavor.  chips and salsa are kind of my thing, so if you can't get that right it really sours me.  as for food authenticity? no way are you getting that here. they use cheap meat that tastes like it's cooked in a microwave and looks like it too. they claim their chile relleno is "famous", but good god have they butchered it.  if you're eating here and you see a puffed up dish that looks like brains going by, there it is. ugh.    i really don't understand why this place is so popular when they have such awful food-you could get a better meal at taco bell. oh, and president bush loves it, so that should tell you everything you need to know.

low carb dieting is awesome.   aaaaaand it sucks.   here's the deal-i love meat and dairy items, but i also love bread, so being deprived of it is the pits.  when i heard mamma mia's had a low carb pizza (uh, 10 carbs for the whole thing? what?) i just about flipped my lid.  i still feel like they're somehow lying because i don't understand how that's even possible, but whatever, i'm not pushing it.  i first found out about this pizza two or so months ago, but like an idiot, totally forgot and never got around to ordering it.  fast forward to tonight when i was feeling cranky, tired, and in need of a pizza fix. bam!  mamma mia's low carb pizza is a thing i can have for dinner! and i can have it delivered to my lazy ass!   i chose to get it with garlic, fresh basil, pepperoni, and black olives-and boy did it not disappoint! the crust isn't your typical pizza crust, but more of a tortilla-like situation.  i would say it's more comparable to a thin crust pizza except not as crispy.  no, it doesn't have all that doughy-breadness you're used to, but for a low carb pizza, it's pretty freakin' awesome.  since the crust is so thin, it doesn't hold up super well when you try to handle a slice, but i was able to fold it in half and still enjoy it.    if you're low carbin' it up and missing pizza, check out mamma mia's! i wish more people had awesome options like them!

ate here with a party of 9 last weekend before going out for the night and we all had a fantastic time. they were great at accommodating our large group-we must have changed our dinner time about 5 times because plans kept changing, and they had no issues with our requests.   our group ordered a ton of things and were really impressed with the freshness and preparation of the food. yes this restaurant is expensive, and the portions are small, but this is vegas-expect to pay for quality.   stand out items included the waygu wasabi cream sashimi, yellowtail jalape√±o, kobe gyoza, and the hanger steak.   if you're looking for a standout sushi restaurant in vegas, this is a great place to check out. it's conveniently located in crystals shopping center and is close to other cool spots like the cosmopolitan and the aria.

good store near campus for buying all of your art or school supplies.   i have to come here pretty often to stock up on stuff, and they almost always have what i need. the employees are really familiar with what's in stock and where things are, so it makes it convenient when i need to get a ton of different items and don't want to wander around looking for hours.   if you're like me and live closer to arizona art supply than utrecht, i recommend making the drive out to tempe regardless. although az art supply is a decent store and they get their stock from the same supplier as utrecht, they are often out of things or don't carry what i'm looking for.   utrecht's prices are comparable to other art stores in the valley, and they give out some pretty decent discounts if you're a student. the only downside is that they can get busy during the school year. on more than one occasion i've had to stand in line for 20+ minutes.

after a pretty intense bachelor/bachelorette party weekend, my fianc√© and i decided we'd stay here for a "recovery" day so we could just relax.  we stayed in the augustus tower in the royal suite on the top floor. our views were insane-the bedroom overlooked the fountains of the bellagio and the living room had floor to ceiling windows with views up and down the strip. we had spent the previous two nights in a suite with a pretty stellar view at the aria, but this room totally had it beat.    caesars has this nice mix of new/old vegas and is conveniently located near everything. i'd stay here again for sure!

I don't know how it is that I haven't gotten around to reviewing the BEST HAIR SALON EVER.  I love this place, seriously.   I think I've had just about every service possible that they offer done to my hair and I'm always happy with the results. You can't go wrong with Kandi or Jenny, both are hair masters and total sweethearts. The rest of the staff is great as well, and I love the laid back unpretentious vibe the salon has.   If you're looking for a new salon, this is your place!

DRIVE-THROUGH GREEK FOOD, GUYS.  I've been coming to Z's since they opened, and I'm always impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  Yes, it may look a little whatever from the outside, but don't let that sway you! The food is absolutely delicious, well priced, and did I mention the drive-through?!  As a Greek person, it can be pretty difficult to find quality stuff in this town, but Z's totally fits the bill. Their hummus and lentil soup are some of the best I've had and I love that the pita bread is always warm and soft. If you're a fan of Greek food, I highly recommend you check this place out!

i've been coming here the entire time i've had my dog (six years), and while it's a little pricey, i always feel like she's in good hands.    when i had her spayed years ago, they called me soon after dropping her off to let me know they had run some tests and it looked like she had a very slight irregular heartbeat.  they recommended i take her to a specialist in order to run some further tests and make sure she could handle being put under anesthesia.  i really appreciated that they didn't ignore this small irregularity and just go ahead with the surgery. i've heard tons of horror stories about how easy it is to have an animal slip away while they're under and it really comforted me to know they were taking all the necessary precautions. long story short, my pup was able to get spayed after getting the thumbs up from a cardiologist and has been fine since!   i also use their grooming services and they always make my dog look great! recently though it seems that they only have one groomer available so it can take a long time to get an appointment. hopefully they'll hire some more on soon.

zach: do you want to go into chanel? sober nicki: noooo way.  -cut to four cocktails later-  tipsy nicki: let's go to chanel.  long story short:  i bought a new bag and now my future children can't go to college.   but in all seriousness, this is a really nice boutique located within the bellagio with all the chanel gear your heart could ever want.  the sales person who helped me was very friendly (no snobby 'tude at all) and didn't pressure me into buying anything or make me feel rushed.  if you're into high end nonsense like i occasionally am, this is a fantastic store to check out.

oh kohnie's coffee, i'm so glad you've finally gone out of business. i always hated you and your bad service, jerks who didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom, and the annoyance that you'd somehow managed to stay in business for so long.  i drive camelback road nearly daily, and i was pleasantly surprised to see you'd been replaced by a place called chestnut lane.  i checked it out online and reviewed the menu before actually making it down there; a little pricey sounding for the food (up to $9.50 for a sandwich? just the sandwich?), but definitely the kind of lunch time yuppy gourmet style i enjoy.   anyways, i headed down there earlier today and ordered the chicken salad sandwich, tomato soup, and the blackberry lemonade iced tea. this totaled me around $20, which i found to be steep for lunch, but whatevs, i can deal. before ordering though, i asked if they took american express, which they said they didn't, but when i informed them it was the only card i had on me, they said they'd make an exception. what? i thought companies either took it or they didn't. strange.  anyways, later i realized that they hadn't made me sign anything for running my card, nor had they given me a receipt.   the interior of the store was quant and rather plain, which i enjoyed. there were salads and various bakery items displayed which i'd like to try at some time in the future as they all looked tasty.   my food was all good, but i wouldn't say it was anything too outrageously amazing.  i definitely prefer the food at other lunch spots like postino or bertha's, but i'd eat here again.

when aa first hit the scene years ago, i'll admit that i fell for their whole shtick hook, line, and sinker. i liked coming to these stores for the basics (tank tops, tees, super soft hoodies).  over the years, the quality of the clothing has gone way downhill, while the prices seem to have increased; most of the shirts don't seem to last more than a few washes.    it literally hurts to even go into one of these stores. for some reason, this one in particular seems to have notoriously awful service.  no one says hi, no one helps you, and they barely even look up when you walk in. ugh, you're cool, i get it!   if you have to buy something from here, i suggest just ordering it online. actually, scratch that, go to target. you can get the same things and they'll actually last.

this is the second time i've stayed at the aria and it really is one of the nicer hotels on the strip. we stayed in a beautiful two bedroom penthouse sky suite with a great view of the strip. i love that everything in the room is automated and they have some of the most comfortable beds i've ever slept on. one of my favorite features of the room is the steam shower; so relaxing after a long night!    if you can, i definitely recommend upgrading to a sky suite; you get to avoid the super long check in lines and get access to free snacks in the lounge. this came in handy whenever we were heading out (or back) and wanted a quick bite or coffee. i'm already missing their chocolate macaroons!

this place straight up rules.  it definitely possesses all the requirements i have for an awesome restaurant: a mile from my house, delicious cocktails, cool atmosphere, friendly staff, and amazing food!   this is an all around great place to take just about anyone.  seriously-take your parents, kids (if they aren't loud jerks), date, or friends-everyone will be happy with the selection.  i've eaten in the restaurant many times, but usually i opt to just sit at the bar and throw back some drinks and enjoy their meat and cheese plates.  they have an awesome selection of both so you really can't go wrong with whatever you choose.  their beet salad is also killer; it comes with walnut crusted goat cheese, avocado, and fennel-yum!  oh and check out their daily lemonchello!

i reallllly need to come here more often. this is definitely a little gem of a mexican restaurant that fires on all cylinders.   the restaurant itself is adorable-i love all the awesome dia de los muertos paintings on the walls and the unique decor. while it isn't in the greatest neighborhood, you'd have no idea once you walked inside.    the salsa bar! oh my god, i don't even know where to start with how amazing this thing is.  i am a huge salsa fan (wouldn't mind eating it with every meal, or as a meal, whatever) and i've never known of a restaurant to have so many options! i could literally come here and only eat chips and salsa for hours and never get bored because of all the choices!   horchata! they put an interesting spin on the horchata by adding pecans and fresh fruit to it.  i thought this might be weird since i've never had it that way, but it was totally delicious and refreshing.    food! the menu is packed with delicious items that have some unbelievable flavors.  i recommend the carne asada burrito or the bullet (bean and cheese).    i'll be coming back soon!

stopped in here last month after eating dinner at the house with some of my fianc√©'s work buds. they wanted to go get some cocktails after, so we thought we'd give this craphole a go.   THERE WAS NO A/C ON.   IN JULY.   and the place was still packed! it stunk of bo and was just disgusting. i demanded we get out of there before we all passed out from heat stroke.   avoid.

more like shady town!  i brought my dog here a few months ago  since her usual groomer was booked for about a month.    i should have known when i walked in that this place wasn't going to be any good; it's pretty dingy looking inside and it isn't in the best location.    cut to several hours later-they call me at 4:45pm and tell me that my dog is ready to be picked up, but that they close in fifteen minutes and if i don't get there by 5 she'll have to stay overnight. uh! no!   i told the woman i was in scottsdale, so it would take me a few minutes to get there. her response: well you better hurry! ughghghg.  i sped over there as fast as i could since there was no way i was going to have my dog trapped there overnight-are they insane?   when i arrived i pulled out my card to pay and they informed me that they only take cash or checks. dude. you've got to be kidding me-isn't that something you usually tell your customers beforehand? and what reputable business doesn't take cards? so shady! so i had to run to the bank, take out cash, then come back so i could collect my dog.    they did an "ok" job on the haircut, but they tied these super tight ribbons on both sides of her ears that she was pawing at the entire ride home.  it took me about a half an hour to get them out because they had tied them in so tightly.  i should have never strayed from my original groomer-avoid this place.

ok. man.   i'm on yelp pretty frequently, and although i usually just opt for posting photos of restaurants and their food instead of actually writing reviews, my experience of the duce just has to be told.   so it's your average sunday. the weather outside was perfect and i wanted to get out and try something new for lunch and possibly get some day drinking in.  after looking over a few places downtown on yelp, the dude and i settled on the duce.    WHAT A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, MISTAKE.   now don't get me wrong, i knew that the duce was going to be in an old warehouse downtown that someone had turned into a restaurant.  in fact, that's what drew me in in the first place.  that and the menu sounded like they had some choice lunch items. meatball sliders? yeah man, let's do this.  that and in addition to the restaurant, they also sell clothing and other accessories. it was all sounding pretty good.   when we first entered the warehouse, we were in the area that sold clothing and other knick-knacks.  because the place is pretty huge, we weren't exactly sure where the restaurant was, and were hoping one of the MANY employees who were standing around might steer us in the correct direction. but no, not a single word from anyone. ok fine, whatever.   so we locate the restaurant portion of the warehouse, and see many long bench style tables, a bar, and an outside portion with more seating.  we spot the bartender and say hello as we're walking up, hoping that she'll inform us of how this all works (do we just sit wherever and have a waiter take our order? do we order at the bar? etc.). the bartender shoots back a quick hello and then immediately begins to chat it up with another waitress, completely ignoring that we're even there. ooook, i guess we're just supposed to figure this out ourselves!  we see that they've got their menu posted on the wall, so we begin looking at it, trying to figure out what we're going to order since we're assuming at this point that we just order at the bar.  after deciding on what we wanted, we stood around for literally another five minutes while the bartender and the waitress continued to chat and totally ignore us while we were just standing around clearly looking confused. oh, and did i mention we're THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE?   eventually we became so annoyed with this that we decided to go outside and have a seat at one of the tables hoping that would get the attention of someone.  so we have a seat and anticipate that maybe one of the ten or so people outside who clearly worked there would maybe attempt to help us or even acknowledge our presence at some point, but again, no! literally no one said anything to us!   after a few minutes of discussing how severely uncomfortable this was and whether or not we should just leave, the bartender comes rushing out and says, "so did you guys want to order or what?".  uh, ok! whatever! let's order now that you've decided we exist!  she then tells us that we're going to have to actually get up and come back inside to the bar to order, and that they'll call our name when the food is ready.  the hell? you can't take our order here since we're already seated and were too busy having some chit-chat time when we were standing inside trying to order before? screw. this. place.  and i haven't even tried the food yet.  oh, and you would also assume that since we ordered the food at the bar, we would pick it up at the bar as well, but again, no. you pick it up at the trailer that's parked outside where they're cooking it.  and yanno, this would have been fine had the bartender taken five seconds to actually mention this.   so the food was surprisingly quite good (shocking!), but honestly, who even cares at this point.  i was so angry at how annoyingly awful this experience was that it just didn't matter to me how the food tasted, and i really just wanted to get the hell out of there.  upon leaving, no one said goodbye to us or even acknowledged that we were exiting, but i was pretty much expecting that.  and just in case you forgot,  can i say again how we were THE ONLY PEOPLE THERE?    the concept of the duce may be a good one, but with such extremely rude employees that can't take five seconds to tell you how the restaurant works (oh hey! you order at the bar, we'll call you're name, you pick up the food at the trailer!) or even acknowledge that they have customers, i really can't understand how this place is going to survive.  i honestly do hate to be hard on a local restaurant, and wish i could say that maybe this could have been an isolated incident, but based on a lot of the other reviews, i can see that it's not.   so in summary: i would never, ever, under any circumstance, go here again. this was truly the worst restaurant experience i've had in...uh, ever.

love fresh & easy! i'm so happy to have one of these stores so conveniently located near my house.   my favorite part of the store is their ready to cook veggies and meat section. i love that they do all the prep work; it makes putting together a complete meal really simple. i eat a lot of meat/fish/vegetables since i'm on a low carb diet, and before i was using fresh & easy's ready to cook stuff, my foods were getting real bland. they keep it fresh (har) by always adding new items so i never get bored.  my favorite things to get are the jalape√±o and poblano burgers, salmon poke, mediterranean veggies, and the new york steak with peppercorn sauce. yum!   they have a lot of other great stuff in the store too-like low carb bread that only has 6g per slice! awesome! oh and tons of delicious high carb bakery items if you're into that.

i don't get my nails done too often, but when i do, this is my go-to spot. they're quick, easy, clean, and i love that they don't talk too much. maybe that's just me, but i'm not a huge fan of making small talk for an hour every two weeks. my nails always turn out perfect and look great for weeks!  if you're looking for a new nail spot in the arcadia area, check out ken's! you won't be disappointed!

don't even bother unless you have bottle service. but that goes for pretty much every club in vegas.   we came in a group of 9 on 8/10 to see madeon dj and had a pretty spectacular time. we had a prime table inside the club just next to the dj booth that allowed for some great people watching and tons of room to dance/mingle.   bottle service perks:  immediate entry. it only took the host a minute to find our reservation and then our group was whisked inside.   dedicated bottle servers. the girls were super friendly and attentive-they stayed at our table the entire time mixing our drinks and constantly refilling empty glasses. they were also all totally hot, so that was a plus for my guy friends.   the booths. huge elevated booths with plenty of room to dance and check out the crowd. clubs often charge ridonk fees for tiny tables that only a few people can sit at-ours easily allowed our entire group to sit comfortably.  they even had drawers underneath the tables to stash your purses so you don't have to leave them out in the open if you wanted to wander around.   security. security at clubs are often notoriously awful douches-this place is the exception. one of my friends iphone died and the security guard actually went and found a charger for him!   the club. the actual club is pretty small but the outside area is huge! there's several pools and all of the people milling around seemed totally laid back and in a good mood. this made it great when we wanted to take a break from the crazy club atmosphere and get some fresh air.   the music. madeon didn't come on til pretty late (after 1), but the opening dj played a really great mix of electro/indie/hip hop. i was with a pretty varied group of people (some of which hate clubs) and everyone was really enjoying themselves.   conclusion-this is a totally fun club if you spend the money to get bottle service. if you have enough people in your party it's totally cost effective too. without it, you're looking at spending $30-50 a person for entry and about $20 per drink. that adds up fast. then factor in all the time you'll waste standing in line to get in, standing at the bar waiting for a drink, listening to your girlfriends complain about how their feet hurt and there's nowhere to sit, or how you can't dance because it's packed.   do yourself a favor and splurge for the bottle service. chances are you're not local and you came to the club for a sweet time-so make sure you have one!

bean and cheese burrito. oh my god.   since i first discovered their bean and cheese burrito, i knew i was a fan of this restaurant for life.  i don't know how they get the beans and cheese to be so perfectly combined (they seem like they're whipped together), but it makes for an amazingly delicious burrito.  i come here almost every week because i'm constantly craving them-they're seriously that good. get it with avocado to make it even more tasty!   ok-now that you know how obsessed i've become with this delicious creation-i can tell you about all the other things i love.    COCHATA!   holy crap! as someone who already loves horchata, i nearly lost my mind when i had this combination of horchata and coffee. i can get two of my fixes in a single drink and it tastes amazing.    i'm also a huge fan of their carne asada burritos, the meat has an incredible flavor and is really tender.  the america's corn is also a favorite of mine; the flavors of the cotija cheese, lime, and chili go perfectly with the corn.  and they have mexican coke! how great is this place?

why does this place insist on letting you know how great their delivery is when they only have a delivery radius of ONE MILE? i live two miles from this location and apparently that's just ~too far~ for them.  anyone can have super fast delivery if they only have to drive a mile! the most amusing thing to me is that within a 3 mile radius of my house there are THREE jimmy john's and not one will deliver to me. seriously, it's ridonk.

i've been in the process of getting a small tattoo removed for a while now, and let me tell you, it hasn't been fun.  fortunately the team at delete has made things as smooth as possible!   when i originally started this process, i wasn't sure where to go and turned to the internet for help.  i found a place in north scottsdale that i went to twice (can't remember the name unfortunately), and it ended up getting infected after the second treatment. the staff/doctors were rude and uncaring and didn't have any suggestions as to what i should do about my infection.  i ended up having to go to my GP in order to get some antibiotics to get rid of it.  needless to say, i did not return to that place.  i searched for a while to find a new tattoo removal office, but couldn't find anyone that sounded reputable.  i basically gave up looking for about a year, and was stuck with this weird looking faded tattoo. then a friend of mine asked if i had heard of delete as she had been going there and was having great success with her own removal.  delete has been fantastic in helping -delete- this stupid thing and it's finally almost gone!  since the tattoo is small, it's super affordable for the treatments, and it only takes the wonderful dr. mundt about five minutes to laser it. they also offer lidocaine to numb the area, but i never get it since it really doesn't hurt and is over so quickly.    only a few more sessions to go!

so glad i went here! this is a beautiful three floor bar located inside the cosmopolitan hotel with some seriously amazing drinks. the entire bar sits inside of a giant chandelier with millions of beaded curtains with lovely purple/pink uplighting that gives the entire place a warm glow.    each level has different cocktails and is a different experience. we opted for the second level as they specialize in more experimental mixology.   i had the "fit to be thai'd" and it was delicious! it tasted just like a boozey thai tea and was probably my favorite drink. my fianc√© had the verbena, which comes garnished with a szechuan button.  if you've never had one of these little buttons, you must try one! they feel like pop rocks when you're chewing it, and it makes your mouth completely numb for a few minutes.   after he ate his, he insisted that we all had to try them because it was such a weird sensation. our super friendly waitress was kind enough to bring out a bunch more so everyone else in our party could give them a try.   if you're someone who enjoys a good speciality cocktail you won't regret drinking here!

i've found my new coffee shop.   i'd been on the hunt for a while now, and while there are about ten within a mile of my house, none of them were really doing it for me.  unfortunately, these shops tend to be of the starbucks or  "someone is playing live music and that annoys me" variety.  so anyways, on to royal.  the space is minimal and modern, they were playing great music, and the barista who helped me was very friendly.  oh, and my latte was amazing. really. amazing.  the only part that kind of sucked was that there was no place to tip on the credit card slip, and i unfortunately had no cash. the barista seemed to sincerely not mind, and informed me they'd be changing that within the next few weeks.   now that i've found a coffee shop that's super close to my house and has some seriously solid coffee, i'll definitely be coming back regularly. and with cash. at least until they get that tipping situation on lock.

several years ago i made a dinner reservation for my fianc√©'s birthday at kai.  if you know anything about that place you'd know it's the only five diamond restaurant in arizona, so it sounded like it would be an amazing spot for a birthday celebration.    long story short, we had a TERRIBLE time.  like, super infuriating i hope this place burns to the ground five diamonds are you kidding me terrible.  we actually walked out before we even got a chance to eat because that's how bad it was.   since kai is about 45 minutes from our house, by the time we got back to our area of town it was 9:45pm and practically every nice restaurant was closing.  i figured my fianc√©'s birthday dinner plans were completely ruined and i felt god awful. that is until i turned to yelp and saw that citizen public house was open late and still serving!   the service we received was a complete 180 from what we experienced at kai and the food was absolutely amazing! even with a $100 celebratory bottle of champagne (seriously needed after what we had experienced), our bill was half of what it would have been at kai.  since this initial dinner, citizen has become one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  the chefs/owners/bartenders are constantly pushing themselves to create amazing things and they always succeed!   whether you're in the mood for a romantic dinner, late-night snack, or a cocktail at the bar, this is a great place to go.  and if you're there on thursday-saturday, head upstairs after dinner to citizen r+d; their cocktails will blow your mind!

i both hate and love that bosa is only about five blocks from my house. their donuts really are that good.   the cream of the crop is the buttermilk donut-it's moist, fresh, and delicious. i usually don't like super sweet donuts with tons of frosting/filling, so this is the perfect little glazed piece of heaven. i make everyone who goes here try one if they haven't already-they're really that good.   i LOVE that they have thai tea here as well. i often swing by the drive through and just get that-although it is hard to resist getting a donut too. you even have the option of boba, and they have some other rad smoothie/drink choices as well (taro, etc.).   i've also noticed they have sandwiches that look pretty good but i've never tried one.  hard to think about sandwiches when you have donuts on the mind!

what can i say about a place like charlie's?   if you don't go to asu, there's no reason you would ever come here unless you were  visiting someone. actually, scratch that, you probably wouldn't ever come here unless you're a design student.  located on the second floor of design north, charlie's is the go-to break spot for students when they need a coffee fix.  during the school year, i come here daily (sometimes twice daily, depending on how many hours i've been in the building) and they always take care of my coffee needs.    the employees are super friendly and they make a great cup of coffee. they're always playing good music and they even do coffee art. cute!   they also carry bagels, sandwiches, pastries, naked juices, and bottled water if you're interested in that.  down the hall there's three vending machines that carry soda and snacks if you need a sugar fix.   oh and at 3pm they have happy hour (half off all drinks with espresso).

i'm totally over this place.   when they first opened, i really enjoyed this hidden little neighborhood bar and their fun selection of drinks.  cut to six months later and this gem has warped into some overblown douche trap. "hidden" bar? yeah, not so much. when there's valet parking, a bar expansion, wall to wall people, and horrific service from the waitresses/bartenders, i wouldn't call this a neighborhood bar anymore.  oh, and their previously awesome drinks are totally mediocre now.   no. thank. you.

hands down, crudo is one of my favorite restaurants in phoenix.    everything on their menu is phenomenal. i highly recommend the ahi and the albacore; the fish is so fresh and delicious that i'm practically salivating just thinking about it.    i've eaten in the restaurant several times as well as sitting at the bar for happy hour.  their bartender micah has got to be one of the best mixologists in phoenix, and will blow your mind with some amazing creations.  there's been many times that i've asked him to surprise me with a drink, and he's put together some truly delicious off-menu cocktails.   i really don't have enough good things to say about this restaurant.  i took my mother here once when she was visiting from san diego, and she now insists that we go here every time she's in town.  so if you haven't been yet, go!

before searsucker opened in scottsdale, i dined at the one in downtown san diego and absolutely loved it! when i heard we were going to be getting one here, i was thrilled. i could finally have my peter rabbits anytime i wanted them!  i've probably been to the scottsdale location 5-7 times, and have loved everything i've eaten so far. you absolutely have to try the squid-it's like nothing i've ever eaten before. the pieces are huge and the dipping sauce it comes with is so good. i recently had the tomahawk and couldn't believe how delicious it was-and massive!   i also can't say enough about the entire staff and their commitment to service.  a few months ago, a good friend was throwing a birthday party for her husband and the restaurant we were supposed to go to cancelled on her the day of!  she called me in a panic and i recommended we try searsucker to see if they could fit us in last minute on a saturday night.  they were able to accommodate our party of TEN with absolutely no problems and the restaurant was packed that night! everyone in our party loved the food, service, and atmosphere.  the staff was so attentive and my friend couldn't have been happier with my recommendation.

let me start by saying that i have never, and i mean -never-, considered boarding my maltese, chloe.  that is until my usual pup sitter (father-in-law) was going to be out of town at the same time as me and i had absolutely no one trustworthy to watch her.  i was on the verge of a serious mini-meltdown until i found d pet hotel on yelp.    i decided to swing by one day to check out their facility and was immediately impressed.  the place is absolutely spotless-there's no dog odor (seriously, how is that even possible?), and i could see all the happy dogs playing and having fun through a glass mirror.  a super friendly employee took me on a tour of the place and told me about all the services that my dog would be receiving if i chose to have her stay there.  AMAZING PROS:   the rooms!  this is what really blew me away-there's an actual bed and flatscreen tv in each of the suites in order to recreate the feeling that your dog is at home.  since my dog has a touch of the separation anxiety, it really put me at ease to know that she would be in a similar environment to our house.    playtime!  during the day the dogs are separated into groups by their size, and get to play in their indoor 4000 square foot park! fun!  food! they'll feed your dog their regular diet, regardless of what it is.  i give my pup food that has to be refrigerated, and they have no problems accommodating that.   car service! they'll even come and pick up your dog if need be.  i didn't use this service, but it's pretty awesome that they offer it.  emails! they email you every day with pictures of your dog so you can see what they're up to and how they're doing.  24 hour staff onsite! there's always someone there keeping an eye on the dogs. comforting!  CONS:  dude, none.   i signed my pup up for a 3 night stay on the spot! they made things hassle free by getting all the vaccination info from my vet themselves, so all i had to do was set up a temperament test for my dog.  once she passed that, i brought her in a few times for daycare just so she could get used to the place.  every time i brought her in, chloe and i were greeted by name and i felt as if i had been coming here for years.  they really put all my boarding fears to rest when i had to drop her off for her vacation.    if you're going out of town, or simply want to have your dog in daycare while you're at work, etc., this is hands down the place to go.  d pet hotel is a beautiful, clean facility with outgoing staff members who truly care about your dog's wellbeing.

what a huge pile of disappointment this place is. how this restaurant has four stars is a serious mystery to me.   my fiance and i came here for dinner one night when we were both absolutely starving.  we would have thought almost anything was delicious at that point, and we were still totally let down. in order to accommodate our crazy hunger, we ordered a ton of food. we started with the house made charcuterie plate and couldn't find anything on it that we enjoyed.  i love pickled foods, but there was something about the flavor that really turned me off.    next up was the creamy broccoli and brown ale soup.  this tasted like something you'd get at applebees or chili's and looked like it too.  it was so boring and generic-i figured the ale would give it an interesting flavor, but it just tasted like a bland bowl of whatever.   i know we ordered at least three other things, but they were so whatever that i literally can't even remember what they were.  i was also disappointed to later find out they have a tot of the day (loooove tater tots), but our server never mentioned them.   i can't see a reason to return to this restaurants unless it's for a cocktail only and i'm in the area.

this place is the grand master of drive-throughs.  i love that i have the option of getting tacos, burgers, chips, AND fresh lemonade without ever having to leave my car.  add a hot dog to the menu and i would flip out!  i usually go for the standard with cheese; it's huge, fresh, and super juicy.  it can often be a little bit of a mess, but who cares? this is a fast food place, people. their carne asada tacos are great as well-tender and full of flavor.  i'm not usually a banana person, but their banana stand milkshake is so so good and unlike any milkshake i've had.  definitely give it a shot if you want to try something new!   my only issue with this place is how backed up their drive-through can get, especially during peak hours.  they make everything fresh, so it obviously takes a little bit longer than your standard fast food place, but sometimes it can take 25+ minutes to get your food. i'm not sure if they need more people dedicated to cooking for the drive-through only or what, but i would give them 5 stars if they resolved this!

it's finally happened. i've found true love.  sorry whole foods on tatum and shea-it was nice while it lasted, but a new hottie has moved in up the block and i can't get enough.  ok, real talk. i was able to restrain myself from going on opening day, but i could only hold out so long and broke down on day 2.  AND I WENT TWICE. IN ONE DAY. and ONCE TODAY. so i've been 3 times in the 3 days they've been open. ugh. yes, i love it that much.   the sushi! the miles of baked goods! oh the rows and rows of meat! glorious meat! alcohol as far as the eye can see! and did i just see someone walking around the store with a beer?  oh, what a beautiful day it is to have a whole foods in the neighborhood.  of course it's totally packed and chaotic since i think everyone in the biltmore area is just as amped as i am to finally have a whole foods in the hood, but that's to be expected.  this is a beautiful, huge store, with every awesome food item you could ever want and people want to check it out. i don't blame them!  even with all of the people milling around, the employees were insanely friendly-i must have been asked if i needed help a least 20 times while i was there.   if you're not into crowds, i suggest you wait a bit until all the fuss dies down to go. then go and shop! shop to your yuppie heart's content!

went here last night for my birthday dinner and loved it!    i was pretty surprised when ruth chris closed, but was relieved to know that the people behind one of my favorite restaurants, citizen public house, would be taking over the location.  they did a lot of remodeling which really updated the space and included a really awesome looking bar.     for only being their second day open, they seem to have everything running super smooth.  this is definitely going to be a regular spot for me.  we started with the sausage/brioche pretzel/cheese and thought it was delicious. i get super pumped whenever i see pretzel bread anything, so i was excited to try this app and wasn't disappointed.  next we tried the lamb riblettes, and they were great as well. when i go back i'd like to get the chopped salad since i'm obsessed with the one at cowboy ciao (one of the owners of the gladly, chef bernie kantak, created it).    for our main courses i had the short ribs which were tender and full of flavor. they're coffee charred and come with a blueberry compote on top that gives it a lot of complexity.  my fianc√© had the filet mignon-a pretty classic dish that they cooked perfectly.    we had terrific service as well-generally when a restaurant first opens it can take the staff a few weeks to get the hang of all the menu items (totally understandable), but our server was totally on top of everything!   i highly recommend this new biltmore area restaurant-it's definitely going to be a local hot spot!

Went here for their soft opening last night and had an amazing time!    This is definitely going to be the new hot spot in downtown Phoenix.  You absolutely have to try the Solero, it's one of the best cocktails I've had in a long time.  I can't wait to go back!

This place is having a serious identity crisis.   Located in downtown Phoenix, this new establishment can't seem to figure out what it wants to be. Its all white interior, color changing lights and techno music scream Scottsdale lounge/bar, yet apparently they're a Polish restaurant. What?   I came here last weekend for a drink with some friends and was told they would be closing in 15 minutes. For a place with "bar" in the name, 11:30 seemed pretty early to be closing on a weekend night. But whatever, we only wanted to get one drink and check the place out.   Once seated at the bar, I asked the bartender why they were closing so early. He rudely shot back that they were "a restaurant, not a club" and are trying to set themselves apart from "all the other clubs downtown".  Hold up, buddy.  First, what clubs are you talking about? Yes, downtown does have a few clubs, but this isn't Scottsdale.   Next, for a place that's trying to set itself apart from all these supposed clubs, they're doing a hell of a job. Based on their over the top interior/exterior I had absolutely no idea this place was a restaurant until I was directly told so.     Again, let me reiterate that the place is all white, has color changing lights, and plays loud techno music. Oh! And did I mention the large bull statues outside? And the name! Milk BAR. BAR.    But whatever, let's get to the drinks already.  Their cocktail list is made up of six drinks and one shot. I tried the Clockwork and my friend had the Tatanka. I'm 100% sure the apple juice in the Tatanka was just some Martinelli's with a shot of vodka. Martinelli's has a very distinct flavor, so it was pretty clear that was the main ingredient. Pro tip: do not use bottled juice for your cocktails. The proportions of the ingredients in my Clockwork seemed very off; it was overly sweet and very thick and syrupy.    We ended up not finishing either drink and got the hell out of there. Maybe the food is awesome, but for a place that's trying to establish itself as a Polish restaurant and not a bar/lounge they're going to have a pretty rough time.

I just went here this past weekend and I honestly don't have enough good things to say!  Destiny's was recommended to me by my wedding planner, Amy Mancuso, and she couldn't have picked a better place.  Previous to my appointment, I have to say that I was really apprehensive about the whole dress-shopping thing. I assumed I would immediately hate every dress, look terrible in all of them, and have a snobby consultant who was only interested in a sale. My assumptions were completely wrong!  Lisa is the most incredible woman when it comes to listening to what you want and finding things that make you look amazing.  She spoke with me for quite some time in order to get a feel for who I am and the style that I was looking for even before she started pulling dresses.    Since she has so many in the store, she actually brings out an iPad for you to browse through so she can get a feel of the styles you like.  I really liked this touch since it can be difficult to tell what a dress looks like when it's hanging up and jammed next to a bunch of other ones on the rack.    All the dresses she pulled were incredibly beautiful! She had several in mind that she knew would be just my style, and a few different fun ones so I could compare.  She definitely knows how to make your figure look good because I couldn't believe how amazing I looked in everything I tried, even if it wasn't my style.   Also, she stood outside my dressing room the entire time, waiting just on me so she could zip my dresses and help me step into them if I needed assistance.  I never felt rushed or pressured in any way, and she even told me a few funny stories about each of the designers and the wedding dress she wore in the 80's.   We eventually narrowed it down to two dresses that my bridesmaids and I were in love with (the first two dresses I tried on! How crazy is that?), and told Lisa we needed a lunch break in order to make a final decision.  She encouraged us to go enjoy lunch and that I could even sleep on it if I needed more time to decide.  We came back immediately after lunch and chose dress #2, a beautiful Romona Keveza gown that I couldn't be happier with.    I am beyond thrilled with the beautiful dresses and wonderful service I received from Lisa at Destiny's Bride.  This is the place to go if you need a wedding dress!
