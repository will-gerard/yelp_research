I hate to leave a bad review because we went there tonight because I love karaoke  and that part was fantastic. however, this place really needs new bartenders. I think she said her name was mia, it was loud and hard to hear, but she was awful from the minute we got there. I arrived with a group of 7 people who  all ordered drinks. She acted like we were a nuisance to her and gave us dirty looks the whole time. When we asked her for drinks she rolled her eyed and scowled. My fianc√© is super sweet and thought she was having a bad day so he tried to cheer her up by complimenting her and  trying to make her laugh but she shot him dirty looks. There was only one other group there and they were obviously wasted. They could barely sing anymore and just kept bouncing around  and goofing off, which is normal for a bar. Except that she treated us like outsiders that didn't belong there. My friends went to cheer and spilled a tiny bit of beer because the glass was full. They were nice enough to apologize and clean it up and Mia told them they have to leave cause they were breaking things. There were 7 of us and not one person saw anything broken.. Just a few drops of beer that they so graciously cleaned up themselves. Mia said she didn't wanna clean up after us so we had to leave. At this point I decided she didn't deserve the nice tip my friend left on the counter. I told her to take it back, and the other bartender, an overweight brunette who's name I don't know, heard me and snatched it up quickly before I could. I had to tell Mia directly that she  gave us the worst service ever and I cannot allow my friend to tip her. She reluctantly gave it back. It takes this much for me to not tip someone. I'm a huge tipper. I work for tips too so I understand how this works, but I would never treat clients like she treated us. I earn my tips. This was literally the worst service I have ever had.  Mia needs to find a new career because service  and friendliness are not her forte.

Best shopping experience I have ever had. The customer service was superb.everyone was super friendly, attentive, and helpful, and they found me the perfect pair of shoes. I really love their return policy: wear it 90 days and if you don't like it, bring it back. I feel much more comfortable buying expensive shoes that I can put to the test. They also offer gait and foot analysis. Fantastic store. I will definitely be back.

I have been to every single comedy club in the Phoenix area,  and  stand up Scottsdale is the best. My friends and I have been going there nearly every week for the last 6 months, and our only complaint is the chest pain from laughing so hard.  The service is great, the food is delicious, drinks are reasonable and strong,  the atmosphere is perfect, the owner is super nice and I love hearing his stories, he is genuine and  I feel like he gives a bit of his soul, little pieces of his life artfully woven into humor. he brings in amazing talent every week, I have yet to see a bad show. keep up the good work SUS!!!
