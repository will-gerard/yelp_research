The slowest, mediocre car wash in Phoenix.   Not even that busy, on a Friday mid-afternoon and I've been here over an hour and I know I'll have to go back over the entire car when I get home.   This is a $3 car wash, at best.

On our way into the bike shop this afternoon (12/26 @1:30), we witnessed a bearded employee/owner chase down, yell at, and beat his black lab on the sidewalk. Animal abuse is inexcusable behavior. I certainly will not patronize this place again.

CLOSING FOR GOOD IN OCTOBER!  I eat here, maybe twice a month, and have never had a bad meal.  I was shocked when Suki (sp?) told me they were closing in October, for good.  Apparently they are having problems with a difficult (to put it nicely) landlord.   Make plans now to go and enjoy it while it lasts.    Heidi, have you tried the Egyptian Plate?  We usually go in and start with Hummus, Lentil Soup and then move on to the stuffed grape leaves or Egyptian Plate.  I also like the Falafal pita.

The exhaustive search is finally over!  I finally found a hair stylist who knows what he's doing, is friendly, takes his time, gives great conversation and a neck massage and is easy on the eyes.  I didn't even have to go home and fix anything after Bobby cut my hair, which is usually not the case.  I was so impressed that I set my next appointment before I left.  *** 5th HAIRCUT UPDATE *** After my 5th haircut with Bobby, I can not complain about a thing.  I don't even have to tell him how to cut my hair anymore.  He remembers what I want and how I like it.  He's so personable that he makes getting my hair cut an event rather than an appointment.      ******** November 08' UPDATE********** OK fellow Yelpers, you're really starting to ruffle my feathers!  I shouldn't have said such nice things about Bobby because now YOU people are making it difficult for ME to get an appointment (or as I like to call it, a date) with Bobby.  From now on, I'm going to start giving aliases for people who are in my reviews.    So forget all the things I said about that Bobby guy, that was an alias that I made up.  Really, the person who cut my hair was Frank or Fred or Fritz, I highly recommend him.  He's great if you can get past the multiple personality disorder.

**UPDATE** after 15 years, everyone is bound to have a mistake or two.  It's how you fix the mistake that makes all of the difference.  Shortly after my post, Angie reached out to me and got me to bring my dog back in, this time to see a different doctor.  We've had that visit and a follow-up, and my big mutt is well on her way to a full recovery.  Thanks Angie, and thanks Sebastiana.  **PREVIOUS REVIEW** I think my love/hate relationship with Alta Vista is about to end.  I love their hours and availability. There isn't another vet in town where you can be seen until 9pm, and have it be a normal office visit. And they're open all weekend too. I hate that if you have an appointment time, you have to wait in the lobby for 15-30min past that before you get into a room. From there, your wait continues on, and on, and on.... I hate that they charge $65 for a walk-in. Especially because their appointments are sometimes days out.  I now hate that the new doc is trying to put the fear of the world into me, for what should be a simple diagnosis, and then trying to high pressure sales me into a bunch more unnecessary testing and even more unnecessary X-rays.

I see that I am not alone in noticing that Pino's is going downhill.  I've lived right around the corner for the last 8 years, and this place has been a staple that whole time.   I was in here last night (Saturday) and there was one other table, and it was immediatly clear that Pino was not working.  The male employees were acting sketchy (details upon request), there was hispanic music blaring from the kitchen, the food was sub-par, and we got nickel-and-dimed for items that are supposed to come with our food.  When done right, the food here is to die for, but until then, ciao Pino.

This place has been here as long as I can remember.  I have replace the not-so Super Dragon with this place, and I'm happy I did.  The quality is good, service is good and friendly (unlike Super Dragon) and its easy to have an enjoyable meal here.

I just had my first Tammie Coe cake last week for my birthday, and I will NEVER be the same again.  I don't normally eat cake, in fact, if it's not Brownies, I don't eat it.  But this cake drew me in with it's appealing fondant.  From there, I got lost in the spongy richness of the cake.  A cornicopia of flaverful goodness.  So make a metal note to yourself, I will only eat Brownies and Tamie Coe cakes.  Oh, and special thanks to Arts G (previous review) for telling me what the hell fondant is.  I was just calling it "sheet like frosting".

I've been eating here as long as I can remember.  The food is much better than any of those chain restaurants, and the servers always go the extra mile for you, even when they're slammed.  The owners are almost always out on the floor working, cleaning, expediting, giving refills, or giving smiles :-)

seth, ted & graham (and all others w/less than 4 stars) must've gone to Bizarro Palatte.  I've got nothing but rave reviews for this place.    After moving in to downtown, I've been exploring different restaurants every chance I get, and Palatte is one of the best I've been to.  I went during the week with my family and everyone walked away full and pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, and the fact that the owner made time to talk to us.  I can see where some might get upset at not being waited on hand and foot, but lower overhead is the reason the owner's are able to bring such high quality foods to us for such a great price (Econ 101).   Sure, you could go to Matt's and wait in line for an hour, just to get bad service and greasy foods, but I'll stick with quality.  I'll be there again this weekend to sample some of what my Mom had (The Bev) along with a side of the Steel Cut Porridge that my sister wouldn't share with me.  Great job Ed & Christine!

Meh. Food was cooked well, ingredients were fresh, but everything was bland, and the proportions in the food were off on everybody's plate (e.g. way too many mushrooms when compared to the meat or eggs). Service was blah; there weren't many customers, yet we waited, and waited, and waited, for everything.   Bathrooms were pretty disgusting, not how I prefer to either begin or end a meal.   We probably won't be returning anytime soon.

WOW!  I guess I had a decidedly different experience here than most of the other Yelpers.    OK, to start, I'm a complete dork.  I do so much research before making large purchases, salesmen literally hate me.  They do, they really do hate me because I'm not about to be BS'd and I'll call their BS without hesitation.  With that said, I was on the quest for the best price on a new washer and dryer.  My last one flooded my guesthouse and then my garage.  So I started pricing new ones, searching Consumer Reports and talking to my people.  I settled on the fancy new front loaders by LG and priced them at every retail outlet I could find online.  Spencers was not one of them.  THEY DON'T HAVE A WEBSITE that you can check stuff out on.  How 90's is that??  I can't believe they've stayed somewhat competitive in this day and age. OK, so after Best Buy and Sears told me that they don't actually stock the items and that it'd be 7 - 10 business days before I got my new appliances that I'm going to pay almost $2k for, I decided to call Spencers and just see if they do have them and if they are even competitive.   To make a long story short, not only did they have the washer and dryer IN STOCK, they beat the pants off of Sears and Best Buy (I ruled out HomoDeopt and Lowes a long time ago).  And, I feel good that I shopped at a locally owned business.  I'll check them out 1st next time I'm in the market for a new appliance, then I'll check everybody else out.

I went to Maizie's last night, after downloading the Yelp App for my iPhone.  I was stunned at the quality of the food and the outstanding service.  Our server knew the menu, knew how to treat customers and had some great recommendations for us to try.  I got the Blue Burger, and it had the Blue Cheese stuffed inside the patty.  Yum.  And the fries were perfect.  Not the pre-made bag fries, but fresh cut with the skin on and deep fried to perfection (not soggy).  After settling the tab, we walked out and one of the staff (not our waitress) even poked her head out the door and said thanks and goodbye.  That's excellent customer service in my book.  There was only one thing wrong, and this goes for a large number of restaurants, bring me the bottle of ketchup (catsup), not some tiny little dipping cup.  I hate when, you're in the middle of your meal and you have to wait for a server to fetch you another ketchup (catsup).  We will be back to try some of the other menu items, that's a promise.

OK, for those of you who know me, you know that I'm forgetful.  When left unsupervised, as I was this weekend, I forgot to do somewhat important things (i.e. eat meals, shave, feed the fish...).  With that being said, on Saturday night after a day of working around the house, I realized that I was out of wine, and on my way to Safeway, I saw America's Taco shop was open.  I got a few bottles of wine for the night and went back down 7th, and got to America's seconds before 8pm.  Yes, they do close at 8pm on the weekends.  They gladly took my order and I sat and waited.  I always HATE being that guy who comes in right at close.  Thankfully, a couple came in close to 8:15 and they were just as nice to them as they were to me.  The owner/husband (I presume) came out and made small talk with me, and was very nice. Anyways, I digress.  I got the Carne Burrito, and the flavor was amazing!  I asked for the Pico on the side and got a good size portion of it.  I will be going back for more!  I want to try everything on the menu like Dyl W did.   If I don't forget to eat again today, I'm going to get the tacos.

USED CAR SALESMEN have more integrity than the sales staff at AT&T. I went in today to upgrade my iPhone and get an iPad added to my account.  I had already done my research, knew the plan I wanted, and the amount it should've come up to, and I checked the stock of both items (both were in stock). I went in to the brick and mortar store to see if AT&T would finally honor the military discount they kept telling me they had (have to show ID and renew contract).  The salesman, Henry, was unimpressive, and full of lies from the start.  He picked the wrong Marine to try to screw.   He started assembling a plan for me, and completely misrepresented the plans that were available, as well as the AT&T NEXT plan (this plan is a big part of where the salespersons get their commission off of).  I asked him what my plan would be without NEXT, and he made up a number that was only $9 less.  Henry, I can do math, and the amortization of a new iPhone over 24 months is slightly more than $9.  I indicated that I wanted to do the standard subsidized iPhone with a 2 year contract and skip the NEXT gimmick. When Henry came out from the back room, he indicated that they were out of all iPhones except the 128gb model, same with the iPad, and that if I didn't want those, I should go over to the Apple store or Best Buy.  Now I knew this guy was full of sh*t and had zero integrity.   I immediately called AT&T's customer service line, and the person I spoke with checked the stock, and yes, they had a large number of both the items I wanted, she also indicated that, unlike Henry, AT&T values our men and women in uniform, but there was nothing she could do to help me other than send me to a different store or the internet. I have been with AT&T for over a decade, and have had every iPhone since the first one came out. I am taking my hard earned cash and going to the other side.  Apple, I've been saying this from the beginning, you picked the wrong firm to jump in bed with.

I'm with the others, Doctor Allen ROCKS!  I had a particularly troublesome tooth and my dentist (Dr J) sent me to see Dr Allen for a reverse root canal (an Api-something).  Her office is high tech and her skills match her equipment.  Her staff worked with me on payment and when I had questions over the phone, they got answers back to me ASAP.  I don't ever want to see Dr Allen or her staff again, but if I need another root canal, I'm going to ask Dr J to send me there.

Every time I have been here, there have been major issues that leave me wondering why this place has such a following.  Saturday morning was no different. After waiting the mandatory 30+ minutes for a cramped table, we were seated and right away ordered our drinks, two iced teas and one lemonade.  The lemonade came out first, they teas came out about 20 minutes later, with our food.  Apparently they ran out of glasses.   The food was OK; mine would have been better if it were cooked properly.  There is a big difference between a Medium Rare burger, and a raw-in-the-center burger, and most cooks know the difference.  When you can actually see fibers, and taste the gooey iron in your mouth, it's raw. The other burger was ordered Medium, and was cooked perfectly.  The waitress never came back, so there wasn't a chance to even point out this fact.   When my friend asked for a refill on her lemonade, they apparently ran out of that too.  Then, if the place wasn't crowded enough, someone spilled an entire bucket of soapy water next to, and under our table. Lastly, they will only split checks 50/50, no separate checks.  At least, that is what were were told.  They've never had this issue when I bring my business associates in for lunch and we all want to pay separately.

FINALLY, a new restaurant here in PHX that isn't just like all the others (e.g. The Vig, North, Yard, Windsor, Tuck Stop.....).  This restaurant has both great service, and great food, something that is missing in at ALL the other hipster restaurants that have been popping up over the last few years.  For starters, they accept reservations, even for small parties.  None of this 45 minute wait for mediocre food/service, we barely made it through the door before they were walking us to our table. There was plenty of parking, and no mandatory $ valet.    As you know, service can make or break the meal, and Phillip did an amazing job at entertaining, and informing us.  He could make any of the aforementioned restaurants a palatable place to eat.  His combination of wit and wisdom kept you guessing on what he'd say next.  The bus staff was clearly on-top of everything, as our every needs were met before we realized we needed something.  Our table had: Duck Meatloaf, Short Ribs, Cobia fish dish, Chopped Salad, and Kale Salad.  Everything was perfectly created, cooked, and presented.  It's a bit pricy to be going weekly, but I certainly will be going back monthly.

Immediately upon entering the mostly empty restaurant, we were greeted with "do you have reservations?", not "hello" not "good evening"...  when we indicated that we did not, he said he'll see if he can fit us in somewhere.  we took a seat in the bar as these were apparently the only tables not taken or called for.  Who knows, maybe they had a very large party coming in, or maybe they had a lot of late night reservations.  I started off with a glass of red wine, which was sadly served ice cold, well below the 62-68 range that reds should be served at.  This red was even colder than the 49-55 that whites should be served at, I'm guessing it was in the 40-45 degree range.  it was undrinkable until well after our food had arrived.  I got the shaken wedge salad with chicken and a bowl of tomato bisque - the salad dressing was underwhelming and watery, but the chicken was tasty, as was the bisque.  My date got the chicken sandwich which was also pretty tasty, I decided that I would get this or the Frito sandwich the next time we came in.  The service that night was lacking; maybe they just finished with a crazy rush, maybe they were having a bad day, but it just lacked je ne sais quoi.  The catty server/host who sat us, ended up getting a visitor at the bar who he promptly admired, chatted with, and rubbed on for the last 20 min of our meal.  While my date and I were certainly not offended by their courtship rituals, it certainly isn't behavior one would expect to be publicly displayed by an employee on the clock, in a restaurant, with patrons.  After paying and walking out, we both remarked how empty the restaurant was, and we were left wondering why the big fuss about the reservations.  We both agreed to give it a second chance, as any business is bound to have an off night.  But, after reading Chef MOD, John & Team's review responses, intimidation tactics, and threats of legal action to other reviewers, I don't think so.

I've been here a number of times now, and have yet to be disappointed.  Since it is only a 2 minute walk from my house, it has become my new default restaurant when I don't feel like cooking.  There is enough on the menu to satisfy almost any taste: apps, salads, sandwiches, pizzas, warm plates....  They have a great wine and beer menu, and everything I've had comes out at the right temperature, the right amount of head, in the proper glass.

Perfecto! My partner and I have been returning here on a weekly basis, and have yet to be disappointed.  The meals are delicious and handcrafted, using only the freshest of local ingredients. The menu changes based on ingredients available, so check back often.  The staff here are a cut above the rest, and consistently friendly. The owners are usually very visible, and tends to every detail.  The food is reasonably priced, considering the wholesome quality.

Seems like there are two distinct types of experiences you can have here, good, or very bad.  Ours falls in the very bad category.  After a somewhat cold reception, we were seated and then waited, and waited for our server.  They were out of our choice of beer/wine, so we got water.  I got the Ocotillo Chicken, while my partner got the Asian Dumplings.  My chicken came out luke warm on the outside, ice cold on the parts that were touching the mostly frozen potato salad.  Our waitress never came back after the expediter dropped the plates off, so there wasn't a reasonable way to send this back.  By time she did, it was too late, I was too grossed out.  The Asian Dumplings were flavorful, and hot.
