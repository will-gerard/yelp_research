My first trip to Fast Eddies exceeded my expectations for breakfast at a Diner.  We were greeted as soon as we crossed the threshold by friendly smiling faces and were promptly seated.  The building reminds me of a remodeled Mexican restaurant, but displays bright colors  with assorted "flair" hung on the walls, from humorous placards to framed pictures of locals and their hot rods.  The dining area is split into 2 main rooms one of which has the long bartop eating with stools you'd expect to see at a diner. It was around 9:30 on a Thursday morning, there were plenty of open seats.  As soon as we were sat we placed our drink order and received menus. It's an easy to read one piece laminated menu ala Waffle House. I first noticed that all the breakfast options were affordable on a low budget and they even have daily specials with reduced prices. I'm pretty picky when it comes to breakfast, I don't like pancakes which are usually forced on you as a side. Not at Fast Eddies. You have a choice of pancakes, biscuit and gravy, hashbrowns and toast or fruit. My ideal breakfast includes eggs, a meat item, a potato item, and toast. I could order this dream plate, at Fast Eddies without making any substitutions or paying for sides.  I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs (over medium) ,hashbrowns (topped with cheese is standard) and sour dough toast. It couldn't have even been 5 minutes before our piping hot plates were brought to the table, I was shocked.  Surveying my plate I was pleased to see the corned beef hash was crispy top and bottom and didn't look like a pile of raw hamburger. My eggs were cooked perfectly, solid whites with running yolks. The hashbrowns could have been crisper in my opinion but I'm sure that's something you can request. Two large pieces of soft sourdough toast, was served with fluffy whipped butter and a choice of jellies.  The portions were impressive and my food was delicious, the hash had just the right level of salt and melted in my mouth. I used the last scrap of toast to completely wipe the plate clean. There was no evidence food was served on it. Our waiter handled the payment swiftly and we were in and out in less than a half hour. Each employee we passed on the way out, smiled big and offered a friendly goodbye.  I WILL eat here again, there were multiple menu items I wanted but unfortunately can only put down one plate per visit. Fast Eddies was fast, affordable and delicious.

Being a transplant to AZ, it took sometime of searching and bad hair cuts before I found this place. It is now my go to barber shop.  Electric Haven is in a new location, in the same strip mall, but now in the North West corner by Discount Tire.   The new shop does not currently have any tattoo stations, but I've heard it's something they're working towards, if the zoning codes permit.  The Barber shop is always clean and there are at least 3 barbers there, whenever I've been in.   I've read some reviews griping about a long wait...it's true, sometimes you will wait for some time, but think about what that means.  There are 15 other guys waiting to get their hair cut, because they know and trust the barbers at E/H to do an amazing job. These barbers are very talented, have a reputation of excellence and hey, it's first come, first served.   I know from experience, that some styles and cuts, you can't get at salons, old school barbers, and definitely not at one of those super, fantastic or great hacks.  If you want a razor fade, a hard part, Pompadour, side part, flat top, a flawless fade, slick back, etc. etc. these guys not only will know what you're talking about, but will consult with you on your preferences and leave you walking out with one of the sharpest cuts you've ever had.  In my opinion, that alone is worth any wait. But hey, while you wait, they offer you a cold cup of beer from their very own keg of High Life.  The music is always playing and on my latest visit was happy to hear a whole block of Murder City Devils.  These guys have good taste, are friendly and very talented. It's a screaming deal that these cuts are only 15$.  They also offer beard trims and hot towel shaves for an additional charge.   I've had my hair cut multiple times by Eric and Brendyn and whether it's a new style or a consistent cut I have always been very happy with the outcome. I highly recommend them because they've cut my hair, but all these barbers know their stuff and I've never seen anyone walk out of E/H not grinning and looking sharp.   While you're there pick up a can of High Life pomade, perfect for dressing any hair do. It smells like pina coloda, has a firm hold and a soft shine.

Looking for lunch this afternoon, I decided to try a place I drive by all the time, The Paradise Bakery and Cafe.   As I walked in I saw a large dining area and menus hung on the wall behind different stations. I surveyed the menu and wandered up to the front awaiting direction from one of the many employees standing behind the counter.  I was greeted with  "Soup or Salad?" Confused, I explained I would like to order a half sandwich with a cup of soup. The employee took my sandwich order and then handed me a receipt and directed me down the line for soup service. I carried the paper slip down to the soup section of the cafeteria like presentation line. There, another employee fulfilled my soup request and asked for the paper slip. Handing me my bowl of soup, drink cup and order placard, I was told the total and paid for my lunch. I ordered the Turkey Avocado BLT with a cup of Fire Roasted Tomato soup.  Walking away from the counter I discerned that the employees were neither rude nor friendly, just void of emotion.   As, I filled my drink from the self service station and looked around for a seat I noticed every patron was staring at me like I was unwelcome on their sacred ground. I took a seat at a booth and awaited my sandwich.  Within a few minutes my sandwich was dropped on my table and my number placard taken without an exchange of words. Looking at my recently delivered plate, first thought was the presentation was insulting. It looked like someone tossed the ingredients on the plate and topped it with a piece of bread.  After reassembling the sandwich, I took a bite. Considering it's a bakery, the sour dough was bland and tough, same could be said of the turkey and the bacon was either microwaved or prepackaged. Moving on to the soup, it had more flavor but didn't wow me by any means.   As I finished my meal and looked around I was encompassed by 2 types of patrons, the elderly and suburban hipsters flaunting their Mac Books and tablets and glaring at me.   The highlight for me was the not so terrible chocolate chip cookie that came with my my sandwich. Perhaps the other baked goods are tasty but I'll never know. I won't be back.

Wow! One of the best burgers I've had in Phoenix, and I'm a burger snob!  I never noticed this place, until stuck in traffic today, with a growling belly. Walking into Thirteen North, I could see plenty of seating, a bar and kind of upscale decor, also some sweet 80's jams were playing. I was sat relatively quickly and brought a menu and my drink order.  Glancing at the menu, there were so many items that made me salivate, but I decided to focus on the burgers. All unique takes on the traditional hamburger, including the Pizza Burger with pepperoni, smoked mozzarella and marinara. I decided on the Hot Mess burger, an Angus beef patty crowned with jalapeno cheddar sauce, fried jalapenos and crispy fried onion strings. For the included side, I chose sweet potato fries.  When my plate arrived it was massive, my burger overflowing with tasty toppings. A stack of fresh pickles, red onion, tomato and shredded lettuce sat beside the burger. A generous portion of perfectly cooked sweet potato fries with a chili sauce (made in house) nestled in the midst of it all.  First I dove into the sweet chilli sauce with a fry, it was amazing, full of flavor not heat, and paired the sweet potato blissfully. Next a bite of the burger, the cheddar sauce was tasty, the crispy jalapeno had great texture and the onion straws made for a prefect crunch before sinking into a very flavorful Angus patty.   I cleaned my plate and sat with a very full belly while talking to my friendly server Wayne. The portion was large and all that for under 10$ a great value. Honestly I can't wait to be hungry again so I can try something else. They have delicious looking appetizers, chicken and steak wraps and complete dinner options as well.   Well done Thirteen North, truly a hidden gem amongst a rotting strip mall.

I'm so happy I found Tempe Trophy!   I was on a mission to have a single letter engraved on a small brass padlock.  I started at Things Remembered, they wanted an 18$ fee for bringing in my own item.  I visited 8 other engraving shops around the valley, who either wanted large set up fees or straight up refused to engrave my piece.   I called over to Tempe Trophy and spoke to a delightful woman, who not only told me she'd be happy to engrave my item, but that they'd do it for a minimal fee.    When I arrived at the shop on the corner of Baseline and Ash, I was greeted with a smile.  She took the time to engrave sample fonts and a sheet of brass, and we both came to an agreement on font that best suited my needs.    I dropped off my lock and came back the next day to pick it up.  I'm delighted at the result! It's beautiful, engraved with a diamond, and was under 15$ total.    If you have any engraving, trophy, or plaque needs, this is the place to go.  The showroom is full of unique and custom designs.    Tempe Trophy came through, when I was beginning to lose hope.  Thank you so much!
