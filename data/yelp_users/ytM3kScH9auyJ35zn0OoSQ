After frequentlng Cafe ZuZu's awesome happy hour many times, I decided to book a staycation over the Labor Day weekend. Every person we encountered on the hotel staff were extremely friendly and gracious, from the valet to the front desk to housekeeping. We love the look and vibe of this retro hotel, and the room we had was gorgeous as well. Very mod and different than the standard old boring room that you tend to get with every other hotel.   The only thing that initially gave me pause was that upon check-in, we were informed that there was going to be a big pool party on Saturday (YAY), but that this was only for hotel guests (BOO). Anyone attending that was not a guest of the hotel would be charged a $25 admission. This was a bit upsetting, as we'd already invited a few of our local friends to come and lounge around the pool with us on Saturday. However, upon speaking with the front desk about this the next day, they handed us free admission passes for our friends to come to the pool with us, no questions asked.   I was also pleasantly surprised with how affordable it was to order drinks and food at the pool. I was expecting Vegas-like prices (AKA $14 per cocktail), but was very happy to see that you could order cocktails for $6, and buckets of beer for $15.   Overall, the look, vibe, price, value and service were all higher than expected, and we'd book another stay at the Hotel Valley Ho no questions asked!

I consider myself a foodie. That being said, I LOVE it when you get extra bang for your buck. Which is why I absolutely love Stax. Everything that I've ever eaten here has been delicious, and I've tried almost everything on the menu, from their more traditional beef and turkey burgers, to their mac & cheese, to the smothered tots to the hummus to the wedge salad. Everything tastes fresh, delicious and tends to have an unexpected flavor profile or twist.   Their red sangria is my go-to, although they are stocked with great beers as well.   Happy hour values are incredible.   Marshall, one of the bartenders, is extremely friendly and will remember your name and your menu favs after just a couple visits. His customer service is superb.

I'm going to keep this short and sweet - The Breadfruit is absolutely delicious. One of the best meals I've ever had, anywhere in AZ, hands down. We had the Appleton Rum Sea Scallops as our appetizer, which were the best scallops I've ever tasted. Very spicy and very flavorful. I had the jerked chicken as my entree, and my boyfriend had the jerked pork. Both were excellent.  Loved the space, loved the vibe, service was great, loved the drinks, LOVED the food. I can't wait to go back.

This is my favorite spot for happy hour in Scottsdale, if not PHX as a whole. Their drinks are well thought-out and made with love. They have the BEST Old Fashioned that I've ever had - a must order, while you're here.   Their food is always delicious, too. Order the grilled cheese. Scratch that - order 2 of them. I promise you'll be glad you did.   The only reason I can't give them 5 stars right now is simply because of inconsistent service. Some evenings you'll have the best waitstaff or bartender ever, and other times you'll feel invisible. Fingers crossed that you get a good waiter/bartender (which does happen about 7/10 times) and you won't be disappointed. The few times I've had bad service didn't feel malicious, though. The waitresses simply seemed scatterbrained. I sorta just wanted to pat them on the head and say "Aw, at least you're pretty".  All in all, a great spot that I'd highly recommend checking out!

I've been to RnR about 4 times total, including on their opening night. Service has always been an issue - their staff seems to care a lot more about socializing and primping themselves than they do about actually waiting on their clientelle. The food is alright, I can't say that there's anything special or memorable about any of their dishes. It's just glammed up bar food - nothing that tastes any better or worse than the 10+ restaurants around Scottsdale that have the exact same concept. The breaking point for me was when I ate a chicken sandwich here one night, and came down with the most awful food poisoning that I've ever experienced. 3 days of excrutiating stomach pain and not being able to keep anything down was the straw that broke the camel's back for me about RnR - I will never return here.

First a little about me - I am not a loud person, nor have I ever been disciplined, kicked out of or otherwise asked to leave any establishment. I would prefer a quiet bar where I can converse with my friends over a club any day.   Now about my experience at Ernie's - I came to support a friend who was participating in a karaoke contest on a Tuesday night. About 20 minutes into said competition, the female "judge" made a point to shame myself and the people I was sitting with for laughing (quietly and amongst ourselves, not at any participant), said it was "distracting" to her and made a comment about waiting to "have fun later". Wow. I had no idea that talking and laughing amongst friends at a dive bar was something to be publicly scolded for. Now so you don't think that I'm just overly upset from a personal, one-off situation - Several other times throughout the evening, this karaoke staff made a point to get on the mics and tell the patrons of the bar to be quiet, and at one point the man acting as the DJ even told everyone in the bar to "shut the hell up". Mind you, NO ONE was talking above normal bar chatter. Not a single person that night had been overly loud, or rude, or obnoxious or harassing, which are the only situations I can appropriately deem to speak up and say something.   I have to assume that the entire reason that this karaoke contest exists is to get more people to come into Ernie's and drive business. So then, why is the staff then acting like these very patrons are unruly children who need to be disciplined and scolded? This was an awful experience and I don't foresee ever coming back.

I had never tried Pilates before, but after trying out IM=X Pilates Phoenix via a Groupon, I was hooked and signed up for a year membership here. I should also note that I live in East Mesa, but it's completely worth it to me to attend classes here.  I love the fact that I get a full-body workout every time I come in, and the hour-long classes fly by. I feel stronger, more flexible and calmer, and I actually look forward to my workouts. The studio is clean and welcoming, and the women who work here are all extremely friendly and knowledgeable. I never felt like the "newbie" or out of place.   Besides Pilates, the studio also offers TRX, barre and yoga classes. All of which are great and all of which will kick your butt in the best way possible.

I have been a registered donor with The World Egg Bank since 2012, and have completed 4 donor cycles with them. The women I have worked with at TWEB have always been extremely kind, considerate, appreciative and timely with me. Any questions I have ever had - from very general to very specific - were always addressed within a day (and usually within an hour or two). Many of the women on their staff have also been egg donors themselves, so it was wonderful being able to hear from women who were able to give me real-life answers, rather than "corporate" answers.  I felt like TWEB was very conscious of my well-being, and I was always compensated immediately after I completed a donor cycle (Becky, my coordinator, always sent me a same-day email making sure that the donor procedure went alright and confirming that my check was in the mail).   I had to travel to another state to complete my first donor cycle, and Becky was great about arranging my travel plans. The donor companion they sent me with was knowledgeable, sensitive and caring. In response to one woman's Yelp complaint that TWEB does not pay for a friend or relative to travel with the donor - While I can understand that having a friend/family member with you can provide a certain sense of ease and moral, I have to completely side with TWEB on their policy of providing an experienced donor companion. My companion was wonderful, and the fact that she had already been an experienced donor companion in the exact state/city/hospital that I had to travel to put me at ease. Traveling to another state to complete a donor procedure is not a "vacation", and thusly I much prefer to have an experienced individual with me over a friend.   I would recommend The World Egg Bank to any woman thinking about becoming an egg donor. Giving back in such a personal way has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and TWEB was great every step of the way.

Hands down, the best music venue in all of AZ. They have a constant flow of amazing bands and artists, their food is delicious (you can't go wrong with a burrito conceptualized and created from the chef/owner of Pizzeria Bianco), their drinks are poured and priced right, and the staff is typically very friendly. Sound quality during the shows is always right on, and the space itself is really nice. Definitely not dingy or a dirty hole-in-the-wall like a few other PHX music venues.  The only downside I can think of is that parking can be an issue. Try to get there early and you won't have to drive around looking for a space too long.

We went to Crudo for the first time to have a few drinks, upon reading a review in a local Phoenix magazine dubbing their cocktails some of the best in Phoenix. We were not disappointed! The cocktails may take a couple minutes longer to get, but it's because their friendly bartenders are VERY meticulously creating your drink. My date and I each had 3 different cocktails, each of which were delicious. I would go back in a heartbeat.

We went back to Crudo for another visit, this time to try the food. Oh. My God. Run, don't walk, to have a meal there. Incredible. The boyfriend and I each did the 3 items for $35, and between tasting each others' plates, we were absolutely thrilled and stuffed. I can't wait to go back again.

Delicious. I'd write about what I've eaten at America's Taco Shop, but it would take much less time to list what I haven't eaten!  Some of my favs - Both the carne asada and al pastor tortas are mouthwatering. And their bean & cheese burritos are as good as it gets. Try the one with diced fresh jalapenos added for an additional $0.25. I also crave their guacamole. Definitely try their conchata - iced coffee and horchata mixed together.   The only downside - don't come here with friends if you're looking to have a conversation. You'll all be shoving food in your mouths too fast to be able to talk.

I decided to give this place a try, but unfortunately did not get a chance to partake. After waiting for 15 minutes in the drive-thru line that never moved (literally) I decided to call a spade a spade and left. At other "upscale" drive-thrus (see D'lish), if their drive-thru line is long, a staff member comes out to your car to take and/or deliver your order. The Stand could learn a thing or two about improving their customer service.

Short review: Awful service, awful drinks. Super long wait at the non-crowded bar while I had the pleasure of watching the male bartender flirt with the female waitstaff for over 5 minutes. No acknowledgement or apologies from the staff for severely sub-par service.   Detailed review: The service is just plain awful. I've been a few times now before deciding to finalize my opinion and write a review, and after my last visit this past weekend I'm compelled to warn people to stay away if you're looking for a place with anything resembling even mediocre service. I stood at the bar (dead center, with no one standing in front of me) for over 5 minutes before the bartender even took my order. It was not busy, and there is no excuse for the wait - I had to watch the male bartender flirt and laugh with the female waitstaff the entire time. He never made eye contact or even bothered to acknowledge my presence the entire time I waited. When he finally came over, it was after he took the order and brought beers for the guy who stood next to me, and had only just recently ponied up to the bar about a minute previously. When I finally got my drink order (a very simple whisky cocktail and a draught PBR) the cocktail ended up being one of the worst I've ever had in my life. I don't understand how someone could mess up a simple cocktail so badly - I even asked a few friends to try it to make sure I wasn't overreacting. Their disgusted looks after they each took a sip proved me right. My experiences at this place in the past were warning enough, but after this last visit I will never go back.

JC called me about a week before I went in, and left a message stating that they were looking to buy back some of their previous inventory, and would work to get me into a new vehicle at the same monthly payment. I messaged him back that my current Mazda 3 (which I'd purchased from Cardinale Way 3 years prior) had a cracked windshield, a dent in the passenger side, and also had already passed 80k miles, so I didn't think they'd be interested in buying it back. JC still wanted me to come in, so I agreed to an appointment a few days later. JC was very courteous throughtout our appointment, and worked to get me into a newer, much more well-equipped Mazda 3 while only using my trade-in and no down payment. My finance manager Todd was also very nice, and worked to get me a great warrany at a fair price as well. JC personally delivered my new car to my place of work the next day, and also checked in on me a few days later as a courtesy. I also received a call from Todd a few days after my purchase date, stating that he'd taken it upon himself to work with my financing a bit more (even though I'd already signed all the contracts) and was able to lower my monthly payment by another $20 a month and overall cost by over $2200.   I was very pleased to have worked with two gentlemen who came acrossed as patient, honest and went above and beyond what I expected from them from a service standpoint. And as a female purchasing a car (yes, I went alone, no man to chauffer or assist), I never felt harassed, patronized or taken advantage of.   Thank you Cardinale Way!

It makes me really upset to have to write this follow up review, but in light of recent events my opinion of this dealership has completely changed, and I no longer feel comfortable recommending this place.   So the scenario is, I purchased my most recent vehicle from Cardinale Way in August 2012. On April 13, 2013, I received a letter from a law firm stating that they had been contracted by Cardinale Way as debt collectors for an outstanding debt I owe the dealership. In looking over the paperwork they sent me, this "outstanding debt" is a $300 down payment that the dealership was suppossed to automatically deduct from my checking account the week after I purchased my car. Keyword here being "automatically". Apparently they never did this, and this entire time I've owned be car (8 months now) the dealership has never contacted or notified me that this debit never occurred.   On top of everything, it is now 2 weeks later since having recieved this letter, and absolutely no one from the dealership has contacted me back to resolve this matter. I have left a voicemail with accounts receivable, left my issue on their Facebook page (to which someone commented, but they never actually called me to resolve the issue like they said they would) and I even called and spoke with their GM (who said he would get right on the issue and would call me back - it's now a week and a half later and nothing).   Apparently no one at this dealership feels the need to be accountable for their customer's experience once they've sold them the car.   I will not be returning to this dealership with my business, nor will I ever recommend them again.
