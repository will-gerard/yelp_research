The tortillas will make up for anything bad you may encounter.  You could put gerbil in one of those things and I'd gobble it up.

How can you mess up a franchise? This Sonic will show you how!  I live within walking distance and have been there way too many times out of sheer laziness and every time I get what I deserve for stupidly going back.  You have about a 10% chance of the stoned teen on guard (they're rotated out weekly it seems) getting your order right and then you get to spend 10 minutes trying to correct it with them and another 10 with the disgruntled manager dragged over after much head scratching.  Honestly out of the two dozen times I've been there they got my order right once, i actually went home, did a little dance and bought a lottery ticket that night.

Breakfast is pretty much breakfast, but there are more combinations of those staple 5 ingredients here than at most eggjoints.  The inside is country cutesy and clean.  There's an outside patio but its small and the sun always seems to hit you right in the eyes no matter when you're out there.   The healthy items dont taste bad which makes the place a keeper.   Only open until early afternoon, but hey its better than Dennys.

So I've always called this place Awful House, and really it aint that bad.   For some reason I thought it would be like an extra ghetto Dennys with more roaches and surly teenagers, but it was spotless and ruckus-free.   The waitress seemed happy to have people ordering more than just coffee and was pretty attentive, especially for a diner.  Good selection for a late nite menu. Im always down for late night eats and now this is one more place to try when the city is too hot to venture out in during the day.

Best Hawaiian in town, this place was a staple for me in the college years.  I could live off the manapua.  The humble decor leaves you in for an even better surprise when you taste the food.  Had a friend that lived in Hawaii for several years and he said the food here was just like home.  They have music on some days and advertise cultural events happening in the valley.  Fun, cheap, good eats.

The best place to get those hard to find Asian items along with standard staples.  Big selection and good (sometimes unbelievable) prices.   It can be a bit hard to find things and don't expect for help in english.

Eh, its a big store full of pre packaged pool care items so the products are fine, but for the love of all things good and holy please go to another Leslie's to buy your backyard water hole supplies!  The customer service at this place is astounding, and not in the gives you warm fuzzies way.  The sales folk will flat out lie to you about the products they sell either out of commission lust or utter bewilderment about the items in the store and how they work.  I recently went in to buy a $200+ piece of equipment with one and only one question: Does this unit have parts that I will need to replace at certain time intervals (ie every year) and was assured up and down with a little tap dance that no Ma'am, the price you pay now is all you'll pay for this lovely thing, it slices, it dices, it makes Julian eggo margaritas!  Well when I get the thing home the manual states that I can expect $50 a year in replacement proprietary battery packs and sensors, but the thing was written in English and not slimy sales-ees so perhaps he just thought the included paper was a napkin and wiped his drool with it rather than actually reading it.  Against my better judgement I go back today for some chemicals and ended up leaving with nothing except a vague feeling I should be glad I wasn't sent to my room.  After wandering the store for about 10 minutes and watching the clerk watch tv in the back I finally find half of what I'm looking for and pace back and forth in front of his hideout hoping he'll get the hint and ring me up.  When he finally glances up he makes the mistake of asking if I need anything else... and hey I do, so what better time to speak up!  I tell him I need some pool conditioner, and he suggests I bring in a water sample.  While the store is not infested with roaches or naked babies or drug cartel mafia it's still not exactly what I'd call my type of hangout, and if I can avoid spending my free time chumming it up at Leslie's I'd like to, so I let him know I'd just like to know where they keep the stuff.  Still, with a strong father knows best Daddy Pool Pro tells me I'm not quite ready for that information and he'll tell me what I need to know when I'm older (and bring in a water sample).  I've always heard that the third time is a charm so I give it another go, this time relenting that a poor misinformed lass like myself probably shouldn't buy this product I came in to buy, but golly gee I sure would at least like to know the name of the stuff so maybe when I'm not barefoot in the kitchen I can learn me some about it.  Luckily my weakness for knowledge was detected by my hero and Daddy swooped in to save the day again with the reassurance in his voice almost as palpable as a patronizing pat on the head. No No dear, Don't worry your pretty little head about it.  At that point I told dad I didnt need to borrow the car that night, and he could expect to be put in a cheap retirement home in mexico for his golden years. ;)  Really tho folks, treating your paying customers like children and withholding information about your products is the quickest way to bolster your database of ex-customers.  It would help if your employees knew a bit about the products they sell and didn't overtly lie to make a quick buck, but with service like this place has I'm guessing they have a lot more to worry about.

i'm often stuck at 2am craving something, and with Bosa if its donuts I dont have to go to bed grumpy and disappointed.  They corner the late night market and still put forth the effort to make the donuts fantastic.  You can get ice cream and other treats here as well, with a drive thru window for the ultra lazy.

This place has one of the classiest atmospheres in tempe.  The food is upscale and priced so, yet more on the "classics" end rather than new and innovative flavors.  The service is usually stellar when I go yet the one time I try to show my parents how nice this spot is we end up leaving due to being forgotten for 45 minutes.  If you go on a good waiter day and sit outside in the spring this place can make your evening.

I went to "the best pizza restaurant in phoenix" and this place blew it away in taste, atmosphere, service, and price.  The place is decently roomy yet still cozy with the pizza oven in the background glowing.  The menu has a nice selection and everything I've had there has been fresh and tasty.  They have some unusual alcohols there we cant find anywhere else and I always enjoy their espresso after dinner.  Really pleasantly surprised by this place as it doesn't look like much from the location.

Wong's is fast, friendly, tasty and easy on the wallet.  Nothing fancy but consistently good.

The BEST Filibertos, and I've eaten at them all as well as the *berto clones.  The meat never tastes like cat unlike at some of them and it's open 24 hours, inside too!  The condiment bar is always stocked with fresh peppers, tomatoes, salsa, guacamole, etc and they actually get my orders right first try.  If you do go late you may encounter a line at the drive through because it's a hoppin place after everything else closes.

Unlike the previous reviewer I dont think my attitude had anything to do with my bad experience.   I think it had more to do with half (of the already skimpy menu) being sold out by the time we were finally seated.  During our 3 hour wait (which we planned for) one of our group of six had to walk back to the car (parked almost a mile away due to there being no where else to park) to get their medication.  Of course we were called to the table when they were 2 blocks away and even though we had 5 out of 6 people and swore the last was walking here that very moment they said we would have to wait.  Less than 2 minutes later the last person arrived and we let the hostess know and then waited another 45 minutes and watched her seat 4 other tables before us as if to show us just who was running the show around here.  We pretty much had to order what was left on the menu after playing the "we're out of that" game with the waiter 4X and when the food finally did come I was hungry enough to think play-doh spaghetti was a delicacy.  It wasn't particularly bad.  The ingredients were fresh enough, but it just wasn't nearly anything special enough to warrant the hassle.  I'm only reviewing this place tonight because I just came from Christopher's and had a pizza that puts this place to shame for about the same price and a fraction of the snobbery.

Oooh, I forgot about the bar next door, that made the whole experience rival a root canal!  When we first arrived we sat at the claustrophobia inducing bar for at least 10 minutes while the bartender had a lengthy conversation with the girl sitting behind me about high school.  When she finally did get around to acknowledging me ( I had been sitting 2 feet from her and maintaining creepy stalker eye contact for way too long trying to get her attention) she was flabbergasted that I asked what kind of cider they had.  "Uuuuuh APPLE?" she said rolling her eyes and doing her best valley girl impression.  I guess no one ever told her they make other kinds, but they should have told her snotty little bartenders don't get tips.  Some of my group were *gasp* smokers and during the hours long stint at the bar went outside to smoke.  The bartender actually came out and told us we had to be 20 feet away from the door, ok no problem, except we were already over 20 feet from the door.  So we asked where we should stand, and she pointed to a spot 12 inches from where we were.  a foot? Come on, power trip much?  What ever happened to snobbery being earned by actually having a worthwhile product?  Now it just seems places are rude to customers to create the air of importance without having the substance to back it up.  Too tragically hip for its own good.

Camelview has been bringing foreign and independent films to the valley long before it was a hip trend.  The theater might be a little run down, but its staffed with true movie lovers happy to be there.  There are 5 screens so you tend to get more stuff running here than the average one screen indie moviehouse.  They show an excellent mix of films you'd have to hunt down otherwise, and the location is very convenient if you want to do something before or after your movie.

Gelato 64 has one of the biggest selection of flavors that I've seen anywhere in the valley.  I go here especially for some of the weird combinations I don't see elsewhere.  As for price, I'd say it was slightly above average but not much, and they send out coupons frequently that make up for the increase.  The quality is pretty good, I've never had an icey chunk and the portions are just right.

My favorite sushi restaurant in the valley.  I don't think I've ever had the Korean bbq there because I'm always at the sushi bar.  The fish always tastes fresh, the price is good, really good if you do the all you can eat menu.  Its really rare to find a place with better service and this place has the absolute best, nicest, most charming sushi chef in town.  The owner makes a point to remember his customers and often chats among them.    Even if you were disappointed with the bbq I'd highly suggest giving the sushi side a try.

As far as valley bark parks go this one is at the top.  Huge facility with several different areas to make everyone happy.  There's an enclosed area designated for more timid dogs which is fantastic if your pup is new to the dog park thing.  Another fenced area has good sized lake for pooches to take a dip in and play on the "beach" while the last enclosed space has some agility equipment and a lot of running room.  There's also a playground for kids and some bbq's for the fur-less park participants.   We go a bunch and the disrespectful folks have been a rarity.  Its tru tho that a lot of owners dont pick up after their pooches so watch out for doo.

This was my primary vet for years but I've since switched due to some unscrupulous practices. Firstly I had a ferret I was fairly sure had adrenal cancer due to having had other ferrets with the disease before. I know not all vets are equipped to deal with this so I specifically asked if she could be treated for the cancer at this facility and was told yes. Once I got there and paid the $50 exam fee I was told she probably had adrenal cancer and they couldn't treat her there. Lying to customers is never good. Then after my new puppy came down with a cold they tried to push Xrays on me even after they admitted their course of treatment would be no different should I get the xray or not. When I again refused the xray they made me sign a guilt laden form stating that I had repeatedly denied their medical advice and anything happening to my pet was my fault. Another time I waited over an hour past my appointment time for vaccinations. Other times the staff has been polite but I dont really like being lied to, guilt tripped, and treated like my time is unimportant.

Where else are you going to get sushi at 1am, and good sushi for that matter?  Wonderful food, staff, atmosphere, everything! With lots of variety in both the food and drink selection I love this place and visit frequently.

I'm really torn on this one.  On one hand you've got one of the only places in town to see rare/indie films and live shows, on the other you have the room filling egos of the staff and patrons knowing this is one of the only places in town to see this stuff.  Should you even mention in a voice barely above a whisper to your direct companions a comment about a movie more then 10 people have seen be prepared for know-it-alls to pop up like some demented whack a mole game lecturing about the evils of hollywood and how they're much more enlightened and into film than you are having actually SEEN Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story.  (I really wish I was exaggerating for effect here folks, but the superstar comment actually happened) While I really do appreciate having more variety in film which Chandler Cinemas certainly provides what they need to realize is that its a theater; a place where people to go see movies for entertainment, not some awesome flying unicorn that beams cancer curing rainbows from its rear.

Amazingly impressed with the customer service here.  I had been to 4 other stores to buy a new pricey appliance and left each time because the sales staff were rude or didn't know about their products.   Stopped by this store and I felt like I was dreaming it was so easy especially compared to the competition.  They not only price matched the other stores lower prices but threw in free shipping.  Staff answered all the questions the other guys couldn't and everything went off without a hitch.   Who knows if the rest of this store is this good as I dont often shop here, but way to go to the appliance folks!

One of the only places I can get orijen locally.  The owner is friendly and knowledgeable and the store is always well organized and clean.  The hours can be a little strange but the selection and prices make up for it.

Went here for a birthday and it did the trick for a nice restaurant with a special occasion environment.  They've modernized it from the old location and added some new items to the menu.  I got teased for ordering a pizza at such a fancy place at first but by the end of the night everyone agreed the duck, goat cheese and fig pizza was the best dish of the night.  Service was excellent and while the portions aren't huge they're not laughable miniatures either.  Good place that has been around for a long time yet keeps evolving.

Nice little restaurant.  The portions are ample for the price and the meat was well cooked, not dry like some other gyros.   The staff were friendly and the decor, bright and clean.

Wow, I've been living next to this place for a few months and I've been missing out.  Its mostly English fare, sometimes with a twist.  I'm a pasty fan and was scoffing about how the crust would be all wrong and the shepherds pie would be made with beef, etc, but I had to eat my words (I wasn't wearing a hat).  Everything was perfect and the sauce was fantastic!  One of our orders got messed up a bit but we got some freebies on the house that made up for it.  Lots of good draft beer, and even a tasty draft cider I hadn't tried before.  The staff was great, helpful and friendly without being too clingy, and my glass never went empty.   I'll be back for sure.
