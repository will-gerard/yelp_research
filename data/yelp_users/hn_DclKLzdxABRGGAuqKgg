I don't usually write reviews for chains but this Domino's was bad, even for "fast food pizza" standards. Way too greasy, and it was definitely stale, old grease. Ended up throwing half the pizza out because it just tasted so bad. Cheese only was edible, but anything we had with toppings was bad. Not coming back.

Weak 4. Very pretty restaurant, nice staff and ample parking space behind the restaurant. The sake cosmo is really good. The freshie rolls are excellent - I love the chicken and shrimp combo, the fresh mint, and the delicious peanut sauce. I thought the Kao Pad Jay was really good - the tofu was cooked well, and the rice was really rich and delicious. The vegetables in the dish were room temperature and cooler relative to the rice, so I'm wondering if they used frozen veggies rather than fresh (or maybe a combo). Good, but not sure I would get it again. The pad thai was yummy and beautifully plated. I can see myself coming back.

This is a very interesting, very informative museum. The architecture of the building is beautiful and simply adds to the extensive, well displayed exhibits. I was a little disappointed that a good amount of the art on display is modern (made in the last 4 decades or so), and that there were only a few exhibits with art from several hundred years ago (the rest of the exhibits are from the 19th century), but this is minor.  I definitely recommend stopping by at least once to visit. I can see myself coming back again.

Great zoo. I think admission is reasonably priced. It's really large, with a good amount of shade along the paths. Exhibits are well maintained and displayed; it's nice to get so close up to various exotic birds and small animals. I think the membership is the way to go; you get early admission (8 AM vs 9 AM) in addition to unlimited admission for a year. It's really nice to stop in for an hour to an hour and a half, take a look, and then return at your convenience to tour the rest of the zoo. It's also really great that you can bring in your own food and drinks in a bag; save yourself some money and bring some water! Can't wait to see Zoo Lights.

Eh... no. This bright colorful restaurant is kind of cute, but the food leaves much to be desired.  The cheese crisp should be skipped. It's a fried tortilla covered in Velveeta (or some other processed cheese). There's no flavor. Salsa tastes like it's made from canned tomatoes. Chips were fresh, on the plus side.  I think the entrees were better. Chicken chimichanga was OK. The rice was fine, too. Carne asada tacos had a decent tomatillo sauce, but the beef was tough. Black beans seemed canned, but the mixed vegetables were actually pretty good and well seasoned.  Prices were high relative to the food you receive. I don't think I'll be back.

Pane Bianco is a refreshing breath of air.  After having a bad experience at Pizzeria Bianco, I was pretty hesitant to try Pane. My husband talked me into going, and I'm really glad that he did. Restaurant is located next to Lux, so parking is shared (either the small lot next to/behind the building or along the street).  I really like the decor. The seating is mostly large tables with chairs and benches. It's dimly lit, with a small bar and a separate to-go section. Menu is small but sufficient and good. I like that you can order a pizza in addition to trying something a little different from Pizzeria.  Eggplant parmigiana is lovely. It's small but rich, with a wonderfully crisp topping and rich eggplant inside. I like that it isn't bogged down in marinara and cheese. The honey lemon chicken is amazing. The chicken is extremely tender, and the accompanying apple slaw and potato salad are refreshing and delicious. The plating is very rustic, which I like.  Service was good. We had a great time. I can't wait to stop in and try lunch sometime.

George & Dragon! After driving by you for months, I finally decided to stop in. Very nice!  Well, pretty nice. Maybe just nice. The four star rating is very weak, but I decided to bump up from 3 to 4 because we had a good time. I like that this place is low key and not pretentious. I like that on Sundays, they play different football games rather than just focusing on the Cardinals. And I like that they host different things, like live music and trivia nights.  The food is very bland. However, it's a bar, so expecting the meal of your life is a little silly. It isn't greasy, bad bar food; it's average and a little overpriced. I would stick to a simple appetizer and some drinks in the future.  Fish and chips were OK - the corn was definitely frozen, and I think the fish may have been as well. Burger was very simple and bland. I did like the thick cut fries, but they were probably frozen as well. Portions were pretty good, which is a plus.  The service was OK. A little lackluster - our server seemed a bit frazzled, and she was the only one working the dining room. There were several tables that hadn't been cleared of the dirty dishes after the customers had left, so seating was limited based on that. The restaurant isn't dirty, but it isn't immaculate, either.  I can definitely see why people wouldn't like this place, but for me, it's close to home, and it's a good place to relax without being around a huge crowd. If you stop in, don't expect too much, and you'll (hopefully) be pleasantly surprised like my husband and I were.

This candy shop makes me nostalgic. When you walk in, it feels like the staff have worked there since they were teenagers and they've preserved their enthusiasm and excitement for the candy for years. They greet you loudly, happily, and they offer you samples. What better way to start a shopping trip?  There's a few counters with preboxed items, and there's a fresh counter where you can pick out which candies you'd like. The apricot delight is very interesting and very sweet. It's a nice change of pace from the typical fruit candies. Milk chocolate strawberry cream was better than I thought it would be - perfectly balanced sweetness with the chocolate. Peanut butter pattie was nothing to write home about - I might skip it in the future. Same goes for the milk chocolate coconut. Dark chocolate chip truffle is very rich and very good and just the right portion size.  Prices are great. We got 4 truffles for less than $3. In terms of quality, it's hard to beat. I wouldn't mind stopping in again.

Yummy! Veggie egg rolls are excellent - really interesting, complex flavor. Egg flower soup is full of vegetables and is a lot heartier than I expected.  Lemon chicken is pretty good - not terribly exciting, but not bad by any means. The ma po tofu is really good with a nice, spicy kick.  I'll definitely give China Chili another go round and try out other menu items.

Interesting! I've had this place bookmarked for months but the parking lot is always swamped so I get impatient and leave. I was finally able to make it in.  The restaurant is decorated like an Italian restaurant, and the menu even features a few Italian dishes. The staff are really nice, and our server was super attentive even when the restaurant got full.  We tried the jap chae as an appetizer and it was wonderful. The beef was tender and full of wonderful flavor. The potato noodles were thin and delicious.The yakisoba tofu was slightly sweet, with a big portion and lots of well cooked tofu. It was awesome. Pad thai with chicken was simple but well done.  I definitely want to come back, especially for happy hour. I wish I hadn't taken so long to stop in!

Had such a great time here. Plazma has a dive bar feel (as least when I went). Cocktails were cheap and strong. The bartender was so nice and friendly and worked his butt off all night - he did a great job.  I like the little outdoor seating area, and there's a good amount of parking. Overall, very chill, very nice.

I am from Texas and I do love the regional food. My husband had been craving a good chicken fried steak, so we decided to try TEXAZ Grill.  The parking can be a pain. If you pull into the spots right in front of the building, they're for compact cars, and there's no valet. There is a lot behind the building with ample sized spots, so look for the turn in off Bethany Home.  The decor is a little tacky and over the top, but I guess that adds to the restaurant's charm. The staff is friendly and helpful.  Chicken fried steak - awesome. The portion is huge, and it's cooked just like it should be. Accompanying mashed potatoes are quite good. I was surprised that the brisket sandwich was so good. The meat is really tender, flavorful, and thick cut. I like that they top it with BBQ sauce and then provide extra on the side. Portion was also big, although the chicken fried steak is hard to beat in terms of quality, quantity, and price. My husband and I could have split it and still had leftovers.  We had plenty of leftovers and couldn't try any dessert (unfortunately) because we were so full. I really want to go back and try the other menu items, like the chili, one of their many steaks, and the chicken fried chicken. If you like Texas staples, give TEXAZ Grill a try.

Good selection, well stocked, and fairly reasonable prices. I like the food and wine sections best - lots of my favorite British desserts, candies, and chocolates at decent prices. Also a good place to go if you need to find a gift for someone but you're not sure what to get.

Very nice. We entered through the back door, which had us pass through the kitchen, past the bar, and up to the host stand. Restaurant is tastefully decorated with lots of comfortable seating.  The crispy eggplant sandwich is wonderful. The eggplant is definitely crisp, not soggy, and the accompanying goat cheese is just the right amount of creamy, rich texture and flavor without weighing the sandwich down. The sweet potato fries are also seasoned perfectly.  The chipotle BBQ burger is really good. The onion rings on the burger are fantastic, but the overall burger is a little too salty for my personal taste. Still, it was very nice, and the french fries are good.  Service was pretty good. We had a nice time and I think we'll definitely be back.

Small buffet with some OK dishes. I thought the chick peas were cooked well and flavored nicely. The chicken curry was spicy but executed poorly. The rice in the buffet line was old. The fresh naan was nice but we were ready to leave by the time they brought it to our table, which made the meal all the more sad. Not coming back.

This is one of the nicest Williams-Sonoma stores I've seen in terms of how the merchandise is set up. The store is clean and immaculate. Everything is so well organized, and it isn't too cluttered. The people who work there aren't the friendliest, but it's such a well displayed store (and it's so close to me) that I'll go back.  If you're looking for high quality cookware and bakeware, or maybe some specialty food items, definitely give Williams-Sonoma a try. It's pricey, but the products are excellent.

Beautiful restaurant, with a friendly staff. Extensive selection of wine, and reasonably priced beer. I'm a big fan of the happy hour specials.  The bruschetta is delicious. My personal favorite is red bell peppers with goat cheese. I really like that you can pick for different toppings for a single serving - it's a great way to sample all the different types of bruschetta. The bellinis are also really good if you're not in a beer or wine mood.  I really need to go back and try more of the menu. Can't wait!

Small, clean shop with very nice staff. I grew up on Baskin-Robbins; I feel like a little kid whenever I get a scoop of their ice cream (especially chocolate chip). If I'm in the area again I'll definitely stop in.

Stopped in for lunch. Restaurant is large; it's hard to imagine there being much of a wait during prime dinner times. The staff is friendly and attentive, but the food... not so much.  Chips are fine; salsa is OK, and you also get a small bowl of warm refried beans. Prices are fair in regards to portion size. I do like that the vegetables they use are very fresh; I hate getting veggie enchiladas, etc. that use frozen, poorly cooked vegetables. The zucchini was fresh, crisp, and pretty good. The rice and beans were too salty in my opinion. Food was average at best.  Definitely not the best Mexican food I've had; I am surprised at the high rating. However, service was good (our drinks were never empty, and we didn't have to ask for a refill on chips). The server also asked about how we wanted our check split, which helped avoid a lot of hassle.  Not sure if I'll be back, but definitely not a bad experience by any means. Just not my kind of food.

Heaven. Seriously, this is the place to go if you want to pamper yourself.  A couple of friends and I purchased the Groupon deal posted a couple months back. We got full facials and spent the rest of the morning relaxing by the pool. The staff is very helpful, and since we were first timers, we appreciated the directions they gave us.  The spa is beautiful, and I love the variety of teas and little goodies. The facial was amazing and super relaxing. I wish I brought my swimsuit to enjoy the pool, but it was (almost) just as good laying in a robe and enjoying the sun next to the pool. The smoothies were made with fresh, gorgeous fruit, and well worth what I paid. I expected to be disappointed but the quality was remarkable, even for a smoothie. They also had a yoga class going on, which we peeked at but skipped. Again, wish I could have brought my yoga pants so I could attend the class. There's always next time!

Stopped in for a bit of a jewelry emergency. We were very clear about what we needed but the staff wasn't receptive to us and kept trying different sales tactics to up their commission. I've shopped at other Zales Outlets and have always had good service with reasonable prices. I don't like how management chooses to run this particular store. I will not be back.

My husband and I stopped in for breakfast one morning. The staff is friendly and the restaurant is bright, clean, and warm.  The egg white and 7 veggie omelet is light, fluffy, with a great variety of vegetables. The Rocky Mountain High omelet is really delicious. The home fries are simple and yummy. I do suggest ordering a side of pancakes - they've got a great nutty flavor.  This place is a really nice breakfast spot. I will definitely be back to try their other menu items.

This was, unfortunately, a disappointment.  I think the key to art museums is that they don't have to have super famous works of art, but they should carry pieces that have significance. I realize this can be very subjective, but I've found amazing experiences and hidden gems in places like Kansas City and St. Louis. I was surprised by the Phoenix Art Museum.  The price is a bit high for admission, but I really like that they allow you to apply your funds for one visit to a membership if you'd like. It's big, clean, and well staffed, but parking can be an issue.  The pieces of work... hm. I think part of the issue is that Arizona is a relatively new state, and the art museum is just over 50 years old. My impression is that this art museum has not had the time to collect varied, interesting pieces to exhibit. I did also find the Asian art section small and disappointing.  That being said, I thought the Phillip C. Curtis exhibit was wonderful. He was a local artist from Arizona and his work is really interesting, especially the commentary on social class in Arizona and the town of Jerome. I think I spent most of my time looking at his work. This is definitely the highlight of the museum.  I really hope with more time that the Phoenix Art Museum will grow, but as of now, I think one visit was enough for me.

Delish! Stopped in for dinner one night. The building is old and can be hard to miss, but there's plenty of parking once you find it.  We had the Chinese broccoli with beef, which was a little salty but excellent. I love the flavor on the beef and the crisp green broccoli. The lobster was wonderful, with a lot of nice ginger flavor and a thick, tasty sauce. My favorite was the salt and pepper shrimp. Lots of fresh green and white onions, with extremely spicy little peppers that gave the entire dish a great kick. The accompanying rice didn't seem fresh, but the portion was big.  The restaurant is old, dirty, and smelly, so don't go in expecting a ton of ambiance. Our server was really nice, packed up our leftovers, and waved to us as we were leaving. If you want authentic, tasty Chinese, stop in, but beware that this place isn't for everyone.

Stopped in relatively early on a Friday night to enjoy $1 drinks till 9 PM. Charlie's was pretty empty, which everyone kept saying was unusual, but I don't typically enjoy large crowds so I was fine with just a handful of people around.  Everyone working there were nice and friendly. Drinks were strong. I love the outdoor seating area - there's covered areas, areas that look like bleachers, regular tables, and areas to stand. There's also a volleyball area which looks pretty fun. Inside was an amazing dance floor that was just getting started when we left. I could see that being an awesome time.  Overall I had a nice time. I would stop in again when it isn't super busy.

I'm afraid I just don't understand the hype of Mi Patio. The restaurant has plenty of parking and it has a good location. It's clean and the decor is really bright and fun. The staff is friendly enough, but I didn't like the food.  I didn't really care for the salsa. It was fresh, but it had a muddled flavor of old cilantro that I didn't like. Also, the chips were stale.  Our food came out quickly, but I was pretty underwhelmed. I had the beef enchiladas with green sauce. The rice and beans had a burnt flavor; it's hard to describe, but I didn't like it. The meat did not taste fresh, and I couldn't see or taste the green sauce. Personally (and I know I'm in the minority here), I thought there was way too much cheese on the plate. I like cheese, but I don't want so much that it makes the food greasy. My husband had beef tacos with rice and beans. He liked the rice, but he felt that the beef wasn't fresh. He didn't finish his plate.  The prices were pretty cheap, but I feel like the food and experience was overhyped. I don't think I'll be back.

Delicious and cheap. Da Vang is pretty easy to find; it's located in a shopping strip with ample parking. The restaurant is large, clean, and very simply decorated. The staff is pretty friendly and the food is great. I recommend the pho ga, spring rolls, and bun (vermicelli bowl).

This is a great dive bar. It's in a strip mall, so there's plenty of parking. There are tables and TVs everywhere so if you want to watch a game, you should be able to get a good view.  Drinks are reasonably priced. It's bar food, but it's decent. Frings basket is a safe way to go (onion rings and fries). Nachos are a bit greasy; I would skip them in the future. Chicken sliders were pretty simple but safe enough in terms of flavor. Wings were better than I thought they would be. I would order wings again.  The staff are friendly, and there's a room where they play live music. I'd be willing to see a show there featuring a local band. Also, someone had mentioned the bathrooms were scary. It wasn't the most beautiful, immaculate bathroom I've ever seen, but it was definitely better than I thought it would be.  I'll be back.

Great venue. The seating is actually pretty comfortable, even if you're not in a booth, and the club is small enough to where you don't feel like you're miles away from the comedian.  Food ranges from mediocre to OK. Chicken tenders are better than I thought they would be. Spinach dip was pretty good. Nachos are average at best but the portion size is generous. I wish the accompanying jalapenos were spicy. House chardonnay, cab, or merlot for $7 is a pretty good deal considering the standard two drink minimum.  Service was really good. Everyone is friendly and knowledgeable. There's plenty of parking because it's located in a strip mall kind of area.  Overall, very nice. I am looking forward to seeing more shows here.

Well... I stopped in on a Thursday night. I was visiting a family member who was briefly in town and she was staying near this restaurant. The reviews seemed good so I figured it was worth a try.  It's located deep in a strip mall. The restaurant is a bit dated and stuffy. Everyone dining was seated on the patio, so we sat there, too. There was a gentlemen playing music on a stereo or DJ equipment (not sure - sorry!) and he was singing with the music, which made for cute ambiance. Unfortunately, this is where the pleasantries seemed to end.  After being seated for 15 minutes, I went inside to find a waitress to take our order. It irritated me that a large party was seated next to us after we were seated and their order was taken before ours. After waiting 50 minutes for food, the waitress said their computer system had died and the order didn't send to the kitchen, so it would be a few more minutes before we got our food. It was after 9:30 PM at this point, and I was starving.  The food: food was extremely average. Baked ziti was very simple. Fettuccine alfredo needed some salt but was OK. After finishing our food, I took the liberty of going inside, finding our waitress, and asking for the check because it was almost 10 PM and I had a good drive ahead of me to get back home.  Prices were relatively reasonable, but service was abysmal. Not going back.

I'm surprised this place has such a low rating. I thought it was pretty good!  The restaurant is pretty, and the staff is really nice. If the weather is nice, I would recommend sitting on the patio. It has a really nice view of the Mandalay Bay Pool, and it's well shaded with fans.  The restaurant starts you off with a nice salsa trio, each of which has a nice, distinct flavor. The carne asada quesadillas are really good - the beef has a great flavor, and are nicely crisped without being greasy. The guacamole is simple but fresh and tasty. The pepper crusted steak salad is really good. The steak is cooked really well, and the salad is a nice bed of fresh greens with avocados and blue cheese. So good!  I would definitely go back!

I stopped in relatively early one morning for a quick breakfast with my husband. Lux is pretty easy to find, and I think the parking is ample. There's always plenty of room on the street a block over if the lot is full.  As pretty much everyone else has mentioned, the place is oozing with hipsters. It can be irritating, but it didn't really ruin my overall experience. My husband had a piece of quiche, which he really liked, and I thought the brioche was good - not too sweet, and a good portion size. The lattes are pretty good, though a little overpriced. Not the best latte I've had, but by no means the worse. The seating is interesting, though it's awkward to figure out where to pick up your drinks and food. We just watched what other people did and tried to follow suit as best we could. I think they want you to bus your dishes, but this was also unclear, I hope we put our dirty dishes in the right place. My experience with the staff was OK; everyone seemed pretty disinterested in what they were doing. Feigning a little interest in your customers is never a bad a thing, and is something I think the staff at Lux should work on.  I would go back to try their other drinks and pastries, but I'm not sure I want to call Lux my go to coffee shop in Phoenix quite yet.

Pretty restaurant. Modern decor with interesting statues and art scattered throughout. Seating is comfortable and they're good at accommodating large groups.  Food is extremely bland - too simple in taste for my preference. Prices are also pretty high relative to what you're getting. I had the buffalo chicken salad, which wasn't spicy and craved flavor. It was a good portion size, but I wasn't impressed. Burger was cooked a true medium, which is good, but again, too simple in flavor. Won't be back.

This busy bakery has several different pastries, desserts, ice cream, and coffee. We tried the red velvet cupcake and a large chocolate chip cookie. The cupcake was large and moist with delicious tangy cream cheese frosting. The cookie wasn't too hard or too soft, and the chocolate was rich and plentiful. I would definitely stop in again to try their other desserts.

So delicious. I love the seating at Cibo - spacey and comfortable. Staff is efficient and service is good.  Brunch is wonderful - it doesn't get too crowded, and the frittatas are like clouds made of eggs. The serving size is good, and the marmalade is out of this world. I don't even like marmalade, but I could eat this all day, every day, forever.   Desserts are pretty Nutella heavy, so if you want something else, you might be out of luck. I thought the tiramisu was pretty good, and the strawberry crepes are great (again, if you like Nutella).  Pizzas are beautiful. I would prefer the crust to be a tiny bit crisper, but it's a minor complaint. I do prefer coming here over Pizzeria Bianco - much less waiting time, and better service with very comparable food.  Seriously, give Cibo a try.

I love Cibo. Whether it's brunch, dinner, or a random meal, it's always so good here.  After trying a few pizzas, I can't pick a favorite. Each one is made so well, with such delicious and fresh ingredients, that it's hard to go wrong. I guess if you pick a pizza with ingredients you hate, it won't be good, but probably not any fault of Cibo.  Happy hour is really nice. Cheap house wine and Italian beer, plus a sample of food items. The gnocchi is fantastic - really wonderful and great to split with a couple people. In terms of appetizers, it's so hard to beat the caprese. The seasoning on the tomatoes is out of this world. It's my favorite caprese in Phoenix.  Again, if you aren't huge on Nutella, dessert might be a bit challenging. That being said, I love sharing a strawberry and Nutella crepe with my husband at the end of a meal at Cibo. It's so good... so good.  Can't really describe it any other way.

What a great place. I stopped in with some friends for happy hour (4:00-6:30, I believe). Each night has different specials; we were able to enjoy half priced house wine and well cocktails.  Our server was really friendly and the restaurant is tasteful and pretty. We started with the spicy hummus, which was delicious - the bread was soft and flavorful, and the humus had a great taste and texture. The arroz con pollo was really, really good. The rosemary chicken sandwich was good, although I think the pesto was a little heavy. The accompanying salad was fantastic - I loved the bright, fresh dressing on the salad. The veggie burger was great - really flavorful patty with great toppings.  I am looking forward to coming back and trying brunch, as well as other dinner items.

Surprised by my good visit! If you want to stay downtown, this is the place to do it. Lots of fun, old school Vegas feel going on here.  Great location relative to Fremont Street. Prices are reasonable and the rooms are large, clean, with interesting furniture and carpet patterns. My only issue was the inconsistency of the AC. On a previous visit, the room was freezing. On my most recent visit, the AC was turned to max cool but the room was still pretty warm.  Make sure to ask for a room in the north tower. The elevators for the north tower are right next to the check in desk, so the walk is super short and you can get a nice view of Fremont Street if your floor isn't too high up (higher than the 16th floor).  The payouts at the tables are good, too (higher than many places we visited on the strip). There's a restaurant, food court, and a little cafe that make dining easy.  I would stay here again.

Great variety, even just for breakfast. We ended up getting seated about 10:30 AM, so we were able to have breakfast and lunch while only being charged for breakfast.  The scrambled eggs are just OK, but the made to order omelets and mini Belgium waffles were really good. Their little selection of vegetarian enchiladas, pico, and black bean salad were all really tasty. The ma po tofu was fantastic, as were the spring rolls and garlic vegetables. The salad bar was adequate, and the other breakfast staples, like oatmeal and fruit, were all adequate.  The sushi was disappointing and dry, but the pizza was good. The desserts were hit and miss. Some were really great, like the passion fruit tapioca pudding, but some other things, like the mini cakes, were dry.  Overall, many things were good, some were delicious, and a few were disappointing. The restaurant is beautiful and the service is pretty good. I would recommend going for an earlier meal to save some money while still getting to enjoy the great variety.

So good.  Stopped in for lunch one day and we were very happy with the experience. It got busy quickly; we were able to snag a parking spot instead of having to valet. Inside, there's lots of indoor and outdoor seating. The booths are super big and comfortable.  Started with the deviled eggs, which were great. I had the veggie tacos, which came with an interesting mix of beans and greens in addition to tortillas, salsa, guacamole, and delish kale salad. The seasoning was so good and it was just a nice hearty lunch that didn't feel like it was a complete slap in my diet's face.  Husband had a burger, which he asked for medium rare but received medium. Not a big deal - it was moist and delicious. The accompanying fries were excellent and we ate ALL OF THEM. Literally every single fry - worth it!  Service was good. I'll definitely be back,

Much nicer than I thought it would be!  My husband and I love aquariums, so we had to stop by the Shark Reef Aquarium. I was surprised by the variety of animals they had. The exhibits were very well kept and nice, with plenty of space for lots of people to comfortably stand.  I would recommend stopping by at least once. Really nice, really fun!

Bad, overpriced food.  The breakfast platter is not good. I think the scrambled eggs are made of powdered eggs - they are barely edible. The bacon is greasy, although the hashbrowns and pancakes are OK.  The oatmeal is fine. The greek yogurt berry parfait is surprisingly OK, although the fruit is frozen rather than fresh.  The service is slow. The restaurant itself is clean and simple enough, but I will not be back.

Oh my delicious. Love La Grande Orange!  We ordered several different pizzas to share and each one was delicious. The crust is thin and crispy, the toppings are fresh and beautiful, and everything is made so well. Our server, Courtney, was super helpful and all around awesome.  The white wine sangria was especially noteworthy. I usually don't like white wine sangria (I'm more of a red fan), but this was so fresh and delicious. I definitely recommend ordering a glass.  Chocolate chip gelato was really creamy and good, and the red velvet cupcake was nice with a tangy cream cheese frosting that I really liked. I cannot wait to go back and try every pizza on the menu.

This is a nice, steep, 1 mile hike that will give you a great workout. It's pretty rocky, and there's a few benches along the way to the top that you can use to rest. Like other people have mentioned, I would recommend light hiking shoes instead of heavier boots as this terrain is difficult and can wear out your knees and ankles - the extra weight of a heavy shoe doesn't help.  Bring some water and try to go early on the weekend or any time during the week to avoid a ton of people.

I'm sorry but no. Subpar. I just don't get the rave reviews.  After trying to get in on a busy Saturday night, we stopped in a week later midafternoon. It can be easy to miss, but keep a look out for a small menu posted outside by the front door. Inside, you grab whatever seat is available, so you're either at the bar or seated at one of a few different large community tables.  We had the carne adovado sliders as an appetizer. They were OK, nothing outstanding or special. I had the chicken burrito with green chile sauce, and my husband had the taos club.  The chicken in the burrito was very dry. I didn't get a lot of flavor, either, aside from salt and tons of cheese. The rice was dry and tasted a little burnt. I liked the beans, but I wanted more green chile sauce and more flavor out of the entire meal.  The taos club was pretty good. The avocado was a little hard and not distributed evenly in the club, so one bite was full of one ingredient and another bite was full of something else. The accompanying salad and fries were nice, but again, we just didn't see the ooh and ahh that everyone else has seemed to experience.  Portions were large, but prices were high to match. I just was not impressed. Small restaurant with awkward seating, food that is average at best, and expensive prices for what you get. I won't be back.

I can't lie - I had a lot of fun here. This casino is definitely reminiscent of old school Vegas. Lots of slots and tables that pay out pretty well. The staff are all nice. It doesn't get too crowded, which I like. I'd go back!

So very nice. I really like the design and feel of The Clarendon. The room we had was large, spacious, and well decorated. Lots of amenities, including a nice Keurig machine in the room, and plenty of products available for purchase in case you needed something (mouthwash or Redbull, anyone?).  The view of the pool is really nice, and it's always packed. I'd like to stop by sometime when it's warmer. The rooftop bar looks great, too. There wasn't anything going on when we stayed but I think we'll definitely be back.

Macaroons! Big, beautiful display when you walk in, with lots of people crowded around picking out flavors. The bakery itself is small, with everyone moving around trying to order and find seats. The staff are serious, to the point, and not terribly friendly, but they are quick and efficient.  Tried a pumpkin, hazelnut, chocolate, and caramel macaroon. Pumpkin is so good - makes me so nostalgic for the holidays. Chocolate and hazelnut macaroons are rich and delicious. The caramel is very sweet - I might skip it in the future, but if you have a serious sweet tooth, give it a try. Also had a fudgey chocolate cookie (I forget the exact name), which was good.  The macaroons here are the best I've had in Phoenix. I will definitely be back!

So delicious!  After being told there was an hour wait, we were pleasantly surprised to be seated after only 15 minutes. The staff is very friendly, and the restaurant is beautiful. Cocktails are overpriced, but what do you expect in Vegas?  We had the truffle potato chips with blue cheese sauce. It was very rich, unusual, and delicious. If you like blue cheese, I highly recommend trying these.  My husband had the grilled steak skewers as an entree, while I had the organic chicken. The steak was tender, flavored well, and the coleslaw was fresh and tasty. The organic chicken was beautiful, not just in presentation but also in terms of taste. The mashed potatoes and vegetables were the perfect match but the crispy, light chicken.  Overall, we had a great experience and I would definitely go back.

I like Sprouts because it has a similar selection of foods you'd find at places like Whole Foods and Trader Joes but it's a little more affordable. There isn't as much variety, to be sure, but it has many of the basics. Definitely worth at least one try!

This is a charming little restaurant in Mesa. I didn't think I would like it as much as I did.  The restaurant is small, quaint, with a nice outdoor seating area. It's located in a shopping strip, so there's plenty of parking. Staff are friendly and nice.  I like that they rotate their wines frequently based on availability. Prices are reasonable for either a glass or bottle, so you can spend quite a bit or not much at all depending on your mood. I tried a glass of Syrah, which was lovely.  I had the bruschetta with caprese, brie, and chipotle/avocado. The caprese was good, the brie was refreshing and light, and the chipotle/avocado was really flavorful - probably my favorite. I thought the prices were reasonable given portion size and flavor.  D'Vine is a bit out of the way for me, so I don't think I'd make a special trip. However, if I was in the area, I would be more than happy to stop in. If you live nearby or like wine bars, I would definitely give D'Vine a try.

I am going to gain so much weight from this place! Seriously, I love Urban Cookies after just one trip. I love sweets, I love baking, and I'm new to Phoenix, so I had to find myself a local bakery ASAP.  The shop is small but the parking is ample. I love the store - it's small but quaint, very clean, and simply but tastefully decorated. All the baked goods are on display that showcase how pretty and meticulously everything is decorated. The staff was also friendly and helpful.  The snickerdoodles are super soft and delicious - great texture. They really hit the nail on this simple cookie. The pumpkin bread is so moist and sweet. The brownie is a delicious take on the classic brownie - it's soft and chocolatey, with the right texture. The smores cupcake is so creative and well executed. I may not get it when I visit in the future, but I definitely recommend trying it at least once. My personal favorite is the chocolate cupcake. The cake is moist and crumbly and the frosting is rich, creamy, and delicious.  I cannot wait to go back. Even my husband, who isn't huge on desserts and sweets in general, liked everything we tried. For me, Urban Cookies is well worth the calories!

As with Steele Indian School Park, I'm surprised by the low rating. However, several reviews are from a few years ago, so I'm assuming they've updated the park and the dog park a lot.  There's two dog parks, once for big dogs and one for smaller dogs. Both are large, with lots of grass and picnic tables for people to sit. I would bring your own bag to pick up after your dog and your own water. The big dog park tends to hold water after it rains, so it can get a little muddy, but the small dog park doesn't seem to have this issue.  Really nice! I'll be bringing my dog back.

Love this place. Condos are safe, gated, and super clean. The grounds are regularly maintained and the residents, for the most part, do their part to keep everything clean, though you will find the occasional dog poop lying in the grass.  Location is great, there's plenty of parking, and everyone is friendly.  Minus one star because condos can be difficult to find (the buildings and condos are numbered in a bit of a confusing way), the fitness center is tiny and dated, and cabinet space in the kitchens is a bit small. However, once you've navigated a couple times, found a good time for your workout, and managed to cleverly arrange your kitchen upon moving in, you're good to go.

Amazing. So delicious. The shop itself is beautiful, with a nice sitting area if you want dessert and cocktails. We picked up a few chocolates and a bar and were not disappointed in the least bit.  The dark ganache truffle is rich, fantastic, delicious. Hazelnut is wonderful, coconut is yummy with a nice texture, milk ganache is simple and sweet, and the Irish creme was beyond what I would expect.  The milk gooey chocolate bar is perfectly balanced with caramel. Usually, bars like this are overdone and too sweet, but this was the best.  I cannot wait to stop in again and have a cake based dessert with a cocktail. This place is a little pricey, but definitely worth it.

Very nice. Stopped in for dinner on a busy Friday night and we had a great time. The almond margarita is really excellent, with an unusual flavor and delicious taste. The vegetable flatbread is relatively healthy and light - good option if you're avoiding meat. The French onion burger is really tender and delicious, and I liked the thick cut fries that came with it. The pork chile verde is spicy and yummy, with a great cornbread on the side. The chicken salad sandwich is good, but I'm not sure if it's worth getting again. The other menu items are so good and promising that i think the chicken salad sandwich is a little too boring in comparison.  The service was a little slow, and I thought the seating was a bit crowded. Overall, very nice. I'd go back (especially for happy hour).

Not very good. Stopped in for a quick lunch while I was in the area. The restaurant is in a strip mall with a decent amount of parking. There's plenty of seating, but the restaurant is pretty dirty and cramped. I ordered the chicken katsu mini meal. It was very plain - nothing remarkable about the flavors or cook or anything. It was pretty cheap, but greasy.  Staff seemed bored and irritated that they worked there. I wouldn't go back.

Loved it! Stopped in for a quick lunch and I loved every second. I was surprised to find such good eats in the Mesa/Gilbert/Chandler area, as a lot of places are chain restaurants.  I had a veggie sandwich, which was light, fresh, and tasty. I also had a black coffee and a beautiful funfetti whoopie pie. It was such a yummy treat to end the meal. It was pretty decadent, so I split it with a friend and was still satisfied.  Restaurant is open, spacey, with nice seating both inside and outside. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. It may not be the most amazing sandwich of my life, but it was very good, and I'd definitely go back, especially for more dessert. Give it a go! I'll be back when I'm in the area.

I like this place! We stopped in for drinks and a light meal and were not disappointed.  We sat in the lounge seats, which were a bit awkward and cramped. Our waiter was nice enough to switch us to the bar seating (much better in my opinion). $4 house cab and chardonnay Mondays is a great deal. They also have a bunch of beer on draft at a reasonable price.  The wedge fry bowl is really good - I really liked the aioli and the fries were thick and delicious. The house burger was really good - cooked medium just like we asked, and the accompanying Caesar salad was light and refreshing. The bread pudding was delicious - I definitely recommend trying it.  Overall, very good experience. I will be back!

So I've been back to Switch several times since my review a couple months ago. I think my experiences have been so good that I had to update my old review.  The food is always excellent. The burgers are cooked really well and the toppings are delicious. Salads are large, fresh, and tasty. Apricot BBQ feta chicken sandwich is amazing, as is this pot pie.  Drink specials are excellent. Brunch is fantastic - breakfast gallette and $4 screwdriver, cape code, or bloody mary carafes are the way to go.  Honestly, I think the service is some of the best I've experienced in Phoenix. The servers are always friendly, attentive, polite, and nice. I don't have to wave someone down for a refill or for my check. Ambiance is wonderful, and I can't wait for the cooler weather to sit outside in the patio area.  I think Switch is my favorite go to, reliable, wonderful restaurant in Phoenix.

So I am not sure what to make of the brewery experience. I've had some of their beers on tap at other bars/restaurants, and I've bought some cans and bottles at Total Wine and whatnot, but I didn't have a great time at the actual restaurant.  Service was kind of slow. Seating was super close to other tables, and the chairs are not comfortable. Several of the beers we wanted were out, so we ended up settling on some that were just OK.  Pub food is usually underwhelming, and that's what happened here. We started with chicken nachos, santan slingers, and the pretzels. The chicken nachos were fine. It was a good portion and nice and greasy. Slingers were very rich and heavy. The table was kind of divided on them - half love, half hate. Pretzels were nice, soft, and the mustard and cheese sauces were good.  The entrees were not a hit all the way round. Devil's chicken fingers were plain and fine if you like fried food. Southwest friend chicken was plain. Chandler club was kind of boring. Southwest chicken sandwich was also quite boring. Texas beef dip sandwich was fine.  Again, I know pub food is never amazing, but this was pricey for being so bland. I wouldn't mind stopping in again for a beer, but I would pass on food. Overall, just an OK experience.

I have to say that I'm surprised at the rating Steele Indian School Park has on Yelp. Some of the reviews are a few years old, so I'm guessing that things have changed a bit since some of the reviews are posted.  I live nearby so I decided to go for a run around the park one evening. I was a little confusing going in because of how the park is labeled with VA signs all around, but I was able to find my way pretty easily. Parking is ample.  The park is maintained really well. It's clean, with lots of (green!) grass, shrubs, and palm trees. The running paths are wide. The dog parks were full with lots of owners and cute dogs; I love that there are two, one for larger dogs and another for smaller. The playground area was busy with kids, but removed from other sitting areas in case you want some distance from the noise and chaos children can bring when they're playing. I also like that there's a fishing area; it's like the city tried to cater to everyone's taste as best they could.  I would like to bring my dog for a walk here. I plan on going back to walk, exercise, and just enjoy the outdoors (especially when it cools down). I think it's a nice, tasteful signature downtown park for the city of Phoenix.

Really nice set up inside, although when we visited it was really hot, like the AC wasn't on. The fish and chips are awesome - crispy, flaky, and delicious. The tartar sauce and cole slaw are also pretty good. I like the location a lot; I'd like to come back and try some of their other stuff.

I am a fan of Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali, so when I walked by this restaurant in Vegas, I had to try it. The restaurant seating was full, so my husband and I opted to sit in the bar for a small late night dinner.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff is friendly. The service was a little slow, but we were seated in the bar area, so I'm not surprised. We had the ravioli with brown sage butter and the beef agnolotti. The ravioli was superb - seriously, I have never had anything like that before. It's an appetizer so it was just one large ravioli, but it was beautifully plated and was the perfect balance of salty sweet. Very unusual, and very delicious.  The beef agnolotti was also excellent. The filling was rich and tender, the pasta was well cooked, and the sauce was simple and delicious.  I wish we were hungrier so that we would have tried their steaks and sides. If the two dishes we had were any indication about the rest of their menu, I am sure it will be a delicious meal. I can't wait to go back.

Yum!  This restaurant is so simple and cute. The pad thai is fresh and delicious, though a little sweet for my personal taste. I suggest asking for a lime on the side to add a little tartness. The red curry is rich and flavorful. The signature Thai Basil dish is also really good - lots of beautiful vegetables and complex flavor.  I highly recommend trying the combination appetizer. The fried sweet potatoes are so crispy and delicious. The spring rolls are a little greasy but really tasty. The fried tofu is very crisp and delicious - goes great with any of the sauces they include with the appetizer. The chicken satay is really moist, and the Thai toast is good, too.  The portions are good and the prices are reasonable. I will definitely be back!

So, Sweet Republic lived up to the hype. I mean seriously, so good. If you like ice cream, you have to try this.  The shop is small, clean, and the staff is helpful. The cherry chocolate chip is full of chunks of delicious, ripe cherries. The vanilla is so smooth, creamy, simple, and wonderful. The Belgian chocolate is rich - perfect for chocolate lovers. The Rocky Road is so good! The homemade marshmallow is what really does it - so soft and fluffy, with such a great flavor. I wish I had purchased a bag on our way out. I will definitely do so in the future.  I got a cup and my husband got a waffle bowl. I wish I had gotten a waffle bowl, too. It's fresh, and it has a great flavor with the perfect texture.  Well worth the calories! I can't wait to go back and try, oh, say, everything.

Yes! Now this is some good south Indian food!  South Indian food is pretty different from North Indian food. Most people think of chicken tikka and palak paneer when they think of Indian food. South Indian food is almost always vegetarian, even vegan, and uses some different spices so the flavor can be pretty different.  Woodlands is small, the restaurant lacks ambiance, and the interior can be dirty. That being said, the food is fresh, well seasoned, and yummy. My favorite appetizer is iddly (steamed rice and lentil patties that are very simple in flavor but should be dipped in sambar, which is easily described as a spicy vegetable soup). Vada are deep fried pieces of lentil and flour dough that are also dipped in sambar.  For entrees, a masala dosa is a wonderful thin crepe like bread stuffed with potatoes (also served with sambar). Woodlands has lots of different types of dosa if you feel adventurous; I like the mysore masala dosa as it's a bit spicier. Vegetable uthappam looks like a big pancake and it's covered in veggies (again, served with sambar!). This is really yummy and filling.   I haven't had the other entrees here but I will definitely be trying the uppuma, channa batura, and poori masal. I would give this place 5 stars for food, especially in Phoenix where Indian restaurants are few and far between, but the dirty interior knocks it down a star. That being said, if you set reasonable expectations, I think you'll be glad you gave Woodlands a try.

Grew up eating Dickey's in Texas. So excited there's a couple locations in Phoenix. After reading some of the reviews, I was happy that the service I had was good rather than abysmal.  Our order was taken quickly, food brought out a few minutes after, and none of the staff were acting unprofessional as far as I could see. I had the quarter plate with sliced brisket, potato salad, and cole slaw. I like the smaller portion of the quarter plate since the regular 1 meat plate is a bit much for me. Cole slaw isn't weighed down too heavily with mayonnaise which is nice. Potato salad is super creamy. Accompanying roll was soft and buttery.  Yum! If you like Texas style BBQ, try Dickey's.

Gotta love Postino!!! Seriously, this place is amazing. I finally tried this location, which is funny because it's the closest to where I live, but it's small and parking can be a pain, even with the wonderful lot that's next to Windsor. That being said, it's worth digging up a spot and waiting in line to get in.  Wonderful wine... what can I say? You will easily find something you like on the menu. There's plenty of beer to go around if that's your thing. Also, the bellinis are really yummy!  For food, I usually stick to the bruschetta. Mix and match to your heart's desire. My favorites are fresh tomato with mozzarella and basil, roasted peppers with goat cheese, and smoked salmon with pesto.  Sit outside if the weather is nice. You will not be disappointed!

Gallo is very close to where I live, and after reading all the great reviews, I had to try it. There's plenty of parking on the street with a short walking distance. The restaurant is nicely decorated but a little cramped. The staff is friendly but I thought our server could have been a little more helpful.  We had the queso with vegetables - fantastic. I really like that they give you chips and tortillas to use for dipping.  The carne asada tacos are so delicious. The beef is tender, with great flavor, and the simple cilantro and lime topping is perfect. The huevos rancheros are also very good. It's a big portion size, which I happily took home as leftovers. The two sauces they give you are fresh, spicy, and delicious. I could eat the tomatillo sauce all day, every day.  Happy hour is 3 - 6, and includes several menu items being marked $1 less from the listed price. Great deal!  I can't wait to go back.

For fro-yo, this is about as good as it gets. There are lots of flavors to choose from, the variety of toppings is amazing, and I love that they offer brownies and cookies to line the bottom of your cup before adding ice cream and toppings. I also think the price is fair for what you get.

Pleasantly surprised by the lunch buffet. I like that you're given fresh naan that's brought to you as you're ready for it.  Daal is good, without being over or under spiced. Chicken korma is a little heavy but the seasonings are solid. Veggie samosas are a little doughy but the filling is fresh and cooked well.  The dishes aren't overpowering in terms of spiciness, which is good for people with sensitive stomachs. The gulab jamun are disappointing - dense and not served warm. It is nice that chai is included in the buffet.  Restaurant is clean, simple, sufficient. Indian restaurants are not known for ambiance, so don't expect too much.  I plan on going back.

Small, well stocked Indian grocery store with a good lunch buffet.  Pros: +Fresh naan that's brought to you as you're ready for it + Food isn't too spicy for those with sensitive stomachs and/or new to Indian food + Veggie samosas and mint chutney yum + Chai available in the buffet line  Cons: - Gulab jamun too dense and not served warm - Restaurant isn't oozing with ambiance  All in all, quite nice, quite good.

Stopped in one night for dinner. I like the decor a lot; really nice ambiance. Our server was really attentive and helpful, too.  The habanero chicken tacos are good. I really like the rice and beans, but I didn't think the tacos were that spicy. To be fair, I do have a high threshold for spiciness, so my criticism isn't the most fair. Still, the tacos were good.  My husband got the burger. He didn't really care for it, but I don't think Hula's is the kind of place you go to for a burger. If you go and you're thinking about getting a burger, just don't. Try something else, like some tacos or the ribs. I will say that the accompanying Caesar salad was fantastic. I did not expect such a good salad but it was really excellent.  Mai tais are delish, but super strong! If you're going to have more than one, make sure you have someone to drive you home (who hasn't been sipping on mai tais with you).  Overall, very nice. I'd like to stop by again.

Gotta love Total Wine. Great selection of wine, beer, and liquor. Whether you're looking for something high end or cheap and affordable, Total Wine is bound to leave you a satisfied customer. I also love the beers they rotate at this location - it's fun to pick a new beer and enjoy a growler at home.

Cute, quaint, simple, honest. I really like this place.  The pad thai isn't the best I've had, but it's still very good. The portion is large, and the price is reasonable. The green curry is really good. I don't think it's too sweet, and there's tons of vegetables in addition to protein. I loved the cook on the tofu. I did ask for medium heat and I felt that I was given mild. I have a high tolerance for spiciness so maybe that's why it didn't seem as hot to me. In the future, I'll definitely get 5/5 on the heat scale.  The peanut sauce is really thick, creamy, and sweet. I personally prefer peanut sauce to be a little spicier, but my husband went crazy for it. He couldn't get enough!  Overall, very nice. If I'm in the area, I will stop by again.

Big fan. I love how casual this place is, and I love the outdoor patio: perfectly shaded with spacious, comfortable seating. Good amount of parking, and no valet so you save a few bucks (yay!).  Happy hour is great - 1/2 off cocktails, $2.50 pints, and $4 house wine. The West Coast cocktail is delicious and has a lot going on. It makes me feel like I should be lying on a beach wearing sunglasses while I sip it.  Chips and salsa - really good. Salsa is nice and fresh, chips are nicely salted. Grilled cheese sandwich is delish. Love the blend of cheese they use, and so glad they use fresh, ripe tomatoes. Got a salad on the side, which was dressed a little heavily but still tasted good. I watched people eating sandwiches at other tables and each one looked amazing.  I will definitely be back!

Still a big fan. Happy hour continues to be a great deal with half price cocktails, half off pints, and $4 house wine. West coast is still great if you like rum. Key Limetini is amazing - so refreshing, so delicious, and strong. A couple of these will knock your socks off. TMI lemonade is also great. I could rotate between all three drinks all day, but common sense tells me this isn't the best idea I've ever had.  Chips and salsa are great and a bit spicy. TMI toast sounds great but I thought the cream cheese dip was bland and not worth the calories. Sophie's salad is delish. Veggie quesadila is also really good and comes with a nice side of salsa and guacamole. Griddled cheese is so great - my husband likes adding bacon to make it even more hearty and delicious. BLT is also good, and veggie sandwich is yummy. I am not a big fan of  the jive turkey sandwich - the meat is super dry, and there's too much of it. The sandwich kinds of falls apart and makes a big mess, and trying to piece it back together isn't really worth it.  Service and prices are good. Parking is pretty ample, although during happy hour it can be hard to grab a spot. Overall, still quite good!

Maybe I'm getting too old to enjoy loud music - so loud you're basically yelling at the person sitting next to you - at 10 AM on a Saturday, but RnR wasn't for me. I feel like it's trying too hard to push for an experience that resonates of amazing, crazy, youthful, full of party animals, and outrageous, but it ends up feeling cheesy, forced, and a little more on the unpleasant side.  The menu is big, and drinks range from reasonably priced to whaaat? NO! There are some good bottomless brunch cocktail specials on the weekend. I didn't try the food so I can't really comment.  After having one round, we left. I think given the right mindset (and time of day), RnR could be fun, but it'll be a good while before I give it another go.

Great for brunch. Classic American is always a good way to go. Tofu scrambler was also delicious and a nice change of pace from the usual brunch items. French toast is decadent and heavy. Coffee is good!

I have to thank Yelp for helping me find this place. I'm new to the Phoenix area and was in desperate need for a haircut. After years of paying for bad cuts, I'd rather grow my hair out and tie it up than deal with the pain of growing out a style I hate for months (which is what I ended up doing the last two years or so).  I was able to make a same day appointment with Sonia. The mini massage I got while she washed my hair was, on its own, worth the price I paid for my cut. She was extremely friendly, polite, and meticulous in making sure I got the cut I described and wanted. She answered all questions I had regarding styling and made the whole experience pleasant. I think the cut was reasonably price as well.  I highly recommend Sonia if you're new to Shampoo Ink. I am already certain that this will be my go to salon in Phoenix.

So it's been about two years since my first visit to Shampoo Ink. I have to say, it's still fantastic.  Making an appointment is easy. On the rare occasion someone doesn't answer the phone, you can leave a message and you get a call back in a day or two. The staff are all super friendly. Sonia is amazing and does such a great job with any haircut you ask for. All the customers look great, and I'm betting anywhere who works here as a stylist will probably do a great job.  They still do the nice personal touch with coffee or water. The salon is super clean and comfortable. The only downside is that parking is sometimes a pain - street parking is limited so I would get there early to make sure you have time to look for a spot. But the minor parking issue aside, it's a great place to feel good.

Very nice, interesting coffee shop. We stopped in for drinks before dinner and really enjoyed the art gallery. If I'm downtown again, I will definitely stop by.

Awesome. What a great candy store. It's huge!  There's a few bins of loose candy you can mix and match. They have your standard selection. After that, you begin the long, wonderful trek up and down each aisle jam packed with candies we're all familiar with (AirHeads, Nerds, chocolate coins) and other more exotics I haven't seen before. You can buy bulk (a huge case of cherry only AirHeads? YES!), or you can buy a handful (just a couple Kazoozles for me).  There is a nice little section of international candy, too. I was happy to pick up a Cadbury's Flake bar and a fruit and nut bar. The staff are also really knowledgeable about the different candies, which is awesome. I left with way more than what I needed. I can't wait to go back.

Reallllllllly good. Definitely enjoyed my meal here.  Gyro is yummy with a reasonable price and some nice options if you don't want to get fries and a drink (like double meat at an extra charge). Chicken shawarma is served on a bed of fluffy rice. Definitely enjoyed it. Baklava - awesome. So delicious.  Location can be hard to find, but it's a good, solid gyro shop in Central Phoenix. I will be back.

GREAT happy hour - $3 beer, house wine, and well drinks, plus drink of the day. Food is pretty good, too. Wings were nice, but not too spicy. Hummus came as a nice trio, though we had to ask for more bread.  I love the patio area, especially when the weather is cooler. I would like to come back and try the rest of the menu. Overall, very nice.

After trying The Gladly and falling in love, I figured I had to try the older sister, aka Citizen Public House.  I am not huge on Old Town Scottsdale. Don't get me wrong - it can be fun, and there's some good eats, but I'm more of a Central Phoenix gal. That being said, this location is very nice. It's not right on Scottsdale Road, but rather on a side street, so parking isn't as crazy, which is a definite plus.  Restaurant is big, spacious, tastefully decorated, and the service is good. We were lucky enough to get in on the tail end of happy hour. I had the pacific coast cocktail, which tasted pretty good, and it was strong, which made it definitely good. It had an interesting flavor and it wasn't too sweet. My husband had boulvardier, which was also nice and good if you like bourbon.  Food wise, I had my favorite chopped salad because I'm hooked and I just can't get enough. It was lovely, as always. My husband had the buttermilk roasted chicken, which was awesome. The chicken was super moist. I love brussel sprouts so I gladly ate them off the plate - they were seasoned well and cooked al dente. Accompanying succotash was also very good. I wish we had tried dessert but we were too full.  It was very nice, and if you live nearby or haven't tried it yet, I think it's worth a trip. Since The Gladly is a lot closer for me, I think it'll be my go to place, but I was not at all disappointed with Citizen Public House. Given the choice of any restaurant is Old Town Scottsdale, I honestly think this would be my number 1.

Very nice. Love the patio section - nice view of downtown. Servers are super nice and helpful, too.  Happy hour (3 PM - 6 PM) has some great prices for cocktails, beer, and wine. Pretzels with fondue are so delicious - soft, chewy, salty! Crispy shrimp are awesome. The portion size is good for the price and the aioli takes the shrimp over the top.  Tried some of the chacuterie meats, which were also great. Love the crusty bread they're served with. Will definitely be back for more good eats and drinks!

In terms of food, I think Ri Ra is definitely a 4/5. The Irish potato cakes are delicious - I highly recommend these as an appetizer. The potato cakes themselves are light and fluffy, and the accompanying sauces are so flavorful.  The Guinness BBQ burger is really good. It has a great smoky flavor and the sauce is great. The chicken curry is really good. It isn't too spicy, but it has a nice flavor.  The staff is really friendly, and the restaurant is really nice and relaxed. I just think that the prices, even for Vegas, are a little high. For this reason alone I might skip Ri Ra in the future and spend the same amount of money at a place that I feel has better food for the same price.  Overall, good food, nice staff, and fun restaurant, if not a little overpriced.

Really good! We stopped in one night for dinner. The restaurant is really nicely decorated. The staff is friendly, but we were a little confused about who the hostess was and who our waitress was.  We had the Greek God as an appetizer. The bread was soft and delicious, and the hummus was good, though I think they were a little light handed on how much hummus they gave us. The marinated vegetables were so delicious, though - definitely my favorite part of the entire appetizer.  My husband had the bacon cheeseburger, which was cooked to a perfect medium. The meat was moist and delicious, and the toppings were fresh. He had the mac and cheese as a side, which was really good.  I had the veggie stack, which I loved. The selection of vegetables were so delicious, and the portion was huge. I had an heirloom tomato salad on the side; I thought the choice of fresh mint as part of the dressing was fantastic. So good!  Can't wait to go back.

After a few more trips to Windsor, I have to say that I am a serious fan. Yes, the ambiance and decor continue to be wonderful. The service is always great. After sampling a few more eats in Phoenix, I had to bump Windsor up to a 5 for a few reasons:  1. Whoever runs the bar is amazing, because the taps are impeccably clean as evidenced by the fact that any beer you have at Windsor tastes better than pretty much anywhere else you get can get the same draft. Definitely makes for a nice dining experience, especially when you're having $5 pitchers during happy hour.  2. Amazing brunch, with a simple but sufficient menu. The Matador is great, and the accompanying salsa verde brings your tastebuds pretty close to heaven. The chef poaches eggs perfectly. And bloody mary bar: need I say more?  3. Anyone who can make kale taste this good is a hero. Mac&cheese is wonderful without feeling too heavy/greasy/depressing. Fries are yummy, too, which isn't always the case at nice restaurants.  4. Wonderful, large, shaded patio with comfortable seating that has large heaters to warm you up during the cool weather.

So good! We stopped in for a couple scoops of ice cream and were not disappointed. The toasted coconut is delicious. It's creamy, flavorful, and I thought the serving size was fair. The Vietnamese coffee was also great. If you're a coffee fan, I highly suggest trying it.  The shop is really cute with lots of candy for sale. I will definitely be back to try other flavors.

YES! Yum. After a friend recommended Frost, I was slow in trying it because it's pretty far from where I live. I was in the area recently so I figured I should stop in because I wasn't sure when I'd be nearby again. So glad I made some extra time.  It's located in a shopping complex behind an Italian restaurant. There's a lot of parking on the street but it's probably pretty full on weekends.  The shop is big, modern, and the staff are really nice and friendly. The case of gelato is huge, and I had to walk back and forth a few times. I finally decided to have one serving of my favorite: stracciatella. It was awesome. So creamy, wonderfully flaked and blended chocolate chips, rich, and delicious. They added a little pirouette cookie for garnish which I gladly ate.  I will be back to try the many other flavors.

Yum! Loved it! Veggie restaurants always run the risk being... boring? Not the case with Green. Stopped in for lunch with some friends and I was not disappointed.  There's a small parking lot shared with Nami. You can also park around the perimeter of the building in different marked spots. The restaurant is modern and simple and comfortable.  Lots of different wines and beers available, and I would have loved to have one, but I opted for one of many different healthy flavored water drinks in the fridge by the counter. I had the Thai peanut bowl with house tofu and noodles. Sauce was spicy and delish; noodles were cooked well, and there were nice big pieces of fresh broccoli and carrots alongside perfectly done tofu. It was filling and yummy, and I did not feel depressed (from grease and calories) after eating it.  The big wac really does taste like a big mac. It looks beautiful - the way you'd hope a big mac would look, and it tastes awesome. Calexico burger was pretty good. Cole slaw is really fresh, really good, and the fries are amazing. I could eat the fries all day, every day.  I will be back! Even if you're not huge on veggie only food, this place is worth a try. If you like tofu, definitely stop in. Faux meats taste really close to real meat so again, give it a go!

Delish!  Friendly staff, and pretty restaurant. We had spring rolls for an appetizer. They were delicious, although my only criticism is that they were a little greasy. The pad thai was delicious - great flavor, and huge portion. The red curry is also great - plenty of vegetables, and well cooked tofu.  I would definitely go back!

Very weak 4. If I could give half stars, I would give OHSO 3.5  I like the location and the layout of the restaurant. We started with the spinach artichoke and crab dip, which was pretty good but a little too fishy, like the crab wasn't fresh. I had the OHSO salad, which was good. The cook on the steak was nice, and the greens were fresh. My husband had the gnocchi bolognese, which he enjoyed, but he felt that the sausage on the dish was overpowering. Red wine sangria was fine - nothing extraordinary, but good.  The service was very slow, and honestly pretty bad. I don't know if our server forgot our table was there, but she seemed more interested in chatting with the table behind us than taking our orders and refilling our drinks. I also think the portions are small for the price.  Overall, we had an OK time. I would go back for drinks. I'm hoping the bad service was a one time fluke.

I'm surprised the reviews aren't higher for Caketini. I stopped in and tried a strawberry cake pop, a chocolate hazelnut cake pop, a red velvet cake pop, and a coconut cake pop. The strawberry is very sweet, a little too much for me, but very good. The chocolate hazelnut is rich and so delicious - if you love chocolate, this is the cake pop for you. The red velvet and coconut were also very good.  The cupcakes look so pretty; I can't wait to go back and try one.

I like Grassroots for several reasons:  1. Good service. Everyone is nice, attentive, and the recommendations are usually very good. 2. Happy hour, or as they like to call it, social hour, features several good appetizers and drinks at reasonable prices. Some happy hours don't really seem like a good deal but Grassroots does a nice job. 3. Lots of tasty, light beers on tap that go well with the year round warm to hot Phoenix weather. 4. Burrata is yummay and I love the accompanying sweet tomato chutney. The sliders are actually really good and the beef is moist and tender.  Give it a go. There's something for everyone on the menu.

LOVE!! That is the only way to describe how I feel about Zoyo.  - Love: outdoor seats with giant heaters to keep you toasty while eating cold goodness - Love: all the flavors, especially the super simple but perfect vanilla - Love: the toppings, which are fresh, delicious, and seasonal (holiday gummi bears!!) - Love: pricing, which is very reasonable for what you get  Can't wait to go back!

Cool place. Stopped in for a quick drink with friends. I like the decor a lot - wooden log walls and high top seating as well as booths. Separate room with shuffle board and other bar games if that's your thing.  Drinks are reasonably priced and there's enough parking which isn't always the case in this area. I'd go back.

Very good! Reminds me of my mom's cooking.  The chicken karahi is light but very flavorful. The portion is also really large. The chicken tikka masala was very good. I was a little disappointed by the goat biryani - the portion size was good, but the rice was dry. I also thought the raita (accompanying yogurt) was a little bland. The chick pea masala was pretty good, but a little simple for my taste. Still, it was nice that it wasn't drowned in overpowering spices.  The service is slow, but I think the prices are reasonable. I could definitely see this place becoming my go to Indian/Pakistani restaurant in Phoenix.

Yeaaaa! Yummmm!  This Texas girl does enjoy brisket and BBQ sauce, so I am super happy that there's a Rudy's in the Phoenix area.  There's often a line when you go in, but use the time to get familiar with the menu. You can order half pound portions of meat, pick up sides in the fridge by the counter, and grab a beer or other bottled beverage (soda, water, etc.) while standing in line.  Personally, I like getting a brisket sandwich. I usually skip sides since they're just OK and the brisket is more than enough to fill me up. Prices are very reasonable for what you get. The brisket isn't too fatty, the buns are fresh, and the smoky flavor of delicious goodness is awesome.  I like picking up jalapenos and onions before pouring BBQ sauce over my sandwich. If you don't like spicy BBQ sauce, use the sissy version. Regular has a nice little kick if that's what you're into.  Overall, super good. Give Rudy's a go!

I love dessert! This shop is so pretty. All the chocolates, pastries, and gelato are on full display. The strawberry gelato is fantastic; creamy, flavorful, and not too sweet. The chocolate covered strawberries are also really good. The fruit is really ripe and delicious, and the quality of chocolate is nice.  I would definitely stop by again!

What can I say? Dickey's is a staple BBQ joint in Texas. If you like thick cut brisket and BBQ sauce, Dickey's is worth giving a go.  I prefer my brisket sliced (hearty and delicious), usually with a side of jalapeno beans (spicy!), mac and cheese (a good, standard side), waffle fries (fried deliciousness), and their spicy BBQ sauce (yum!!!). The turkey is also pretty good. Regular BBQ sauce is the way to go if you don't want your meal too hot. Rolls are decent; the bread for the brisket sandwich is really good.  I can see this kind of BBQ not being for everyone, but if you like Texas style BBQ, give Dickey's at least one try.

So disappointing. Sochu is located in a shopping strip with plenty of parking. We decided to stop in for happy hour. The restaurant is trying a little too hard in terms of decor - white walls, windows blocked with red and black curtains, purple lights, white tables and chairs. It's nice, but a little over the top for my taste.  After sitting in the restaurant area, we were told happy hour (3-6 pm daily, and reverse from 10:30 to midnight) is only available in the bar. No biggie, we move. After asking for a couple beers and wine that they were out of, we had a couple reasonably priced drinks.  The food was lackluster. I did not enjoy the chicken lollipops - sauce was too thick and had little flavor. Orange puffs were pretty good, a little spicy with plenty of orange flavor, but simple. I did like the Sochu tofu - thought the tofu was fried well and dipping sauces were nice.  After waiting awhile to catch the eye of the bartender, we ordered a couple more drinks and two more tapas. We received the drinks quickly, but after waiting 20 minutes and watching other tables who ordered after us receive their food, we figured we weren't getting more tapas. We flagged down the bartender, paid and left.  Nice concept, but it just wasn't for me.

Cute restaurant. The hummus is really flavorful and delicious, and the bread is super soft and nice. The pita chips are so good but I know they must be awful for you. The grilled eggplant is really good - nice and light and fairly healthy. Prices are reasonable. I'd go back.

Love. I love this place. I hate hyping places up but this is the best Thai I've ever had.  Location: south Phoenix, in a small stand alone building that looks like a house. Ample parking. Not gorgeous from an architectural standpoint but interesting.  Ambiance: very simple inside. Decor is pretty cute. Honestly I liked inside - you can create your own ambiance depending on who you go with.  Service: very good. Everyone is friendly and attentive and my water glass never went empty.  Food: awesome. So fresh, so much great flavor. The pad Thai was so tasty, chicken wasn't dry by any means. Red curry was oozing with coconut milk goodness and basil and tofu. Chicken satay skewers were lightly spiced and juicy. Sticky rice with green tea ice cream was the perfect size and a wonderful end to a wonderful meal. Also loved the small container of super super spicy chilis on each table.  Price: very reasonable.  I will be back!

Really good. Great variety. A little overpriced.  We went for an early dinner, around 5 PM, so we didn't have to wait to get in. The selection is tremendous, for sure. The seafood is really good, my personal favorite being the crawfish. The shrimp, salmon, and tilapia were all worth getting again, too.  The rest of the food was good, some of it very good. The best thing my husband and I tried were the made to order mini tacos. We got a couple with beef, pico, and guacamole. Great flavor and good quality ingredients.  The desserts were really good. I loved the French macarons, as well as the tiramisu, cheesecake pops, and chocolate decadence pops. The mini cupcakes were really dry and disappointing. The red velvet cake was OK.  Overall, I would go back, but for an earlier meal because dinner was expensive. I would recommend trying this buffet at least once.

Very nice that you can eat LGO in the airport before (or after!) a flight. The menu is smaller but the basic core items are there. I enjoyed a light, tasty veggie sandwich. I liked the mix of vegetables and I didn't feel heavy or greasy after eating it. The burgers people were ordering looked delish. My friend got a breakfast sandwich which he thought was pretty good but that the bun was a bit stale. Even though LGO is famous for their buns, we were thinking maybe the airport location doesn't always get to enjoy the super fresh quality that the Arcadia location gets to. Either way, it was still good.  Next time I am at the Phoenix airport I will definitely stop by.

So good!!! Yum. We got a cheese pizza and a sweet potato pizza to go. I love their drive thru window - super convenient for times when you feel lazy.  The sweet potato pizza is delicious - if you like sweet potatoes, try this pizza. The ricotta on top was creamy and complimented the sweet potatoes wonderfully. The crust was buttery and crispy. The cheese pizza was also excellent - really nice blend of flavors.  I feel like getting things to go is never quite as good as eating them in the restaurant. The pizza was so good even after picking it up and letting it get lukewarm in the car that I'm excited about sitting down in the restaurant and having a full meal. Can't wait to go back!

I love Ethiopian food, so I was really excited to try Gojo. The location is easy to find and there's plenty of parking. Restaurant is large, with plenty of seating. It's old, and the decor isn't wonderful, but it's clean and the servers really, really care about giving you a good experience.  We shared the big combo plate: all the veggies, plus 3 meats with injera. Food came out quickly, and was very good. The portion was really large and one combo plate could have easily fed 3 people. I'm not sure if everything was fresh, and it isn't the best Ethiopian I've had, but it was very nice.  If you're new to this kind of cuisine, I suggest trying the doro wott, misir wot, gomen wot, and alitcha wot.  I would definitely come back.

Interesting concept. Think Chipotle or Qdoba, but with enchiladas.  Smashed potatoes as a filling are great - seriously. Doesn't seem like it, but I love them. Short ribs are also yummy. Cornbread is also really, really good, and spicy, so if you have a sensitive stomach, skip it.  Both the red and green salsa are good. I recommend getting it Christmas style unless you have a strong preference for one flavor over the other. All the salsas are good, and I love the pickled onions as a touch of sweetness and freshness to balance the decadence of the short ribs. I like having the buttermilk and jalapeno ranch dressings on the side for a bit of extra flavor.  Prices are reasonable, and I'm always super full for a long time after a meal here. It gets busy during lunch, so stopping by a little early or late can cut down on wait time. Parking is right up front, and there's a patio if you so choose.

Games look pretty fun but there's always a group playing or waiting to play so patience is key. Food ranges from good to great. Not a fan of the drink prices but perhaps that's being nit picky (or cheap!). Try visiting when it's cooler outside while wearing a jacket so you can minimize crowds.

Really good, really interesting take on the concept of shaved ice. I tried the strawberry topped with oreos and chocolate glaze - really sweet, but yummy. I think I like the original shaved ice flavor best. The caramel topping is delicious without being overly sugary. It was also really nice that they use fresh fruit instead of compote.  Snoh is definitely worth a try. I will be back.

So good.  The restaurant is really nice and modern, and the staff is friendly and attentive. We tried the five spice chicken sliders as an appetizer - delicious! I thought the Sriracha mayo would make them really spicy, but it was a nice balance of Sriracha flavor without tons of heat.  The Hell's Kitchen burger is sooo good. The bun is toasted well, the meat is cooked to perfect, and the toppings are great. The American burger was also really good - simple and delicious.  The fries are nice and thick, crispy, and yummy. They're served with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup - fantastic! The curry ketchup is so delicious. I could eat it in place of regular ketchup forever.  I would definitively recommend going. I will be back!

I'm bumping this up to a 4 but I would give 3.5 if I could. The place is big, nice, well lit, and warm enough even at night in the winter. Service is good.  Started with the prosciutto deviled eggs, which I thought were really good, and the roasted beets, which I thought were too simple and disappointing (I would skip them in the future).  Thought the sweet potato kale salad was really great, with a nice amount of goat cheese that was not overwhelming. I do wish they put more strips of sweet potato in the salad, but overall portion size was good.  The grilled chicken club was delicious. Accompanying fries were not very good. I would substitute a different side in the future.  I thought the drink prices were all pretty high. I tried the tap wine - would definitely skip it in the future. Just tasted... Muddled.  This place gets so packed during the summer. I'm glad I could enjoy it without the crowd. I recommend grabbing a jacket during the cool months and giving this place a try.

Gotta love Portillo's. I feel like the best time to go is when you're with a big group, you're looking to save money, and you want something tasty.  Hot dogs have lots of nice toppings, including little spicy peppers. The burger and Italian beef sandwiches are also really good. If you want something healthier, grab a salad. They're all pretty good and come with a yummy poppyseed muffin.

This was great. This restaurant is so pretty inside, and service is very, very good.  Definitely stop in for happy hour. The small plates are reasonably priced, and it's fun ordering several things and sharing with everyone. Love, love, LOVE the duck fat fries. They're delicious, and the egg on top is like icing on the cake. Seriously, where have these fries been all my life?  Truffled deviled eggs are very good. Crispy chicken thighs are fantastic. If you like fried chicken, get this. The thighs are moist, fried perfectly, and just fantastic. Crispy brussel sprout leaves are a nice side to accompany the chicken.  Only thing I would skip are the eggplant fries. They're tender, but they lack flavor. The breading needs some work. They're a good portion size, but I was disappointed, especially since I love eggplant.  For dinner, I had the fish special, and it was amazing. I want to say it was trout. Even if you aren't huge on fish, it's worth gambling to see how good Salty Sow can cook it up.  This place is worth the drive if you don't like in Scottsdale. Cannot wait to go back and eat half the menu.

Ohhh wow. Delicious.  My husband and I love Gallo Blanco, so we had to try Otro Cafe. The location is interesting; the restaurant is open and spacey, which I think I prefer to Gallo, and the seating is more comfortable. I really like that the kitchen is open and you can watch the chefs cook your food. I also think the staff is a little friendlier than at Gallo.  You're served the same two sauces as at Gallo, but you get chips. I also had a one person serving of guacamole, which was so good. Definitely some of the best guacamole I've had. I love that you can order a smaller portion, as my husband doesn't care for guacamole and if it's just the two of us eating Mexican, we don't get guacamole as an appetizer because it ends up being too big a portion. This ended up being perfect.  I had a veggie taco (kale, cauliflower, and squash) and a shrimp taco. My husband had the naco torta. The veggie taco was fantastic - I loved the mix of vegetables and the sauce they used. The shrimp was also excellent, with a really great slaw on top. The naco torta was huge and delicious - perfectly cooked over medium eggs and tender beef. It was rich and delicious.  We didn't intend on getting dessert but we decided to try the coconut pudding. I thought the consistency was a little thin, but it was creamy, smooth, and not too sweet. It was topped with some shaved chocolate which simply added to the richness. A great ending to a great meal.  Loved it! Can't wait to go back and try the other menu items.

Wonderful! After driving by Bink's for months and wishing I was seated at the patio, I was finally able to stop in and enjoy.  You have to valet, so make sure you have some cash on hand. Seating is simple and comfortable - the restaurant is cozy, rustic, and the outdoor patios are shaded nicely with large umbrellas and trees.  Started with a couple baby back ribs and an order of fries. Baby back ribs were messy, yummy, good. Fries were great - I LOVED the aioli and truffle ketchup. Accompanying vert sauce was good, too.  Bacon burger was great. My husband asked for medium, and it was cooked perfectly. He doesn't like pickles at all but the mix of caramelized onion mayo, onion roll, and cheddar balanced perfectly with Lucy's spicy pickles. It was rich without being greasy and heavy.  Chicken salad sandwich was also very good - the perfect lunch sandwich. The onion roll is wonderful, and the chicken salad is hearty without being too heavily weighed down with mayonnaise.  We both got a salad on the side - so wonderful. It's a bowl of mixed green that's incredibly earthy and simple. You can tell all the ingredients are local - they shine with freshness and quality.  I think prices are reasonable for what you get. I did come in with the expectation that I was going to have a decadent, heavy meal. I think what we ordered didn't give us that, but I was in no way disappointed. When you take a good look at the quality and preparation of food at Bink's, it's hard to be disappointed.  Service was good - our waitress was helpful, knowledgeable, and prompt. I am excited to go back!

First BBQ place we've tried in Phoenix, and we were not disappointed!  Bootleggers is located in a small shopping strip with lots of parking. The restaurant is really well decorated. We had the nachos as an appetizer - awesome! The meat was tender, and the cheese, avocados, and onions just added to the delicious richness. They were a little greasy, but they're nachos - what else am I expecting?  BBQ brisket sandwich was really good. I liked the strong cheese that they paired with the sweet BBQ sauce. The bun was really nice and buttery. Upgraded the potato chips to the fries, which were a little salty, but good. I might forgo the upgrade in the future and stick with the chips.  The brisket plate had a nice, large slab of beef covered in BBQ sauce. The sauce is a little sweet for my taste (I prefer a little more tangy), but the beef was tender and yummy. The accompanying tortillas were surprisingly delicious - super soft, warm, with a wonderful texture and flavor. The coleslaw was pretty good, and I did like that it wasn't weighed down with tons of mayo. Added the green beans, which were cooked perfectly and had a great touch of citrus.  Service was awesome. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back to try a burger and some moonshine.

I love the old church that houses Taco Guild. It's such a pretty, unique dining experience that if nothing else, try this place out to enjoy the ambiance. Luckily, the food delivers, so you aren't just enjoying eye candy at Taco Guild.  I like that the tortilla chips are warm when they're served, and the accompanying salsa is fresh and delicious. My husband and I started with the Guild Duo - guacamole and queso. The queso was great, with fresh tomatoes and cilantro. The guacamole was good, though a little lightly seasoned for my personal taste. The portion size was big, though, so I can't complain too much.  We tried the guild chicken taco, vegetable taco, and molida lamb  taco. The chicken was really nice, with a touch of sweetness. I could see this becoming my favorite go to taco at Taco Guild. The veggie was great, with wonderfully seasoned vegetables. The molida lamb was rich and delicious. Make sure you like blue cheese before ordering this, and I would suggest only ordering one because it's rich and heavy. The lamb was moist and wonderful - really liked this taco. We also had the beer battered onion jalapeno straws, which were your standard fried goodness, but nothing spectacular to write home about. I think I'll try the corn next time.  I think the prices were pretty reasonable, and the service was good. Parking was easier than I thought it would be. I would forgo turning in from Osborn but instead turn in from 7th St behind Taco Guild and Starbucks.  I will definitely be back to try more tacos.

Amazing burger!  We stopped in for the Wednesday night special (burger and draft for $10). The restaurant is open, with neat decor and a nice ambiance. Service was good, too. The burgers were perfectly cooked (we asked for medium). The veggies were fresh and crisp, and the pretzel bun, though a little salty, was a great accent. Fries were fresh and fried to perfection. Our server was super nice and let my glass of wine count as part of the Wednesday special.  I really want to try their other stuff, like the pizzas, but if nothing else, try the burger. So, so good!

Such a cute little shop. There's a nice extensive wine section and you can enjoy a bottle in the shop or to go.  We tried the beignets and they were AMAZING. I cannot emphasize how good they were. Go on a day where you don't care about your diet and just enjoy these gorgeous, fried, delicious, magical treats. You get three in an order, and you can easily split the order with two other people so that you each get one.  We got a baguette to go which was also delish. I really want to try their dine in menu and other dessert items.

I always like Whole Foods. Some are better than others, but it's never a disappointing experience.  I love that this store sells ROCQ macarons - so delicious! And reasonably priced. The bakery also has a good selection of bread loaves - more varieties available than many of the other stores in the Phoenix/Mesa area.  I really like the bar aspect of this store, though the recent opening has made it a bit too busy for me to try. I'll wait until things become less chaotic.  Staff is friendly and helpful. I do think the store is a bit small and cramped, but it's well stocked, so I can't complain too much. Overall, very nice.

Surprisingly good. I thought with the fast, design your own pizza strategy, the product would suffer, but I was definitely wrong. You get to pick out your own toppings and sauce, and the pizza is cooked very quickly. Price is very reasonable, and the quality is very good.  This location is a bit hard to find, but I definitely suggest stopping by and giving Fired Pie a try. It's affordable, fast, and yummy. Next visit I want to try a salad in addition to a new pizza combination.

The Gladly is delicious. I stopped in with some friends during restaurant week and we all decided to try different entrees to maximize our experience.  We all did start with the chopped salad, which I had never had. It was wonderful. I loved the combination of couscous, salmon, black currants, pepitas, and asiago.  One friend had the pan seared scallops - very nice. Another had the duck meatloaf - decadent and yummy. I had a special they added, which was the rockfish - amazing. I think my friends were a bit jealous of my dish and kept sneaking bites. Theirs were very good, but the rockfish was fantastic.  For dessert we had white chocolate blondie and the blueberry maple bread pudding. Blondie was excellent - not too sweet with a bit of lovely ice cream. Bread pudding was also nice and very rich.  Service was good. Restaurant is nice, modern, comfortable. I was really impressed and will definitely be back.

I don't usually write reviews for chains but this Starbucks is bad. The drive thru is remarkably inefficient, and I once literally waited 30+ minutes for the 3 cars in front of me. They're just so slow and that's not the point of a drive thru!  They also run out of things. I'm not taking a cookie or cupcake. They'll be out of syrups for standard drinks (on a regular basis).  There's other Starbucks locations I would rather go to. Visit at your own risk!

Interesting little pub in Whole Foods. I really like that they have a large selection of local beers on tap, and a good variety of wine and cocktails. Beer flights for $8 are also a good way to sample a bunch of different beers  They also serve food, which is basically the Whole Foods hot prepared foods served at a table. There's pizzas, sandwiches, sushi, and a handful of other items. Prices are reasonable. I really like the tater tots - crispy exterior, soft interior, with a delicious dipping sauce. Orange chicken with brown rice is a good value considering the portion size. Sushi is a bit overpriced, which I would recommend skipping in favor of a sandwich.  It's a fun place to chill when you're looking for something different and low key. The staff are friendly and efficient. I wouldn't mind stopping in again.

Yummmm. I'm surprised to find such good Vietnamese food in Chandler but what can I say? This place is great.  Lots of parking in the strip mall. Lots of seating in a big restaurant. Decor is simple and what you'd expect from an authentic place that focuses on flavor. I loved the 70s Beegees soundtrack playing in the back.  Vermicelli bowl with beef was so delish. The beef was tender and well seasoned. Loved the fresh mint mixed amongst the fresh greens. Portion was big and I was very  full after just half the bowl. I sampled dishes my friends ordered and each was wonderful and flavorful.  Prices are reasonable, and service is good. I will be back! If you like Vietnamese food, this is where you need to eat.

Stopped in for dinner one night with some friends. Inside the restaurant is self seat, I believe, and it was packed, so we sat outside under some misters.  Bartender was pretty attentive. He was good on getting us drinks and taking orders. We started with some wings, which were fine. Not a big wing person, but my friends are, and they liked them. We also had some fries as a starter, which were pretty good. Not extraordinary, but I enjoyed them.  I had the lamb vindaloo pasty, which tasted like a premade Indian flavored dish was stuffed into the pasty and frozen, then baked for me after I ordered. Not great. Chicken Greek pasty was WAY too heavy on the olives, even for my olive loving husband. Did not enjoy that one at all.  Prices for the pasties are a bit high, in my opinion. I don't think I would go back, but I do think the concept of the restaurant is interesting and in cooler weather, the patio would be really nice.

NICE! I like it! I love the round building and outdoor patio. There's plenty of shade and a few seats inside, too. Parking can be limited but there's spaces just down the block.  Sangria is awesome. Seriously, so yummy. Pitcher is a great value during happy hour, but make sure you have plenty of people to share with. I thought the shattered potato chips were really good. I loved the hummus and pumpkin seed dips. Hummus was good, but the pumpkin seed dip was unusual and delicious. The accompanying fresh veggies were of a nice variety. Burger was nice but a little heavy on the relish.  Service is good. I'd like to come back and try a few other things. I saw someone order the kale and quinoa salad and it looked delish.

My love letter to Ingo's:  INGO'S! I love you. Your food is so amazing and delicious. Burgers are cooked to a perfect medium and seasoned so well. Egg salad is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Perfect for brunch. Kale and quinoa salad is so light and refreshing. Sangria is lovely, especially in the beast that is Phoenix weather. Deviled eggs, shattered potato chips, and hummus and pumpkin seed dip - best way to start a meal. Ice cream sandwich cookies and complimentary sea salt chocolate chip cookies - even better way to end a meal. Super fun seating with nice shade. FAST AND EFFICIENT SERVICE! Good prices. Good food. Fin.

Love this dog park. There's two separate parks - one for big dogs and one for small dogs. Both have benches and picnic tables for sitting, and the small dog park has a nice little ledge along the grassy area for additional seating.  There's a few different trash cans, a community pooper scooper, and lots of free bags available if you forgot to bring something to clean up after your pet. There's also a doggie water fountain and a second for humans if they get thirsty.  Lots of parking, and it has some good lighting. I think this is my new favorite dog park in the Central Phoenix area.

As with the Hula's on Central, Hula's in Scottsdale is quite nice. I like that it's located slightly off Scottsdale Road so it doesn't seem as intensely busy. I like the layout of the restaurant a lot, and the service is good. As always, can't go wrong with a mai tai. I also like the tofu tacos and their Caesar salad is delish.  If you're touring restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale, give Hula's a go.

I am becoming a big fan of Upward Projects. I love Windsor, Federal Pizza, Churn, and Postino. Now I can add Joyride to the list.  Parking is much easier with the addition of the lot next to Windsor. You can also park along the street right next to Joyride if it isn't peak meal time. There's several doors around the perimeter of the building; someone will gladly point you to the host/hostess.  You can sit at a table, at the bar, or at a community table. Restaurant is large, has nice geometric patterns on the walls, and there's interesting light fixtures by the bar.  Chips and salsa: thin crispy warm chips yum, and delish spicy salsa  Cheese y mas: lots of nice fresh toppings on a bed of warm queso; simple flavor and really good  Veggie and goat cheese enchiladas: a little limited on the veggies in the enchiladas, and a lot of goat cheese so if you aren't a fan, get chicken. Also, no sides. That being said, the verde sauce is tangy and delish, and everything is well seasoned for a delightful harmony of flavors in your mouth.  The beast: made it enchiladas style with verde sauce. Delicious, tender beef and a nice mix of beans and avocado inside.  Good drink specials, as with all the Upward Projects restaurants. I can't wait to try the agua frescas and margaritas.

Eh. Stopped in one Saturday afternoon for drinks after visiting some of the noisier places in Old Town Scottsdale. Only my friend was seated at the table - I was in the bathroom and my husband and my friend's boyfriend were outside, so out waitress only brought one water glass. When she saw the rest of our party she said she would bring more water glasses but I guess she forgot.  I had a bloody mary, which was a little spicy and pretty good. My friend had a couple different margaritas, each which she thought were fine. She was able to get one for only $1 after checking in at Salty Senorita on foursquare. My husband and friend's boyfriend had beer; the beer selection was pretty limited so if you don't like Negro Modelo I would stick to a cocktail or wine.  I thought the salsa was good, and the chips were fresh and crispy. The guacamole was extremely salty. It was edible, but seriously salty. After passing the one water glass around the table a few times, we flagged down our server for the bill and left.  I don't think I would go back, but we had a nice time despite the poor service and food. If you have some serious time on your hands and like salt, you might like Salty Senorita.

Very nice. Stopped in one afternoon for a couple beers. We also had the burrata as an appetizer. The arugula was fresh and bitter, the burrata was creamy and decadent, the tomato jam was sweet and tasty, and the bread was crispy and delicious. All together, it was a perfect combination. It was a great accompaniment to our drinks.  Service was good. I wish we were hungrier because the menu looked great. I will definitely be back.

This place is so disgusting.  We needed a pet friendly room last minute, so we tried not to be too picky. After price shopping, The Quad was a more affordable option, so we decided to give it a try and make the best of it despite the poor reviews. Why oh why didn't we heed everyone's warnings?  I called a day before to make sure that early check was an option, and what the cost was. Normal check in is 4 PM, but we arrived around 1:15 PM or so. After finding a parking spot in a small, cramped, poorly marked parking garage, we made our way through the construction and cramped space to the front desk. I'm fine with paying the early check in fee, but our room wasn't ready. This option should not be offered if the hotel cannot honor it. We ended up sitting in our car running the AC for an hour so that our dog wouldn't get overheated.  We were put in a pet designated room, which was hard to find, and which absolutely stank of animal urine. The bathroom also reeked of sewage. The carpets were dirty, as other people mentioned, and the furniture was old and dingy. The bathroom was crusty and gross. The bedsheets looked OK (no obvious, visible black marks like others have mentioned), but I wasn't happy sleeping there.  The next morning, after checking out and making our way out of the parking garage, we saw that a pipe burst on the ground level and that there was some flooding. My husband asked someone directing traffic what to do; the man very rudely replied that if we decided to drive over the water, it was our responsibility to cover any damage. My husband then asked what he recommended, to which he replied that we go back, park, and wait 2 hours. This wasn't an option for us, so after watching a couple other cars cross, we did, too.  Don't stay here! There are other pet friendly hotels, both on and off the strip, that are better than this. Even if you're just looking for a cheap place to sleep late at night while spending all the rest of your time in Vegas at nicer places, do not stay here.

Really nice, small restaurant with a great menu. Chips and salsa are nice too spicy in my opinion but pack a lot of flavor. Enchiladas de rez are delicious - the beef is so tender and the sauce is wonderful. Backyard carne asada steak is super tender - cooked a perfect medium rare, and again, so flavorful and delicious.  The rice and beans are all done nicely and compliment the main food items wonderfully. Happy hour menu is a bit different, so I am looking forward to going back and giving it a try.

I'm from Texas, and there's a lot of people from Louisiana who relocate and open up good eats. Therefore, I've had a good amount of delicious Cajun food. I was craving some here in Phoenix, so I thought I'd give Baby Kay's a try.  It's located in a shopping strip with a good amount of parking. The restaurant is big, simple in decor, and there are a couple of servers. I feel like they need at least one more person helping out in the dining room because service was very slow, although when she did stop by our table, she was very good.  We started with the hush puppies, which were a good portion size for the price, but the spices seemed to be lacking. I know hush puppies are usually a simple batter deep fried to perfection, but these were nothing to write home about.  Shrimp etouffee was pretty good. I like that the shrimp were fresh, not frozen, and that there were lots of them. Accompanying rice did not seem fresh, though. Chicken po-boy with BBQ sauce was very boring and not worth the price, but unfortunately that's to be expected of non-seafood dishes in seafood restaurants.  I think the spices were kind of lacking all around, and the service was slow. Prices were kind of high, but at least the seafood is fresh. It wasn't worth the drive for me. Don't think I'll be back.

Yes! So happy there's a location closer to where I live. It's located in a shopping strip - it's across the street from The Vig and around the corner from TEXAZ Grill. It's small, but it's got the same charm and feel of the Scottsdale location. Staff are friendly and nice.  The malt chocolate chip is awesome. Strawberry sorbet is a delicious way to go if you want something lighter. Coconut sorbet is wonderful, too. Chocolate shake is delish, though a bit thin so if you like your shakes thick you might want to ask them to go light on the milk. Still, it's rich and fantastic.  Yum yum yum... can't wait to go back.

Love Frost in Gilbert. Almost fainted when I found out Frost opened a location in the Biltmore which is MUCH closer to me.  The Biltmore can be a pain to walk around when it's 110+ outside, so if you're only there to grab a scoop and go, it's located off Camelback a few stores from Zinburger.  Texture is so creamy and smooth. Flavors are so delicious. I always love stracciatella, but amaretto and panna cotta are also great. Cappuccino and salted caramel are also fantastic. Strawberry sorbetto and kiwi sorbetto are delish and good for the days I'm feeling calorie conscious.  I like that the people working there walk around offering glasses of water and additional samples. It just makes the entire experience all the more fun.

Just like the other Vig locations in terms of food and decor. Service is really good. Brunch is yummy - I recommend the french toast. I like all of the sandwiches I've tried and the hummus as an appetizer is really nice. There's cocktail specials on the weekend if you want to get boozy during brunch.

What do you do when you want something sweet? You go to The Pie Hole and pick either 1. an entire pie, 2. a slice of pie, 3. a mini pie. Or if you want something savory, there's a few options available!  Chocolate pie is awesome. Crust is great, and the filling is so creamy and smooth. Whipped cream isn't too sweet, which is great to balance out the super sweetness of the chocolate center.  I really want to try, oh say, every other type of pie they have. I will be back.

Disappointing. The restaurant is very nicely decorated, and the service is pretty good. I was expecting good to great food since it's owned by the same people who run Fez and Switch. Had a salad which I thought had way too much cheese on it. Unfortunately I can't remember the name but I expect really fresh, beautiful ingredients in a salad. These ingredients were fresh, but everything was just so... blah. It felt like a salad I could make at home.  Husband had the corduroy burger which was cooked over what he wanted. It was pretty good, but again, nothing remarkable that made him think YES WE SHOULD COME BACK!  I'd be willing to give it another go since we only tried two things off their menu and again, it's owned by people who have some pretty yummy restaurants in Phoenix. It might take me a little convincing, though.

Portillo's brings the taste of Chicago to Phoenix. The restaurant itself is a bit chaotic - there's several lines, and no matter what time of day you go, it's busy. People huddle around the pick up counter, which can be irritating. On the upside, the food is cheap and tasty. I love the Portillo hot dog - the toppings are awesome and the chilis are hot! The burgers and salads are pretty good, too. The poppyseed muffin is delicious - so soft, sweet, and tasty.  Give Portillo's a try when you're on a budget and have some patience. Cheap + delicious = awesome.
