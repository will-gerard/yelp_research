I'm just got my two wisdom teeth pulled out a day before this review. I went in for an evaluation and on the first day the oral surgeon said we can take them out now and it will be done in fifteen minutes.with waiting time and X-rays the whole process lasted two hours so pretty quick. The process cost me about $595 and I used a discount plan not insurance. This is with the cheaper local anesthesia. So all in all I think, it was a good deal, but I longer have pain and it's only been a day...djdndbksn

Pompous owner/manager, this guy thinks he might be starting a new innovative trend for breakfast. What is really happening is distance and separation from valued customers. A member of a party can not join mid meal. People will be ignored and feel disowned if the  party is incomplete ( you will not be seated, and will feel punished for it).  I feel nepotism is being used here; we were not spoken to once seated. I'm entitled to a nice welcome but was embarrassed by the lack of communication.  The manager reminded us that we needed to finish up and start leaving, so he can seat more people; fuck you! I want to eat comfortably, I didn't order no food to go. If you wanted things to be like this you should throw the food in a blender and turn the whole place into a quick drive through.!  Couldn't see past the rudeness to actually taste what could have been a painless enjoying meal.

This place is very family friendly with one thing in mind, to serve their customers with upmost respect and highest concerns.  They help you fix, clean the jewelry you have, resize as well and in minutes.   They have quite the valuable and rare collections from many southwest tribes.promise me, you will not find a duplicate anywhere else!  I enjoy coming here and enjoy the the family that takes care of you while searching for that specific rarity.  Come here you won't be disappointed!

tasty! Inexpensive and a daily favorite.  This place is like your neighborhood restaurant, This place is frequently visited by plenty of workers, students and they are all usual's; that is a sign that this place is incredibly  delicious and consistently successful. The hot sandwiches are filling and savoring, try the rueben, or the pizza sub. The salads are big and very fresh. This place is a weekly default and i dont get tired of eating here!

This bar is my guilty pleasure; without feeling so guilty. To summarize, I have a connection to this bar as Jerry Sienfield had a connection to his coffee shop. Not a fancy place but it works.  Now for newcomers, this place offers great bands almost everyday of the week. -onThursdays they have a small weekly event of painting and rap shows called blunt club; ten years and running.  -On Mondays they have small games where you can win beer gift cards for 20-50$! This place has pool tables and in the next room they have bands playing. The days range from punks to "hipsters" to rockers, rappers, no yuppies, older crowd to younger crowds; this bar has rare sightings of your typical ASU student.  I enjoy meeting some weird people here and it gets to be quite weird at times! All in all  It's just an easy place to get comfortable...

Very good food! Nice variety!  Only problem and quite minuscule problems too; they took quite a bit of time to get us seated, the food took quite a bit of time too and they brought us food all at different times which was disorganized. Other than that the waiters and employees were very attentive and gave us COMPLIMENTARY EDAMAME ! Always a plus! So in fact I give them 4 out of 5 since it was Sunday and supposedly it's busy on Sunday's

I came in for the first time on 12/16/13 to check the place out. I came in while talking on the phone an the employees seemed to notice it while I was searching. Once I got off after 15 min I was immediately attended to; even though there was a decent amount of people being helped.  I was searching for shoes for another person, asking plenty of questions for that particular person and each was answered.   I then was curious about the shoe dog, foot test. He tested me knowingly I didn't want to buy anything but the fact that I was curious. He was very knowledgable with how I tend supinate my foot and used the correct terms. I enjoyed it and I look forward to shopping here again if I get the same service.

Beware the ides of March  This car wash was only supposed to be 30 minutes at most, it took two hours?   They didn't even vacuum when all was finished. The people also did not wipe the dirt from the dashboard.  To add insult to injury I went in and helped the guy vacuum and clean. I may be a neat freak, but If I spent 63 dollars on a VIP car wash and head light buffer; I expect the best!  Last but not least they scratched my paint by buffing carelessly, Disappointed!

When someone asks me where to eat in town, my default answer is the vig.  The vig; uptown, definitely has my heart.  The stylish interior sets the perfect mood during the day for a relaxing meal, or at night if you're looking for the nightlife.   The meals are simple yet exquisite to the taste. If you're having trouble choosing a meal, go for the hot chick. The Hot chick consist of a great tasting spicy chicken sandwich; I'll leave the rest of the description for your taste buds.  The drinks are cheap and one of the best in the city. I had a gin cucumber, the bartender recommended me and I adopted this drink as my go to favorite.

Great place to hang out! It's not just a store it's like an authentic arcade; so these guys are bringing it back just more effectively. They even have a game room in the back that lets you try out new consoles and games. This is how arcade stores should be.  The games they have,range from new games to old school games that are a rarity; so yes they may be pricey. These guys buy,sell and trade whatever you guys have;as long as it works.  The guys are great and really know their stuff.

Ahead of the curve!   I hate getting haircuts so I reverted to giving my own to save the pain and hassle!  Point being said I enjoy coming here. The crew they have are experts, creatively ground breaking in not just the way they cut hair but the way they setup their shop and the way they serve the community.   The shop is simplistically built with the mind set of less is more. The art setup around the shop compliments the the shops negative space and gives the look of being in a different city than the one outside.   When you're done with your haircut you might get the feeling of being in a magazine shoot. Being in a shop that has many spots to take your picture of your hair and a sheik background.   This place not only offers haircuts but offers a gallery for artists around the valley. On some nights( like first Fridays) the shop turns into a whole different venue/gallery. This is a place to find the best artists around the valley that may seem hidden to the naked eye.   As you can tell I found my niche of hair salons and I look forward to being  a regular; also looking forward to not giving my self haircuts and bad ones for that matter.

Pretty sure I came in with four metal caps ! Who "misplaces" these and replaces them with different colored plastic covers?! Also not a fan of the extreme attempt of up selling me  when I went to a discount tire company by Indian bend and was told my tires are fine. Hmmmm, not a fan of this discount tire location

Just tried the gumbo here at southern rail. Not too heavy, just right with shredded chicken and sausage . The place has a simple southern style and has plenty of space. next door offers a different bar- coffee shop with a neat book store full of knick knacks  and what nots. Also there's plenty of space for studying. It's kind of a shame it's not more packed, perhaps it's due to the fact that it's Thursday. All I know is I'll be coming more to try out more food and drinks
