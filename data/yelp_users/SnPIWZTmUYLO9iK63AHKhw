Been here several times and always am greeted with a smile. Love that the servers and hosts go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need and are satisfied with your dining experience. The fried chicken is so good and I'd definitely recommend having it smothered. They even have Kool-Aid. If you're in Vegas and you love soul food and service with a smile M&M is the way to go!

Made the mistake of thinking this would be cool like every other MAC store I've ever been in. Disorganized situation, cashier neglects to call me over while I'm clearly waiting in line. Then helps someone ahead of me. When I call it out a rude "make up artist" tries to give me attitude. Woman named Mollie tries to justify Amanda's attitude and the cashier's unwillingness to serve me. Will be calling on Monday to speak with a manager. Maybe I'm not welcomed because I'm not a woman or white. Either way it'll be addressed on Monday. Because of the marketing I've always assumed MAC was gay friendly. Maybe I was wrong or maybe this store didn't get the memo. Expected better.
