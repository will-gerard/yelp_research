Don't waste your money or your time at this place. My husband and I bought 3 details and they managed to screw up every single one! We complained and they gave us a few free car washes. They can't even do that right. Every time I go I hope and cross my fingers that the service has changed and I am always disappointed. I used my last free car wash (crappy) today. They missed coffee on the console dirt on the doors dirty windshield and a lousy vacuum job. Bye bye for good...

I am usually so happy with this place that I am legitimately upset writing this. When you pay $70 for a pedicure and manicure it should be decent. Not chunky and messy. Then when you politely ask them to fix it, they all start talking in Vietnamese and giving ME a dirty look...I was and always have been a great client and good tipper...no more...I would rather pay an extra $40 and go somewhere else that takes pride in their work and doesn't make you feel like an ass for wanting to receive what you pay for...so disappointed.

I have been going to Jenelle for quite some time now. I love the way she takes care of me and how my hair is always exactly the way I love it! She is so knowledgeable and easy to talk to. She makes every experience at her salon an enjoyable and relaxing one. I would recommend her to any and all for hair. She does awesome color and extentions that I can't imagine going anywhere else. It's hard to find such a dedicated and top notch stylist who truly cares about her clients wants and needs. She is my fave!!!
