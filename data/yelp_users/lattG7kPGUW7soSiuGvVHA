This is honestly the best pizza I've had since moving to Arizona in 2011. I'm telling you... this stuff is like crack. Trust me. Pay the extra couple bucks for for a large pie - it's about $20. You won't regret it.

The workers here are very friendly but EXTREMELY slow. I've been going to Jiffy Lube for a very long time and have never seen service this slow. This location took almost an hour and a half for a routine oil change with only two people in front of me. I will not be coming back to this specific location.

I've lived in many different apartment complexes over the years and I can honestly say this has been without a doubt the best apartment community I have ever inhabited.   The staff is awesome. If there was ever an issue with anything, they would immediately respond back to my email requests saying they were on top of it. The maintenance crew is fantastic and very professional as well. Also, a few times a year the staff invites all the residents to the clubhouse for food, prizes and drinks. Fun theme parties: Hawaiian, Halloween, Pizza, Octoberfest, etc.   I currently live in a 3rd floor studio, which faces the 101 and it's dead silent. I've lived here almost 2 years now and have yet to hear a neighbor. That's the most amazing part about this place for me.   Pros: - Very well built (I used to do construction so I know when corners are cut and quality materials are used) - Huge walk-in closet with shoe racks - Ceiling fan, stainless steel appliances, ice maker and filtered water in fridge, large tub, granite counter tops, great layout for studio - 1-min from 101, 2-mins to 51, 4-mins from Desert Ridge, 6-mins to City North, 18-mins to Old Town (GPS timed) - Very quiet, good neighbors, not many kids - Rent can be paid online  Cons:  - $25 per/mo mandatory garbage PU charge - Gym is very small and lacking equipment - Rent is jacked up every time lease is renewed - Pool only gets sunshine during morning hours and is surrounded by the units - Parking spots are open to almost everyone (even the covered spots). This is good and bad. Good when you have visitors, but bad when you can't find a spot. The only time I usually had trouble is on Sat nights.
