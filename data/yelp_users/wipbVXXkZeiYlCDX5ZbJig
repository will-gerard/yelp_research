I am always a big fan of a place in Phoenix that is a BYOB. There aren't many around. I'm not a fan of the typical mark up on wines. Corkage is $10. I am not usually one for ordering soup, especially in 110 degree weather. I had the tortilla soup. I was very impressed. At $6 this is a real bargain. It was packed full of veggies and chicken, more like a stew than a soup. Our entrees last night were the Filet Mignon and the pork tenderloin. The Filet was cooked perfectly to order. The accompanying potatoes were tasty with a hint of citrus I believe. The pork was equally as good. The goat cheese on top was a nice addition. I have been here before and had less stellar meals. Surprisingly their specialty, the lamb shank, was not very impressive. It was not nearly as tender as it should have been. A shank should have the meat nearly falling off the bone. Ironically I have never had a dessert here so i can not comment on that.

Best Cajun food in AZ hands down.  They serve all the usuals, etouffee, gumbo, jambalaya, etc. This is genuine stuff here. The jambalaya is the true rice dish. No tomato or noodles. Gumbo is the best! Cajun shrimp are great and worth getting more garlic bread to sop up the sauce with. Hushpuppies are a good alternative to fries the green olive coleslaw. The Boudin balls are worth trying if you've never had them.

Great food. Always prompt. Service is good. The cheap margaritas are decent for 1.75. I've had tamales on 3 different occasions here and I cant say I have enjoyed any of them. There always ends up being a dry and hard on one end. Not sure what the issue is/was. the last time I had one there they covered it a green chile sauce. I think to rehydrate maybe. But everything else I've had has been excellent. The gyro meat platter thing is a little odd though.

This is my go to place for great Asian food. Its priced reasonably. The quality is excellent. Top marks for the Teriyaki  chicken and the fried rice. The Teriyaki chicken is not the usual sweet stuff. Its a hearty almost beef broth like flavor. I'm a huge fan of the friend rice as well. I've had numerous beef dishes. The meat is always super tender. The staff is super nice, very attentive, always quick to take your order or get a drink. Its never busy for dinner either. With a restaurant.com certificate it makes the deal even better.

Obviously if you are coming here you are expecting an exemplary dining experience and top notch steaks. They did not disappoint. My steak was cooked perfectly. My guests steak was slightly overcooked. Not enough to send it back though. Sides were excellent as well. Veggies were cooked perfectly slightly 'al dente'. The au gratin potatoes were great, not too heavy with cheese. Another guest at our table had lobster. It was what lobster should be like. Lobster can be overcooked so easily. This was not. Very tender and sweet. It is cleaned from the shell at the table for you by your server. Nice touch. Our server was very experienced and it showed. Her knowledge of the wine list and wines in general was beyond expectations. This dinner was for my birthday. The sent out a complimentary creme brulee. Which leads me to my one and only complaint. The custard were perfect. The brulee had obviously been done long before serving. It was not the hard candy crust it should have been. One very tiny fault, but a very easy one to remedy. Overall an excellent evening. I give it 4 stars due to desert and quality versus price ratio.

I have driven by here countless times and never noticed it. Why I have no idea. Its a beautiful place. Very modern and upscale. Its a good looking crowd and trendy. The food was good, but not amazing. I had a hanger steak and my guest had the pot roast. The steak was cooking to my request. Not as tender as I would have hoped, not for a prime cut at least. The pot roast was moist and tender. The high point of the evening was the potato appetizer. Quite tasty and a bargain at 6 bucks. I could be happy going for happy hour with a drink and the potatoes. Service was excellent. I will be back.

This has become my standard for all sushi to be judged. I have not had a bad item here. Rainbow carpaccio is a must try. Its sashimi of 4 or 5 different fish with a cucumber relish. Prices are moderate but with a free BYOB its easy to overlook that. The tempura is light and prefectly crisp. I've only had one noodle dish I think. So I cant judge too well based on that. But what I had was excellent. Service is always great.

This has become my go to restaurant for burgers. It all started with just wanting a cheap burger alternative to fast food. Mondays their burgers are $5.55. Great! Little did I know it would become my favorite burger ever! I'm referring to the Switch house burger. Ordered medium rare it come out a perfect pink inside and super juicy. Only once has it not come out as ordered and they were happy to take care of it for me. I have had other dishes there that were very good. They have food and drink specials every day. Very reasonable prices and excellent service.

First off I will say the food that arrived was very good. I have eaten here countless times before with no issue whatsoever. In fact this was our go-to restaurant for burger night for a very long time. I really like this restaurant. The issue I had recently was not of food but the incredibly horrible service we had. Our waitress, I think her name was Deena, started off by forgetting to bring a cocktail over from the bar for me. No big deal really. The second strike was then when we were ready to order she asked immediately what appetizers can I start you off with. I didn't ask about any nor was I interested in any. She almost seemed disgusted that we didn't order any. I understand servers make more money in tips when the bill is more but don't be so pushy about trying to fluff up the bill with add-ons. This still wasn't a big deal but it was worth noting. Almost an hour after being seated the waitress came to the table with the side salads that usually come with the burger and she apologized that there was some error with the order and that the burgers would be out shortly. She apologized again and said she would take one of the meals off the bill and the manager or chef would be over in a moment. I asked for another drink and then she offered to take care of that also. Another server ended up bringing over my guests drink as our waitress had forgotten about that one also. The burgers finally arrived minus the mayo I had asked for the side of fries I ordered. After we were finished with the meal our waitress asked if we would like dessert. We were both full and didn't even finish our burgers. This was now a 2 hour dinner. We just wanted to leave. So we declined dessert and said we were full and just wanted the check. She insisted she bring us a dessert for the evenings problems. I asked for it in a to-go box, like I said we were both full. After about 10 minutes it arrived and then she finally brought the check. She stated she only charged me for the burgers and one drink each. I opened the bill and stared for a moment processing what she had just said and then asked "so you just comped one drink?" Her reply was she had also taken off the dessert. I couldn't believe she had the tenacity to even say that. I hadn't even asked for the dessert! At this point I was fairly pissed and also amazed of the things she had said earlier in the meal had just slipped her mind at this point. So I asked if that's all she planned on doing and her reply was I can talk to the manager for you. It wasn't like I was asking for something over and above what she had stated. But she made it out like I was the one being a pain in her ass. By that point I was furious and just wanted to leave, this is now almost 2 1/2 hrs after first arriving! I handed her my credit card and said do whatever you need to. She came back after some time and handed me back my credit card and said here you go we aren't charging you anything. Before I left I asked what was the problem with the order and why it was so late. She replied she did not know. The manager or the chef never came over at any time after the problem. They were definitely not too busy. In fact the chef had been socializing at the very next table to us with friends. If the manager had come over I'm sure I wouldn't be writing this. Have you ever heard of a problem bad enough to comp a meal or service where a manager does not come over to apologize or see what the problem was? Me neither. It will be a while before I come back and if I do I will stick with a different server.

I'll keep it simple. We had a couple burritos and chicken tacos. The burritos were good, quite large. But the chef/cook could mix the ingredients a little. Both our burritos had one ingredient on one end and another on the opposite end etc etc. The tacos were piles high with chicken. I have no idea how a person is supposed to eat them with any toppings. There was that much chicken. The restaurant itself is a dive. But ya dont come here for that. Its all about the food. Reasonably priced, especially with a restaurant.com certificate. I will go back soon. I'm anxious to try the tortas.

The tacos are awesome, and quite reasonable during happy hour. I prefer the beef and the veggie. I've had the shrimp a couple times and they are usually overcooked and a little rubbery. I like the pork, my friends didn't like them as much as I did. The fish tacos change with the fish that's currently available. A MUST try is the guacamole. Its a little pricey at $8 but only $5 during happy I think.

This was my second experience with Hula's for brunch. Another big disappointment. I had the big breakfast sandwich. It does look really good. I ordered it specifically from seeing it on a table next to us. My companion had the hangover hash. Both were a big let down. I had the hash before so I was not surprised at that. The hashbrowns that accompanied it was I think probably the worst I have had, quite rubbery and tough. Its apparent that they had been cooked earlier in the day and kept warm until needed and maybe kissed the flattop before serving. The bread of my sandwich received similar treatment. It was toasted some time previous to serving. But by the time the bread hit the table it had lost any hint of being toasted. It looked toasted but it was soft as any plain white bread fresh out of a bag and bland. Maybe a brioche would have been a better choice. The sandwich overall was fairly bland. It could have used a little kick. Some better cheese maybe, or more flavorful bacon. Thankfully a couple slices of tomato saved the day. I will say the mimosas are cheap. Only $2 a glass. Kudos for that. Service was excellent. Very attentive. And the ambiance is great. If I hadn't tried the hashbrowns this time I may have given it 3 stars but I gotta knock em down to 2 stars due to the poor taste.

I have to say first that this was one of the most enjoyable dinners I have had. My guest and I sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen. What a great choice. Eric, the chef/owner was very personable and happy to chat and explain everything, cooking tips, wine pairings, anything. We spent nearly 3 hours there on a Thursday night. Michelle, Eric's fiance, was happy to offer up information and tips as well. We ordered stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto to start. They are popped in the wood oven just long enough to char the outside edges a little. To me, anything wrapped in prosciutto is a very good thing. But these come with a cheddar tarragon sauce that just sings. They give you more than enough cheddar sauce you will want to keep to dip bread, or in our case pizza crust in. We followed up with 2 pizzas, a classic Margherita and a salami and artichoke. Both were excellent. Very thin, crisp, almost cracker like at the edge, think Pizzeria Bianco. We also ordered a chocolate pastry dessert filled with raspberry and cheese. I'm not a huge dessert person so I am not the best judge. I thought it was very good though. We did get to sample numerous other dishes that were all amazing. Gnocchi was great, lots of Parmesan cheese goes into the sauce. I did not get to try the meatball dish but after seeing them and hearing how they are made I can not wait to come back to try them. We are planning to come back on a Wednesday to try all the tapas, and also happy hour.

I really wanted to love this place. I've heard great things about Fuego Bistro and always wanted to try both restaurants. This was the biggest disappointment I have had at a restaurant in a long time. The service was horrible. The hostess was more interested in chatting with the bartender than seating us. Once the hostess finally acknowledged us and came to seat us she informed us that they were closing in 30 minutes and we needed to order right away. This was at 8:20pm on a Saturday night! She turned away another party later at 8:50pm by saying the kitchen was closed for the evening. As of writing this the website still says they are open til 10pm. If I were the owner or manager I would have fired this hostess/waitress on the spot.   As this was our first time here we wanted to try several different tacos. We ordered short rib, carne asada, and shrimp tacos. The shrimp used were small tasteless. The short rib tacos were awkwardly sweet. I'm not sure they always taste like that or if it was just a bad batch. I would definitely not order them again. The carne asada was good. The rice was obviously the last of the pot. It was dry and crusty like it had been stuck on the bottom of the pot all day. I would have been even more disappointed if I had paid full price. We used a restaurant.com certificate. Regardless, it was not worth the visit.

Another top notch Fox restaurant. They do have the formula down. I cant say this place is anything really incredible or unique. But what it does it does very well. Its affordable. Its very trendy. The quality seems to be top notch. Service was excellent. Our dessert came out approximately 5 minutes after we ordered. It was delivered to us by the manager with apologies that it took so long and it was on the house. We had the warm peanut butter cup. I'm not a huge dessert person, especially chocolate ones, but it was good. The cookie on the side really deserves to be broken up and tossed in the bowl with the gelato. Getting back to the beginning of the meal, we had an appetizer of bacon potato fritters. They are amazingly light and airy. The taste of bacon was only slight. Everything is better with bacon right? The entrees were order were the ricotta dumpling bolognese and the meatloaf special. The dumpling were great. Again light and airy, almost slightly dry. A tad more moist and they could be gnocchi. The bolognese sauce were fairly oily. Most likely from the fat rendered from the cooking of the ground beef. I do think of myself as a meatloaf expert. I'm not easy to please. It was made perfectly. A perfect sweet glaze on top and a moist tender center. Nothing cutting edge with this. Just the basic meatloaf but done well. The mashed potatoes were a let down. I prefer my mashed potatoes on the rustic side. These were obviously whipped in some type of food processor. They get a slightly gluey texture when processed. We had a bottle of Stronghold Nachise with dinner. A great pairing for what we had. I was impressed they dont gouge you on wine prices. Their markup seems to be a more reasonable 100%. I've seen many places triple and quadruple the retail price of a wine. So kudos on that. I would def go back, but not right away. There are so many other places to try yet.

I really wanted to love this place. I had initially seen this place on groupon then read reviews and the menu and was excited to try it. Its a type of atmosphere I like in a restaurant, very modern, and nicely appointed. This ended up being one of the worst dining experiences I have had in a long time. I'm generally pretty easy to please and very forgiving of little issues of a restaurant. This place missed on just about every aspect.  We went at about 4:30 for a late lunch and happy hour. We sat in the lounge and greeted fairly promptly. Drink orders were taken. A little stingy on the pours of their wine. The Sangria, both red and white were tasty. The red Sangria had quite the kick. That was the best part of the evening. After asking for one more minute to browse the menu before ordering our server vanished. It was nearly 20 minutes before having to step up to the bar to ask to order food. We ordered a mix of items as I love to try lots of items from a new place. We ordered the burger, 2 different tacos, crab croquettes, and the meatballs. Most of which are small plate items. The tacos are very small and do not come on a white corn tortilla. I'm not quite sure what it was. I was not a fan. I hardly noticed that their was shrimp in the one taco. I only noticed from looking, it was not from tasting it. The skirt steak in the second taco was tender and flavorful. The crab croquettes and typical of bar food. You could taste the crab, not in a sweet Maryland style crab cake kind of way. It was more like a tuna fish casserole sort of taste. The burger was decent, but definitely not worthy of a $12 price tag. I have had larger Wagyu beef hamburgers for the same price that tasted so much better. The fries with the burger are good and the house made ketchup is great. The last item of what we ordered was the meatballs. Its a cute presentation with triangles of toast for dipping in the bland sauce. Unfortunately the meatballs were uncooked in the center. Not just undercooked and pink, they were RAW on the inside. I sent the dish back of course. The waitress was very apologetic and took them off the bill. As she was trying to clear the table she dropped some silverware and food at our feet. By this time she obviously was not having a good day. She brought us a complimentary dessert of a pumpkin cupcake with ice cream. The ice cream was great. The cupcake was overcooked and dry. When the bill arrived I gave my groupon and credit card to the server. The manager came back with both and apologized for bad experience and comped the whole bill. I'm not sure if I would try them again. The problems with the meal were very basic things that just should never happen at a restaurant of this level.

We went for breakfast last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. The owner, Jackie I think, came out and greeted us and explained a little about the restaurant and food. Very personal service. I was so impressed. The food was excellent. The baked pancakes with blueberry were very tasty and worth trying. The stuffed french toast was top notch also. The restaurant is one of those tiny little local places I love to go to. Prices are very reasonable also. I will definitely be back.
