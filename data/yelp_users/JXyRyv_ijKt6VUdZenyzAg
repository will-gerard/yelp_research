I really want to LOVE My Florist. But it's like one of the really cute boys who you hope and pray will be Mr. Right ... then he opens his mouth.  My Florist is cool. Cool vibe. Cool decor. Cool patrons. Cool piano player.   But really poor food, really poor menu selections and drinks that are way overpriced.  Please, cute boy, go to college and become well-rounded. I really want to love you.

Setting:  Anyone will tell you that it's a little bit shady neighborhood. When I went last time, there was someone outside selling ... umm ... fresh herbs and we were a little worried about leaving our bikes. But otherwise, it is a very homely place inside.   But the food is amazing. Two times I've been here, and two times it was excellent!  YUMMY!!!  Yes it's a bit odd combination, but the waffles somehow complement the chicken well.  You will definitely be full.  Very decent prices.  Highly recommended! It's got that family owned feeling to it.  Thumbs up for the crew!

Seriously?  You made us spend $120 on wine while we were waiting for pizza?  Seriously?  And we were stupid enough to spend $120 on wine while we waited three hours for pizza?  Seriously?  And the pizza was average at best. Even in my drunken, munchie-induced state (wink wink), the pizza didn't live up to the hype or make up for the three hours of life I'll never get back. Let alone the $120 I could have spent on 12 bottles on wine at Costco and been happier.  Seriously?

I have only lived in Phoenix for three months and my first priority was finding a coffee shop to embrace and make my own.  Lux is my own. I love the feeling I get when I walk into the place. The coffee is the best I've ever had. The service is perfect. It is a wonderful place to spend a lazy weekend day and I have met more new friends at Lux than I have anywhere else since I moved to Phoenix.  My only complaint is that it's not closer to my home. Fair Trade, Conspire and Lola are all walking distance from my place, but Lux is more that worth the drive.

OK, every time I got to Matt's, I tell myself that is the last time I will got there. I hate the long wait. And I hate the feeling of being rushed through my weekend breakfast because they are more interested in turning over tables than me having a good dining experience.  But the food keeps me coming back. It is consistently good. They always prepare my food exactly how I request it. And I never leave a crumb to waste, which isn't usually the case.  Sa, as much as I hate to say it, Matt's is worth the wait. And I'll be back.

One of my favorite restaurants in my 'hood.  Hands down the best Thai food in the PHX. I recommend the drunken noodles. Just the right amount of spice to make it interesting and tasty without making it unbearable in the morning.  Pretty easy on the purse, too.

I really love this place. /what separates this place from other yoga studios is its variety of classes that all have consistently solid instructors.  I especially recommend the urban core and candlelight flow classes. I love them both.

I was really sad when Fate closed, so I was delighted when I learned that the guy who started Fate was opening a new place. By now, I've been to Sens a half dozen times and love it more every time I go. I love the energy. I love the location. I love the music. But most of all, I love the food and I love the fact that when I go there I get to sample so many different dishes because they're served tapas style. If you go, here are my three favorites: 1. Volcano flamed. 2. Wasabi soy chicken. 3. Papaya mango salad with crispy tofu. Outrageous!! Check it out and be prepared to get your drink on because they have a great saki menu.

This is tough because I really want this place to succeed, but ...  I've been there twice now. Both times, the service was terrible. The first time, the food (I ordered pasta, but its was so bland and so poorly cooked that it could have been anything) was inedible. The second time, I was able to finish about a third of my diner, but had no interest in taking the rest. I'd had enough.  I was with a friend and her food was no better. I really like everything that True Food wants to be ... but it's like the kid that wants to be president.  We can't all be the president.  Maybe True Food should just try to make GOOD food.

Sefishly, my favorite thing about this place is that it's right in my hood, but I might still make the trip even if it wasn't oh-so-convenient.  I think the interior is well done. High ceilings accented with cool art pieces?  I likey.  The place is small, but it all works. For dinner, their rolls with a mixed drink are on the pricey side.  I LOVE their spicy tuna roll -- I know, what's so special about a spicy tuna roll?  It is pretty spicy, but it burns so good.  Check it out. Have a drink. Then walk home. My perfect place. Winner winner.

I firmly believe in supporting local businesses over impersonal chains, but Lola is trying really hard to prove me wrong.  I live in the Roosevelt neighborhood and love having a cute local place to go to, but I have been regularly let down by Lola.  So let's start with five stars and I will show you how I came up with my rating.  I'll say the best things about Lola first: The coffee is good. No better than Lux, Conspire. Fair Trade or even Starbucks, but solid. The beans are roasted in store and the difference is obvious. So, the COFFEE is OK. They offer free wi-fi. Great! And the building and d√©cor are fantastic. Perfect! Five stars.  But the first time I went there, I didn't get coffee. I ordered a latte and a croissant. I grabbed my drink and ran to catch the light rail. Took a sip. Lukewarm latte. How hard is it to heat up milk sufficiently? On top of that, the croissant was stale and dry. So if you go there, make sure you taste your drink before you leave the place and also take a bite of your pastry. I got coffee the second time I visited and it was fine. But take away one star for that bad first experience. We're now at four stars.  Now the service. Simply put, the people who work there kind of suck. This is a real shame, because they seem like pretty interesting and fun people when they're talking to each other (as they ignore you while you wait impatiently to order). They just seem to be there to hang out and have a good time. I felt like I was in high school again, trying to get the popular kids to notice me (or in this case, get the people who work at Lola to pretend to care about the other side of the counter for a moment). I should knock off two stars because service needs an overhaul, but I'll leave them at three stars.  There are two other knocks I have for Lola. First, they close at 7 p.m., so that eliminates them as a place to hang out after work. They lose a half a star for that. But even if they were open later, I probably would not hang out there because if you don't snag one of the too few comfortable chairs, you're stuck with the most tortuous metal chairs I can imagine. They lose another half a star for that. So we're at two stars.  I would have given Lola a one-star review if I wasn't really hoping they would turn things around. There is nothing I want more than to have a hip, happy, consistent coffee shop in my neighborhood.  But right now, Lola isn't it.
