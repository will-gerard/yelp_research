Dr. Wirth is simply the best. Even if he has no openings, he will squeeze you in if need be. Friendly, caring dentist and staff that will work with you with regard to payment.

We went for lunch. The appetizer was fantastic, but it rapidly went down from there. I had a turkey sandwich and I swear the bread was contractor grade. I mean seriously, if I were building a new house this stuff could be used to construct the foundation. I mentioned it to the waiter 3 (!!!) times and he still didn't offer anything to fix it. I finally had to say "Hey, can't you do anything about this?" His "manager" comp'd me a slice of cheesecake, whoop-dee-doo. The tab was over $100 for myself, wife, and our three kids. That free slice of cheesecake sure helped! Bottom line is, we will NOT be going back even if it's free!

My care experience overall was good, however because of my experience with their billing I cannot rate them any higher than 2 stars. This facility bills as a "General Acute Care Hospital" (NPI 1700910189) which most insurance providers process as an Emergency Room visit. It just so happened that I needed to be transferred to the ER, at a CHW hospital, so I was billed for TWO ER copays! Neither my insurance company or CHW Patient Financial Services wants to do anything about this.

A great cut at a great price! I am always a little leary of trying out a new barber (I am fairly new to the razor cut), but rest assured this place is professional and it's one of the best cuts I've had.

Skimpy tacos and only OK salsa, combined with the fact that an employee used the bathroom and resumed behind the counter without a hand-washing, made this the worst America's experience I have ever had. The only redeeming quality were the chips, until we got to the bottom of the basket and found a hair!
