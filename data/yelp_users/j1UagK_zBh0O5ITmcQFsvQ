I had my hair butchered by a stylist here in surprise; she was new, that's all I'm going to say.  Well, that and, I hope she gets better.  Anyhow, after the cut here in surprise, I was referred to a stylist at Salon Boulevard by my friend.  I honestly cannot thank my friend and my new stylist Eve enough.  I thought I would have to get all my hair chopped off to fix the bad cut.  Eve saved me about 5 inches of hair.

This has to be the most impressive WalGreens store around the west valley.  It's huge and has a great selection of products.  What really stood out is their section that simulates a Circle K or Quik-Trip.  Want an ICEE?  Yup, they have an Icee machine. I even considered buying one of their gourment-type sandwiches/wraps/salad/dessert.  It's a 24 store and has a very well lit cosmetics area.  I can't wait to go back!

Nice little hole in the wall with simple & fresh Mexican food.  There's a full bar and happy hour from 4-7 everyday!  I'll admit, the shopping center this place is in may put you off... don't be scared.  The restaurant is a bit dated... continue not being scared.  Total comfort food awaits for those not easily deterred.

Let's test the authenticity... So the restaurant and bar area were packed.  They offer seating in either the dinning room or the patio, and it took about 45 minutes to get seated.  The Margaritas were great... the food was respectable, not authentic.  The nachos" tortillas cut in half, cheese melted to the tortilla (think cheese crisp) and a hunk of shredded meat neatly placed on each "Nacho".  Don't get me wrong, they tasted great, and they come with pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and shredded lettuce.  We also had steak fajitas, ordered the 2 person portion.  It was enough and then some.  They were good... not mind blowing, but very good.  All In All, it was a pleasant experience... the staff is very friendly and attentive, even on such a busy night.

They serve very fresh sandwiches and they have a different flavor all their own.  Yes it may just be a sandwhich, but this location has very freindly staff & great chocolate chip cookies.

Major points scored by what-a-burger for treating evey customer that walks in the door like a welcomed guest!  The staff are friendly and attentive!  I am a fan of the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger because it's just the right size for me.

I had the craving for some menudo & i was very happy to have stumbled into this place and found they have menudo blanco, which is menudo without the chili already added.  It was great and i'll be back soon!

I'm a fan of Buffalo Wild Wings; but my last trip left more to be desired.  Most visits have been generally great experiences, unfortunately my non-meateating friend was served a 100% beef patty, not the blackbean burger he ordered.  My Spinach-Artichoke Chicken Flatbread was delicious.  They have delicious options aside from their wings.

I had a chicken & pesto sandwich that was absolutely delicious.  It had rosated red peppers and sauteed mushrooms.  It was truly satisfying for lunch.  It was hard to decide on what to have as the menu has a lot to choose from.  It does get very busy at lunch-time during the week, seating can be a challenge.  The staff is very friendly and polite.  Noise level is in the mid to high range but nothiing annoying.  I recommend giiving it a try if you are in the mood for a soup or salad offers more than standard ingredients.

I usually avoid this ross, especially on weekends... but a situation came up and we ended up at ross... Not a very good selection, usually poorly organized and under stocked on women's clothes & shoes.  NICE EMPLOYEES THOUGH!

I was told the regulars don't take to kindly to newcomers, and it was kind of obvious with the looks we were getting.  I really wish I could give it a higher star rating, but honestly, I don't think the regulars would welcome that.  It's one of those places they want to keep for themselves.  I'll Respect That.  My friends that have been to this bar more that once, despite the unwelcoming regulars, admit to riff raff hanging out there that are not regulars. Fights happen often.  On my first, and more than likely last visit, I saw a guy vomit on the floor near the pool tables. A "working girl" approached me at the bar (scary).  They did have horseshoes and tables out back & Karaoke on the back patio.  It could be a nice place, if only the atmosphere was more welcoming.

I'm sold & ready to go back.  I walk in as part of a party of four and was able to sample a few different items.  Truly, it was all beyond satisfying.  I tried the cheese ravioli, bruschetta, chicken pesto lasagna & of course i forgot the name of the last dish; it was a pizza with prosciutto.  There were a few hiccups with the dining experience.  Nothing too terrible, just take it into account before you show up.  Not everything on the menu is always available.  Yes, they ran out of a few items, must have been our fault for getting there toward the end of their hours.  So we didn't get to try the baked spaghetti, but the cheese ravioli was AH-MAZING!  Also, the only dessert they had was cheesecake.  I have nothing, NOTHING, against cheese cake, but I really wanted to try the cannoli & another at my table asked about the tiramisu.  That was when we found out we came when the pastry chef was on vacation.  Maybe next time.  + They serve some beer & wine, not a full bar though, so selection is limited. ++ They also serve Mexican coke (different flavor from American coke). - Only had lemon Italian soda that day, & they are small bottles but the same price as the 1ltr coke.   Let me also say this: They are usually busy, so a line out of the door to get in is probably common.  This does make it a bit difficult to flag someone down when you need something.  Good things all around and I do recommend you try it.  During the winter there is a beautiful view of Glendale Glitters across the street.   (BTW, They have a semi-enclosed outdoor dining area. "Al Fresco" anyone?)

I can admit I was a little skeptical of what my dining experience here would be like considering all the reviews.  I must have been fortunate that day because everything went well and the food was good.  The servers and the chef were polite and attentive.  The Chef was very entertaining, and even though he missed every attempt at chucking food in out mouths, it was still a fun time.  In my tip I mentioned they do not have Happy Hour.  They do have a well stocked bar and bar area, so I was very surprised that they do not have a happy hour special.  I would have spent more money on drinks had they a drink special.  The dinning is equally comparable to Benihana's and Ah-So.  Prices and gimmik are all the same.  I was in a group of 7 dining and most of the orders all came out together.  I tried both the teppan and sushi, nothing to write home about, but decent.  I left full and satisfied.  I may go back in the future for dinner, but I can think of more places nearby that offer happy hour, so i'll just go somewhere else for drinks and appetizers.

Always busy when it's lunch or dinner time!  It's worth it for their delicious burgers.  It's always the same at In-N-Out, juicy patties, fresh veggies and full fat cheese.  I usually order the Grilled Cheese, since you get all the juicy meat flavor without the meat.  Otherwise it's a double-double animal style with No Pickles and 2 sides of spread.

Tucked way-way in a corner of a less-than-impressive strip mall, there lives this lovely little gem.  I ordered the pho beef combo & it really hit the spot.  I had a favorite vietnamese restaurant back home, and nothing will ever be as good.  Although this restaurant did come very close.  The owner was nice and served me a delicious iced tea while i was waiting for my to-go order to be finished.  I really couldn't tell you what it was made of, but I like that instead of just water, they serve you tea.  It's those small considerations that make me want to go back.  It's quite a ways away, but I'm willing to make the effort!

It's like any other chili's. not the best service; not the worst.  It's a chain so i don't think they really care about training people to be spot-on.

I can't wait to go back and try their sushi.    I did enjoy the dish I ordered (see pictures) and it was my first attempt of korean food outside of BBQ.  The Kimchee was spicy but I still want more.  The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  I let her know it was my first time trying real korean food and helped me figure out what i would like best and tips on how to set up my plate.  So I had a beer, some soup, some dinner and watched football.  Too bad I was too full to order dessert.

Such a beautiful campus.  The art in the museum was of an assorted variety.  There was pretty, thought provoking, and fun art of all mediums on display.    It was a very entertaining night and I had a lot of fun with the visual feast Yelp and the musem provided. The building itself reminded me of the movie 'The Labyrinth'.  I was holding my breath waiting for David Bowie to pop out as I made my way throughout the building.

This is decent Thai food... I really went with the intent to get a Thai Tea.  Mission Accomplished on that front.  But the food is good, not the best or the worst.  They do serve large portions for the price.  There were only a few tables occupied when I had lunch there, and they all seemed please.

Service could have been a little quicker, but the servers were very friendly.  They convinced me to become a fan of whiskey by serving me a Terrific Mint Julep.  Within a group we tried the prime rib & tuna carpaccio; All Delicious!  There was a hiccup with the first order of prime rib bits, but they were nice about getting a new batch served up.   The decor reminded me of those swanky bars of old.  Hand-tooled leather booths and chairs with chandeliers, candlelight, dark wood surfaces and a full bar.  They offer drinks made with absinthe and mescal.  It's comparable to a local bar back home in Fullerton, Ca. (The Continental) that is rumored to have been a speakeasy back in the day. If you're looking for a dark and clean bar that serves dinner, this is the place.

So this is now called the Beverly? Uh sure!  It was better on service and the kitchen was open late.  Seems that the menu has changed, which I enjoyed.   Even though they no longer had mint julep on the menu, it's nice that they changed it up and offered something different than before.  The interior is still swanky and TDF.

Of the two stores in suprise, this one is the best.  Polite and helpful employees, much better organized and stocked products.   The parking here is great, as they do not share a lot in a busy shopping center andthe store is less busy.

I prefer this location over the one in the Arrowhead area.  I like that it's usually less busy than the Arrowhead location, it's usually more organized and tidy. Parking is usually not a problem either.  They also have unique or quirky gifts.  I can usually find something for anyone I need to find a gift for... Especially Myself!

Other circle K's are much cleaner than this one.  The best thing about this store is the Employees are friendly and nice.  I've been to this location in the morning and in the evening and there must be a point where the shift changes and they stop cleaning the bathrooms and emptying the trash.  In the morning everything is clean, by the time evening rolls around there are odd smells all over the store. It's a shame since it is a larger, newer looking store that it isn't cleaner.  I'll be back in hopes they clean up a little more.

I do enjoy this restaurant, but let me be honest; I wouldn't say it's very authentic.  It does have great flavors and the staff is very nice.  I have been greeted by the owner on every visit and I appreciate how attentive he is.  I enojy going in for a cocktail and their pho good.  The regular size isn't as large as other places but it will leave you full.  It's fancy for veitnamese food.

Agave Blue gets 5 stars for having great tasting yogurt in creative flavors.  They also have a large assortment of trim and fixin's.  I tried their maple bacon yogurt and it was onbe of the best things I have ever put in my mouth.  If the pangs of trying to be a responsible adult weren't so strong, I would have had a cup filled to the brim for lunch instead of a half cup.  They also invested a lot in the interior & decor.  Muy Chic!

I really want to like this place because it's so close & I can see the potential of this being a great sports bar. THE GOOD: I went for happy hour & you definitely get a lot of food for the $.  THE BAD: The servers need a bit more experience. THE UGLY: The overall decor is flat out lacking. Maybe they aren't done... please say it's not done.

This Carl's Jr just opened on April 17.  I was one of the first to visit when it opened and found joy that they arr currently overstaffed.    On a second visit I dined in and was asked by more than one employee if I needed anything and if everything was satisfactory.  It was the greatest fast food service I have had in a long time.

If you want a specialty brat, come here!  They have Rabbit, rattlesnake, and regular brats too!  The staff is welcoming, friendly and passionate about what they serve.  That passion translated into the delicious food the served.  The roasted pork was absolutely amazing.  I didn't try the chicken and waffles since my plate was full and I didn't want to take food I wouldn't  be able finish.  I left stuffed full of great food.    The date-cake was mind blowing.  I am not the biggest fan of dates, but this cake completely caught me off guard.  They have a very nice outdoor seating area, there was a fire going and a giant sized Jenga. They also have cornhole outside. A great place to go if you want to get out.

LOVE THE DONUTS THEY SERVE HERE. Having said that... I'm not happy with their prices and this might be unfair, but honestly, it's a simple donut.  I can't believe I paid almost a dollar for an average sized donut.  It's a great tasting donut, but come on!  I would have been just as happy with 2 donuts from Basha's or Fry's for that price.  I tried a boba smoothie.  Strawberry Mango: the boba was great, not one overcooker/ hard boba ball, but the smoothie was more mango than I expected. Mango overpowered the strawberry, it wasn't even a fair fight... Mango smoked Strawberry hands down.  Next time, I'll order a single flavor smoothie, instead of trying to get fancy-smanschie combo flavors.

This was my first visit, and my nails look awesome.    The owner was very nice, very attentive and asked a lot of questions about how I like my nails and what I liked about my other nail salon.  I've never had a consultation on my nail preference and I really appreciated that he wanted to give me the nails I wanted.    I will admit it smelled kinda funny in there... like food, but I'm not there to eat I'm there to get my nails done.  It was close to dinner time, he might have had something to eat.    They also have their sanitizing machine out where you can see them being used.  I have an issue when salons don't show that they sanitize or have sanitary equipment.  They also are less expensive than most other shops... I had my old set removed and a new set added (with uv gel over) for $33.00.    This is not a new Locaation for a nail shop; there had been another shop there before.  I was told this is new ownership.
