Worst experience I could of imagined.... First the call to the ER. The lady was so rude and refused to let me speak to someone else. Like her pride was beyond my son health.... Then when I got here I thought I was in the hunger games fighting for my life how I begged/yelled at the girl to at lest sign us in while a drugged up junky was ranting and raving... No surprise all eyes on the one well enough to piss us all off is getting all the attention while the room is packed with sick people.. Well I get the attention of a worker that isn't doing anything so I ask if I could get signed in she points to the clerk (very interested in what is going on with dumb ass) and tells me she cant, only she can...  I finally got signed in.... Since I know I'm in for a long wait I thought I might as well jump on yelp! Never go here!! 911 can send u a medic just tell the operator u don't know if it is an emergence but your scared.  It made me put a star.. I didn't want to!

Bowling prices are fine but food is not good. Games are over priced and half of them don't work. The staff is not friendly the guy at the snack counter got upset with me because I ordered something right before he was going to clock out... Sooorrry...

So far I really like this school! Very homey, the staff are so welcoming and helpful! I am a single Mom with a full time job so the blended scheduled and night classes work out perfectly!

I have been going here for a while now and my opinion has changed quite a bit. I love the scheduling and the small class size, but that is about it. They cost way to much for what you get. Teachers are not that great, no employer I have met so far knows of this school, and the financial aid department is a joke..

Yep its a bar but you would not know it when you taste the food! Order the turkey bacon club (with bbq sauce on the side) when it's the special. Its amazing and I want it on the menu!!

Can't really get better then a family owned deli! The food there is great! I use to go there all the time when our office was close and now that we moved I miss it every day. Try the Godfather, it is so good!

Very cute mom and pop dog supply/wash. They have tubs for $12 where u can wash your own dog and they will provide everything u need. Or you can pay a little more for them to do it for you. My dog is about 15 lbs and they charged me $28. It took about an hour and 15 minutes. I was able to go run some errands and come back to a clean, good smelling, happy puppy :).   Front desk staff is very young and not that welcoming but you get over that because the owner is great! We will be back.
