Went through the drive through at 9 pm on my way home. Ordered a Whopper with lettuce, tomato, and ketchup.  Got home, opened my food, and found i'd been given a Whopper with mayo, pickle, onion, and lettuce. After eating 3/4 of the burger, discovered long black hair in my burger. Will not be returning to this location.

Place was pretty dead, only 2 other parties of people. Excellent service, but aside from the appetizer of spring rolls(which were delicious), food was very mediocre. The pad thai was a big pile of barely spicy noodles, chicken and shrimp- no bean sprouts or vegetables. Hubby got a basil chicken dish which he said was ok, but left him still hungry. Neither of our dishes came with rice. We just weren't impressed with the food, but our go-to Thai place, Siam Thai, is run by a family from thailand, so we are a bit spoiled.

We had the broccoli beef, chicken fried rice, and orange chicken. The broccoli beef was great, crisp veggies and tender beef in a not too salty sauce. Chicken fried rice was awesome, chunks of tender chicken with crisp bean sprouts and some veggies. Hubby was not a fan of the orange chicken because the breading was the soft style, but it tasted really good. Delivery was fast, and food was fairly priced. Looking forward to trying out more dished!

Lived here for 2 years. Everything was ok for the most part, until we were getting ready to move out. The water heater in the apartment above us broke, and was leaking water into our laundry room. It took them 3 weeks to getting around to fix it- by that time, the damage was so bad they had to pull out almost all the drywall, and the studs inside had molded.  Then, we had the carpet cleaned (900 sq ft apartment), and were told it wasn't good enough, so we had the company we used come back and do it again. Management still wasn't satisfied, and we were told that they would have the carpets cleaned and it would come out of our deposit. We were also told we would be charged a small cleaning fee, which would also come out of our $300 deposit. We said fine, dropped off the keys, made sure they had BOTH sets of forwarding addresses, and left- this was august 28th, 2013.   Today, Nov. 14, 2013, I got a call from a bill collector stating that Rancho viejo had turned over a bill for $94 in cleaning fees. NO ATTEMPT was ever made by rancho viejo to contact myself, my husband, or our roommate about this. RV had 3 phone numbers, 3 email addresses, and 2 physical addresses, but made no attempt to contact us about the problem. Worst apartment complex ever.  Bottom line: be very careful and document everything when you move out, or they will try to screw you over.

Our go-to place for chinese. Don't be fooled by it's outside appearance- everything is always fresh and delicious. Our favorite is the Kung Pow 2, which is shrimp, chicken, and lots of different veggies in a spicy sauce. We also love the house fried rice, which is your normal fried rice with veggies, bean sprouts, etc but also comes with pork chicken, and shrimp. Very generous portions, also. We always have at least enough left over for lunch or dinner the next day, as the large sized items are 32 oz.

Never again will we go here. We are fairly sure we got FOOD POISONING from eating here. A friend of ours insisted we had to go for the fish and chips: place was pretty empty when we arrived, and we were told to seat ourselves. The appetizers were pretty good- pizza mozzarella sticks.   I don't like fried fish, so I had a chicken sandwich, which had mayo. My husband had the fried fish, as well as coleslaw(made with mayo), which no one else in our party ate. 2-4 hours later, we both started feeling quite ill- agonizingly painful stomach cramps, nausea, and several other symptoms I won't go into here. The symptoms lasted for 4 days. Bottom line, avoid anything with mayo.  We certainly will not return.

My hubby and I love this place. We drive down from north phoenix (Dunlap & I-17) for their sushi. We just cannot find a place in PHX that has sushi as good as Saketini. Sushi is always fresh, waitresses are always attentive, and we have NEVER had an extra gratuity added to our bill- and we went there for Valentine's. We recommend the Signature roll. Happy hour and reverse happy hour are great too.

We were extremely impressed with both the price and the quality offered here. The salmon and spicy tuna rolls were superb. Eel roll was good, the salmon skin rolls were amazing. The Rock & Roll was good, but pretty overpriced as you only get 5 pieces for $10.50  Excellent service, nice decor, and a lovely place to go for lunch or dinner.

I see Lori Lynn for all my hair needs- and with my hair being 3 feet long, I have a LOT of needs! She's incredibly sweet and easy to talk to, and makes the 3 hours I spend in her chair fly by. She also mixes up the most beautiful, natural red color for me, which I and my husband love. The only person I trust with my hair. Go see her, you won't regret it!

My husband and I had the joy of getting married here Nov. 3rd 2013, and it was amazing. Joe and his crew are all incredible, and will work with you to help make your day perfect. Every request we had they worked with us on. I brought in several feather arrangements, bows, origami stars and hearts, and everything was arranged as I asked. Communication was wonderful- They called every month to check how everything was going, which was key since we live about an hour away from the venue. Emails were always returned within 24 hours. The food is flat out amazing, I'm still getting comments about it. Pro tip- get the prime rib. You won't be sorry. The pricing is also incredible, and they will gladly make suggestions to fit within your budget. My recommendation is to go with the packages they offer, as they save you quite a bit of money. Just overall a very professional and caring team. I would book here again in a heartbeat.  Side note- while the wedding stuff is great, it IS an older hotel with tube tvs, and the hotel area is kind of run down, but they are in the middle of refurbishing the rooms.

Freshly made tortillas, delicious ingredients, cheap prices, and a salsa bar make this our go-too mexican place. The Surf & Turf burrito is amazing- shrimp, steak, veggies, rice and a creamy chipotle sauce.

Popped into the fabulous San Tan valley location today, & was definitely made to feel like a rock star! Each & every associate spoke to me at least once, asking if I needed help finding anything or had any questions. They all seemed to genuinely love their jobs, & were happy to be there. One of the lovely ladies had just the most fabulous cat eye liner (she said her secret was Stila), the amazing manager, Mary Kelly, was rocking a fierce red lip, the awesome employee who helped me find a good concealer brush (& explained how to use the darn thing) had absolutely flawless foundation, & the gentleman who checked me out had some amazing ink.  Mary was really on top of everything, she helped at least 3-4 people the first 5 minutes I was there, helped me figure out what was up with my mystery concealer I couldn't find, gave me some tips on working with a new concealer I had purchased at a different store,then had an associate meet me in the brush section to discuss the pros and cons of various concealer brushes. Great place to go for makeup!!!

Hands down the best Thai food in phoenix. Hubby says it's the best Thai food he's had since coming back from Thailand. Amazing service, quality food, and good prices. We go here a MINIMUM of once a month, usually twice- and we only go out to eat on saturdays. The Pad Thai is to die for, and their fried bananas and coconut icecream is amazing.

Emailed them this morning about their services- We just bought a house and wanted to get the ductwork & ac checked out. Got a call 2 hours later directing me to another company that can do everything I need.  I just wanted to share how impressed I was that not only did they respond promptly, but they directed me to another company instead of just say "sorry, can't help you." Very good business!

Absolutely fantastic shop. Well educated, helpful, friendly staff that greets you when you enter, a well spoken, experienced and knowledgeable manager, delicious coffee (ask for the special if you love chocolate) free wi-fi, a gaming room with flatscreens, and a welcoming, relaxing atmosphere make this shop INFINITELY superior to Atomic Comics.  Add "bad movie nights" and an open mike night, and you have a winning combination!  I would recommend this store to anyone, and look forward to returning soon.

Hubby and I decided we wanted pizza today, so I called our usual place, Raffaele's Pizza. They were closed, but we still wanted pizza. We went out on a limb and ordered from Ol Pizzeria, which had left a menu on our door, and we are delighted with the result.  We ordered 2 xl pizzas & garlic bread. When we arrived to pick it up, Johnny, the owner, urged us to try a slice, and told us he would appreciate a review here on yelp, whether good or bad. He was also in the middle of making his OWN pizza dough!   Even though the pizza had been sitting for 10-20 minutes because we got lost, it was still pretty crisp, and absolutely delicious. Flavorful, rich sauce, not overly sweet like most places are, crisp chewy brick oven crust, just the right amount of stretchy, fresh mozzarella, and tasty sausage made this unlike any other pizza I've ever had. Quite honestly, it blows Raffaele's pizza (and every chain pizza ever) straight out of the water.  I am so glad Raffaele's was closed today, or we never would have discovered the Gem that is the Ol Pizzeria! This is now our Go-To pizza place, and we will be ordering often, and telling our friends about it as well.  Thank you Ol Pizzeria & Cafe for a delicious experience!

Sadly, the Ol Pizzeria has been taken over by a chain- Giant Manhattan Pizza and Wings. Worse, the new management has, quite literally, the worst pizza I have ever tasted. Cardboard cheese, canned sauce, and all so greasy that there were puddles of oil on the pizza, and the crust was incredibly floppy- not a good thing when it's thin crust. Furthermore, we were not informed when we placed our order that the Pizzeria had been bought out- In fact, they flat out lied. I specifically asked on the phone if this was the Pizzaria, as I did not recognise the voice of the person who answered. We were horrified to arrive and find that they'd been bought out, and the prices kept despite the much smaller size of the pizza. We will not be ordering from here ever again.

Joshua is who we always see here. Fantastic customer service- we come here for lunch once a week and he knows our orders and greets us by name. As for the food, it's amazing- the lunch special s are an amazing value. $6 for a huge 2 topping slice and a drink. Savory sauce, melty cheese, and a crisp crust make this our go-to pizza place in Mesa.

Jim is amazing. He spent 30 minutes speaking with my husband about his glasses and his options for getting prescription sunglasses (limited, as my husband has an extremely unusual eyeglass prescription) and showed us many frames to choose from. Later, he spent a good 20 minutes adjusting my husband's frames so they fit him perfectly! Jim is not actually in-network with our eye insurance, but he has our business for life. You just don't find customer service like this anymore!

I cannot recommend Healthy Paws enough. In November 2014, our furbaby Khan was diagnosed with pancreatitis caused by an obstruction. He had to have surgery. 3 days later we had to rush him to the ER vet after infected fluid started streaming from his surgery site. He was diagnosed with septic peritonitis and had to have a second surgery, as well as a week long stay in the ER. Healthy Paws was there every step of the way. Each claim (about 10 total) was processed within 1-2 days, and we received the last reimbursement check about a week after Khan was able to come home. All told, the total bill for 2 surgeries and a week long ER stay was just under $15k, and Healthy Paws covered 90% of it- we only ended up paying about $1500. We wouldn't have been able to save our baby without it.  This April, Khan was diagnosed with an eye ulcer that just would not leave. After multiple vet visits, he was finally given a clean bill of health, but the ulcer came back much worse than before. Less than 14 hours after the 2nd ulcer was found, his eye ruptured. Again, we had to rush him to the ER vet at 1 am and pray that they could save his eye. They were able to keep him stable until the eye surgeon was available, and they operated first thing in the morning. The surgery was successful, Khan is currently recuperating nicely, and there is a good chance that he will have at least partial vision in the eye. Again, we couldn't have afforded to save his eye without Healthy Paws- the total bill between the surgery and the ER was approximately $3800, and our portion, after reimbursement, was only $500. We got the first check for the $3000 surgery within a week. Khan will never be insured with anyone else!

Hands down the BEST chinese food I've ever had, along with excellent service.  We started with the calamari, and were just blown away. These are not the sad little rings you see most places, oh no, these little beauties are 3-4 inches long, as thick as your thumb- and are cooked to perfection. No rubberiness here!  Hubby got thai basil chicken. Beautifully flavored in a rich, spicy sauce, with chicken so mouthwateringly tender it could be cut with a spoon. I got the tres amigos, which is served fajita style on a cast iron skillet. Same mouthwateringly succulent chicken, but with equally tender shrimp and beef tossed with snowpeas, baby corn, carrots, and a few other veggies in a rich brown sauce. While we were eating, the owner's wife came over and asked how we were liking everything, and asked if we'd like to try a sample of general yang's chicken. Of course we said yes! A few minutes later, we experenced the culinary masterpiece that is yang's. Same super tender chicken with extremely light breading- just enough that you get a lovely crunch as you bite down, and covered in szechwan sauce. Everything was perfect, and we are going back tonight for more!
