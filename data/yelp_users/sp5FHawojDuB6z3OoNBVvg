Poor service and dirty pretty much sums up this experience. Asked for a water with lemon. No lemon. Lots of staff working here just walking around attempting to avoid the 6 tables in front of them fill with garbage and unfinished plates. The service here needs a facelift.

First timer and the food was very good! I don't normally eat hole in the wall Asian food due to past experiences but I decided to give this place a try with a positive attitude. I don't regret it one bit. I ordered the teriyaki bowl and a small salad. The salad was a great start, and I love the dressing they use. The teriyaki bowl was very fulfilling, I added extra teriyaki sauce. Might have to give more spots like this a try

Great place for lunch! Their pastrami sandwich on sour dough bread is one of the best in town.

Crazy how other people don't enjoy this place, my experience today was great. Awesome food and awesome service. The remodel is looking really good! Great facelift but still the same feeling. Will come back soon.

Food was okay. The service was 6/10. Came in for a birthday party of 15, so I understand it's a bit hectic, but we did make reservations ahead of time so they can make preparations. The biggest issue was we asked for our check to be split at the beginning while ordering and when we asked for the check it was Not split. Good luck to anyone that gives it a try, and don't come in with more than 2 people...

By far one of the best places to get a torta in Arizona. Def recommend trying it out, the staff is friendly and welcoming. There is also always fresh bread

Don't do it. This place is a horrible location. Turned in for so quick gas and I've been waiting in this line to get out of the gas station for 20+ minutes. Avoid this location at all cost.

Always love me a Lenny's burger! Don't forget the bacon!! Only thing keeping you from 5 stars is your soggy bun, not sure what sauce it is that makes it so soggy, but def use less it. The Bacon is awesome!!! Love the fries and the environment is very welcoming. It is a old style burger joint that I will continue to visit.  Highly recommended if you're looking to catch a burger, put down the Big Mac.

If I could give zero stars I def would. This night crew sucks and I've been here for 15 stuck in the drive through. If I could leave I would. Won't be coming back mc Donald's does not know how to customer service.

Great service for the most part, the staff is very friendly and welcoming. Made a quick run for some electronic equipment for work and was in and out in 10 minutes. Can't speak for the rest of the store but the electronics department are doing their part.

Called in my order about 10 minutes ahead of arrival, and they stared my order right away. Got there, paid, and waited about 5-8 minutes for FRESH wings. Drove home and it was still nice and hot. The night staff was friendly and the food was Great! Defiantly will be back.

This restaurant defiantly makes it into my top 10. I have been here around 3-4 total and every time I come in the customer service here blows my mind. Every employee is very attentive on taking care of not only their table but every customer. Not only does our server check up on us regularly, so do other servers walking by.... It is very wonderful! The food is great and I will continue to come back! Thank you for late breakfast!

Great food & great service! 1st timer and an employee noticed I was looking over the menu quite hard and helped me out with the menu. She told me her festivities & I picked one.( the turkey lurkey) sooooo good! With a side of "tots" sweet potatoes and regular tots. Not to mention we picked up some fun trinkets. Def will be back thank you guys!

Service took a little too long but I do admit the food was all very fresh and we went threw the drive threw. Also first time trying their fried zucchini and I do approve. Waffle fries are always a must. Lady working the drive threw was very nice and friendly. If I'm in the area again I will return.

First timer.. The sandwich selection is superb for lunch. I personally had the pastrami and turkey sandwich with coleslaw in it... I'm not much of a coleslaw kind of guy, but that sandwich was defiantly up on the list for greatness. Thank you, we will be back for more!

Great food!! Loved the environment and the surroundings, made me and my party feel very welcomed. My friends are regulars there, so they showed me the ropes. If you come in with a group of friends or even just a date, try the Russian roulette for an appetizer.(highly recommended) I've already recommended a few of my friends here and will defiantly be back!

Being open late makes this place convenient, other then that there aren't many positives. The pizza is okay,!the boneless wings are microwave boneless wings from Walmart, all soggy. Stay away from them.

Great place to eat! The environment is very welcoming and comfortable. $2 tacos & $5 margs at happy hour... Can't beat that. They surprisingly really good tacos for $2. Defiantly recommend the carnitas tacos. The guac is nothing special but the tacos make up for it. Oh yeah... The salas, is GREAT! I'll take a side to-go!

Not really my type of place. Mill let alone is pretty bad during the day, lots of people asking for change.. This little spot was a quick pizza stop. The service is 4 out of 10. About 80% of the time the bartender was in her phone (even while other customers were walking in). Not very welcoming. The wings were Great! Def up there. As for the pizza, it's nothing special, the same flat pizza found everywhere else on mill. Prolly won't be back, you guys should def work on your customer service.

Honestly this place always hits the spot. For some reason I had a doubt about coming here.... 12pt chicken later in a satisfied customer. One thing I really like about this chain is how clean and welcoming they are. Second time at this location and I will be back. Thanks!

Great first time experience. I went light with the chicken Caesar salad, but none the less it it the SPOT! Very fulfilling and super fresh. My friend tried the chicken chipotle panini and he was satisfied as well. Nothing to WOW about it, the food is good though. Kind of like a Paradise Bakery concept.
