So my first experience here was not so hot. The dishes we ordered were pretty bland (all needed a generous amount of soy sauce). The one thing I did enjoy were the pot-stickers and the yummy dipping sauce. I ended up pouring that pure yummyness all over my main entree. To tell you the truth, I was hesitant on trying this place again until I took a peek at some reviews and found people had lots of good things to say about the place.  So i gave it another shot. The atmosphere in this place is like sitting in large asian shoe box, it's one big dining room, yet it's not off-putting. It's strangely welcoming. You feel like your family with everyone else eating there. I went on a Saturday night and I was surprised to see so many old people. I'm all "this place has to be good if the older crowd is here". The  psychedelic plastic lighting fixtures cycling through all the colors of the rainbow makes me laugh but I love it. The service is quick and attentive, however when we tried to order a Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper, the small asian woman had no idea what we were talking about and blurted out something I could not make out. I heard "Coke" in the jumble of words and just said "yes". They work as a team there which makes for some speedy service. We ordered a few appetizers: Pot-Stickers and Crab  Puffs. The Pot Stickers were good but the Crab Puffs were not. The inside lacked any crab at all and had a runny constancy that quite frankly, surprised me. Eww. Avoid these. I remember reading a review from Alexander C. suggesting the Orange Chicken. What a great choice! The dish made up for the runny crab puffs. The meat was top notch; moist with no grizzly chunks like a lot of places have. The sauce was bursting with flavor and had just the right amount of heat to it. I highly recommend this dish.  China Chili...glad I gave it another shot :)

I eat here probably once a week for lunch and I must say, It's one of my top favorite pizza joints. Lunch here is a breeze. There is usually no wait at peek lunch hours and to boot they have an express lunch line that gives you the option to order by the slice from an assortment of pre-made pizzas. Ok. I know I know. Pre-made??? Let me tell you, they heat that shit right up in their oven and its perfect! I usually pig out here and get three slices, either the plain cheese (so simple and so good), the pepperoni/jalapeno or the tomato ricotta white pizza. Oh yeah, the sicilian style pizza is awesome, but that one you have get made fresh to order. Way better that way. You can really taste the NYC water in the dough with that one! If you enjoy a good Greek Salad this place has one of the best. The dressing is so damn good.  I have tried on occasion to stray from the pizza and have always been disappointed. NYPD is excellent for pizza, I suggest sticking with that when you go.

Oh how I miss the days when China Village was good. Don't even bother going here now. The meat is hard to chew threw, the fryer way too hot, and every dish uses the same bland brown sauce. The orange chicken was the dish I always got, but the poor thing as been reduce to a plate of grizzly, overly deep fried, dog meat with some orange sauce on top. Trust me. Don't waste your money here. I'm actually surprised they are still open!

I've been to Buca several times and have never been impressed with the food. The atmosphere is fun but a restaurant needs to have more than a fun atmosphere. The food is less than average. Our most recent visit was for a large group of people and we were put at a booth with a round table  pushed up against it, with the end leaf of the table slanting down, making it very difficult for the two people sitting at the end to eat. (me)  Our waitress was unfriendly and all business. No personality at all. The whole time i felt like we were just an pain in the ass for her.  Now on to the food. We ordered a caesar salad which i could not even eat because the whole thing tasted like fish. I'm ok with a slight anchovy flavor but this was un-eatable. Apparently the dish comes with anchovies standard or on the side. I guess there is no getting around the nasty fish taste, even if you ask for no anchovies at all. The other dishes we ordered were the macaroni rosa, manicotti, and chicken marsala. The macaroni rosa was only slightly warm and lacked flavor. I've had pink sauces before and this was no where close to them. (Maggianos has a great vodka tomato cream sauce) The manicotti was probably the best of the worst but really...how can you mess up manicotti. It's a noodle with ricotta cheese in it. The chicken marsala looked so good with huge mushrooms and a rich sauce. I took one bite and was done. The sauce was so overwhelmingly sweet that i though it was a desert.  The only reason i went was to see some family out of town and the decision was out of my hands. I thought, what the hell, I give it another shot. Buca  Di Beppo. Yet another disappointment.

I love Kona, in particular, I love their macadamia nut chicken. It's always fresh and hot. It's paired with this sweet apricot jam and brown gravy. The combination of savory with a splash of sweet is out of this world. I could eat this dish every week. As for the sushi, it fairly top notch. I usually get the Philadelphia rolls. Yummyness.

I've been going to Maggiano's since it opened and have always found the food authentic and tasty. When i find a dish I like I stick to it and here I found the Rigatoni D a true favorite.  I'm a difficult eater and usually have to create my own dish. (I should open a restaurant) so of course, I had to change the make up of the dish. They have an AMAZING tomato vodka cream sauce, one of the best i've had in Phoenix that is a must try. I order the Rigatoni D with the vodka sauce, no onions. (they are caramelized and don't pair well the the vodka sauce) The mushrooms (full caps), chicken and vodka sauce is truly amazing with the over sized rigatoni noodles. It's a dish a crave once a week. Also try their dinner salad with their italian dressing. Big shavings of fresh parmagian cheese and one of the best italian dressings i've had.  The only reason I wont give Maggiano's 5 stars is because they did something to their eggplant parmagian. It used to be the only other dish i would order because it was so amazing. layers of cheese and breaded eggplant that's served in a big hearty casserole style chunk. The past few times i've ordered it, the whole thing was burned. I even sent it back one time to get a new piece and had the same problem. I miss this dish a lot. Not sure why they can't cook it right. Burned eggplant? I don't think so Maggiano's. Yummy tomato cream vodka sauce? Yes please.

So...I've driven by this place a million times and always wanted to try it. What a disappointment! My family is Italian and this place is as Americanized as it gets! I got the vodka tortellini dish. Was NOT good. If you are looking for an awesome vodka sauce, check out Maggiano's in Scottsdale. It's the best I've had here in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is really odd almost slightly creepy. We went for dinner and sitting in an office dinning room having dinner is somewhat strange. It is on the first floor of and office building so I can understand but still. Maybe this place makes more sense at lunch time but for dinner, weird. Check out their website and you will notice no pictures of the dining room.  www.alexisgrillphx.com  Our server was homophobic. There were three of us, myself and my two friends. He was cold and unfriendly. Being in the "gayborhood" I was pretty surprised. We all felt awkward and uninvited.  Bad food, strange atmosphere for dinner, unfriendly server.  I won't be coming back.

I've been going to North ever since it opened. Actually my whole family has been going there for a long time and the four of us are pretty damn hard to please. Dinner here is consistently good. WARNING: Parking is a bitch at dinner time but worth the hassle.  Favorite dish:  Pasta Bolognese - oversized shell pasta with seriously, the best meat sauce i've had in Phoenix, all toped with melted cheese.   The atmosphere is chic and modern with glass windows that look out on Kierland Commons. Can be noisy at times given the space is somewhat small and the bar and kitchen is open to the restaurant.  All in all...North is one of my favorite places to eat for many years.

Honestly, this is some of the best mexican food in town!  It's connected to a gay bar Charlies and homo's are not going to eat half rate food...so needless to say it's amazing. Gay, Bi, Straight, Tranny....it doesn't matter, everyone is welcome!  Suggestions: Chicken or Steak Quesadilla, Nachos, Bean Burro  Go....go now!

Ok....so I was super excited to go check this place out. I was pretty disappointed.  I had pizza on the mind and heard The Parlor had yummy pies. I ordered the pepperoni pizza. It came out with burnt bubbles all over the top and a completely burnt bottom. It was a huge disappointment. All I could taste was char. The only good thing about it was the over sized pepperoni slices which had great flavor.   I've heard the sandwiches are good but if you plan to get pizza, prepare yourself for some char. Yuck!

A couple nights ago I went to Eddie V's for my brother's birthday. (A Thursday) He raves about this place yet I always remember the other location being just ok. Anyway, the atmosphere of the new location is nice. About what you would expect...dark and cozy, however....the bathrooms are well...creepy? There are no doors on the mens or women's bathrooms. Women can walk right by the mens bathroom and see everything. They are more like big open rooms with a sink on one side. It was eerily silent with off putting lighting. You almost feel like you're in a creepy, dank hotel lobby. I couldn't wait to get out of there and back to my table. Oh and ladies, FYI...we can hear EVERYTHING you are saying. The two bathrooms share one large space.  Ok so let's get on to the meal. Before I came to Eddie's, I checked out the yelp reviews like I always do before I go to a new restaurant and made sure to try the crab cake. And let me tell you, everyone is correct. It's DELICIOUS. I just about licked the plate clean...and i'm not even a big seafood fan. Now, on to the main course. The whole reason my brother wanted to come to Eddie's was for an amazing steak. So both he and I ordered steak. He got the special which was a bone in filet mignon and I ordered the bone out filet mignon. We like our steaks cooked medium, pink all the way thru with no red. We always ask the server, regardless of where we go, what their version of medium is. He told us that their medium would be to our liking so we trusted that an excellent steakhouse would get it right......NOPE. Both $35+ steaks came out medium rare to RARE. My filet had ribbons of fat throughout the whole thing. Horrible cut of meat. I've had better cuts of meat at Outback. ZING! Everyone knows that when you order a steak and it's not cooked properly that it just ruins your meal. By the time they re-cook the SAME piece of meat its a charred burnt crisp. I decided to just eat mine but my brother sent it back and they STILL didn't get it right. Oh, on a side note, If you DO have a problem with your meat, the manager will come over with a light BLUE LED flashlight and inspect it like a medical autopsy. I mean come on...it made the meat look purple. GROSS. As far as my poor cut of meat...the manager could only say "we use the best cuts of meat" really?   Our waiter was nice, my only gripe about the service was that our plates were taken away from us from the bus boy without being asked if we were done yet. BIG NO NO.   In conclusion, The manager took the birthday boy's steak off the check. There was no special treatment for the occasion. I read in one review that someone got a birthday card signed by all the staff. That never happened. I gave Eddie's two stars instead of one only because of the crab cake. I will never come back here for steak. I suggest sticking with the seafood items.  UPDATE:  We received a credit to come back, hoping they could cook a filet correctly. THEY DID IT AGAIN! The can not properly cook a piece of meat. End of story. 1 star now.

PROS:   Newer style complex.  Security alarm in every unit.  Full size washer and dryer in unit. Gated garage. Crown molding. Attractive floor-plans.  CONS:  GARBAGE - Dumpster overflowing into the garage with trash. Garbage all over the garage and side walks. I've seen a full size, half eaten bag of popcorn thrown on the ground with popcorn spilled everywhere.  Recently had a Wal-Mart bag with shit in it near my front door. I promptly kicked it to the floor below. I mean, how does this happen? These are not small garbage items. A bag of microwave popcorn? Are you kidding me? I actually think it's kinda funny now. I look forward to seeing what absurd garbage item I will find next. Just this morning I found cotton swab type strands near my car. At first I thought it was a tampon but it wasn't. I have no idea what it was. Classic.   Conclusion? Trashy people leaving trash in a somewhat attractively newer complex.
