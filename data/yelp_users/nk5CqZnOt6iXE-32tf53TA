Love the bran muffins and scones. Terrific when picked up in the am. Usually they are still warm at 7:00am and freshly baked every day. 1 day old items are usually 1/2 price if you want to save a little money

Great services for home or business A/V needs. Have used for many years. Randy, is a great tech and the company has terrific employees with minimal turnover. I've used them for project both big and small. From installing home security system to mounting an HDTV. Very reliable and knowledgeable in anything and everything A/V!

Best place for Wings! I love picking up Wings from here for party, football games, or any occasion The medium and hot are my favorite but they have all flavors from honey hot, bbq, and regular. They are traditional type wings dont expect boneless or anything fancy. This a dive so if you plan on eating in, dont get your hopes up. Location is an old Long John Silvers and feels like a Filibertos inside. But remember looks can be deceiving, get your food to go and enjoy, other good sides are onion rings and potato skins.

I had the day off of work and decided to accompany my wife to our 9months old shots. We have a 7 yr and 10 yr old that have seen the same doctor.   As a dad I can honestly say my visits have been minimal. Today confirmed this reason.Bothered by bad to say about our dr, DR Guthrie, but let me share my experience.  We arrived 15min early to our appointment to be told that the Dr is not in today for "Our appointment" but that another dr was seeing  his Patients and was more than double booked. The front office lady said she couldn't tell us how long we would have to wait. Since we weren't rushed we opted to wait. The front office is not friendly and lacks basic customer service skills.   Needless to say we have been sitting here for 20minutes with no communication, so I have decided to communicate to the community!   Another major problem with our healthcare providers, nothing more frustrating than scheduling an appointment.

My kids love this place, just as much as I hate it. The food is worthless cardboard pizza. I spend to much money on ticket games. They need to step it up and actually get video games instead of token games. My wife claims the salad bar has given her food poisoning twice. Yet we keep coming back cause the kids love it. The stupid things we do for those that we love.

What can I say except that the kids love this place and adults are crazy if they feel the same. I remember going when I was a kid, I didnt want to deprive my kids of the same memories. Its just loud, dingy, bad food, etc. The best comparison is putting a skatepark inside of a locker room. I get suckered into going every year for our "school fundraiser"! Id rather just give them $20-$40 and not show up.   Spongebob comes out in full costume for the hokie-pokie dance, that may have been the highlight of my night!

Green chili anything is awesome! I always go for chicken sandwich w/ green chili mayo. Been going there for years and can't ever order anything else. No need to when you go there for what you want. They now have 2 locations one in N Mesa is good but definitely not the original, watch out for snow birds!

New favorite spot for my kids, they are so excited to go there its like a candy shop for rock lovers. Tried to offer my kids toys but they will choose this place anytime. No arguments on my part because the prices are very reasonable. Only bad thing i have to say is that I cant leave the place without buying something. Again its like a candy store for rock lovers. They do have other cool items in addition to their massive collection of rocks. Employees are also very helpful and educated on their items.

Wow, I've been driving past this place for years. Can't leave I haven't tried this place sooner. I went there for breakfast this morning and haft the amazing top-sirloin special only $6.99. It came with two eggs, an biscuit, and choice of hash browns or country potatoes. The staff is friendly and we got a few desserts from the bakery to go. Definitely returning for the lunch or dinner menu and to check out the meat department.

If your looking for a relaxing seat and calm place to chill this is not for you...(hence all you bad reviewers)  This place is for the concert enthusiast! If you are wanting to see a favorite band there isn't a more intimate local venue!  No seating(unless you want to sit outside on the patio and listen to music and not experience a live show!)  What a great place! Ampatheater styler venue, anywhere you go you can see the stage and feel like your part of a private show.   Definitely beats any large USaiways, Cricket Pavillion or large venue!  Different strokes for different fokes! If your not going to see one of your favorite bands your in the wrong place at the wrong time!  Thx Marquee, STP, Filter, and (a good friend Gabe) for a memorable time!

If you plan on going more than 2x nothing beats the annual pass. Water park in the summer is our kids favorite spot and an easy time killer during those long summer days!

If you need service on a camera or need assistance with a camera there is no better place to go. The employees know their stuff. I wish I could find a mechanic that I feel this comfortable with. Between work and wife I have spent enough with them to have a new car, but Im not one bit unhappy. Everything well spend from the service department to the sales department. Thx Tempe Camera!

Terrific staff and services! Spent 3 hours with 13 staff members and couldn't have asked for a better experience. Definitely impressed with the accommodations for a large party. We had 10 females am 3 males that had facials, massages and pedicures. Can't wait for opportunity to repeat. Channel was massage therapist and already scheduled to see again. Location is a lot larger than perceived. 6 massage rooms, 5 pedis, 5 manis, 6 facial rooms. If you haven't been here gotta give it a shot! Thx everyone!

I have seen this place for a long time but was always hesitant to visit. I have always been happy with Massage Envy. I called to check on the hours and they were very motivated to get me in. They accomodated my schedule and got me in same day. The massage was good, but the establishment is a little run down and not too nice. I may go back because of proximatey and price.

45,000 mile warranty on a set of $150 tires and after 20,000 miles tire blows. No new tires with "warranty" just a whopping $36 discount! I have since returned my business to Big-O

How many times do you feel comfortable with a mechanic? For me never, until I went to Sunland and have worked with multiple employees. They are honest, non-pushy and reasonably priced. I love this place and will continue to bring my vehicles in for all the necessary maintanence.

Really like this place but the customer service at this location has ruined my expectations for Five Guys and can give 2 stars only. I ordered 2 burgers and 2 fries to go. One burger with mushrooms and another burger without the bun. Waited a few minutes and they called my number, I was handed one brown bag and asked is this everything, he said, "Yes, 2 burgers and 2 fries". I got home and only had 1 burger. I was frustrated, called and asked what happened, they said oh sorry we forgot to give you the burger without a bun. I said I couldnt come back for 30min to pick it up. Upon my return, they didnt remake the burger but gave me the one they forgot to give, it wasnt even warm. No apology or compensation, acted as if it was my fault that I didnt get it. Very bad experience, I wont return to this location and hope other locations can deliver a 5 star experience

Great customer service, and what can I say about the products except for they are the best. For business I am usually there at least once a week for iPads, iPods, or other.   Plan on walking as the parking out front is very limited.  Business team is great and have me on a discount plan!

I'd give one star, but I love sports an just can't! For a sports superstore I expect a lot more. Definitely over priced, which I don't mind paying for Top-of-the-line items. But there selection and quality I mediocre, your better off going somewhere else. The mall has better clothing items for sports players. One advantage is if your looking for a unique item, or any "underarmour" clothing they probably have it. Sorry Dick I really was really hoping for a home run on this one!

Great place for boys mine never want to leave. They always have a great time. Dont bother paying adult prices unless you plan on jumping. Its well worth the time for adults its equally enjoyable just sitting, relaxing, watching, or taking pictures. Boys are aged 5 and 8 I would say 5-12 is the ideal age, although they do have a little kid area.

Typical comedy club with a 2 drink minimum. They pack a full house and put on great shows. I saw Anjelah Johnson and Mal Hall.   We had reserved seating as we accompanied family members. No seats are really better than others unless you are seated at the foot of the stage.  Similar to another review I had a server spill steak sauce all over my leg and arm. There was no apology or even recognition of their mistake. I didn't expect anything just disappointed there wasn't any acknowledgment.  After the show I had a chance to go back stage for photos, small talk, and good times. The greenroom is quite small about 20x20 is all.   A little tip is to arrive early and enjoy some drinks next door at the bar instead of exceeding your 2 drink minimum. Drink prices are a little over priced but the appetizers are worth the money! Got to try the Nachos!  Great times, enjoy the show!

Acai bowls are great and small little joint is authentic and fresh. Not the fastest if your in a hurry. The chocolate peanut butter is my favorite but they are all great. The small is very filling not sure who needs a large unless you plan to share it take home and freeze. The drinks are limited to smoothies and bottled water and tea. It would be nice to be able to order a nice coffee. They are currently remodeling to be able to have a juice bar. Been coming here since they opened and plan to continue to return.

Best poker room! Many tables to choose from and the wait times are minimal. I sat at a table that won the $10,000 jackpot and got to share in the winnings! The food is great, company is well rounded and the dealers are awesome. Thanks Jackie your the best. Or should I say jack-pot-Jackie! The table split $2,500 and $7500 went to the 2 players in the hand. The $3/6 or $4/8 are very friendly tables. The no smoking helps make the environment much more enjoyable! Fortunately I'm an addict and I will be back! Win or lose, it's always a good time!

Been going since they opened... Definitely on my favorite list. I recommend the kicker, chai tea (dirty, couple shots of espresso) or just a regular coffee with cream. The staff is very friendly and after a couple times they will call you by name and remember you favorite drink. They are very personable and certainly care about the customer. Always a line tho drive thru or walk up, but they are quick and will chat with you to pass the time. Watch out the granola bar is more addicting than the coffee

Great place and outstanding food. If you want something authentic you have to checkout Back Yard Taco. Its not your traditional mexican food, the Crazy Potato is amazing and I love the street tacos. I have already referred many family and friends.  Check them out you will be glad you do, or your LOCO if you dont!

New location and still great food, but the wait and service is still working out the kinks. Hopefully it can only get better. To there defense I was there the week they opened. Plenty of helpful happy staff it just took forever and they were out of items. Shrimp Burrito is awesome.

This place is worth a visit. If you like collectable, antiques, or just a good find. Well you definately going to find something here. The will allow you to negotiate your price of anything over $5. This place is not like a thrift store, it is well organized and the layout is very inviting. It also clean and staff is anxious to help you find anything or help with questions without being pushy or salesy... Check it out for sure!

Good place for some great food that isn't that heavy, fried stuff. I got the breakfast wrap, it was great, and I really enjoyed the rice instead of the potatoes inside of it. My wife ordered the bagel breakfast sandwich and enjoyed it as well. We both ordered a pressed juice, the skinny and the liver cleanse.  Lucky for us there was no line or waiting otherwise we would have purchased some of the cool items they have before the register. We really enjoyed our brunch and will definitely be returning.

Had a birthday party and rented 3 bays with food and drinks. (I didn't pay so not 100% on cost ) The service was amazing, our server was exclusive to our party and made she we had the food and drinks we needed. Our party ranged from 11months -60 years old, everyone had a good time. The seating is very comfortable, tv screens to watch the game, and amazing technology to keep score. Only bad thing was finding a parking spot. Good luck with that on a weekend next time I may just use their valet service.

Talk about a gem this place is just that. Hidden in NE Mesa in an industrial park. The outside seems uneventful and lackluster, but then you enter the building and the wow begins. The trampolines and pits put all the other parks to shame my kids have been to them all, and this is their favorite.  The food is a nice touch for us parents to stuff our faces while waiting for the kids. The price is based on time, typically an hr is worthwhile to tire the kids out.  The trampolines are also divided into different age appropriate areas. It is still semi-new and doesn't have a smell or stench of sweat that I associate some other parks I won't name.  Thx for a Krazy good time!

Good little place, nothing fast but the food and service make up for it. Got a dozen donuts with the kids and where else can you get fruit loops on your donut? I ordered an iced chai tea and a ham, cheese and jalepano croissant. Both were very good and I'll definitely be returning!

Fun, place! We walked in after brunch down the street and the staff was very friendly and greeted us. Everything was explained on what was offered. We wondered around and looked at the different items. And then chose a fun item to paint for pottery. They have items from bowls, cups, plates, ornaments, etc. They also allow canvas painting and certain classes for glass and other crafty items. Upon checking out the employee provided as a coupon for an additional 20% off what a nice gesture. The place is clean and professional, we plan to bring friends or kids with us next time.

Great little hole in the wall. Not a large place probably only 6 tables. We (family of 5) ordered the whole chicken. It came with 2 sides and we chose the beans and rice. Additional sides included pickled onions, salsa, and tortillas. The chicken had great flavor and was moist not dry. The only thing I thought was weird was the hotdog chunks in the pinto beans? Not bad just weird. Glad we found this place we will definately be returning as it reminds me of favorite spot in Rocky Point. This price is reasonable too, with 5 sodas and the whole chicken it was $27 dollars.  - Gracias Pollo Picante

Good addition to the neighborhood. Previous location was The Spot but really like the Thai menu. The lunch menu is perfect. An entre, salad, and egg roll. The interior is very similar to the old layout if you ever visited the Spot. If not it is a small joint, A couple table inside, and a loft for a a more private sitting area. Not great for large groups unless you plan for takeout. I will definately be returning.
