After years of frustration with discount places like Fantastic Sams and looking less than fantastic, I decided to treat myself with a haircut. I made an appointment and was given to Tesha. She ended up spending nearly an hour cutting my hair to make sure it was even and looked good. I have been a return customer since last fall, and plan to continue.  Is it a little pricey? Yes. Are the bedazzled Affliction-style wallets and purses kitschy? Yes. But I just ignore that and trust that my hair will come out looking great.

I used to like coming here for UFC...  The service has always been a bit questionable, but the food was decent enough to make up for it and best of all, no cover charge.   I came for lunch a month or so ago with coworkers and discovered the new menu. No more sweet potato fries, no more jalapeno bottle caps, no more cheese curds? Say it ain't so! Also, all new servers, and the bathrooms somehow have gotten even more disgusting. Functioning locks on the doors would be nice.  Tonight was the last straw. A waitress or manager, and then a child (yes, really) kept coming on over the speaker to announce the drink special. We'd been there since 5pm, and so had just about everyone else. The final time was DURING the lightweight title fight, mid-round.   I don't care if I have to pay a cover to go somewhere else. I'd like a wait staff that will notice garbage on the table from the previous customers and CLEAN IT OFF WITHOUT ME ASKING! C'mon! I'm not sure if most of the changes are due to a new owner or manager, but the servers need to be trained, and the overhead pages to announce drink specials need to stop. It's loud and annoying. Also, screwdrivers as a special on Saturdays is maybe appropriate in the morning, but how about long islands or rum and coke later on? I'm not going to drink a screwdriver with hot wings and pizza on a Saturday night.

I love this place. It's close to my office and I come about once per week. The soup bowls are massive and delicious, and I bring coworkers that probably never would have considered Vietnamese food, and now also share my love of it. I also used to dislike boba, but now I look forward to getting one when I come for my weekly bowl of noodles. My only complaint is the $10 minimum for credit/debit cards. However, by the time I get lunch and a boba, my bill is right around $10. I hate that I am forced to get a drink, but it's nitpicking, I could just as easily carry cash.

UGH! Why am I such a masochist that I keep trying this place thinking it will get better? This place is close to my office, and there aren't many good "healthier" options nearby, so I've been here a handful of times over the past year or so, but I'm putting up the white flag and surrendering, I will not be going back.  First, they put way too many onions on their gyro. Don't get me wrong, I love onion, but I think they only buy the stinkiest, strongest flavored onions available. I feel like I wreak for at least 24 hours after eating a few pieces of those puppies.  Second, the falafel is SO SALTY! I can't even bring myself to consume one entire falafel. Also, on at least one occasion, there was a hair in the falafel. Enough said.  Third, prices! Hello! Have you heard of a lunch crowd? I really don't want to pay $10 for a salad outside of a sit-down restaurant, and even then it better blow my mind. Salads are also, unfortunately, one of the most edible things served here. The veggies are fresh and the oil and vinegar dressing is good and simple. The chicken salad would earn 3 or 4/5 on its own, but not for $10 at lunch!  I must try to keep this a little positive. The pita bread is delicious, served warm and soft, but unfortunately, cannot save the rest of my bad experiences here.  Eat at your own risk!

I happened to be in the area and found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out for lunch. I got shredded chicken with rice, black beans, plantains, and it came with some sliced, pressed bread. The bread came out first, hot and delicious. I couldn't help myself and ate one of the four pieces before my food came out. The chicken was a little watery, but delicious. My favorite part of the whole meal were the plantains. OMG! Smashing the plantain with some rice and chicken was a little party in my mouth.  My only complaint is that the portions were large, and the price of the meal ($10 without a drink) was a tad high for lunchtime. I drive around a lot for work and can't take leftovers because they'll go bad and hate the idea of wasting that much food and money. Please consider smaller portions and lower lunch prices!

This is my favorite of all of the self-serve yogurt places that have popped up over the past few years, mostly because they have a lot more flavors than others I've been to, at least a dozen. These include no sugar added and plain. The toppings are numerous and range from healthy, to breakfast cereals, to "I'm going to regret this later." There are also different sized containers, but even the smallest is at least 16oz. I always see people in there going way overboard with the largest of the containers, but who in America knows what a normal portion is anymore these days? Being able to pour and mix the flavors and add in the toppings myself is a huge plus, and makes each visit unique.
