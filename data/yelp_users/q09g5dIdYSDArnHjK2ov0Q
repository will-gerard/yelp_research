I really love this place. I think the other reviewers have done a fantastic job of sharing what this place is all about. It's a little bit pricy, but that's no problem, just find yourself a groupon or one of the other many online deals this place offers.   I saw lizards, owls, all sorts of birds and adorable bunnies. The butterfly garden when it's open is wonderful. I really enjoy going for a walk here at sunset, just bring a lot of water when roaming around the desert gardens.

Omg. MOLD, mold everywhere!!!!   I bought two potato filled pastry's we get 3/4 through eating them and my boyfriend goes "Is that mold" we then pick the pastry shell apart and the entire thing is filled with thick black mold. This was hours after they were purchased!   In about an hour we were both feeling sick, I threw up which was terrible. I'm posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got. I'm shocked. I eat out everyday and have NEVER EVER had an experience like this.   I ordered Borsch off the menu as well, and they were out so he just opened a can they had on the shelf and added tap water (for $8.95) I have to say one word...  HORRIFIED!

Dr. Jesse Dominguez was beyond awesome. He made me feel so comfortable and explained everything and answered all my questions. I couldn't have asked for more! He gave me contacts to try the same day and they feel amazing and are so very comfortable. Five stars for him!

Alright, minigolf! Four different courses of mini golf, and rides! It's kind of crappy they don't offer individual rides but they do have a discount of buy one get one free if you're a AAA member. Badass! $4 a piece for minigolf? I say YES!   Unfortunately, the balls get stuck quite often. Annoying? Yes. But the courses are great and it's a lovely way to blow some time and have some fun with friends.   I took a friends kid here for some games and he seemed to have a blast. If you make a day out of it, I suggest taking your children and getting a package deal. Take water with you (it's not cheap at the facility), bring some snacks and tucker those kids out so they will fall into bed.   They even have a zip line!

Really nice attendant. She was such a doll. Bonus - They don't charge to try on wigs! Found two great wigs for under $70 (total charge).   Lots of trashy looking isles in here, but it's a beauty supply store ;) -1 star for the awkward lines at the front desk.

I don't care what the haters say! I love this place.   Great deals on brand names that I just can't get enough of. Never any problems with returns. Gosh, I spend way too much at this place. I just can't help myself.  Want the best deals? go first thing in the morning. That's when the shelves are stocked. Don't park right infront of the building. I've seen two vehicles get hit this way. Park back a little further. Oh yeah, and right around the corner? Costco! Can't beat it!

If you would like a dining experience that will leave you absolutely floored, this is where you need to go. The management is friendly and the service is fantastic, the menu is rotating so everything is changing frequently. We got to Travelzoo and were incredibly impressed and even added on in an extra appetizer.   This restaurant is family-owned and the owner was present and incredibly pleasant in making sure our experience was top notch.   We had the cheese pastry as well as a lobster cake app, the wine was great and our waiter was patient and knowledgable. The lamb? What presentation!  The chef is visible in the kitchen is open and you can interact with him at the tapas bar. Come on in you will be disappointed.  I love this place so much I had to drop the review before getting dessert so I'm gonna go enjoy that now and you guys enjoy this when you come in! Nom.

Food is good, ribs were fall off the bone tender. Brandon was a huge fan of the Mac and Cheese which certainly has a kick!  What I really appreciate is the manager's attitude. John's great! He really cares about the customer and making things right. I used to review restaurants professionally, and he really gets it. Go here if you want great service, and chug some half priced beer!

The air was humid, and it smelled terrible. The food was decent - but for a two and a half hour wait to be rushed out of the buffet 20 minutes after paying. Oh my god! The ice cream machine was turned off less than 20 minutes after we entered the buffet. I got a migraine from the scent heavy air - it made me nauseous. Tons of tables were free, but the staff was so lacking that they couldn't even clear off the tables for the hours of lines. I really should have paid more attention to the reviews on here. I wouldn't eat at this restaurant if it was free.  Note: The smell was very VERY bad - note, it was VERY humid, note - it was greasy and ..... auggggh so bad... so so so so so bad.

Went for breakfast - I remember this place being much better several years ago. Waiter was kinda a dick (until I tipped him!), the food was mostly cold (I'd say over 60% of the food was at room temperature). The bonus - no wait. Blackberries are good.

Expensive. Ordered lamb medium rare, and got it rare/blue was still good, center was cold. Filet was ordered rare but arrived medium/well, waiter was curt and disagreed that my steaming hot brown and light pink meat was actually rare, um no.   The meat was dried out and there was no blood in sight. They fixed it but no apologies. Pork tenderloin was dried out. Veggies were fantastic. Could be more friendly, especially when you drop $140 on two people.

So far, so GOOD! After I was wronged by Seoul Korean Grill, I tried to find another Korean place, failed! Then I turned around to go to Wendy's and it was like the Gods had shone upon me. A Korean restaurant? Right in front of my face? I took directions to another on yelp and it took me back to Seoul! It must have shut down. The tragedy!  So here I am, It looks like a dive bar from the outside and I mosey inside and the waiter is all class! Great sense of humor. Ask for Kyle, he's a swell guy!!!  I'm like starving, and the bimibap arrives in no time! It's great, but a fried egg? Not for me! I was brought out a raw one in seconds with no charge. The tender rib meat was amazing. Mmm... I'll be back.

The service is suck. I tipped over 35% the first several times I went in and they didn't even remember me, hmm. Then they brought me out the wrong food and didn't even fix it, hahaha! Okay, regular 15-20% for you!  Okay, so let me put that aside and say, cook the food yourself. The BBQ combos are great. I love the green onion salad it is so addictive and so amazing and I could probably eat pounds of it. It's lame that they charge more for basically everything but it's a nice place to go, and I believe they use a few pieces of charcoal in with the gas grill adding extra flavor.   The restaurant itself is very small, but if you're a nerd check out the gaming store on the same block. They've got magic, board games and warhammer.

Damn, the workers here are terrible. I went to buy an item that was on sale, and they took it up for the front for me and realized the sale tags were out of date so one of the workers disposed of them before I got to the checkout! I was buying $400+ worth of items, and I still had to argue with them to get the advertised price. Next time I went into the store, the $79 signs were back up. They tried to charge me $125. The cashiers and managers always cop major attitude, yet I go back again and again because its a decent store and close to home.

Dave is awesome. He works in electric and helped us out with absolutely everything, even out of his section. We had several home projects we have been working on and he made sure we had the right tools for everything AND was concerned about us saving money, even when I just shrugged it off and didn't really care about the price, he explained the specifics of exactly what I needed and why. Always greeted with a friendly hello by every single employee! The customer service in this store is a shining example of how it should be!   They now also accept paypal.

Perhaps I went on a bad day? I'm not sure. Mushy - mushy, ick. It seems like you taking a bunch of stuff that is supposed to be great together - mashing it together without any care for texture or the final product in general. I have to say I was supremely disappointed. Huge lines. The french onion soup? It's pretty sad. The beer? It's $5 for domestic.  Bleh.

Got a killer deal for this restaurant from Travel Zoo. For about $90 after tip we got 2 appetizers, 2 sides, two entrees up to $35 each, two drinks, and two desserts. Wow!  The waitress was great. Starting out was Tuna Tartar and Crab Fritters. The Tuna Tartar was great, very yummy. The crab fritter appetizer was overcooked and incredibly small and came with a very large bowl of tartar sauce, still tasted OK. For our entrees we both chose the filet which came out cooked entirely wrong, they fixed the problem with no muss and came out with fresh rare filets for the both of us and apologized. The Bernaise sauce is really lousy, way too heavy on the egg and no where near enough butter. The flavor in it was very eggy and I think they just failed in adding shallots or something else to it... The horseradish sauce was creamy and delicious. The sides, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were incredibly salty and almost inedible and I love heavy salt in my food. The deserts were both fantastic and absolutely the highlight of the visit.   For the ambience, it's very loud. Very, very loud when the restaurant is full. As for the Bartender, the first time he made my Colorado Bulldog perfectly, the next two times it was either curdled or bitter and terrible. I didn't say anything about it after they fixed the curdled drink I felt bad for the waitress!   Overall, I think it's decent to go here if you have a deal. It's not a bad place, but it's certainly no Mortons!

Dave Colwell is my personal hero. After sinking in 1,500 at Fairway Auto Phoenix and having my vehicle sink with it. I was left with a broken A/C and heating, when that's what I took it in for! They said they were satisfied with the service and handed me off the keys after a few days. Guess what? It was the same as when I brought in the vehicle! Yikes! They wanted to charge me another $1300! So, there was no way I was going back. I knew I had to go to an actual Jeep Dealer. That's when I called Dave!   I drove out from Phoenix to Scottsdale, Dave and his car guy were on their way home but stayed late just for us as the traffic and picking up the vehicle from Fairway had us a little behind. We handed the car over to Dave who was extremely professional and he had out problem fixed in 5 minutes!!!   Dave Colwell saved me $1300+!   I know where I will be taking my business from here on out.

Oh gosh, it was hot out. I am going to dish this place a decent rating! Brandon R. and I both brought our two liter water backpacks as we were told you lose two liters an hour in the desert and we weren't allowed to bring them along on the trail. They said they would give us water for the ride, and we were given 5oz bottles of water. Oh gosh not enough.   The ride itself was very lovely, albeit slow! The guide was nice and humorous. We both enjoyed ourselves. The lack of water turned out to be a little torturous. Turns out the guide took us on the one hour instead of the two hour track, so we were given a few more 5oz waters a piece when we were accidentally took back to the stable area. It still wasn't enough I came out with a fever and a headache from lack of water.   They have moonlit rides and I would definitely go back. Especially knowing they have private rides where you can blaze around the trails. I recommend you bring a bandanna to keep the sand and grit out of your nose and mouth as it can get a little irritating.   It was wonderful riding the horses into the sunset.

This store is run like a CHARM. I've dreamed for years of the perfect turkey and stuffing sammie, and I could not ask for ANYTHING more than having it served up by such amazing people. Everyone who works here really understands how a business should be run. From the friendly smiles and playful attitudes - this place just has great vibes. Don't forget to leave these guys some BEEEEER money! haa! Oh yes!

Can't beat the price and variety. It's great for what it is, a cheap Chinese buffet and grill. I skip the sushi and load up on sweet and sour soup, Chinese donuts and sesame balls with green tea ice cream for dessert!   I've blown way too much cash in those quarter sliders. Whee! Convent location by the mall and nerd table top gaming store not far.

Review UPDATE!!!!   After reading my own review I checked GroupOn for deals and I just had to eat here again!   Yes, the food is good but the management staff are lacking in foresight and intelligence. I bought a GroupOn Now for this restaurant that's main fare is ALL YOU CAN EAT. Guess what? They refused to accept it! What? $20 for $12 on a $80+ bill?   We sit down, order our first $12.50 drink, and say all you can eat, oh and, we have a GroupOn. They say "That is not valid for ALL YOU CAN EAT". I say, check the GroupOn fine print, there are no specifications! I spent $135 in this restaurant last time I was here. It's only $8 off!   They refuse!  I pay off the drink and walk out. I eat out nearly everyday, and I will not be going back. Perhaps the manager needs some management skills. They would have easily made $500 off me this year. It's not like they didn't need the customers, we were the only table seated as the only other patrons walked out moments after we walked in.   ~~~ Previous review.   You can get nearly any kind of awesome seafood or meat all unlimited for like $25! Oh Gosh! I love it. They actually comped a drink for me because they were out of what I wanted! Now that's great service.   The only thing they could do is have charcoal grills, they really intensify the flavor and make the meat so much better. That and temperature control (the AC was blasting so much I had to bring in my blanket from the car) are the only reasons I'm not giving them five stars.

Okay, the low reviews? I don't get it! This place is as cheap as dirt.   I'm reviewing this place on it's price point. They've got tons of dishes, insanely cheap take-out after 9PM (half off) and comfy booths. Don't go here for sushi and expect a delicacy. Expect tons of food, tons of variety, some good sweet and sour soup and ALL YOU CAN EAT!

Bah! I really wanted to love this place. The lady who did my hair was excellent. Just fantastic. She did such a wonderful job on my hair that even three days ago, I am sexy still! Now, here is why I am giving this place a WHOPPING two stars.   First off, they use an answering machine service. Their google places address was wrong. When I called, they have no phones in the actual location only a call center who had no idea how to direct me to the location. Took 15 minutes to get into my actual appointment. When I taked to the manager/owner, she called me a liar even when I was showing her the google pin on google places myself, with the "directions" on my phone. She blamed the problem on me? I was asked for a tip several times after I had left one with the lady who had done my hair (over the suggested tip). I noticed the manager was offering wine to ladies who were dressed up with make-up on and water to everyone who was younger, or dressed down. This is not a great way to get business!

Hmm, these cupcakes are not very good. I've tried gourmet cupcakes all over north america and these taste a lot like cake mix. The icing is uninspired. I've given them a two star because they have awesome customer service, and they arrive on time. Delivery option is amazing. Don't get me wrong, the cupcakes are OK! They just aren't gourmet.

This is a great place.   They run amazing deals like GroupOn $5 for a movie ticket and soda (I don't recommend anyone drinks soda with HFCS), but I digress. They also have charity days where you can bring in a canned food item for free admission.   Now, down to the nitty gritty. Nice theatre, much better than most brew and views I've been to. The seats could be more comfortable, they recline but then they bounce right back. The other seating is just like your computer office desk at home. The food is hit or miss. They failed to declare that the grilled cheese is actually more like american plastic cheese sandwich. The other food was good, but the service is rather fail. Ordered the 4 appetizer combo, and they came out with three items. Yet again no apologies, what is with service these days?   The screens are great and just like a regular movie theatre, it just sucks when they fail to dim the lights until half way through the movie. It makes the 3D glasses reflect like crazy. Overall it's worth a go, a bit pricy (for the food/drinks) but enjoyable none the less. I just bought 10 movie passes on GroupOn. Oh Yeah.

Ladies did a great job of finding me the hair straightener of my dreams. It's amazing. It's going to save me 15-20 minutes a day. Absolutely KILLER!   Foundation? I am never ever happy with it. I've spent hundreds at Sephora trying to get the right one. I've tried Make-up forever, Nars, Bare Minerals, Dior, and (non-sephora) Mac, you name it! I used Lancome in the past and loved it, but somehow totally forgot they existed. The make-up artist/saleswoman helped me extensively by pointing out this amazing foundation by Lancome that is so silky with my skin. This location is worth a vist, ask for Dee.

For the price it can't be beat. Some food was cold. The grill masters were workin their butts off at top speed so I gave them a fiver. Lots of variety. Good stuff all over. Green tea ice cream! Cheapo sushi. Roast beef. Fresh grill steak.   Blow some money in the quarter pushers.  Taking off a star for restroom cleanliness.

I am writing this review for the killer deal I got with a GroupOn for brunch for four with unlimited mimosas!   We got seated quickly, all food was available and good! The beans were a little flavorless, and so was the fajitas, but that was solved easily by melting some cheese into the beans and mixing in some of that amazing salsa. They brought our table of five a lovely plate of sliced fruit, as well as a few baskets of tortilla chips with salsa accompaniment. The salsa verde was fantastic. I mixed it in with everything I threw into the flour tortillas, which were piping hot, soft and wrapped in foil to keep them that way. they also had corn tortillas available.   They also had bananas, pancakes, bacon, pan fried potatoes (with or without chirizo), yogourt with strawberries, and moreeee!    Orange juice mimosas could get a little boring but they had Jamaican, Regular, and Tamarind. The waitress was very on point and would not let them go empty. She kept filling our glasses long after the buffet ended and kept us very happy and drunk!   My conclusion is that the GroupOn customers who attended this restaurant came when the restaurant was totally unprepared for the volume of customers. We had a great experience.   Bonus: Migo's is closely located to Arizona Mills. Get your shop on GURRRL!

This place rocks for cao! I've been here a few times now for the food and the Karaoke. The spring rolls are unique, they rock. I usually get the bun with extra meat and an extra spring roll. I love the people here, they are all really nice. It's just a really fun place to hang out. Definitely some pro karaoke goers here, but they don't mind the amateurs having a great time. Service has always been top notch!

Fantastic! I don't understand how this place isn't bangin' with a line out the door. Sushi, great flavors but I really got to agree with the other reviewer when she said she hasn't had tacos this good out of Mexico. Neither have I, and man have I been chasing that flavor. Carne Asada baby, with a side of sushi. Sounds gross? Oh no, its sooooo good. Damn!
