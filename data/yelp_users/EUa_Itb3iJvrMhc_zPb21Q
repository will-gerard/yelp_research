If you have little kids you'd be a fool to pass an opportunity to bring them here. Train rides, carousel rides, model trains and concessions are all great.

I used Robert's to cater a post-wedding cocktail party.  All I can say is, Wow!  We served a variety of hors d'oeuvres and prime rib sandwiches.  They cooked the beef on demand which added a nice touch to the event.  We also ordered a cake that was both beautiful and delicious!  I gave them a picture of a cake, from the internet, to work from. The cake that was prepared was exponentially better looking.  I wanted to kiss the baker, it was totally gorgeous.  We received so many compliments on the food and the staff.  We did have a small issue with the filling in the cake not being what we expected, but when I discussed it with the office staff, they were apologetic and made it up to us after the fact.  They also helped us with additional rentals that we needed at the last minute.  I couldn't be happier with the service I received.

I hate to ruin a five-star rating but as a repeat customer I was very disappointed with the customer service I received here.  I came in for an estimate.  After 3 days I called I see if estimate had been submitted and was told they were having trouble with the insurance company's website. 8 days later insurance still had not received the quote from KK and when I called to find out why, I was told my rep was at lunch and would return my call.  That was 2 weeks ago. Never called me back. No worries. I guess they didn't need my business.  I took it elsewhere.

The chopped salad is a symphony of textures and flavors.  So good it has its own Facebook page!Excellent service and delicious food makes this a good choice.  It might be a little expensive, but you are worth it.
