Very disappointed. I have been using Honey Bears BBQ for several years and always had a reasonable experience up until about a year ago. I used them a lot for catering orders (30+ people) and also used them on regular office orders (10+ people). They recently started cutting their portion sizes way back so much so that I would have to order for 20 when I needed it for 10. The huge disappointment was when I ordered Honey Bears for a retirement party in the office (I made the order a week in advance). The day before they were supposed to deliver I called to confirm the order, the woman on the phone stated that they wouldn't make the delivery time that was quoted on the invoice - not acceptable when you have an office full of people waiting on their lunch. So I offered to pick it up, when I arrived at the Van Buren location, I had to wait 30 minutes for the order which was still way beyond the quoted time. I was also told at the cash register that they "were out of peach cobbler that day" so none of my guests received dessert - which may have not been a big deal except for the fact that it was a retirement party. The people assisting at the front counter and the helpers were all rude and unfriendly and did not care that the order was late or that they didn't have the complete order prepared...they have been around a long time but their customer service is AWFUL as in - they don't have any.

Flo's used to be a fav. I ordered the pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. It didn't have a lot of flavor and it bordered on kind of gross. I am sure I will try Flo's again but even the crab puffs tasted like they were cooked the day before.

As much as I would like to say my stay here was great...,it was AWFUL. I won't bore you with every detail but I will say the service (at all three pools) is terrible.not to mention the huge bug/ant problems at the pools. Normally, we stay at the Westin Kierland - where I have always had great experiences (and they actually treat you like a valued guest) but we thought we would give the Princess a try. Big mistake, we won't be back. EVER.

The menu is amazing. Every time I have visited there is usually a wait but it really doesn't take long to get a spot. The menu selection will have something for everyone. The service is friendly and the food is nom.

I have been getting massages off and on for over fifteen years but once I went to John I have never gone anywhere else. John always takes the time to listen before he gets started and his technique is amazing. One of the things I like most about Space is that John adjusts his technique according to my current needs or "pains". Usually, John has a better understanding of the current imbalance, aches and/or pains that my body is feeling better than I do and he knows how to heal them. I fully trust his craft and always feel 1000x better after an appointment. I really don't know what I would have done without him all these years!!

I have been practicing at FY off and on for approx. two years. It is a wonderful studio, amazing teachers with a very comfortable, friendly, clean atmosphere. I usually practice hot yoga but I recently decided to try a Yin Yoga class. I was simply amazed. It was a very peaceful and healing experience. Highly recommended! I am so thankful this is the first place I ever practiced hot yoga as every experience i have had at Floo-id  has been such a peaceful and positive experience.

Phoenix Glow is absolutely amazing. I have been going here for a year. Ann is remarkable, she is always very friendly, treats her customers very well and is very professional. She makes you feel at ease with the process and gives you a PERFECT tan every time. (She is also a great resource if you are looking for other health & beauty related services around the valley.) Extremely knowledgeable and provides fantastic service!!

This place is magical no doubt. I have to admit, I was a bit leary based on the reasonable price and the community atmosphere since I have never experienced anything like this. However! I have had a pinched nerve in my back  for over a month that was becoming debilitating. After one visit I have an amazing level of relief from the pain. Not only is my back feeling better, but I am feeling lighter and my overall body is feeling much better. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
