I love this Petsmart.   I've been here every Sunday since I've gotten my crazy dog over a month ago. Puppy training, puppy adoptions, puppy coupons...puppies.  Love it.

What awful service!   I went there to look at an apartment. The lady tossed me a key and a map and went back to what she was going (which was staring mindlessly at a computer screen).   I stumble around looking for the apartment. When I finally found it, I knew it was the one. The apartment of my dreams. I've been looking for months! And this was it.  So when I walk back to the leasing office to ask for an application she hands me my drivers license and proceeds to ignore me. I waited for like 5 minutes and this lady is completely dismissing me.  I finally leave and I try calling the office back one last time to see what I can do to get in that apartment and they pick up the phone and hang up right away.  I'm done.

I am a really picky tipper. I need some exceptional service to tip the whole 15%. However, i tipped 50% here...why? Because our server was SO NICE. He was beyond exceptional.  I'm currently on a primal diet (no dairy, no gluten, no processed anything). I told him my diet limitations and he didn't seem fazed in the least. He told me about other ingredients that he'll remove that wasn't mentioned on the menu, and was super helpful and accommodating of my weird eating habits.  Plus! The food was good! The place was clean! The atmosphere was really relaxed and casual.  This place was great and I'll definitely be coming back.

Smells really odd in there.   But you sometimes gotta do what you gotta do to get Plum Flavored Ramune.

I LOVE WINGS. I love love love wings. But I didn't love Buffalo Wild Wings.   I've read the previous reviews about service experienced at BWW and want to clarify that I didn't dine in, I simply called in my to go order.   I don't know how something as simple as calling in a to-go order could be so screwed up. I literally called - just ordering two small orders of wings, they said "Great, it'll be ready in 10 minutes!" Well great! I show up 10 minutes later and it's not busy, it was like a Tuesday afternoon. There were waitresses chilling out and talking - it was relaxed. So why did I have to wait an extra 20 minutes for my wings? It had been 30 minutes from my original phone call by the time I got them.   Following that - the wings sucked! So, so, so greasy - yuck!  However I must list the positives: (which is why I gave my review an additional star) I was greeted with a smile when I came in.  A nice looking manager asked me if I was okay after watching me wait for 15 minutes in the lobby. The cashier apologized for the wait.  So I was treated nicely, but I'm not going to ignore the fact I waited 30 minutes for 2 small wings that were disgusting.

This place was really fun.  It's located in a REALLY creepy part of Phoenix. Like the kind where you wanna drive a crappy car to because you don't want to leave your nice car parked on the street...(that sounded totally snobbish and mean but I just really thought the area was sketch).  But once you get inside, the place lights up! The music is loud and hypnotizing. You could tell the musicians really loved their art, because they put so much soul into their music. Besides that (since I'm becoming a slight alcoholic) the drinks and bartenders are great! They have EXPERIENCED bartenders at Char's so you get advice on drinks and well made drinks.   Char's definitely serves an older crowd (more late thirties to early fifties) but I had a blast and I'm 21. It's just a really chill time.  I wish I could comment on the prices of the drinks but all my drinks were paid for by other people (YAY)!

I am definitely a fan of 480 Bar! This place is not located in the best part of Chandler, and it may be a little awkward to find parking, but I love it. Looking at previous reviews, everyone stated how clean this place was, and for a dive bar - it is fantastically clean. The booze was cheap and the waiters/waitresses were decent people.The crowd here is also really fun, they have younger people, middle aged people, bikers, suburban parents, and me! I will ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY be back. P.S their karaoke night was off the chain!

Worse experience ever. Doesn't even deserve one star.  For some reason I was craving pizza, and since dominos is closest I decided to just go there and pick up a pizza.  All I ordered was two small one topping pizzas and pizza bites. Well I was there for over 40 minutes waiting. I saw that the guy had forgot to put in the order which contributed to the long wait, but he didn't care.  When I finally got my order, the pizza was cold, and I was pissed off from waiting for so long. When I brought this to his attention he just said "sorry" and walked away.  Maybe if the pizza was decent, I would have been semi-appeased about the situation. But it wasn't, and I wasn't.  In the future, get your pizza from somewhere else, because this place was awful.

I just got a new puppy and noticed he was getting sick. My neighbor had recommended Oasis, and since it was so close I decided to go there. From the moment I walked in I felt comfortable. The place was clean, and the receptionists were really nice.   However, what should have been a routine vet visit turned into a nightmare when I found out my new puppy had developed a fatal virus. Dr. Boyce was very direct (which I needed) and seemed so willing to help me out in the situation. I was such a blubbering mess. And the two other vet techs seemed so genuine as well (Brandon and another woman with brown hair).   I did have to go to another vet because of the terms on warranty from the pet shop, and I've been able to get my puppy properly hospitalized, but I do want to thank Oasis for giving me such a great experience despite the horrible circumstances.

Went for Happy Hour, it was a pretty decent deal. Tostada appetizer was delish. The chambord margarita was also a a treasure.

I don't know why there are so many bad reviews! I love Macayos. The food is great, and the service is great. Yes, the drinks are a bit pricey - one margarita being upwards $8-11 but happy hour is great and if you ask they sometimes have drink specials like 2 for $14 margaritas.   If I had to recommend a meal I would recommend the chimicanga con queso - yum yum yum.   Get a beer or a margarita and just sit back enjoy the awesome atmosphere and great food.

Barrio raises the bar.  I feel...like every other place that I gave 5 stars should be knocked down a star. This is what real 5 stars is.   I don't know what I liked better: the service, my enchiladas, my margaritas, or my churros. I'm totally serious.  I loved this place.  Holy hell. Could you imagine if this place was closer to me? I'd be broke as a joke and obese.  I loved this place. I don't know what else to say about that.

I must first start off and say I've never had steak before. I was advised by my friend if you're gonna have steak, you might as well have the best. So we decided Tom Colicchio might know a thing or two about steak. Therefore if you are a steak connoisseur, look at someone else's review!   Pros: Very nice casual atmosphere  My water glass was always filled... always... like if I just think about my water I see a water person waiting in the corner ready to refill my glass  Very little noise,  not like creepy deserted quietness, more like a nice low murmur.   Waiter and all the staff we met were very kind and courteous about everything  Cons:  I don't know if it'll be too memorable. The food was good, the service was good but when I come back to Vegas again I'm not going to be like "I have GOT to go to Craftsteak, like OMG gurl."  4 stars

I'm sad to only give this place 2 stars because I was SO excited to go there!  But I digress. 2 stars is all RM seafood will receive from me.  RM is located downstairs near the Mandalay Bay casinos. Known for their specialty of seafood and the fact that the owner Rick Moonen appeared on Top Chef Masters as a contestant.   The atmosphere was really nice and very classy. (Definitely too classy for me.) It was also far enough away from the casinos to not be a hindrance in regards to noise.   My waitress was amazing, she made me a special drink for my 21st birthday and was really attentive and genuine.  So the service was amazing and the ambiance was beautiful. Why two stars? The food was a huge disappointment.   We ordered sushi, Mac & Cheese, clam chowder, the salmon, and bread pudding. The sushi was nice, but that's it, just nice. From a seafood master I expected amazing. The clam chowder was just...nice. There were more raw vegetables in the soup than anything else. I didn't even taste the clams. The salmon with a potato crust was odd. They weren't two flavors that meshed as well for me, and I didn't enjoy the dish at all. The Mac & Cheese with pulled pork was absolutely disgusting. I'm so sad because I love Mac & Cheese. Now usually people eat ribs with a side of Mac & Cheese. It is a perfectly normal combination. But the pulled pork inside of the Mac & Cheese...so wrong.  Because the food was the reason I wanted to go to RM Seafood, and because the food was such a let down, I have to only give this restaurant two stars.

What a horrible experience.  We were looking for somewhere close to home to drink at. Chandler isn't that exciting but we were hoping that because of all the amazing reviews and the fact that it was Happy Hour that Iguana Mack's would be decent.   We were sorely mistaken.  As soon as we walked in we were assaulted by someone belting Adele on karaoke. After the initial scare, I started to smile. Drunk people doing karaoke is usually very entertaining. So we went to the bar to enjoy the show.  The bartender was hard to get ahold of but when we finally did, he was gruff and didn't even card us! It's not like we look old, we just turned 21 last month! And he made us the worst drinks!!! Apparently ordering anything besides beer is a set up for failure.   After the drinks, we were ready to leave because this place was already becoming irritating just from the bartender. Unfortunately we had already put in an order for appetizers.   Those were just as bad as the bartenders drinks.   The karaoke wasn't funny because they MC's were old and unattractive. They were trying to be funny and saucy but they just ended up sounding perverted.  Definitely not going back there!

I first just wanted to say that I was devastatingly underwhelmed by B&B Ristorante.   My friend and I planned our Vegas trip. We were going to at least see one show and eat at one really fancy restaurant.   We made a reservation, dressed up showed up here expecting an amazing dinner. We were originally served chickpea bruscetta and then I got the infamous Mario Batali beef cheek ravioli and my friend got the Alberto's Pyramids.   The first bite of my ravioli made me pause. It was just unexpected -an aquired taste. I let my friend have a taste and she immediately disliked it. I tried her Albert pyramid and got a very "meh" feeling from it.   Each little thing they gave us from the bread to the broccoli and the main courses to little ending sweet tray they gave us just seemed very "meh". It was a good meal. But we should have left thinking "that was an amazing meal." We should have wanted dessert. Like we saved up to pay for a good meal and this was just "OK".  Which sucks because I am mentally engaged to Joe Bastianich.

I recently bought a car at Big Two, and I've been waiting until I had time to write a decent review because the service I experienced at Big Two was phenomenal.   I actually went to a few dealerships looking for an affordable car and lower car payments. I'm a yelper, I noticed a lot of things about a place and customer service can make or break a place for me. So when I previously visited Car Max, and Power Toyota I was immediately repelled due to the lackluster customer service. It wasn't that way at Big Two.   Kindra, (the manager), Tyler (a sales associate), and Brandon (finance guy) were better than I could imagine. They were just so genuine.   Kindra bought my mom and I lunch while we waited for all the papers to be put in order. Brandon, the finance manager, didn't offer any weird add ons and extra services I didn't need. And Tyler, was great.  Tyler was just the sauce boss. I seriously cannot say enough about how amazing I think Tyler was. I casually mention worrying about insurance payments if I were to get a sports car and he calls the insurance place. I mention wanting a car big enough for my dog with a sun roof and push to start and pretty soon I have an entire list of cars that fit my qualifications. And his amazingness didn't stop after the sale was final. He texted me the next day making sure everything was fine. I had some type of issue with the radio and he personally gave me all kinds of suggestions and made sure I brought it in and got it fixed right away.  When I went to Big Two Toyota, I felt like I was precious.

This place is great.  The red bean ice shaving is bomb. The milk boba teas hit the spot.  The decoration of the place is unique, there are graffiti on the walls, and magazine clippings all over the tables - I see the attempt at making it "street like" but I don't know if they accomplished it. However, the place is clean and the food stuffs and service is great. So I'll definitely be back here soon.

Did not like the Chandler location but this one was great! The food was amazing and the drinks were perfect. Because the specialty burgers were part of happy hour, we all got burgers and weren't disappointed!   The only reason this doesn't get my full five stars was because the service left something to be desired.

Mercy Gilbert's motto is "hello human kindness"  Every person I have met at Mercy Gilbert is literally the personification of human kindess.  My mom went in to have a preventative surgery yesterday and it's like we had our own pit crew. We had a personal pre-op nurse, doctor, anesthesiologist, intern, post-op nurse, and recovery nurse - every single one of them came by talked to me, remembered my name, and answered my questions. In the waiting room during surgery, volunteers come out with puppies to help entertain the waiting families and just bring lightness to the room.   I would trust Mercy Gilbert with every single one of my family members. I adore this place.

I did not like this Urgent Care, and I doubt I'll ever go back.   This place seriously needs to take some customer service lessons from Dignity Health, it's like they have no idea how to treat a sick person. There was no greeting, no smile - they never looked into my eyes once. The main secretary guy greeted me with a "take a seat, don't stand around the front desk, and fill out this paperwork." Never once looked at me, smiled or anything. The doctors and the rest of the staff were like that too. The doctor came in, used is stethoscope on me, and declared that I had a cold flu that had turned ugly and that was all. He gave me some prescriptions for meds and walked out. The whole ordeal, from walking in to walking out was about 30 minutes. It was efficient, but impersonal. When I'm sick, I want to feel confident in my doctor and my diagnosis. I had no idea what the prescriptions were for, what they were going to do, what I was supposed to do if I got worse (which I did), or how this could have been prevented.   Would not reccomend to anyone.

I was hesitant about coming here. I just wanted a margarita and some sub-par food to absorb the tequila. Finding out that I was being taken to some fast-casual burger place without alcohol was slightly disappointing to me. I sucked it up and went on Yelp to see what's good here, and imagine my surprise to see over 700 reviews with an average of 4 stars. Suddenly, the afternoon started to look up.  Based on Yelp reviews, I ordered the Fontina Burger with garlic fries, my friends ordered The Farm Burger and BBQ Bleu Cheese Pizza, and together we shared the Butter Pecan Shake.  The first bite of my burger made me forget all about cool refreshing margarita waiting for me at some hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. My burger was better than alcohol --- fuck that noise. This is clearly going to earn my five stars.  After I embarrassed my friends by moaning out loud while eating my burger I was actually stoked about my garlic fries. Imagine my surprise to find out that I hated them. I hated the garlic fries. I love garlic, I love fries, but I HATED these garlic fries. Actually, I hated them so much I forgot how much I loved my burger. They were just so pungent and strong and overwhelming. I was eating raw garlic on soggy, oily fries. Eck, just remembering it makes me queasy.   I had a five star burger and a 1 star side of fries, that unfortunately averages out to 3 stars. However, my friends raved about their food so I'm bumping up to four and calling it a night. A good margarita will surely erase the taste of garlic fries from my person.

As with every place, it starts off with five stars.  However, as soon as we walk into the door we get carded. And if we're over 21 they put bracelets on us. I think that is the stupidest thing. I mean I saw other reviewers complain about this and thought that they would get rid of that stupid policy but no. It's just as dumb as everyone talks about.   Subtract 2 stars  The atmosphere: I liked it to be honest. It was casual and relaxed and the place was clean. Even if I wasn't on a date I would come back with my friends for a few drinks and some crap talking.  Add a star.  The food: was average. Nothing too special. I hated that they make you pay more for eel sauce whereas Ra, the most expensive sushi place ever, doesn't even make you pay more for eel sauce.  Minus a star.  The service was okay, not anything to brag about, but not anything to complain about.  Neither add nor lose a star.  Now the most important detail about any place to me is the drinks. And I loved their drinks! I had a black raspberry lemondrop martini or something and it was delicious. I had their cold sake sampler - also delicious and tried my dates drinks as well.   This place knows their alcohol.  Add a star.  I'll be coming back, if only for the drinks.

I've never had such a good customer service experience before!   My friend and I like to try a new place every Tuesday. Originally we went to Chop Shop but were not feeling the"healthy" selections (I wanted meat ). So we walked down to San Tan Brewery.   I ordered a burger medium well. And my friend ordered wings.  When my burger came out it was pink. A medium rare. I didn't want to say anything but when our waitress, Nicole, came to check on us, she noticed how pink it was and said that's not how I ordered it. She took it back and while they cooked me another one she gave me fries to munch on! Like, she knew I was hungry and gave me some fries! Its the little things that count you know?  And then, as i'm happily munching away on my fries this Brian guy (I think he's a manager) came and apologized about my pink burger. He went so far as to comp my burger and our first round of drinks! Like seriously.  I. Can't.  Even.  I'll be back. And I'll tell my friends. And Facebook. My mom. My priest. That weird coworker of mine that spends too much time in the bathroom... I'll tell them all how amazing my experience was at San Tan Brewery.

Really this place is amazing. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the service.  Went there for Happy Hour, and their Happy Hour drinks are amazing. I had Turning Japanese...I lost count after my first couple of those. The Happy Hour food is also a really good deal and tastes amazing! This doesn't taste like Happy Hour sushi, it's just good sushi.   The only issue I had was the service. The hostess who sat us didn't know if it was Happy Hour or not, and deflected a lot of initial questions to the waitress. Don't plan on asking your hostess too many questions, apparently they can only process whether or not you want to sit inside or outside.  Our waitress sucked. I mean, she didn't smile, didn't check up on is, didn't ask if we wanted dessert, didn't refill our water. Whattahfail.  But whatever, as long as she brought me my drinks promptly, I was happy.  The atmosphere was really fun and laid back, so this is definitely a place I see myself going in the future.

I like this home depot. I've been going here for years. The people are so nice and friendly.  I was there trying to install a dog door and had to make a couple trips back and forth for resizing purposes after find out my wall didn't support the super extra large dog door I bought. I come back with a mess of packaging and doors and screws and the guy welcomes me with a smile and asks if I would like my money back cash or credit.  Now, that's good service.  Also, I feel like as a woman (in a skirt), the people at Lowe's kinda underestimate me, or think I only go there for the painting section. Home Depot peeps are always wondering about my next big project when I stroll in here.  So I adore Home Depot.  I'm subtracting a star because I've been misled by the greeter quite a few times on which aisle I should be heading to.

This place had potential. Who doesn't like burgers, especially build your own burgers?!   So I start this place at a full five stars.   But it fell flat for me.   First of all, this place is literally in like the middle of nowhere. 35-40 minutes from Chandler without traffic. So that was lame. But anyways! I ordered a Build-My-Own burger and asked for it medium and it was cooked well done and wasn't juicy at all. Which sucks cuz I want meat! Nice juicy man meat! Not hard charred burnt meat.   But I digress, I had a burned up piece of meat with some nice mushrooms and onions but due to the burned meat and the overall lacklusterness of the burger, I shall subtract a star.  Four stars so far.   However! The sweet potato fries with Herb Sauce was delish! I wish I had a whole plate of that instead. So I shall add a star.  Five stars now.  I also can't go without mentioning a drink. I had here signature Blu-Martinin. Which was indigestable. It was so nasty and strong and just awful. I told the waitress about it and she just offered to put ice cubes in it??? That did nothing but add ice cubes. Minus a star.  Four stars.  Ambiance was...interesting. The place was small and it was cold, and dark. Very  vampire-esque. And if you're a lady don't even try to walk to the bathroom by yourself. It's like walking down rape alley - there are no lights anywhere! Also the place like doubled as a gelato shop. So it's just odd going for a gourmet American burger and then being slapped in the face with an enormous selection of Gelato. I believe Hubert Keller would scoff. Minus a star.  Three stars.  Would I go back? Hell no. The drive isn't worth the sub par food. It's just a small little shop with mediocre food and bad drinks. So I'll opt out. And just because I left feeling so disappointed I'm dropping a star.  Overall - 2 stars.

Honestly, the service sucks here.   It does. They seat you, get your order, and hand you a check.  However, I cannot pass up their frozen hot chocolate. It's perfect. Especially after a day of walking in the sun and shopping.   So I'll take my check and my frozen hot chocolate, and I'm happy.

Now I'm not a cigar connoisseur, but I thought this place was legit.  So you go there, and then there's a cigar specialist. You tell him what you like (which I had no idea), and he'll show you some cigars. You like the taste of old people tobacco - there's a cigar for that. You like the taste of bubblegum and vanilla - there's a cigar for that. You like the taste of man - there's a cigar for that.   Any place that can completely personalize an experience like that will always be a-ok in my book.

This place is just fun.  I love that it's in Chandler too. I didn't experience the actual "sand" as we sat in the back but this place was great. We tried all the margaritas and I was really happy because they don't skimp on the amount of drink and just cover it up with a bunch of ice. We also had some dip when the munchies started kicking in and it was delicious (but I was slightly drunk so I may have eaten anything and loved it). The waiters and waitresses are a little odd, but super nice and seemed genuine.  This is definitely going to be one of my new hangouts.

I first want to say that when I went, I didn't just stand in a corner by myself and gripe about all the pretty girls and act all mad and insecure. I danced, I drank. I got invited to V.I.P. So I had a full experience.  So why the two stars?  We were approached by a guy on the street who said if we were on his list, we'd get in fast and have an open bar for the rest of the night. So we show up before ten and call the guy and he walks us to this long line, and after waiting for like 30 minutes we're handed 2 drink vouchers which is apparently only good for cheap vodka and cranberry or orange juice. Come on man!!! That is not open bar! We could've gone to Tao and got a better deal!!!   And from 11-12:30 the music sucked!!! It was so bad and there was no Pauly D like promised... So mad. Needless to say we left around 1 and went to Fat Tuesday.  What I did like: the dress club and atmosphere. This was a hip club with hot people. However, it was ridiculously over crowded. If there's no room to dance, it shouldn't be called a dance club.  Learned our lesson and will never come back.

So this show has been running for 28 years and unfortunately it feels like it.   The queens I saw tonight, with the exception of the Cher impersonator, looked old and moved like they were lacking energy.   Now I love drag queens. Ever since Paris is burning, I've been hooked. I have a healthy respect for queens who have been in the business for a long time. I know it's never too late to teach an old dog be tricks...   Also, the show is titled after this famous queen Frank Marino... Where the heck is he? Don't have a self titled show if your not going to show up!!!  There was so much potential especially with the music choices. But when the Lady gaga impersonator did just dance, that queen just sat there! The song said "just dance"! You better dance! I was doing more dancing sitting in my seat than the guy did in the whole performance!  Now the Brian person who hosted the show was hilarious. Every one of his jokes were funny and delivered perfectly. However he was one of the only highlights of the show.  I was disappointed. I'll have to definitely check out somewhere else if I want to so l see drag queens in Vegas.

Apple monkey breadddd. Pretzels and cheese. pub burger. mac burger.  Oh my god I love this place.  It may be weird how often I go.  However, if you are in the Phoenix Metro Area - it is a must.   Although I rave about the food, the atmosphere is what drew me in. It's amazing! There's chandeliers and exuberant chairs, but then our napkins are dishtowels and common dress is jeans and flip flops. The whole place is an oxymoron. I adore it.  Oh and the service is amazing too. (FYI)

So the first time we tried come here, the line was out the door and down the stairs. An hour wait they said.... Nope.  So we came later around 7 pm and there were maybe 3 other patrons. Which was great because we were on our way to a Vegas show after and we couldn't wait long.  Anyways I ordered a mojito, fried green tomatoes and we split the Chicken and Waffles.  The waiter was enthusiastic and I really liked him. I told him I didn't really enjoy the mojito and he was really cool about it.   The fried green tomatoes were really beautifully delivered. They rate great too. But if I had a particular critique I'd say the batter the tomatoes in were flavorless and it kinda brought down the dish.  The wait to get my main entree was insane. Especially since there were only 3 other customers. I mean how long does it take to throw some chicken in a skillet and put some waffles in a waffle maker? Not 45 minutes.  But honestly the wait was worth it. Those sage chicken and waffles were amazing. Really.. Really... Amazing.  So yeah. I'll come back and I'll bring patience with me.

I had a 1pm appointment and it took 30 minutes for them to call me back. Which is ridiculous since they told me to drink a gallon of water before my appointment. The least you can do is make sure you're on time when you ask a patient to do that.  Next rant- if your about to give me an internal ultra sound work on your bedside manner! No one wants someone poking around their hoohah by a creepy and awkward ultra sound tech!   What a horrible experience.

I actually really liked this show!  I showed up at the box office to pick up tickets for another show, and the lady offered us tickets for $15 because it wasn't full.   We ended up getting pretty amazing seats and I was just completely entertained throughout the whole show.  It also helped that the Recycled Percussion guys were easy on the eyes.   The way they played those drums...  I very much enjoyed the show.

Absolutely love Yolis Cafe. It's the only place I will actually wake up for to go to breakfast. Every single waiter/waitress I've encountered there is beyond nice and warm and welcoming.   Biscuits and gravy are the way to go. Get a mimosa from The Perch next door, and you've reached a special part of breakfast heaven that can only be found in the little nook of downtown Chandler.   Love love love this place.

I actually really liked this place.    My friend and I shared a 36 Oz white gummy fishbowl drink.  I really liked it.  A lot of the previous reviews say not to waste too much time or money here but if you think about it is $1=1 oz.  A lot of these martinis in Vegas are like $7 for 6-8 ounces of alcohol, plus ice so it's a good deal.  I also read that they can't taste the alcohol.  Which is bull. I definitely tasted the alcohol - on the first sip.   I rambled about the alcohol because... well... Vegas.  But the foods good too!   Club sandwich had 3 slices of bread, which is a bit excessive in my opinion, but once I removed it I liked the sandwich.  The service is nothing to brag about but it's not BAD.

Coming to Dutch brothers is now part of my daily commute. Every time I come in I get a compliment. "Nice glasses", :nice phone case", "I love your make-up", "where'd you get your tattoo done", "wanna touch my man-bun?"   Who wouldn't like starting their day off with compliments from very attractive people.  Oh the tea is good too.

I came in sober and I left drunk. Isn't that what a sports bar is all about?  Honestly I thought this was a great little neighborhood bar. Everything was clean, the service was on point and the drinks were well made. Karaoke started happening sometime during the night which is a great drunken activity. I had a lot of shots. I lot of good shots, mixed shots, yummy shots. Did I mention that I left drunk?  The only bad part of the evening was the food. Drunk me wants chocolate, and the chocolate they had was in the form of a cold and stale chocolate brownie. Sober me knows better than to order dessert from a sports bar - drunk me is not so smart.  Overall I like Tukee's! I'll definitely be back.

I loved Postinos!   My friend Lauren was here last night and dragged me here today. She was so giddy with excitement and kept chanting "Postino, Postino, Postino!" It was kinda annoying actually. I was kind of off put because of the limited menu so I just let her order for me.   Just say yes to Bruscetta. We had all the Bruscetta options. Apples and brie, artichoke spread, pesto and salmon - each bite was better than the last.  It's the kind of food that makes you wonder when you can have it again...and would it be weird to order another order of everything I just ate to go? But then again, I didn't want to seem like a fatty...So the problem was: do I want to be seen as a fatty or do I want to have amazing Bruscetta at home? The struggle was real.   Last note: I must advise whoever owns this place to PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE invest a bug zapper. The patio is beautiful, the food is beautiful, the experience is kinda off put when we have killer flies attacking us from all angles trying to suck our blood and eat our Bruscetta.  That's all.   Postino postino postino!

This place is the reason Yelp was invented.  I never loved this place. I just needed a cheap gym membership. There were little things that irked me. The gym is clean for the most part, but the staff is pretty awful. Every time I went there the guy was in the bathroom "supposedly" cleaning, instead he was texting. An hour later, after I worked out, I walk in the bathroom to change and he was still texting - and the bathroom was still dirty!!!! This happened at least twice.  Even so, this place wasn't too bad. Things got bad when trying to cancel.  Granted, the staff was not the reason I wanted to cancel, I honestly just wanted a gym that was 24 hours since I work the evening shift. I read a review on Yelp when I first joined saying how ridiculous this place was to cancel. I asked the lady when registering what the cancellation policy was. 30 days notice, $10 cancellation fee. There was nothing mentioned about $40 for this, $30 for that, money, money, MONEY!  Bro, ain't nobody got time for that.   So keep away! Everything might seem mediocre a first, but things will get bad...real bad.

The food was good, but the drinks sucked. (I just turned 21, all I think about are the drinks) The decor was fun and interesting but the overall atmosphere was really loud being right next to the casino. I think they were going for a roudy-pub atmosphere, but it was more forced than anything else.   I really wanted to like this place because Gordon Ramsay is awesome, but I just...didn't.  Weird note: The outfits for the waiters and waitresses were interesting, however they only worked if the waiter was in shape. The outfits for the men who were overweight was really unflattering.

First impression: this place must be good, there's already a line and is not even open!  Atmosphere: Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.   And we had an iPad that showed us descriptions of our drinks... That was really cool. Which leads me to my favorite part of any restaurant establishment...  Alcohol: Best drinks in Vegas. Nuff said.  Food: We ordered burgers. Duh.  And they were good. We got the blue cheese burger and the chanterelle burger with truffle fries. I mean after eating at Guy Fieri's restaurant with his Mac and Cheese burger full of cheese love and gooey goodness, I appreciated the simplicity of Ramsey's  burger.  Although next time I've got to order that pork burger.  Service: Our waitress wasn't bad, but she wasn't amazing. She did her job and really there's nothing to complain about.  I will definitely be back.

I'm just gonna have to stop and call this place out.  First, I typically love $2 tacos. I'm all about that. But this place is scum.  We waited in line for 20 minutes. Not because the guy was helping another customer...no he was replacing cheese that didn't need to be replaced. It was like half full. Second,  after he replaced the cheese he stuck some in his mouth and started eating it with his gloved hands. After the cheese he decided the ketchup bottles needed replacing too. All the while me and everyone behind me are watching this guy and getting more and more pissed.  After we called him out on that to change his gloves after sticking it in his mouth he decided to be a jerk and stick the hottest salsa they have on our tacos. I asked for mild, not suicide hot. Couldn't even eat my damn taco.  I am so pissed.

For an airport restaurant, this was amazing.  We ordered:  Mac and Cheese Asiago Bread Margarita VIVA cocktail Sangria  The food was to die for! The Mac and Chesse was out of this world. Probably the best I've ever had. The Asiago bread was also amazing! It was so full of flavor, but the one thing I must say about the bread is that it's a bit messy. Also, the bread is very filling, make sure to have others to share it with.  The drinks were okay. The VIVA cocktail was very sweet (and I love sweet)! Very overwhelming for taste buds. The margarita was very good, just make sure to specify which kind of tequila you want. The sangria is one for sangria lovers. It grew on me, but first sip was kind of atrocious.   The service was really good. My waiter was extremely knowledgeable, and very kind.   I will definitely come back here when I have to stay at the Phoenix Airport for any length of time.

Ugh  If I can give this place zero stars I would.  First, the name of this business page should be AutoNation Toyota Scion of Tempe. I add the "Toyota" in there because I expected better from a Toyota dealership. I love Toyotas, I loved all the Toyotas that I've had in my life and I am a loyal customer. But this Toyota Scion of Tempe was awful.  The general manager greeted us in his little golf cart when we first got there and walked us up to a salesman and offered us water bottles. Great start. Maybe if he had stayed with us the whole time this would have been a much different review.   However the salesman he introduced us to was ghastly. He wanted to have us fill out a credit app after the very first car we saw and when we declined jumping the gun so soon without seeing other models, he got angry! Like not verbally, but you can tell in the way curt way he was talking to us and not putting any effort into finding anymore cars for us. He said goodbye to us before we were even done looking! He even lied about his name after he saw me check in on Yelp (as if I didn't already swipe his business card from his desk)!  I've been to AutoNation Toyota Scion before, and had a bad experience but I have never been treated so rude before. I sure as hell am not going to pay for a $30,000+ car here after this.  Ken, you single-handedly ruined my car buying experience.

I adore Fired Pie. Seriously so good. I love that I can call in an order for like 13 of my coworkers and say I need it at exactly 5:03 pm and they're waiting for me with smiles on their faces and food in their hands.   And the pizza. The Pizza! So freaking good. The pesto. The steak and blue. And all for like $8. It's a steal.   Since I work across the street I've come several times and I've had consistently good service.   Definitely recommend to friends and family.

I really liked this place.  I went there after a night of drinking on Mill and you could tell the workers were down for about anything (especially after I asked the *male* cashier to flash me some titty for beads). Even after that exciting introduction he was super pleasant and accommodating of my paleo sensibilities (no bread, cheese, anything processed or fried).  And the food was good!   Nothing beats good food and good service.  I will definitely be back.

I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed my experience here.  I'm never typically a fan of airport restaurants. The food is usually overpriced and average. And although I felt the food was still overpriced it was still good.   Another plus, usually bars that are known for beers typically suck at cocktails. And I hate beer... So I was thrown off that when I ordered a margarita it tasted good. Like really good. So good I ordered another one. And stopped after the second one because I kept gigglingb when the Canadian next to me said "aboot".  Good enough for me.

I love Thai food! Ever since my favorite place in Chandler closed down I've been going around looking for a new replacement. Mr. Thai Bistro is it. The food is simply amazing and it's owned by a little woman her husband so they're nice and they remember me (probably because I've been there a gazillion times since it's opened).   The prices are ridiculously cheap. A lunch entree is like 6 bucks and it comes with a free drink. It's also a hefty portion - you either share it with someone or suffer a food baby later.  Why 4 and not 5 stars? They never answer the telephone! (GAHHH I want some food, answer the phone!) They also pack the food weirdly - every time I get a to-go order the cartons are broken somewhere and I've had lots of messy stains from it in my car...besides that it's mucho bueno ( i hope that means very good in Thai...)

The sign doesn't exactly draw you in. You think there's a drive through, but instead there's a broken menu and a pile of chopped wood. The menu is sort of amateurish, and not exactly easy to gleam what else they have besides burgers...BUT the food is amazing.   I had no idea where to start here so I just asked the lady behind the counter. She said burritos are the most popular here. So I got a burrito. Very "chipotle" style where they have the meats, salsas, cheese, and other various toppings to choose from and they put it together and you're good to go. This burrito is better than Chipotle.   I'm actually sad I ventured into this place. It's too close to my place therefore it's too tempting to keep away and I'll get fat by coming here way too much.

Oh no!  This is not World of Beer Tempe at all! The waitress was kind of awful.  First, I must say, I am not a fan of beer that much. I lived in Ireland (the beer capital of my life) and managed to have a beer only once. Needless to say, beer and I do not mesh very well. However, I love World of Beer because of all the different varieties and you can literally find something for anyone.  So I bring my visiting friends to World of Beer Gilbert. I'm excited to introduce them to this crazy fun little place. But if you go to World of Beer for the first time, it can kind of be overwhelming. That's why the waitress/waiter usually eases you through it - I mean they go to be classes, they're trained in beer...stuff, like, they should know how to help someone find a good beer.  All our waitress said is that the menu is good at describing the different beers and let her know if we have a question. Then she disappears. She doesn't come back until we flag her down after waiting 20 minutes to place our order.  The beer was good. The service was not.  In fact, I was embarrassed that I talked this place up so much and that's what was delivered.  World of Beer - I still have a place in my heart for you, but I highly doubt I'll be returning to this Gilbert location anytime soon.

Soi loved this place.  So I went to Purple Zebra and got a giant frozen drink that Vegas is known for. However my mom was hungry. After a nice host outside said it was cool to bring in my extra alcohol we were seated.   I have to say the margarita, for being at a Mexican restaurant, was a major fail. It was just bad. Even though the waiter was really nice about taking it back and replacing it with a different margarita. The second margarita was bad too. So just avoid margaritas.  But everything else was amazing.  You know how you can eat something and taste love? Well the carnitas tacos I had tasted like love. Just ooey gooey flavorful love. And the guacamole with pomegranate seeds.. #idied So. Freaking. Good. I also had rice. Green rice. That kinda looked like throw up. But if you close your eyes and open your mouth you'll be taken on a journey. A journey into epic rice land full of love and yumminess.  Just yeah... Go there.

Freshly opened on Mill Ave and I'm a fan!   The food is perfect chowing down after a night of drinking and debauchery. The waitress we had was super nice, and the security guard didn't kick me out after drunkenly threatening to chop off his penis.  As with all Zipps in general i believe their Zipperatas should have the option of being frozen or on the rocks.

So I definitely checked yelp and everyone is like order the Mac and Cheese burger. I don't typicality like Mac and Cheese on a burger thanks to the Cheese cake factory, but I went ahead and tried it. And I gotta say it was pretty good. Full of flavor and grease and fat - everything you want in a burger. It would definitely be perfect after a night a drinking and debauchery.  I would eat this burger again.  But the drinks... Were not that amazing. Especially for $12 and whatever you do, do not get the cilantro cucumber mess. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck.  Last, and most important is the service. These waitresses were so nice. They were personable and helpful and attentive. I would definitely come back and definitely recommend this place to others.

I came here to escape this creepy guy with a goatee at Bourbon Jacks and I stayed for the good music and Smithwick's.  Seriously, the band playing was amazing. There was this one guy with long luscious hair that looked like he was having intimate relations with his guitar. It brought a tear to my eye.

The food isn't amazing. The prices are ridiculous (I will never pay $3 for a red bull) but the service is amazing and it's convenient.  I work in the building next door and the owner knows my name. He knows I'm always in a rush and they deliver as needed. My only complaint would be that they close at 3...which is too early. But I treasure my San Tan cafe.

Keepin it simple.  Burgers were great. Absolutely great. And if I rated just on burgers, I'd give this place five stars. But I dont.  I was really bummed they didn't have the cheese ale fries - which I heard was fantastic. Who runs out of cheese at a burger place?!?  Service was odd. They were friendly...however having six different people come up to you every five minutes with your mouth full of burger was slightly excessive. It passed the point of being attentive to the point where it seemed they were rushing us out...even though there were only two other groups of people there.   Little pet peeve of mine - employees with cellphones will always create a negative experience for me.  Moving on...ketchup bar!  Toasted Marshmallow - disgusting.  It was a cross between vanilla yogurt and icing. Think and runny.  Ragin Cajun - nice with a little kick!  Thai Ketchup - it was good! Maybe could use a bit more spice.  Chipotle Mayo - It's no Copper Blue's,  but it's pretty good.  In conclusion,  I must admit I like this new little burger place. But perhaps I'll do To-Go next time.

The theory behind orange theory is that you burn more fat if you work out in an "orange" zone. It goes: grey, green, orange, and red. Grey is resting, green is comfortable working out, orange is pushing it, and red is craziness. They give you a heart rate monitor so you can see exactly what level you are at every minute of the workout on large screens throughout the gym. Nobody needs to tell you to go harder or push more, because you can look up and see that you need to go harder or faster. It's fascinating.   At first, I thought I was dying when I started out. Well, I still think I'm dying. But I keep coming back for more. I definitely recommend it to everyone I know. It's fun to physically see your progress and know 100% how you did at the end of each class.  I've only really interacted with the trainer Sunny, but I've heard the rest of the Gilbert trainers are fun. I adore Sunny though.  One thing I should mention! They have cancellation fees. If you don't cancel or reschedule your class within 12 hours, you'll have to pay a fee. I personally like that, because it makes you more accountable, but I can see that some people would have issues with it.

We eagerly anticipated the opening of Barrio Queen. Barrio Cafe in downtown Phoenix has been a favorite for year, with the only downside being the 35 minute drive to Phoenix. Barrio Queen opening in Gilbert is only a short 10 minute drive from my Chandler residence.   Compared to Barrio Cafe: Queso Fundido: Too much mushroom, not enough chorizo. Definitely not as thick and creamy as the Barrio Cafe Queso Fundido. Barrio Cafe wins.  Margaritas: So on par. Compared to the Barrio Bomba, the Queens cooler is very equal. HOWEVER steer clear if you do not like coconut. The taste of coconut is very overwhelming. The Casa  (house margarita) was standard. Just a good margarita no complaints. The options for fruitier margaritas were non existent. So  Barrio wins.  Entrée: I had the The Queen Enchilada with chicken and my friend had the Carne Asada Torta. The Torta was really good. Had a lot of meat, it had cheese, avocado, peppers, onions - it was really good. For $12 it was a really good portion for the amount of food. The enchiladas were really good - except for the spinach. I hate spinach and this did not make me a fan of spinach. I have to say the food at Barrio is equal to Barrio cafe.  Other stuff: Waitress, Norma, was decent. Decorations were great. Artwork was fabulous. It was a very chill and comfy atmosphere.   Overall, Barrio Cafe is better, however I am excited to come here again.

Such a fantastic addition to the San Tan Mall! Absolutely delicious boba tea with a plethora of options! This is perfect for Arizona weather and an outside mall. The prices are a little cheeky but the service is nice, and they are pretty fast and absolutely delicious! Will definitely be coming back.

Besides sushi, I've never had crab before. I had NO idea what to expect when I walked in this place. As I took a look around I saw a bunch of people wearing bibs, licking their fingers, and slurping crab juices. I was kind of disgusted to be honest, and it was a little too late for me to back out since I was meeting a friend there.  The first thing the waitress did was cover my table in construction paper and tie a bib around me. I'm a classy lady, and this went way beyond my sensibilities. As each moment passed, I became more and more skeptical of this place and had very little interest in ordering anything. My dinner mate did not have the same feelings and ordered half the menu. Three different types of crabs, oysters, shrimp, bread, and fries. It was all delivered in plastic baggies and accompanied with a giant tin bin.  My dining mate cut my first crab leg and gave me a piece and as soon as I had my first bite of Angry Crab crab meat I was in love. It was a burst of flavor in my mouth. I didn't want to wait for someone to cut the crab meat open for me so I grabbed the crab and started tearing and ripping. I needed more crab meat. I did the same with the shrimp, and I slurped the oysters. I had sauce on my face and I was licking my fingers.   I left feeling dirty and smelling fishy but it was THE BEST FOOD that I've had in a long time. Enjoyed the food tremendously and loved the experience.

I woke up in the middle of the night craving rocky road ice cream. Honest to goodness, it was 2 am. and i wanted almonds dipped in chocolate swirled with marshmallows. Three hours later I'm at work and I'm craving rocky road ice cream like a pregnant lady craves ice chips. My coworkers, sick of my distraction, decided to take me for ice cream. I walk into Petersen's and almost cry in relief - I'm so close to my rocky road dream!!! I look to the right - no rocky road, I look to the left - also no rocky road. Clearly there must be a mistake, but one look at the stricken faces of my coworkers confirm my fear and my heart sinks in my chest. There is no rocky road at Petersen's.   Depressed I slunk into a chair to wait while my coworkers order various frozen delights when this little teenager behind the counter plops down a depressing looking hot fudge sundae for me. There's no rocky road ice cream, half melted whipped cream and a plump red cherry. I swirled my spoon around and unconsciously take a bite while thinking about my rocky road and I freeze (pun intended). I was in such a state of shock I completely blacked out. I come back to my senses, and look down at the table and there was no more ice cream. No more thoughts of rocky road. There was just me, in a happy sugary cold bliss.   My review: This was the best ice cream I've had in Arizona.

This place is kinda hidden but it's a great option for some healthy smoothies.  They have a ton of options: Coconut milk, almond milk, rice powder, chia seeds - everything people keep telling us to eat but we don't. I had a raspberry strawberry chia seed concoction with coconut milk and agave. It was pretty good.  I did think $6+ for a smoothie was kinda expensive but when you think about all of the ingredients they use it makes sense for the price.   So if you want a smoothie place to try out this place is better than all the sugary nonsense from Jamba Juice and has more options than whole foods.

Although my cooking specialty is scrambled eggs or a bowl of cereal, the thought of building my own pizza is extremely nerve wrecking to me. Somehow, somewhere I threw a whole bunch random ingredients on a pizza and it tasted like the best pizza I've ever had. Okay. I'm being dramatic. But this pizza was so on point. Almost better than fired pie.

It was UFC fight night and I needed an somewhere close to home to watch Ronda get her butt kicked. I heard this place had wings, and beer, and television - sounded perfect...right?  Maybe I didn't come on the right night.   There was a birthday party happening and all the waiters and waitresses seemed to be catering towards that so service was kinda slow...We were 3 fights in before our waitress greeted us...about 45 minutes? By then my friend had already walked up to the bar and ordered directly from the bartender.  We ordered wings, and as soon as they were delivered I knew I would be donating them to a homeless person. I'm going to do a comparison to Zipps right now, because Zipps knows how to do bar food. When you order wings from Zipps, it's around 6-10 big plump wings that has a smell that entices everyone in the area to order more wings. The wings here were about 25 skinny little wings with no flavor and dry as who knows what. And the smell...The lady from the table next to us scrunched up her face and asked "is that your wings?" They smelled awful and the odor was strong. I tried to hold onto those wings until UFC 193 was over to deliver to a homeless person but the smell from them was so strong I was advised several times to just throw them away.   I really hate to write such a bad review, so now I'll mention some positives - the televisions were great, the beer was good, and the prices were affordable. This place is so close to where I live and has some great potential to be a fantastical local bar, it just needs some help with the food.

I absolutely loved Jackie's cafe. It's really cute. The owner and her son are the only people that work there and they are super genuine people.  The food is awesome too! I had an egg salad sandwich on a croissant and a crumbly cherry dessert. Really buttery and yummy. I ordered more egg salad sandwich and I took some home for later because it was SO good!   There's just something about this place that you just want to see it exceed. I know I loved coming here, I hope others enjoy it as well.
