This was not a good experience. The Polish and my nails shape work cute on my pedicure. However I received no menu of services and was not able to pick what I wanted for my pedicure. I came in and asked for a manicure and pedicure and they just gave me whatever pedicure they wanted to give me. I walked out with my feet still not smooth on the bottom and would have liked to have callus remover and even a paraffin dip. However I will know for next time and we'll not I repeat NOT be returning here!

Rebekah is so professional and simple to work with! She put everything in layman's terms and made me feel like she really cared about my family.  I highly recommend her!
