This location is larger than most. The check in guy in the morning is really friendly. Club culture here is hit or miss... mostly miss. People don't use towels in the free weight or on the machines. The guys here also don't re-rack the weights.  They can grunt and sling weights but can't put them back.  Lots of TVs.... Most set to sports or news but sometimes on some crappy gossip channel.    Bathrooms cleanliness leave something to be desired. Same with showers and locker rooms. Need to do a thorough cleaning and some repairs.  They did add new machines about two months ago.    Overall, it's closest location to my work so that is why I go here. There are better cleaner LAs out there.

Used this location for my Wedding Tux rental.  There are 11 total rentals for my upcoming wedding - Me, Best Man, 5 Groomsmen, 2 Dads (biological and step), and 2 ring bearers (twin boys).  They got me in, and out in about 30 minutes for the initial meeting.  They explained all the options, pricing, etc.  Very professional.  The "kid" (probably 22) didn't provide much assistance or recommendations...but the other staffers that assisted me did.  This part of the review I would give 4 stars - slightly better than average service/etc.  1 star deducted because I HAVE to pick up the tux 2 days before the wedding and not the day before.  Popped in there this past weekend for the fitting/measurements - was in and out in 5 minutes!  But then I decided to browse (bc using the voucher towards a new suit vs the free tux).  Emmett H. - was there to assist me. I didn't think I needed assistance (bought many suits in my life) - but Emmett was great.  He has a calm professional demeanor about him.  He was very knowledgeable about all the suits and the origins, fabric, stitching, etc.  Very very helpful.  He then helped me look at this fantastic suit - Italian made, imported wool, German stitching style - Top Notch.  I can't wait to pick it up.  Emmett said he has 2 (I believe) FT Tailors on-hand and can have the alterations done relatively quickly (permitting demand).  I think Emmett is my new Suit-Guy in AZ!  Overall - 4.5 stars.  Emmett gets 5, the store 4, so overall 4.5.

Love love love BR mint chocolate chip ice-cream!  The girl working today was the nicest girl ever. Super friendly and upbeat. She offered us a few taste samples.  We sampled the "Flavor of the Month", the sorbet mix, and the mocha-java.  Definitely made our experience even better.  Nothing better than ice-cream when it's 110 outside - no exaggeration.  If you are heading south on Power - You can enter this location by turning left at the light and make a quick right cutting through the gas station.  Easier than doing a U-Turn on this busy road.

It's an Outback - but what makes THIS Outback better are the bartenders.  The guy and gal team that is here makes the place.  He is on his A-Game - slinging drinks, sarcasm, and all-out fun all night long.  Think his name is Chris.    Went for HH - definitely a good deal.  Stayed and had the Petite Filet combo with potato and Shrimp-on-da-Barbie (love it).  Cooked perfectly - portioned well so I won't have a gut-ache from eating too much.  Will definitely be back - but again preferred if the bartending duo is working.

I have to admit - when I first moved to AZ I was skeptical on this place.  The "Wife" loved it immediately - so of course that means we order it often.  Each time - Barros got our order right and loaded with chewy tasty cheese, right amount of sauce, and meaty meats.  I would normally only have given it 3 or 4 stars, however after ordering from other pizza places in the area and having their so-so pizza, Barros has won me over during the past 9 months.  This location has recently done a complete remodel - to the usual "Barros" model of the dark woods and new pleather/leather booths and tables.  The Kids section is expected to be completed shortly.

Seriously - 2 stars for Rosatis? IF you are not from Chicago, you may not LOVE this place, BUT 2 stars and to say that frozen pizza is better?  Please do us all a favor and take your mug outside and smack it with your left hand.  I went here this past weekend, ordered 4 extra-large pizzas with various toppings (Saus/Pepp; Saus/Shroom; Saus/Pepp/Ham/Bacon).  All were coooked perfectly and were prepared as ordered.  My order was ready in exactly 25 minutes as was quoted on the phone.  Also, I had a coupon for Rosatis and they accepted it with no questions.  You can't go wrong with the stuffed or thin - but I usually opt for thin crust, sasuage, pepperoni and sometimes extra cheese.  Rosati's pizza, Pepsi (or Captn/Coke), and PS3 or Netflix and my Friday night is complete!

OMG - so the other reviewers were right - I got a whole basket of fruit for less than $6.  I couldn't believe it.    Strawberries - 2 for $1 Kiwi - 4 for $1 Apples - 2 lbs for $1 Grapes - 2lbs for $1 Bananas - 2lbs for $1  Definitely on my once or twice a week store to hit for fruit/vegetables.  Need to spend $5 or more to use electronic pay (i.e. CC/Debit).

This is a very nice library - unfortunately since it isn't open on Sundays, I have to give 4 stars instead of 5.  The staff here is very friendly and efficient.    Parking is a plus since it is covered (by solar panels) and they have a 24hr drop-box.    I signed up for my receipts to be emailed to me and I also get friendly email reminders for upcoming return dates (4 days in advance).  You can renew online as well as pay fines online.  They are open until 8p during the week, til 5p on Sat, closed Sundays.

These guys are top notch. Bring the wife's Acura MDX here for oil changes and other regular maintenance items and bring my old Ford here for routine maintenance and anytime it needs some major attention (usually every 2 yrs, like I said, 17yo car with nearly 200k miles).   Sandy n Sons (SnS) are honest,  on time,  and very polite.  Never had a bad experience.  They show you the parts that were replaced pointing out why it needed to be replaced.  They stand behind their work...i.e. today took the MDX in bc of a new oil leak that appeared after oil change performed last week.  Called ahead and they reserved a bay for us so they could check it out right away. Apparently the original washer wore out so they replaced it. Checked that the leak stopped,  topped off the fluids and we were on our way.  25 min in and out!  SnS is our family auto shop. They aren't open weekends,  but do allow drop offs night before service. They do everything but exhaust related repairs.

Very helpful staff - had to replace a screen filter and O-Ring for my Dad's pool pump - the staff assisted me in making sure I purchased the right parts.  Also - let me know if it didn't work out - I could return it.  This place was busy when I went this past weekend (Sunday).  3 sales staff - all assisting people.

I can honestly say that I have been to this store at least once a day (and up to 4 times in 1 day) since buying my home (and doing most of the remodeling myself and with my Dad).    The service overall is very good.  I think out of all the times that I have visited this store, there was only once or twice where the service was less-than-stellar.  All the other times - great!  Quick check-out, knowledgeable staff, and a good selection of materials/tools.  Every employee makes eye contact, says "Hi, need help finding something?"  Have yet to have 1 visit where I wasn't asked this at least once...and more often than not several.  I am very familiar with this store now so I don't usually need help finding something - more often than not I will solicit advice/guidance if I am not 100% sure on something and the staff know what I am talking about.  I ordered my cabinets through HD and they turned out beautiful (Woodmark - Portland style, Square, Cherry wood, Java Cherry finish).  Sarah assisted me with the ordering/design/etc.  She is very very knowledgeable with this aspect.  I applied (and got approved) for both the HD Card and the Home Project Loan.  The HLP is fantastic - a fixed rate, lower than a CC - with up to 7 years to pay back (although I am not planning to need that long).  I do go to Lowes too - I just happen to go to HD more.

Not sure of the negative experiences here.  Ordered my pie on-line - said it would be ready in 17 minutes....I got there with 3 minutes remaining on the clock and out of the oven it came!  Fresh and piping hot.  It was soo good too.  They made it correctly and the price was as quoted on-line.  As far as customer service, there was a lady in front of me who I swear never ordered a pizza in her life nor had she heard of Pizza Hut bc she was asking all sorts of questions about crust, ingredients, cheese, etc.  Poor guy.  The other service gal could see this lady was going to be a while so she called me to the side, got my name, my order, then cashed me out and handed me my pizza.   :)

Been a fan of this place since before Yelp! found it.  True it is not cheap.  True the time it takes to get your food is so looooong that you think they forgot about you.  BUT they didn't.  My tip - get your drink - fill it - drink it - re-fill it - repeat.  About the 2nd or 3rd refill is about the time you can expect to get your food.  I am either boring or extremely loyal depending on your POV - if I find something that I like - I stick with it.  If I don't - I either try something else or never return to that establishment.  For this place - I get the Chick-Parm with Pasta salad.  It has never let me down!  Since I live in CA - I only get to this place when I visit family - so it is a must-do when I visit.  Usually 3-4 times a year.    When I do make it here - I eat it up - then usually go home and sleep for a nice 2 hour nap. :)  Then I can return to visiting with the fam.

Fantastic place!  My brother wanted to meet here for breakfast when I was in-town visiting.  So we did.  He is a regular and after my first visit I can see why.  First the staff...  Some of the best eye-candy around serving you coffee and eggs and bakey when I wakey.  Seriously nice.  And all makes, years, and models - many of which probably are students.  Definitely good viewing pleasure while you wait for your order.  The Food...very good and the servings are pretty decent.  I couldn't finish my order (but I usually don't).  Eggs/bacon cooked to order, with sourdough toast and hash browns. pretty much have to try to screw that up.  Prices are fair...not cheap, not expensive.  The atmosphere overall was pleasant, no mess-ups on our order, they didn't rush us, and got to spend an hour or so visiting my brother while taking in the scenary and  Bull$hittng with each other.   A solid 3.5 stars.

This review is mostly for the Tram/Terminal D  I wasn't a fan of the "original" McCarran airport...you know the one I am talking about....where it feels like you are stepping back to 1974 with the retro carpet, loud slot machines, scents of cigarettes, sights of  grandmas spending their very last $8 in the slots while almost missing their flight back to reality.  I think this is the main terminal and it is still there...but thankfully via JetBlue...I don't have to spend much time in that one.  But the most recent trip landed me in the Jet Blue Terminal D - which is the new terminal.  Other than the hassle of catching a tram and waiting 15 minutes in the cab queue (which I understand the power of the Mob/Unions - but seriously this city should have made the tram run from the airport to the Strip), this airport is pretty good.  Food choices are good.  (Cinnabon, Starbucks, a pizza place, a burger place, and literally a half-dozen other places that I can't recall at this moment).  I do however recall that I would have eaten at one of them except for the fact that I was going on 12 hours sleep for this 3-Day March Madness Guy-Trip weekend) and wanted to sit in a seat facing south looking over the tarmac and watching the planes and zzzzzzzzzzzzz.  The Terminal is very clean, modern, bright, and open.  A couple of desert turtle statues, a couple of model airplanes next to the escalator  which appear to be "taking off" when heading up or "landing" when heading down the escalator (which I thought was pretty creative).  Bathrooms are clean.  Wi-Fi is great.  Security was relatively quick.

Disclosure: It is what it is.  My review is based on the fact that it is a 3 1/2 star hotel and I will only compare this hotel other 3 1/2 star hotels.  As compared to other 3 1/2 star hotels, I would rate this one near the top.  Check-in -  Stayed for 3 nights (R, F, A).  Arrived first night at 1am (F) (drove in from CA) - we had booked a King Room facing the strip on a high floor.  We got 2 full beds, facing to the West (not the Strip).  Was told that check-in starts at 3p and anytime after that the runs the risk of losing a booked room.  Even though I remained calm/relaxed, the 2 reps were not overly friendly nor apologetic - didn't even offer a free drink comp or anything like that. The next day, at 4p I went back to check-in our new room - and they corrected it - getting us a King room, high floor, facing the strip.  The rep this time was great.  I believe her name was Jennifer (late 20s~early30s).  She was courteous, made pleasant small talk while she was on hold with Hotel Ops (to release our room to us), professional, and ensured that I was taken care of or if I needed anything else.  Probably why she is working the day shift.  Room - Was nice, clean, etc.  No major blemishes/etc.  Pool -  Great pool area.  Lazy river, wave pool, hottub, regular pool, beach area.  Music playing, DJ/Host shows up ~11a offering free shots/etc.  Music is Pop/Dance.  Not as crazy as some of the other hotels but def still can get PG-13/R after 1p as the booze/sun really takes its' toll on the patrons (aka drunken debaunchery)  Bought 2 tubes ($15/$13 Lg/Sm) vs paying $10/day to rent for the lazy river.  Workout facility - was much nicer than I was expecting.  Full set of free weights as well as a machine for each Chest/Tris/Abs/Bis/Back/Legs.  About 8 treadmills, 3 spin machines, 3 or 4 tv's.    Pros - Pool (Lazy River & Wavepool), Burger at the Pub (Med Rare) - was so awesome and cooked perfectly. Cons - Strawberry daiquiri slushie - no good; Late night hotel reps.; Resort Fee

I think this is one of those tourist places to see while in Vegas center-strip.  Live music in the back, a small patio out front where people stand and watch the crowds go-by.  This place is probably enjoyed better in groups (at least I had a better time because there were 4 of us).  If you have a group of at least 4 (or 2 and you want to get buzzed quickly) then you can opt for the famous giant yard glass bong-style Margarita to be shared.  It is $50 and serves ~8 glasses of margaritas.  The margarita was good - not bad not great.  We also ordered the nachos with half chicken/half beef.  I think it was ~$16.  It is huge.  If I had to do it over again I would not order them again.  I just wasn't wowed by them.

Hand's down a fantastic show.  It has ruined me for any other show that I see because The Phantom has set the bar so high.  It completely moved (chills/tears) me and I plan to see it again.  I saw this with my fiancée and we ante'd up for the best seats (3rd row center) and it was worth every cent.

When visiting family in Mesa - I will use this dog park.  It is CLEAN!!! And it has GRASS!  Easy parking, the place is huge.  There is a place for little rat-dogs (purse dogs) and a separate area for regular size dogs.  Mesa and surrounding communities need more dog parks in general - but if they add more - this should be the template!

Prices are reasonable.  Selection is very good.    Great place for campers.  Good gun selection.  Great ammo selection. Could easily spend hours in the store and max out the CC if left unattended.  Will definitely return here.

Lucky to be receiving 1 star.  Ordered internet install via Cox on-line form.  Gave 2 preferred times - M and T afternoon.  Get an email, sorry, will be Fri from 3-5p.  WTF!  Called to reschedule, was told sorry, those are your preferred times but not times we have available.  WTF.  Seriously - why even post preferred times if they aren't available?  I told the guy that is setting Cox up for failure by allowing the customer to believe they are going to get service on 1 of their 2 choices.  If that is not the case, then they should not even allow a preferred time slot.

Honored my tire purchase service that I made in Orange County (CA).  Got my car in, tires rotated, and out within 30 minutes on a Saturday morning at 8a.  Very fast, professional, and courteous.  Good to see that the Discount Tire in Mesa is just as good as the one in Fountain Valley!

As always, fast,  polite,  and honest. Guy that looks like young thin Howie Long is usually the guy that welcomes me, checks the tires,  and mileage is always nice.  Been going to DTS for more than 12 years.  The rotation program is great because it keeps you honest about rotating the tires,  hence getting the max miles out of them.

After my last experience at a different Rosatis location - I opted to drive a little further and order from here instead.  What a difference a 10 minute drive south makes.  This location's staff was On-it!  The young gal was attentive, had my order correct, and even invited me to the store's frequent buyer stamp card and email offers including $5 off my next order!    The pizza was cooked perfectly - Large, Extra Cheese, Pep/Saus combo.  Perfect!  The family ate it all up!    This provides a conundrum for us - do we drive 10 minutes further for this location or go back to the Rosatis on Power? We will definitely make the drive and return to this location.  But we may give the Power location another shot if we are near the closing time or something like that.  If they drop the ball again - we will likely never return to that location.

Found this place via Yelp!  It is in or near the Little Saigon community in a strip mall.  The restaurant is relatively small (seats ~30-40).  I was looking for a great place for breakfast before the drive back to CA.  I got the french toast with side of eggs.  The wife got the breakfast sliders (basically a breakfast sandwich made with biscuits/gravy instead of toast/etc.).  She loved it and ate most of it.  The hash-browns were good - a little greasy/salty which was to be expected and really hit the spot after a weekend in Vegas.  The french toast was good.  Service was good, prices were reasonable.  One of my party members said the coffee was not very good and unless you need coffee, would probably opt for OJ or milk next time.  We will probably stop by again as there were a few other items on the menu that we would like to try (most notably the Monte Cristo).

Great steak house.  Prices were average for a steak house in a casino on the strip.  This review is for my party of 4 on a Saturday night.  Bar- We started with the $5 bar specials (Sky Vodka or house wine drinks at the bar).  The wife had the house red (and liked it a lot) a cabernet.  I had a sip - It was very good.  Meal- We ordered the filet (8oz) Med Rare to split which was ~$45.  The other couple ordered the Rib-eye to split (~$50) same Med Rare.  The server cautioned me that splitting the steak would not be enough for me but I wasn't worried because I don't usually eat a lot in 1 sitting - plus we ordered 3 sides ($24) (mashed potatoes, asparagus, & baked potato).  Also I wanted to save room for dessert. A word of caution - splitting would probably not be enough for most.  Steak was cooked perfect.  It was a good cut and very flavorful.  They put a mustard sauce on the steak - which I don't usually do and didn't know they did that.  Used to just having salt/pepper/butter on my steaks.  I scraped most of it off.  It was alright flavor.  Not bad, not good - just not a sauce guy when it comes to steak.  The rib-eye was very pleasing to the eye when it came out because it had a giant bone stick out of it - literally 6-9" bone - looked like a lamb shank.  The rib-eye was a very good size cut - I believe it was 20oz.  The other couple finished most of it.  It too was cooked to the correct temperature.  Dessert- We ordered 2 of the special desserts (sauteed BBQ s'mores).  It was strongly suggested by the server.  It was very good. The presentation was great.   Basically a banana cooked (wrapped in foil left in its' skin), with chocolate and marshmallow.   About 6 or so graham crackers on the side,  along with 3 small bowls of chocolate flakes, coconut flakes, & caramel ice-cream.

It's Sbarro....we all have been here.    It's pizza...it isn't true NY Thin crust nor true Chicago Deep or Pan.  But it is pretty good pizza when it's 3am, you've been drinking, and you've been losing your a$$ in the casinos and have $9 left in your pocket and you don't want to hit the ATM for another $100 withdraw and an $8 ATM fee plus whatever your bank charges you.    Avoid ordering drinks here...$3 for a drink...coke, water, whatever...it's all ~$3.  I probably sound like a cheap old man...but seriously enjoyed how I can walk here (all indoor so no need to worry about temps of 110 or 40 and rain/windy)  from either Monte or Aria, at any hour...and get a decent piece of food that will fix my craving for less than $5.  Tip: Get a drink in the casino...then stroll down to Sbarro...get a slice of "roni" then go to sleep.  Total cost...$4.85.  Score!!!

Ahhhhh......Aria.    The Good 1) New hotel with really nice beds, pillows, electric curtains/radio/lights/tv (yes...so your hungover lazy a$$ doesn't have to get out of bed to open the curtains, adjust the lights, or turn off the tv.) 2) Location - on strip attached to Monte and Cosmopolitan 3) The great looking people...seriously....now I am a happy man in a committed LT relationship...but my goodness...the women here are gorgeous/hot....the guys are good looking too...but I think there are more good looking women than men.  Even for March Madness weekend...couldn't believe how many women were present.   4) Staff - every staff member I passed always gave eye contact with a "good morning", "good evening", "hello".  Now one would think that something so simple and lame as eye contact and a "hello" is nothing big...but seriously no one  does it anymore.  People probably think I am a weirdo because I give eye-contact to a stranger and give a simple nod or "hello". 5) Lots of slots/table games to choose from.  I played the 12-man roulette machine - the one that has the real wheel/ball.  I enjoyed it because I could play $5 minimum vs the $15 minimum at the wheel that is manned.   6) Think I saw maybe a handful of kids...which is great that it was so low.  Come on parents...don't bring your kids to Vegas.  Although you may think you are a "great" parent for bringing lil Johnny or Susie.  You're not.  People go to Vegas to drink, swear, "bump uglies", gamble, or whatever.  I was with the guys and we were at the Casino..about 4 rounds deep...the language got a little vulgar as one would expect with 6 guys...and then I turn around and see 2 5 year olds...Doh!  And the parents shot me a look...I was like...hey jerk...take your kids to Chuck-E-Cheese...not Vegas!  The Bad 1) Restaurant selection and Price tiers - there is no cheap place. Period.  Cheapest place was $17 for a salad or panini and a coke.    WTF - worst part...when asked to have the "fresh" sandwiches not made with peppers or onions - the staff stated..."ohh...sorry sir, we can't do that...the sandwiches are already made." - so much for the "fresh sandwiches".  So I am like whatever Joe, your in Vegas at a "trendy" hotel...no worries...I say fine..I'll take that.  Then we wait what felt like 15 minutes for them to bring us our pre-made panini (and there was no one else in the café).  So it's not fresh, and it's pre-made - yet it takes more than 3 minutes to get your sandwich!?!  2) Cheapest table game is $15 and that is only during the day/early evening, and usually only roulette or 1 or 2 card games.  Most are $25 min.  Many are $50 min after 9pm on the weekends.  3) Club noise - we were on the 32nd floor (pretty high up there) - and yet even at 4am - I could hear the club music from below.  I know I sound old - but the night before I went to bed at 7a after an all-nighter...and wanted to get a quiet night sleep.  Slept at other hotels (3 stars) and never had noise issues - those rooms were like vaults.  Tip: Hit the food court and the Pub at Monte Carlo (not the Pub at Aria!).  Good food at great prices.  McDonalds, Sbarro, Subway, & my favorite Starbucks!

Seriously a very nice gym.  The team members are polite, the other members stick to themselves, and the premises were spotless.    Enjoy hitting this gym up when visiting the family in East Mesa.  All the free weights, nice cardio equip, clean spa/steam room/locker room.  Solid 4.5 Stars!  Wish my 24Hr gym was more like this location - new, clean, not as packed, etc.

This place gets a C+ (good thing I gave extra credit points earned with the bathroom presentation).  Pros: 1) Aesthetics - the restaurant looks great, the plate presentation looks great, even the bathrooms look great. Love the mosaic tile-job in the bathrooms.  Great color scheme overall. 2) Location - it's in the Aria...can't get any closer...and if you are staying in the Cosmo/Aria/Monte - no cab fare! 3) Learn spanish while visiting the bathroom.  Seriously...spanish 101 cd is going on while you sit/stand/wait in the bathrooms.....think....loungy music when you get up from the table...stroll 100 paces...enter bathroom...and you hear "Autumn...Autumn........Beer...Cerveza..........Money...Deniro...".  You get the point.   4) Service - Our waitress was on top-of-it.  She got our refills, bill, etc. at just the right time.  Cons: 1) Bartender needs to go.......and here's why:  I tended bar p/t for nearly 8 yrs.  I give a little credit to bartenders when they are a) "in the weeds", b) making 5 different kinds of blended/fu-fu drinks c) dinner rush. I expect a Vegas bartender in an upscale hotel restaurant to be able to take a drink order and deliver it to the party within a reasonable amount of time.  The main bartender looked as though he was so buried you'd think he was working a night club during the main 1030-11p rush.  I looked around and saw every spot at the bar was taken (it only sat ~18peeps) but we were the only peeps standing around asking for a drink.  The tables were full but not packed so he wasn't busy with the server's request.  There were 2 other bartenders working as well.   Then the servers were bringing out dishes for the patrons that were seated at the bar so he wasn't busy with that.  The bartender kept going back and forth between us, the patrons at the bar, the servers running around...you get the point.  We all ordered our 3 drinks total at the same time.  After 15 minutes...he had provided 1...a glass of wine.  We didn't order anything complicated...let's see...glass of red wine, Jeiger-RedBull (as a drink), and a Capn-Coke....nothing too crazy.  No chicky Cosmo, no fu-fu frozen pina-what-cha-ma-call-it.  3 easy drinks.  I looked at the bartender...and he was sweating it...again...not sure why.    Then my buddy says...hey buddy....can we get the Jeiger-RedBull and Capn-coke.  He is like...oh...oh yea.... no apology, no offer of a freebie or a discount.  another 10 minutes he came with our drinks.  We paid...and about 1 min later we were seated.    2) Prices.... I know to expect to pay more in a hotel, I know to expect to pay more in a Vegas hotel....and yet I know to expect to pay more in the "latest and greatest hotel in Vegas".....but come on.  Seriously.  $17 for 1 single lamb chop?  $16 for 2 mini cheeseburgers?  3) Portions are small...even for a Tapas-style restaurant.  Each person will need to order minimum of 3 dishes each.

**Updated Review- Based on my last experience - the service here is so-so at best.  The "kids" behind the counter are unattentive.  I had to literally shout to get them to notice that they had a guest in the lobby.  If it weren't for the fact that this location is at the bottom of the hill of Las Sendas - I probably would not return and instead opt for a different location.  Store Manager/Owner - This is YOUR opportunity to make this right.  I am pretty generous/fair on my reviews and this location is by-far the weakest of all in the Mesa Valley.  **********  It's Rosatis.  True nothing will ever taste as good as Pizza (incl. Rosatis) that you actually get IN Chicago because of the water quality west of the Mississippi is fair at best, this Rosatis does a really good job.  The kid that took our order was pretty cool-chill.  Brought it out to us in ~15 minutes - piping hot!  The sausage at Rosatis is awesome.  We visit this location every time we come to visit Dad/Mom since they live in the adjacent neighborhood.  Tip - order extra cheese - it is so worth it...the grease dripping all over - esp. from the pepperoni.

7a-7p. Cash or credit!  Can't really complain about a $3 wash.  The staff was pretty cool - nice kid - especially given that it was 7a on a Sat and he looked like he had woken up about 5 minutes before.  If the place isn't busy - recommend backing into the stall to do the vacuum.  Otherwise - the hose isn't very long.  If you can't back in because the place is busy - then I suggest you pull up all the way to the little curb thingy.  The machines for the extras (Armor All, towels, scent sticks, etc.) are cash only.  Overall - THE Best Value I have ever come across for a wash and vacuum.

Don't believe I have ever had a bad visit to this place.  They know the family (because they frequent here often) and so we are usually greeted by first name.  It is a nice place to relax, get a fw drinks, and eat while visiting the Family.  The steak was very good, prices were not as crazy as I was expecting - but then again it is always nice when Dad picks up the tab.

Very good barber and I am willing to drive the distance to go here (drive from E. Mesa 202/Power).  The barbers are skilled and use a straight-blade to clean up the edges.  There are tvs, and a PS3 system for when there is a line.    Usual barber banter talk about sports and "guy" stuff.  Took my lil' brother (well he is 17) here this past weekend to get rid of his "Bieber-style."  He liked the cut/style.  The barber listened to how I explained what I wanted - basically a #2 on the edges/bottom, scissor-cut top (1" off), blend the back/sides to the top - and not shave the back/sides all the way up to the top of the head.  He nailed it.

So-so for a DD.  Staff was whatever.  Selection of donuts was weak - even if it was in the early afternoon.  The price for the quality, selection, and service - disappointing.  May try this location again - but if there are different locations - will probably go to those ones instead.

After laying poolside for a few hours and out a couple of 'Jacksons', the wife and I decided to stop by here for their 2 for 1 Margaritas.  Figuring the margaritas have to be decent since they were blended, we sat down and ordered a round of strawberry margaritas.  We are thinking...cool...2 margaritas, $12 (with tip), sitting outside on a patio overlooking the Flamingo grounds...not bad right?  Wrong!  Let me tell you.  I tended bar p/t when I lived in Chicago (downtown not suburbia) so I know how to make a lot of drinks...well...including garnish (which don't get me going on most bartenders in today's bars that don't know a garnish from their a$$hole) and make them quickly.  The bartender was friendly.  Got us our drinks quickly, then dropped the bill and left.  First thing I notice...no lime....uhh..it's a margarita...anyone knows margaritas get limes.  So I wait for the bartender...for like 2 minutes.  Finally I stand up, walk over to the bar and reach over and grab 2 lime wedges from the garnish rack.  Place one lime in each of our drinks.  Cheers to a nice holiday...proceed to drink.  I downed a good sip thinking it would be good.  It wasn't...the most sour, bitter drink.  But not wanting to 1) make a scene and 2) get all worked up because we were on holiday afterall, we decide to leave and take our drinks with us thinking we would finish them given the heat and all.  Well...a couple of hotels later (as we walk along the strip) - we end up throwing them away.  What a sin...in sin-city.  The food looked decent and the prices fair - which is the only reason I am not giving the place a 1-star.    So in all honesty...probably closer to 1 1/2 stars.  Avoid the margaritas at all cost.  The Nachos looked good.

So wanted to love this bar. Went here Saturday night with the wife and a few of her friends,  specifically bc they wanted to ride the bull and listen to country music.   Be forewarned,  I am NOT happy so this review may come across a little terse.  So I ordered a Knob on rocks for the misses at the bar. Paid the bar keep including solid tip.  Walk back to table to give said drink to wife (didn't take 1 sip.)  Wife takes glass,  takes a sip,  then notices a huge dead gnat/fruit fly at bottom of glass.  Thinking nothing of it bc I bartended in my past life and see that happen more often than not,  I calmly take the drink back for a new one.  Different bartender (long hair,  tats,  super Sons of Anarchy douchey looking)  looks at me all gruffly bc I interrupted his conversation with another worker,  and asks what's up? I began to explain to him the situation,  he cuts me off halfway and says I'm not giving you a new drink (recall it's full and I'm not trying to get a free drink). I said wait,  what?  He repeats himself,  I said I'd like to speak to your manager.  He says I'm the manager on the floor.  I now asked how he isn't correcting the situation and he explains that the dead fruit fly got in there while the drink was in my possession from the time the bar keep handed me the drink to 20 steps to the table.. . Thinking some fruit fly!  Super fast skills and then dies instantly and sinks to bottom of rocks glass..... Sure,  that's it.   He then says that it couldn't possibly be the bar's fault bc they cover the bottles at night and issued me a clean glass.  Now I'm pissed.  Again,  I tended bar for 8 years, I know fruit flies are like roaches,  never gone... They hang out in the ice bin,  the spill rack,  and flutter about the bottles even if covered.  Again he said no new drink.  I said no problem,  I'll reject the charge with Visa.   So I left the full drink on the bar,  walked backed and told the ladies we are out of there. The bar lost out on an easy and attractive crew of ladies dropping coin on drinks.   BTW the bull doesn't work,  and the bar keep said it's been busted for months and likely will be removed from the premises shortly.   This place is a joke and I am by no means a vindictive person (look at my other reviews,  I always give the establishment an opportunity to fix anything that's out of place bc I'm not one of those Yelpers that uses Yelp to bash a place without given a chance to correct and save face but shame on this place,  all for a $10 drink that was their issue to correct. Avoid like the plague and looking at other reviews,  this place will likely close and a better place will move in.

Tried this facility out as a 'VIP Guest' since the wife has gym plan here.  First time at this facility.  Staff was SUPER friendly.  Place was pretty big with brand new and clean machines/facilities.    The Cycle/Spin class set-up looks awesome.  Stadium seating for the bikes - very cool.  The pool/sauna/spa/shower areas very clean.  Lockers are nice and even hair-dryers in the men's locker room - nice touch.  For a gym that is not $100/mo - think this is as good as you are going to get.  Solid 4.5 stars.  Rounded up since I did not have to go through the "tour" after explaining that I am currently with '24Hr Fitness' and my contract doesn't expire until Oct 2014 and I workout at gyms 4-6 days a week so not a "newbie."  Tip - fill out the waiver form on-line and print at home - saves you time!

3.5/5.0.  Hours need to expand. Some of the staff need to be a little more attentive.  Membership grew here recently with the expansion to allow 24 Fitness members BUT the hours have yet to be expanded to accommodate the increase in volume.  On weekends they don't open until 8a! This is not acceptable.    1) AZ folks in East Valley tend be early risers (lots of elderly) 2) In the summer most prefer to workout before the sun rises 3) There is literally a line of 20 people lined up at 750a each and every Sat and Sun morning waiting to work out.  Long story short. ...to get back to 5 stars, need to expand hours....at least 7a open on weekends. Also some of the front staff could at least acknowledge guests when you arrive/leave instead of having their head down looking at their phones.  Also, please people 1) Use a towel 2) Rerack (esp those meat heads that put 6 plates on a bar/rack 3) Don't hog multiple equipment and then get an attitude when people want to "work in" sets with you.

Brett is honest, reliable, and proficient as well as being nice and genuine.    I called Kilter for a heating issue (basically system kicked on but not hot air when it was 36degrees last night). Brett answered at a little after 8a and I briefly explained the issue and hoped that he could make it out today.  He said he could come out today and likely b/t 11-1130a.  I said great.  At about 1030a Brett gave me a courtesy call to let me know that he was on his way and would be on-time.  At about 1055a - he arrived - pleasant surprise!    He identified the issue, fixed it, and then provided me an update on what was wrong, as well as giving me a high-level assessment of the unit.  I was fortunate that it wasn't anything major.  He was at my house for less than an hour.  Brett's rate was very reasonable.  Highly recommend Kilter Mechanical Cooling & Heating.

Ordered pizza from here last night for take-out.  Girl on phone was very polite and answered all of my questions confidently.  Was told pizza would be done in 15 minutes.  Went to pick it up ~12 minutes later.  It was ready and boxed up to go.  Exactly as ordered, hot, fresh ingredients, and LOTS of cheese - so yummy.  Will order here again.  The wife really liked Barro's pizza crust/dough.

So excited... Brand spankin' new SBUX 100' from my office! Slightly larger than average size (both inside and patio).   Friendly baristas, haven't messed up my easy drinks, and quick.  There are lots of outlets and various chairs and tables so that's a plus.

SOOO UPSET because I was the first to review this place but Yelp tagged my review to the original Pho Viet Nam #1 (even though I was the one that submitted the address and new location and 1st to Review this place back on 6/8/2016)! But I digress.  5 stars based on local standards.  Tough to find any LA/OC equivalent Asian shops in Greater PHX.  So excited to have a pho place so close to home.  We have been missing legit pho since my wife and I moved here from SoCal.  Excellent local,  legit,  Vietnamese family owned Pho!  Extensive menu.  Friendly staff.  Very reasonable prices.  Vegetarian friendly.  Vietnamese iced espresso with cream and lemonade soda as well!  Had the usual pho,  rare,  with a side if filet.  Definitely opt for the side of filet for $4.50.  The broth itself is what makes pho pho.  Not too oily or greasy,  don't need to add a bunch of stuff to make it taste good.  They provide all the typical sides.  Appetizer of fried egg rolls,  perfect portion of 2 for $2.95.  Pho, 1 size,  is $6.95.  So excited to have a Pho place in the East Valley.  This is the owner's 2nd shop.  The other is in Gilbert.    Definitely will be back.

Pleasantly surprised...... About every aspect of this Elite Event!  The venue,  the host,  the food,  the booze,  the atmosphere,  and of course the company.   Looking over the reviews for this venue I was a little skeptical,  but then again I was suspicious based on the reviewers very limited review history and friend roster....IMO, anyone with fewer than 50 reviews is suspect,  let alone fewer than  5 and all are 1 or 2 star.    Inchin drinks were delightful,  especially the Whiskey,  peach,  and jalapeño drink.  The servings were plentiful and the servers abundant.    We had a multi course meal of appetizers,  entrée,  and dessert.  I cannot stop thinking about the spicy chicken and the fantastic curry.    The host was very friendly and accommodating from seating to beverages.  She provided a brief overview of the restaurant,  it's history,  and multiple locations across the nation.  Who'd have thought this restaurant began in Atlanta,  a Pan-Asian venue,  in Hot-Lanta!    Well,  I would love to come back again and try more of their tasty takes on Asian cuisine,  next time I'll bring the wife!   Until then, a shot out to Hailey,  thanks for your hard work and continued dedication to all things Yelp!
