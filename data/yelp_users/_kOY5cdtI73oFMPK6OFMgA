One of my favorite lunch spots.  Again, a family owned restaurant that I absolutely love!  This is the best Greek in town!  It is authentic, inexpensive and tasty.  It makes that Big Fat place look like Olive Garden.   My favorites are the gyro feta pita, the hummus, chicken picado pita (add feta), the french fries are probably the best ever, the dolmades are little bites of sunshine.  The portions are huge and they are always generous with the feta (and the onions - who eats that many onions anyway?!).  The onions are easy to pick off though...  They have the best fruit salad bowl I've ever had!  The owners and the staff are the best!  I just wish that I could convince them to open for dinner and for the weekends.    Plus, I always feel safe with all of the cops who eat there!

Casa Reynoso is habit forming.  We come here at least once a week.  This is the best Mexican food that this native Arizonan has ever had.  Some of our favorites...bean burro enchilada style, beef tacos (I'm always wishing that I ordered two when I'm half way through my first), the gollo burro, machaca beef burro enchilada style, buttery homemade tortillas....Yum!  My only complaint is that they are not open on Mondays and sometimes I get a hankering for Mexican food on Mondays that cannot be satisfied elsewhere.   We love that it is family owned and that they all make us feel like we're part of the family.  Our favorite server is Erica - she had our order memorized after the first time.  The margaritas are tasty and the beer is cold!  The atmosphere is casual, the food is tasty and the prices are reasonable.

Four words - expensive, old people food.    I wish this place was good because of its very convenient location.  Its just not my kind of food.

This is probably our favorite Indian Food restaurant.  The buffet is the way to go.  The naan (especially when fresh out of the kitchen) is super tasty.  My favorite is the chicken mahkani.  The rest of the dishes, especially the vegetarian selections are very good too.  The staff is always friendly and I like that the restaurant is family owned and operated.  My only complaint is the bathrooms - they need a little TLC (and sanitizing).

Hands down - the best sushi on the planet.  This is one of my neighborhood favorites.  Whenever we have family in town, we are sure to bring them here.  I had to give my cousin (a sushi virgin) a stern warning though - "you will not be able to find sushi like this elsewhere and may find yourself making frequent trips out to AZ just for the sushi" (she lives in PA).  I love the ASU roll, the Vegas roll, the salmon nigiri, the escolar nigiri, the toro nigiri, the dragon roll, the booty booty roll.  Aside from the incredible symphony of flavors that they are able to create in their rolls, this family owned and operated business has one of the best deserts out there.  Their tempura ice cream with strawberries, bananas, whipped cream and chocolate sauce is a sweet end to an incredible meal.

I'm not normally a "salad-person".  Somehow, Lisa makes salads taste SO good that I find myself craving her leafy-greens on a regular basis.  The cranberry salad is my favorite.  The steak in the steak salad was a little too well-done.  I wish that my server had given me the option med-rare on that one.  The balls are yummy - I just wish that they came with a side salad (here I go with the leafy greens again...).  The green tea is my favorite drink there - very refreshing.    I wish that the lunch prices were $2 lower and that the acoustics were a little better in there.  Maybe lay down a few rugs?  The bathrooms are nice though!

I'll be up front - I've never eaten here before.  Right before they changed locations, we had read so many great things on yelp that we had to go there.  We walked in and immediately got a whiff of something truly nasty - there must have been a back up in their sewer because it smelled awful.  We turned on our heels and headed out the door.  We tried to give it another chance but they were in the middle of moving locations.  Does anyone know the scoop on why they moved?  Did it have something to do with that hideous smell?    We're excited to actually eat here but need reassurances that the new place smells better.

The new location passes the smell test!  We had the red curry chicken and the chicken pad thai.  I really liked the consistency, flavor and spiciness of both of the dishes.  They could have been a little more generous with the chicken and shrimp.    The bathroom is nice and clean.  I like the new location and I like the decorations.  However, they need to break the space up a little bit with some divider walls or hanging dividers and lights that come down from the ceilings on the tables.  It is a little too much like a big open auditorium.    The service was fabulous!

Very good Thai food at a great price!  We tried the pad thai and the red curry.  Both were excellent.  Yeah, it is a hole in the wall and they will never be known for their decor, but I'm not a snob when it comes to yummy food.  It is clean, the service is great and the food is authentically delicious!

I challenge you to find a better slice in town.  Seriously, this is better than the pizza we've had in NY.  The cheese, crust and sauce become one.  The crust is to die for.  When ordering take out, the car is filled with such an amazingly appetizing aroma that I can barely wait to tear open the box as soon as I walk through the door.  Eating in the restaurant is equally pleasurable.  The restaurant is super clean, the staff is very friendly and attentive and the owner is the real deal.  If you love low-key places with awesome food and great service, you should definitely try out Yo Pauly's.  We live 20 miles away...but it is always worth the drive when I'm craving pizza.  The wings are good too!

We used to go here all of the time.  Then one day the waiter refused my substitution of a flour tortilla for corn on my enchilada, despite having requested and received this modification on countless occasions before.  It got ugly.  Turns out that they would not satisfy my request because they made all of the enchiladas in the morning and would not make a fresh enchilada for me. I was livid.  This was WAY before I discovered Yelp.  I asked to speak with the manager who was a total jerk.  I vowed never to return.  Three years later...I happened to be in a forgiving mood and we happened to be in the neighborhood so we decided to stop by and try it out again.  Alas, the prices had climbed too high, the food wasn't as good as we remembered, and the service sucked (they got my husband's order wrong) and the rest is history.  I vow once again never to return.

We've been to Logans half a dozen times.    The Good: all you can eat peanuts, all you can eat yummy buttery soft rolls, decent service, big portions.  The Bad: overcooked steaks and burgers on several occasions, lots of fried food - bordering on TGI Friday's bar food.  The Ugly: Stop freaking asking us if it is our first time here!  Seriously - every single time they ask us this and it makes them look like nobody ever comes back.  And how many hostesses does one place need?  I swear, they had 6 hostesses at the door all exuding insincere salutations.
