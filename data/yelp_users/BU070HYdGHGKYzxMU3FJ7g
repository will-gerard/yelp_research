Postinos is one of my favorite places to go with my friends. We're even considered regulars by the hostess and valet! We go every Monday for the $20 board and bottle of wine special they have after 8 pm. One draw back is sometimes the wait can be 1-2 hours long (On these nights we go to LGO instead).  Postinos is also a great source for entertainment. People think it's a great first or second date spot. They are wrong. The one down town is significantly quieter and a way better date spot. But, there are always at least five new couples there. If you're a low talker or extremely shy you should probably try somewhere else. But don't worry, I'll be there every Monday night with my bottle of wine.

Go in October so you can get the Pumpkin Porter! Also, they have the best french fries in all of Phoenix. Filling up a growler is just $10.... do it!

Pretty good place to get a keg. It kinda smells like pee if you go in when you're sober.

Great place to go for lunch! They can usually get you in and out and back to work near Mill in an hour! I suggest getting half a sandwich and a beer. It's more than enough to fill you up and ends up costing the same and just a sandwich! I've never been there at night but I'm sure it's great then too.

Get the soup! It is to die for. All the waiters are great and the food is VERY tasty!

I was only here for Cupcake Love In but the hotel looked beautiful. The space was a little cramped and the bar had this "great" deal for $5 of a build your own Bloody Mary bar. It was cool but if you don't have a lot of experience making Bloody Mary's and are probably hung over and just want to drink ie: Me, I would just have them make it. (It costs the same)

I tried this place out for the first time with a party of seven this last First Friday. The food was to die for. If you don't like spicy food you should tell them; but, I got the jerk chicken and it was perfectly cooked and amazingly seasoned. My friend got the scallops and they were probably the best I've had in Phoenix. We had to wait a while for our table (not surprised since we had a large group and it was Friday night) but they had a a live band playing in the back, a great seating area to wait in and a great drink list (even though I don't really like rum). I will definitely be coming back.

The elephant garlic is a must! The sangria is delicious - try mixing together the white and red if you get "bored"   It's always a delight sitting on the patio on on a couch with a few friends and sipping on a glass of wine. They also always have random movies playing in the back ground with adds a little extra something to the atmosphere!

I have only ordered delivery from here but let me tell you, it's pretty much amazing. My husband and I order something just about every other weekend. We always try something new and we've never been disappointed! From most of the reviews it sounds like the restaurant is pretty sketchy. I can't speak for that. But the food is delicious.

Great atmosphere! This is a great place to go on the weekend (or week night) if you want to sit at a table with your friends. There is great patio and bar seating. They don't get mad if your friends get too loud but it's a pretty laid back place. They also do gold fish racing on Thursdays which is hilarious to watch.

I Love love love! The yogurt here! Way better than mojo! It's $.09 cheaper and ounce and the froyo is kept slightly colder so it doesn't melt as fast!

Worst bar I've ever been to. I was here for a bachelorette party and I think it would have been more pleasant in a sewer. The bartenders are rude, the people are unattractive and dancers have a nasty attitude. Also,  the toilets in the girls bathroom were overflowing for the 40 minutes we were there. No one turned off the water valve on the back of the toilet. Some creeper guy just kept mopping up the continuous flow of sewage.

If you're looking for a hang out in the middle of summer, keep on walking. Since it has an open window bar plus misters it will be about 100 degrees with 80% humidity inside. The tacos here are pretty good, but a little pricey for Tempe in my opinion. It's also a great place to visit for happy hour but we weary of staying too late because it quickly changed into a "club" (by Tempe standards) shortly after 10.   One benefit is that the large couch area is pretty good for large groups snacking and drinking.

I went to Big Earl's this week with my co-workers and the BBQ is amazing! I don't know how good the ribs were but I got the pulled pork and mac n' cheese (my favorite BBQ dish) and it was probably some of the best I've ever had. (I'll say it. Better than Joe's Real BBQ!) The portions were huge and reheated wonderfully - I'm eating them now as I write this review! Parking isn't easy in old town but they have their own parking lot. Also, the chef even came out and talked to us while we ate. It was an all around great atmosphere.   I'm only sad I didn't get to stay for happy hour -  $3 sangria! I need to clarify that. I'm so sad I didn't get to partake in happy hour since I had to go back to work. I can say for sure, I'll be back for HH and some more mac n' cheese!

I checked this place out over the weekend and I know, I know... Another yogurt place. But trust me, this place is wonderful! Even past the great pictures and clean store they had 20 different flavors and more toppings than I knew what to do with. I'll definitely be going back. It's my nephew's new favorite fro-yo place! The hardest part will be picking between cheesecake and red velvet cake! yumm!!

Great cup of coffee! I was so excited when this location opened at the end of last year. The location on Mill was always on my way to work but after moving, it was a little out of the way - still completely worth it though. But this one is totally on the way! It's a great place to get a mocha. They're made with real chocolate milk!

Dream Retreats was a great fit for us! We had grass, rocks, plants and a paver patio installed about 2 months ago and couldn't be happier. I wasted a lot of time talking to other companies that either never got back to me, provided quotes that were 3x my budget, told me they were out of my price range or weren't currently accepting bids. We worked on the design with Sonny and he did a great job coming up with something we could actually afford that also looked awesome! There was some hurry up and wait (which I'm pretty sure is extremely common in this industry) and minimal notice when work would be done. (I'd get a call in the afternoon with a 1-2 day window of when work would happen). They started working 3-4 weeks after we put down a deposit and were done in less than a week. We'll definitely be using them again if we move or do our front yard.
