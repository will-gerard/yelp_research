I am completely against tanning but I love to get my spray tan by Darlene at The Beach House Tanning Salon! She is very informative and makes you feel extremely comfortable during the service. As she spray tans you, she thoroughly explains before and after care. Darlene is definitely a pro at spray tanning because my results were outstanding. I re book with her at least every couple of weeks. She also runs specials for clients who book on line with her, five dollars off for the on line booking. If your a first time airbrush client go see Darlene at The Beach House Tanning Salon. I've been to other places for the same service and no one has ever made me feel as comfortable as Darlene has and no one has ever sat down and taken the time to explain the service. The atmosphere is super cute ,beachy of course, and very clean. And it definitely has a nice touch to it because The Beach House Tanning Salon is family owned and operated.

This is a great Aesthetic supply store and I highly recommend. Bertha has Aesthetic supplies that you can purchase locally rather than order from out of state.  She has a very nice selection of professional products. I was running late one day  and desperately needed to purchase some supplies, I called Bertha to let her know I was on my way and she told me to take my time and that she would wait for me. OUTSTANDING customer service Bertha, Thank You.  Bertha also caters to Aesthetics Students who are not quite licensed yet. If you are a current Aesthetics Student you just have to show your student ID. I think this is such a wonderful opportunity for the Students as they are not only practicing during school hours but they also practice outside of school hours. Normally Aesthetic supply companies will not allow anyone to purchase Aesthetic supplies unless they have a license.

I give this place 2 stars because the customer service was very friendly and great! other than that the place is kinda dirty (grungy) and the food was over priced. The food was not horrible but nothing to brag about either. I felt like i could have made the same in my own kitchen but probably better. drinks are over priced as well. they have a happy hour but not really happy hour prices. Personally I wont be going back.

I absolutely love this BBQ. I'm a BBQ snob considering I was raised in Texas where the BBQ is real BBQ! Waldo's is definitely Texas BBQ style! Delicious! Not to mention the excellent customer service the restaurant offers. They have great specials during the week Monday - Thursday for kiddos. Kiddos get a free meal with a purchase of an adult meal. They have great specials on beer too. They offer draft to bottled beer as well as a full bar. The BBQ sauce .......IS THE BEST! the french  fries are to die for and the pork sand which is out of this world! I've never had anything that I disliked at  Waldo's or have ever had a poor experience with the wait staff. Excellent customer service and Excellent food!

you definitely lost me as a customer. my friend and i went in on a Sunday afternoon  specifically for the veggie tray. We sat outside considering it was a beautiful day. We waited 15 minutes, while flagging down  the waitress. she completely ignored us. the people at the table next to us noticed her ignoring us and said they would ask her to come over to us when she returned to their table with their drinks. Still, she continued to ignore us. Then I proceeded to tell the hostess and she did not seem very concerned and said she would send someone over. We waited another five minutes, still no service. So, we left. that is SO ridiculous! never again will i return to this place. That was the absolute worst customer service and made us feel very unwelcome.

This is the best urgent care! I actually make a longer drive to be seen at Alliance Urgent Care because the Doctor's and staff members are extremely professional and caring. The wait is never too long for an Urgent Care, at least from my experience. My daughter and I usually see Dr. Linzer or Dr. Tyler Carter. I just love these guys!! Very professional and both are great about cheering up my Little one when she is very ill. I like Dr. Linzer and Dr. Carter so much I'd love to have either one as our family physician. Unfortunately you cannot call the urgent care to see which Dr's are on staff, although we have been lucky enough to see Dr, Linzer and Dr. Carter each time. Considering how professional these two are I'm sure the other Doctor's on staff must be as professional and thorough as they are. There are many urgent cares in the area please check out Alliance Urgent Care, you won't regret it! :)

I feel like a spoiled princess everytime I go here! Dear Lord the food and drinks are out of this world,  and the customer service is outstanding. The $8 bottle of champagne is such a great deal! Their hamburgers are by far the best! So great that no ketchup, mayo, mustard necessary. Im so glad I took a chance and decided to try a new wine bar. A wine bar with so many other options on the menu than most I have ever been too. I highly recommend this restaurant. You won't regret it!

The customer service was terrible. When ordering, I told the cashier that this was my first time here and I knew of the restaurant from a flyer I read at work. I proceeded to ask the cashier what he would recommend. The cashier spoke in an extremely quiet voice , could barely hear him and he could not answer my question. As this was going on, I had noticed dirty tables all over the restaurant. Dirty dishes everywhere. I still continued with my order because the menu looked so delicious and I had planned on eating there for lunch and the place was busy. I ate outside because of all the empty dirty tables. It took 15 minutes , maybe a lil longer to be served my order. I wasn't even served , I actually had to go back to cashier and ask for my order. Honestly, the food was not worth all the poor customer service. I gave the restaurant a chance and I feel it was a waste of my time and money. I will never go back.

So amazing! It was so good I couldn't stop eating. The customer service was excellent! :) they make these big pretty fruity drinks too. Their homemade tortillas are out of this world. I just wish they served alcohol. I will be back.

This place is extremely sanitary and professional.  Very soothing and relaxing as they play light classical music and do not have a bunch of TVs around the spa. I only get pedicures, this is the only place I go for that service. The staff is always very sweet and extremely thorough and meticulous when I'm having my pedicure service as they always do such an amazing job. If I cant get in every couple of weeks my pedicure literally lasts a month. I recommend Encore Nail and Spa to all my friends and clients. Even though I do not have any nail services ( acrylics) , when I am  having my pedicure service I always hear compliments from the clients who are having this service done.

I do not recommend this place. The office staff is very unorganized. It takes to long to get an appointment. Dr. Richardson is no longer there and the quality of medical staff is not good. Verve medical group only offers a physician assistant now, not a Doctor. They have messed my appointments up several times and even turned me away from my appointment on a Friday! I had already waited a week in a half to get in, therefore, I  had to go to urgent care. The office is beautiful and clean but that's about it.
