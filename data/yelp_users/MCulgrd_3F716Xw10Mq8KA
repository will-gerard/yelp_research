Got together here with some friends for my birthday a while back.  They were easy to set a reservation with completely online.  Some of the group showed up late and there was a pushy group waiting for a table behind us but they made sure we still got our place in line.  The food was great and came out quick and the server had no problem splitting the tab several ways.  Definitely will continue to come back

TERRIBLE!! I wish 0 stars were possible..  I have lived in North Scottsdale for 6 years.  That being said I have lived in several nice properties within the area and dealt with several property management companies.  I can honestly say the staff at this location, Mario in particular, has put on the worst show of arrogance I have ever encountered.  Some may say there is a standard to uphold in nicer parts of Scottsdale such as Grayhawk, however by no means does that mean condescending attitudes towards certain demographics.  My girlfriend and I sat patiently waiting to be helped for a good amount of time, all the while watching the leasing agent put on a show for two older women.  As soon as they leave and he starts working with us, there was a complete change in his demeanor and cockiness.  I was looking forward to touring this property and living somewhere brand new, but after working with this guy I was completely put off.  It couldn't have been more obvious that he not only didn't care about taking the time to show us the floorplan we came to see, but he might of well just said you shouldn't be here!  It's just rude, think twice about living here if you are young and don't appear to have money because the snooty staff will send you out the door with a brochure and the most unwelcoming experience you've ever had.
