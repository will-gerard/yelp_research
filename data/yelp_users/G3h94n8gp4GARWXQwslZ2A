After being a long time patient of this practice I felt I needed to write a review.  The doctors and PA's treat us like a number.  There is no real concern or care.  The office staff at first was great but they have gotten progressively worse.  It is very difficult to get information from them or to create any dialogue outside of making a doctor appointment.  I am very disappointed.  If you are shopping for a doctor keep on shopping.

What a great place and a great cause.  I went there last night for Comedy Open Mic.  The comedians were running there new stuff by us and it was great.   My wife had a Iced Green Tea and I had the Pacific Northwest smoothie which was out of this world good and reminded me of Oregon.  This place would rock in Oregon.   All of the money goes to help support NATN: http://www.natn-az.com/home/cup_o_karma  Copied from their Homepage: Cup O' Karma: Community Cafe for a Cause, a project of NATN, provides job-training opportunities for women participating in our SEEDs programs.
