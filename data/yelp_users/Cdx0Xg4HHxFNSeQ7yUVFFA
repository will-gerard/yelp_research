Excellent service from the bartenders. Ordered a Kale & Salmon salad, no bacon, was phenomenal! Great place to watch baseball, hockey, or whatever sport you please. They are accommodating to your TV requests as well.

White Peach Sangria is delicious!!! Bartender is phenomenal, definitely recommend for happy hour drinks. However I wouldn't recommend for happy hour sushi, it's very basic. The RArripop is my favorite item on the menu. The Las Vegas roll is decent, however I'm not a fan of fried food. I had the rainbow roll on happy hour, and it's a basic rainbow roll. Great place to get some dinner before headed out for the night.

If you're in town visiting Arizona, this is by far my favorite place to bring friends visiting. Great beer, great food, great people. The pizza is phenomenal, the salads are incredible, the food is freaking amazing.

My favorite thing to get here is the Mediterranean Chicken Salad. It's HUGE btw. The hummus is the best I've ever had, the small is a good size for 3-4 people as a starter cause the actual meals you order are huge. I usually order extra pita with it. They have a bar as well, smaller than most, but still nice to have a beer or glass of wine with dinner/lunch.

Went for brunch on a Sunday, ordered a Mimosa and Crab Cakes. Both were very good. The service was excellent, the waiter was very attentive. I would definitely recommend for a nice Sunday afternoon brunch place. They were fairly busy when I went as well, but still received excellent & quick service and delicious food.

FROZEN EDAMAME... Need I say more? This place used to be good. Honestly, go to Culinary Dropout and don't waste your money here.

It's a good place to check out, however every other mall is better in my opinion. They don't have any major department stores and even lack some basic stores in my opinion. The only place people really go there for is the movie theater and Dave & Busters.

My usual barista is great, so there's no way it's the same one. But whoever made this needs to learn how to again. There was wayyyy too much pumpkin spice syrup in it, that there was literally a layer at the bottom of my Frappuccino. A blended drink should not have a layer of syrup on the bottom!

Very disappointed in this place. I expected the food to be much better. Drinks took a little long to get. Overall, not a fan, wouldn't ever recommend despite how busy they were.

Incredible cleaning service! I had removed my very dead Christmas tree which made a disaster of a mess. I was looking to have someone come immediately, so I started browsing and found them. It was after business hours, but I called and left a message and received a text about an hour later to confine a 5pm appointment. They then called me the next day and told me they could move it up to 3:30pm, which was perfect! They brought all their own supplies and started on the 3rd floor of my townhome. It is a 2 bed/ 2 bath. They vacuumed, dusted, made the beds, cleaned the bathrooms, cleaned the kitchen, dining room and living room in record time! I will definitely be using them again in the future!

We called cause we didn't have an appointment and they were able to take us right way. I got gel removed and then a new gel French manicure added. They did a really great job cleaning up your hands and making sure everything was perfect, I don't think I've ever seen my nails look so perfect. I'm definitely coming back to get pedicure. They also have a buy 10 get a pedicure free.

Amazing customer service. They opened the door for us as we walked in, seated immediately, ordered drinks, they let us taste a few different beers for no charge, ordered food and it arrived incredibly fast! Ahi Tuna Salas is delicious! Slight kick to it for the sauce on the tuna, ask for it on the side if you're uncertain. Loved it!

I come here every time I fly, it's my go to place for a meal and drink before I board the plane. Do order the Quinoa salad, Do not order chips and Guacamole (super small and not worth it). They have a great bar, it's an upscale place, love the decor. They have my favorite beer, Belgian Tripel on tap!

Love this place! They have a FREE Wine Tasting every Tuesday & Friday with some small snacks to go along. The inside bar is nice to sit at and chat with the employees there who are extremely nice and very helpful and knowledgeable about the wine. They also offer specialty beers, like the Stone Enjoy By, which I went in to go buy for my bf. They had 1 left in a separate fridge and ended up giving it to me to purchase.

If you have a layover here you should eat or grab a drink here! The food menu is smaller than the actual restaurant in Tempe, but it's great food and obviously great beer. I love the style of the seating, it has a restaurant feel but there is also a big table where a bunch of random layover people will sit and have a drink. Great for meeting new people.

Get the bruschetta!! It's definitely a must when you come here. I also have had the mozzarella, mmmmm so good. It's a really cute place for a date, not too crowded or noisy, not in college town, but close, so do expect a younger crowd.
