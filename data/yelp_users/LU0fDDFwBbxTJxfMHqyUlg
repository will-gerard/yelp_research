I love it here!   The food is exceptional whether in the restaurant or at the bar. The atmosphere is fantastic and the service is as well.   I've come here several times for business as well as personal occasions and have never been let down. It is definitely a place you will want to schedule a reservation for on weekends though, as the wait can become a bit long without one. However, it is always worth the wait and a great experience!

This was our first time here and we will definitely be back.  The food was amazing and affordable and the kids even loved it. The only reason it's not getting 5 stars from me is because it was pretty dirty in the seating area. I guess you should expect that to be the case at a restaurant in a strip mall but since it was so hyped up I had higher expectations in that area.

Terrible experiences with employees who seem to not have a clue what is going on. I brought my son to be checked for strep. After waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes we were finally taken to a room where a nurse took vitals and did a throat swab. After waiting an additional 35 minutes firvthevresukt
