I've been a fan of Coffee Rush for years. It's the same great family working there. The staff is much more personable than Starbucks and you never feel uneasy if you want to change the drink because you don't like it. This is a way a business should be ran--friendly, giving back to the customer, knowledgeable about the products, and compassionate.

I have been going to Jon for about a year now. He is very professional and listens to your needs. I had hip surgery a year ago and he has helped me a lot in mobility and just overall feeling better. If there is any kind of muscle ache you have, Jon can fix it. I've gone to several other massage therapists before Jon and could never find one that really listened to the work I needed until I met Jon. I like relaxing massages as long as I can get work done as well and relieve any knots and tight and sore muscles and that's what Jon can do. Highly recommend you try him at least once. He's truly talented.

This place was recommended to me by a friend because I wanted to stop eating out during my lunch hour at food places that weren't so good. I figured with itthis place being healthy and vegan, it would be the new place for me. WRONG!  My co worker and I got there before the lunch rush and ordered. We waited 30 minutes for our food as shortly after we placed our order, the lunch rush came. The workers are young and look very lost as they're walking around. They moved very slowly with no energy. I wouldn't put it past them if it turns out they were all stoned. Customer service is not a priority for them. Even the food wasn't that good and overpriced for the quality. I won't be back.
