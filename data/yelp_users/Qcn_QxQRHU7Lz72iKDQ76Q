My mom and I decided to stay here for a mom and daughter weekend for my 30th birthday. The grounds are very pretty.  When we got to our room since it was later we decided to watch a movie but the remote wasn't working so we called the front desk to see if we could get some help. 30 minutes went by and no had shown up so we called again and the girl claimed she had no idea about it and we waited another 30 minutes for someone to come and push a button to reconnect the remote.   The next day we had a spa day planned and first I had a facial.. The girl I had doing mine was rather snotty about my normal routine and pushed me to change the things I did in my every day life bc my face was too dry (keep in mind I had a dermatologist appt the next day and they told me my face was fine).. So not a fun experience with the facial. Than I had a body scrub which was super nice and a massage from the same girl and she was great!   Than I had a blow dry and the woman was so rough on my head it almost made me cry when she shampooed my head. She almost drenched my face and blamed the sprayer than she put me under a dryer so my hair would dry faster because she had broken her arm and still couldn't use it very well and she accepted taking another client in between to cut his hair. Not okay!! Than when she went to go blow dry my hair she kept pointing the hair dryer on my scalp burning me! And she did a zig zag part (very 90s and out of date) claiming it was her signature as well as curling my ends making me look like a 10 year old!   Overall I'd say the whole spa experience really was not worth it. It did not have very many other amenities beside the services you were get like other spas and all the services provided were not the greatest!   Very disappointed!

The melting pot use to be the place to go to have a great time and have great service! We had gone to the one in north scottsdale the last two times and had horrible service so we decided to give this location a try.   The actual taste of the dessert was probably the only good thing going however, the restaurant use to offer more of each item of the desserts and when we asked why it changed our waitress explained it was because people would sit for hours upon hours just enjoying dessert asking for more pieces to enjoy their chocolate with. Changing their menu for everything to be a la carte but keeping the same prices (each item at least $40) does not make it very affordable for many people. The only restaurant that we knew of for charging a $1 refill on soda and lemonade products.   We decided to go with a couple which probably made it better then it would have been had we of been by ourselves, as our waitress was rude, did not like us asking questions or wanting us to change our minds. She was difficult to stop to ask for something and did not have very nice facial expressions.

This place used to be great! You could find great used designer items for reasonable prices! Now not one good item!   They even used to be really good about giving you a reasonable amount for the items you took to sell! I took a good size laundry basket full there a couple of days ago full of top name brands, the girl took 16 items and only gave me $38 for them! What a rip off! 16 items should get you at least $90! The store wasn't even packed either!   Time to find another resale place that appreciates designer clothing!

They DON'T even deserve 1 star!!!  I have them another chance today and took a huge basket full of brands like jcrew, free people, loft, gap, Michael stars, Bebe and many more! They took 14 items and gave me either $45 in trade or $29 in cash. Tell me how that could be right for the type if items they took?! I asked what the girl priced them at and she told me $5-$6 each. How does that seem right?! I didn't take items that were pilling or damaged or stained! Some even still had tags on them and some had only of been worn once! The buyers of that store do not know what their doing or else the owners tell them to give you nothing for your items! Either way I'm not returning!

I am sad to say we did not have a very good experience this time. My husband and I are big advocates for Flemings but we are not so sure any more.  We visited this time to celebrate our Valentines (a little late but our job schedules don't always allow us to celebrate on the exact dates), I had made a reservation earlier in the day for 6:30 for their "Arizona room" since their dining room was booked. They assured me that it was heated with heaters and a fire but ill get to that... We arrived around 6:10 and let the host staff know we were there.. They already seemed pretty flustered and it was only 6pm.. We waited till about 6:35 ish till we were seated where the fans were all on, ppl at other tables were wearing their heavy coats, none of the heaters were on and the fire really didn't seem to help at all and I shivered the whole time only after asking our waitress if the fans could be turned off.  We waited for our server to come for about 15 min and than waited another 15 min for our drink orders... We finally got to order and waited at least 45 min to an hour before receiving our food. My husband ordered his fav, the filet and a baked potato (medium), however, what came out was almost done with no pink at all in the center and I ordered the pork chop with the mushrooms, it was just okay... Not better than what I could make on my grill at home!  The server finally came back to check on us and when my husband replied that his steak was just okay she must have mentioned it to the manager. He walked over, asked how our meal was and gave us a coupon for $25 off to use Feb18-March 28th...as well as removed the steak from our bill... We were glad they did something but sad that we were so excited to go to one of our fav more upscale restaurants only to be pretty disappointed.  We weren't sure if it is under new management or new ownership all together but I hope something happens fast or else most people will start to go to the other locations.

Sweet Cakes is a hidden treasure with amazing baked goods!   Their sandwiches are pretty darn good also! The best is their chicken salad sandwich! Their cookies are huge and their 5 layer brownie is to die for! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it! They are also pretty reasonable with timing in how long it takes them to prepare the food which is nice!   A must try!

We normally love Pei Wei but yesterday when we went we ordered our normal order of chicken fried rice and pot stickers. When we got our fried rice there was a hair at least 4" long weaves through the rice. So disgusting, I took the plate over to a server standing next to the manager and tried to get the managers' attention (he ignored me) so I pulled the hair out of the rice and showed the the server. She took the plate from me not saying a word and followed me back to our table to pick up the bowl and took it back to the kitchen. I had to ask her a few minutes later if they were remaking it an she nodded yes. The manager never came over to our table and seemed to hide in the back until his shift ended.  One of our favorite restaurants and we will not be visiting for awhile!

Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in Mesa! The staff is always nice and the restaurant is always clean!  The menu has a nice variety of items in each category whether you prefer a sandwich, wrap, or salad! Their side of potato salad is pretty darn good too! It's nice for when they have the cookie day you get so many cookies for like $1! This is a must in downtown Mesa!

We were there for lunch on a Saturday. The restaurant was not filled but there was a good amount of people, there was only 1 waitress who was very quiet. We waited 5 minutes for her to get us menus, another 15 minutes to bring us drinks for which she did not even complete the actual order and then another 40 minutes for our food to be brought out for which the food was poorly prepared. Someone in our group had ordered sliders, he thought they would be ground beef but they were sliced prime rib (something the server should have mentioned), and another person ordered onion rings with their sandwich for which they didn't even stay together nor did the batter cover the entire ring which made them terrible, the waitress did not even offer a sauce besides ketchup to go with them, as well as another person in our group order the steak salad and the steak was so hard it could barely be cut as well as the fact that the lettuce overwhelmed the salad too much! Let's just say our first experience at this restaurant will be our only experience!

This place is amazing! The chicken fried rice is the best thing on the menu but of course their yellow curry is pretty good too! They didn't get a full five stars as when my coworkers and I dined in it took forever to get our food when we were the only ones there and we had come at opening. As well as their wait staff we have come in contact with have not been the friendliest. Definitely worth going for the food!

This review is for the salon!   Doesn't even deserve a full star but can't do half.. So Saturday Feb 13th I booked an appointment on the phone for an up do and to get my make up done bc I was going to a wedding the next day. The girl on the phone advised me everything was good to go and that the stylist doing my hair did not have anyone before me and that I could come in a little early if I wanted.  Sunday Feb 14th, yes Valentine's Day... I got to the salon about ten minutes early and the stylist asked what we were doing for the wedding in a way like I was the bride. I calmly explained what was going on and she seemed a little frantic. I guess there was a major mix up and whoever booked the appointment made it seem like I was a bride coming in to get her hair and make up done.  1st mistake. Next I showed her a bunch of pictures of what I was looking for and she said she understood and loved the look. She started to curl my hair but as she did each section put SO much product in my hair that the next day literally took me 3 shampoos and 2 conditioners just to get all the product out! 2nd mistake!   Once she was done curling she asked to look at the picture again, she started to put the curls up and made it so tight with just half my hair my eyes started to tear up. I tried to tell her and her eyes started to tear up like she was going to cry! It had already taken 2 hours at this point which I was told I'd already be done with both hair and make up.. So as a time but I was getting a little frantic. It was 2pm at that time and the wedding my husband and I were going to was at 4:30, 30 minutes away from where we lived. 3rd mistake! She finished somewhat putting the top of my hair up but it looked so bad from all the product and not in any way of what the picture I showed her was like that I was so unhappy! I finally told the stylist if we could please just move onto makeup and she said yes but shaking in her voice.  **keep in mind the entire time her hands were shaking uncontrollably!! ** the hair stylist told me that bc of the scheduling mix up that she was going to do my make up bc the esthetician was booked. I said okay but felt very uneasy. She went and asked one of the girls from the Benefit counter to help and if it wasn't for her I probably would have walked right out.   My make up didn't get finished bc it was so late. Needless to say the hair stylist got me a good discount, I didn't pay for the make up and she explained that she told her manager everything, HOWEVER, the manager never came to say anything to me and you have to go wait in line at the front to checkout which made me late even more bc there were already 4 people in line and only one register working!   All in all DON'T go to the salon at Ulta! One of the stylist came in for her shift complaining about closing that night and was told she would be busy and complained even more! So not cool!!

This nail salon was the last place I tried the day before Valentine's Day.. Of course I was happy to get in but there were some issues..   The spa pedicure was great.. The girl who did it was very nice however I only did the regular as I did not want to pay extra for an extra fifteen minutes of massage.   The same girl who did my pedicure also did my manicure but without asking started to do gel nails. Which I DID NOT WANT! They ruin my nails and take forever to take off! She didn't even ask? Just assumed that bc I asked for French on both that my finger nails would be gel. Not okay! I started to ask if that was what she was doing and she didn't quite unfettered that I didn't want gel so she called another lady over to try to communicate with and that lady was just like no no not gel but keep the gel base layer.   My nails ended up looking okay but not great. I will probably not be coming back as the girl was not nice to me after I corrected her.

I love this company and usually their customer service is great but not this time...  Okay so I purchased a groupon for this company and first off did not realize it was only for this location but once I really looked at it figured that out. AND since a family member knew that I loved this company purchased one for me too. Once discovering that I needed to go to that location and realized that the groupon expired on Oct 1st (which I bought it in the middle of August so not very long to use) and redeemed September 22 I called to order so it would be ready when I got there, which made it easier for me as I was traveling from east Mesa to pick up this order up.  I called on Sept 21 to see what I needed to do since I had the groupon and they said I could call in my order when I was on my way but couldn't order online with a groupon which was totally fine.  So I called to order, the girl on the phone seemed rather bothered by the fact that I was calling in an order, I explained that I was coming from Mesa with a groupon. I did not know that I needed to say I had two. Or that it would even be an issue but when I got there and pulled out my groupon the girl at the counter rolled her eyes and gave me a look. She whined at me and asked if I had told the person on the phone that I had two groupons. I said no and that I didn't realize I needed to. She then started whining again at me repeating multiple times that if she let me use both of the groupons for that visit (keep in mind they were in two different names) that she would get fired! Who tells a customer that they can't do something bc they will get fired?! I've been in customer service for 15 years and have always found a solution for a customer! NEVER have I ever said I couldn't do something bc I would get fired!   So instead of taking the two bundtinis like I ordered I only took the one and don't really have the interest in using the second groupon as I really don't want to drive all the way back there for poor customer service!   If your location is going to offer a groupon don't be rude about it when someone comes to use it!

This restaurant was absolutely amazing the first time we went. We sat in the very back as we were in a group of six. The service was great the food was great, the entire experience.   However our second experience was not as great. We sat in a smaller room near the kitchen with another couple. The section of space that had 4 tables in it was very small and compact. Not easy to hear people talk. Don't get me wrong the food was great but our server was awful! He didn't care to make sure our food was correct he did not come back at the appropriate times to check on us.   The dessert we ordered which was the small tree came with 5 pieces of the dessert however, it was really like 4 and a half as the 5th was so small! We had finished out dessert and the other couple we were with was finishing their cappuccinos and some of the waiters came and took our water glasses. Others had started setting up the room and the other tables as if they were preparing for a big group. And someone stood outside the section as if he were waiting to kick us out like security!   Our bills were in NO WAY cheap! We even tried to contact the manager but he never called back. To say the least we will not be returning.

We went here on Mother's Day bc of course every other place had an hour wait at 8 am! With two toddlers going out to eat is not easy but this place was easy! It's a concept like Sauce which is easy, they have plenty of high chairs available and the staff was upper nice! My omelette was even pretty darn good for the price! I wish they would put one out in Mesa!
