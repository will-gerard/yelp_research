I really like this place. They make me feel like a human being and as a beginning guitar enthusiast I'm glad that they were able to accommodate my needs. I just started and as a beginner I couldn't be more pleased. Highly recommend! Thanks Guys and Gals! You're help is greatly appreciated!

I never thought I'd buy another guitar but I did and a nice one at that after coming in for some cords and a power supply for my distortion pedal. What I really appreciate about these good people is that they don't try and push you into a product you have no budget for or don't need. I really appreciate their honesty and desire to help. I can emphatically say that" I Love This Place!"  And now the rest of the story....  My mini schnauzers chewed my cords to my amplifier and distortion pedal power supply cable. Needless to say I had to replace them. Ah well. It happens. But I was looking at purchasing an acoustic/electric guitar...maybe a Fender, Gibson or a Martin. All are great brands and I came across a nie Ibanez. It was awesome, and the last one too. It was love at first sight. Next thing I know I've got a case, strap, an awesome guitar and the cables I needed. I can't wait to visit them again. Fantastic place and good people.

OK Well, what more can I say about this place? It's DANGEROUS!!!! Sorry honey but I just love guitars. The way they look, sound and feel. Now it's no lie that I like collecting things but I love collecting guitars and am blessed with a couple from this place. Wild Bill is a great guy and he is just so down to earth. Go and see him. He's very passionate and knowledgeable. But be careful...you go in for one thing...you'll come out with many things! I would encourage you all to check this place out and when you buy a stock guitar, get the strings changed asap. Buy the extended warranty and keep your investments safe and sound.   Always a pleasure and always a joy! Love it!

OMG I love this place. My wife and I had our kitchen remodel done through these folks about a month ago and we also bought a storage unit from them. They delivered in more ways than one. Seems like our household is undergoing a series of projects and I'll be honest they deliver. Scott who did our kitchen knocked it out of the park and I couldn't be more pleased.   Recently our back patio had the awning replaced and we had a roof put in. Unfortunately for the roofing company I didn't feel that they'd finished the job and left a lot undone. Needless to say I have to paint the natural wood beams to accommodate and make it flow and match. Justin in the paint department was amazing and really did a great job setting me up with a good color, all the necessaries and he's looking forward to seeing the end results. The pricing wasn't bad at all either. I can't wait to finish this project and to go back for our bathroom remodel and whatever else our home needs.

I've been going to this car show for quite sometime now as its basically in my back yard and so has my car club. We pretty much were birthed as a club here and have enjoyed showcasing our cars. It gets a star for accessibility when that's possible and another for the Target, YCs and Yogurtology close by. It would have more stars though if the owners, Salt River Project Police Department and management company stopped punishing clubs that have nothing to do with the poor choices of individuals (those who choose to do burn outs, make traffic problems and ruin it for first time attendees). I've been  asked to leave early twice now for my car (it has an interactive sound system and is a Transformers Edition Bumblebee Camaro). Not a cheap car by any makes or means, but it's not being shown to make this show look good, but for the children who enjoy seeing one of their favorite pop culture characters up close and personal.  I think what's really sad is when assumptions are made and those who go to this show and have for a while are lumped in with those who ruin it. I went to the McDonald's that hosts this show and they have no show guidelines on sight. I looked online and the hours vary from 4-8 to 4-10. On July 13 we were all asked to leave at 10 as the show was over. I was asked to turn my car down to a muted level as my sound was competing with their DJs. In the past I was allowed to showcase my system after 8pm but that's not the case anymore I guess. If I didn't comply, I would be asked to leave.  Like I said I've been asked to leave once already last year for the same reason but it was before 8. If complying by their rules and guidelines after 8 is a problem then they're going to have to make the public aware of it, not make an example out of someone in an embarrassing manner.   But the biggest problem I have with this show is the disappointment I have been able to witness in a young child's face because of "management." Nothing breaks my heart more than the sadness of a child. Especially when they can't get a picture taken with my car or even try to enjoy it with my family. I watched that last night. I hope I never see that again. Hearing a child say goodbye too early and because of someone else's poor decisions is not acceptable in my book.   I foresee a loss in interest, revenue, attendance and maybe I'll be back. Maybe. There are other shows to go to and I'd hate to not come back because of someone else. Thank you for your time and as Optimus Prime says "Roll Out."

Well, what can I say? I've been coming here for a while and it is truly a great experience. These folks are very knowledgeable and the classes here are excellent. I took Carbine 1 and enjoyed it thoroughly. Any chance I get to head off to the range...this is where I choose to go. Great selection of firearms, ammo and accessories. If they don't have it they'll order it. Plus they gunsmith, clean and service firearms and have great range officers. I try and make it out 3-4 times a month here and became a member last year. Wait times for a lane is't too bad but it does get pretty busy so bear that in mind. I'd go here every single day if I could! The staff is great and I can't wait to sling some brass and lead again soon!

Now I've been to KO's a few times and have enjoyed it thoroughly after slinging lead at Scottsdale Gun Club. Last night I took home some food to the wife and had the same waiter the other week when we were there. The Adult Grilled Cheese and Cobb Salad were excellent. The waiter was top notch and he has a little one as my wife and I do too. I hope he waits on us again. Good guy, great customer service and the place is really convenient. I think we found another great watering hole! Thanks so much!

I go here with my pals from my Camaro Car Club when we're at the Pavilions and its a great place to grab some grub and chow down. The staff is very friendly and they keep the place hopping. Good food for the price and the next thing you know you've got a hot plate of food and cooked in front of your very eyes. Way to go YC's! I'm definitely a fan that's for sure and look forward to seeing you again soon!

I love going to this place and have for years. It used to be located downstairs but it's been on the second level for a while. I can't say enough how awesome these folks are. Oakley is bombproof stuff and I recently bought a range bag there. Mike the store manager and his team area an amazing group of folks! They are always friendly and take great care of my wife and I.   Thank you Oakley for hiring such good folks! Amazing!

Went here last Friday and was wondering if I would ever get served. I looked the waitress in the eye and asked for a menu and got a blank stare. I was pretty much starving at this point in my day. After finally getting my order in I waited...and waited...and waited. A half hour food ticket is sad. My burger was meh and I had already tapped out. One of the people I sat with commented that my server must not like me too much. I don't know what I did wrong, but I won't be back.

Went here for a birthday gathering this past Saturday and it was my first time even though I only live a few minutes away. All I can say is wow. The rice, the sushi, the Buttermilk New York Strip Steak on the teppanaki grill...amazing. We ate well and enjoyed our service. Ask for Dylan, he was very mindful of our food and our chef was entertaining to say the least. Highly recommended!

Let me just start by saying I love Pita Jungle. I haven't been here in a while but when I make it in its always a good place to have a meal and good service. I was seated and greeted right away. I sat at the bar so it's fair to say that I say right away but there were plenty of seats elsewhere. Needless to say I ordered their grilled chicken and humus dish with some pitas and pine nuts. The chicken is awesome and I love their humus. Having something healthy for any meal is fine with me, and the one thing I noticed about this place is the people. The cooks and wait staff are really on point, and they seem to be enjoying their day. I hear laughter which I like a lot. Now I'm not a business owner or anything but I'm sure that laughter is very much appreciated in the work place. The pace here is fast, but not overbearing. I can't wait to come back for more great food and laughter and appreciation.   Thank you Pita Jungle. Keep doing a great job as always!

Yesterday my wife Jenn and I went here for lunch and I kept reassuring her that this place's food is just awesome. I had my traditional chicken with hummus and Jenn had the salmon and garlic mashed potatoes. Now my wife has a tendency to eat kinda fast when she's found the right dish and to say that she vaporized her salmon is putting it mildly! LOL! I couldn't stop laughing at how much she enjoyed her food. For her first time there she was really impressed and I mentioned that it gets better. Their salads are good and she and I will definitely venture out here again. It was busy but we were able to sit immediately and the wait for our food didn't take long (the salmon usually takes about 15-20 minutes). It was cooked perfectly and to see my wife smile was well worth it. When we left we passed by the notorious Amy's Baking Company and just drove by. Although going there would be tempting to see all the drama, its not worth spending money on a place that violates labor laws, serves horrible food and where Gordon Ramsay walked out. Thankfully Pita Jungle is right there in a rather busy complex and we can't wait to go there again soon!

Let me just say that I've never been a fan of this mouse maze from the get go. Even though the furniture goes together with some relative ease, it still is something to be desired. My wife seems to like it though so this place gets one star becuase of her. Let me speak on their customer service and home delivery and installation for a moment though:  We purchased some cabinets to accent our living room and scheduled home delivery and install. We paid a pretty penny for that service, too. Let the customer beware, you go by their schedule and if you try to reschedule, forget it. They called me the morning of the day that they would be arriving and being the working man I am won't be home, nor will my wife to let them in or take delivery of the cabinets. If you need to reschdule and try and call them to reschedule, they won't. Once they're scheduled its a done deal. Customer service didn't offer any options and so the cabinets will left outside (then again who knows? I sure don't know what's going to happen at this point). And I paid nearly $200 for this? You have to be kidding me! No apologies, no options, no idea what is going to happen.   I'm shaking my head. Thanks a lot IKEA, I'll never shop at your store ever again. You have no customer service and it was a waste of time and money to purchase your products and services that you left me in the dark on.

Horrible. Absolutely horrible! Trying to resolve a bad situation has become even worse now. After trying to call me and attempt to deliver our already paid for furniture, IKEA now is requiring me to come back to their store and reschedule and charge me another delivery attempt fee of $129. It's their policy. What on earth?!?!?!  I let them know my schedule and that I have an appointment at 8am to have my car serviced. "Oh well we can try for between 8am - 6pm." Didn't I just say that I'd be unavailable at 8am? "Well we look at what our delivery company can do and those are the times."   But what about my times? I paid for this service, and am I not the customer? I guess I don't really matter and I'm not coming back. I had them pull the furniture from the back where they were holding it and loaded it up in my car, bad back and everything. It barely fit, hence the desire for home delivery. So be warned about this place. First of all if you schedule home delivery it'll cost you a pretty penny and if you have to reschedule you have to drive down to them to do so where they will charge you again. In my case another $129. If they have to store it it's an additional $10 per day surcharge. It's all in the contract that they have you sign. You go by their schedule, and won't accommodate yours.   I won't be back.

Ok so my lovely wife and I had four days off and decided to have a nice stay-cation here. We had our reception here a month ago and absolutely love the place. The people are wonderful, the pool is clean and the food is good. They even sent us champagne and strawberries, upgraded our accommodations to a casita and well, I'd definitely recommend this place! Big shout out to Jane Vuckovich in catering and events as she made our reception beyond amazing and this visit too. I can't wait to go there again for another stay-cation!

Fantastic! After Carlos O'Brien's laughed at us when we arrived at their establishment asking how the wait was, we went to Blue Agave instead across the parking lot. No wait, great food and great service. We took our baby and they had cheese crisps for kids and also a little fruit cup for her and juice. The waitress was incredible and very accomodating. Wow. All I can say is wow. And being that it was Cinco de Mayo, and that every other restaurant out there was probably busy, these guys were too, but they knocked it out of the park. I highly recommend them!!!! What a great find!

This place is amazing. I've really come to appreciate getting back to my musical roots and also the Guitar Center. Both places are wonderful. I was pretty much blown away by the selection and the staff. I went there today with my pastor and his son and another one of the pastor's son's friends. Fender and a few other music manufacturers were there and when I saw the EVH guitar my heart skipped a beat. So I bought it! Yes another guitar but that's ok. EVH is owned by Fender and Fender's are legendary and play great. Eddie Van Halen is one of my all-time favorite guitarists and to have an EVH is my arsenal...is just awesome. It needs to be set up and tuned but wow. All I can say is wow. Great store, amazing staff and I can't wait to go again soon!!! Thanks Sam Ash!!!

These wonderful people did our wedding this past March and I just have to say it was an absolute joy and pleasure to work with them! Miles and his group were very accommodating and the flow of the wedding was fantastic. We had people come from all over and my cousins in Florida commented how great of a time it truly was! I couldn't be more happy. And to see my wife's face throughout it all...that was my joy. Thank you so much to these great people! I like how they were always consulting with us and kept it stress free. Pricing was perfect and spot on. We were able to pick and choose a custom package and the sound was awesome. It was the best I've ever seen and I would have no problem referring these good people to anyone!

After a long day and for kicks my wife and I decided on Pizza and figured that we'd go to Grimaldis. Unfortunately it was a 45 minute wait and we were starving so we decided to go elsewhere. Bad idea. Now I've been to this place a few times and so getting in and seated wasn't a problem, especially for a Friday night. The food is usually quite good and the pizza is excellent.   Whilst the food is good the service was absolutely lacking tonight. Don't know if that's a common practice for this establishment but we got seated and after about 8 minutes still hadn't been acknowledged by any of the wait staff or given any water. My wife hadn't eaten since 9am, and it'd been about 7 hours for me. We weren't exactly in a mood to be ignored but we were. Three waitresses passed by us and nothing. NOTHING! What on earth is going on here?   So we got up and left....  Then the hostess thanked us for coming in and I thanked her for not serving us. We're starving and we decided to go home.  Papa Johns delivers and he's never let us down.  Take a lesson Picazzos....get your act together or give up the ghost.

Great People, Great Shop. They have some of the best people in the industry working hard to make it happen and they offer better than new service. They have great accessibility and good group rides. I highly recommend them. The selection is just awesome there too. Parking isn't all that bad either. Check 'em out!

These good folks have been my work neighbors for quite sometime now and I took my wife Jenn there yesterday and bought a nice Focus bicycle from them and have a Retuel fit with them on Monday. It really is a pleasure to support a business that does business with us and the entire staff are just a delight. Jenn doesn't know a lot about cycling albeit that its something I do every day but Julie Allen (one of the co-owners with her husband Glenn) introduced herself and let Jenn know that she's always welcome, and even invited her to a Lady's Night there at the shop (There'll be food, speakers, prize drawings and the latest on all things bicycle related for the ladies). I don't mind plugging for this nice shop and their upcoming events...they're are simply great people to know on and off the bike and why wouldn't I support those who mean so much. I've seen it and heard that one shouldn't mix business with pleasure but in retrospect, I'd refer anyone to them or Bicycle Ranch, Loose Spokes (In Michigan) or Trek Bicycle Store of HIghland Park (Highland Park, IL) as I know the owners all very personally and these are some great bicycle shops to frequent!   The great thing about these places is that they all ride their bikes and can connect on every level. I was delved in the industry for quite some time and took some time off. As I write this I'm hydrating for my morning ride and looking forward to tomorrow as tomorrow is on its way. Its kind of hard to sleep with this sort of excitement looming on the horizon! After scheduling my fit Glenn and I shared a few good laughs and his passion for the bike which is wonderful. We both are about the same age and feel great getting out there day after day. Jenn's excited seeing me out there more so than usual but we both agreed that this would definitely be a great kickstart into cycling some more. Its a true joy seeing the owners and their staff smile and to see them take care of their customers. The selection of bicycles is astounding and the selection of food, clothing and accessories is awesome. After all was said and done, Glenn said "Welcome back to cycling John." Its a goal of mine to get back out there racing again (I still carry my Category 2 license with the USCF) and I'm looking forward to some fun times ahead! Thanks Tribe MultiSport! You folks are awesome!

My wife and I went here for our 1 Year Anniversary and needless to say she was pleasantly surprised. I've been to this location once before years ago but never Yelped about it and it was wonderful to go back. I had the unbelievable New York Pepper Steak there and my wife the Scottish Salmon. We had the garlic mashed potatoes and also the fresh broccoli as our sides. Our water Jerry really took good care of us from our beverages of choice to compliment our meals and my wife's salad was also very good. I ordered the shrimp cocktail and thankfully Jerry warned me about the straight up nosebleed horseradish! Jerry was just amazing. If you ever go to Mastro's be sure to ask for him, actually anyone there will do well, we just loved Jerry to pieces for everything. He was very down to earth and attentive. It was an extraordinary culinary experience and thanks to him, we had a celebration of flavors wetting our pallets.   Sadly though the night had to carry on and we were blessed with Matro's amazing Butter Cake after our entrees. I'm glad that we booked for 5pm because around 545 it really started to pack in. We felt we had the entire restaurant to ourselves for a while and just savored how fast the first year of our marriage went. My steak melted in my mouth and my wife's salmon was perfect. Oh and the shrimp cocktail? Well those prawns were by no means thin! LOL! They were a meal unto themselves! I can't say enough about this place.   We left happy and content and were more than happy to leave Jerry a substantial tip because he made us feel like family. The food could have been absolutely horrible, but because of this good man, he would have made a negative meal experience disappear. Yes, he was that good! He actually said goodbye and thanked us for being his guests. Classy. On Spot. Positive. Thank you so much Jerry and Mastro's we'll be back again another day soon! You made our Anniversary memorable!

Phoenix Comicon was amazing this past 2013 and being a first timer it was more than just an expo of characters. For me, it was that and an opportunity to celebrate something I'd never done before with my Bumblebee Camaro...Bumblebee was able to be celebrated as a pop movie icon. I happened to be invited to a nice weekend of this showcasing of talent and pop culture by some great people in TJ Vanderwerf and Mike from Madprops. Not only did I marvel at the costumes and aisles of toys and comics and paraphernalia but experience something different. My car was voted as fan favorite by the people there and took home an award as part of their first ever car show. Fans showcased their cars ranging from the Ghostbuster's Echo-1 to a Jurassic Park Movie Jeep and many others. It's humbling to win an award or be recognized by your peers.   But what makes me truly happy is when I see little ones come up to my car, or me and ask if they can have a picture taken with it or sit in Bumblebee. It makes me happy to know that someone like Bumblebee can be brought off the silver screen to them. Its almost an unheard of things these days but to bring nostalgia to the people, especially children is truly a delight. I've sen little ones start to cry their so happy to get a chance to see Bumblebee in person. I'm a 40 year old man, and it makes me sit back and watch with no pride at all but humility at the displays of gratitude.   Comicon is such an amazing event. Its growing which is always good and the Phoenix Convention Center has great amenities, accessibility and cleanliness. Plus the staff people are friendly, organized and very respectful. I can't wait to go back and be a part of this again. If you all want to see something a litle different from Superman to Batman to Charlie Brown to the Avengers and Star Wars, go to Comicon. You won't be disappointed!

I love this place. Reason being...Apple experts everywhere. Was in the market for a new Macbook Air and Melia took great care of me, and even surprised me with the discount I get from work which I had forgotten about altogether. Ooops. I definitely recommend going to see her and also getting AppleCare/ That's a great service, even if you have to call Apple for servicing on products. I have an all Apple household and it's worth the $. Superior products and customer service.   Now if my 3 week long wait for my iPhone 6 Plus was done like tomorrow I"d be happy as a clam!!! 5 Stars for sure!

Love this place...and I'm serious. I love it from the heart. I took my wife here for the second time last night and she and I look at going as a real treat and worth the drive from North Scottsdale. It is so good to experience this place and enjoy some nice music, great food and oh yes wine. The service and owners are truly classy people and I have known them for years. I have no problems recommending 5th and WIne and I'd go every day if I could. My wife had their salmon, which was incredible, and the settings was awesome. We love the eclectic look of the place and our server was really nice and perfect. When we left the owners took time out to thank us and then some. My goodness I wish more restaurants were like this. I really enjoy going here. Its got a great outside patio, has great music and I think I just may have to make this a regular thing! When I told my wife last night we're going to 5th and WIne she said one word: "AWESOME!"  That's what I love to hear. Bravo 5th and WIne! I really hope you're reading this. You all have made us feel more than just customers, you all make us feel like family, and its truly an honor to visit your fine establishment!

Jenn and I went to Wolfey's last night for the first time after thinking maybe we'd go to Sweet Tomatoes but we decided to give Wolfey's a shot. It was worth it. She loves the sports bar scene and so do I and they had just about every game on! Our server was just wonderful. She was very consistent and touched our table every few minutes and really took good care of us. Props to Wolfey's food too. It was wonderful. Jenn got a nice club sandwich and I got a flat iron steak. It was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. That's how I like my steaks from time to time. Oh and the prices were definitely on point. I really liked the potato chip and dip bites. For $3.95 you sure get a lot of them!   I definitely recommend this place. I love the history and wish Ron Wolf so much more than all the best. They are really really good and clean! Nice establishment. We'll be back for sure!

I've been wanting to go to iPic for a long time and from the outside its just an amazing looking venue. The price is up there and the reviews look great, but sadly my girlfriend and I couldn't get the seats for the movie we wanted and all the others were pretty much sold out too. We searched online last some more for open seating today but no can do. Sorry iPic, its just not in the cards for us.

Spinato's is one of my fav places. The service was excellent last week when we went with some friends from out of town, and they loved having our baby girl too and gave her a little shirt to wear. The food was vaporized in no time! I recommend trying their gluten free pizza. It really doesn't taste any different than other pizas I've had before. Really a top notch place. PLEASE check them out. Prices aren't too bad either and I can't wait to go again soon!

So the wife and baby and I went here last night and really enjoyed it. My steak..the rib eye....took me home back to how my dad used to grill them. And I miss my dad's cooking a lot. My wife got the salmon and the baby slept! She does that a lot! Service was exemplary. Our waiter was timely, respectful and was a pleasure. The establishment is great too. I'm looking forward to many more trips here in the future!

Really good food and great service! We liked this place a lot. Smiles all around. It was nice to be thanked by the owner and our baby was nicely accommodated too. We like places like this. My salad was perfect. The fried zucchini appetizer was just right. The apple pie drink is also best with their apple pie. You won't be disappointed!

Oh how I love this place! Such a great place for the family and it's kept clean by the staff there. Plus they do birthday parties, have a bounce house indoors and it's a real dream come true. My 15 month old loves this place. She has a lot of great choices and the owners have children too so they understand the needs of children and parents. There's a break area with a coffee maker and this new dad really appreciates that. Plus they have snacks and drinks available. If you like and share their page of Facebook you get a discount too. Did you want multiple days? You can buy day passes to this wonderful place. I honestly can't say enough good about this play place. It's always a joy to go to and see my daughter have fun. They're very sanitary and friendly. Please check them out!

I ate here a few weeks ago and it was an awesome surprise! The food...I inhaled it. Vaporized it. It's great for family and they have fountains the kiddos can splash and play in. Highly recommend and be ready to be surprised. It really is nicely done!
