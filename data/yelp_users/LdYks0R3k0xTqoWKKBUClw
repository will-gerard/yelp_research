If I could half a star I would.  Looks a bad corporate template of chipotle.  The chicken was dry and flavorless and the brown rice had no flavor.  If you want Mexican don't go here.

It's a bar that does Chinese food on the side.  Panda express has better food.  The good thing is that its open till 2am.

Excellent Pho.  I had the usual, spring rolls and Pho Thai.  The peanut sauce for the spring rolls was not the best.  The deep broth wasn't overpowered by the anise and came with lots greens, cilantro and green onions.  I'm going back.
