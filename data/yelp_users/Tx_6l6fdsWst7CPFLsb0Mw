Best Pizza in Arizona hands down. We love coming here. Get the Specialty Mamma Spinach Pizza and add sausage and jalapeño. Mmmmmm. A little more pricey but you can taste the quality. Both the thin crust and Sicilian crust are great. Less than a mile from home too! Just wish they delivered to our residence. Enjoy!

This location happens to be the closest to my office so I'm here quite a bit. Some of the staff are excellent. Some are terrible. Just pretty much on the efficiency side of things. My drink is usually wrong. Which it isn't difficult at all. Soy Pumpkin Spice Latté. The milk part is what gets screwed up. If you order breakfast, at least any time I've been there. I watch my sandwich or croissant get sent to the drive thru several times before they realize one is supposed to be for their customer standing inside the building. I get free drink coupons out of it but I think that is a pricey way to go about business?! Seems to take for-e-verrrrrr to get my food unless it's something from the grab-n-go area. Which that you pick up yourself lol. Anyway, all in all great quality coffee. Could use a little more accuracy in orders and food time. But other than that, it's a busy location so be prepared and Enjoy! :)

Pita Jungle has the best Jalapeño Hummus! Perfect for a date night and you get a decent sized glass of wine for the price. Never have really been disappointed with anything on the menu. Service is usually great as well. Pizzas, Mahi Mahi, Grilled Chicken, Soup, Shawarma, Hummus, Fruit Plate, Kobe Burgers....ALL amazing!

Tons of froyo options to choose from! Cheesecake is by far my favorite! Fun spot to have a nice little date or girl talk ;) definitely stop by this location by ASU if you haven't had the chance to yet.

Mine and my families favorite spot for brunch. Everything and I mean everything is amazing here! Sautées, Smoothies, Spicy Bloody Marys, Egg Bene's, Pancakes, French Toast, Salads, Soups.....everything on their menu. We tend to make this a frequent spot to grab a bite to eat. If you want to feel even more rewarded by your visit & paying the $2 to park per hour.....take a hike up A Mountain before you enjoy your meal. Nice views of Phoenix and an intense leg workout. Then amazing food! You gotta try it. :)
