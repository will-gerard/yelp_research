Very great price, but it is all cash. The soda doesn't have free refills, but the iced tea does!! They have a weekly rotation so there's a different special in addition to the always-popular sweet and sour pork every night. Definitely worth stopping by!

Not once, but twice I have had my tinted windows ruined here. The manager gave a routine speech the first time I was there and stupidly I continued to give them my business. There are small holes and scratches all over that require the interior to be completely retinted. When I brought the second occurrence to management, they did nothing to assist and proceeded to give me the same BS excuse. I paid for the 50 dollar plan for many months but will not be giving them another dime. If you value your car take it to a place that cleans their rags and gives top notch service!!!    And to clarify, I did not say you ripped my whole tint off, it has many small holes, requiring the tint to be replaced. But quite frankly I don't see a difference.
