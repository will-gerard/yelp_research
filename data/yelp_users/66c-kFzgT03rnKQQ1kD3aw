This venue is great for local musicians.  They have an awesome sound guy.  A back stage area for the bands.  Loading from the rear of the building.   And they pay pretty good too.  Very cool venue.

This place has awful service.  Awful, horrible, terrible service.  Every. Single. Time. We sit at a table or booth it takes 15-45 minutes between plates.  We still go because it's cheap and pretty good when you do get your order. We have found that sitting at the sushi bar  helps in getting your order all together.

Oh my god are you serious?? This is the worst sonic drive in in the United States.  Hands down.  Worst service every single time.  Every single time I come to this location I completely regret it. Unreal.

I have been coming to this Discount Tire company for years out of convenience. However I keep coming back because the customer service is awesome.  It sucks having to buy new tires and these guys know it.  I never have to haggle. I never feel cheated or taken advantage of. They know everybody wants and in most cases "need" a "deal". These guys will find one for you.  I brought my car in today and didn't even have to ask.  My tire was low but under warranty and didn't cost me anything.  I was in and out quick.  I highly recommend bringing your car here.

My band played at Crabby Don's  on a Saturday night and brought a good sized crowd to the venue.  Probably 65-70 people (which is a lot for a small dive). We showed up a little early to eat some food and have a few drinks. We opened a tab with our waitress and let her know that we would like to pay our tab with cash at the end of the evening.  She had no issue with this and we went on with our evening.  Overall our service was good.  When we received our bill at the end of the evening,  the waitress remembered and brought us our card as well.  We paid with cash and went home.  The few days later we see a charge for the total bill charged to our card.  When I called Crabby Don's  I was told there was nothing they could do.  At my next band practice I told my friends of this experience and was shocked to find out that they had also refused to pay any of the bands, saying we didn't bring enough people.  These people are crooks and thieves.  I am amazed they are still in business.  I will always tell working bands to stay away from this awful venue.

This place was worth the hype.  Excellent chicken and waffles.  Quick friendly staff.  My pink drank was always full and my server  Charrae asked several times if we were ok.

We waited 30 minutes to be seated because of our party of 4 adults and 3 children.  Fortunately we had a great server.  Unfortunately we waited over an hour for food that never showed up.  This was on a Saturday evening at 7 pm but this place was dead.  There were maybe 10-15 other tables in the whole restaurant. We left hungry.   Never coming back.

Pretty nice atmosphere.  Very nice waiting staff.  Food was ok.  We waited 40 minutes to get waters and chips and salsa.  Another 25 to have our order taken.  A family sitting next to us had received drinks but had waited 45 minutes and had not had order taken so they left.  We were pretty determined to eat there.  After we ate I had to track down a waiter so we could pay.  Maybe it was an off night but nobody who worked there seemed to know what was going on or how to get their job done.  I won't be returning.

I have been eating here regularly for several years.  This is my favorite place to get great Chinese food.  I have never had bad service.  My order is always freshly prepared and perfectly cooked.  I love Great Wok!

I went in this morning with the hopes of finding a Glock Grip Plug.  I was looked at like I was speaking another language.  I was then (for some unknown reason) handed a Glock Slide Stop Lever and was told it was a magazine release button. I was told I could drop magazines quicker with it.  I guess anybody can open a gun store.  Brilliant group of guys if you ask me.

I read somewhere recently that Habit burger grill was the new best burger chain in the United States.  Reading this I had to check it out for my self.  It was a very clean burger spot.  Nice, professional staff.  The burgers were good.  Very much like "5 Guys". Not as good as "In And Out" but still very good.  Sweet potato fries were excellent.  I will go back soon because as I left I saw they had tempura battered green beans that looked incredible.

What a great store! Fantastic service! Knowledgeable and friendly staff.   I have been here a couple times, they a huge inventory.  As far as I am concerned, this is the only store worth going to.

Everything was great! We were a little bummed about being told there was a 45min-1hr wait, but I think it bummed out a lot of people ahead of us so we were actually quickly seated.  Started with Cajun fries. We ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp and a pound of crab legs.  It all cost 48.00  Very messy, very spicy, and we left very full.  I can't wait to go back and try the fried shrimp po boy.
