We ordered some company shirts and hats from Psycho Jock. We wanted to change up our logo and have it embroidered on the shirts instead of silk screen,  The owner came to our business with a couple sample ideas and different color schemes and was very helpful. The shipping is fast and the order was correct. Prices are very fair and have a lot to choose from.

This car wash is close enough to my office to where I can drop it off, walk to work, and come back later to get it. I was there the other day and opted for "The Works" at a discounted price of $24.99. When I came to pick up my car I was not impressed. I really needed it vacuumed and there was still a lot of dog hair on the carpets... I could have done a better job myself. I understand pet hair is extremely hard to remove completely but the level of effort appeared low. The exterior was ok.. I'm normally not picky but if I am paying someone to wash my car they should take a little more pride in their work.

For a female who knows nothing about cars, I don't feel like they ripped me off or added any pressure. So I recommend it. They were very accommodating to my schedule considering their hours are identical to my work hours. Owner was very nice and very friendly. They did what they said they would do.

I gave this rating base solely on my customer service experience, the food here is very good....The last time I walked into Delux 2 Go to pick up my turkey burgers was so awkward I wanted to walk right back out.  Now that the 2go side of the restaurant is also seating there are more servers walking around and going behind the take out counter. On a semi-busy Friday evening I walked inside and over to the counter but no one was there... not a big deal, I'll wait. Most tables was occupied with diners so I was just sort of hanging out with nowhere to sit, smelling the food and craving mine. Two different servers walked though the doorway from the main restaurant into the 2go area -zooming right passed me to their tables without even looking in my direction.. and then back out again. I thought I could at least get a smile, a 'how are you?', a "someone will be with you shortly" Nothing! Then, a server walked behind the counter where I was waiting and started ringing up something on a register. He was looking down or passed me the entire time, avoided eye contact completely. It was so uncomfortable!!! I am literally standing a foot away from his face and he says nothing and will not look at me... I was so close to greeting HIM and asking why he was avoiding me but I held back. It was super strange and I really wish I would have said something instead of just writing about it.. but hey. By the way when the young man who was working the take out counter finally came over he was nice and helpful... But seriously Delux.. Say Hello to people! I understand you are not making any money off me by saying hi or looking in my direction but a little customer service is always appreciated.  I am truly posting this review with the hope that this situation will not happen to any other customers. I am not trying to rant or complain that I was invisible to at least 3 employees as I waited for about 5 minuets.... maybe a little...

I get my pedicures and manicures from Paulene's Nails 2-3 times a month! They are inexpensive, punctual, friendly, consistent and give great massages- I love the hot stone.

I was referred to 'Ohana by a friend and I am really glad I was. I've never been a huge fan of getting my hair done in Old Town because, to me, it screams over-priced and snooty, however 'Ohana is a clear cut exception to what one may envision about Scottsdale salons.  The relaxed environment and tropical theme put me at ease the moment I walked in the door. I appreciated the open space, not too crowded or overwhelming but instead inviting and cozy.  I was immediately greeted and signed in. I met the stylist, Erin, who is also an instructor (well worth the slightly higher price tag, by the way). We had a great consultation before she mixed my color. I am not an easy client when it comes to conveying what I want in a hair style but Erin was professional and sweet and asked all the right questions to put my mind at ease. After the coloring she washed my hair with the most ravishing scalp massage! Perfect way to end a long stressful day, but it didn't end there as she gave me a hand massage too! It was fantastic! The cut looks hot! I told Erin how I'm still trying to grow out my hair, and that whenever I get it trimmed its always so short and I wanted it to still resemble the length I had. She listened, and nailed it. My hair felt healthy and refreshed without chopping 2 inches of length off. She gave me some rock star fringe and I can't wait to go back!

I LOVE this place!!! I wanted a pedicure on my lunch break and I wasn't to thrilled with the place I normally go so I thought I would give First Nails and Spa a try. I wasn't expecting anything other than a average, yet pleasant experience, but little did I know this is now my favorite nail salon by far! I didn't have an apt (never do when getting peds) and it was pretty busy inside. They got me in quickly and I sat down on the massage chair. I was given a menu with a variety of services. I initially found the menu slightly confusing because a lot of the packages have only minor differences, but I was so impressed with the prices considering everything you get, and the massages can be up to 50 mins! I chose the reflexology package thinking that I would get a reflexology rub during my pedicure but, it turned out even better! While I was waiting for the lady to finish up with the last customer another employee came over to do my 40 min reflexology massage. It was amazing. The pedicure was great too and they still massaged my feet PLUS my hands and arms --even though I didn't get a manicure.      The second time I went I didn't have as much time so I chose a basic pedicure with callus removal. Once again, as I was waiting for the pedicure to start an employee came over and started massaging my hands and arms. I loved it! I thought I received the extra massage last time because I was getting additional services, but the arm/hand massage is standard! I love that in a nail salon! But, as most walk in nail salons they prefer cash but they do have cash discounts on just about every service, so that's super cool!

Garlic Naan!!! So GOOD!!!! Loved the food... I was actually expecting a dinner buffet...don't know where I got that idea but the buffet is only during lunch time apparently. Anyway, I stayed and dined in for dinner...I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere but the food and service trumped it. Definitely recommend India Garden and I want to try the lunch buffet soon.

I went to Barrio Queen on New Years and I was very impressed. The manager made an effort to come to our table and inform us to think of the menu as "sushi". Strange--- I know, but it makes sense. The entrees are small and you can order one or two to start and then move on from there... The tacos are delicious! Its actually comforting, in my opinion, to go to a mexican restaurant and know that you are not going to be served these extreme portions nor leave stuffed and ready to explode. If you like fish tacos, try the dos xx battered pescado tacos. So good!
