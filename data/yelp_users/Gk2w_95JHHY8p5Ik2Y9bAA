Just had the "death wobble" fixed on my jeep. All staff was super knowledgeable, extremely courteous and the price for the new part and labor was most reasonable. I will definitely be back with any other vehicles.   Overall, great prompt service, great prices, and awesome staff. Will be back for sure.  Thanks ATD!!

Best ribs. Pecan coleslaw is to die for as well. This is where I always come if I want unparalleled too quality BBQ. Service and staff are always on point and friendly. I usually go for the platter and get a little of everything.

Always fresh. The happy hour is great with a decent selection off apps, rolls, beer, and sake all around $5. I usually get a roll or 2 on HH but then have to always get some ala carte nigiri. The halibut, salmon, and yellowtail belly are all great. Being just down the street for me it's a no brainier.

So just stopped in while I was getting my car worked on. I went with the 1/2 rack ribs, slaw, and tater salad. Not impressed.   When I asked for a good recommendation the counter guy just told me "everything is good." Not really what I was looking for...   The ribs were just ok, much fattier than most, the potato salad was runny and just had too much sauce. Slaw was pretty good.   Overall it was ok for a quick stop to fill up, I just probably won't be back especially since I spent $20 for mediocre BBQ. Bobby Q is where I'll be next time I'm looking for great BBQ.
