Great service and fast. The Assistant Mngr Anthony took great care of my wife's car and provided a great customer experience. He didn't try to push things on me.

I drive all the way from North Phoenix to keep coming to them. Great family who takes great care of their customers and gets to know each one.

My daughter went with her grandmother and grandfather to this restaurant. I am appalled at the experience my little girl had. My in-laws are a inter-racial couple, and were treated so badly because of that. They were sat at a table, no one came to help them. Another couple was sat next to them, they had their order and drinks brought right away. My in-laws still have not been greeted, then when they said something and they asked for a manager the hostess brought a waitress. The waitress had an attitude and said "I guess I can help you, what do you want?". When they tried to leave the manager came out and comped them their starter but sat them away from all other customers so they couldn't be heard if complaining.  This is outrageous! In 2015, in Arizona we have to worry about my daughter learning about racism at such a young age. A black man and white woman cannot be served like everyone else? I will never eat here and I hope no one else does either. An establishment like this should not be allowed to be in business.

When my wife and I bought our new home we had a baby girl on the way, so great security, monitoring and cost was a huge priority. After doing our research and through recommendations we went through Jon Knox, owner of Knox Security Services Inc. We didn't want to go through ADT, their monitoring was too high and we had them in a prior house. ADT outsources their service reps and the quality of work was sub par. Our house almost caught fire because of an incorrect mini transformer installed by a former rep. When the out sourced rep came out he tried to sell us over priced window sensors under the table.  When Jon came to see our home he installed everything quickly and was easy to get in touch with when we had some questions. The quality of work, installation and equipment blew ADT out of the water. After getting to know him I could tell he does some very impressive work for very large homes and businesses. Even though I was a smaller job, he made me feel important and like I was his top priority. Not bad to get that sort of treatment from the owner of a company! Ever since we have had the alarm installed we haven't had a single issue and feel comfortable that our home and new family member are safe.   I highly recommend Knox Security Services Inc. for anyone considering a home security system and didn't want to go through ADT like my wife and I.
