Ok...I must admit I have always been a bit skeptical of Chiropractors just having limited personal experience.  That said, I was so impressed with Dr. Alicia Myers this morning in a post accident visit. Her level of professionalism and expertise was so impressive and demeanor and humor made for a great experience. I'm so impressed!

This place is closed.  I know it wasn't trendy and some may be surprised that it was still around but it was a great place with good food, nice service and an all night Happy Hour...it will be missed!

This new place is great and overlooking the Scottsdale Greenbelt it fits so nicely into its location...calling it a coffee shop would be selling it short...yes that have great coffee and roast their own beans but the food is also great!...just had one of the best egg white, spinach and feta omelette a ever...they also just got their liquor license and are expanding their menu and hours...

Great place for beer and wine.  Went on a Sunday that was pretty quiet having come from the energy of The Vig...There are classic games to play like Rock Them Sock Them Robots And Mr Bill Service on that day was so subpar not sure if I will be back.  The bartender had Zero personality (I admit I can be a smart ass) and wasn't very attentive
