If you are not into the "scene" at the gym and you really just want to get your workout on, this is a great gym.  You'll typically see mid 30's types on up so if you're trying to check out the 20 something hotties, you might want to head over to Lifetime Fitness or another sexy gym.  Sometimes I feel young at this gym and I'm 39...makes me like it even more!  While Fitness Forum isn't too sexy, it has it all.  They have an indoor pool, all the treadmills, ellipticals, weights and other stuff you would expect AND classes for free.  It's around $29 a month and there is never a big crowd there, so no waiting for a machine, etc.

We frequent this location, as it's nearest to our house.  I do agree with other reviews that it's slloooooowwww to check out here.  However, when you do interact with an employee here, all of the employees are very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.  One employee who has helped us quite a bit is Jim.  He's always super helpful, but he can get a bit disheveled when things get busy in there.  Nonetheless, Jim goes above and beyond to ensure you are doing the right thing for your pool and helps in any way he can.  Overall, a decent place to get your pool chemicals, water tested or buy some new floaties.

Hadn't been here in about a year. Now I remember why. Food is nothing special. They used to have really good carne asada tacos and pork medallions on menu over a year ago. Have tried a few menu items since then and always a bit disappointing.  I like the ambience and the staff are always friendly.  Won't be back anytime soon because the food is not that good,  unfortunately.  They need new food items on the menu.

DO NOT go here!!  So I hadn't been to the Mill Ave new location, although I do frequent the location on Elliot.  A colleague of mine and I decided to take 2 external customers with us to this restaurant, as we have been fans of the food and service on Elliot.  NOT THIS LOCATION!!!  Probably one of the worst dining experiences in my life.  I was so embarrassed we took others here, too.    So, we arrive, after making a reservation for 4.  We are promptly seated (the only good thing that happened all night) and after sitting there for about 2 min. I realize it's hotter in the restaurant than outside where it's 108 degrees today!  The 2 guys we brought are in suits and ties and begin sweating bullets.  We sit there for almost 15 min with nobody even acknowledging our presence.  Finally, we flag down a server and ask her who OUR server is.  5 min later a girl, with no urgency or desire to please us, arrives.  We ask her why it's so hot and she says, "Yeah...our AC is broken.  It will be fixed tomorrow".  OK, WELL WHY THE HECK DIDN'T YOU TELL US THAT WHEN WE CALLED TODAY AND MADE A RESERVATION?!!!  So, our guests from San Diego, about to pass out, are patient and kind and didn't say a negative word.  Took another 8 min to get ice water...oh wait...warm water!!!  Ice was all melted.  3 of the group order a cocktail.  The beer our guest wanted she said they were out of, so he couldn't get that beer.  Then, 10 min after we ordered the drinks (and still haven't gotten them!!) she comes back to the table, without any drinks, and tells my colleague they are out of the wine she wants.  OUTRAGEOUS!!!  Finally, I get my iced tea...no ice, no straw, no sweetener.  I didn't even bother asking for anything because it was pointless.  We order the food and wait and wait and wait....all while our drinks are empty and without ice.  We waited about 45 min for the food and finally had to flag down the server (because of course she's nowhere to be found!!) and ask her when the food was coming out.  Immediately after that, it came out.  Food was so so.  I ordered the halibut.  It was somewhat dry.  Not sure how the other food was but everyone just wanted to get out of the hell, literally (because of the heat!) we were in.  After just spending a few min reading reviews on this place, I'm even MORE angry (which I didn't think possible)!  It appears that you are supposed to get bread before you meal.  Guess what?  We didn't even get offered any.  I know that's shocking.  I really cannot say enough bad things about this place and our experience.  You would think with the AC out, they would at LEAST tell you, as you walk in and then even offer a cocktail or COLD (that means, with ice) beverage on the house.  They need a serious lesson in customer service at this Cafe Boa.  I can help, if they want.  :-)  Email me.

I've been going to Altered Ego for 5+ years now and cannot say enough good things about the place, especially Terri who does my color/cut each time.  It's a great salon and Terri makes my hair look great.  Ask for her!  They are a full salon with tanning, nails and even a daycare for kids while the parent(s) get beautiful.  They are attached to a coffee shop next door and so you can order a coffee and they'll even deliver it over to you at your hair station.  Altered Ego has great staff and I recommend it!

CASINO REVIEW:    So I was in Vegas on a girl's weekend and we decided to do a "white trash" casino tour on Saturday.  This was our last stop on the tour.  We decided to go here after our cab driver who drove us from the airport to our hotel had said it was a great place for the locals to hang out.  If that's true, I feel kinda bad for the Vegas locals because there has to be a better place for them!  The place was small, smoky and didn't win on the tables or slots.  Not to mention that some of the "locals" that hang ou there looked like they might be homeless.  We did figure for our several hundred dollars in losses we may as well get a free tshirt and hat for signing up for the Player's Club, so that was fun.  Not that we will ever use the Player's Club card again, however!    After a few hours of attempting to win big and just continuing to lose bigger, we headed out front and were surprised there were no taxis anywhere to be found.  We waited it out for a bit, waiting and waiting...  So, we decided to walk across the street to see if we could hail a taxi from the other side of the road.  That's when we realized we could be in danger!  Scary part of town, 2 blonde women walking alone....lots of homeless folks and "locals" that were packing heat, I'm sure.  Still no taxi and now we're hot (it's about 110 degrees out at 10:30 at night) so we stop at the convenience store to grab a bottle of water.  Well, we were the only ones drinking water there.  Everyone else had a 40 in a paper bag in their hand!  Had to tip the "local" for holding the door open for me (didn't "have" to, but was scared not to when they asked me for a tip for holding the door...).  We proceeded down the road and saw a taxi that was available at the stop light.  We get the driver's attention, he rolls down the window and says, "where you going?".  I tell him, "The Palazzo".  He immediately yells "NO!" and rolls the window up.  WHAT?!!  So we continue walking....now the pathway is getting darker, even though I can see the lights of the strip ahead (but further away than they appear, I might warn you all...) and the walk is really starting to freak us out.  I actually grabbed my money and wallet from my purse and shoved them in my bra, at this point, scared we were about to be mugged!!  We did finally safely make it back to tourist land on the strip and were relieved.    I'd sum up the whole experience in one word:  TERRIBLE.

As a Diamond card holder of the Total Rewards program with Harrah's, I get lots of offers for free rooms in Vegas, including Paris.  I love to stay here and it always feels like "home" for me on the strip.  Love the location and the service is always consistently good.  I especially like that this casino is not HUGE, but just big enough (as compared to Ceasar's where I find myself wandering in circles at night looking for the right tower and elevator to just get to bed!  Wait...maybe that has something to do with 12 hours of consistent drinking....hmmm...ok, well...).  I love the red rooms at Paris and have also stayed in the Penthouse suite a few years ago (which was a nice treat and a comp upgrade).  The Diamond Lounge is nice because it's easily accessible and they have hot apps in the afternoon and always free cocktails.    I'll sum it up with:  Le Paris est magnifique!

While I have never bought anything here, I have consigned clothing and shoes here several times.  I use this as my "fun fund" by always stopping by here with my clothes before I head off to donate them.  They tend to only take designer/brand name stuff, which makes sense.  You drop off your stuff, they look through it and tell you how many items they want to keep to sell, hand you a receipt and then come back a few months later (maybe sooner...depends) and pick up cash.  Gotta love it.  They are friendly and seems to be a well run store.

Since we live near Chandler Mall, this happens to be one place we frequent about once a week....sometimes more (ok, we eat out a LOT!).  I have never had a bad meal here.  The place has a great wood smoked smell inside and it's a bit dark inside, which I kind of like and provides a nice atmosphere.  They have an open kitchen so you know your food hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 min.  During the winter, the bar inside is great, as it has a huge fireplace and an inviting atmosphere to partake in some cocktails.  The outdoor patio also has a fireplace and a great place to sit when it's not too hot.    So what should you order there?  Here are my favorites, depending on your mood:  The filet wrapped in bacon is a delicious staple at Firebirds.  The meat is tender and always cooked perfectly (I like mine medium rare +).  Wood grilled salmon - some of the best salmon I have had!  LOVE the flavor of the wood.  Ahi tuna appetizer - if you're going light and like ahi, I highly recommend this from the starter menu.  The mustard sauce they serve with it has a mighty big kick and is one of my favorites.  I've tried to recreate it at home, without success.   Green beans as a side option - ohhhh I know what you are thinking!!  Green beans? Yuck.  I'll get something else.  Well, everything is good but the green beans are the BEST!  They are sauteed with pecans and a little butter and they are soooo delicious.  You won't know it's a veggie!!   As far as a chain restaurant goes, this is a top pick for me.  Check it out!!  You can't go wrong.

Am a fan of Picasso's.  We go there probably close to at least 1-2 times a week and they notice that when we visit each time.  I almost always get the berrylicious salad with chicken.  The chicken is so yummy, but the feta and glazed walnuts, with the strawberries mixed in, makes it the best.  Have had the pizza and some other pastas, too, which are also very delicious.  The prices have gone up with their menu changes, but we're willing to pay for the organic meats, etc.  Definitely a place to check out if you are in the mood for some pizza!

This is a review of the casino & gambling experience (not the hotel).  We made our way over to Bill's, as we walked the strip in Vegas.  I had been there before, but only briefly.  My husand and I were doing some Saturday day gambling and had  already lost a few hundred the night before so were hopeful we could find a $5 blackjack table.  Found out that O'Shea's (our normal white trash place that we love) was closed for renovation and I think we found the next best thing when we found Bill's Gamblin Hall & Saloon!!  The dealers are all very helpful and friendly and the cocktail waitresses come around very frequently, which doesn't happen in most casinos.  Also, they have Miller Lite on draft (my fav!).  They have several $5 tables, including blackjack and World Series of Poker.  We gambled and drank here most of the day Saturday and were sad to have to leave when we found out we had a dinner resv.  But probably good that we did because we left with more $$ than we came into Bill's with.  I recommend Bill's if you are looking for a casual, inexpensive place to gamble.

Ahhhhh the Palazzo.  The smell, the slight hum of slot machines in the background.....LOVE it.  This is by far my favorite place to stay in Vegas.    I am a player here (not THAT kind of player....come on now) and used to get quite a few comp offers to stay at Palazzo.  According to my favorite bartender who makes me the BEST cosmos at the center bar next to the gift shop, the players club "scaled back" on comp offers a bit ago.  That was unfortunately because I don't ever pay for a hotel room in Vegas and had to go elsewhere where I was offered comps.  The suites are just so much nicer and larger than your "traditional" Vegas room.  Love the decor and everything about it.  Well, I'm happy to say that I have a comp for this 4th of July weekend at Palazzo and will be staying at Palazzo the next 3 days.  I plan on my regular "circuit" while there: Check in and sniff up the Palazzo aroma in the air, stop by the center bar for cosmo on way to room, immediately head back down and hit the tables, head up to floor 23 for some afternoon cocktails/apps around 5ish and then finish up the night gamblling and having fun.  Next day:  cocktails by pool and soaking up the Las Vegas sunshine, while wearing SPF 100.  Now THAT's a great weekend.

Forget the hassle of Fry's or Safeway....Fresh and Easy is so convenient, inexpensive and has almost everything!  I hate grocery shopping, but I love going to Fresh and Easy.  They have great fresh fruits, veggies and meats.  You can get in and out quickly and avoid the big, full parking lots and long lines.  This is the perfect store for singles our couples because a lot of the foods come in single/double servings.  LOVE IT!!

So I found Duane on yelp, when I needed a handyman for a rental property I own.  He had good ratings and so I reached out.  He picked up the phone (didn't have to leave a vm) and was very friendly.  I explained the issue w/ the broken toilet and he let me know that he would call me back, same day, to see when he would be able to go out there.  Said it would be $75-$100 + parts.  We agreed on that.  He followed through on calling me back and let me know he could come on Monday (this was on a Thu), which was fine for the renter and me.  Sight unseen, but he showed up on time and when I texted him to ask him about it he said the cost was only $40 total.  That was much less than the originally quoted price so I was pleasantly surprised.  He also was able to invoice me so the renter didn't have to pay out of pocket and he let me know he was not able to take a credit card (yet...).  All in all, very good experiene and I would recommend him.

We frequent Sauce a few times a month and love their gluten free and thin crust pizza, as well as their salads.  Its convenient, relatively quick and close to our house, making it a good option for us.    The one thing we have noticed that is really irritating with Sauce is they are almost "too" eager to take away your plates as you finish your meal.  This is a place where you order, get a number and then they deliver your food to you, so not a sit down restaurant with a server.  I will have barely finished putting the fork in my mouth for my last bite of food and here comes the 17 year old kid to ask me if he can take my plate. I'm still chewing my last bit and here he comes.... This always happens!  It's like they are watching from the back and having a contest between the teenagers that work there of who can get to the tables and remove the dishes the fastest.  While it's nice they want to remove the dirty dishes, it becomes annoying because they do this for every dish on your table as you finish, interrupting your meal several times.  They also tend to send the teenage workers around to ask how your meal is tasting a bit too much, as well.  I told 4 people the food tasted "fine", "great", "very delicious" the other evening when we were there.  It's making me want to get the food to go ALWAYS.  Hey, wait a minute!  Maybe that's Sauce's strategy all along and it finally worked with us.  Hmmm.

Been here a total of 3 times now.  As they say, three strikes and you're out!  Verona Chophouse is definitely OUT after my third visit for dinner last night!  I'm sad to say that, but 2 bad visits of 3 visits ends in NO WAY will I return again.  So, as a frequent visitor to Lone Butte Casino and Wild Horse Pass, they are kind enough to give me perks to come back to the casino (imagine that!).  One of the perks I get each month is $100 or so to spend on restaurants/food in the casino.  So, my fiancee and I decided to head out to Verona Chophouse a few different times, which I'll summarize here with the approx dates and experience we had on the 3 visits.    1st visit - Went for dinner.  Food was so-so.  Service was horrible (soooo slow) and atmosphere was nothing to comment on.  2nd visit - June 2011  Food was REALLY good.  Had the filet mignon and my fiancee had the chicken parm.  Both were tasty.  The filet was juicy and soooo tender.  Chicken parm was a large portion and delicious.  Service was better than 1st visit (not spectacular, but not bad...) and we were given new hope that this could be a great place for us to eat, near home.  Also, there was a piano player and a singer there for a great ambience.  3rd visit - Aug 2011  Went at 6PM and asked for a table for two.  Was told by the hostess that there was a 20 min wait.  No problem.  More gambling!  We came back 20 min later and were quickly seated, with the hostess telling us the waitress was REALLY busy delivering some food and other things and would be a few min.  About 5 minutes later, while reviewing the menu, the water/buser guy comes by to ask what we want to drink and tells us the waitress is delayed and very busy.  Next up the manager comes by to tell us the same thing.  Um, now we are getting worried and looking around to discover how there was a 20 min wait when the place is empty??!  There were a total of 8 tables with customers and the rest empty.  We chalked it up to it must be they don't have enough servers.  We finally meet our poor waitress.  She was a bit on edge and stressed and I kinda felt bad for her.  At a few times I actually saw her RUNNING through the restaurant to get to the back and run a credit card, pick up food, etc.  So, we ordered fried mozzarella and crab stuffed mushrooms as appetizers.  I ordered the filet again because the 2nd visit here it was so yummy!  My fiancee ordered penne pasta with chicken and broccoli, but asked for no broccoli.  We wait about 10 min and then our waitress comes by to ask if we want our salads first because the mushrooms take longer to cook.  We said that's fine and so shortly after that, we got our salads (I had the house salad, fiancee had the ceasar).  Both salads were pretty tasty and probably the best part of the meal.  Appetizers come out 10-15 min later.  The mushrooms were not fully cooked and were nothing special.  I really think they were frozen pre-bought from Costco that they baked in the oven.  My fiancee said the fried mozzarella tasted like fish, but I didn't taste any, so not sure.  Maybe they used a fish fryer for them?  Waiting..waiting...waiting for food.  Meanwhile, another table of 2 gets seated in our waitresses section.  She keeps walking by to serve them and telling us that it will be just a little longer as they are waiting on the filet.  About 10 min later (now about an hour into dinner...way too long for this dead place!) our food entrees arrive.  Looks like my fiancees meal is the wrong order and she confirms it is!  She did admit it was her own error and she put in the wrong order.  So now he's left returning his entree to wait another 10+ minutes for the correct entree.  Meanwhile, I'm anxiously awaiting my first bit of filet.  Blech.  It was overcharred on one side (which the chef hid by placing that side on the plate so you couldn't see it!) and had no flavor.  The broccolini was cold and what were supposed to be potato fingerlings appeared to be rocks.  Seriously.  Now she brings out the correct entree for my fiancee.  We know that the check is going to take 30 min for her to produce, given our experience thus far, so we ask for the check and tell her we are using the casino vouchers I get, as a perk.  She comes back about 10 min later and says she needs to check on something with the vouchers and should just be a minute.  10 more min later the manager (who was doing NOTHING but yelling at everyone during this whole dining experience...shouldn't she be running food and actually helping them??!!) came by to see if we needed anything.  Luckily, we didn't answer what we wanted to say!!  Told her we needed the vouchers done so we could leave.  Said it will be just another min.  The waitress returns 3-4 min later and says we're good to go.  THANK GAWD!!   So, third time was not a charm and neither is Verona Chophouse.  Even if it's FREE (like our meal was) it's not worth the time or effort!  Keep gambling but don't eat here.

Ok, I have to hand it to Verona.  I said I would NEVER go back to this place after I went there several times in 2011 and it was awful service and food.  However, it appears they DID make some significant changes that cause me to update and upgrade my review since the last one (1 star on 8/15/11).  Plus, my friend had said that the place was pretty good now and convinced me to give it another try.   Had dinner here last night with a girlfriend and we sat at the bar.  Ordered a great bottle of pinot noir and then ordered dinner.  We both started with the house salad - delicious.  Goat cheese, greens and a great dressing that was light.  I had the chicken parmesan and she had the filet.  Both were amazing!!  The filet was huge and melted in your mouth.  The chicken parmesan was also a big serving but YUMMMMY!  The best part is we were able to use mostly comps to pay for it all, making it even better - FREE.  Nicely done, Verona.  I will be back.

Needed a gas dryer disconnected and a new one hooked up.  It's not a tough job, but you don't mess with gas unless you are really brave.  I'm only a bit brave, apparently!  And I kinda like our house and don't want to blow it up.  Saw that this company got positive reviews on yelp, so I called on a Tue and they sent someone out the next day.  They called me to let me know they had a cancellation and asked if they could come earlier than the schedule time, which worked great.  Service guy was super friendly and did a good job.  I used the $30 off coupon from yelp and the price was $117 for this job, which I think is slightly high, but based on the quick service and efficiency, I would recommend them.

Anyone who knows me, knows I love me a good game of blackjack!  So, the Wild Horse Pass is usually my casino of choice on weekends when I  partake in such activities.  The dealers are friendly, the casino is like a mini Vegas and it's just so much fun.  Ling and Louie's restaurant has great food, as does Shula's (but a lot pricier!) steakhouse.  They also have a nice lounge for Platinum players where you can get appetizers and free cocktails.  Gotta love that!  I've stayed here overnight once or twice and the rooms are brand new and quite comfortable.  Double down on Wild Horse!

Ling & Louie's is a favorite place for me when at Wild Horse Pass doing some gambling.  I have had the ahi tuna, the firecracker shrimp and the orange chicken and all were delicious.  The service can be a bit slow at times, but always friendly and the food is always hot and fresh.  The fried rice (it's an upgrade...go for it...double down!) is worth it.  Soooo yummy.  And the food always tastes better if you can get it comped from your casino host.  :-)

On average, I go here MINIMUM 1X a week....already been there 2X in the last 3 days, so that tells you what a regular I am.  Have met the owner multiple times and he's super friendly and always remembers us.  They change flavors regularly and the flavors are SOOO yummy.  You can even get ones with no sugar in them that are delicious (chocolate dipped strawberries...had it tonight...great!).  Their website has all of the weight watchers points, too, which is kind of nice.  Their toppings are the best - fresh fruits AND some of your standard stuff (M&M's, cookie dough, sprinkles, etc.).  Great ambience and the teenagers that work there are always friendly.  Glad to have Yo Love in our neighborhood!!

Hadn't stopped in to Yo Love for a while so we decided to go in for some pumpkin pie and vanilla yogurt after dinner the other night.  I don't know if they have changed their recipe or if it was an "off" night, but the yogurt was icy and so bad.  I remember that when Yo Love first opened the owner explained how/why their yogurt recipe was different and that it was always creamy and never icy like the competitors.  So something has changed....  And for 2 yogurts it was almost $12 and we didn't really load them up or do anything crazy.

Oregano's is within walking distance to our house and so it's a weekly staple for us.  Surprisingly, we don't go for the pizza!  We go for the salads.  Yep, you can eat healthy here (although I must admit...the garlic cheese bread and pastas surrounding you will make it difficult and call your name, tempting you to order them or reach over and steal a bite of someone's food!).  I think we have actually only sat at a table one time.  We always scoot on up to the bar to eat.  No wait, friendly bartenders and fast service right there next to soooo many good beers on tap.  The Oregano's favorite is MY favorite salad.  I always get it with chicken.  Hubby likes the classic chicken ceasar salad.  Both are always made fresh and not sure what they do to the chicken, but it melts in your mouth and is soooo delicious.    Occasionally we will "splurge" and eat something outside the salad "zone".  If/when you do that, go for the garlic cheese bread with marinara sauce.  I could eat 10 of those in one sitting (even though it would be "carbocide" - hahahaaha!!).  The pizza is pretty good but I find it very salty.  The wings (on the appetizer menu) are also delicious and I love that all of them are drumsticks, so you never get ripped off with the little wings that other places seem to give you more of.  All drummies here!    Everyone here is friendly and it's a must go when in Chandler.  Keep up the good work, Oregano's.

I'm a cupcake snob and believe MY cupcakes are the best.  But when this lady is tired and not in the mood to bake, she buys her cupcakes!!  I have tried a few other cupcake joints in the valley, but nothing that has really won me over like Sweet Daddy Cucpakes!  Bought a dozen ($32 I believe was the price - not bad) since we were celebrating a friend's birthday.  I purchased almost every flavor they had.  WOW!  They were delicious.  Moist, flavorful and not too much frosting like some places.  The oreo cookie cupcake was AMAZING and not to mention the carrot cake!  The Doodah (white funfetti with sprinkles and white frosting) was good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  I was warned before I bought that kind, but wanted to try it anyway.  I will definitely be back to this place!

We had been here a few times before, as we like to gamble at Harrah's every once in a  while, but it had been a few years since our last visit to eat at the Range.  Decided to go on a Friday evening, play some blackjack, win some money and have a great steak dinner.  Well, none of that really happened since we lost at blackjack (which has nothing to do with this review...in case you're wondering if I'm a bitter loser.  HA!)  and the steak dinner was definitely not great!    Made a resv online for the two of us from the Harrah's site using open table (very easy and good feature).  Had a booth in the back by the kitchen, which was a noisy spot but not too horrible.  Our server Jodi was friendly and very attentive throughout the meal.   We both ordered the 8 oz filet ($36 each - pricey!).  I chose mine with blue cheese crumbles on top and my husband ordered his without any topper.  Hubby got steak fries and mac and cheese as sides.  I chose mushrooms/onions and a loaded baked potato.  To start, I had a spinach salad that had walnuts and bacon in it with some sort of white cheese - delicious - and I think this was probably my favorite part of the meal.  Hubby had a house salad - meh.  The breads are fresh and quite good!  Main entrees arrived and server asked us to cut into them right away to be sure they looked ok in terms of how we ordered them (medium and medium "warm").  They were fine.  What wasn't fine was the taste of the filets!  I'm not sure how they cook them here (broiled?  Saucepan?), but they really had no flavor and were kind of blah.  We are used to great steaks that are grilled (Firebirds in Chandler has the best!).  I was glad I had ordered blue cheese crumbles on my steak or it would've had NO flavor.  I probably only ate 1/2 of my steak.  Steak fries were not traditional looking and hubby said they were "ok".  I did try the mac and cheese and it was pretty good!  The loaded baked potato comes with small portions of sour cream, butter, cheese and chives all on the side on this little plate that had 4 divided sections.  The cheese was hard like it had been sitting out on the side plate for hours.  Am assuming they prep many of these side plates for baked potatoes earlier in the day.  My onions and mushrooms were soggy and I didn't care for them.  We did not order dessert (too full from breads and salad!).  Bill was $86 for the 2 of us.  Used my Total Rewards points to pay for it.  And THAT is the only winning moment of the entire evening!  :-)

I was really amped up and ready for the best steak and meal of my life, based on the reviews from yelp I had seen and because well, it's Gordon Ramsay!  Sadly, was disappointed and won't be returning here.  Tried to get reservations about a week in advance, but all they had was 10PM or later.  Considering we sometimes can be passed out in bed at that time in Vegas (depending on how the day drinking goes), we decided to risk it and opt to see if we could get a table in the lounge right at the opening time.  Well, it worked!!  We were able to get in right around 6PM when we walked up and needed a table for 4.    The atmosphere was pretty nice.  Great decor and the tables had this cool light on them.  Waitresses wear these sexy sequined short dresses, which made for good conversation and eye candy for the men.  I ordered a blueberry vodka and club soda, which was delicious.  The other 3 in my party didn't order anything to drink (husband was already drunk and the other couple don't really drink much).  However, looked like they had a great wine selection and they give it to you on an ipad, which was cool.  As for what we ordered....my husband and the other guy with us both ordered the kobe steak, I ordered the salmon, my friend ordered the seafood platter.  For starters, I got the salad and one other person got the shrimp cocktail.  They were both fine.  Nothing to rave about and not disappointed there, really.    Then the food came out.  So my salmon was barely lukewarm in the center and had NO flavor whatsoever.  I ordered mushrooms on the side and they were "ok".  My husband's kobe steak (which was $80, I do believe!!) was "ok".  It was rarer than "medium" which was how he ordered it, but didn't want to send it back given the crowd and how long it might take.  It was good (I tried it), so don't get me wrong.  But I've had better steaks that were 1/2 the price.  He ordered the mashed potatotes on the side which were really delicious!  Go for it!  I would say the salmon was on the list of bottom 10 salmon dishes I have ever tried.  Maybe it was an "off" night or something for that dish.  I know they are known for the steaks, but....  Also, I don't even think the waitress ever came back and asked how the food tasted, or we might have told her some of this feedback.  Maybe she didn't ask because she knew.  haha  The total bill was $425 for 4 of us (I had one cocktail and nobody else drank, so this was truly all food..no dessert for anyone either!)  Very pricey for "so so" food, in my opinion.  We have a chain restaurant called "Firebirds" here that I would go to everyday for steak and/or salmon before I went to Gordon Ramsay's.  Even if they were the same price I'd still choose Firebirds.  Hopefully Gordon goes to his restaurant and experiences the place like we did. Then he'll yell at the chef and things will change for the better.  :-)

I feel sorry for Texans if they think THIS is good BBQ!  Go to Joe's BBQ in Gilbert.  We were excited to try a new BBQ joint closer to our house since we normally go to Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert..  Now listen fellow yelpers, you have never steered me wrong.  So I was convinced this was going to be good, after reading all of the rave reviews and seeing a 4 start avg for this place.  I cannot say that I agree with the good reviews of this place at all.  We arrived at 5:45 PM on a Sunday eve and were cheerfully greeted by a young lady who helped us figure out how it worked.  You grab a bottled beer or soda (or they have cups where you order for fountain drinks) and then order at the counter.  No line and we got up to the counter and I decided on the moist brisket, given the good reviews I had read on here.  I watched them cut it up and throw it onto some wax paper and put it in our feeding trough (some crazy basket that they put all of your food into, as there are no trays or plates!).  I decided on beans and creamed corn and then the guy asked if I wanted white or wheat bread. I chose white and he slapped 5 pieces of Wonder bread into the trough.  I don't get the bread part and they give you way too much.  Off we went with our basket of food and we found a picnic table to sit at where we didn't have to eat with strangers at one of the other long 20 person tables, like on a cruise ship!  We then checked out the condiments and I grabbed a paper container filled with pickles.  Had both the sissy BBQ sauce and the hotter one and they both were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  The creamed corn looked and tasted like someone just took corn niblets from a can and put it into some cream.  It was not tasty at all.  The beans were not bad.  But the moist brisket....it was moist alright - it was oozing fat!  I think 50% of the meat was fat.  I was somewhat disgusted.  My husband had the same thing and he did not like it either.  Luckily, he had chosen Lay's BBQ chips for his side. Cannot go wrong there!!  Pretty sad when the best part of your meal is a bag of Lay's BBQ potato chips.    I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back "ya'all".

I would recommend these guys!  Called on a Monday morning at 9:30 AM to inquire about removing a wasp nest in the front of our house.  David answered the phone and told me they had a guy out in our area that would be at our house by 11:30 AM.  Indeed he was!  John (super friendly and knowledgeable, by the way...) came out and took care of the issue and even removed some old birds nests that were in the same area as the wasps for us.  He also used his "dust" to prevent honeybees coming back from where I showed him we had a huge honeycomb about a year ago in a separate part of our roof.  $75 total.  Took less than 30 min.

Always a winner!!  The bowls, tacos, burritos and quesadillas are always delicious and the service is always fast, even with a line out the door.  LOVE this place.

Uber is uber-cool!  Never had a bad experience yet.  They're fast, friendly and you can track where they are in picking you up on their cool app.  And if you want a bit more room when traveling with friends, simply select the SUV option.  They also have promo codes they will send out occasionally for discounts.  We used one last night for $10 off of our $18 fare.  Awesome!!  I also learned that not only do you get to rate the driver after each trip, the driver also rates the rider(s).  Apparently I'm a 5 out of 5 stars (of course I am!).  But if you treat the driver like crap or end up leaving a mess in the car, the driver can rate you low and Uber drivers can see your ratings and pass on picking you up.  So be kind and keep that in mind!  Used to always use discount cab, but I've made the switch to Uber after the great experience with them (and after way too many stinky, gross cabs/drivers)!

You can't beat Harkins!  The $1 refillable cup and the tshirt for popcorn save us 100s of dollars each year, or so I believe!  The parking at the Chandler mall is somewhat of a hassle, but the theater itself is clean, chairs are comfy and the popcorn and sodas are always great.
