This place is great, we recently moved to the area and wanted to try some local eateries. My wife myself and 3 of my younger kids went there for happy hour...2-6 Monday through Friday.  They had half off appetizers and .45 wings everything we got was excellent, with the bonus of local bar people watching! We even went back the next morning for breakfat, again cheap and excellent.  We will definitely make this one of our new spots to hang. Also Monday through Thursday they have 1 dollar drafts and bottles. ..yes 1 dollar. Can't wait to go back without the kids, it looked like they also had a good karaoke and dance floor set up.

Just ordered a large order 9 sandwiches online and when the guy came to the door with only 2 bags I said wow you actually got 67$ worth of sandwiches in 2 bags? He bragged about how hard it was and of course it was missing a sandwhich. When I called all I got was. I can take it off your order or refund you. Or make it and deliver it to you. Nothing for the inconvenience I ask..nope. wow. Spend 80$ on fast food and get inconvenienced. Such poor customer service. I usually don't type these so long but,I thought I may as well since I'm just sitting here waiting for the sandwich that should have been delivered the first time. What else should I be doing...that's right I should be enjoying the party that we are having while we all wait for the sandwich that should have already been delivered. Thanks for nothing Jimmy Johns! Not that you care because you are too hipster cool for that. But that was the last time I or anyone at my party will be partaking in your fine establishment.

Just happened to notice this place driving down Bell a couple times.  It is nestled between a car wash and a thrift store. Once I walked inside I was overcome, in a good way by the smoky smell of the wood they use to smoke their meats. We got seated right away, and noticed that the music they were playing was really good. Then my wife looked up and saw a live musician perched on an upstairs stage. Would have never guessed it, throughout our meal we were loving every minute of that. The food was excellent, but the best dish was the beef fajitas my wife ordered.  I am telling you right now, they are the best anywhere in town. I guarantee you that. Love this place and will definitely be returning.

Ate there and the food was good. However, 3 days after I went there I noticed 2 charges on my debit from them instead of 2. They deny that there was an error made on their side and refused to return the money they stole from me. I spent 4 hours trying to file a dispute with my bank and am still waiting on a resolution. BEWARE IF YOU GO THEY MAY STEAL MONEY FROM YOU

We recently celebrated my Dad's 75th birthday at Lenero and we had the best experience ever. The staff went out of their way to make sure that we were taken care of (thank you Stacie) But the food made the night, every bite of everything we ordered (Lamb, Lentils, Kale salad, fajitas) was exceptional. This will for sure be a restaurant that we will go to very frequent.

Great happy hour 3 to 6 pm. The presentation of all the food was nice. Made it feel really expensive when it wasn't.  They had a kids menu as well, which is rare at a sushi place. Would definitely come back again, especially for the 3 dollar Blue Moons.

Second time at this location and can't wait for my next visit. They not only have great food but also a great happy hour. Every day of the week 3-7p half off appetizer and several sushi items.

Hek yeah this place is 1 minute from my house. I just ate there and have to say the best pulled pork I've ever had. I ordered online and did take out. While I was there they had me try their Ghost Pepper sauce, fantastic. I also had the fries which were also very good. We definitely be returning and telling all my friends about it.

New employees not making a simple sandwich correctly..and poor management or a situation,if you can call it managemet,he even hung up on me when I called him out on using new employees as an excuse. Way too overpriced for the horrible service you get from here,I wander if their corporate office realizes how watered down their appeal is getting.
