I would give this ten star if there were more stars! The best most fabulous pedi and mani ever! Don't go anywhere else!

Pedi was very rushed! Mani was awesome ... They did a great job .. Just won't have the army military guy do it...

If you can help it.. don't order from this one.. Ordered wings this last order.. wrong flavor, cold and soggy.  My last order was pizza, and hardly any toppings or cheese.. also cold.. I am across the street!

Will never go back. Food was not very good. They didn't get my order correct either. The shrimp wontons were so bad they were just thrown away. The beef.. Greasy and tasted disgusting. Gave it a two star cuz I had the tai seafood soup .. Was great .. But mostly broth. We will not be coming back

Sushi amazing! Went for lunch... The two waitresses were immature and no personality .. Yes.. The looked nice... But both had attitude!  Will go back for the sushi for sure! Just hope next tine I get better service. I'm sure if I was a hot man... They would hv been a lot nicer ... Sad

Sushi was not that great . Got two specialty rolls .. Waitress was very good until Her' end .. We just started eating .. Probably going to order more.. And she gave us the check cuz she was going on break .. Very unprofessional and rude. Will not be going back ..the people giving this place good reviews do not know good sushi !

Love this trail... Many options to veer off to different ones during hike. It's fairly flat and easy. Saw a lot of seniors , but also many not so senior as well . A beautiful hike, will be a regular as it's near my house!

Great trail.. Bring plenty of water .. Gets tough near the top .. But hang in.. It's pretty much a cool down the entire way down .

Burgers look good ... Was not hot.. Ordered it med. well.. It was very pink .. Salad was great ... Service very very slow..... Drinks very iffy... Would not recommend ... Beer is great ... But I'm not a beer drinker ... They ran of a liquor ... And they add 18 percent gratuity to bill ! I tip according to service .. Got another drink after my group left... And they charged another 18 percent on a group of seven! Bs

Had to give it one star to write ..would rather sleep in a tent.. Horribly smelly musty smoky rooms . Light bulbs out .. Lamps not working . Loud traffic.. No covers .. What!? No covers!?!?!?! Run the other way!

Always loved this place... But had a Mediterranean gyro .. Was really bad. Soggy .. Lettuce bad and lots of oil ! The salad was not good either.. Was like it was sitting out for awhile. Not fresh. Bummer !

Love to give this more stars.. The cod app was amazing .. But very very small.. Sushi was not very good. The hostess was nice.. But looked like she should be at a strip club the way she was dressed! Waitress was great! Hunter!
