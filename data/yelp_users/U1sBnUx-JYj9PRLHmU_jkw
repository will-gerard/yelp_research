Old airport and really confusing to get around in it or around it. There are 4 terminals - and they are all in need of a renovation. Eateries are OK - pretty standard fare. Lack of charging stations is a definite bummer. It's just an old dingy, sticky airport. It just needs some TLC to bring it back.

Yeah. It's a solid asteroid of a star. Would give a half star - but Yelp sezs I have to leave a review.  They look like they are trying to revamp the airport--for over a year -- but nothing has changed since the last time I was here. Heck of a contractor - like to see how they pulled the contract over Skyharbor's already blind eyes. Just milking these guys.  Big low score for TSA. Lines like Newark. The best part: they have TSA precheck - in fact, you can sign up for this premium service at the airport. They will take you information, your money ..... O yeah, just informed by the TSA agents that there is no such thing as TSA precheck in Phoenix.  Yup. They got the signs, they got the guy just took your money - but there is no precheck line. As a result - the lines just build and build. Returning a rental car is the worst. The rental agency is located far off the airport campus - I think it is near an oasis of some sort. But no matter, it will take you an extremely long time to return the car due to poor signage (especially if traveling from Tuscon), then you have to wait for the bus, then get the grand surprise of waiting in line for TSA....followed by the sight of non-existent construction. I think Phoenix never rose from the ashes - instead their airport never got out of the mud of this pigsty. This place reminds me of Detroit's old airport or Philly - everything is old, dank, and sticky.

Wow. Got a very professional greeting by the hostess, Michelle. My first time at the MGM Signature and she upgraded me to the suite. Highly recommend getting one of these rooms, fridge, stove, huge TV, jacuzzi tub, private bathroom - a very nice hotel experience!! Didn't have the opportunity to try out their other facilities - but I would make this my hotel of choice. My only complaint was the processing time. More of a management error - they need at least three people working the desk or a concierge. Some people are trying to check in while others are asking details about the area. Gotta give Michelle credit - she was very polite and professional to the intellectually inept visiting the front desk...,

The hostess was a bit off, but my waitress was excellent. A really unique interior - the latticework walls are beautiful as well as the 'not for human consumption' Goldfish tanks.   The dancing Boy-band videos are a wee much when munching away. I came here in the afternoon when the traffic was pretty light.  The noodles are definitely fresh - I don't know who makes 'em, but dang tasty!!! Ordered their Beijing 9 Won Ton and I liked it - authentic and flavorful. In fact, quite s few people around me ordered the same thing. The Soup Master is awesome here! I think it's like most restaurants in Vegas - if it's crowded-best bet is to move on. But if the foot traffic is light - definitely worth the stop.
