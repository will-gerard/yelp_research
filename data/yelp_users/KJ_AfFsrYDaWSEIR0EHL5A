If you are getting a basic car wash, you'll be happy. If you for anything extra, be prepared for disappointment because it won't get done or will be done poorly.   Also, extra pushy windshield guy, so be prepared for that.   Finally, don't be in a rush. This is possibly the slowest car wash I have ever been to.

Overall I had a great experience.  The doctor was patient with me and really went out of his way to make sure that my vision was as good as it could be.  After an exaustive exam, I ended up with 2 perscriptions; 1 for distance, 1 for close up.  I work on a computer all day (and most nights), so the doctor thought a bifocal solution was not the best for me at this time.  Out front, the optician up front was very nice and extremely knowledgeable, making sure that I got the best lenses for the purpose they would be used for.  Unfortuneately, the lenses order where the wrong prescription (I wanted to get my 'indoor' perscription filled first) and I hope to get it corrected soon.

Tired of paying dealer service prices for possibly shabby service?  Then it's time to call EuroTechs.  Specializing in MINI Cooper and Jaguar repairs, I had my MINI in for an alternator replacement.  Not only was the repair finished quickly, it was also cheaper than the dealer charged for the same service!  Not only did my repair get taken care of, Jerry also gave me a list of items that should be repaired fairly soon.  His list made sense, included the installation price and was reasonably priced.    Helpful, clean and affordable.  If you own a MINI in or around Phoenix, EuroTechs should be your shop of choice!

If you are looking for great food and amazing craft beer list, this is the place. Amazing service to boot. Don't be afraid to ask questions either. They will take care of you!   Be sure to try the Spain Pizza or any of the specials. If you aren't sure about the beer, they are some of the most knowledgeable in all of the valley.
