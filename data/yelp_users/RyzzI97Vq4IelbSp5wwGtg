I have been a long-time customer of this particular car wash but am likely going to look elsewhere.   The wait time is significant; prepare for 45-90 minutes wait time. Yes, seriously - 90 minutes!  I have brought a laptop in the past and was able to pick up wi fi.   Service: The folks at the front are always friendly and chatty. The individuals who wash the cars and detail are always hard working.  That said, I once specifically mentioned NO air freshener and was nauseated after a strong smelling disgusting smell was sprayed all over my fairly - brand-new car!    This did only happen once, but it took over a month to rid my car of the smell.   The car wash itself is ok. It seemed to be better in the past. There are often streaks on my windows or dusties here and there from the cloth wipes they use.    Since the wait time is significant, I wish there were better seating options. Instead, there are maybe 6-7 seats indoors.  Outside, there are some benches and tables along with a few chairs in the shade.   They do not allow people to leave the car and walk somewhere for the time being; one must stay with the car the entire time.

It's Sonic - so you get what is expected here!   I love the lemon berry slushes, and sometimes I get cherry limeades.   This location is on a super busy area, but the service is fast.

Interesting events and friendly employees.   Parking: Super easy and plentiful.  We went during a lights event, and they had plenty of parking.   Events: I went here for the Dale Chihuly glass exhibit in the spring of 2014. I have been familiar with his work since the 90s due to my art teacher.   It was interesting and lovely, but I should have gone after sunset. I walked around the gardens to see what it was like.    The DBG  Las Noches de las Luminarias event was $30 per ticket.  I purchased in advance, since my friend said that they often sell out. I'm glad I did. When we got there, people were trying to purchase tix and could not get any!  The event was lovely and not too crowded but plenty of people.  We went around 6:30p and stayed for over two hours.  The employees also had some telescopes out and we could view the stars.  The light exhibits were pretty and easy to tour.

What a fun and helpful experience!  I went to Runner's Den to get some new shoes for my recent running hobby. The staff members immediately greeted us.  The man who helped us was super friendly, funny and knowledgeable!  It was fun to chat with him about his marathon experiences.   I knew the type of show I wanted, but he was able to help me differentiate between the various types and discussed support as well.   The guy I was with was considering shoes, and the employee was helping him consider some of the options based on what he mentioned due to his injury.   The store has a variety of shoes, running apparel, laces, accessories and more. They also have some sports nutrition products too.   I will return!

I have eaten some of the food in the grocery area, including the summer salad rolls, cupcakes, and one of the famous English Muffins.  My friend ordered a sandwich which appeared huge (probably for two meals!)  I should have ordered the sandwich; the summer salad rolls had some sort of mayo in them (I didn't realize this), and I hate mayo.  Besides that, I enjoyed my fat English muffin with delicious grape jelly. I took home a red velvet cupcake to last me a few days, and it was wonderfully moist with cream cheese icing.    The atmosphere seemed to be a fun chill vibe with somewhat friendly employees. Some were friendly, others seemed to have a bit of an attitude or just a bit aloof/rude.  While we were there, I heard about four The Decemberists songs, and that is always a plus for me!   The only problem I had was finding parking. I did not realize valet is complimentary (well free + tip).  I drove around forever, and it was crazy with cars everywhere. The residential areas within a 1-mile radius require a residential permit, or the car gets towed. So, beware of this prior to going!   Also, the prices are a bit more than I thought, but then again, it seems to be a typical trendy funky place near more pricey restaurants, so I should have known.

The reviews are correct; this is the best Chinese food in the valley!   I was pleasantly surprised, as I haven't had good Chinese food in Phoenix yet, and I've lived here for over seven years.   The service was excellent and efficient. The tables and restaurant were all very clean.   The curry vegetables were deliciously lightly flavored but not too heavy in curry - more like a sneaky spice. The egg rolls were like typical egg rolls, but nice and fresh.

A nice little restaurant in Glendale!  Parking: Super easy and plentiful. This is in a strip mall area, near Jus' Country and a barber shop.    Atmosphere: very quiet, though we went once during Christmas season, and cheesy Christmas songs were playing the whole time.     Service: Pretty decent and friendly. The wait staff are attentive.   Food:  I have had the vegetable curry several times. It is delicious and creamy with a sneaky spice.  Also, I can specify which vegetables to *not* include in the curry, and they make everything tasty and fresh.  My friends who eat meat have enjoyed the chicken and beef dishes that they have ordered.   Drinks: I have only had water and green tea.

I like it!   The Downtown Y does double duty. One can exercise in the older Y section or head on over to the Sun Devil Fitness Center. The Sun Devil side has cardio machines with one's own personal TV!  The weight room is much better on the older Y side.    Price:  Very decent. I do get a discount with my work.    Hours: Excellent, 5 am open time on weekdays, on weekends 7 am Sat and 9 am Sunday.    Parking: Free with sticker.    Location:  Less than a mile from where I live. I save so much gas from not having to drive to a gym now!  Group exercise classes:  In the older part of the Y, these can be confusing to find. The cycle room is on the third floor, as you maze your way up the stairs passed other areas of the gym that often seem deserted.     Cycle is a lot of fun. I think instructors should introduce themselves to new people, though.   Facility: there are plenty of cardio machines. I like that there are four rowing machines and a variety of others.   The weight room in the older part of the Y is huge and has excellent equipment.  Watch out for posers down here, ha!   There are lockers, showers, bathroom, and an indoor pool.    Staff: Most staff are friendly.

What a beauty!  This ornate lovely theater is as good as it gets!   The parking may be costly, but it is downtown Phoenix! There were lots for $10 near, or one can choose to park at meters (free from 10 pm to 8 am).    The inside is just lovely. The ornate decor and carvings are interesting to view.   Service with a smile: The employees were all friendly and smiling and helpful!    The seats were comfortable but no spot for a drink. The guy in front of me was very tall with a man bun so a bit difficult to see Sufjan Stevens, but still, a lovely venue.

Great service, friendly people, call backs as promised.  I had an unfortunate car wreck, but the main concern was getting a driver's side mirror.  My insurance only pays after a certain amount, and the damages were minor enough where I would be paying 100% for everything.   There are paint scrapes as well, but for safety, I mainly just wanted to get my mirror.  I thought it was nice that they provided two estimates for me - one for just the mirror and one with the mirror and paint job.  He suggested just getting a mirror for safety and said the paint scrapes could wait till later, as they didn't affect my driving.  I called to secure the mirror on a late Monday afternoon, and by Tuesday afternoon, the mirror was in.  My car was fixed within 90 minutes or so.  The office there has WiFi, in case you don't have a person to come pick you up and are stuck there for a while.    Also when I was looking at the choices of body shops for my wreck, the location here is nice.  At 7th Ave and Highland, if a person does not have a person to pick him/her up, the light rail stop is close at Central and Camelback, maybe a 5-minute walk.  This location is maybe 5 minutes from my house as well.  The office staff are all very friendly and the service is honest and reliable. Great job Select Auto Body!

This place is fantastic! My friend Julie recommended them, since she has 2 cats and had really good experiences with her cat's surgery. One thing I love is that it's a cat only clinic. There are no annoying dogs barking at my cat or scaring my cat. The staff are super friendly and know a lot about cats, obviously. The vet, Dr. Justin Smith, explains everything with great detail and doesn't act as though in a hurry. He remembers things about me and the cats from previous conversations. I had my new kitty neutered there, and my older cat has gone for a variety of reasons. The clinic also has options for boarding in case you have to leave town and want your cats to stay there.  I was very impressed after one visit. I had spoken to Dr. Smith regarding an issue at 10 am on a Friday morning.  The clinic closes at 12p on Fridays. However, at 7 pm that same evening, I received an email about the issue we had discussed.

This PetSmart... I only go since it is on the way home from work.   The PetSmart is by a now defunct Bed, Bath and Beyond.   The selection is just so-so.    When one is ready to leave and check out, there are never adequate cashiers.  I was there yesterday, and the line was nine customers deep. Not one employee came to help the poor chap!  Not only that, then the one cashier was in a rather pissy mood.  I requested a price check on something that was for sure on clearance, and he argued with me and was rude about it. He was rather snappy - well the register says it's $1.47!!  He did not even bother requesting a price check.  Any other store, one could request a price check.    The parking lot does have a cart corral, which some PetSmarts do not have.  This is fairly new, as about two years ago, this location did not have this.

Fun, chill atmosphere with decent food and a variety of beer!   I had driven by this brewery so many times on the way to Sky Song but did not realize it was here. It's in the middle of an odd shopping strip. However, enter the building, and it's like I was transported to a ski town in New Mexico.  To me, it reminded me of a chill / laid back bar in a ski town!   Parking: Super easy and plentiful.    Atmosphere: Very chill.  Some people arrived with gym gear on, and others were dressed up for some sort of party.   I wear jeans everywhere, and the guy I was with also had jeans.  No one cares.  It was casual!   It's a bit loud but a fun bar.   Service: Pretty decent though just semi-friendly.  We did have a server come by every few minutes, though, and our waters were refilled.   Food:  I had the caprese salad and the soft pretzel with mustard and cheese. The caprese salad was good, and the tomatoes seemed quite fresh and flavorful.   The pretzel had cheese dip that I enjoyed; I dislike mustard so did not try it.   The guy had something, and I don't even recall - some kind of sandwich or wrap.   Drinks: I had the cider on tap; it was a quality cider.   We also ordered some type of beer, and it was rather strong.  They have a ton of options.  My friend recommended the Orange Blossom.

I've always had fun at Rula Bula. Summer nights can get super packed, but that is typical of a Mill Ave bar. In the winter, they have heating lamps in the back, and it's warm and cozy out there. They have cider, which is sometimes hard to find.   In the summer, there was live music. My friend and I had some fun when they were playing Irish music one night.

Oh wow, love this place!  I have attended their ThanksLiving event for the last two years and have a great time enjoying delicious fake turkey (made from seiten and breaded), side dishes, and yummy desserts. Plus, the proceeds go to the Humane Society.    Besides ThanksLiving, this place has faux meat down! Many of my meat-eating friends say that the fake meat is just as delicious with a very similar mouthfeel as the meat they're imitating.  I have ordered salads, stir-fries, and the desserts here and have loved everything.  The stir fry vegetables are cooked to perfection - not too overcooked and crispy but not too raw still. The place can get packed on weekends and evenings, though, so sometimes finding a table can be a problem.  If one chooses an off time, it's usually no problem.   Besides the slowish service, I haven't been superimpressed with the cashiers.

Amazing little pizza joint in downtown Phoenix.   I cannot believe I just found this place, though I've lived up the street for over five years.   Location: 5th Ave, downtown Phoenix.  There's street parking here and there, but I can walk!  Food:  Pizza, salads, sandwiches, bread, Nutella-based desserts, wine.  We ordered a pear salad that was tasty; it included arugula, pear, and cheese. The bread delivered with the salad was a white chewy bread.  My friend wanted meat on his pizza, and I didn't. They allowed us to get half and half; I got my veggie pizza on one side, and his sausage was on the other. Perfect!   The dessert we ordered was kind of like a delicious deconstructed funnel cake with Nutella for dipping sauce - delicious!    Service: The servers were efficient and brought us water throughout and were helpful and quick.  I wouldn't say the employees were overly friendly, though. While walking in, a female employee opened the door but just kind of stood there, not saying anything. No, "welcome" or "hello" - nothing.  Strange to me, but that's my Texan roots craving some more friendliness!   For reservations, one must have a group of six or more to make reservations.  We just had two but easily found a table on a Saturday evening at 5:30pm.

For a variety of food and drink, Carly's Bistro really has some great choices, and the location is perfect for me, since I live less than 10 minutes away.  We ordered the antipasto appetizer that had fresh mozzerella, olives, pesto, and delicious crusty bread.  I ordered the spinach salad with walnuts, dried cranberries, and gorgonzola cheese. The salad was surprisingly huge compared to other places that serve this kind of thing. My friend ordered a cheese sandwich and loved it. The service is OK and it was pretty busy, so I guess we expected better. But overall, great place for lunch or dinner!

Excellent service, delicious food, intimate setting.    I had gift cards from the Play2Stay deal with Hotel Valley Ho.  The $30 towards food and drink went a long way! The menu includes appetizers, main dishes, and desserts.  The apps range from $6-12 or so, the main courses are up to $25 or so, and desserts were around $6-12.   Everything we ordered was super tasty!    Location: Inside Hotel Valley Ho. There's self-parking and valet.  The restaurant is in the tower, under the fitness center.   Food:  The meal we ordered included grilled asparagus, a spaghetti squash dish, drinks and dessert.  The grilled asparagus with parm cheese was made just right with a bit of cheese and salt.   The spaghetti squash dish had cheese, tomatoes, and other vegetables and was made quite well.   For dessert, I tasted a strawberry shake which was delicious and fresh.  I ordered a dessert wine that was sweet and smooth. Other options included pies, other flavors of shakes, etc.   We ordered a margarita and a martini. The martini was some sort of strawberry with  a hint of jalapeno. It sounds odd but was a nice mix.   Service: The restaurant was not really happening on a Sunday night at 7:30 PM, but the server was super attentive, friendly and helpful.    Ambiance:  Retro decor with little booths and tables. The cafe includes outdoor seating.

This place is great!  No one greeted me when I arrived...I looked around for a few minutes and then a hostess showed me where the rest of my group was sitting.    The group I was with ordered four appetizers for us to share.    We had some guacamole, quesadillas, nachos, and some lettuce wraps.  I had the first two things listed, as the other two contain meat.  Everything was delicious and spicy.  The guac had a delicious peppery flavor and was served with chips and pita.   The menu has a variety of interesting options, and the prices are very reasonable.  The service was wonderful.  Our waiter came by numerous times to check on drink refills and was friendly as well.    There's a private room which one can reserve that fits maybe 15-20 people. It seems like a nice option for a birthday party or event, such as the one we had.    I ate here on a Monday night, so parking was easy. However, I suspect on weekends, the lot is packed.

This is the place to be apparently!  Excellent service, good food, and heaters on the patio!   My experience with the restaurant is from hosting a happy hour for an organization in which I am involved.   Parking: easy - it's in this shopping center with all these other stores, similar to one of the other billions of outdoor strip mall type things in the valley.   Service: amaze! We had a very handsome guy and lady help us out for the happy hour event. They were attentive, nice, and provided suggestions. This was a happy hour for individuals in the health field, and they provided ideas for veg-based foods.  The waters were refilled every few minutes, and the food came out super quickly and was good.   Food:   One can order happy hour foods only at the bar, so we did not.  We ordered: Chips and guac, ahi tuna, chips and artichoke dip, Brusells sprouts, caprese salad, roasted carrots, and a few other items for folks to share.  The grilled artichokes/dip were delicious! This was a unique dish. The caprese salad and roasted carrots were also tasty. The artichoke dip was mostly cheese and very little artichoke or spinach.  The roasted carrots were warm and slightly sweet -soft but not mushy.   Ambiance: Chill, seemingly like any other trendy chain place.   This place was *packed* on a Tuesday night at 6-6:30pm. I did not realize it was such a happenin' place, but with the service and good food, I can see why!

Delicious and unique flavors!   After some Mexican food, my friend and I decided to cool down at Gelato Spot.  The staff members are friendly, and you can get samples of any of the gelato.  The scoops are rather large! The single scoop was enough!   The parking could be an issue, as it's in a popular area of Scottsdale.   The prices are a bit steep, but the gelato is high quality.    The seating areas include a roomy area with large windows overlooking Scottsdale Rd.

Fun trendy hotel near Old Town Scottsdale!   I purchased the Stay2Play package for the summer.  This included a $30 voucher for anything at the hotel, two free drinks, a free dessert, an amenity (they brought some fruit, espresso beans and pecans).  The package was just $139.  There were also discounts on the spa, but I didn't use this.   The parking is free in a lot, or valet.   The location is right near Old Town Scottsdale. You could walk to numerous places in Scottsdale or drive for a couple minutes.    The room itself was trendy, clean and modern/retro.  The major complaint I have is that the A/C never cooled down. I woke up numerous times very sweaty and uncomfortable. I didn't feel like calling for service at 1:30 AM though.  The room included a stand up shower and a nice, deep tub.  Robe and smell-good toiletries included.    The pool is like a big party pool with couples, bros, and ladies' nights all over. The servers at the pool are attentive and bring people ice water. One can order food and drinks at the pool. The music on Sunday afternoon was a fun mix of modern alternative and rap.  The next morning (Monday) was more like crappy top 40.    The fitness center was one of the better hotel fitness rooms I've seen! This included two step mills, a spin class grade bike, several recumbent bikes, treadmills, plenty of weights, a Pilates reformer, and more!  Ice water, towels, and apples were included in the fitness center.  Headphones were also provided if you forget yours.    The restaurant - Zuzu - is super tasty. I loved the meal there (that is a separate review).

I have been here a few times, since I live in the apartments within a block's walking distance.  The food and beverages offered are some great choices, including delicious vegan brownies and a tasty veggie sandwich.  The tea was good as well. I have not tried the coffee.  The prices were about average for a place such as this.   The free Wi Fi is nice, and I love how close it is to where I live. Supposedly there are small discounts if you live at the Roosevelt Square Apartments and/or ASU student, but I've mentioned that each time and have not received discounts.   The seating can be variable, depending on the day/time that you go. I have found seating sometimes, but other times was at a wobbly table and ended up leaving (it was the only one available).  In the later afternoon/evenings, it can get a bit more crowded and harder to find seats.

I like this specific location for several reasons:  1)  Easy accessible parking. This Starbucks shares its location with other grocery stores. There's plenty of spots.   2)  Lots of space to sit and/or study.  I have been here on multiple Saturdays/Sundays and have been able to find a little table and /or seat for myself.  Free wifi.    3)  Friendly fast service in my experience.   The negatives: 1) The music is way too loud. I know it's supposed to be fun to have the loud music, but whoa, a bit much!   2)  One restroom, but that's typical.

I drove by this place after work in Chandler numerous times and finally decided to give it a try.   I love Thai food but am particular about the Tom Yum soup.  This Thai Rama location makes the best Tom Yum soup, and I have asked for specific veggies, and they listen and make it the way I like.  I have ordered a side of veg and rice as well, and it's always fresh and delicious.   I get take out, since I'm often on my way home from work.  I go in around 4p, so it's an odd hour for dinner, so it's not crowded then.  The service is friendly, but I haven't dine in so haven't had that experience yet.   The only complaint I have is that sometimes on weekends, I call and call and call, and I never get an answer, so I make the trek up to the Thai Rama Tempe, which is similar but not quite as good.

Slow service, long lines.   This location always has a long line.  I wish the location would hire more employees.  I do like the UPS store for its simplicity in terms of being able to ship either using UPS or USPS.  However, if you choose USPS through the UPS store, it is super pricey.   This particular location often has a scratchy-not-all-the-way-in-range radio station playing fairly loudly, and there is usually just one person working.  I usually wait in line for 5 to 15 minutes.  Sigh!  The location also offers cards, stamps, shipping materials, and more.  It is near a nails place.

I went here back when I still ate meat. The chicken was delicious and cooked just right. The salad was fresh and interesting. I consider myself a very picky eater, and everything was just right here. The french fries were delicious and crisp.  The prices were good for this type of place.  My friend ordered a burger and fries and also enjoyed her meal.   I love the atmosphere here. It feels like we're not in Arizona, and that is always a nice thing.  I like how it's counter service, so no waiter is trying to rush us out of there.   I would go here more often except that I live in Phoenix now.

Excellent service, fun Team Trivia nights, a happening sports bar.   Location: Off 36th St and Indian school. Parking is OK but sometimes when crowded, like on a Friday night, it's impossible to find a spot near the bar.    Food: The bar serves kind of typical bar food, like nachos, hot dogs, big pretzels, and sandwiches. There are other options as well. The pretzel is tasty, but I haven't tried much else. There are other fried apps as well.    Drinks: I order the cider, and you can order pitchers of cider too.  There are beers and cocktails as well.   Service:  A+  The servers here are friendly, timely and helpful. I have been going to Team Trivia here for over six years, and some of the same servers are still here. They will do separate bills, come check up on our table multiple times, and refill drinks constantly.    Ambiance: This is a typical sports bar and they host Team Trivia Weds, Thurs and Fri nights. It's free, and your team can win gift cards to use for food/drinks!  Get there early, or your team may not get a table.

This location is a true 24 hour fitness, which is nice. But it is a long drive from my downtown Phoenix home. I choose this one over the Camelback one sometimes, if I have to be up NW.   The gym seems fairly new, and it is rarely crowded. They are just one story, which I prefer. The classes are mostly pretty good. I have gone to the morning and weekend classes, and most of the time the instructors do a great job, except for the yoga classes. I prefer yoga classes with a true yogi.  The shower area is a bit larger than other 24 Hours I've been to, and the locker room is a lot nicer than most.   The instructors are semi-friendly (not that much though), and depending on the front desk staff...they are sometimes indifferent and sometimes mildly friendly. The manager is definitely not too excited to be working there.   I have a membership since I had purchased a 3-year deal in Texas, so I got a great membership deal back then.

No longer a Chandler resident, but a fun brewery!   Parking: There is street parking here and there, and there is also a lot in front of the brewery. It can get packed!    Atmosphere:   Super casual. It is loud in here with lots of TVs and sports.    Service:   The wait staff are always around and very friendly. However, we kept getting asked if we ordered this or that, and it was never our order!   Food:  I have had the pretzels, various meals, and the brownie dessert. I love pretzels, but they have to be excellent. These are certainly excellent!  The dessert was rich, chocolate-y and peanut-y, so yum!   Drinks: Various beers, cocktails, ciders, and more. I had the cider on tap. Crisp, cool and a decent price.

A fun place that has Colombian and Brazilian music every other week, and according to my friends from South America, it is hard to find!   The wine/food are somewhat similar to Postino, but this place had a more fun atmosphere, maybe due to the live music. The live music does require a cover charge ($5), but that's typical of most places.    We did go in the middle of the summer, and that probably wasn't the best idea. It was extremely hot, so they had the misters on. Yet, the misters were so heavy-flow, we were actually soaked with water.  I can't wait to return in the lovely fall/winter months.

I already want to go back! The menu had so many tasty options. I love Indian food, and I realize this is Americanized Indian food, but it was rather delicious.  The menu offers gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan options.   I ordered the Chef's Special to try the four sauces with rice, naan, and the two ingredients in which one can choose.  The tikka masala sauce was definitely the best, but the others had great flavors too.  I got the vegan chicken and mixed vegetables. It was so delicious, and I am already trying to think of when I can return.   The service was OK. It took a while when we were done, and they weren't that busy. However, it's not a big deal.

Everything I have ordered here or tasted from a friend's entry has been delicious.   I love Indian food anyway with its "sneaky spice" and delicious warm flavors.   The naan here is delicious, and one order could feed four to five people.   I have ordered the Dal Makhani, Punjabi Chole, Dil Bahar Korma, and Sialkoti Rajmeh, and all of these had delicious flavors and spice.  You can determine the level of spice, like most Indian restaurants.   The entries come with white or brown rice.   The only complaint I have is that it can take a while even after seated.  Both times I have gone for dine-in, it was fairly crowded, but it was at least 20 minutes before someone even came by to ask for our orders.  However, due to the extensive menu, this wasn't a problem, since there are many delicious items in which to choose, we needed that time!  Water refills are constant and the food comes out quite quick after ordered.   I'm also excited to know they are open till 10pm.

I started up at Urban Yoga in mid-July and took advantage of the 2 weeks for $25 for the new students.  After that, one can receive a small discount on a 6 or 12-month package, so I purchased a six month package.   I live in downtown Phoenix and did my research. This was the cheapest and closest yoga studio which has numerous classes throughout the day to fit a lot of different schedules.  The weekend schedules are kind of lacking though.   I have enjoyed the classes I have attended. I prefer all-level flow, urban flow, slow flow, and some of the workshops. Zen yoga is not my thing, but the instructors who teach it do a great job.  Most of the instructors introduce themselves and attempt to learn everyone's names, but not all.  Most everyone is rather friendly and helps you with poses in a nice way.  This is one major difference between fitness center yoga and studio yoga - they truly help you get the poses correct.  Most instructors have great music that isn't too loud but just right for the course. However, there are a few instructors that either have the music way too loud or don't speak loud enough, so I cannot hear what they're saying. I know a friend of mine who goes here too said the same thing, so it isn't just my hearing.   I really enjoy almost every class I have attended.  The studio itself is clean and nice with decent-priced clothing and accessories and yoga mats.  The large room in front is nice, though they often open the doors even in hot weather. I currently have about six mosquito bites from a variety of classes I have attended in the last four days.   The studio does not offer hot yoga or any other types of classes. This wasn't a problem for me, since hot yoga would be too hot for me, and they keep the main yoga room around 80-85 (from when I've peeked at the thermostat), which is plenty warm for me.   The parking is great - free parking in the Lexington One garage right next to the studio or free street marking at meters after 5pm or weekends/holidays.  I was initially worried about how many spots would be open, but I always find a spot.    The workshops I have attended have been good so far. I went to a workshop where we focused on back bends and techniques in which to improve and a fall-themed workshop. What I really enjoy about this studio is each instructor brings his/her unique qualities to each class taught.  None of them are the same. Some have music, some don't.  Even with the same instructors, I never have the same exact class.   Also, there is filtered water available if one brings a water bottle to fill.  There is a charge for towels, so bring a towel if you expect to sweat (I often do!)    The studio also has massages available, starting at $50 per hour, I think. One of the massage therapists comes into some of the classes and helps adjust and provide some mini-massages.    There are two foundations classes per week. I had been to yoga for many years, but these are still helpful for review.

UPDATE: I have been coming here pretty regularly since 2012 now.  Wow, this place is by far my favorite!    Parking: The garage is still available, though one has to get a token post  yoga to get out of the garage, kinda a pain, but it's covered parking in Phoenix!   Classe: I shopped around prior to joining and continuing to attend. The times of classes are excellent. That said, I wish there were more Tuesday 6pm options.  The options for Tues/Thurs at 6pm don't work for me.    Instructors:  Having taught group exercise for years and years, I notice things.  This place has incredibly caring, qualified, and helpful instructors. Most classes, the instructor walks around and introduces him or herself.  Not all, but most.  They also help you adjust the poses and answer questions.  I have been able to experience almost every instructor's class and appreciate the unique differences each person brings.   That said, one instructor did push me beyond what was comfortable and was kind of rude about it - not a fan so I just do not attend those classes again.   My favorite instructors include Emily, Tara, Chelsea, Mollie, Nancy, and Jenn.  But, I will attend other classes and will go when there are subs too.     Workshops: Back when I had the 6 month membership, they used to allow this membership to get to attend workshops for free. So, I was the one yogi among all yoga teacher trainees.  That's OK - I went to some great workshops!  I have paid for a couple others and enjoyed the content.   Cost:  Again, I shopped around, and this studio provides high quality yoga classes for a great price.  There are always specials, and that's usually when I purchase my memberships.   Ambiance:  This place is super friendly - not snobby at all.   The management/front desk employees have always been nice.

I am sure this place has potential, but my one experience made the employees seem apathetic and uncaring.   Location: Near the Whole Foods in north Scottsdale. The woman in front of us in line was sporting all Louis Vuitton and heavy duty makeup. It's the place to be.   Selection: Tons and tons of running shoes. There were treadmills where staff members could assess one's running gait and determine the best shoe.     Service:  Lame.  There were at least five employees. One employee helped this woman and her child with a return for over 20 minutes. I had about four things to purchase.   The store lost about $50 worth of sales, due to the amount of time they took with this stupid return.  Numerous other employees could have come to help me make my purchase.   I don't know that I would return here. The experience with this one time made me think that they are not interested in helping customers.

Thanks for helping me organize, Container Store!   I could spend hours - AND - a lot of money here.  It's a good thing it's a 20 minute drive for me, though I know there will be a new CS on 20th St/Camelback very soon!  Location: Near some car dealerships and a Whole Foods in Scottsdale.  Great location. I can get some organizational gear, then go get lunch at WF.  Perfect combination.   Parking: Plenty of parking in the lot.    Store:  This store has it all.  I have purchased organizational gear to organize my kitchen, bath, and my desk / work space.  You can enroll in their Pop Perks and receive 15% off coupons for items.    The kitchen section includes multiple items that can be used to organize silver ware, under sink messes, and flour/sugar/etc., plus tons of lunch box containers to help you store your lunch.    The store also has sales from time to time.  The employees are friendly and helpful.   The only downfall - I am sure one could find cheaper prices at Wal-mart, Target, or Amazon.com, but it's nice to see and visually everything in one store.

This review is only based on our visit during the Urban Ale Trail.  The District was offering three beers for $4.00.  I don't remember which ones, but they were all good, and I'm not usually a beer person.  They provided snacks including chex mix with the drinks.   The service was good; they had a good DJ with cool songs (not annoying poppy stuff).  There was actually adequate seating, though this was a huge event!

This is my favorite pho place in the valley. Though I live in downtown Phoenix, I sometimes work in the East Valley.   The service is excellent and fast. When we ask for extra limes, they bring them and do not charge extra (some places charge for little things like this).    The pho is in a huge bowl and comes with the usual extras.  I tend to always bring home leftovers, just a tasty the next day.   I've tried a few pho places in the valley, and this is by far the best one.

Nice beautiful quiet spa!   My friend had told me about the Joya Spa a while ago, and I was so excited to go for a facial.   Like many other spas, you can use the facilities on the day of your appointment, before/after.    Location: This is off Lincoln Drive, a beautiful area of the valley. The views from the upstairs pool are quite nice.    Parking: Free in an underground garage.   Amenities: The spa has typical spa goods, the slippers, robe, towels, etc., plus soap, shampoo, conditioner, etc.   There were numerous various waters around, including grapefruit-enhanced, lemon, and cucumber (separate), plus fruit in bowls here and there.  The Whisper room/napping room was a dream!  However, these women were "loud whispering" which kept me up the entire time. The nap room has individual beds with Tempur-Pedic® mattresses.  However the napping room is where the staff members walk through with guests for the treatment rooms - kind of annoying.  The spa includes a sauna, hot tub, cold water deluge, and a resting room with heated stones ( I think? They didn't seem heated).    Pool: If you are a spa guest only, the upstairs pool is your only option. The hotel has other pools, but spa guests can only use the top pool. This pool was OK but pretty small.   Also, the pool is very thick with chlorine, which is to be expected for a public pool, but wow! It is strong. My hair is dry and smells of chlorine even after two washes, and I was not even in the pool that long.    Staff:  Some of the staff were pretty friendly. Others were OK. The server at the pool was super attentive, friendly and nice. She brought us all ice waters and was quick with serving and cleaning up as well.    Food:  While at the pool, I ordered the smoked coconut club which includes grilled flavored tofu, veggies, and more. It was pretty good, but I likely would not order it again.  They had interesting options, like salmon salad, salads, but other foods too.    Services: I had a facial (unsure which one).  It was an excellent experience. Lisa did an amazing job, and I was very comfortable.

This is a really interesting place in Scottsdale. My friend was "chef for a night,"  (she provided recipes, but the main chef still cooked) so I have not been on a regular night. However, the chef seemed really cool and the meal I had there was delicious! Everything was portioned just right, and the spices and oils were not too overwhelming but delicious enough.   The waitress we had the night I went wasn't the friendliest. I would say that's a definite negative. Also the bathroom kind of stunk as well.

Not a fan, but might be for some.   The location has free parking near by in various lots in the shopping / business center.   Service: Meh. I was there with a group and never was asked if I'd like to order something.   Music: Typical popular music. There is a dance floor that looked fun.    Ambiance: This was a fancier type of bar than I prefer. We definitely took time to dress up; most women were in nice pants/tops or dresses.   The crowd was an older crowd (I'm in my mid 30s).  Most individuals were between 45-60, I'm guessing?   Bathrooms: Bring  $$ for tips.

I've been to Postino Central about five times in the last two months.  The atmosphere is a cute little restaurant with large tables for groups and outdoor seating as well. I have gone with small groups of 3-4 and larger groups of 9+, and we are seated within a reasonable amount of time. The outdoor seating can get a bit warm in hotter months, though.  The parking is complimentary (complimentary + tip, actually), so make sure you have some cash on hand, or the Light Rail is just about a block away or less.   The wine selection is nice, although I haven't seen a Chianti on the menu. They also carry hard-to-find beers, such as my favorite, Duval and Raspberry Framboise.  The bruschetta is delicious, and there are interesting choices, such as white bean/tomato/basil and fig/apple/cheese, quite tasty!  Update: Since I wrote this, about 4-5 trips later, again, wow, I'm so impressed with this place. In October, a friend came to visit and we had a party of 15 on a Saturday night. I made reservations, but they had the table ready to go by 6:55 pm and didn't mind that just three of us sat down while waiting for the others. The servers were quite attentive, and I've never had to wait. I recently brought my mom last week, and she described the food as "delicious," and today took part in the 3-5pm $5 happy hour, delish!  Another perk - it's so chill. I noticed many people wearing jeans or shorts at Postino today, yet some people dress up.  The only thing that can be annoying - if you can't find parking or if the valets are done for the day, be careful about where you park in the street. I've had friends who got tickets.

Chill quiet atmosphere.   Parking: Street parking and meters around.    Atmosphere:  Depends on the time.  However, the time we went, it was dark and chill.  There were only about six customers at the time (late Tues night), but I went during a busy happy hour another time.    Service:   The wait staff are attentive but not annoying at all. I liked them!    Food:  We ordered:  Miso soup, edamame, cucumber salad, and my friend ordered salmon sushi.  The miso soup was perfect, and just the right size.   I had never tried the cucumber salad, but it was crisp, slightly spicy and delicious.  My friend convinced me to try sushi again (I ate too much sushi in 2007 and have not recovered yet).  I did try it and surprised myself by enjoying it.    Drinks: We had hot sake and plum wine. Delish!  Cost:  Somehow, with all this food and drinks, our bill was only around $33!  Way to go!

Parking: This is part of a square that includes In 'N Out, Starbucks and Jersey Mikes.  Parking hasn't been an issue for me but suspect it could be busy on other days.   Atmosphere:   Super casual.   Service:   The folks at the front are nice.    Food:  Typical fro yo place, but this one has excellent toppings and seems to be cheaper than ZoYo.  I used to come here almost every Tuesday evening after teaching at a school in Mesa.  The cost was always about $2.37 for a decent amount of fro yo.

It gets the job done, but not a favorite location of mine.  The staff members are incredibly rude and unhelpful.   Parking:  I have only gone in the early morning to this particular gym. The parking on the southeast side of the gym is OK, but later in the day it gets rather busy from what friends have told me.  Trader Joes and Whole Foods have painted signs that state "no health club parking," though doubt people really would know.   Equipment:  It's OK and gets the job done. The cardio machines do not each have their own TV sets like other LA Fitness locations.   The cycle room bikes are often tipsy and/or do not work. I go early to find a bike that works.  The weight equipment seems adequate.   There are quite a few racquetball courts and one basketball court.   The layout is odd - very long and spread out.   Service/staff members:  Terrible service.  I say hi to the people at the front desk. Some ignore me, some grunt a "hi" and look back down at their phones.  I asked one man where the cycle room was the first day at this location. He told me there was no cycle room. I knew there was, as other friends of mine go to this gym. He still really did not know nor really cared.    Classes: I have been to cycle classes only.  They are OK but not as great at the 32nd St/Camelback (Carolyn) or 7th Ave location (Natasha) but it's a workout.     Location: I do like this location for its proximity to Trader Joes, Whole Foods, the Container Store, Frys, and more.  I can shop for groceries post gym.    Cost:  I cannot speak to most, as I got grandfathered in with 24 Hour Fitness, in which I pay only $99 per year for any location in the nation. That transferred to LA Fitness. TO me, that is super cheap. However, for other individuals, I do not know about cost.

This is a fun salon, where my previous hair stylist once worked, and I now I go for pedicures with Jennifer.   The salon is near 20th St and Camelback, which can kind of be a pain to access during busy times.  Parking is covered - yay!   My former hairstylist no longer works there, but she was amazing (she is no longer a hair stylist, hence former).    Currently, I have been at R Salon now twice for amazing pedicures with Jennifer.  I originally had purchased a Living Social deal for $24 for a pedi.  I picked out dark blue with silver sparkles. My toenails looked fresh for over four weeks. Yes, there was growth, but the remaining nail was so well painted, people still were complimenting my "cool" toes six weeks later.   I had another pedi there recently with pink toenails.   Jennifer is friendly, easy to chat with and does a great job on the pedicures. I'll be going back again!

I've come here a few times for a coffee, snack, or lunch. I like this location better than the one a couple blocks north at the Roosevelt Square apartments. This one is cleaner, more organized, and the tables aren't all rickety. Plus, they have more seating, or so it seems. The food and sweets are the same at both locations. Fair Trade is a nice option for lunch versus all the other quick serve cafes that are in this area.   I've had various cookies, brownies, and iced coffees and tea at both locations. They are all delicious, and sometimes there are unique options, such as today was a curry/peanut butter/chocolate cookie. I don't know that I could taste any curry, but the cookie is very delicious.  For lunch, I typically get a hummus/veggie sandwich, and they really pack it with some mixed greens, spinach, tomatoes, and some spicy hummus. My friend ordered the chicken sandwich and said it was great too.   The location is nice, because although it's in downtown Phoenix, it is downstairs, so there's not the excess noise of traffic or anything. You can choose to sit inside or outside.   Also, the music choices at both locations are always excellent. Today I heard Frightened Rabbit and The National while eating my lunch.   The only complaints I have is that it can seem pricey if you order a few things, and also, depending on day, it can be kind of slow to get your order. Also, I purchased gift cards for some people at this location, and they have told me I can only use them here, versus at both locations. That kind of stinks, since I like going to both.

I'll be back soon!  Parking: There is a small lot in front. I went on a Sunday afternoon but suspect on weekday afternoons, it could be tricky to get in/out just due to location.      Atmosphere:   Super casual. There are a couple TVs inside that had sports on, and there is a sign outside that states "Wi fi."     Service:   The wait staff were incredibly friendly and nice. They also were not annoying at all and did not rush us.    Food:  The soup is what I test Thai restaurants with. The lemongrass vegetable soup was delicious, spicy and hot.  I asked for medium spicy and that's exactly the spice I got!  I also ordered sticky rice, and it was as it should be.  The guy I was with got some kind of pork curry and said it was perfect.  He was able to get brown rice with this.    Drinks: I had water and jasmine tea.  The jasmine tea was hot and appropriately flavored.

I know it is ridiculous to spend $60 on a top for working out and $80-100 on pants for exercise.  That said, the products last quite some time, are well worth it and are designed with yoga and running workouts in mind.  My workouts range from Bodyrock with tons of jumping and lots of sweating to spin to yoga, so the workout gear from Lulu fits just fine.   The tanks don't chafe, the ones with built-in bras actually work really well, and the pants/capris are fabulous.  The bags I have purchased through Lulu seem to have been tested by women for a while before finally getting it right with numerous pockets, pouches, and helpfully designed features that make them perfect.   I usually get my products from Lulu online but went into the store since I needed some capris before a trip the next day.  The capris were a huge hit. I live in Phoenix, and the studio capris were incredibly light weight and a now-everyday wear item.    The staff were all super friendly, although also a bit hovering and constantly asking if I needed a dressing room (better than no staff and having to wait for a room though!)  The store is well designed with easy access and easy to find sizes and helpful staff in every corner.  The stores sometimes have more colors and options than what is online.  I didn't see the sale rack, and I need to ask next time!   This location offers the free yoga, running, and cross fit classes during the week.  The cons: Lulu's final sale items are final sale and non-returnable. So, if you choose something from the final sale, try it on, check for shoddy stitching and anything else funky.  The return policy is really strict.  An item that was regular price can be returned within 14 days of the original purchase date. All tags must be still attached.  From what I read on some of the Lululemon fan blogs, the quality has gone down hill after the manufacturing started in other locations besides the original Canada location.  Also bright colors and dark colors have bled. I had a dark Ta Ta Tamer (love the bra!) bleed onto a bright green tank.  I also had a pop orange cool racerback bleed onto a towel when sweating it out at the gym. I did follow all the specific detailed laundry rules too!

I lived in Chandler for almost two years and used this gym almost daily.  It is never that crowded, even on a Saturday morning or a later afternoon gym run. The machines sometimes aren't all working, but there is a maintenance guy there often. I like how the cycles are available in the empty aerobics room if there isn't a class going on.  The weights and weight machines are pretty decent and again, not that crowded most of the time.  The staff at this location are the friendliest (IMO) among the other 24 Hour Fitness locations in the valley. The front desk people are always saying hello and the manager is friendly too.  Many of the Group X classes are a lot fun. I miss when the true yogi yoga instructor taught there. Her classes were amazing.    Some of the personal trainers I would never ask to purchase sessions from. One of them walks like he is too cool for school and I attended a boot camp led by some of the male trainers, and it became a competition between two of them on who could do ladders the fastest.  The female trainers and some of the male trainers look competent and their training sessions don't look so cookie-cutter-like, as the rest of the trainers.   The location of this gym is not in the best area of the city, although decent. When I used to go here, I'd buy groceries at the WalMart there after.

I go to Rip's only when Obscura is happening, the second Saturday of each month.  I don't know if it's only during Obscura, but drinks are way cheaper than other bars, between $3-$5. I'm not sure how they determine that, as some bartenders only charge me $3 and others $5.  Sometimes there are (kind of annoying) drink promoters there handing out such fun things as footballs and key chains and shots of whatever drink they are promoting.    Obscura is a fun time for people who like good music. As in good music, I mean cool music that is considered "indie" and/or Brit pop, good stuff from the 90s. The DJ Roya and DJ Funkfinger always bring a good show. Obscura also features prizes from a raffle. I have never won, but at least one or more of my friends wins each time. The prizes include new release CDs, tickets to shows, etc.   Rip's also has numerous other theme nights, but I have not been yet. I'm sure those might be just as fun. I get invites from their Facebook account for 80s night and other theme nights.   I will definitely be back in the next months during Obscura.

I spotted Thai House while driving on Shea one evening.  I love Thai food, and my friend who is gluten free noted their menu provided many gluten free options.   The restaurant is located in a little shopping center and is a medium sized restaurant.  I ordered the Tom Yum (as usual) and some curry with green beans, carrots, and potatoes.  I was pleasantly surprised at the perfect "sneaky spicy" of all of it.  The curry dish was humongous, and after dining in, I will have at least four more meals out of it.  The Tom Yum cup of soup was also a very large cup and was more like a bowl. The prices were normal for this type of food.  We went on a Saturday evening, rather early, and the service was excellent.   My friend ordered the green curry with seafood. She raved about her food and enjoyed the brown rice option.   The service was an issue this past evening when my friend and I were craving Thai food. The wait staff saw us, and 20 minutes passed without one waitress asking us what we'd like to order.  They were rather busy, but we stayed for the 20 minutes and we were completely ignored!  The table of people who had come in at the same time were giving their orders a few minutes after they arrived. I don't know why we wasted so much time, but we left after we were again ignored by the wait staff.

Great food and service, love the location.  This place is almost always busy, though sometimes I can get in there mid to late afternoon during a slow-down.   I often get the iced tea and try a baked good.  The bakery items vary from day to day.  I've tried cornbread, cookies, and an apple tart - all very delicious.    You can purchase coffee beans here too.     There's free wifi, plenty of tables and rows of seats for us loners who like to just sit, sip, snack and work on the laptop.

This is for Leah Smith - nail artist.    The location has adequate street parking.  The salon is in a cute little house.   I do not get many manicures ever. I think I've had five in my life. Anyway, the gel manicure was amazing, and Leah created a cool ombre effect on the nails with pink and silver sparkles.  She painted birds on my accent nails.   Leah is super friendly, and it was fun to get my nails done.

Reliable, tasty food, good prices, great for groups.   Since I moved downtown in 2010, I have frequented the location of PJ quite often.  This location does not take reservations, but I have been with groups of 7 to 25 people, and they were reasonable and helped us find tables together.  Or, there's a large table towards the front where large groups can sit together.  I had a graduation party there, meetups, and birthday parties with excellent service. The wait staff doesn't hover and make us feel like we have to leave immediately after eating.   Food: Hummus is ok, soups are usually quite tasty. The happy hours specials are nice.  The veggie wrap is usually very good but have ordered a few that were bland.    Service: Usually quite efficient and helpful. Sometimes a table may have one server and multiple individuals coming by with food, but I have not had any issues.  They also don't make us feel like we need to leave ASAP if we are just chatting or hanging out.   Atmosphere: This location is surprisingly not busy as often as I thought it'd be.   There is an outdoors patio, nice in the spring and winter.  The inside has booths and tables, plus a bar area.

Multiple shipping services available, friendly employees, fast service, products available.  I love not having to stand in line for 15-20 minutes at the Post Office! The UPS Store offers a variety of shipping options and will help you find the cheapest option. I've been in there probably four-five times in the last two years, and every employee has been very friendly and helpful. They also sell cards, supplies, poster tubes, etc.

I come here for meetings almost once per week or once every two weeks. I got in the morning between 8:30-9:30 and stay for a while. The servers are all very friendly. I noticed one of the servers remembers people from before, and in-between rush orders, they are often cleaning up the area.   A major plus for this location is that they have lots of seating and lots of plug-ins for those of us who use our laptops.  There are several small tables, a larger table, and tables by the comfortable bench area.   The only complaints I have is that it's often busy, I cannot get a seat, and sometimes, the tables are crummy with someone's previous snack. Also, the sun is so darn bright in there at times. Of course, the sun annoys me most of the time anyway, but the shades on the windows only come about halfway down, and the sun is blinding. The parking lot can be kind of annoying too, depending on when one gets there/leaves.   If you log into their (now) free wifi, there's a free song of the week. I have liked all my free songs of the week, a perk of going to Starbucks.   I can't say I love Starbucks coffee, but I love their tea and option of snacks. They have the kind of granola bars I like, dark chocolate, fruit, and some other items that are quite tasty.   The music is often the same every week I go, and sometimes it can get overly loud, but it's not that bad.

Parking:  Decent in the morning, but during evening classes, I have parked on some of the side streets near by, since all of the spots were taken.   Staff:  Excellent! I met Mike Jones in the fall and was thoroughly impressed; he is a great example for a fitness studio. He was friendly and helpful related to the pricing schedules.  I attend spin classes with Andi and Lisa.  Andi's classes are challenging, always on time and to the exact minute (5:30 to 6:30 and sometimes a bit over). Her playlists range from old school to 1970s to fun pop.  Lisa's classes are also challenging and add some abs towards the end. Her playlists are mostly pop, R&B, and sometimes she makes a theme mix.   Atmosphere:  The spin classes are fun!  I haven't attended any other classes but have only heard good things.  People are friendly.  The bikes are from the former gym Core Balance Studio that closed. The Real Ryders are tough bikes in which to cycle.  However, they really make a high intensity workout!   Cost: There are always specials. I buy the x amount of classes per whatever cost. The unlimited would be too much for me, based on my location and other gym memberships.  The cost is much cheaper than say, Madison Improvement Club.    Schedule:  The schedule is good for my needs. However, if I attended more regularly, I would prefer more early AM classes.

I have now been to Pom Cafe maybe 4-5 times.  There are numerous interesting dishes on the menu, and most of the dishes are heaping with food, so the prices are not that bad.  The veggies are fresh and delicious, and I love the hummus.  I've also ordered some of the rice and tofu and was impressed, although it could have been a bit more spicy.  I've ordered the hummus with bagel that also comes with veggie chips - very filling and tasty.  I need to branch out and order more things the next times I visit.  One of my friends is picky and vegan, and she now frequents this place quite often.  I recently ordered a salad with kale, and whatever the dressing that was on the kale was the most delicious dressing I have tasted in a while!  I have also ordered a veggie wrap with the "cheese" made from nuts (I think).  It was deliciously flavorful and interesting. The flax crackers that came with it weren't really enough, maybe 25 kcal worth. I also have tried their sweet stuff, and the homemade granola bars and cheesecake bites are fresh and tasty.   The staff members are always friendly and happy to chat for a few minutes when picking up orders or trays.   There are a few things that could make the place even better.  If it's busy, be prepared to wait for a while for the food.  Sometimes the portions are big and then sometimes they are small. I was expecting a deliciously large veggie plate like last time (normal size plate) but instead got a cake-sized plate with maybe 1/2 cup veggies  and hummus.  Also, some items are pre-mixed, and peppers make me rather sick. I have to pick them out or order something else.  Sometimes, or often, things are forgotten in an order, so make sure to check before leaving.   Pomengranate has expanded the menu since my review in August or whenever, and they now have dinner. I noticed on Facebook that they have pet happy hour, which is cool for people who have dogs.

Meh - this is just an OK Starbucks.  Average service, not great seating, and the parking lot is a mess.   I have been to this location numerous times.  I used to come here to work on my laptop during graduate school. Parking is a headache, since it shares the lot with Pei Wei and is on the corner of 7th Ave and McDowell.    The service is average and can be less than average at times. This morning, my friend and I went to get some coffee. The cashier had to ask us about our coffees several times; it wasn't a complicated order.  He entered my friend's coffee order in incorrectly.  The person making the coffees was distracted by a friend while making the coffees.   The coffee itself is fine - it's Starbucks.    The seating isn't much, so I don't come here to work anymore.

I've only had lunch here, but I am impressed.   I ordered Tom Yum, even though it wasn't on the lunch menu. The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing. Then again, my friend and I were the only ones there at an odd lunch time of  2-something. The choices looked tasty, but Tom Yum is my go-to at any Thai place. My friend ordered green curry, and she said it was delicious.   The Tom Yum had the usual mushrooms, carrots and lemongrass flavoring. This one also had some peppers and broccoli added. I ordered rice with it, and everything was very tasty and the spice was just right. Also the price was just right. I was expecting a $10-12 meal ticket, and they only charged $4.95 for the soup & rice!

I think I could eat here every day if I had more money. As a vegetarian with a gluten free friend, we found a perfect place. The restaurant caters to individuals who have food allergies and/or who don't eat meat. The waiter also asked us first thing about any intolerances, allergies, etc and was cool about it, versus other restaurants where a person might have 3-4 choices only.   We went during brunch time on a Sunday, but I like how they also offer the lunch/dinner menu too. I ordered fruit salad (mango, pineapple, black- and blue-berries) and tortilla soup. The tortilla soup was great - veg based, spicy broth with black beans and avocado. The serving sizes are also perfect. The waiter said "we don't like to overfeed people." I'd agree that it was just right. My friend ordered quinoa pasta with meatballs and enjoyed it. I saw sooo many other things on the menu that I would like to try.   The parking can be confusing if you have not been before, but the Nourish.com web site outlines how to get there. I had been to Posh a few weeks before so was aware of the parking garage.

Wow, this place is great! I ordered the heirloom tomato salad and the vegetarian pizza. My uncle who dined with me ordered stuffed mushrooms and tilipia. Everything was extremely tasty and the service was great. It is a very small little place, so I had made reservations. The menu has interesting salads, apps, main dishes, and the wine was delicious as well, although I'm not sure what it was.  The chef actually comes to speak to each customer about the wine and dishes. I love this place, and it helps that it's in my apartment building!  My second visit included the white bean appetizer, which is apparently new. I wouldn't say I loved it, but it was unique. There were warm greens, with onion and white beans, bread with hummus, and cold white beans with green beans and red peppers. It's totally vegetarian but just OK.  I tried the margherita pizza this time, and of course the crust is satisfying again (tasty heated up again in the toaster oven). The vinegar on the pizza was a delicious touch. I only had one piece of pizza, since we also shared the tilapia that comes with shrimp risotto. The risotto was much better than I expected with a coconut flavor and the shrimp were cooked correctly with a lot of spice. The tilapia was as flavorful and properly cooked as before. The web site LocalDines provides gift cards for the Centurion - pay $25 for a $50 card - nice!  Do note that since it is a tiny restaurant, you will smell like restaurant and food and cooking upon leaving, unless you choose to sit outside.  It's not a bad thing if it doesn't bother you, but it's something that is hard for me to ignore!

A fun experience, but an expensive one!   Parking: This is in Heritage square, so there are paid parking garages near by. We walked, since we live downtown.   Service: Fantastic and attentive. That said, my friend knows everyone at every restaurant downtown so that makes it a bit nicer.     Drinks: Interesting, tasty concoctions.   Food: Tiny appetizer portions, but everything is delicious and carefully made. The wait staff will explain everything.  There are oysters, shrimp, and tuna, other fish - based foods.

Fro yo is tasty!   The Zoyo fro yo shop has the typical set up of these types of fro yo shops.  This is not my usual Zoyo (I go to the one off 7th Ave and McDowell usually).    This location is nicely spread out where one doesn't feel cramped near the fro yo machines and plenty of seating indoors and out. There were TVs with children-based movies and TV shows on at the time (a later Saturday evening around 9pm), but that seemed to fit the crowd. Most the folks in at that time were families with children.   The toppings at this location are similar to most any other.  One can get sample cups.   Zoyo offers a rewards program, so I had earned my $5 for free fro yo! woohoo!

Excellent service, ample parking, delicious food and drink.   Parking: one can find a spot near Zipp's bar, or in the parking lot to the west of the restaurant if there aren't any near the restaurant.   Service: Amazing! The hostess who greeted us was nice and efficient. The servers were both super friendly and chatty.  Other folks came by a bunch to refill our waters.  Yet, the servers did not rush us to leave.   Drinks: I got a sangria; it was rather strong and bursting with fruit flavor.   Food: I ordered the grilled cheese and roasted tomato soup.  The grilled cheese was toasty and light. The soup had a lot of flavor and spice. The serving size was perfect - small but filling (for me!)  The food came out within 20 minute or so.  The guy I was with ordered chicken and said it was good. However, he initially wanted salmon, and they were out.  The s'mores have bacon (I do not eat bacon), and I really wanted to try them. But, instead I got peach cobbler; it was good!   We also got a pumpkin something, and it was good but overly sweet.   I'd love to come back!

Another tasty fun Upward Projects restaurant!   Location: just north of Camelback and Central near the other Upward Projects restaurants. Parking can be problematic at certain times. Though the lot to the south of Windsor is large, it has been full, and valet also has a max. Sometimes I've parked at AJs and walked up.   Food:  Though salad restaurants are usually yawnnn.., the Windsor salads are vibrant, interesting and flavorful.  I have ordered various salads and am always glad I did.  I enjoyed the pretzel appetizer with cheese and apples. I think it came with sausage but did not eat that.  The drinks have always been delicious and well made.   Service: Similar to the other Upward Projects restaurants, service is excellent.   The servers provide the bill in a timely manner and are helpful and quick.   Ambiance: trendy, hipster, fun.    I like it!

Good service, easy parking, delicious light pizza.  Parking: Teeny tiny little lot shared with another restaurant.  We parked on the street.   Atmosphere: Medium to loud / fun.  It's pretty small inside.   Service:  The wait staff are attentive, yet they were a bit hovering.    Food:  I ordered a vegetable-based pizza. It was crisp, cheesy, and delicious.  I also ordered the cold garlic green beans; I did not like them much.  My friend ordered calamari as his app but did not share, so I have no idea.  He did enjoy his sangria.    Drinks: I have only had water so don't know if drinks are good or not.

Funky little spot on 7th street with friendly servers and excellent food!   I enjoyed Green in Tempe and was excited when the Phoenix location opened.   Parking: This is one problem area of this location. Parking is tight.  There is likely street parking around the area.   Service with a smile: The employees are always friendly.    Food: Amazing!  This is vegetarian comfort food.  I have ordered almost every salad and bowl on the menu. Some veg-based places skimp on flavor and spice, but Green knows what it is doing!

I learned about H 'n F from Dr. Hummus, Junior (Ovi) who sells hummus at some of the farmers markets around town.   The restaurant location is behind the Burger King, which can be somewhat tricky to find sometimes for newbies.  The restaurant has numerous options, so meat and non-meat eaters can enjoy the food.  A friend of mine attends school nearby and she has numerous food allergies. She said all of her food choices have been specifically gluten free, and they get it right for the most part.   I like how the menu has variety, but some of the things confuse me (such as the kung pao pasta).  There are so many things that it's hard to choose - hummus, salads, pizza, pastas, and now tamales (which are rather delicious) & more.   Everything I have eaten is delicious. I really enjoy the veggie wrap, and the cook actually takes one's preferences and makes the food as ordered. The lentil soup is just as it sounds - nothing interesting but pretty tasty.  The portions are typically rather huge, so be prepared with some to-go food after you're finished.    One thing that irritated me once was the lack of specific teas.  The menu listed all these interesting teas, and I was looking forward to some hot tea. The server gave me some plain Fresh 'n Easy brand tea and told me he could not find anything else.   I am not a fan of places that advertise all these things then don't have them or charge me the same for the tea that was not what was advertised.   Depending on who's serving you will depend on service. I've had good servers and unimpressive servers too.    Sometimes at the farmers markets at the Dr. Hummus booth, you can get $5 off coupons for meals, and (usually), the server doesn't give one the stink eye for using a coupon.  They tend to have specials from time to time, like free kids' meals on mother's day (or something like that).    The owner, Sabeur is very friendly and often talks to customers while you're there.

A dine-in theater with OK seats, meh food, yet friendly servers.   Location: This is in far north Scottsdale. Parking is easy; the lot provides adequate spaces.   Seating: For some reason, I thought the seats would be more comfortable. The options are seats in front of a long bar/desk type thing with office-like seats, and there are other seats that have a roll out small table for each person.   Food: Overpriced and meh.  That said, the pretzel bites were tasty, though the cheese with them was stale and a bit greasy.  The pizza was just OK but tasted bland to me.    Servers: The service was efficient, but we had very few napkins and had to request a box twice.   All in all, I'd attend movies at other theaters.

Great service, excellent location and interesting drinks!   This is a small restaurant within CityScape. My first visit was during the Urban Ale Trail in September, but we just got beer, no food.   I went with a friend to grab some late night dinner on a Sunday night. I ordered a quinoa vegetable-based dish. It was better than I expected with some interesting spice.  The friend ordered some kind of marinara-based noodles and they were ok, but typical.  The drinks were delicious.    The server returned often and was friendly.

Fro yo at Zoyo is always a treat!   This particular location is a frequent stop for me post work or after a long day.    There are the usual numerous tasty flavors, like Insta-Graham and Cake Batter.  This particular location is usually well - staffed, though sometimes a staff member cannot be found when ready to check out.    The parking can be crowded, depending on time of day.

Good friend, great views, terrible service.  I have been here twice now.  I went around 7pm on a Saturday in January. It was perfect weather for the fun  rooftop bar. The servers were OK but similar to some other reviews, indifferent and then later, took over 30 minutes to get us our bills and over 30 minutes to return the credit cards.    Some friends and I came to Lustre during happy hour on a day where few people were around. The bartender acted as though we were annoying him, as I asked about if we should order at the bar or at a table. He had just two people at the bar; it was not busy.  The server was OK but not great, not friendly.   She took quite some time with bills during this date as well.    Food:  OK - flat bread pizzas, salads, cheese, chips/dip.    View: Great! Fun to see all of downtown from here.   Service: Needs improvement.   I'd maybe go again when I have a lot of time to wait for servers to acknowledge our presence and to bring back the bills.

Have fun while you workout!    This nice little studio above Moda Fina offers spin (Real Ryder - the bikes move side to side), yoga, barre, and core fusion classes. There is also a personal trainer there (Todd) who has had many years of experience.  I have only taken Real Ryder classes and a Pilates class so can only write about these classes.   The Real Ryder classes are really hard workouts, so expect to sweat, but also expect to have fun!  The Real Ryder bikes have very heavy flywheels and also move, which allows you to work your core.  I typically work at a higher intensity level than a regular gym spin class.  Also, each instructor brings his or her unique music and style to the class.  If you enjoy hip hop/rap/R&B, there's a live DJ class on Mon/Weds nights at 5:30pm with Todd and DJ T-Last.  I like all the instructors there, and the owner, Grant is very friendly.  Most all of the instructors introduce themselves to newbies and help with any type of set up one might need.  The barre/core fusion classes seem to fill up rather quickly, and I have heard they are great.    The studio offered almost two months of free classes, which was a nice way to check out what was going on here. I purchased a bulk package of classes, rather than an unlimited, since I belong to other gyms.   The prices are high, but that's typical of any type of nice studio like this.  The yoga studio where I usually go is slightly cheaper but does not offer the variety that CoreBalance has.    Other perks include towel service and Sparkletts water.  There are towels on each bike, and one can get tasty water from the Sparkletts' dispensers (rather than seeing a gross loogie in a gym's water fountain!)   The studio is a cheerful orange and gray inside with lots of light coming into the workout rooms.   The schedule has a lot of different times, and I was happy to have a 5:30 am on some mornings when I have a busy day.   Getting there during late afternoon traffic has proven to be an annoyance (it's around 32nd/Camelback, a very busy area), but the early mornings and weekends offer some class times. They continue to expand their selection as well.  Another nice thing is there's no false information provided from the gym.   One of my pet peeves is that some gyms go beyond their scopes of practice and offer services (i.e. nutrition) without expert qualifications. It's nice to see this studio focused on their classes and great instructors. However, I did notice that they recently started selling raspberry ketones (non - evidenced based) and some sort of other nutrition supplement products. I realize they're money makers... but don't like those kind of things.

A favorite downtown bar for me!   Location: This is on 2nd street and a bit hard to find if you don't know. The sign faces south. There is street or metered parking nearby. I am able to walk!  Food:  This is more than just bar food. I have had some of the salads, the hummus, pretzels, peanut butter sandwich, and the homemade poptart.  Everything has been tasty! The pizzas are excellent!  The pretzels are probably one of my favorites. They come with mustard and cheese.  I have also had the fries with gravy (not a fan).   Drink: Multiple local / regional beers are featured, and the cider on tap changes daily.  I absolutely love the ginger cider and the cherry cider. One can order flights of beers of their choice.   Service: For a busy bar, the service is quite good.  I have been at least seven times in the last year, and every single time, the server is checking up on us numerous times. The servers are friendly and helpful also.   Ambiance: There are TVs near the bar, and there's an outside patio area for when it's nice out. They have some games out there, like corn hole ( I hate that name!)   This place can get packed on Thursday and Friday evenings and weekends too.

A fun chill bar with tasty bar food.   Parking: Street parking and meters.  We had taken an Uber to get to Tempe and walked over from the ASU Gammage after a show.    Atmosphere:  Depends on the time.  We went on a Sunday at around 2:45 PM.  It was not too crowded but more people came later.  There were sports on in the inside portion of the bar (none of us care). We sat outside on the patio.    Service:   The wait staff are attentive but not annoying.  Food:  I ordered the soft pretzels (what I order at almost every bar).  They were delicious. We also ordered fries. My friend got a hot dog and seemed to relish it. My other friend ordered some veggie-based burger.   Drinks: Cider per usual. Crisp, cold and I drank all of it.

Super unique funky place to grab tasty cold treats.   The texture of snoh really is like a light weight snow, though I haven't felt snow in ages, unfortunately.    Location:  In the same shopping center as a Cherry Blossom, a tasty restaurant.  The parking lot can get crowded midday for lunch time.    Food/drinks: Snoh offers the snoh treats and iced teas with the bubbles.  The snoh treats are interesting and unique with the base snoh treat, then toppings, plus the icing. For example, I got the coconut snoh, my topping included Oreos, and the icing was caramel. I know, a bit of an odd selection.   Service: The employees were friendly for the most part. However, one person had a complaint, and the employee was arguing about the situation.  But, it was taken care of with free food.    Ambiance: Funky - games, interesting artwork and TVs on.

This is specific to the 7th Ave and Camelback location.  I was grandfathered in when LA Fitness bought out all the 24Hour Fitness locations. This is a good thing, since I pay hardly anything per year and now have more gym locations to attend.    The location is rather busy in the afternoon!   However, in the early morning, it's rather easy to find a machine.  I do not look forward to new year's resolution busy times.   Group ex classes: I've tried Tasha's cycle classes. These are tons of fun. Plus, the bikes have computers on them, so one can see his/her heart rate, RPMs, and wattage.   I tried a yoga class but was not that impressed.   The instructor did not walk around and help people in the poses.    The restroom is always clean, and there is ample space in the locker room.  There is a sauna in the locker room as well.    I wouldn't say the employees are trying too hard to be friendly, really. They say hi and that's about it.

This cute little breakfast/lunch establishment is always bustlin', though I got lucky at a 9 am time slot on Monday morning with no wait!   Location/parking: This is downtown Phoenix, so there's some street parking and meters near by.  I live close enough to walk.  If you're waiting, you will likely wait outside.   Variety: Not a huge menu but typical breakfast offerings of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, and breakfast sandwich. There's an option with egg whites and vegetables.   Food:  I ordered the cheese omelet with potatoes and toast.  The omelet was perfect and cooked just right - a basic cheese omelet with my choice of cheese.  The potatoes were delicious, but some were not cooked at all. They were flavored with rosemary. There are various options for toast; I chose sourdough. They brought it with delicious jam.   Service: Efficient and quick.  Most everyone was friendly.   Ambiance/noise level: It's going to be busy likely, and it's cramped, so it's not super quiet but I could still hear everything.   All in all, a good experience!

I have enjoyed the Tempe Z'Tejas for years. This one is in a unwalkable area, but it was just as tasty!  Location:  Near a strip mall of sorts. Tons of parking available.   Variety: It's typical tex mex types of food.  There are quesadillas, tacos, salads, etc.  Though one can make a meal vegetarian or vegan, it isn't as easy as other places.   Service: Quick, efficient and friendly.   Food quality:  Everyone talks about the chambord margaritas- these are an absolute must have!  Also, one is adequate!  The food itself is good, but I wouldn't say it's anything special. I go for the margaritas!   Ambiance: This is a quieter location than Tempe's location.  It was pretty quiet.

This is a nice welcome change to the choices of restaurants for the Downtown Phoenix ASU campus.    I've been quite a few times during busy times during lunch and off times such as 2/3 pm.    I've had the bagel sandwich, Del Rio, a couple of salads, and the rice bowl.  All have been pretty good.  The Del Rio sandwich sometimes has lacked all the ingredients listed on the menu.  The bagel sandwich (one bagel with hummus and the other with guacamole) is huge.  It is not good leftover though.  The rice bowl has an interesting taste and is pretty filling.   I've ordered side vegetables which are tasty.    The baked goods have been hit or miss. The dark chocolate cookie looked good but had no flavor whatsoever.  The carrot cake cookie sandwich was very good though.   The service is sometimes good, sometimes really rude.  The cashiers are sometimes rude.  Sometimes they are nice.  The last few times I went, the cashiers act like I'm annoying them by just being there and ordering food.  Almost every time I've been, something has been left off my order. The last time something was missing, the guy brought it and just slammed it down on the table. Thanks!

I'm so glad this new Whole Foods is in this location!  This location on 20th St and Highland is perfect, since it's kind of close to one of my spin studios, so I can finally make an early morning WF run.   The store is similar to other WF stores. It's much smaller than the one in PV or Chandler but has everything I need.  The kale / other produce are local, and the juice bar and prepared foods are delicious.  The produce is always top notch, and I prefer purchasing all my produce here.    The cashiers/employees are mostly pretty friendly but aren't as friendly as say Trader Joes (who always say Hi!)

Excellent service, good food, fun atmosphere.   This place has quite a few options for veggie and meat eaters alike.   I have been here during happy hour about four times in the last four months.  Most of the food I've ordered has been great.  The edamame is as usual - salty and basic.  The chips and guac are excellent!  The flatbreads are just meh - no flavor / boring!  The mac and cheese is creamy and delicious!   I tried the fish tacos - they come with a lot of tacos!  There were four tacos that included fish, slaw, and some dipping sauce. Each taco was double wrapped.  It was very filling.   The sangrias are in pink, white, and red. All three are super tasty.    Service: Excellent, quick and friendly!    Parking: street parking and valet.   One time, and organization in which I'm involved had an event here. It was Ok but kind of a pain, since more people we were expecting showed up. I think the Vig was annoyed with us but tried to accommodate.    Sometimes Localdines.com has deals here - go for it!

Huge salads and hot doughy pretzels.   Parking: This is part of Whole Foods. Easy parking in front.   Atmosphere:   Super casual. The bar had several TVs with sports on.   Service:   The wait staff are attentive but the service was very slow.  It took maybe 20 minutes for our app and another 40 minutes for the food.  That said, the wait staff were mostly friendly, though some were a bit apathetic.   Food:  We ordered soft pretzels with cheese and mustard. I love pretzels and definitely enjoyed these.  I ordered a salad that had pomengranate seeds, oranges, and cheese. It was HUGE. I felt like 45 minutes later, I was still eating salad. The guy I was with ordered the orange chicken but stated it wasn't that great.    Drinks: Various beers and other drinks.

Pretty fun modern Mexican place with specials.   Parking:  The location is near Postino, Federal Pizza, and Windsor, and parking can be a pain. There are plenty of lots, but these places can get busy. There's a lot across the street near Windsor if the lots near Joyride are full.   Location: Just north of Central and Camelback - a quick walk from the light rail station at this location.  Specials: There are happy hour specials from 2-6pm with pretty good deals and $5 margaritas.   Food:  The food options are good. The guac is always delicious. The happy hour tacos are only $2 but are made with a pre-made mix. I asked for no peppers, but the server said the mix is already made.  The chips/salsa are just OK.  The salad options look pretty interesting but haven't had one before.   I ordered the Mexican corn for something new - pretty tasty!  Service:  Usually good, though I've only been here twice.   The crowd is similar to the other Upward Projects restaurant crowd.  Sign up for the Upward Projects coupons for a free app, though I'd use the coupon at Postino

Trendy downtown bar with excellent service, drinks and food!   One of my friends mentions this place at least every time I see him, so I was glad to try the place.  Seating was easy; we had five in our group, and we initially were seated at a high top table but later were moved elsewhere to fit another group.  The employee who moved us gave us some tasty little drinks after he moved us.   The service was outstanding on the busy Saturday evening I went. Servers came by multiple times, were friendly, helpful and efficient.     The drinks are interesting and unique and rather large.  I only tried the popcorn and enjoyed it. I didn't have anything else.

Delicious fresh ice cream.   I had purchased SR ice cream at Whole Foods in the pints before and was excited to see the other flavors.   There were some ice cream flavors and gelato as well.    The prices are higher than most ice cream places - $3.50 for a tiny scoop - but well worth it.  The chocolate chip mint is one of my favorites. There are actual pieces of mint chopped up into this ice cream.  Last time, I branched out and tried something new, the peanut butter chocolate.  It was delicious.   The service was fast and friendly when I went. There aren't a lot of seats inside, but on a Tuesday evening at 8pm, we found a couple seats together.  They have outdoor seating as well.   There is free water near the door.

A sporty bro - kinda place!  This includes a driving range, bar, and food.    Parking: Plenty of parking, but wow this place gets busy.   Wait time: It varies.  I came on a Friday afternoon, and we waited about 90 minutes. I have heard wait times on weekends can be 3-5 hours.    Bar:  Basic bar. Nothing special.   Food:  I did not try any of the meals, but we ate the donut holes. They were a fun choice - donut holes with syringes to insert raspberry, cream, and chocolate.     Entertainment: There are TVs everywhere, in case one cannot pull him/herself away from whatever sporting event is happening that day. Prices range, dependent on the time of day - cheaper earlier, more pricier after 5pm.   I am terrible at golf but had fun with friends. I'd likely not go back, less it's for someone's event.

Delicious healthy options with a nice layout!   Location: 44th and Camelback area near the Village. The parking can be problematic during busy, or rather, most times! I often park near the AJs.   Food: Wow! I love the food here. The healthy options are endless, and meat eaters, vegans, and vegetarians can find foods they enjoy.  Individuals who follow gluten free diets are also happy with the numerous GF options.    I have eaten here at lunch and dinner.  I usually order the vegetable & grains mix and match.  I have specifically enjoyed the spiced cauliflower, the GF mac and cheese, broccoli, soba noodles, and the sweet potatoes.  The spiced cauliflower is a favorite.  The interesting teas have free refill stations towards the east side of the restaurant.   The prices are higher than most counter-based service restaurants; however, the food is high quality and healthy.   Service: The service is OK. It's often crowded, but the food comes out quickly.  I wouldn't say it's overly friendly but not rude either - just average.

Interesting unique dishes, excellent service, and fun decor!   My friend and I stopped here on the way home from a cycle class at CycleBar. We were both pretty hungry!  The place was not too busy on a Sunday morning at around 11/11:30 am but suspect it's packed later in the day/evening.   The decor was fun and interesting with brightly colored pillows and cushions on the booths.    Our waitress was attentive and detailed with the menu information.  I had decided on an omelet that included mushrooms. The waitress let me know that the mushrooms are very smoky and to make sure I really liked the smoky flavor (I do not). So, instead, she was able to let me make a custom made veggie-omelet. It was so good; it included mushrooms (not smoked), spinach, and tomatoes.   My friend ordered one of the sushi dishes and the duck/green tea waffle combination.   She enjoyed all of her food.   I suspect the parking could be an issue later in the day/evening. This is in a tight shopping center, with apartments to the north.

Simple but often healthy food.   Parking: Street parking and meters around, or use the CityScape garage and get validated for free parking.   Atmosphere:  Depends on the time.  It can be super quiet on a weekday afternoon, or super busy during an evening when there is an event near there, such as Meet Me Downtown.      Service:   Quick.   Food:  I have gone here a few times for the last two or three years. I like the simplicity of the vegetable salads and sandwiches.  Most people I have taken here can find something to eat as well (meat eater friends).    Drinks: There are bottled drinks to order, or fountain drinks.

Tasty food, quick service, and a great location!   I'm partial to this location, since I just live down the street!   This is a quiet little spot near St. Joe's hospital off Thomas.  We were the only ones in the restaurant at the time we visited.   The waitress was attentive but not super friendly.   The food: excellent, hot, and well-spiced (well, except the vegetable rolls).    The spring vegetable rolls were crisp and tasty, along with some delicious peanut sauce.  I had a history of these with friends who made them homemade in the 1990s, and these were a close recipe!   I ordered a vegetable stir-fry. The waitress said I could specify vegetables to be removed from the dish.  They were out of sticky rice (sadness) but I love jasmine rice.   My friend ordered the curry and loved it.   We'll be back!

Trendy, fun happening place!   Location: This is off Farmer in Tempe.  Parking includes valet and self-parking, plus street parking.  I went on a Monday night; there were ample spots available.   Food:  Lots of interesting choices, like pretzel bites with cheese fondue, hummus, mini cheese sandwiches, cheese plate, salads, popcorn, and more.  I did not eat much at the time, but the pretzels were delicious, warm and soft.   Happy hour offers cheaper prices for drinks and eats.   The sangria on the happy hour menu was just $3.00 for a decent amount. The sangria was one of the best I've had!    Service:  Pretty good for a busy place.  The Yard in Phoenix did not have great service, but our servers were excellent and always checking in on our huge table of over 12 people.   Ambiance: Fun place with seating on long tables with hard chairs or couches in circles.  There are games, like bean bags, ping pong, etc.

I will visit again!    This place has a lot of tasty options.   I had the vegetables that included bamboo shoots and carrots. They were tasty and spicy along with the Jasmine rice.    The service was efficient and friendly.   The location is in walking distance for me.  There are metered parking spots nearby.

This is a great place for groups, since you can grab a huge table, and people can come in and out without reservations or any wait staff buggin' you to leave!   Location: Off Central. Parking: In the pack or street parking.   Service: I have had only positive experiences with the various vendors at this location.  In the summer, I was waiting for a friend at the bar, and the bartender was friendly and chatty while I waited.    In the main area, I have always had good service with the wait staff coming by for drinks etc.    Food: I have tried the Asian place in the back and some of the baked goods at Tea and Toast.  The bento box was tasty, and the server even split it for my friend and me in two separate boxes.   At Tea and Toast, the over priced pop tarts are super tasty, but the sugar cookies are just ok.

Easy to book, friendly service, and great looking lashes!   I was getting lash extensions for about four months; they looked amazing! I have red hair / blonde eyelashes, so these were a nice addition.  Chantel is quick and precise with lash extensions and very careful with one's eyes.  Unfortunately, about 5% of people are allergic to eyelash glue (no matter where one goes). I'm allergic to a million things and later discovered I have an allergy to the glue.   Instead, now I get my lashes tinted with Chantel.  They are not going to look as amazing as extensions, but that's just the way of extensions!  The tinting process is easy and painless.  I have blonde lashes, so it's nice to have tinted lashes for when I go to the gym / do not feel like wearing mascara.   The location is right off the 51 on the north side of Bethany Home in this cute gray building.  The building is cool and smells great.  Everything is clean and professional.  The decor is cute and unique.  Chantel also sells some eye products that are doctor-recommended - eye make up remover and eye lash extension rinse.     There is covered parking, which is lovely in sunny Phoenix.

Extremely slow service, crowded spot!    Parking:  Easy, plenty of spots.   Service:  Apathetic and uncaring.  The barista / cashier barely spoke above a whisper and when I asked how he was, he stated, "crap." I couldn't hear him anyway but then he expanded to tell me how awful he was today.   The guy was so quiet, I had to keep asking what he said.    Wait time: Forever and ever amen.  My iced coffee seriously took over 25 minutes - wow!  Tons of folks were waiting for their coffees.   Food/drinks: Same ole - it's Starbucks.

Fun trendy intimate lounge/bar with games and good drinks.   Initially, this place could be difficult to locate.  To get to the entrance, one has to walk around to the alley behind a deli.  There is a sign, but it's not incredibly prominent.   Walk down the stairs and enter coolness! There's a very small venue for musical acts in one section, and a bar/gameroom in the other section. The music venue also has a bar but wasn't serving snacks when  I was there.   The venue is perfect size for smaller acts, like Trails and Ways, MRCH, etc.  The only complaint about the venue for music acts; it was ice cold! I was freezing the entire time the band was playing. There are some stools/chairs and tables in the music section but not enough for everyone.   The game room/bar section is funky and cool with some games.  I was told that Monday nights would include free games, but this was not true.  There are board games, cards, Jenga, etc. for tables to grab.  There were little bags of snacks at each booth/table, including pretzels, popcorn, etc.   The drinks are interesting and priced similarly to other bars of this nature.    The service was OK but nothing special.

Location: this is near Shea and the 101, near LifePower yoga kind of in a strip of shops/restaurants.   Parking: easy and plentiful.   This looks a lot more fancier on the inside than on the outside!  The decor was appropriate and interesting, but much more classier than other Indian restaurants, though a few framed pics were kind of off.   Service:  Excellent! The server and others were constantly coming by and very helpful and friendly.    Food: Delicious and plentiful!  I had some red curry and ate almost all of it.  My friend had some kind of lamb; when we left, the server offered some rice with her to-go food.

This spa includes massage by Alexis and nails by Leah.   Location: Near Central and McDowell, close to the Hive acupuncture.   The parking can be kind of a pain, as it's a tiny lot, and it's hard to get in and out.   Nails:  I have not had nails done by Leah at this location, but rather at her previous location at the Roose.  Her nail designs are amazing, and she is super friendly. She told me to find specific nail designs to find prior to coming, and I had some cool birds painted on my nails.  I had gel nails done, which looked great for over two weeks.   Leah was friendly and personable during the nail appointment.   Massage: I have now had two massages by Alexis and am going back soon!   Alexis utilizes multiple techniques with the massage and asks lots of questions prior to the massage.  She uses heat, hot stones, cupping, and electronic massagers (not sure what to call?)  The atmosphere is calm, with interesting music and crystals.  Alexis is super friendly, and it is easy to schedule with her - or at least for my schedule!   The prices are comparable to other massages I have had and worth it!   I can't wait to go back!

Delicious healthy food with friendly service and a cheery atmosphere.   I was so excited that Flower Child opened a second location in Phoenix!   Parking:  Near AJs - lots of parking available. This is better than the 44th St location where parking is a pain!   Service: Fantastic! The staff take one's order at the front, then deliver it later. They are friendly and cheery.   Food: Amaze! I love so many things here.  Recently, I ordered the spicy cauliflower, glazed sweet potatoes, and fruit. The fruit was boring. However, the sweet potatoes are delicious with a sneaky spice, and the cauliflower has a crisp caramelized taste.   The teas and lemonades are interesting and fun to mix together.  The cupcakes / desserts taste fairly fresh.  I have also ordered the hummus, which was creamy and well made.   The recent time, the guy I was with had the pho. I personally would never order pho at FC (only at a true Vietnamese place), but he seemed to like it.   Atmosphere:  Fun, light with windows everywhere. There are seats outside, and lots of flowering pots outside.    Cost: The cost is pretty high, but the quality is great.   I went at 11:30 AM on a Saturday, but at around 1pm, we noted the line was out the door.

Great location, good service.   Parking:  Street parking seemed to be nearby.  I walked here from the Starbucks across the street.     Service: Attentive and helpful.   Food:  Rather tasty, though the food I ordered was a bit oily.  I ordered the Lentil Cauliflower Bowl which includes: organic cauliflower, rainbow quinoa, organic black lentils, pickled red grapes, crispy brussels sprouts, honeycup dijon, and aioli.  I could definitely tell the cauli and black lentils were organic!   (j/k)  Atmosphere:  Simple, there is seating indoors and out.   Cost: Moderate.  The dish I ordered was around $13.

Work smarter, not harder, and have fun while doing so!  Since early May, the question most close friends ask me is "what place did you get in class today?"  Though I highly recommend *this* location of Cycle Bar, many of my Chandler friends came to the CycleBar Raintree Ranch after hearing me go on and on and on and on about how amazing CycleBar McCormick Ranch is!  I even convinced a non-cycling friend to come, and he ended up buying a package and getting hooked!   As a former group exercise instructor and someone with a couple advanced degrees in exercise science, I am impressed!  Also, I went during the free class week not expecting to buy a package. I go to spin at other gyms and at One Body One Mind. But, I was hooked! Also, I live ~20-25 minutes away, but I still bought a package and convinced other friends to do the same.   Music:  Usually top notch! Of course, each instructor brings her/his (mostly hers) tastes and style to the class.  The playlists are *sometimes* (not always) available on Spotify post class.   There are theme-based classes in which instructors created specific playlists for a theme. For example themes include:  Mash Up Monday, Throwback Thursday, and holiday themes (for example, fourth of July).    In general, a classic or performance class will have fun, upbeat music.  Some instructors show videos during the class.     Instructors:  Most everyone has been super welcoming and introduces themselves (not all).  Based on classes I have taken, the instructors seem experienced.  I especially enjoy Holly Miller's and Katie M's classes.  Holly is a true coach, motivating and funny throughout. She is not just getting a workout; instead, she is coaching, explaining stats boards, motivating the class, providing very specific instructions on one's RPM and wattage (power), etc.   You cannot  just chill in Holly's classes! Katie M. is similar in a way but has her own coaching style, which I also like.  I haven't been to as many other classes to provide specific feedback at this time.   Class:  The classes are short - 50 minutes. That is usually about 45 mins ride time, plus five minutes cool down.  The instructor usually (not always) explains the stats board.  The stats board is a fun way to see how one is doing during the class.   A person can choose not to have his/her name on the board. I usually do not, as it is distracting to me.  However, the stats are emailed to participants post class.  I love the stats!   The instructor provides instructions on approximate RPM plus the gear.  I usually ride heavy, and I'll have a slightly higher gear than recommended, as it's a preference of mine.  There are also suggestions on power.  There is one 3-4 minute song in which participants pick up the weighted bar on the bike to complete some arms' exercises. I usually do not do this.  I just don't like trying to lift while cycle.  I put my bar away pre-class.  One can view all of these data on the small computers on each bike.  The stats sent after class are a collection of one's performance during class - average RPM, highest RPM, average power / highest power, approximate kcal burned during class, and the most fun - one's rank in class! I like to try to get #1 but at least in the top five if possible.  There is a beginner's class on Saturdays.  That said, I have brought friends who never went to spin before.  One of the guys does not exercise hardly ever. He had a blast and would go back! He did need some additional guidance from me (he was leaning heavy on the handlebars, etc), but did great overall and loved the motivation.   Service: Friendly and not over-bearing, though it would be nice if employees introduce themselves more often. I have gotten to know staff members there, and everyone's nice.   Parking:  This location is in a strip mall area in Seville  / McCormick Ranch. It's near Wildflower, a cup cake place, Sole Sports, etc.  Parking can get crowded later in the day and on weekends, but one can always find a spot.   Amenities:  What are the things we usually forget for the gym? For me, it's not enough hair ties, lip balm, and sometimes a water bottle. Don't you worry, this studio has it all.  There are little jars of these items in the front: hair ties, lip balm, ear plugs, and breath mints.  In the locker room area, there are free plastic water bottles plus chilled filtered water.  The bathroom / showers includes two bathroom stalls, plus three shower stalls.  There are big towels available, and each shower stall has shampoo, conditioner, and shower shell. Some basics are there as well, including Q-tips, tampons, kleenex, razors, spray deodorant, and lotion.   The locker room also has a bowl of bananas for a pre or post workout snack, and little lemon towels to wipe your sweat off!    Gear: The studio also sells items such as tank tops, baseball caps, socks, jackets, capris, etc.

Fun, fast paced intense cycling with beats and instructors to keep you motivated!!    I am now a regular at CycleBar McCormick Ranch, all because of being introduced to these amazing classes through a Yelp event!    This YelpElite Cycle Bar event was slightly different than the McCormick Ranch event.  Similar to last time, Hailey B.  - our Yelp community manager - brought some tasty protein bars one could get after checking in on Yelp.  This particular location did not have the free tank tops and other goodies as the other location did. However, all CycleBars have important and helpful amenities: These include: cycle shoes if you don't have your own, hand towels, fruit, water bottles, water filter/ dispenser, showers, and cold towels post spin, plus lockers for one's goods. I noted this location sells socks (how many times have I forgotten socks in my gym bag!?  A few of my non cycler friends attended this event and had a lot of fun!  Our instructor - Heather- helped people set up bikes and explained the important info. Her playlist was fun and upbeat. A unique and fun thing about CycleBar is that one gets his/ her stats on the board that everyone can view (if one wishes), plus an email later indicating one's place in class, RPM info, and power.  All data can be found under the account as well.  During class, instructors can create fun competitions to encourage individuals to work harder, dependent on the goal set.   Thanks for a fun event!
