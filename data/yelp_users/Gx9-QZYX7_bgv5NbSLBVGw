Most definitely a hole-in-the-wall neighborhood bar. Decor is very much dated, but the bartender, Debbie, is super nice and tends to her customers' every need. Food is ok, but not the best. Owner is rough around the edges, but extremely funny and carries a take shyte from no one attitude, but in a good way. Not my favorite place, but ok if you like dive bars.

I have been coming to this hidden gem for several years now. Ben and Elda (The owners) are the nicest people! I believe they are from the Ukraine.They remember your names, and are always pleasant. I love that the prices are very cheap, and especially since all their meats are Boar's Head! The bagels are delicious, however, you simply cannot mimic bagels from NYC unless you're "in" NYC. But, these bagels are far better than anything else around in Phoenix. Great place to go! HIGHLY recommend.
