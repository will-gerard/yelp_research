The grocery store is cool, pastries looked delicious and the overall vibe of the place was cool. But our burritos were not great. Moved to Phoenix 6 years ago and have yet to find anything close to a Bay Area burrito. What is so hard about having the whole thing heated through?? Still searching.

I love love love their Salmon Chopped Salad and their Vegetarian Soups are fantastic. But I have three critiques:  1) Kids meal should could with fruit and/or vegetable. A grilled cheese sandwich and a cookie is not a balanced meal. The side of fruit at over $3 is RIDICULOUS. There should be a kids fruit side at the very least.  2) I have submitted two requests for non-profit donations and have been denied. I find this upsetting as I am such a regular customer.  3) There should me more to offer kids to to drink...

Wrote some feedback on Yelp and heard from someone "upstairs" VERY QUICKLY. Extremely impressed...

Very very cool. A must-see in Vegas! Come on... add some culture and history to your trip to sin city! Our docent was entertaining and extremely knowledgeable.  We did a daytime tour during the summer and it was really hot. Hope to do o an evening tour next time.

Total find! Delicious Thai in an unassuming Las Vegas strip mall. Extensive wine list. They were able to accommodate my fish/vegetarian needs and everything was wonderful. Will definitely go back for more.

When we called inquire about vegetarian options and whether or not they use lard in their tortillas and beans, the hostess was clueless about food ingredients and I was placed on hold for an inordinate amount of time. After speaking to the manager, we decided to try it out. I placed an order for a less spicy pico de gallo and when it came it burned the roof of my mouth. I asked if something less spicy could be made and was told that everything is pre-made. When the entrees came (we ordered the quinoa salad and fish tacos) I found everything so incredibly spicy that I ended up finishing my kids' quesadilla! Normally love Mexican food but am for sure going to skip this place next time.

I followed Jeanette over from Par Exsalonce. I enjoyed the "spa feel" but was happy to go to Serenity. Jeanette is professional, efficient, and easy to schedule with. I am always very satisfied after a service. I really like supporting an independent business woman and feel good about the the value of service provided. It's also very relaxing!!!

I've been coming to Lisa for 6 years and she's great! Highlights (blonde), cut... I get compliments all the time!!  Lisa's great at creating beautiful color with definition. I find her very pleasant, the salon is easily accessible and I look forward to my appointments.

Came for lunch with kids. No kids menu but if you've got non-picky, relatively well behaved eaters you'll be fine. Great small plates. We really liked the Mac & cheese and Brussel Sprouts. The Rainbow Quinoa Salad was great!

Basically I plan most of my Saturday nights with an end goal of hitting Counter Intuitive. The places oozes hipness and the cocktails are sublime. The pop-up themes are super cool.
