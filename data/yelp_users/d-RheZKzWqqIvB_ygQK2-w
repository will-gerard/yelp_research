DO NOT GO HERE!!!  DISHONEST!!!!!  The food is good the customer service and honesty HORRIBLE!  We ordered a large order for my son's graduation party and was quoted $269. Perfect. We show up an hour before the party to get the food and the price is $429!!!  What?!!  "Sorry ma'am do you want it or not?"  We were told we "must have been misquoted by Maria who took the order."  We had NO choice but to take it since guests were arriving in less than an hour. I called back SEVERAL times to rectify this mistake and was either told someone would call me back (it NEVER happened) or they would hang up on me! Yes hang up. I was told that's what we do when we get busy. We just hang up the phone because we can't answer it. Really?!!  I finally reached Terry, and she wanted to get off the phone quickly but I refused to let her hang up until it was resolved and the end result was "Sorry...we don't do refunds here....you should have known what the price was."  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  MARIA TOLD me what the price was and it almost DOUBLED upon pick up. By the way when Terry decided she had enough of the phone conversation she just hung up. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!!!!!  Unreal!  LEARN CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE!!

I have worked in the field of dentistry for over 16 years.  I can honestly tell you, that there are GREAT orthodontists and there are some that are not so great. That is just the reality of it.  Take the time to educate yourself on who you should see if you need orthodontic care.  Dr. Danyluk has very competetive pricing.  I would encourage you to beware of going to see anybody else just because they offer a lower price.  Remember...in the absence of value, money is always the substitute.    I accepted a position with Dr. D when I relocated to the area.  Let me say this....it is a TOP NOTCH place!  Dr. Danyluk only serves up the very best treatment in orthodontics.    Dr. Danyluk is extremely fun, competent and conscience about every single aspect of his practice.  As a new employee, upon hiring on, it was made very clear to me from day one that there is no compromising.  Every patient deserves the BEST!   The Team Orthodontics staff are highly effective at not only making patients comfortable but they pride themselves on making it an AMAZING EXPERIENCE.   The time that is put into training the staff and assistants is obvious.  Dr. Danyluk does not cut corners.  Never has and never will.  Whether that be the products that he uses or the caliber of individuals that he chooses.  Everything is very deliberate and well thought out.  I can say that as a newcomer to the area of Phoenix, when people find out that I am working with Dr. D they all say the same thing...."What a fun and GREAT place to work!"  And it is.  Dr. Danyluk runs a fantastic operation.  It is a "must do" experience if you or someone you know needs orthodontic care.    Michelle N.

Mmmmm love Nello's!  Great lunch combo of a personal size pizza, salad and drink for $9.99. At dinner it gets very noisy so it's the perfect place to take your mother-in-law

I made an appointment for an oil change/service package that I purchased on Groupon. I showed up. No appointment scheduled. The rude guy at the front desk said, "well we can see you but it will take about an hour and a half since you don't have an appointment."  (Remember.... I DID have an appointment). My response?  "Ok no problem". Him:  That service comes with the replacement of your air filter. Me:  ok awesome. After over an hour of waiting he comes to me and says "we don't have your air filter in stock....we are getting it from another location so it will be at least another hour." Me: uhhhhh ok?  .....then after waiting another hour I overhear the guy from the garage come in and say "we don't have her air filter....we would have to order it from the dealer if she wants that done."  (At this point I'm thinking he is gonna call me up to discuss this with me.) Nope. Now my car is parked at the curb as if it's done. But I know it isn't because we haven't had the conversation about the air filter.  I wait another 40 minutes. I've been here WAY LONGER than expected. I go up. He ignores me. I ask if my car is done. He looks at me with his eyes but doesn't move his head position from the computer. He said "ya it's ready....it's been ready."  WTH?!  So I said, "did you get the air filter done?"  He said, "ohhh....so funny story about the air filter....we can't get it."  I am waiting thinking he will offer me a time to come back when he CAN get it. Nope. Silence. I looked at him and asked what I paid for then. He said I paid for an oil change. I explained I bought it because it can't with a "service package". He said "uhhhh ya....well if you want you can bring it by sometime to see if we have the filter in yet."  IS THIS GUY AN IDIOT?!  I Would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. Oh and just for the record, THEY ARE GOING TO ORDER AND REPLACE MY AIR FILTER!  They just don't know it yet. I'm calling the manager. Let's hope he isn't the manager!  Absurdly incompetent!

My husband some how got a hole in the side wall of his tire. We always use Discount because they stand behind their work. A $400 tire cost me $109 due to a partial warranty honored. Thank you, Brandon. You were very professional and courteous.

DIGNITY HEALTH CARE HOSPITAL.  Do they know the definition of dignity?  This hospital is a JOKE!  I took my daughter to the ER with what we thought was gallbladder a issue. After they got the info they needed and ordered some testing, they put us in an "active treatment waiting area" (see pic). This is exactly the same waiting room all the other people come into who haven't been seen yet.  There were people with IV's, people sound asleep and snoring, others talking people's ears off who couldn't care less, and people like my daughter who are in extreme pain and want to be left alone and not in view of all gawkers!  There was a man vomiting violently into a garbage can while he sat and waited for hours next to us. Stomach bug probably. Great...let's expose as many people as possible!!  The nurse went over everyone's personal information in front of others!  What happened to HIPPA?!  Once my daughter's results were in they called us to another area in the back as asked us to wait for the doc there.  Another type of public waiting area. The doc came in and sat down and started to discuss results (with everyone watching and listening) and then said, "hmmm....maybe we can find some place more private.  Follow me". We did. She led us to a room no bigger than a coat closet with no chairs!  She asked us to stand while we all stood shoulder to shoulder and she discussed the results. The results showed a diseased gallbladder that would require another test to see if removal was necessary. We were informed they don't do that there. Why not?  You're an ER?!!  My daughter was sent home with pain medication and told to get in to see her primary care doc in 3-5 days!!!  Well that night which was last night things went from bad to worse. This morning our primary care doc was FURIOUS that she had been sent home without surgery.  I am writing this review as I am at another hospital waiting for them to take her to surgery now for emergency removal of the gallbladder. I think it would benefit the people who run that hospital to remind themselves of the definition of Dignity:  the state or quality of being worthy of honor or respect. (This place clearly does NOT give their patients privacy nor dignity!).   Signed One Very Unhappy Mom!

Aji is amazing. I have done their massages and the facial once. Wow!  So relaxing. If you have any service done you get to use the amenities for the day such as the pool (with a poolside waitress for drinks and food) and the hot tub. I highly recommend Aji. The locker room is beautiful and filled with everything you need after a day at the spa to shower and freshen up.

I wrote to customer service because I am in utter shock that their membership fees that are normally $55 skyrocketed to $100!  Here is their response:  (my original email is at the very bottom and their canned response is below). I guess the simply don't care. And by the way...I didn't even renew so there is NO refund needed Sams Club!  You're missing the entire point.   Subject Membership Fee to High  Response By Email (Marianela) (03/02/2016 02:16 AM) Michelle,   Thank you for contacting Sam's Club in regards to cancelling your membership. You may visit the Member's Service Desk at your local Sam's Club to cancel your membership to receive an immediate refund. Requesting to have your membership cancelled over the phone or through the mail is also an option. However, keep in mind it can take 6-8 weeks to receive.  Regards,  Marianela  Sam's Club Member Service Center 2101 SE Simple Savings Drive Bentonville, AR 72716-0745   MY ORIGINAL EMAIL TO CUSTOMER SERVICE BELOW:  I am very unhappy with Sam's Club right now. We have been members for YEARS! Many years! It appears that Sam's now charges $100 to renew a membership. No wonder for the HIGH PRESSURE at checkout that you make the clerks push for! If you renew on a prorated cost it doesn't seem so high. I don't care that I get cash back! It seriously disturbs me that you would do this It seems sly and shady. Sam's club is losing my business. I will be going to Costco now. Please consider THE REASON people choose Sam's Club is because we, as consumers, know that this is essentially Walmart. We are looking for Walmart prices! If we wanted Costco prices we would go to Costco. Bye Bye Sam's club. I refuse to pay this inflated membership fee! OH and by the way! You're Twitter handle is WRONG! There is no way to reach you by Twitter! My assumption is your bad publicity was out of hand and so you removed your Twitter account.

I really like Cold Stone Creamery's.  However, the one at Casa Paloma really needs to take measures to handle the huge influx of customers nightly.  I cannot think of one night that I have ever been in that the door isn't being held open by a customer's foot and the line is out the door to the curb.  Yes, that IS a good thing, however, with only 2 employees working, it just moves entirely too slow.  Rest assured that if you are 5-6 people back in line the wait is at least 20 minutes.  If you are at the curb it will be at least an hour!  There are two stations for prepping ice cream there and I have never once seen the other station open so that these people can work faster with more employees.  I was there three weeks ago and everyone was so bothered that they all began to leave.  Myself included.  As people were walking to their cars, the conversations overheard were all the same, "this place is entirely too busy for them to always only have two employees!"  I think the owner really needs to know about this.  As a business owner, I'm sure the question is always, "would it be cost beneficial to add another employee or two?"  The answer is yes!  In this case, yes!  You are essentially turning people away.  I watched over 15 people leave one night.  At $6 average each ice cream that is approx. $90 that walked away in 3 minutes.  And keep in mind that was only what I witnessed.  This happens several times a night.  We drive by and check the line before we ever get out of the car.  Let's just say that Baskin Robbins in Ahwatukee gets a LOT of business because of this.  -Hopeful for faster service soon

Nurse practitioners are exceptional!  Docs are terrible!  We have to fight tooth and nail every time my husband or myself needs refills for cholesterol, blood pressure or migraine Meds!  RIDICULOUS!  Once again here I am at the pharmacy with NO med refills. Even the pharmacist is shocked at their lack of competence!  He sees this every time he deals with this doc!  Unacceptable!

Ashley is amazing!  She has been doing my hair for over a year now. It was being over processed and it was VERY dry and brittle!  Ashley had nursed it back to health. I get a lot of compliments on it!  Thanks Ashley!  YOU ROCK!

As my daughter sat at the yogurt shop next to the Dunkin Donuts on a Friday night at 8am we watched at least a dozen cars pull up, pull on the LOCKED door and give their business to the yogurt shop, Zoyo. Who closes at 8pm on a Friday night?  Had they been open they would have had plenty of business to warrant the cost of keeping it open!  Where's the manager?  Does he or she not see this and make adjustments?  It seems crazy to me. The Zoyo manager thanks you for your stupidness!   When I did get donuts here before the donuts were stale and I literally took them back and was told "oh ya don't ever buy donuts after 2pm. That's when we make our last batch and they are gonna be stale if you but them right before closing."  SERIOUSLY?

I stopped by just now to purchase what I thought would be a beautiful cupcake or a slice of cake to take to my friend at work on her birthday. The presentation in the refrigerated unit at the bakery counter was just disgusting! Not only was it ugly and looks like everything had been touched and moved 100 times, there's whipped cream smeared all over the inside of the refrigerated unit that appears to of been there for at least a month because it has turned that crusty yellow color!  I am not buying here and even though I've never tried their food, I don't intend to. Cleanliness and presentation is so important to me.

I received a 55 min massage gift certificate for Mother's Day. When I arrived I asked the MT to concentrate on my back and feet only. She did a so so job on my back and then moved into my feet where she spent a total of MAYBE 5 mins and announced my session was over. In the massage room I could hear laughter and loud voices coming from a back room from the employees. The music didn't even drown it out. Unprofessional. I won't be back.

Such a brilliant idea to offer DIY dog washing station!  My dog has a terrible fear of water and separation anxiety. This is the perfect solution. I can be the one to wash him taking extra time and care without causing him unnecessary stress. Loved it!  Brian the owner was awesome!  Took the time to tell me about the business, the other location and veteran discounts that include FREE DIY station for vets!  That's awesome!

I was always curios how this business survived when all of the customers are across the street at Rudy's. I bought a Groupon to try it out. For what I got in food, (reg $50+ for $20 with Groupon) we could have got SO MUCH MORE at Rudy's. The beans don't hold a candle to Rudy's and they don't give you any bread!  They are super picky about not giving you any amount over the 2 lbs of meat since the guy took the meat and trimmed off a piece the size of about 4 postage stamps. Rudy's would have not done that!  The meat was good, but not near as good as Rudy's. The mashed potatoes and gravy have a flavor that don't even go with the BBQ. I would encourage them to drop prices, include bread and improve the food of they truly want to compete.

I experienced a Tide Dry Cleaners today for the first time ever!  I pulled up and Shelli came out to great me under the pull-through. We went inside so I could give her my information. When I walked in the amazing smell of clean laundry greeted me!  I LOVE the smell of laundry. I DO NOT love the smell of dry cleaning fluid. Shelli explained how regular dry cleaning fluid causes cancer and is even banned in CA!  I had no idea. The other thing I loved was it was VERY clean and organized. The racks that hold the clothing after cleaning are all numbered. This numbering system allows you to pull up to a kiosk that is outside, if you should show up after hours!  You simply put in the number on your receipt and your pin # (Shelli will give you yours) and you can pick up anytime!  No more rushing to make it to the dry cleaners before they close!  That kiosk also allows drop offs too!  Wow. How convenient. I love this place!

I brought my car here when it died and I pretty much coasted into their parking lot. It was in need of an alternator. They helped me jump start it and get it to the garage and took care of it quickly.  My husband felt it was pricey ($900) but it was done and ready by the following day. I would definitely recommend them!  Very professional and understanding.

Mmmmm Zipp's is where my son and I have lunch together every Friday. We always order the same thing. Chicken tenders!  They are amazing!!!  I have to say that this last Friday we were both disappointed and still hungry with the small serving size!  I hope they aren't planning on dropping their portion sizes because that will not make me happy...

Love Bosa!  Excellent donuts that are always fresh. My only complaint would be sometimes I go in at night to be prepared with donuts for the morning and there is nothing left. . Also the Boba smoothies are amazing!  Taro is my fav!

Horrible service. The manager is rude and completely unhelpful. I have a return of shampoo and she refuses to help. Had a hairspray bottle that quit working about halfway through the bottle (aerosol) and she said "sorry!  You've used too much...we can't help you."  Since I paid $22 for the hairspray that is not acceptable!!  They Never offer the free gifts. I always have to ask! The store is a WRECK!  Makeup is smeared everywhere!  The floor, the displays, etc!  and nothing is in stock!

Alice is the manager at Petsmart!  She is AWESOME!  Petco was advertising a pet gate online for $49 but when we got to the store the price was $90!  With no success speaking to the manager to honor the price, we drove down the street and not only did Alice price match, but she honored Petco's coupon!  Petco literally shot themselves in the foot. The dug their heels in and let their own website beat them and it sent their faithful consumer to the competition. We will be loyal to Petsmart from here on out. THANK YOU ALICE!  YOU ARE AMAZING!!!!

The yogurt is good although they NEVER change it up. It has been the same flavors since they opened.   I decided today I am not going in again. The girl at the register is absolutely rude. She snapped "don't enter your phone number before you put your yogurt on the scale!!!"  . She is unfriendly and completely unhelpful. She doesn't greet people or say goodbye.   She also puts out 4 sample cups at a time. That doesn't matter to me since they never change flavors I know what they taste like but I heard a new customer as for more cups and she said "how many did you use already?!"  Seriously what does it matter? They only hold a spoonful at a time!   Rude. Unacceptable and the owner seriously needs to get rid of her. I won't be in again until she is gone.  And all she does is sit on her phone and text. But she hides to do it so the owner won't see her!
