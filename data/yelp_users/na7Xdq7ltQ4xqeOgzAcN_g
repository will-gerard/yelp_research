I over heard a coworker talking about this place and gave it a shot with my BF today! It's was all around great. The service was fast with no fluff and the food was great. Homemade clam chowder and pizza with a drink for under 6 bucks. Their pizza was better than ray's and their pizza-cookie dessert was divine. I'll be back and telling all my friends.

It looks and tastes like nothing special... Kinda bleh. But the waitress was dare I say... overly friendly. It was almost uncomfortable how awkward it was lol.  I'd prefer the Good Egg anyday

I've been using this company for years and am never disappointed. They make recommendations, offer product pictures and pricing on their website and even cut me deals from time to time. They are amazingly clean jumpys. Cleaner than any other company. ILL NEVER GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!

I've used them so many times (and I thought I'd written a review in the past) but they are so awesome! If you go to the website (www.funnjump.com) and know what you want the whole transaction will be flawless. I'll never use another company!! The always have specials, cut deals for frequent customers, and are EXTREMELY CLEAN!

Love everything I've tried on the menu and they make a mean scotch on the rocks. I've had the pizza, mussels, and a few of the salads. All GREAT!

I have a hard time giving 5 stars but their orange chicken is probably what a miracle taste like. OMG. They run out it's so good. I always call ahead now to make sure they have it. I guess it's because there's a long marinating process.

I don't like giving five-star reviews unless they're absolutely deserved... And Kona 13 really deserves it! They are absolutely spot on with their coffee which is great but their customer service is what puts them over the top. The young men and women that work there in the morning are always wonderful to me on my way to work. They hold great conversation, they make my coffee right and they always asked to make sure it taste right before I drive away. it's just really wonderful and refreshing to see people who truly care about their craft

I was impressed with the service and in love with the grilled cheese but when the owner took time to come check on me and friends- I was wowed. She remembered my name and treated me like the only customer in the place... Something you just don't get at chain restaurants.
