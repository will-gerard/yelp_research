Make sure you specify that you want the garlic mozzarella bread with your entree ($7.99) not an appetizer($9.99) even though its not listed on the menu as an appetizer. According to the manager they got new menus in January...I wonder how much extra money they made from this mistake for almost 2 months? Oh and we were the first people to notice! Ha Food was good service horrible. Now I remember why I don't come here.
