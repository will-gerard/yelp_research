I brought a large gold necklace here to sell for the gold only (ugliest necklace in the world...even Mr. T would throw up if he saw it) and they offered $700 and a lot of explanations as to why a solid gold necklace was worth that. Went elsewhere and sold it for $1,850.  London Goooold...it's the pest!

I was born in the Bronx and have eaten at all the great NYC deli's. Not the touristy ones...the real deli's. When I came out to Arizona, people suggested Chompie's and a couple other places (one person suggested Einstein's Bagels for "real New York deli food" so I stabbed them). And by accident, I found Goldman's.  Outside NYC, people think I'm strange for ordering a turkey with chopped liver, red onion and mustard on rye with a pickle and square knish. The lady at Goldman's has never laughed...to my face. The counter case is filled with all sorts of top notch deli. There are no bad choices and it is always perfect.  So, if you're a New Yorker trapped west of Eight Ave. and you want REAL deli, stab someone for suggesting the Jack in the Box Pastrami Melt is just as good as them N.Y. deli's and head to Goldman's.  Tell 'em "Stabby Finkelstein sent you."

YC's? Because!  When I first moved to the Phoenix area, I discovered the most beautiful Mexican-American woman in the world...working at YC's Mongolian Stir Fry. In fact, having sampled several locations in the valley, the owner seems to be fond of hiring the most beautiful Mexican-American women. I don't really care but it is distracting when I eat there twice a day.  If you've never tried Mongolian Stir Fry, basically you put raw ingredients into a bowl, add sauces and it is cooked on a big, hot surface. After a couple of minutes, BING! Lunch and dinner and another lunch, if you know how to "play" the system at YC's.  There are no "going back for seconds," so plan accordingly. You get your bowl and pay $10 (children are charged by age or just get them a small bowl).  Your first step is loading in the meat. Huh-huh! The meats are sliced and frozen. Place a good amount in the bowl and press it down with the papers at the end of the bar. I like to then go to the fry station and load some peanuts in the bowl and put on some hot chili oil. Then I load on assorted vegetables, tofu and noodles. Then I add the sauces. Some locations have "sauce experts" who take a brutal ribbing for having that on the back of their shirts. Imagine a beautiful Mexican-American woman with that on her shirt. It gives you ideas. Impure ideas.  Honestly, the line method is meat, veggies, sauce, then step up to the fry station, add sesame seeds, peanuts, pineapple and/or assorted oils and such and the chef will cook it for you. I do it by jumping around (when there's no line of people behind me) so the sauce sits on the meat (huh-huh!) and isn't all sitting on the noodles. Don't worry about overloading the bowl a mile high of your food choices. It cooks down and the idea is taking stuff home. They actually encourage it (take out boxes are 50Â¢, so it's a profit scam...deal).  Add a bowl of all-you-can-eat-and-stuff-into-the-baggies-in-your-pocket rice (white or brown) and soups (always two kinds) and you are in heaven...with beautiful Mexican-American sauce experts! Huh-huh!  Please don't forget to tip the cook a dollar per bowl and leave a couple of bucks for the girls who have to clean up the table...scrubbing and bending. Cleaning up after such a dirty, dirty boy. Mmmmmm-ah!

Despite the other reviews, I've been to this location twice, both time emergencies and they were extremely quick and efficient and either didn't charge me, or just asked for a few dollars for "breakfast."  Perhaps management changed, perhaps the other reviewers just aren't happy having to pay for their cars. I was extremely happy and grateful.

While the white man still struggles with getting the native population to die so Uncle Sam can take over the casinos and cigarette sales, the tribes smile and continue to wave their tribal lawyers at the government but there is a secret plot to kill the white man and it's plain delicious!  Yes, if you don't notice from the size of the workers and other tribe members who eat there or sell jewelry out front, fry bread is not a diet item. Seldom is the mana from heaven good for you but why question the powers that be?  Start with the chili (red's my favorite) and fry bread and finish off with the butter and chocolate fry bread. A quick trip to the emergency ward for some artery cleaning and you are ready to go back for more.  Seriously, one of the better fry bread places and it's clean, inexpensive and the staff is friendly. You will need to wash your hands after your meal or your car keys will slide from your hands and forget trying to steer. With such a small parking lot, one does not want to navigate out of a spot with greasy hands.  *I had to laugh at the Yelp form when it asked about "reservations." ;)

Taco Jalisco Is SO Authentic, It Should Be Deported!  My friend Mike always told me I should check out Taco Jalisco on Thomas, just west of Scottsdale Road (you have to be traveling west to get into the parking lot). I trust Mike's tastes, but not in women, so with an afternoon errand we had to run, we stopped at TJ for lunch/brunch.  The outside is unassuming and probably hiding for "La Migra" so don't blink or you'll miss it. It's right next door to the "Smoke Shop."  As Mike says, "it's like you've crossed the border without a passport." You step into a place that was airlifted from any town in Mexico and the number of Mexicans eating there tell you it is authentic, frightening to timid white people and due to be raided at any moment.  The menus is laid out right in front of you. Have a second choice as they cook only the freshest household pets and not everything might be available that day.  My first choice of the fried steak torta was not available or they were just playing with me, so I got the taco, torta cobination. Mike chose the breakfast eggs with something and it looked really good. I'm guessing the Chorizo is the best in the city. When I have a day to spend close to a bathroom, I'll give it a try.  You won't walk away anything but full. With sides of rice, refried beans and vegetable garnishes, bring an appetite.  Aside from leaving full but not bloated, it tasted fresh and I had that, "I ate something healthy" feeling. I'll certainly be returning soon. Don't forget the salsa, chili and limes that sit in a side bar but you might want to ask how spicy some are because this is Mexican food that isn't dumbed down for Americans.

I wish there was a half star more I could give Tottie because it is really my favorite place for Chinese or Thai (haven't tried the sushi) but there have been one or two slip ups on the part of the staff. Aside from that, Tottie, I love you long time!  Good, dark and elegant place for a date, or affair, Tottie, and you could make a great meal from just the appetizers. Order a Pu Pu. Huh-huh!   The Tottie Rolls, with sauce and lettuce wrap are great and if you're lucky and it's late, Tottie will prepare them for you and feed them to you while her womanly chest heaves with desire, using food as one would join in human sexual desire. But I digress.  All the dishes are terrific but I wish the Pad Thai was not as mushy. If you do have any complaints, Tottie is always the lady and restaurateur and will treat your complaint with patience and kindness or perhaps a spanking and some rough stuff before she forces your head into the plate of Pad Thai by lying prone on your back, squirting that Scrimshaw sauce, or whatever they call it, into your nasal cavity and belittling you in Chinese because you've been a naughty, naughty boy. But I digress  For dessert, I highly recommend the coconut ice cream with fried honey bananas. Your banana will be surprisingly hot and Tottie likes it that way. That's how she serves the bananas in her place.  I didn't care for the incredible wait at the Paradise Valley location, but hopefully Tottie will have more openings for us all. But I digress.

I spent half my life at Coney Island and wanted a NY hot dog. It wasn't here. Try Nathan's at the AZ Mills Mall...and even that ain't a Coney Island dog.  I seem to remember the very sweet and helpful waitress saying Jim wasn't from Coney Island, so I gave her a good tip before shootin' her.  Don't be fooled by the name. Looked like it was out of business last time I drove by. Maybe somethin' happened to Jim. You know what I'm talkin' about!?

After my final walk out of Quick Wok on Southern because it stinks, I decided to try TOTT. It was a really happy ending! Not the kind where you get sexual satisfaction, although eating good Asian food can be orgasmic, which is why they won't let me eat at the restaurant anymore, but the taste and morning after effects are always the key.  Good, healthy portions make it half the cost because it becomes two meals. Great place for a date or just sitting alone, moaning in pleasure, which is why they won't let me eat inside anymore.  Many delicious dishes and the gigunda pork egg rolls are huge and give me pleasure like no woman can, which is why no woman will let me eat in the restaurant anymore.  Plenty of parking and a coffee place next door, which oddly enough also won't let me stay inside anymore. I just sit in my car, facing towards the restaurant and eat my take out meal, moaning in delight and starring at female diners, while my van is a rockin'. Yes, I see you putting that egg roll into your mouth, lady. Oooooooh YES!  TMI? I can never tell.

As much as the interior set up of the place resembles the community tables one might find in prison, or so I'm told, the food is fantastic and the shower rape almost never happens, at least during lunch hours.  Depending on the crowd, or lack thereof, you might have to fill out a little form with codes for the different dishes. Sure, it sounds like passing messages in a North Vietnamese prison camp, or so I'm told, but the staff will always patiently help you to choose whatever you want, before you are tortured for information on troop movements.  The combos are the real treat and the Jade Red Chicken as a quesadilla and the roast pork as a burrito are the best! Yes, it's Chinese food wrapped in quesadillas or burritos and the Snickerdoodle cookie you get with your meal caps it all off better than a dock strike clearing out the scab workers and importing more prostitutes, or so I'm told.  I can never eat a whole combo, or so I'm told, so having a second meal makes this a real bargain as well as delicious.

I give them all my money and I never regret a moment of it. Don't see what you desire? Ask Jason and he'll find it for you!  Get on the mailing list and attend one of the special events. Fun and fab!

While everything on the menu is fantastic, I go for the Gyro (Yee-roo). It is, and I have explored Gyros across Phoenix, the BEST!  The place is clean and the music depends on the combination of who is working there that day. If George and Z, his friend, co-owner and cook, are on, you get an easy mix of classic rock and contemporary pop. If Geroge's father is working with George, you will get Greek music (which I love...stay long enough for the theme to "Zorba the Greek"). If George's father and Z are there, you get a mix of everything.  With the police station across the street, lunchtime is crowded but safe. Off hours is easy and the wait isn't long.  Friendly and very reasonably priced with specials posted that one should not ignore. I hear great things about the chili. One day I will order a Chili Gyro. They may look at me for a moment, but they will make one and probably add it to the menu.  Friendly and great service. Become a regular and you're part of the family. Opa!  4/20/11 - Sigh! I stopped at George's on my way out of town, moving back east. My "last meal," so to speak and I have yet to find the equal anywhere. So, dear diners, enjoy the fine fare at George's because you may have no idea how rare the place really is.  At this point I'm ready to ask him to FedEx me a dozen Gyros... not that I would freeze any of them. I would just sit on the floor and roll around on them, naked. Well, maybe not... but I would eat them all in one sitting!

Many may think eating at a restaurant that sets up in a parking lot after the car shop closes might be dicey as far as the health code goes but as we all know, the city health inspectors are crooks and hired usually through nepotism and political graft (how else would Denny's remain open?), so I say forge ahead and experience Nogales Hot Dogs!  My friend, Mike, had spoken often about me trying a heavenly wiener, and as he's heterosexual, I assumed it was a food product. To my delight and relief, it was.  Mike and I arrived just as they set up and with a little bit of everything on the bacon-wrapped dogs and glass bottles of Coca-Cola, I was scarfing down the delicious mystery meat and considering having another, even though it would be too much to digest and I'd be throwing up from the acid reflux.  I can't recommend this place highly enough. Get there early because it fills up fast. As for the next morning, depending on how much hot stuff you put on your dog, you might not want to make any early appointments.

The best Thai I have had has been in Kansas City, but I stumbled into Papaya Thai one day and was blown away by their Pad Thai!  Pad Thai is, as seemingly simple as it is, a hard dish to get right. Not too firm and not to mushy...just like my women! ;) A good PT should roll onto your fork like spaghetti with very heavy sauce and not come up in clumps. I use chopsticks but it's the same principle.  The Thai Spring Rolls were not the best I've ever had, so I have to take away a star for that and slap the chef.  *Just received a message from another reviewer asking, or rather demanding, that I lower my rating as he only gave it one star in 2012. I suppose that the cook I had may have left or it changed owners. As this review was written in 2010, it is very possible that there was changes for the worst. Caviet emptor, I suppose.

Can I give them no stars? I had been told by a car dealer service center I needed $2,200 worth of work (just as the cash for clunkers program started) and it was too much and sounded odd. A neighbor suggested this location and they made me a great deal! Well, great for them it seems.  A year later, while getting my oil changed, the owner's son alerted dad that I needed over $1,000 worth of work on things they had supposedly done a year before. The key was the look on the face of the counter guy, who I assume had scruples and was ashamed at the attempt to defraud me.  A friend hooked me up with a mechanic he had used for years and, long story short, not only was there nothing wrong with everything they told me needed to be replaced, but they never replaced the parts they charged me for a year before and the 40K tires I bought didn't last 10K miles.  Sorry Big O guys, but you stepped into this one. The moment you charged me for work that wasn't done, you became untrustworthy. Guess the owner needed more income that week. Hope this closes you down! You have it coming.

I can't believe a Japanese person could eat an entire bowl of this ramen but the waitperson insisted it is authentic. I have to give it to them -- it's the best ramen I've ever had!  When you walk in, there's a certain way of ordering. You pick a base soup and then add ingredients. If you are having any trouble figuring it out, the helpful staff, with names like Shiloh and Moonbeam will be glad to help you out.  The huge bowls are reasonably priced and extremely filling, so if you order a side dish, you can forget about finishing. Probably better to go in knowing you'll come out with half of it left over for dinner.
