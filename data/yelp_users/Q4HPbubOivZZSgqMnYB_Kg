1 hour and 48 minutes for delivery when quoted 40 minutes. No offer of a discount. When a discount was requested due to the inconvenience I was laughed at by the manager. RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL, UNPROFESSIONAL, and I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy. Horrible management and service

What a great experience! Before I brought my Siberian Husky there I stopped in, since it's right by my house and inquired about pricing, details, etc. They are very reasonably priced and all three staff members were extremely helpful.  I scheduled an appointment for a few days later and dropped off my very dirty, shedding, and frankly mangy Husky. A few hours later I picked up a brand new dog. I have had previous groomers quit mid-groom and call me to pick him up. I have had others finish washing him and call me to pick him up wet. Not at Aunt Donna's. I know he's a pain in the butt at groomers and they didn't complain at all. They were happy to have him. They had a great attitude and most importantly he looked great.   Highly recommended

I have used A Better Tint on 3 of my vehicles and was so impressed with the quality of work, I had them tint the windows on my home. All 4 experiences were pleasant and when comparing prices I found them to be one of the more affordable companies in the valley. I would highly recommend them.

I was so displeased on Valentine's Day with both my food and service. I have lived in the valley for years and always wanted to dine at Elements. Normally on special occasions or when we are in the mood to treat ourselves we have our usual spots; Mastros, Flemings, Donovans... If you couldn't tell we enjoy a nice steak, but this year we decided to mix it up and give Elements a shot and were very excited to finally check this place out.   The view did not disappoint. Megan, one of the managers was very pleasant when accommodating our reservation. Another one of the managers was also very pleasant who sat us, but I do not recall his name... Unfortunately, that is where the pleasantries stopped.  Our server came across rude and uninterested. This could have been because of the prix fixe menu or maybe he was just having an off night but our drinks were always left empty, we rarely saw him, he came across very snarky and even sarcastic at times.   I was also unimpressed with the food/menu for the evening. Out of our table of 4 the only thing anyone enjoyed was the bacon wrapped shrimp. The majority of us ordered the short ribs and not one person was impressed. The salads were ok, the desserts lacked flavor, and the presentation could have been better.  For a dinner totaling $600 for 4 people who barely drank ( I think 3  beers and 3 cocktails for the whole table) I left feeling like I had almost been taken advantage of. I feel like Elements rested on their reputation and truly did not make the extra effort in service or cuisine that has awarded them their stellar reputation. As a business owner I understand you can't be perfect 100% of the time but this was a definite disappointment and I felt my experience warranted the lowest possible rating. Hopefully, one day we can give them another shot on a non holiday, non prix fixe menu and I can change my opinion but as of now they or 0 for 1.

I am a big fan of this place. I love their consistency. It's nice that the owners recognize you, shake your hand, and thank you for coming in. Weekend mornings look like there will be a long wait but they are very efficient, even with 30 people outside it normally doesn't take more than 10-15 minutes to be sat. The food comes out quickly as well so it's always a pleasant experience.  I recommend the 1/2 and 1/2 with a scramble and protein pancakes. Hits the spot every time and plenty of food to leave full.

What a great place with an amazing staff. We have been ordering here for years. I have ordered as small as a side of meatballs (which are delicious) all the way to major family events catered. The food is always amazing, the service is always professional, and I am always pleased. Check out their menu. You might be surprised how much of a variety their menu offers. Highly recommended

I was so excited to try this place after seeing it featured on Check Please, unfortunately I could not have been more disappointed. The service started off very accommodating but quickly fell short. I'm not sure if our server was given too many tables or what his issue was but we saw him once the last hour and fifteen minutes of our evening. The appetizers were good but the macaroni and cheese lacked flavor and was very dry, the seafood crepes looked amazing in photos but fell short. We all ordered Moscow Mules and nobody enjoyed those either. Even after everything falling short I was still so excited for the red velvet cake because of the photo of it on Yelp. Even the cake was dry and the frosting really didn't have that soft texture with cream cheese flavor. I won't be going back.  Oh I almost forget... I also ordered a side of the corn bread pudding and never received it, but since the server never came back to check on us after dropping the food we never got a chance to request it again. Fail

I have nothing but glowing things to say about Charleston's in general, but specifically the Ray location. We have dined here at least 30 times and it's always consistent, always good food, and great service.   We have our go to entrees, we always start with shrimp cargot and a basket of croissants (soooo good) and then we get the ribs! The ribs are fall off the bone every time. I would truly say the best ribs I've ever had. Finish that off with the bread pudding and you can die happy. Thank me later

Horrible service and down right dishonest staff!!!  I am going to attempt to simplify this review to make it as brief as possible. I took my family of 5 (all adults) there before the Eric Clapton concert on Thursday night. Our waitress was horrible. She took extremely long for every drink order, small requests such as silverware, plates, water, etc. you get the point.  We were drinking fairly quickly and between 5 of us there was always a new request when she visited our table so I understand we weren't an easy table, but that's no excuse for the horrible service.   Fast forward to the bill being dropped off. $176 and she casually mentions as she is walking off she included automatic gratuity of 18%. Last time I checked automatic grat is for parties of 6 or more and it was also posted on their menus. I explained to our waitress she was not as efficient as I would have liked and I would like her to remove the automatic $30 tip she decided to give herself. Now this may not translate well but when she brought the new bill back she handed it to me without even stopping. She continued her stride and no stop to apologize or say thanks for coming in. It was extremely rude. I then look down at the bill and notice a $26 service charge. What the heck is a service charge at a restaurant? I asked another waitress and she had no clue, so this was my cue to ask for a manager.   20 minutes later a manager shows... no joke! And keep in mind we are trying to catch a concert. He gives me some excuse about how the regular waitress got in a car wreck and didn't show up to work so we were the lucky table that were awarded her incompetent replacement. He mentions he took 20% off my bill and I appreciated the attempt... until I notice he only discounted the happy hour priced appetizers. On a $176 bill we only had a few small apps. The 20% discount was 5 bucks. Long story short, this place is a joke! I don't recommend them at all.

We have used Snapbooth for 4 different corporate events. It's always a great touch that our staff really enjoys. Their team is always very easy to work with and we have never had an issue. A company that actually does what they say is always refreshing.

Unpleasant. I could write an essay on my disappointments here but I will just choose the one that put me over the edge. They charge $5 PER SLICE if you bring in your own cake to celebrate an occasion.   That's right folks! If you go to their restaurant to celebrate any occasion that requires you to bring in a cake, they will gladly take your cake in the back, slice it up, and serve it to all your guests for $5 per slice. I don't like getting nickel and dimed at a brunch that costs me $350 for 6 people in the first place.    I am far from cheap. I didn't bring a cake in to save from spending money at your restaurant. I brought it because that particular cake is a tradition for my mother's birthday and I will not pay you $30 for my 5 other guests and I to enjoy my already purchased cake.   On my final note, I was advised by the server if I cut the cake and served it myself, I would still be charged the fee!!!   Classless... Absolutely classless

Before getting into this particular experience at the Grind, I will say I have been there two other times and enjoyed it, but this time was much different. I went specifically for the scallop potatoes, but I guess they are no longer on the menu (even though they are online) so it got off to a rocky start.   We were "greeted" by the server slamming down 2 ice waters in front of us without him saying a word. A hello or how are you would have sufficed. I ordered the Kobe Beef Burger and my GF ordered the grilled chicken wrap. Roughly 25/30 mins later they delivered our food. My GF's wrap was swarming in onions, yet the description on the menu made no reference to onions, so we politely asked for this to be rectified due to her distaste for onions. We were notified that the kitchen could pick them out? Really pick them out when your menu clearly never lists the use of onions. Wow. So she sends it back and snacks on the mac and cheese that we did enjoy.   Like I mentioned earlier I ordered the Kobe Beef burger. I asked for it medium rare and at $17 I expected it to be cooked that way... But I guess that's too much to ask. After sending her wrap back I really didnt want to be "that guy" so I ate it but when he asked me how everything was a blind man could see my disappointment. At this point my drink has been empty for 4 or 5 mins and conveniently placed at the end of the table for the eye to see... Apparently not his eyes though.   A few minutes later they returned with her wrap. To say the least is was very dry and the flavorless, but maybe that's the price you pay when altering the dish so it is what it is. But then I looked at her plate and saw the puddle of grease draining from her wrap. Its a grilled chicken wrap, where did grease come from? She ate a half of the half and placed it at the end of the table. The server then picked it up and asked if she wanted it wrapped up to go. When 3/4 of her dish is uneaten and we don't want it wrapped up, this is your cue to ask if did not fit her standards, but clearly that didn't happen.   Long story short... The server was very aware we did not enjoy our food, service, and overall experience. No offer of a complimentary dessert (actually no offer of a full price dessert) and the bill was dropped off with no discount or anything taken off the bill. The total came to $46 so in reflection of our experience I left $50. A tip I felt was generous considering... Oh ya and he took the bill and counted it right in front of us before we left. Must have been his first rodeo.

We decided to celebrate our 4 Year Anniversary at STK last week after thoroughly enjoying our first experience there last year... and we were not disappointed. I have to say we had a wonderful experience. Not only was the food amazing but the service is what really stood out. Great food and and even better staff. Highly recommended.

I hired Real Fast Auto Glass to replace a windshield on my Escalade. They were not an approved vender through my insurance but they had descent reviews on Yelp so I gave them a shot. BIG MISTAKE!   Not only did they crack my dashboard but they tried to tell me they didn't, and took zero responsibility. They told me it was already there. I drive my car everyday, have never seen a crack and the first time I drove my car since having a windshield installed I have a giant crack on my dash. I don't think this is a coincidence.   After speaking with Joe, notifying him I would be writing a bad review he acted like a child and begged me not to write a bad review, yet still offered no plausible solutions. Instead of replacing the dash which would only be $300 he chose to deny all accountability and make no reasonable offer to fix their error.   You can tell this company is ran by a young kid who doesn't know how business works yet. It's clear once he has your, or your insurances money he doesn't look back. I would recommend going with a company your insurance approves to limit the risk of dealing with a sketchy company like this. On a side note, my new windshield also now rattles up by the review mirror. Thanks for nothing Real Fast Auto Glass.

All I can say is wow!!! To give you some perspective of how much I dislike this place, I am writing this from my phone in the waiting room. For starters I drive up and I am looking at the prices on the signs above. An employee (I am assuming the manager) approaches and asks what I would like. I ask for the exterior wash because my interior is clean. He looks at me like I am the cheapest customer in the world and rolls his eyes at me.   I have a Chevrolet Tahoe with nice rims and he explains with much sarcasm in his voice that if I don't do a hand wash he's not buying me new rims. Thanks buddy! That's exactly what I expected, you to pay me $6000 when I got a $6 wash. Long story short the guy was extremely rude.   So I walk into the waiting room, the couch and bar stools were full with customers. The only vacant seats are 2 massage chairs in the corner. There is a slot to pay money and receive a massage, but there is no visible sign expressing the requirement to pay to sit in the chairs. After sitting in the chair for about 30 seconds, an extremely loud alarm starts going off throughout the entire building (inside and outside). The same rude employee comes speed walking in, on a mission from god yelling at me to pay or get out of the chairs... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! Not only is that completely ridiculous to have chairs armed with alarms, but this guy actually enjoys yelling at people to get out of the chairs.  At this point I go straight to my phone to warn the Yelp Community about this horrible employee that only a horrible business would employ. So as I start typing the same employee starts conversing with the guy restocking the refreshments and word for word says " you like that alarm? I put that s#@t on there so mother f*#@ers, can't sit in the chairs unless they pay me".   5 minutes later a little kid, maybe 6 years old has the same thing happen to him. Scared the kid senseless, and the employee didn't mind this one bit. Long story short this man should be fired immediately, I will never go back to the car wash as long as I live regardless of if he is fired or not. Oh ya and my car wash was horrible. My car was still soaking wet when I picked it up. Horrible

If you schedule to come at my house between 9am and 10:30 on a Tuesday when I should be working and you don't bother showing up... You just cost me my day, and more money than you were going to charge me in the first place. Rude, unprofessional and very disappointing. Don't waste your day waiting for a company that doesn't bother showing up

Probably the worst pizza delivery situation I have ever encountered. We tried them for the first time today and it will be the last. We ordered a large half Hawaiian, half cheese pizza and 10 honey hot wings well done. The pizza only had pineapple, no ham, was extremely soggy and way too much cheese. With the wet soggy crust and the heavy cheese all we could do was rip off small pieces to eat because it could not hold its shape but luckily that didn't last long because we didn't bother eating much. The wings were just hot, no honey flavor was detected. I did call to notify them of our discontent, they asked me what I wanted them to do and I responded with it was up to them. They offered to bring me a side of honey hot sauce back and a slice of pizza, "but it's a giant slice" so that should fix everything. I declined and hung up. NOT RECOMMENDED

Arizona Dog Sitting watched  my Siberian Husky this passed weekend. It was a very simple process, Marie came to my home for a consultation before I left so Marie, myself, and my dog felt comfortable with each other. She appeared to have a real gift for animals. My dog loved her, and that's all I can really ask for. Came home and everything was just the way we left it. I will use Arizona Dog Sitting again.

I've used E&E for about a year and have had no issues. I don't see them often because I'm at work during the day but my pool is always clean and I've never had any problems. The few techs I have met are always pleasant. They even fixed my auto filler when it stopped working. I would highly recommend E&E.

Not very efficient. If you are in a hurry I don't recommend this place. It took roughly 25 minutes last night to get 2 burgers, fries, and a shake in the drive-thru.   Small menu. Not a lot of options. The burger is good but the tacos aren't consistent. 2 out of 3 attempts, the meat has been very dry.   The motivating factor for this review was the bugs all over the window and wall where you receive the food from the drive-thru. Easily 150 black bugs on the white wall kind of makes you lose your appetite and probably a health code violation.

The only reason I gave 2 stars was because I've been here 3 times before and enjoyed myself, however this time was extremely disappointing.   Our service was HORRIBLE!!!! Dinner for 4 people who weren't indecisive or stalling took 3 hours and 45 minutes. The server took over 20 minutes to take our drink order, never asked if we wanted appetizers (we did) never mentioned specials (I still don't know if there were any) poured water in my wife's ginger ale, which was surprising because 75% of the time our drinks were empty, and while the restaurant was freezing, but all these things could have been over looked if we ever saw our server!   It gets worse. 2 couples shared 2 filets. One couple ordered theirs medium with a sauce on the side, I don't recall which one and we ordered ours medium rare. Both filets came out pre sliced on the same plate, with the sauce on their filet touching our filet and one steak was over cooked. When the food was dropped I expressed my concern about the filets being pre sliced because I have found the steak gets cold much faster when pre sliced. I explained we would give it a shot but I was very surprised they chose to serve us family style when we didn't request it that way. The server acknowledged my discontent and was never seen from again, or at least until we were well done with our dinner. He specifically said he would check back in and that never happened.   We fine dine often, it's customary for a manager to stop by the table and ask how our experience went, that never happened. Our server never asked how are experience went... If anyone would have asked, I would have told them, but nothing. If it was just me and my wife, I would have requested a manager to complain, but since we had guests with us we left without making it a big deal.   Without exaggeration, in all my experiences at restaurants, both fine dining and casual, I would say this was the most neglectful server I have ever had. I was actually embarrassed for recommending this restaurant for our friends to meet us, it was their first time there and they won't be back. I'm not sure if I will be either.

Not only is this a great example of supporting small/local business... but Sara takes a lot of pride in her craft and is fairly priced. I highly recommend Ifix for anything mobile, mp3, or tablet related.

Anytime the owner is that rude and unprofessional you earn a one star review. Hey Matt, maybe your restaurant would be doing better if you treated your customers with respect. By the way your pasta drowning in cheesy alfredo sauce shouldn't be on the "lighter side" menu. It probably has 3000 calories. NOT RECOMMENDED

After coming here just once I completely get why Tony has so many great reviews. Attention to customer service and pride in what you do goes a very long way. Tony was charming, beard trim looked great, and it's always s good thing supporting small local business.
