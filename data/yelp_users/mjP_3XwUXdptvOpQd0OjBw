There aren't many places in the valley that make me feel I am somewhere unique and 'non-chain' but this is one of them. Yes sometimes the service can be a little off but when this place has it's game on ... it's ON! The wine list is always interesting giving you choices that surprise and please, the food is well priced and the brew-shetta (Geordie accent please) is ridiculously good. I should give this 4 stars as the service can be hit and miss but I gave it 5 for those great nights with friends when the music is loud but not too loud, the wine is flowing and a good time is being had by all!

I recently visited The Nosh Cafe for breakfast and was impressed with the friendly staff and lack of wait times (even when they were busy).   I chose  the South Mountain Burro which hit the spot perfectly. Tasty and filling but not so much that I felt like a lead balloon afterwards!  The most important thing for me was the coffee. Delicious house coffee - apparently roasted locally so that's a winner :).

Such bad customer service at the framing desk. I wanted to custom frame a poster and I have never talked about custom framing to anyone before! The individual couldn't have been less interested and assumed I knew everything there was to know about framing , glass, spacing etc etc. After all that the price was $160 over what was displayed for the size of my poster.   Simply put, they were a customer service disaster.

I thought I was just unlucky. Bad check out experiences every time I come here. But today was exceptionally bad. No line control. No awareness of people waiting. As a grocery store I like it but I lose the will to live while waiting to pay.

These guys are the best of the best. A good range of gear, a great range of helmets and most importantly helpful and friendly staff.  Every time I shop here it's the same. First Class experience. There are other places to go to buy motorcycle/scooter gear but forget it and head straight to this store.  The manager Brian is really friendly and knowledgeable and clearly knows how to manage a great team!

I have just received my business cards from Steve and his team and I couldn't be happier. All the way through the process I was dealt with in a courteous, professional and friendly manner. I will be back here for many more services now I have finally found a printer, designer, copier and small business supporter I can really trust!  Outstanding experience.

I love the 5 and diner over by the 10 off Ray Road ans so we decided to check out this one at the Chandler Mall.  A disastrous breakfast decision. While the service was friendly enough the food was terrible. I have no idea how one location can be so bad compared to another a few miles away but we will never come back here.  There were hardly any diners on a Sunday morning when most other breakfast joints are jammed so I guess that should have been a warning sign from the beginning.

What an disaster of a restaurant. This place is like a fancy version of Del Taco, all show on the exterior and even a flashy interior but then the food arrives. If you like generic faux-Mexican food which is prepared with no care or attention then go for it. Went once, hated it, will never be back.

Good Steaks but no atmosphere. It's a cross between somewhere trying to create a 'scene' and the Outback Steakhouse. Laminated menus and explanations of what 'medium-rare' is kinda says it all for me.

We have tried a few Thai restaurants around the East Valley and for my money Sian Orchid wins top prize.  I had a perfectly spiced Massaman curry and my wife had a Yello curry. Both were super tasty and we agreed that Siam Orchid had just become our 'goto' Thai restaurant.   The service was warm and friendly and the location just a little north of downtown Gilbert is excellent.  Can't wait to go back!

It's been a while since I've had a good breakfast sandwich (NYC and London were the last places) so to discover The Farmhouse Restaurant in downtown Gilbert is great news for my weekend mornings. Yes you have to wait at the weekend, but believe me it's SO worth it. I like the breakfast at Liberty Market and a few Good Eggs around the valley but this place beats them all.  P.S If you love bacon you will be VERY happy!

Approaching ZB for a sunny February lunch I was struck by the crowd at the tables outside seemingly trying their upmost to convince themselves they were in St Tropez and not the Keirland Commons shopping mall. It was such a motley crue of Burberry wearing Benz drivers that it was quite an effort not to burst out laughing. Needless to say I asked for a table inside!  Greeted by a surly host we were shown to a table for two which in classic Bistro style was on the small side but it wasn't a busy Thursday so we had plenty of space. ZB has done a good job with the recreation of French bistro decor but you had the feeling it was more American French than French French. As if they had been to Bourdain's Les Halles in New York and tried their best to recreate the look and feel of his authentic bistro.   I ordered Moules Marieniere with stringier then usual shoestring fries (frankly they were so thin they were worthless). The mussels were tasty and the buttery white wine sauce has a nice kick to it and stood up well to bread dipping at the end of the meal. The mussels themselves were a little rubbery but if you order seafood in the desert I always think you have to be forgiving.  My fellow diner ordered a burger and the small taste I had was a delight, one of the best tasting burgers in some time and a nice lunch size, not huge so you wouldn't be weighed down for the rest of the day.  This was my second visit to ZB. Last time I ordered a really unimpressive Duck Confit sandwich and so I was hoping it would be a better experience all round this time, sadly not ... should a burger be the thing that impresses you most at a French bistro?  This joint is a classic example of having the look but not delivering the product. French bistro food should be fresh and simple but my second time here delivered just an 'OK' dining experience. Small things like the waitress pronouncing the 's' on Moules and the wine menu offering George DuBoeuf 'Morgan' when the wine is actually a 'Morgon'. If you are going to attempt French authenticity you should make sure the details are correct.  The final reason I won't be back was when I turned round and saw the same surly hostess taking her shoe off and rubbing her foot before putting it back on and handling menus.  Non merci.

Simply no other choice for intelligent radio in the Valley. NPR is of course quality but the local stories are excellent as well. When I am feeling a bit more partisan I do flick over to Randi Rhodes on Nova M Radio - 1480 KPHX.

I stumbled across Green in an effort to be a little more healthy in 2010. Tucked away in the corner of a very inauspicious strip mall off Scottsdale Road I can't say I was excited as I walked up to the front door. Luckily that all changes when you walk in where you are greeted with a vibrant atmosphere, really friendly staff and fantastic photographs adorning the walls.  I had a spicy bean burger with to die for thyme fries and I could have eaten the meal twice it was so good. Fresh and tasty is how I would best describe my food and my companions choice too.   I was stuck in a bit of an East Valley rut last year going to the same old favorites but now I can add this terrific little restaurant to my list of regular haunts and I couldn't be happier about it.  Highly recommended.

Excellent dining spot in St Marks Sq of the Venetian.   I started with a delicious Ceasar salad with wonderfully tangy white anchovies. Followed by a pizza with homemade pepperoni ... when a Wolfgang Puck restaurant of this quality makes pizza you know it will be good ... and it was!  Service was excellent, friendly but classy (i.e not in your face every 5 minutes asking 'are you still doing ok?' as if we are all near death!).  I would return in a heartbeat.  P.S The wine was very good value too!

The rooms are nice, a little dull but nice. The big bathroom even in entry level rooms are a massive plus and if you like to soak in a deep tub you will be very happy. The rest of the Casino is nice enough but I think next time I will head back to my usual hangout which is the Mirage.

If you aren't prepared to flash the cash for The Wynn or The Bellagio (and I don't blame you) The Mirage is the way to go. I would have never stayed here prior to the room upgrades but this is now my regular Vegas hotel.   They have great restaurants (BLT Burger) and a Starbucks on premises. Staff are always friendly enough and there is everything you would expect to be able to have a serious gamble in a major Strip casino.  The real gem here is the Beatles/Cirque Du Soliel show 'Love' - I have seen it twice and it really is the best show I have ever seen period.

I wonder if this will the 500th review of Bouchon!?  I have wanted to eat at one of Thomas Keller's restaurants for a very long time and haven't yet got organized enough to book The French Laundry 6 months in advance!  So it was on a May Saturday night in Vegas that my better half and I finally got dinner at Bouchon (we have had a very good b'fast here before). We didn't know before we sat down that Mr Thomas Keller himself was in attendance that evening which I have to believe between the Laundry and Per Se in NYC is a pretty rare occurence in Vegas.   The decor is impeccable and as authentic as anything can be in Vegas. The service was very good but I think I have been in the States so long I expect more prompt service than I was used to living in Europe. There were a few moments where we waited for our glasses to be filled just a moment too long but no sooner had I commented on the fact the waiter appeared (are the tables bugged?!?!).  The food and wine was what you would expect. A poached mackerel first course with Serrano ham was sensational. I was going to go for Moules but ended up with my old weakness Steak Frites. The Frites were 100% amazing but I have to say I have had a much better Steak (accepting the cut of the meat is always flank/skirt etc) at Les Halles in NYC. That momentary lapse aside I continued with traditional French choices by ordering a perfect and I mean textbook perfect Creme Caramel, Alongside a glass of Sauternes the meal could not have ended better.  It was when we finished our desert that we noticed Mr Keller by the long Oak bar and figured even if he didn't cook our food personally you knew his team were bringing their A-Game with him looking over their shoulder!  As soon as I can get another $350 together we will be back (yes, as Stella Artois put it, Bouchon is reassuringly expensive!!!).

This is a five star review only for the outside section of Pure overlooking the strip. We were lucky enough to be at the bottle tables with a velvet rope protecting us from the masses and what a location this place is. The best view while drinking in Vegas, i loved it. I didn't spend anytime inside so can't review Pure from that POV.

How do they make the pastry so English!? It's true, just one bite can transport you back to Blighty. I don't go for thre silly pasties (Chicken Tikka, Jalapeno etc) but instead opt for the Shepherds Pie or Lamb and Mint. I come here for one reason, nostaligic English comfort food and my god they deliver. The mushy peas are out of a can but that fine I like them too! If I lived nearer I fear for my liver as I would sit around all afternoon drinking the draft 1664 ... tempting but scary! This place is straight out of the top drawer but I have to ask what's taking them so long to open the second location on Dobson (or thereabouts)?

Great place for lunch but probably would pass on dinner. Had the spinach, goats cheeser and pancetta salad with a tasty light dressing. Also tucked into a cheese and basil pizza which was thin crusted and light - just what I wanted! It's a bit of a hike from Chandler but if you are close check it out.

I try to buy all my cds at Zia simply to keep indie music stores like this in business. I spent many teenage hours flipping through the LPs at record stores in England and I would hate for the likes of Walmart (what were you thinking ACDC & Eagles?!?!?!) and itunes to become the only places I can buy music. I want selection, new, used, music mag's, tee shirts, posters, all the stuff that Zia does so well.  Stop buying music at the corporations and support Zia ... only when they are gone will you realize how much you miss places like this.

In the mood for some funky mid century furniture to take the edge of your Ikea hangover? This is THE PLACE to come. The owners are as friendly as can be and they are really approachable if you aren't an expert in mid century furniture (like me!). There is also an amazing jewelry store within PMR just ask to see Heidi's works of art!

It's 9.22 am on Monday morning having spent Saturday and Sunday with Team Arizona on the Beginner Rider course and I already have my Motorcycle license endorsement!  The Saturday & Sunday course couldn't have been better run or more enjoyable. The riding coaches, Kevin and Jim made the days fun and easy to learn.   I would recommend this for anyone wanting to become a rider of motorcycles or scooters. Great value for money and these guys deliver the goods!

This is really a 4.5 review!  Our first time for breakfast here and it was pretty great. Friendly welcome, fast friendly service. Food was just right, way above the quality offered at your average chain like Dennys etc.   My only gripe was the hash browns weren't quite as cooked as I would have liked but that's really a small complaint.   Great breakfast spot ... We will be back!

Someone said this place is like Postinos ... HAHAHAHA, yeah right. If you want to be called 'brother' or 'dude' by an inattentive ASU student who couldn't wait tables to save his life but sounds like he's auditioning to be the next Casey Kasem then off you go. Sorry but this place is a triumph of style over substance.

This place is another Logans. It's a family restaurant with zero atmosphere and about an inauthentic as a 'Roadhouse' can be. The staff are highschoolers who are polite one on one but passing a cluster of wait staff makes you feel like you are an extra in a teen flick.   So why give it 4 stars? The steak. I had an 11 ounce sirloin medium rare and while it wasn't Flemmings it was better than Logans, Outback and almost as good as The Keg for a third of the price. It was cooked PERFECTLY, thick, juicy and flavorful.  The side of green beens left a lot to be desired and the fries were just OK but I will be back for that steak for sure.

We went to Noca while staying at the Arizona Biltmore for the fourth of July weekend because it was one of the few restaurants actually open.  Walking in you see the place looks good with soft lighting and cool dark colors. We received a very warm welcome from the owner on arrival and in fact all evening the service was excellent.   Because it was the fourth weekend they had their Sunday night menu which offered a choice of four entrees, steak, fried chicken, halibut or veggie risotto. It's a prix fixe of $35 which gave you a salad and ice cream sundae too.   The salad was just ok for me, drizzling thousand island dressing over basic lettuce with a few other salad items on the plate wasn't my thing. I would have preferred a good mixed lead salad with a well made vinegrette.   I chose the Steak as my entree and I have to say it was excellent. It is Skirt steak that comes pre sliced on a very tasty bed of mashed potato. The steak was both seasoned and cooked to perfection. My fellow diners also loved their entrees.   There is a very good wine list at Noca and it was nice to see a reasonably priced New Zealand Sauv Blanc that I had never tried before ... It was very good and reasonable priced.  We will come back here again to try the full menu but if you are in the area and want some Sunday night comfort food this is a great place to check out.

I wanted to try another Vietnamese place other than Cyclo and friends suggested we try Pho. Well lesson learned. This place is no Cyclo period. The food was just OK and while the service was friendly enough I couldn't help but think it was all a pale imitation of the best Vietnamese joint in Chandler ... so if you are craving this type of food stick with Cyclo.

Spent one night here over the Memorial Day weekend because Travel Zoo did a $99 deal for a night with an upgraded room, free poolside cocktails and no resort fee ... nice!  The resort feels like an intimate village with a very upscale sensibility (Obama did stay here after all!). Our room was beautiful with an amazing bathroom, huge big bed and great outdoor space with outdoor double recliner bed.   We spent most of the day at the adult only Oasis pool which was refreshingly non-sceney. All shapes and sizes were there and the poolside waiters kept the drinks coming all afternoon long!  I would go back to this place in a heartbeat or as soon as they have another $99 deal!

I have just been to this Irish Pub with 3 friends for breakfast and it was an underwhelming experience. The server was slow and forgot parts of our order which meant one of us was waiting while the others were eating.  The food: Eggs ordered over easy were cracked with the yolk leaking Hash browns were mixed with overpowering onion 'Irish' sausages were unimpressive (here's a tip Murphy's Law, buy your bangers from Sprouts)  Perhaps it's because it's a new business but the basics of a decent breakfast shouldn't be that hard to master. I actually like the look and feel of the bar and will probably be back for a few pints and a Shepherds Pie but I would suggest you go elsewhere for breakfast .

As we were at the Montelucia resort for the night we figured we would check out their 'Slow Movement' restaurant Prado. Well slow service just what we received. The place was busy (not jammed) and the waiters just couldn't cope, The service was painfully slow and our guy was frankly jaded. He said all the right things but you didn't believe a word of it.  I had some delicious scallops but with polenta that was essentially fancy grits. I have tasted much better elsewhere. I went on to lamb for my entree which was OK, but again just OK.   To top off the evening our red wine was served at room temperature and I mean Arizona with no AC room temperature! Not good.   I would pass on this place and if you are staying at the otherwise excellent resort. Jump in a cab and head to the nearby excellent Tarbells on Camelback Road.

I am a huge fan of the original Tempe location of the CPC so was very happy to hear a while back that they were opening closer to Chandler in Mesa.  We arrived 2 hours after they opened and although some work was clearly still being done the service was as friendly and quick as ever.  The pasties were the same delicious taste of home that i have become addicted to and like the Tempe restaurant they have a great selection of beers.  The CPC is a breath of fresh air in an area full of chain restaurants and so I will be back for more pasties and beer for sure!  P.S This location has great outdoor seating for lazing the day away over a few beers with mates.

We stopped by here after a recent Diamondbacks game and couldn't have enjoyed it more. I wondered if they would be able to replicate the great atmosphere and tasty food from the original on Campbell but I shouldn't have worried.   New and delicious wines, perfect bruschetta and really down to earth and friendly service means I will be back here for sure with friends.  Tops my list of favorite places to hang in PHX.

I love the Postino on Campbell but for some reason this one I'd even better. The same great wine selection, delicious food and great atmosphere. I come here regularly from Gilbert and think it's worth every cent of gas mileage!

The food is 5 star ... and a good 5 star!!!  The service is really 2 star. I've been a bunch of times and had one great server and the others have been very, very average. Never rude but really underwhelming.   I'll still come back for those addictive tacos but come on guys, you can do so much better on the service.

What a perfect location. The outdoor seating is beautiful and intimate. Perfect for a special occasion (it was our wedding anniversary). However the outside chairs are a strange choice ... Not at all comfortable.   Service was attentive but not too much. We were left to enjoy our meal without the incessant 'is everything still going ok' you have to endure at other restaurants. My only gripe with the service was the overly extensive menu description. It was waaaay too long!  Food highlights were the Escargots & Braised Short Ribs and a truly excellent wine list. We will be back

We checked out The Living Room on it's opening weekend and it was packed. Luckily we managed to score a table pretty quickly in this very cool wine bar/restaurant which looks great and had a good atmosphere going on.  Our party ordered a couple bottles of well priced wines along with a bruschetta selection. I then went on to have a panini sandwich was was OK, nothing stunning but perfectly OK. If you have been to Postino in Arcadia you will recognize the menu immediately and thats a very good thing! Small plates with interesting ingredients is the order of the day here and I am personally thrilled that someone realized this concept would work down in the East Valley. Postino is my favorite restaurant in the Valley but sometimes you just don't want to schlep all the way up to Arcadia for a couple of glasses of wine and an appetizer.   First impressions on a restaurant's opening weekend are always hard as you know they will improve as the weeks go by. There was a DJ on the night we were there that was intrusive to our conversation and added nothing to the evening (let's just hope that was a gimmick for the opening weekend). The wine selection was excellent but the food needed just a little tweaking. My sandwich was OK but could have been a lot better, not as crisp on the outside as you would normally like a  Panini.   In the end I am very grateful to the owners of The Living Room for bringing this type of non-chain, wine-centric dining experience to Chandler where were are drowning in average restaurants. I will be back here for sure and will likely end up as a regular!

Oh fitness ... my arch nemesis for so many years!  Yes, I have joined gyms large and small in the past in London, New York and here in the valley. Frankly they were all the same to me. Uninspiring dungeons with rows of hamsters running on wheels ... you know what I mean!  So then I stumble across Funktional Fitness when i move to downtown Gilbert and things changed. The first thing to say is that this is not a gym. It's a fitness destination where you can work out to make everyday activities easier while losing weight and getting fit. There are group classes, private sessions and even sessions for couples all run by coaches that are genuinely invested in your fitness journey.   I have two private sessions a week with Coach Jeremy and Coach Luis and they are both excellent. My attitude to working out has done a 180 now that I see it can actually be enjoyable when you are in the hands of people that not only know what they are doing but actually care about your results.

I had never eaten at Chick-Fil-A before this location opened and now I am a serious fan. The plain old chicken sandwich has been reborn for me and i also love the nuggets. Mickey D's is going  to take a hit for sure.   Save the Cows, Eat More Chicken

First time here and we had heard great things from friends about their breakfast.   My meal was pretty cold when it arrived and cold hash browns really don't do it for me! The poached eggs were perfect and the wholewheat toast was unusually good but to eat a meal that is half the right temperature and half cold is not great.  Service was very friendly and coffee refills came quickly and without asking which is always appreciated.  Unfortunately breakfast joints are pretty much everywhere in Chandler so when you have such a choice an experience like this is not going to make me come back.

This place is the creme de la creme of Mexi fast food for me. I always get a Carnitas bowl with the hot salsa and it is just delicious every time.  I also really appreciate the way Chipotle cares about organic food, especially their meat.

I wanted a quick eat but not a whole pizza so went for the pesto bruschetta. It was absolutely delicious. Quick, efficient service which is naturally what's needed at the airport. A great price too which means I will be back next time I fly.  Nice work Sauce .

We had heard great things about this place so were excited to give it a try.   Unfortunately it was one thing after another.   - Bored hostess could barely summon the Energy to welcome us. - A server that had paid no attention to our table and when he did seemed to be very distracted.  - Over hyped tater tots were average at best.  - Slow roasted pork was bland and without any typical characteristics that we were looking forward to.  - Tasteless fish and chips. I know the fish isn't meant to be that strong a flavor but you're meant to taste something right? - White wine that came out tepid and once cheap wine gets warm it's undrinkable.   You get the idea. It was a big disappointment.

I waited until I'd been here twice before reviewing and I'm pleased to say both times it was a 5 star experience.   Delicious food, great menu, super cool atmosphere and vitally, really friendly staff.   I was a big Gallo Blanco fan before it closed so that's what got me here. The Tacos are still delicious and the Tortas are amazing.   A perfect location for Sunday brunch on the patio with friends. I can't wait to come back here for dinner too.

Carnitas bowl with the hot salsa is a hit with me ... For now this place has replaced Pita Jungle as my default weekend lunch spot.

I work out here every Friday with Coach Matt and it's every bit as good as the original Gilbert location.  The studio is spacious and has just about everything you can think of to get you back into shape or to maintain your fitness levels.  I do GroupFit and all the other members agree there is nothing like Funktional Fitness in the Valley .... the best of the best for sure!

I didn't stay here or gamble here but stopped in for a drink as we wandered down the strip and came across the 'little' man dressed in green pouring god knows what down the throats of willing participants at the bar. While I wouldn't stay here if you payed me cash it's a hilarious stop off as you make your way down the strip and certainly had a ton more atmosphere than many of its neighbors.

Great greeting. Very friendly staff and seriously delicious food.   I went on opening day so if they keep this up this restaurant will be a big success in the new dining Mecca that is downtown Gilbert!

I've had my share of battling with grumpy office staff at doctors offices, waiting 30 mins or more past my appointment time and then meeting someone that doesn't seem to care what's wrong with me. Most of us have had some version of that experience when we are seeing a medical expert.   One Medical Group is different. Located at San Tan Mall, parking was a breeze. When you enter the welcome is friendly and real. The waiting area is comfortable and modern and then the biggest shock comes ... the actual doctor or PA you are booked to see, walks out to meet you, ON TIME!   I had the pleasure of seeing Barb today who was professional and friendly. Not rushed at all and she took notes instead of me filling out endless forms. Barb listened to my symptoms, asked details questions and came to a conclusion of the best treatment for me.  You can also download an app which has your appointments as well as prescriptions, which I showed to the Pharmacist at Walgreens today to make sure there were no questions. Very cool idea.  There is a $99 annual fee to use their services and I am more than happy to pay it after todays experience. It seemed too good to be true, but after one visit, I am hooked. Great work One Medical.

Our first time at this brand new restaurant and I am please to say it was a first class experience.  We visited for lunch just a couple of days after opening so expected them to still be working things out but everything went smoothly. As a Brit I had to go with their $6 Fish & Chips. For that price I expected a smaller portion but the two pieces of fish were a decent size and it was more than enough for lunch. The fish was tasty and the batter cooked perfectly. Served with Tartar sauce and lemon, these guys understand how to cook my national dish (they even had malt vinegar for the chips ... bloody marvelous!).  My lunch companion enjoyed two 'delicious' fish tacos and also said it was the right amount for lunch.   Well priced, friendly service and a very cool look to the restaurant makes SoCal Fish Company a place I will be returning to again.

I've been to the Pomo in Phoenix a few times and never had a pizza that didn't rate 5 stars. Luckily the brand new Downtown Gilbert location is just as good. I came here for lunch on the day they opened (today!) and chose my favorite, the Napoli.   Fresh, delicious and everything I want from a true Italian pizza. Friendly service and a nice dining room make this addition to the Heritage District restaurant scene a very welcome one.   Highly recommended.

This was my first time at Snooze and I'm happy To say it was some of the best bacon I've ever tasted and the coffee is excellent too.   Not sure about the dancing (#oyvey) but it's another great addition to the downtown Gilbert dining scene.

I visited Abbie for a massage last week and 24 hours later booked weekly appointments for the next month. Her skills are immediately evident and you have complete confidence that you are in the hands of a professional.   Add to that the fact that she is also very friendly makes Healing Touch my only choice for a massage in the valley.

I like the way this location has started to show some one the more indie movies like the recent showing of Winter's Bone.   Other than that its a regular multiplex with has everything you would expect so no complaints at all!

Fantastic. The ONLY Thai restaurant you need to visit in Gilbert.   Delicious Chicken Satay and the Red Curry was perfection.   A regular feature on our #deliciousgilbert tours.
