Bryant's pest control was referred to me by a friend and we've been using them for about 3 months now.  Craig has been nothing short of amazing. He's explained where the bugs hide and what areas of the house we need to seal up. Since using their service, we have seen less bugs and are almost to the point where we are at 0. Overall, I'm very pleased with the service that we have received. If you do end up using them, ask for Craig.

This is by far the best bar in Tempe. They have an amazing selection of beer at a reasonable price and their staff is amazing. It is the best customer service that I have received. Their food is great and it  doesn't take forever to get it.

Hands down some of the best pizza I've had. The employees were very friendly and greeted me as soon as I walked in. This was my first time there so I was unsure what to get and the employees all recommended their favorites. While the family enjoyed the pizza and the wings, it was refreshing to get genuine people who enjoyed what they're doing.

I ordered the teriyaki chicken with beef lo mein and it was amazing. It measured up to some of the best Chinese food I've ever had.

By far the most authentic Bosnian restaurant in PHX. The ćevapi are amazing and the pita is great. I would recommend the cheese one.

I've been to this location a couple of times. First time I was there, I bought an engagement ring and had an excellent experience.   On 12/19/15, I went in and purchased a pendant and a necklace for my fiancé. Since they didn't have it in stock, I was told that if I paid for the two business day shipping, it would arrive on Tuesday, 12/22/15.   When the pendant and necklace didn't arrive on Wednesday, 12/23/15, I called the store and spoke to Cheryl. I explained my situation to Cheryl, and she offered a phone number and suggested I check my email. While she was looking for the number, I checked my email and noticed that the delivery date was set for 1/7/16. I explained this to Cheryl and she took no ownership of the issue. I received a generic apology statement and was told that her employees cannot guarantee the date. She again suggested that I contact a toll free phone number.   No attempt was made to resolve my issue even though I've spent well over 6K in their store and had an open credit line with them. I'm never coming back to this place.

Jimmy Johns advertisement of "freaky fast delivery" is the biggest lie ever. We placed our order over an hour ago and still haven't received our sandwich. 1 hour and 13 minutes and counting.... I called to check on the order and the person who answered the phone informed me that they only had one person delivering food. I normally get this when I order Sunday mornings, but they usually tell me.

I found this gem searching through yelp. My wife is pregnant and is constantly craving authentic Mexican food. After searching through yelp, I found this place and ordered 3 tacos for her. She stated that it reminded her of her nanas cooking. If you're in the mood for tacos, this is the place to go.

I had a great experience with this jimmy johns. They were efficient and delivered my food rather quickly. I ordered three sandwiches, several cookies, chips and drinks. They got everything right.

My in-laws recommended that we try this place. If you've read some of of my other reviews, you may know that my wife is pregnant and is craving authentic Mexican food. We went there with our son and ordered a cheese crisp and bean dip as appetizers. The beans tasted different to me so I didn't eat it. We finished our food and ordered sopapillas for dessert. As soon as the dessert arrived, my kid began to vomit. Being that my wife is pregnant, she threw up as well . The waitres ran to get some napkins for us and was amazing in making sure my kid was ok. While my wife and the kid were in the bathroom cleaning up, the manager approached me and stated that there was a lot of food today as there was a wedding party tonight and that he wasn't the first person to throw up. The waitress brought over a cup of water to go and a different waitress brought me our check. I left a 30% tip for the waitress as her service was great. I couldn't have asked for more from her. I am giving this place a 1 star rating because I found it unprofessional for the manager to tell me that he wasn't the first person to throw up and that it could have been because they prepped a lot of food for a wedding party. Overall, I didn't see myself coming back.

Amazing fried rice along with orange chicken. This is our second time ordering this week and that's very rare because my wife isn't a fan of Chinese. It was her idea to go with Chinese.
