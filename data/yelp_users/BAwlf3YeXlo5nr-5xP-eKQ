Meh. This place used to be amazing! I commend the fact that they have gone organic, but the quality has fallen below par. Our service was less than metocre as well. We were sold on the "5th generation Heirloom tomato caprese" for our appetizer. Nothing fancy, just so so green tomatos and rather bland mozzarella. (Delux has a better Caprese) Our waiter delivered the app without even bringing us small plates to share. The shrimp in my fetticuine bianca was overcooked and rubbery, the sauce was great though. The other entree was mixed up twice. Both weren't even that good. Just blanched ravioli with one premade reheated tomato creamm sauce and the other with a way to salty brown butter sauce. When asked about the notes we were looking for in our wine the waiter wasn't to sure and seemed to stumble through each question we asked about the menu. Dissapointed, but at least my date was beautiful.

Dude this place is the shit! The fastest way to ruin your business is to mix "scary bikers" with sports bar patrons. Guess what? Everyone just wants to have a good time and a couple cocktails. I have been coming here for over 2 years and I yet to see any type of confrontation. From coming here every Tuesday, where they feed you for free while featuring the show "Sons of Anarchy" theater style. (The owner rides a motorcylce after all, that's where "Represent MotherFucker" came from I'm told) Even coming here Sundays for football! It's a lot of fun and the best thing about it is Baseline Sportsbar is a family owned and operated bar. The girls are really cool, and each have their own style. Don't be a dick or a douche and you will have a great time here! Support local, small businesses who support the community.   P.S. My phone died while I was writing this review and not knowing, out of nowhere, the bartender " Jillian" I think, asked what type of phone I had and offered me a charger....that's service!

Awesome neighborhood spot! The bartender Chuck, rocks! (literally, he's in a band called "Grain of Truth") and besides the service, Monday nights ($2 U-call it's) with DjMrEaton have been a lot of fun. Well at least the last three I've been too!

This is by far the best music store in the valley! My first time in almost 2 years ago I got to meet Steven Adler from Guns n Roses, and got a killer deal on a Kustom amp. Since then I've shopped here many times, and they regularly host meet n greets with all kinds of Rockstars as well as sponser local charity fundraisers. I attended one they sponsored for service dogs awhile back. I would rather shop here anyday over that other corporate music store. The staff knows what they're talking about when it comes to music and are really helpful everytime I come in. Support local businesses who support local the local music scene and the community! Today on christmas eve, the guy before me got $900 worth of gear for $450! I got 2 sets of new strings for my strat for only $6. Rock on Naked Daves \m/
