Do not eat here!!! I found a RUBBER SPATULA in my taco, and the waitress did not handle the situation well whatsoever. She apologized for my findings, but that was it, no offer for a refund or remake (wouldn't have accepted but still the offer would've been nice). The chef did not even come out and apologize. DISGUSTING. birds flying around the inside as you eat, too ghetto....

Very disappointed as I went in to get food the other night. Paid for a full Mac & cheese, and upon returning home realized it was only a half. also ordered their chicken southwest salad & there were NO tortilla strips, which frankly is the only reason I drove out to Paradise. Tried searching the Internet for a customer service line & it is not in service. Totally unprofessional if you ask me. They charge way too much for the rip offs they incur on their customers. You have lost the business of my friends, family, & myself.

First time trying this place, fast service, cool water foundation inside. I ordered the gyro, and delicious would be an understatement! 5/5 would recommend to anyone!

Best nail salon I've been to! Great experience. The staff is a couple - Jennifer & Billy, and they are the sweetest! By far the nicest nail technicians I've ever encountered. Although the color selection is rather small, the choices are neutral and good for an older crowd. I managed to pick a bright pink though- totally me. The prices are moderate-not too expensive. Definitely my new favorite nail spot- they won me over with kindness!!! Never in my life have I met such nice nail technicians-as they are usually rude and short with me. I love Jennifer & Billy and recommend this place to anyone!!
