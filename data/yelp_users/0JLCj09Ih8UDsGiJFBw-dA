I have had four bad experiences now. Shame on me for going back so many times. I spent $12 on an express wash yesterday and then it rained. Apparently express wash doesn't qualify for a rain warranty. I think $10 is enough to qualify pushing my car through a machine. Another time we brought our truck in after a lot of rain this summer. We were told it was too dirty and would require a $10 up charge. Are you kidding me?! A third time they talked my husband into the more expensive wash to try to get out scratches and we believe they created more. This company nickels and dimes their customers, provides low quality, and doesn't even stand by their product. Save yourself time and MONEY and go somewhere else!

We love working with Tiffany at Sapphire! Taxes can frustrating and scary, but I always know I'm in good hands here. The company offers online scheduling at your convenience. I received an email and call reminder for my appointment as well. They always professional and courteous. Highly recommend Sapphire!

Officially addicted to their cinnamon rolls!  I have to eat one at least once a week.  I love the old town charm and the amazing service.  I have been back several other times for lunch and have never had a bad meal yet.

Worst experience and waste of money! Waited over 25 minutes to get a wilted, over drenched in dressing salad and a cold sandwich that should have been hot. I waited for another 20 minutes for a corrected sandwich. I wish it was still Paradise Bakery. Save your money and time and go somewhere else.
