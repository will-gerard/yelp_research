I've been in search of the best Chicago deep dish pizza pretty much since I was born.  I have made stops at such places as Old Chicago, Pizzeria Uno and various other pizza joints claiming to have Chicago style deep dish pizza. And I have of course discovered Zachary's Pizza in downtown Berkeley, CA, which I consider to be the best.  I have now discovered second best.  Oregano's Pizza was FANTASTIC the other night, with an outstanding spinach, mushroom and sausage deep dish pizza topped with unbelievable service. We also tried a stuffed portobello mushroom dish which was just wonderful.  There are still a couple slices in my fridge that I continue to find myself staring at, seeking the right moment to have a secondary experience with this delicious food.  Lastly, they have a "pizza cookie" that I'm pretty sure I can't live without. I've made it this far, but I'm not exactly sure how. I am NOT a dessert person AT ALL... this was possibly the best dessert I have EVER had. You cannot leave this restaurant without ordering one of these!  I highly recommend this great restaurant, however I must say that I was not impressed with the wait. We were on a waiting list for over an hour LATE on a Saturday night... guess you pay for popularity.

1 star for manager Bill who proudly proclaimed that, "as a manager, my job is not to make decisions for people but to enforce the company policy." - WOW! Thanks Bill! You're a real winner, and really helpful to boot.  5 stars for the Store Manager Dave who apparently shares a different view of what being a manager means. Thanks to him, I'll definitely return at some point in the future!

Absolutely unbelievable dry cleaners! This business understands customer service and exemplifies it with every interaction. Lee is phenominal. Pretty sure this is the type of business that like a dentist, when you move elsewhere you just have to go back... you know what I mean. I'll be 45, unemployed, living in Philly and still flying to PHX to have these guys clean my clothes.

Seems to be consistent feedback. Second time back here in the last couple days. Pharmacy is slow and disorganized, the phone is ringing off the hook in the background and no one is answering.  Drive up is even worse than going inside, seems like a minimum 20 minute wait just to have some ask for your DOB-- then another 10 minutes for them to find the stuff.  Will go anywhere but here.

Love this restaurant! I'm that annoying person who always walks in here ten minutes before close and asks for take out. They always accommodate and are incredibly friendly! Outstanding food and wonderful people. Pad Thai is great, yellow curry better. Beware of the spice! :)

Best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Period. Nothing compares to their delicious cheese-crisp, fresh tortilla chips and yummy salsa. Oh, and their machaca beef enchiladas with a little extra cheese will have you turning your car around by the time you reach Bethany Home and uncontrollably driving back for round two.*   Their service can be a little rough around the edges at times, but in the end it really doesn't matter. You didn't go to this place to bitch and moan about service; you went here to eat the best dinner you've had all week.   My only last piece of advice... eat a lot early on in the game, their dessert leaves a lot to be desired. They could get some legit honey for the sopapillas (vs. Kraft packets), and the fried ice cream is so-so.

We visited this restaurant late on a Sunday night, which may have taken away from some of the excitement of this trendy upscale restaurant, even still we both really enjoyed our food.  I had the opportunity to try the tangier burger, which was just perfect. The meat would melt in your mouth as you bit into the burger, and the combination of herb pesto, dried tomatoes and cheese was absolutely fantastic.  We also tried the italo kisra, which was described to us as, "it's like pizza." - We frowned at that description at first thinking, "gee, thanks for the help buddy!" However when the food arrived we quickly discovered that there was probably no better way to describe this pizza like food.  The one thing that I disliked about this trip was the pomegranate margarita. I felt that the drink was poorly executed, and at $6.50 a pop it certainly wasn't worth the money. A drink doesn't make the meal usually for me, so this wasn't a big enough deal to give a lower rating.  Give this place a try, I think you'll be impressed.

Unfortunately I cannot live on FEZ alone (though during weekends back in PHX I sure have been trying), so there comes a time in every man's life where he must venture outside the comfort zone and at least attempt to try a new restaurant (even if it IS owned by the same people).  This is where Ticoz Resto-Bar comes in; located within stumbling distance from the apartment I decided on an early dinner with the full intention of hitting happy hour on a beautiful Phoenix evening.  When I arrived at 5:30 the host informed me that every seat on the patio was taken, and that I could sit at the (empty) bar or in the dining room. Not wanting to be "that guy at the bar" I opted for a table in the very dimly lit dining room.  At this point, let's just get the service aspect out of the way... nice guy, very friendly, clearly hadn't seen a one person table in a while. I seem to think that a one person table affords you a unique opportunity to interact differently with your guest. However, I don't feel as though professionalism should go out the window.  The waiter brought my round Tostitos and three types of salsa, which can be characterized as:  1. Hot Salsa - BAD, REALLY, REALLY, BAD. I would rather chug Prego out of a dirty can while undergoing invasive surgery to correct... let's just leave it at that.  2. Pico De Gallo - I was under the impression that Pico De Gallo salsa should be chilled when brought to the table, once I got over the fact that my salsa was warm, this was actually pretty good.  3. Pineapple - OMG, WHY THE HELL DO THEY EVEN PUT OTHER SALSAS ON THE TABLE??? SERIOUSLY, THIS STUFF WAS FANTASTIC!!  Shortly after this I ordered the first of what I expected to be many mojitos, at 1/2 price I was ready for an enjoyable evening with my new vice the mojito. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the outcome. Maybe I should have read the menu a little closer, but the mojito was nothing more than brown sugar water, maybe some rum and a smattering of mint leaves. I drank about 1/2 and decided that it wasn't worth finishing. They clearly need to learn a better simple syrup, or buy the pre-mixed Bacardi Mojito, they'd be better off.  Now in all fairness, I ordered cheese enchiladas for my dinner and they were actually VERY good. Though it isn't very hard to mess up such an easy dish. I was impressed with the amount of cheese that was used as well as the decoration of the plate. Can't say the same about the rice (tasted like it belonged not in a Mexican restaurant but rather a bad Indian restaurant) or the beans, which were just sort of there.  Overall I am disappointed with Ticoz, even though they are owned by the same people that own my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. They obviously have some work to do in this direction before I will be going back again. So I will continue to find a way to live off FEZ alone, or at least until I can muster up the courage to try something new, again.

There is something special about walking into a place where everyone knows your name. Cliche, sure, and does it bias my opinion of a place? Absolutely. Either way, Cantina Laredo is still a great restaurant.   What really draws my attention to Cantina Laredo (other than the worlds greatest employees) is the happy hour. Most importantly their happy hour runs until 7pm. For the self proclaimed workaholic that I am, this is very important. Ever get off work at 6:30pm only to drive home wishing there was a place still serving $3 margaritas? Happens all the time... now there is a fix.   The food is delicious, most everything on the menu is exceptional; though a few things really stand out.   1. Table side Guac- yes I know, it's been done before, but who cares! They make it next to your table and it's delicious.   2. Pulled pork anything (ie. sliders or shanks). This stuff is marinated perfectly and I can attest to the fact that you will not find anything this fantastic between here an the south pole.   3. This flaming apple pie thing they have for dessert will give you a contact drunk from both the sugar and the alcohol that is contained within.   4. They have Negra Modelo on tap, usually served in an icy (like actually icy) tall glass.  Good food, good people, good choice.

An outstanding business model with wonderful people to execute makes for a very successful enterprise.  I've been a loyal Southwest customer for many years, traveling for both business and pleasure frequently. But Southwest was not an easy choice. Growing up in Denver and watching Frontier grow as the hometown airline where you couldn't help but have an emotional connection (I was incredibly loyal to Frontier). However, unlike Frontier, or others that try to make you feel special on the outside, but slowly push you towards the realization that they're nothing more than just a money making facade, Southwest is the real deal.  First, no great business can have mediocre people. And I'm convinced that mediocre are bred at large facilities specializing in making people robot drones that have no personality, no ability to think critically and follow an exact script- insert US Airways training facility here.  Southwest however actually allows their employees the freedom and ability to ACT! Their opinions respected and their decisions honored. What other airline allows their flight attendants to "buy" the guy in seat 22A a drink for moving yet a few more rows back to accommodate a family with screaming children? Unfortunately in most other places that drink would have been inventoried, check-listed and held under lock and key until the payment cleared the Federal Reserve and Alan Greenspan returned back to Washington to approve.  Second, the business model. For the customer it's easy, it's convenient and it's actually flexible! You can figure out with a very low IQ exactly how everything works. Need to change a ticket? Yes, and there is no, "bam! surprise $150 change fee."  Fly frequently? In a very short period of time you're considered a loyal customer and placed on the A-List or A-List Preferred- which also happens to be the best loyalty program in the world. Yes, I said it... world! If you disagree, go educate yourself. Free priority baggage check and priority security screening so that arriving at the airport 2 hours before your scheduled departure isn't necessary- yes please.  Kind of like the tooth fairy as a kid, though even more unexpected Southwest actually puts stuff in my mailbox. The most beneficial of which are my annual birthday card (1 of two birthday cards I received this year; thanks mom) and DRINK COUPONS! Hooray for free drinks.  I keep reading reviews that say Southwest is great for short flights, however I believe that Southwest is great for ANY flight. I also read reviews about the uncomfortable seats... really? At 6'5" I would consider myself just shy of an expert on airline seating arrangements. Really though, the experts over at SeatGuru have confirmed what I've known to be true for a very long time. Southwest seats have more space between the seat in front of them and the best "full, upright position" seat pitch. Unless you pay for an upgrade over at US, Southwest has the most comfortable seats in the airline business.  --Side note, I actually have to sit with my feet elevated off the ground on most planes as the distance from my lower back to knee is greater than the space between the back and bottom of the seat and the frequent flier magazine crammed into the seat back pocket of the seat in front of me. Now that just sucks- and I don't have to deal with that with Southwest.  Overall, a phenomenal airline with great people that make flying just a bit more exciting and dare I say it, enjoyable. Thanks Southwest- you guys rock!

I have recently scoured the depths of the internet trying to find a decent review of That's Italiano. It is only AFTER I have returned from eating there that I begin to find information on this restaurant. Humph! I'm a little upset... Joke.  Anyways, it's a lovely evening back in the good ol' Phoenix area and I have once again just stepped off a plane and am pretty much dying of hunger; only, it's not just regular type hunger, it's lasagna type hunger. Then I remember that there is this pretty neat looking place next to the dry cleaners I've been going to, that I have wanted to try for a while.  As usual I am by myself, so all of the cliche jokes about my "Party?... Party of ONE!" apply. Though again, despite the fact I am by myself and probably going to go home and write about my experience on Yelp! Does NOT make me a loner, loser, cheapskate or any other name you can think of, but apparently they thought so.  The first gal I talked to had me walk her to the table I wanted (I certainly had my selection as only three other tables were occupied) and left me with a smile and a menu, and in all fairness I must say that she was by far the most attentive and energetic person working in the restaurant that evening.  Shortly there after a guy brought me a basket of bread and oil and walked away to finish putting new butcher paper on every table and rearranging the glasses and silverware to be presentable for tomorrow's crowd.  Roughly seven minutes later, after trying to position the menu in every way possible to signal, "Hey! Look over here, me, me, me... I'm ready to order now!" Another new waitress came to my table and apologized for the misunderstanding, she thought the other girl was taking care of me. All the while the guy with the bread was organizing the tables around me, but never thought to mention that I just might be waiting for some help.  I then ordered the lasagna, a glass of wine to go with dinner and a side salad and at this particular moment I'm not sure any of those were really the right choice.  First, let's start with the bread (the one bright spot) HOLY HEAVENLY supposedly fresh baked bread! Without the vegetable oil w/ cheese you were magnificent! With the funky oil and cheese? Meh...  Then came my salad, apparently people have a difficult time chilling things that should be cold prior to serving them to me. I am again of the camp that believes salad should not look like Detroit in late February (ie. freezing), but should also not be sweating because it has been sitting at slightly higher than room temperature in the kitchen for the last six hours. The "Italian dressing" was really more like "I can't believe it's not butter-ian dressing." In addition they do not offer a dinner salad, you must purchase the $4.50 regular salad... maybe, just maybe a buck fifty and I might do it again, four fifty... "hellz" no!  At this point I am really hoping that my lasagna tastes like winning Powerball when the jackpot reaches 993 trillion, because if not, well this restaurant has a lot to be desired.  Then just as I am dreaming of the cheesy goodness that is lasagna, out of the kitchen it comes in all its glory.  Only one problem... it is just a piece of lasagna that I'm pretty sure they baked a pan of earlier in the day stuck on the plate with two gobs of meat sauce on either side and sprinkled with oregano or some other spice to add decoration.  Considering I am paying $12.50 for this nondescript overcooked noodle concoction, I would recommend that maybe they put the plate in a burning garbage can to add some excitement and possibly flavor. I'm so under whelmed at this point that I try to hustle through it and my "house" red wine; which was comparable to Trader Joe's three buck chuck (damn, you mean I could have gotten a bottle for what I paid for a glass?).  After finishing 85% of the lasagna and chugging the wine I called it a night. Sorry That's Italiano, with all the potential you have to be a classy, unique, wonderful Italian restaurant... you've got a ways to go.

We love this place and find the location, service and food to be top notch!  We've been multiple times and often visit the Lounge next door afterwards.  I'd highly recommend the pizza, lasagna (or pretty much any of the pasta dishes with red sauce) and they recently had these delicious meatballs as a special appetizer. Absolutely out of this world and not to be forgotten if available.  Plus, pretty sure you can never have too much Amy. She's a staple here- and an awesome personality. Pretty sure it'd be impossible to leave unhappy if she's serving you!

I'm grateful to Andy B. for writing the first review of Benedict's and talking about their outstanding desserts. I have been in several times for lunch and am completely impressed with everything. They've even turned an iced-tea cynic into an aficionado with their passion mango iced-tea. Great food, great environment (with sweeping views of the McDowell Mountains from the patio... that I may have embellished slightly) and great people. It's nice to find a place that has all three elements executed very well. They also do an outstanding breakfast / brunch on the weekends with some amazing options. I highly recommend a drive over to Dawn and Kelsey to check this place out.

Love this stadium, and love the teams that play here each spring!  Sunscreen is provided complimentary thanks to Dignity Health in the outfield area, which I still think is one of the smartest marketing ideas and overall a very, very generous amenity.  Good food-- apparently the Cousins Maine Lobster food truck is making appearances this year, but beware that they're not there for all games and it seems difficult to find an accurate schedule anywhere.  Aside from that, typical food options exist. Hot dogs pulled from drawers in the concession areas, beer galore though hardly any exciting ones anywhere except at Salty's and even using the word exciting there is a stretch.  You can find better hot dogs on the grill on the concourse above first and third. Plus it's a classier bet than trying to sneak a dry $1.50 Costco dog into the game in your cargo shorts, and then loading up on the complimentary condiments near the concession areas.

We found this place back in early May, posted a picture & some business information on yelp and look how quickly this took off! This place isn't gourmet, but it definitely hits the spot! Thanks for opening a really good Indian place in the neighborhood.

We had these guys do some t-shirt printing for a company picnic that we had, and were looking for team t-shirts. Originally lured in by the $5 t-shirt vehicle wrap on a van parked near my home, we called in and said, "saw the sign," not in an Ace of Base voice, "what can you do with a 72 hour lead time?"  Pretty much anything... cool.  So, we sent over an extremely pixilated image of what we wanted, which they were able to help find a version that was actually workable and off to the races we went!  After several phone calls with us changing our mind (maybe 'several' is an understatement) we had proceeded to build what many would've seen as the worlds most expensive custom company picnic t-shirt. For us, approximately $13 per shirt seemed like a steal.  So, 72 hours later, we had spiffy new t-shirts, and while we looked stylish at the picnic, we didn't win any of the events. So, if you're looking for a cool shirt for a low price... look here. If you're looking for a winning lottery ticket to pop out of your shirt pocked, or you just need some general luck-- keep walking. Or pick up one of the pre-printed shirts with a funny saying that they have in stock, and at least you'll have laughed today.  BTW- the attached photos are after 2 (maybe 2) washes in the washing machine.

Wow-- this place is good. Need a taco fix? This is it!  We shouldn't have been surprised that all the meat was shredded vs. grilled or al pastor style but once the initial shock disappeared and my mind opened to a street taco concept other than what we were used to, it was game on.  If I could order a bathtub full of the barbacoa and then spend the next several days passed out in a tub of deliciousness, I'd be able to die a happy person.  They suggested a green avocado salsa while we were paying saying, "you MUST try it!" So we did. Yum. It's pretty freakin' hot, but when consumed in moderation adds a nice level of heat to the situation.  Looking forward to trying things beyond the tacos-- like an enchilada stuffed with green chili pork, or a burrito filled with the adobada. And I just might have to bring a bathtub next time... I suppose if I succeed, you'll know. Cheers!
