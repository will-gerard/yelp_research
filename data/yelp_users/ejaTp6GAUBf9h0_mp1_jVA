Delicious food. Excellent service. Friendly prices. Cute, unique setup. Love this place.  I always get the huevos rancheros if possible and am somehow always disappointed by the quality or unable to finish the food. The huevos rancheros here are to die for. I finished it all.  My boyfriend got the french toast combo and also cleaned his plate. I had a bite of his french toast ...so good.  We also got the chocolate milkshake and it was nice and rich and creamy. The waitress also gave us the extra leftover milkshake that she couldn't fit in the glass. Killed that too.  The waitress was really welcoming and down to earth. I noticed her colleagues were just the same with the other patrons: super friendly, taking pictures for them, etc.  We sat aside and the giant umbrellas provided a lot of shade, which made the experience super pleasant. There's a little water fountain and a church as a backdrop.  This is a definite favorite and must-return next time I'm in Scottsdale.

The selection here is great. There is a lot of everything -- hats, gear, etc. But the customer service blows.  My boyfriend and I came in so I could get a hat and a pair of tan golf bottoms.  A cashier said hi when we entered, and a guy in passing greeted my bf when we were in front of the hats, but that was it.  I was in the women's section for the longest time, trying to find a pair of shorts in my size. I am only 5'2" so I struggled to check the shorts on the top shelves. No one offered to help.  Two workers made eye contact with me and then looked away. One of them was in the women's section putting together a display -- only a couple feet away.  I let myself into an open dressing room because no one was even within the proximity, despite a sign directing customers to find an associate for assistance. With the cool fuck-you attitude I'd gotten so far, I highly doubt that would have been a wise or efficient choice.  When I finally decided on my shorts and hats I stood in line for 5 minutes. There were two cashiers -- the one that had greeted us -- and another guy who was joking with his co-worker while the latter was practicing his golf swing with a driver in front of him. The second cashier saw me but didn't do anything. I just figured maybe he was on a break or something. It wasn't until the first cashier motioned toward me that the second cashier started to ring me up. His attitude was terrible.  I'm aware that I don't look like the typical customer in a Scottsdale golf store -- young, petite, Chinese, and female. But that's no excuse to not even greet me, never mind helping. Pretty disappointed. I spent good money here and expected better/friendlier service.

Loved this place!  Service was great: friendly and quick. The food was delicious and artfully arranged. Ambiance was trendy.  The food is a little expensive for a casual night out, and I would not recommend coming here if you want a quiet, intimate date. But otherwise had a great time and will return.

Solid food and service. I like that they use all locally grown products.  We came on a weekday and it wasn't that busy at all. I assume it gets way more hectic at night. The outdoor seating was pleasant. My only complaint is that the food took awhile to come out, but the quality was good.

Loved this place. Tasty food, affordable prices, great vibe. Attentive service. Casual crowd. Valet parking.  Iced coffee and the iced coffee with vodka ...two thumbs up!  Only negative is that it was hard to find for us, but I'm sure someone who is not directions-challenged will be just fine.
