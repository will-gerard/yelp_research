Went here with my family and the food was awful! Couldn't even finish our burgers. The French fries were the only thing that was edible. Not to mention we didn't have good service. Took 20 min to get our drink refills. I will never go to Johnny rockets again.

My family and I stopped in yesterday for the first time to get some milkshakes and we fell in love with this cute little place. The serve was amazing and everyone was very friendly. It was a Thursday night and they had live music playing for throw back Thursday and the music was awesome. My husband and I got milkshakes and my 2 kids got kiddie sundaes. So happy we found such a great place to get ice cream now instead of going to Dairy Queen. Will recommend Berties to anyone! Loved it and had such a great experience. Thanks!!!

The food and service is the best that I have had at a place like this. Our chef was excellent as well. We had the filet and it was just as good as an expensive steak restaurant. Will def come back next time I am in Vegas.

Have now been to bootleggers twice and I will continue to go back. The food is amazing and same with the service. Tried the Apple Pie moonshine, which is their house moonshine, and it's prob the best drink I've ever had. Love the menu and BBQ choices. The ribs on the dinner menu are amazing and the grilled cheese add pulled pork for lunch was awesome. Will def come back and will recommend this place to anyone!

Such a great place to bring the whole family! The staff is amazing and so friendly, they try to make your experience amazing too. Landon is great with kids and really helpful with birthday parties. Every time we go my kids request that he is here! I def recommend having birthday parties here especially during the summer months! Such a fun place!

I have now been back since my last post 3 times and 2 of the 3 times makes me never want to come back again. My daughter wanted to have her 3rd birthday party here so we planned it and it was suppose to start at 11am on a sat morning. We got there to bring the cake and some balloons and little decorations at 1045 and nothing was even close to being set up and our "party host" was no where to be found. People started showing up around 11 and still nothing was set up. Talked to the manager and they apologized saying they are short on staff, it was then time for pizza and they just dropped the pizza off having no plates or napkins and it took me about 10 min to find someone to help get me some plates. We decided to do the cake right after the pizza and again no one was around to help us. We paid for the middle package which includes a "party host" but yet we never saw her once. Spoke with the manager Landon and he was the only person willing to help and was nice enough to take a percentage off our total and give us a couple of free items.   I then made the mistake of signing my son, whose 5, and daughter, whose 3 to participate in their "summer camp" when I was there signing them up in the morning one of the blonde owners was there and saying they are perfect ages and will have so much fun. So I left them there around 930 and planned on picking them up around 1230. Around 12 I received a phone call from a friend of mine who took her daughter to jump city to play for an house saying my 3 year old daughter was not being watched at all, trying to leave the building, and when her and her daughter went to leave she tried to leave with them and she had to bring my daughter back into jump city and find someone who worked there to leave her with. I was shocked when I heard this because I paid for a camp where there were suppose to do multiple activities and play with the kids and actually watch them. I called them and went down there right away to pick them up and the Blonde owner who was there again was so RUDE stating that if my kids feel comfortable leaving the facility they CANT stop them!!!! I almost lost it on her and requested to copy of paper work I signed stating that my husband and myself were the only 2 people allowed to take them out and we had to have valid ID. She then lied to my face and said she told me that when I signed them up that morning she told me that they were prob too young!!!!! I took my kids right away and left  I am telling everyone I know, including some friends who work in the news to try to get this out about the horrible owner of this place! DO NOT SIGN YOUR KIDS UP FOR THE SUMMER CAMP!!! You never know who they will let them leave with!!!!

Such a bad quick car wash! My stepdad and my self went about 2 times each and we both have tahoes and the second time we used the car wash we noticed huge scratches and scuff marks down the sides of our vehicles. Will never ever go here again and told everyone I know. Clean freak is a much better car wash and is just down the street. Do not go here!!

Love One Stop Nutrition and was so happy when they opened on 44th street. Great Store has everything you could possibly need for health and nutrition. Owner is extremely friendly and knowledgable about the products, also makes great protein Shakes! Recommend to everyone instead of going to hi health or GNC!

We have been taking our Great Dane to Ashley for a while now and we couldn't be happier with the work she does! Ashley is by far the best person I have ever met with Dogs and I have never felt so safe and comfortable leaving our dog with her. Our dog always comes back home looking and smelling fresher than ever for weeks! Recommend her to every dog owner I know!!
