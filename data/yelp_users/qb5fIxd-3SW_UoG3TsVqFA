Rooms were a little dated but it's the staff that made this place shine.  Upon check-in, we were immediately greeted by very friendly front desk attendants.  Upgraded without asking to a larger bed(since I must have booked a double and it was clear it was not that kind of weekend) Warm cookies are given out to everyone that checks in.  When we got lost finding the exercise facility(which was fantastic) and had to cut through a busy ballroom setup, we weren't given glares, just friendly directions to the weight room.  But their maintenance staff, who tried tirelessly to fix our remote control so we could order movies really showed what resort customer service should be.  After trying 5 different things with an almost annoying amount of good manners, they finally upgraded our room, again, made sure the T.V. was working properly, moved our bags for us, credited us for a free movie, and of course, offered more warm cookies!

Just glancing at the other poor reviews on here, I'm willing to bet the young lady with the lousy attitude is the very same one we were unlucky enough to have serve us tonight. I don't think I've seen someone who was worse at hiding their contempt for service in a while. After serving only half the table their food and disappearing, trpuble calculating the bill, and multiple other mistakes, it truly seemed like we were really annoying her having to inquire about her errors. Passive aggressive, forgetful, apathetic and complacent, this otherwise fantastic Pita joint, really needs to do some staff-housecleaning.

Every Friday at our office, anywhere from 3-8 of us order breakfast from Yvonne's. Their breakfast is decent, they have a very inexpensive daily special, and they are one of the few places nearby that delivers.  The last few Fridays, they have shown their irritation over us paying individually for our food, until last week, when they refused to split any more orders from us more than 3 ways.  Well, we simply found somewhere else to order breakfast who were happy to have our business.
