I haven't been to Ajo Al's in about 12 years (since I left to go to college) but it is still just as good as it used to be. I had the chicken fajitas, which might seem expensive at $15, but I'm a big guy and there was enough food for left over lunch the next day too. Overall, if you are looking for a good tex-mex sit down restaurant, don't pass up Ajo Al's. If you are looking for a cheap carne asada burrito, look elsewhere.

I've been going here since it opened. The menu has changed over the years, but the quality of food has not.   I had the braised short rib for dinner. My wife had the pollo asado. Both were delicious. I've never seen pollo asado served on the bone, but it was a nice surprise.   The restaurant only has about 20 tables, so it can be crowded, especially for large groups, but well worth any wait you have.

Great food. So, why the 1 star review? Walked in and the restaurant was so stifling that I couldn't breathe. Asked for the air to be turned on. I received a snide comment. Then they cranked the air on so high that everyone in the restaurant was shivering. Someone at another table asked for it to be turned down. The waiter said "well, if it wasn't for those people over there (us) it wouldn't be so cold." Thanks jackass. Waiter was rude rest of the night.

Very nice pieces, especially at 50% off. If you are looking for southwest inspired jewelry, rugs, art, etc, this is the place to go.

Great stuff if you can deal with the mess and the crowds. Got some Ferragamo shoes for $40. No returns, no cell phone coverage, and no idea what you will find. Just be sure to double check all items before buying.

Great pizza. Decent service. A bit pricey. But the pizza cookie... Oh the pizza cookie. How I love you so. Got the pesto chicken deep dish. Well worth the hour wait.

Great nightclub. Drinks are pricey, as to be expected. I really like the inside-outside atmosphere. Helps to keep the club from being 120degrees. Dj was top notch and the gogo dancers are a nice touch.

Great place to watch football since they have big TVs and are non smoking. However, our waiter ruined the experience. I've never seen someone in a Vegas casino as rude and curt as he was.   Tip, get a players card. It's free and saves 10% on your bill.

Not even worth my time to write a full review. Chicken is very dry, prices are high, service is terrible, and they got rid of the flower tortilla chips. Stay away.

Great mix of eclectic food. I had the jerk pork plate. The seasoning was fantastic in the rice that we came with was great to mix with the pork. Only deducting one star because the restaurant is very dark making it hard to read the menu, the parking is not great, and we waited over an hour to get a table for four. But after eating at this restaurant I can understand why they were so busy. Great restaurant in the heart of Phoenix. Worth the drive.

I saw these guys at a corporate event and they're FANTASTIC. They transition from 50's to 60's to 70's to 80's so seamlessly that you'd imagine that they can play anything.... Then they started with the live karaoke. What an awesome way to do karaoke, with a great band backing you up. A+.

Not nearly as good as the original in LA. One nice thing is the 3am closing time. Skip this outpost and save yourself for the original.

For the amount we were paying, I was severely disappointed. We had a 2bd/3ba suite. Had to call and ask 3 times for more towels. Shower handles were loose. 3rd bathroom (half-bath) door lock was broken. Returned to our room at 2pm one afternoon and the room still hadn't been cleaned. Great location but terribly managed.

Great little hidden diner right on 16th st. Monte Cristo's are on point. The muffalata is good (would be better with authentic bread, not a hoagie). Nice staff. Old school feel. Great prices. I'll be back for sure.

I used to think that bellagio had the best champagne brunch. Wicked spoon is much better. Don't come here if you are expecting pancakes and waffles. Their food is gourmet and delicious. Angry Mac and cheese is amazing, great braised short rib, and perfect leg of lamb. Well worth the $$. Did I mention its a champagne brunch??

$50 to climb 6 flights of stairs? Strike 1. Terrible use of space so I feel like a sardine. Strike 2. $18 for a well rum and coke??? Strike 3. At least the music was good. I will never be back here. XS is right next door and 10x better.

I've been remiss in writing this review, as I went here almost 8 months ago. The food was good and the prices were even better. I don't remember exactly what I had, but that's ok because my food was good, as was my wife's and my mom's. So, I feel confident in going back at any time and getting a good meal.

If you are looking for great traditional southern bbq, this is the place to go.   Their ribs and brisket are great. I am a southern BBQ lover, so I appreciate the fact that my meat was rubbed only and I could sauce it myself.   Owner is a very nice guy; typical southern hospitality with a noticeable drawl, and provides a mean plate of BBQ.   Odd hours, so make sure to check before going.

I have now used Kimberly for 6 transactions. 4 purchases and 2 sales. Her professionalism through the entire process and her ability to make the process as simple as possible is truly appreciated.   The last purchase that I made with Kimberly was for a very specific type of property that was difficult to find, but Kimberly, being the expert that she is, found the property, out negotiated 3 other offers, and concurrently closed on the house while selling my old house at the same time. A lesser agent would have never made it happen.  If you are looking for an agent that is going to be your biggest advocate, won't waste your time, and will go above and beyond to make sure you're 100% taken care of, Kimberly is your only choice.
