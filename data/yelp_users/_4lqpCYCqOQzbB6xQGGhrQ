Overpriced and mediocre food at best.  The reason I gave this two stars  is because you can buy cool shirts.  Who doesn't want a Hard Rock Cafe Phoenix shirt? ...heh.  I think the nostalgia has worn off on the Hard Rock Cafe after all these years.  It's no longer (not sure it ever has been) THE place to hang out at.    Two stars because it's still the Hard Rock Cafe.

George & Dragon is definitely a cool place to hang out, have a drink and watch sports with your friends.    A few of us went here a couple weeks ago before an evening event.  We grabbed one of the large half circle booths near the windows.  A waitress came over, took our drink orders and told us about what was good. Now Ive heard the Fish & Chips was the best in town.  So after looking at the menu, my girlfriend and I both got that.  Im a huge fish & chips fan...  So I will try any and all of them. Plus being Friday, they are usually all-you-can-eat.    Our meals came out and I was ready to dig in.  It smelled delicious.  When I took a bite, I noticed that it was crunchier than i usually like.  Almost too crunchy. I asked for a couple sides of sauce to dip it in.  Seems I used up both sides pretty quickly.    Ok, the fish was good.. but it didnt blow my mind and it wasnt the best.  So far my favorite Fish & Chips is Fox & Hound over on Bell Rd & 83rd.  Still G&D is a great place! .. I will order something different next time.

This is where all the hipsters and downtown people go after work.  It's pretty packed, but a nice place.  Staff is very cool and you get your drinks out in a reasonable time.  I love the outside seating. There is plenty of it.

We had this for lunch today.  I had split a Spinach salad with 5 medium wings. I'm a wing person and love good wings; however these were far from great.  They were tiny wings and the sauce was just too watery and not great.  The salad had wilted spinach.  I picked pieces to eat, but threw much of it away.  I wont be back.    I gave it two stars because a co-worker liked her sandwich.

There's a reason this place has sold over 700,000 chicken fried steaks!  We went here last night and that's exactly what I ordered.  I couldn't believe the amount of food I got once it was there.  The hot gravy on top of it, along with a side of mashed potatoes.  Amazing.    Before dinner though, they bring out fresh biscuits, which I quickly buttered up and coated with honey.    This review was based on my own dinner.  The four stars was for the chicken friend steak.  Im being generous because on the downside, the salads we got seem wilted and old.  Our waitress at times was too busy talking to people than checking to see if we were ready to order or go. My girlfriend got shish kabobs and wasn't too much of a fan.. especially after she tried my CFS.  haha.. My friend got the pork chops and it seemed too much fried food. Weird?   Overall it was good, but there was room for improvement.

This is probably my favorite of all the Starbucks in town when it comes to the look and feel of what a Starbucks should be.    Years ago this was a typical Starbucks, but recently they remodeled it and the look is just perfect for what SB is.    The staff is great and insanely nice.  If you need anything, they are more than happy to help and assist.  Of course making sure the drinks taste great is important too and I've never been disappointed.  I work close to this location, so its on my way to work.  Love it here.

Honey Whole Wheat, double toasted, with butter and peanut butter...   Don't go "ewww that's gross!!"  try it. . it's delicious.  So that's my order every time I go to Einsteins and guess what? These guys are the one location that can make it just perfect.  I live right next to one and I had to ask them to triple toast it one time because their toaster was set to "warm blown air"  .. well not really, but it seemed like it.  Then the girl putting on the peanut butter, might as well have been using a tea spoon for the tiny amount she gave me.  So not to bash that location.. but yes, this place just rocked.  they are super fast and if you get there at the right time, there is no wait.

I used to always take my car here years ago to get washed.  For the actual wash job, they still do a decent job at best.  I gave it two stars because the place has literally turned into a dive of a car wash place.  I get that car wash places aren't supposed to be fancy, but this place had a very nice interior, food, drinks, tons of stuff to do while you waited for your car.  I took my car here a few months ago; upon walking in, i got the feeling like they were closing up shop.  I asked the lady at the counter why all the car accessories they had on the wall are gone?  She said they were remodeling..  I didn't buy it.   Nothing was there, nor had been for quite some time.  Their cushions that people could wait on were worn and tore up.  the good items they had for sale were all gone.  it now had the walmart or swapmart feeling.    So I also got an oil change, and I always hate getting my oil changed there (yet do it) because they always try and sell you tons of stuff.   I now get my oil changed at Jiffy Lube.. quick and cheap.  I will never go to this place again.  It used to be great, but not anymore.  I don't recommend it really unless you are desperate.

This is the first NYPD I believe and I was here on opening day.  Back then the pizza was insanely good and overall it still is.  We went here for dinner while we doing Hell City at the Biltmore.  Figured it was cheaper than spending $200 on dinner there.    My girlfriend and I ordered a couple slices of pizza.  My only problem with the pizza was that it seemed the crust wasn't as good as it usually was.  I wondered if they changed it or it wasn't cooked all the way.  Usually when I eat their pizza I will destroy their crust at the end..  I ate it, but it wasn't the same.  They are also a Pepsi vendor, so that's a plus for me.    NYPD is still my favorite pizza place, but this past visit wasn't the best for me.

I walk in here with the intentions of getting an egg salad sandwich, when the three people in front of me order a "straw" sandwich.. basically pastrami, sauerkraut, melted cheese and bread.  Damn that sounds good!!  So i end up getting the same thing with a side of fresh fries and a pickle.  These sandwiches are big enough to share with someone, but with me starving like I was, I quickly polished off the entire thing.  it was yum.  I used to go to the one that was at Christown, but it's been closed for many years.  I was happy when they opened up this location.  It's right next to work, so that helps.  I will be back!

Ive only been here for their donuts after a fellow employee brought some in.  If you want the freshest, most delicious donuts around, you have to come here.  I'm a simple glazed donuts person, so I usually get a couple of those.  But they do so much more than just donuts there too, just go in and check it out.

I checked out this location based on the one review I read.  I showed up and there was nobody in line, so it was helped right away by a very  nice woman (forgot her name).  She got my information and since I used their Chandler location, I was already in the system.    Richard (who was mentioned in the previous review) came to talk to me about some services that were needed, but not pressing.  I was happy that he wasn't a pushy salesman like most places.  I got some new windshield wipers on top of my oil change along with a filter.  i was out the door with about $70.  I was happy.  I appreciate their honesty and their timing was perfect.  I was there probably about 20min max.  Would definitely go here again!!

Here's why Dizzy's rocks..   Brandy and Jasmine just kick ass as bartenders and know how to take care of their customers.  You will never go thirsty!  We like to meet up here every so often and hang with our friends for hours here.  We end up just drinking, singing to the juke box and playing darts. For a small bar, this place really is the sh*t.  Im not really the bar type, but my girlfriend turned me on to this place and I just keep coming back.  Awesome people, awesome times.  Dizzy's is the place!    Why not 5 stars??  Im always the designated driver, and when it comes to soda, they only serve Coke products.. ewwwww...   then again, Ive never heard of someone asking for a "Rum N Pepsi" before.  So yes.. 1 star is for my diet pepsi!!  :)

I came in today for the first time and spoke to a wonderful host.  I said I found this place on Yelp and she asked me to give a review, so here I am.  Thinking 11:15 would be ok for lunch time to beat the crowd, I could see the place was already packed.  I had to park a good distance down the street.  Keep in mind this place is not easy to find.  Once inside, I ordered for take out.  I got the turkey poblano melt with fries.  It was maybe 10min before my order was ready.  I grabbed it and headed back to the office.    One thing that made me real happy was that their fries were nicely seasoned and not too crunchy.  I ordered them based off the pics I've seen on help.  I ate my fries first (I'm weird that way) and then enjoyed the sandwich.  It was delicious!  So juicy with each bite and sadly I wolfed that thing down in a matter of minutes.  I am now stuffed... haha. So worth it.   I WILL be back!

Ive probably been to about five or size IHOPs, but I will say that this is my favorite one.   Why I gave it four out of five stars was because the wait.  Being so popular and good, there's always a line outside the place to get in.  I guess that's a good thing, right?  Once I was seated, the waitress was over to our table within the first minute.  She took our drink order and in another minute she was back and we had ordered our food.  One of the things I love about IHOP is that you get pancakes with almost every meal.  How could you go wrong there?  I got a ham and cheese omelet and personally I like to hit the pancakes first.  My God.. they were incredible.  So fluffy, hot, fresh.. with butter and syrup, those were gone in no time.  I moved onto my omelet where I discovered it loaded with a ton of cheese.  That might be gross to some, but this is was just delicious.    Our waitress was always on top of making sure we had drinks filled and needing other things.  Such a great experience. Love this place.

I love Peter Piper Pizza!  No, Im not some 10 year old kid who's a pizza fanatic and this is the best in town.  By all means this is not your gourmet pizza, but hey.. you get what you pay for and for experience, I love it.  I love the pizza here because it's simple crap pizza.. by crap pizza, I mean its fun, not fancy, and just basic thrown together sauce, cheese and toppings goodness.  I like their crust actually..  Weird I know..  I do wish their pizza's werent so much.  They used to be around $5.99 for a large pepperoni.  Prices seem to have gone up.  If you bring the kids, this location is a very cool place.  Tons of games and fun for the kids.  My friends daughter had lost her ticket coupon that showed she'd won 190 coupons.  They still gave her the gifts for it!  how cool is that?  My only complaint was the women handing out the pizzas got into a coughing fit as she was handling the pizzas.  Though she covered herself up, it still gave me the heebie geebies.    I'll come back here.  We all had a blast here.

Was here last night with the family.  Usually we get a big pizza, but we were all eating different and I got a couple slices and yumm..  When you order a slice, pizza places will usually have slice pies made ready to go and when you show up they throw it in the oven again.  I LOVE that extra crispness you get from the slices.  My girlfriend got their Eggplant Parmesan, but if you want to mix it up and have it really good; instead of your usual marinara sauce, have them mix it up with some Alfredo sauce.  The taste is insane.  Service was great as always.  I love it when the people interact and actually talk to you as a friend rather than just a customer.

I haven't been here in years but decided to visit again since a few weeks ago. This place is still awesome!  Our server James was great and the food came out pretty quick.  NYPD still has the best garlic cheese knots.  We live near the Scottsdale/Shea location, but this place is sooooo much better.  Keep it up guys!

What a cool place this is.  My girlfriend and I take her girls here to skate and I love just sitting back and watching the scenery.  Made me feel like I was in grade school again when we used to hit up Great Skate.  Each night they have different themes for skaters, so for example, I think on Monday you have Christian music night, Tuesday could be 80s night, rap night, etc.  Something for everyone.    For those not interested in skating they have a huge arcade and gaming area similar to Peter Piper.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the prices for snacks.  They have pizza, but get ready to spend $16 for a large cheese.  I know right?    Cool place to and bring the kids!

Great place and the people there know how to make your special drink.  What's awesome is that we go there so much that they know our name and drink.  That alone makes ya feel special.  The only thing that I hate about this location is they close at 7PM.. I know?!  Get there early in the morning!

Damn this place is yummy.  I just moved to Glendale and was happy to see there's a location over there.  So I will be going there a lot.  I've been tot his location twice with some friends and the service is incredible.  My girlfriend was a little hungover from the night before of a little partying and banana's are a great medicine for a hang over.  I called up Good Egg before we showed up to ask if they had fresh ones.. they did!!  We show up and I go in and they happily hand me one.  Aweee.. how awesome.  If you order their pancakes, keep in mind the size of these monsters.  You can get one, two or three.  Our friend's son can polish off the three stack like it's nothing.  I did two and barely finished it.  The food is delicious and the variety is huge. Omelets, pancakes, eggs, etc.   This place is great.

Ive been going here for years and I love it.  They have great food and pretty decent prices.    The wait is usually not bad if you go before the dinner rush.  They can usually seat you right away.  You get bread  with a nice olive oil herb dip to eat before dinner.  (Make sure you ask for fresh bread... if you go too early, they give you the lunch bread).  My favorite to eat there is the Pollo Rosa Maria.. two pieces of chicken breast stuffed with cheese, covered with mushrooms and with a nice side of fettuccine Alfredo.  Delicious.  My favorite thing of all here is their iced tea..  just plain iced tea.  Im not a fan of passion fruit or weird fruity mango teas, so this place fits it perfect.  The staff is friendly and the smells coming out are great!

Old Reliable...   That's what our family calls this place.   When we cant think of a new place to eat when we go our, or everyone is arguing about this place or that place, we always say "Ok, well lets go to Red Robin.."    Ive been here at least 20 times, and every time I go, it just gets tastier.  I mean, what place offers all-you-can-eat fries?  Steak fries!..  Funny though, even knowing I can have more than one basket, I get just one..   If you want good service, use Tim.  He rocks and is usually serving the tables in the middle or the booths just next to them.   What to get?  I love their Royal Red Robin burger.  Call me traditional, but how awesome is it that you have a hamburger with a fried egg on it?  Gross you say? Ohhh just the opposite, mouth watering delicious.    If you are in to wings, they have these amazing dry rub wings that just bite you back.  Id get a ton of them if they were cheaper..   Also if you love Root beer floats, get ready because for $3.00  you can get all-you-can-drink floats.  How cool is that?  I love their iced tea.  All I drink when I go out is iced tea and Red Robin has some of the best out there.  Ugg.. i feel like going there for lunch now .  Damn you Red Robin!!  Maybe this weekend!

What to write about an already popular restaurant.  Oh wait.. it's this exact location.  I love this location!  Maybe it's the people who work there, maybe it's the layout of the building, but I think it's just great.  For those who have never been to the Olive Garden (which I doubt is many), you have to make sure and ask them for FRESH bread sticks.  This last trip there they gave us what seemed to be the last of the lunch breadsticks.. yeah.  They quickly fixed it and gave us plenty of fresh ones.  I usually enjoy simple dishes, but decided to try one of their new specials.  Completely forgot the name of the dish, but there was chicken, pasta and some other goodies.  A big plus about Olive Garden is that every so often they have all you can eat pasta bowls. MMmmmm..   Great "Italian" food.. hehe.

It's funny to write a review about a store like this.  It's Bed Bath & Beyond..  how different is it from other locations? Not much.  The place always smells good, the staff is usually pleasant and if they dont have something you need, chances are another location will have it.  This location is a great one because it's near Borders and Toys R Us.  How cool is that?

This is a great place, but interesting at the same time.. why? Because it's across the street from a Fry's Marketplace.  I love this place because it's the Fry's when you need to run in and out in a hurry.    Today I went and all the cashiers were dressed up for Halloween.  Very cool.  Love the deals here and while this is not the fancy dancy Fry's Marketplace, they still have all the great deals.  But when I do my major grocery shopping.. I still go to the big one.. heh.

We usually visit this place about two to three times a year (various locations).  We really enjoy the food and the teppanyaki chefs are the best.  We've had Tim both times at this location and he's always been great.  The waitress was a bit slow this last time as nearly all 10 in our party had empty glasses and dishes were starting to pile up  I looked over and realized she was handling two other massive tables.  Always look forward to coming back here!

My girlfriend lives just a few blocks away from this place.  We eat here maybe 3-5 times a month.  Always great service and the food is a top notch.  If you've been to Zipps, well it's the same thing because Goldie's was the first!  You won't be disappointed.

I ate here and was in the bathroom three times.  Not a great experience.  I give it two stars because the servers are nice, but their food is just not good at all.    Their location on 16th St & Camelback has excellent queso dip.  We ordered it here and it felt like plastic.  The flavor was ok, but you had to keep stirring it so it would't congeal up.    Ordered their rolled taco plate.  When it came out the cheese wasn't melted on it, the rice was bland, beans were bland.  The meat on the inside was ok, but I couldn't finish it.    What happened Ajo?  YOu guys were once great.  Won't be coming back here again.

I think I've managed to hit all the Oregano's in town.  This was my last one and as always, it was a pleasant visit.  Went with my girlfriend and her son and ordered wings, the blackened pasta and a pizza.    Service was great and prompt and after we were all stuffed, the waitress asked us if we wanted to put a pizza cookie in .. .Yes please!!  Even if you are stuffed beyond anything, you MUST order one.  The three of us polished it off in no time flat.

What happened to this place?    I remember coming her when it opened many years ago and even as an adult the place was jaw dropping.  Remember that game that took you up a few stories into the air?  I remember GameWorks having the top of the line of any video game out there.  On the bottom floor, you could play anything that was new to the industry and on the second floor, you could play the vintage games like Frogger and Pacman.  I get that the arcade industry has changed, but I guess I had no idea how much..  I was just here last night while waiting to see a movie and when I walked in, it felt as if I stepped into Peter Piper Pizza.  Tons of skiball, basketball, dance dance revolution, karaoke, guitar hero.. They had some of the old games there, but it just looked like GameWorks jumped the shark and was trying to now be a place where you could play console games.    I just wasn't impressed...  Also the food there isnt the greatest.

Came here for a friends going away party this past weekend.  A little tough to find because the address is also in Mesa and Phoenix.. so make sure you know where you're going.   We had a party on the patio along with another large party.  It was amazing.  I've never been here, so for a place that's a bar and grill.. they had some of the tastiest bar food I have ever had.     The service was great and we were never left unattended.  My girlfriend is allergic to cilantro so when she asked for certain foods, the girl there took great care of us.    We would definitely be back even though it's across town.  Just a cool place.

Ive been to Coco's before and probably a few of them.  Even this one a while back.  However, Ive been to this location twice in two weeks and have never been happier.    BE sure to get Amanda as your server. She's awesome and knows her stuff.  The second time we all showed up, she literally pointed at each of us and told us our drink order.. we never said a word.  It was awesome.  Right now Coco's is doing their holiday food so dont miss out on the great tastes they have going on.  My personal favorite at Coco's is their Turkey Jack Croissant.  I get it all the time and I'm never disappointed.    Best time to is during the week in the evenings. They gave great breakfasts, so you can also order that in the evening time.  If you go on a Sat or Sun morning... get ready to wait.  The place is packed!

I remember going to the old version of this Target when I was a kid.  They have since knocked it down along with Service Merchandise and built a colossal mega Target.  Very cool place.  Guess what's inside it? Starbucks.. heh.. That alone makes it better than most Targets.  Cool people, helpful staff, so this place is rockin for what you need.

Ok, Im 5 starring this solely for the chili dogs.  I seriously could eat a dozen of these and not think twice. Ive been here about five times and usually get the chili dogs.  Of course when Im eating them Im always wondering if my stomach will kick my ass later on.  Thankfully it enjoys them as much as I do.  They have some new Chicago dogs, which are probably good, but been too busy with their Chili dogs.   Heads up.. No these aren't gourmet chili dogs that you get at some fancy place, they are small sloppy, messy, fast chili dogs.. I love them

Burrito Bowl..  Mmmmm...  I discovered burrito bowls after always feeling like a bloated whale eating their whole burrito's.  I'm far from complaining because they were so damn good.  But I like to enjoy life after eating Mexican food.   This location is always busy, but they seem to keep the line moving very quickly.  Also sometimes it's nice cause I'll add an extra item and occasionally they wont charge me.. (thx!).   The people are nice and always smile.  That's pretty important.  Even if you're having a  bad day it's nice to smile because we definitely return the favor.  (mainly speaking of the girl at the register and the a couple of their line people).  I love this place and usually frequent it at least once a week.  Good food and good people!!

We decided to go here instead of eating out.  We walked in and placed our orders of what we wanted.  I said the house special chicken meal and she ordered the orange chicken meal.  We were pretty specific with what we wanted.  A few times he asked us, but we kept explaining to make sure he got it right...  After paying $40 for the food and walking out, we headed home and opened the food to see that all the orders were wrong.  No house special chicken at all. and the orange chicken could serve a small child only.  Pretty unhappy, we called and they guy on the phone said we didn't order the meals, but only the individual servings.  Are you kidding??   I didn't think this was Panda Express.  They delivered and while we wanted them to do that, I decided I just didn't want to deal with them again.  The food we did eat was ok.. nothing amazing.

I've been a big fan of Einsteins for a long time.  This is my first time at this location.  I always order a peanut butter schmear bagel, twice toasted.  Usually the places never understand what that means, and it's never right.  They got it right.  I ordered my bagal and literally watched her toast my bagel twice.  Mind you, she had about 10 other orders going on, but I saw her do it.  I was a happy camper.  That alone made this trip worth the 4 stars.  Why not 5?  Because holy crap, this place is busy on a weekend morning.  From walking in til I got my bagal, it was a good 15minutes.  Good thing the food is good.  if I could recommend one thing to them. Please empty your trash cans outside. People couldn't throw anything away because they were overflowing...

This will be a weird review.  At 11PM Monday night, I awoke with a stabbing pain in my side and knowing the pain before I knew it was the almighty kidney stone.  I had one about 10 years ago so I knew the pain.  I took a shower hoping to relieve the pain, but this time it was a bit worse.  After getting out of the shower, I got dressed and headed to the ER.  It was about 11:30PM.  I dont know.. but for some reason, im thinking "Oh it's 11:30PM, there shouldnt be many in the waiting room..." WRONG.  You would have thought this was Denny's at 3AM.   I counted about 25 in the room.  With half of them being patients.  I checked in and waited.  That's when the pain just started going full force.  There's nothing I could do but grab my stomach and cringe. I was in so much pain, tears were streaming down my face, Im making weird noises I usually dont make and i was just a mess.  I stand up and ask the girl at the desk if there's anyway I can be seen quicker.  A nurse comes out and starts to apologize for the wait and tells me there are others in just as much pain.  I look around and back to her and say "Are you kidding??  They are just sitting and starring at the wall...Im dying here!"    She apologizes again.  Two hours go by.. I have a CT scan done to confirm a kidney stone..  IM still in pain.  Agonizing pain to be honest.  After going back to sit, I find myself in a spot where Im not in pain. I sit there and think "Did I pass it??"  I was no longer in pain.. I was no among the people starring at the wall blankly.    The nurse finally called me in and moved me to a room.  I was checked out and then sent over to another waiting room area.   This is where it gets good.. The nurse staff and doctors were nothing but awesome and kind.  Anything I needed they took care of.  Seeing that I would likely be here all night, they wanted to make my stay a good one.  So while it sucked to be in pain, the staff at BTSMC was great.

I really enjoy Village Inn and being back in Glendale, it's nice to have one near me.  And by near me, I mean about two blocks down the road.  This location was the same one I had my graduation dinner after high school.. yeah I know.  big spender.  We decided to go for breakfast on Sunday morning.  Showed up and as expected there was a large crowd.  Mostly older people and a few young families.  This place is kinda cool cause you can see that the staff has worked there for many years.. kinda reminded me of the old Smitty's restaurants.  Remember those?  What i ordered for breakfast was an iced tea and an omelet with a side of cakes.  I decided on the California omelet.  I really didn't like it.  not because the eggs were bad or anything was not cooked or anything.  It had onions and I'm a huge onion hater. By onion, i mean the large slab slices.. not sauteed or anything.  Along that was cooked spinach.  Yeck.     Doesn't change me eating there.  This place is still great, I just will get something else next time. :)

If i have to choose between this location and the one on 43rd Ave. It has to be this one..    Why?  Because here, they get your drink out in literally 2min or less.  Im not dogging the other location because they do great on the drinks, but my God.. you can spend 20min in the drive-thru at times.   If you want fast, friendly and awesome service, this place kicks all kinds of ass. :)

Like Red Robin, Carraba's is my go-to Italian joint that I know I wont be disappointed in.    I love their bread and the yummy oil/herbs that go with it.  I do ask for butter as well, but they always seem to bring out this frozen ball of butter.  I don't get that.  The best dish they have is their Pollo Rosa Maria.  It consists of two chicken breasts, stuff with fontina cheese and covered with a huge helping of sauteed mushrooms.  Make sure to get it with fettuccine alfredo.  It's a must!... if you don't like pasta, I dont know what to tel ya.  The combo of the two is a match made in heaven.  They have great salads and their own special house dressing.  Heads up on your ranch lovers.  they do not have ranch dressing.  As for their deserts, Im not much of a fan until they have their quarterly creme brulet.  Good food!

Im a big sushi fan and this past Wed we had to find a place to eat, our friend recommended Tokyo Lobby.   I've driven past it before, but never thought to eat.  The back of the building faces Bell Rd., so you dont actually see anything but the name.  When walking inside, it has the decor and feel like a small well lit sushi bar. They have a patio outside that is covered for small parties and people to hang out at.  Inside they have about 10 or so tables.  Plenty of room for anyone.  We ordered our drinks and some edemame and then it was time to order the sushi..  We tried some of the signature rolls like "Orgasm" and "Monkeybrains."  Let me tell you... some of the best sushi I have had.  The Orgasm was so unusual, but delicious.  It had a sweet crunch to it and then just melted in your mouth.  I know that can sound a bit much.. but it was amazing.  For three people.. we ordered six rolls..Yes.. 6.   When I was done, I was literally thinking "Umm. more please?"  I can't wait to go back!  The service was awesome, the food was great and I had no clue this place was this good!

The Ajo Al's on 16th St has always been my home for good mexican food.  Until this place.. HOLY...  I love this place.  First off, the actual building is incredible.  Kudos to whomever designed this place.  It looks awesome.    Their chips are great along with the delicious salsa and hot sauce.  My only complaint is the last time I went , the chips were old tasting.. I could tell they gave me the bottom of the chip drawer.   I  love this place and will be coming back often!

Im giving this 5 stars because at this location and at the time we went, it was great.  Amber I believe was our waitress and she couldn't have been more welcoming.  We went for an early lunch on a Sunday and it was only three of us.    My girlfriend and I split their Kobe beef burger and while she likes the burgers near mooing.. Im more of a medium person.  She won, and the burger was mooing.  Let me tell you though.. it was delicious!  Their fries were good and crunchy and before hand we all had Caesar salads that just fit perfect.  Loved this place and we're thinking of making it a regular for weekend lunches!

Welcome to my new home since I don't live in Chandler anymore..  I love Harkins Theaters and now that they're cheaper than AMC (if you go in the evenings), this is my choice.  Seriously, my ideal theater is AMC experience with Harkins seats.  Strange huh?  Funny that the only theater that does that is the AMC westgate.. but I'll review that later.    What I love about this place is the location.  My God that's so important.  I dont have to drive around a damn mall just go to to the movies.. I can go to 83rd Ave and boom.. it's right there.  Plus the fact that it's around a ton of restaurants.  Makes for a great evening out.    The people at Harkins have always been great to work with.  Being involved with the Phoenix Film Foundation, Harkins is one of the partners, so it's been a long great relationship with them.  I hope they keep opening more theaters in great locations.  Hmm.. maybe we have that covered.    I think may see that new Nic Cage movie this weekend..

A few of us checked out this place last week.  Ive always driven by it, but finally stopped in.  Damn what a great idea...   The place is divided into a few sections.. the bar/tavern/sports bar-ish area and then the dining area.  We all sat in the dining room.  There was no waiting because you can sit where you want.  The food was delicious.  They happened to have a fish fry that night and I happily enjoyed it.  It was happy hour, so we got some good deal on appetizers and drinks.  The menu was huge, so you could pick from a  huge assortment of foods.  The only thing I did question was the four hostesses standing in the front.. one was nice enough to tell us where we could sit and the others just stood there chatting with each other.    Will I be back? Oh yeah.  Loved it

Ive been waiting to write this for a week or so...Id give it 1.5 stars, but they dont have those here on Yelp.  I used to love going to Sweet Tomatoes.  I called it the great upgrade from Souper Salad.   And for a long time it was.. and in some cases, still us.  But let me ask you something.. Why would call yourselves Sweet Tomatoes if you literally had no tomatoes?  We decided to hit this place up because we were trying to eat "healthier."  I know funny, huh?  One could still eat like crap at Sweet Tomatoes.   So get my plate and begin my salad creation.. romaine lettuce,, mixed with some ceasar and that's when I noticed things missing.  No tomatoes, No cucumbers, No egg..  uhh hello??  These are what makes muy salad good.  So here I am left to enjoy a lettuce and blue cheese salad?  Horrible.  They said they'd give us a  break of $2  of our bill.. Oh thank you very much for your hospitality. we came to enjoy good food, but you didn't have any.    My final dinner was a small dish of OK pasta along with a half plate of lettuce and blue cheese.  That was sooo worth $10.  (sarcasm).    My last few trips to Sweet Tomatoes have not been great, so next time someone suggests this for dinner, I'll kindly reply with: "You have a good time, I'll make me a PB&J for dinner."     I hope there's another Souper Salad/Sweet Tomatoes type place out there that would like to open a few locations in Arizona and show these guys how it's really done.

The food always seems to get better with each trip.  Of course when I leave Im stuffed and feel like Im going to explode.  That's my own fault..  I like this location.  We are always seated pretty quickly.  If we have to wait it's maybe 10min average.  Not too bad at all. Service has always been great here.  If you ask for extra's they bring it and never say anything.   When it comes to the food, Cheesecake has pretty much anything you could imagine.  Breakfast burrito? they have it.. Chinese food? they have it..  You name it, they have it.  I found that sometimes, you can order an appetizer and it's the size of a regular meal.  I love their buffalo blast chicken appetizers.  it's a ton of food and it will fill you up with no problems.  the one thing Ive never had luck with is their club sandwich.  Always been dry for me.    And now we talk about the cheesecake itself.  The pieces are huge and super rich. I recommend splitting it with someone.  They are great though.

This is why this location is awesome..  Being from Phoenix and only walking in here once, they had what we needed and were in there for maybe 10min max.    But why 5 stars?  They had Safety Dance playing over the speakers!!  Along with myself and my girlfriend, I saw at least four other people nearly dancing while shopping.  How awesome is that?  Friendly staff and very helpful for what we needed too!

The fun shop of all fun shops.   I've known about this place for years, but it wasnt until about 10 years ago that I finally walked in.  What a great place.  If there's something you need for a party or my favorite, Halloween.. Easley's has you covered.    This last year I turned my girlfriends little girls into zombies (per their request!) and I went to Easley's to ask for the Death Wheel make-up by Ben Nye.  Being a popular kit, I guess I expected them to not have it.  Not only DID they have it, but the girl actually gave me some tips on applying make up and some cool techniques.    You can easily get lost in this place (in a good way!) and spend tons of dough..  I know I did.    The place just rocks.

Ive been here three times.. and I think I can finally make an honest review.    I don't care what pizza you've had, or what sandwich you've eaten, or what wing you've devoured.  You MUST try Pullano's.  For years my favorite NY style pizza has been NYPD Pizza (valley-wide).  Well NYPD... you've been dethroned!.   I just moved from Chandler to Glendale and happen to live about a block away from this haven.  As we all moved in to the new place, we ordered Pullano's to go.  We got three pizzas and 40 wings.  Let me tell ya.. if it weren't for the people around me, I could have eaten 24 wings by myself and the a few slices of pizza.  But damn.. i had to share.  I had one slice of the delicious meat lovers pizza and about 6 wings.  It reminded me of the first time I've ever eaten a good slice of pizza and wings.    We went last night for their $5 large cheese pizza night (Wed) and being new to this place, I had no idea why it was so packed (duh), til I saw the special.  We waited for about 10min and were seated.  Jessica was our server and took awesome care of us.  I love it when the servers become your friends and make sure you have the greatest time. Jessica was awesome.  Also being Christmas time, someone was passing around cheese balls. I want to say it was the owner? (because he looks like the owner).  Yum!  We had a great experience, and Im happy to say I found a new favorite pizza place.  Thank you Pullano's!!

Anyone remember Valley West Mall on 50th Ave & Northern right before it closed?    That's what Chris-town Spectrum Mall feels like..    My aunt worked here when I was a kid and that was back in the 80s when the mall was thriving with business and there were always a ton of great people walking around.  The food court  wasn't there just yet, but when that opened it gave it an even greater feel.    but now..  Chris-Town... or face it.. lets just call it Spectrum Mall, is nothing but a ghetto run down store with a bunch of jewelry and urban clothing stores.  I'm shocked that they even have a nail shop inside... I dont mean an upper class one, I mean the ones you see in a strip mall.  The only stores that are recognizable are GNC, Bath & Body Works and shockingly... Wing Stop.. why the hell would they put a Wing Stop in there? wow..  Big 5 Sports is pretty decent I guess too..  I give this two stars because what was once a great mall is now nothing.  In my honest opinion, they should shut down the remaining mall section and just rebuild it as more big stores..  The only reason people go here now is Harkins, Wal-Mart, Target and JC Penny's..  oh and Costco.   think about it... What mall has all those outside stores attached to them?  None that I can think of.. unless they're hurting.  RIP Chris-Town

I've been to another First Watch location that I really was not a fan of.  This location changed my mind.  Met my parents here for a late lunch. We just missed the lunch crowd and we seated right away.  My mother likes privacy so she asked if we could sit far back in the restaurant; they were very kind and seated us in the back.    Being on a new diet, I wanted to see if I can do some protein style breakfast/lunch that wasn't too bad.  I couldn't believe all the choices I had to order from.  I got a chorizo/avocado omelette that was just outstanding.  Both my parents love their food and to top it off, we had a great server!

I generally am a fan of all IHOPs.  I give this one 4 stars because while it is a dive location, at 3AM they busted out some great fresh food that we all enjoyed.  Yes we were out at a party so you probably think that any food would be good.  Not always the case.   Im a big breakfast lover and their pancakes are always amazing.  Service was quick and great.  Id go here again!

I love this place.  They have anything and everything you can think of.  One thing I do like especially is the massive horror dvd section they have.  Try walking into Best Buy and look at their tiny little two shelves of horror dvds.. Pathetic.  The staff and Zia's is always helpful with anything you need.  And if there's a movie or cd, or anything you need.. call them up and generally they will carry it and hold it for you.  Zia's is the best shop around!

My girlfriend and I came here for a 50th wedding anniversary party last night and upon entering the place reminds me of a small family pizzeria.  It's in an older part of town right next to a auto store.  When we walked in, they pointed us to the area where the party was.  It was a long hall-way and opened up into this huge room!  From the front of the restaurant you wouldnt think it was there.  By the way, the place was packed.  Service was great with drinks and  since it was a big party, they had two choices of food: lasagna and chicken alfredo, along with some garlic bread and salad.  The salad was just a basic garden salad, but the ingridents were fresh and it was deliscious!  I opted to have both the chicken alfredo and the lasagna and I wasnt sorry one bit.  It was the most delicious tasting italian food I think I have ever eaten at a restaurant.    My girlfriend lookd over and said to me.. "I could eat 4 more plates, but Im so stuffed"  I replied "I would love to get sick here"  It was THAT good.  I highly recommend this food and even though we live in Scottsdale, we WILL be back.  Incredible service and food!

I think I just found the best sub shop in town.    Captain Bill's has been around forever.  I even remember this place as a kid, though I never went here.  No idea why.    The place is a very small subshop that houses about six or so small tables and covered wall to wall are pictures of people who have been there from way back in the early 80s.  I recognized many people from the pics and it was a pretty cool idea.  I ordered myself a salami, pepperoni and cheese sub (baked) along with some italian dressing.  I thought "Well I'll get an 8" because the full is just too big."  I destroyed that thing in a matter of a few minutes.  I could have easily done a 10" sub.  The bread was so soft and crunchy in just the right toasted way.  The meat and veggies inside were just perfect and the italian dressing made it a sweet finish.  I can't wait to go back!  This place is the best!

What happened to this place?  I know it's been years since I've been here, but last I remember Sizzler was pretty much on par with Black Angus or close to it.  I know Sizzlers in California that are pretty decent.  This place.. wow.   My aunt and I had dinner here a few weeks ago.  When I first walked in, I was hit with that bathroom smell.  Mind you the bathrooms are right next to where you order.  Not a good placement. We opted for the salad bar and that's when I looked over at their "buffet" and it looked like nobody had cleaned it for half a day.  The food looked old, the lettuce wilted, it just looked gross.  After getting a few wings (plain because their buffalo sauce looked nasty), we sat down.   I had ordered a diet pepsi and a basket of bread.  The bread wasnt too bad.   Oh another note on the smells.. when we were walking from our table to the salad bar, it smelled like someone just urinated right on the carpet.   I said out loud "why does it smell like piss in here?"  Yes, hoping someone would hear me.  Nobody cared.  The service was ok and that's why it has 2 stars instead of 1.  Honestly, Sizzler looks like it's nearing the end of its run in Arizona.  There are three left and I believe this is the worst of them.   Some advice..  Fix this place up or do what Swensen's did and close the doors.

Awesome place.  I moved to the west side and needed a place to work and seeing that this is literally a mile and a half down the road, it works for me.  Cool staff and always tons of equipment open to use.  I only wish they had a basketball courts like LA Fitness does.. I like to shoot hoops every now and then.    Cool thing though.. Since LA Fitness bought all the Pure Fitness' in Phoenix.. it means I can use my membership at LA Fitness.  Problem solved. yeah!  Good place and good workouts!

I ate here three times in a week...  That's how much I love this place.  I get the regular gyro, and I cant tell you enough how delicious the food is here.   It's a small little shop across the parking lot from Pure Fitness.  If you dont look for it, you can miss it.    I havent tried other foods, but what i have eaten, has been amazing.  Im sure I will go here again this week and look forward to maybe something new.

I guess I was the fourth person to make the mistake of getting this confused with the Abacus Inn on 48th St & Elliot.  No big deal, glad I tried a new place.  We ordered your usual type of chinese foods.. mongolian beef, chicken chow mein, some soup, etc.   Felt bad because when the waiter was walking our food to the table he somehow slipped and the entire tray of food tumbled to the ground and he burnt himself in the process.  He apologized at least a dozen times, in which we were just making sure he was ok.  They cleaned up the mess and we enjoyed a very delicious, stuffing meal.   I'll be back!

I found this place via Yelp because we needed a place to meet some friends in downtown Chandler.  This was the winner.  Though a bit pricey for the average person, the food definitely made up and was delicious!  I ordered the lasagna.  it came out piping hot in a dish and was incredible. Probably the best Ive had outside of home made.  A buddy of mine ordered the pizza and it too was great.    i wasn't a fan of their bread so much that they give out before hand.  But it's always nice to have something before the main course.  I will definitely go here again!

Pretty good place for ice cream.  We hit this place up after we ate a delicious meal at Grimaldi's (review coming soon).  I split a banana split with my girlfriends daughter and we pretty much plowed through it.  It was yum.  There's not much to this place, but it has a cool 50s diner feel to it and there is a game room.  It was pretty damn cold, so bring a jacket.  Good times!

Dr K is the best!  I was referred by my girlfriend and her family when I was looking for a new dentist.  I have heard great things about Dr K so decided it was time to give him a try.   The place was hard to find at first because the entrance was on the back of the building, but once there it's easy.    Dr K is very informative of your treatment and will talk you through the entire process.  You also get to wear some cool Elvis glasses so you don't get stuff on your face or to limit the shine in your eyes.  He has a great staff who calls and checks in to make sure your visit went well.   I'm glad I found myself a new dentist and have already referred him to a few friends of mine.

Only 5 stars??  That's crap.  I wish they had a 10 stars because Grimadi's would easily get that.  Some may not agree with me and there was a point in my life when I thought differently.  A few years ago I had dinner at the Chandler location for the first time.  Yeah it was good, but it was your normal fancy pizza that I figured most trendy places are doing.  I don't know what changed from then until now.  I visited this location and we had a party of about eight people.  We all showed up and went to our table. Ordered drinks and quickly ordered the pizzas.  My girlfriend ordered us a pesto pizza with olives and mushrooms.  Others ordered various ones and when they brought them out, we went to town.  For years I've been a pizza lover and some of my favorite pizza places are even on here, but I gotta say that Grimaldi's is now my favorite pizza place I have ever been to.  I took a bite of that pesto pizza and almost fell off my chair.  I couldn't believe how good it was.  People make jokes at me sometimes because I get rediculous when it comes to good food.  Well, its because I love dining out and when the food and service is great, I get a little extra excited.  I also tried some of their sausage with cheese and couldn't seem to say no to more.  Quick note about their pizza.. it is THIN crust pizza.  Think Oregano's and NYPD Pizza had a kid and that kid became President.  That's Grimaldi's (at least in my book).  I had 4.5 slices..  yea yeah yeah.. but it was soooo good.  I even told our server "dude, this is the best pizza I have ever eaten."  he patted me on the back and said "Awe yeah, that's what we love to hear."  I can't wait to go back here again.    Thank you for an awesome time Grimaldi's!

Im giving this place two stars because I love the first location at 20th St & Highland.  That place was always great.  This place was pretty bad.. at least on this visit.   We arrived to eat to see a packed parking lot. Many people were eating at Oregano's and we've always enjoyed NYPD.  As we walked in, we were seating pretty quickly.  Always a nice thing.  Nice waitress came over, took our drink orders and we also ordered an appetizer and a salad.  Within 5min, both were out and we placed our pizza order.    In came more people to eat and we realized we were going to be waiting a long time.  The table next to us  who was seating long after us asked "I wonder what's taking so long?"  That's when my girlfriend informed me that we've been sitting here for nearly an hour before our pizza showed up.  I learned they were short staffed, but it would be nice to let your customers know that.    When the pizza finally came out, it was over cooked and wasnt great.  Ive always raved about NYPD having the best pizza in town.  Today (at least at this location), I was wrong.  It was far from it.

I have yet to eat a bad meal here.  The food is great, the wings... get the Italian Gold. Sweet and so delicious.  Usually when we go, we get a 16" pie with a few toppings.  3-4 people can easily polish one these off.  Lately though we've tried their calzone, and damn is that thing big.  Filled inside with tons of great ingredients, comes out piping hot and a taste that will last for a life time.  If you still have room for dessert, I highly recommend their pizza cookie. Once you eat that, there's no going back.  You'll drown yourself in a chocolate paradise.  I love this place!  The ONLY draw back (but still gave it 5 stars) is that if you dont get their early, get ready to wait for at least 30-40 minutes to be seated.

If you ever imaged a Starbucks that smelled of sweat socks mixed with caramel and coffee, you've come to the right place..  The Starbucks on Mill is easily the smelliest Starbucks in town.  The coffee is still decent because its a Starbucks, but the place just is not great.  I do enjoy the couches when people aren't living on them for 8 hours at a time.  The place is usually packed with people using laptops for the free wifi, and the smell comes from the people off the streets walking in and out of the place.  Dont forget.. t his is Mill Ave.. so all walks of life come here.  Enjoy!

Uhh... Trails? What happened?  I remember trails being this kick ass rock store that carried posters, cool rock shirts and anything that basically kicked ass.  Sure they had their pipes inside a cabinet.. but it seems Trails is now 90% pipes and 10% anything else you could think of.

So Im a fan of the show.  Isnt that why most people write reviews for this place?  We walked up after parking and were in line to get in behind about 30 people.  Our friend was anxious and didnt want to wait, but I told her the line moves pretty fast.  ...and it did.  In 5min we were already walking in the place.  When you get inside, it looks like.. wait for it.. a pawn shop.  Shocking huh?  You definitely recognize some of the areas from the show.  The big painting on the wall of Jimmy Hendrix.  A lot of their items were pretty awesome and rare.  I guess that's what impressed me most about the place.  They had the good stuff.  If you wanted swag from Pawn Stars, they had plenty of it.. shirts, mugs, shot glasses, posters, anything.. it was all in the middle.  The staff was more than great there, but of course you didnt see anyone from the show around.  I figure they film during the week and close the place off.  Pretty cool place and Im glad I finally got to check it out.

We come here on an average once a week and always leave feeling wonderful.  The food is great.  I think one of my favorite things here is that along with the salsa they also bring out hot sauce for the chips. Sometimes they forget, but you can ask for it.  It's the tastiest stuff. Cant get enough.  My girlfriend and I usually do the baja chicken burro but have also recently got the mini chicken chimis.  holy deliciousness batman!

This is a sweet new location. They moved from the 19th Ave & Indian School to camelback. The really cool thing is it's right next to the light rail.  The store is an old CVS store, so it's super bright inside with all the cool signs and a massive vinyl section.   I dont think ive ever seen a larger vinyl area in a local store (unless you're vinyl only)  Cool people and super awesome staff. Highly recommend!

Ya know what? I always thought i wouldnt stay here because it was one of the older hotels.  Call me a snob, right?  But I stayed here and absolutely loved it.  The rooms were clean and the beds were amazing.  The staff was always friendly and willing to help with anything you needed.  The only thing I wasnt a fan of was that besides Mystere there wasnt much to do in TI.  No clubs, the restaurants were ok, and the bars were eh.   My stars are based on the hotel itself and the room.  I would definitely stay here again.  Affordable too!!

My girlfriends aunt lives in Henderson and this place is about 5min from her house.   When she told us, "im going to take you guys to this great breakfast buffet," I automatically lit up.. I love breakfast and I love buffets.    We go this pretty large casino/resort (small compared to the ones on the strip) and head into the buffet area.      $4.99 for breakfast... that's cheaper than Denny's or IHOP.    I could not believe the variety of foods they had to choose from.  Usually Im used to seeing maybe 5 or 6 different items like pancakes, eggs, omelets, waffles and hash browns.  not here.  Basically if you can think of a breakfast item, they had it.    I filled my plate up with sausage/scrambled eggs, a cheese blintz, chicken fried streak, sausage, English muffin and a few other items.  After just one plate of food (and I didn't pig out, so don't freak out), I was stuffed, but so pleasantly stuffed.  The food was delicious!!  I guess not all good food is on the strip (that was sarcasm).  I loved this place and I cant wait to go back next time.  Heck for $4.99? Who could beat that?

BBQ is bar far my favorite food.  I just cant say no when Im around it.  Famous Dave's is the best in the valley.  Since Arizona is not your BBQ state, there's not much to choose from here, but this rocks.  Famous Daves has won many awards for their famous St. Louis style ribs, and something I eat everytime I am there.  They have amazing sides and the BEST corn bread I have ever eaten.  The best time to go is right around 5PM.  That seems to be when they bring out their freshest and new food for the dinner crowds.    I love this place and its right next to me, so when I get the BBQ hunger, I'll head to Daves.

It's been a while since I have been here.  I've been craving Famous Dave's for a while.  We just were here yesterday and I ordered my usual St. Louis 6 ribs with a salad and broccoli.  The salad and broccoli were fine, but the ribs...  What happened?  The were tiny and overcooked.  Out of the 6, I think one was pretty good at best.  The rest were tough and when I'd take a bite, it was like I was biting into leather.   You've lost me Famous Dave's.  I'll be sticking to the local BBQ now.

Can't say a ton about this because I was in and out in a flash, but I picked up some buns and a mix of the stuff I cant recall the name.. lol.  It was incredible!!  .. I also work across the street , so it's easy to go to.  :)

Ive reviewed the location in Chandler and this one feels the exact same. Love love love Famous Dave's.  Im not a big fan of their sides, but their corn, corn bread and ribs are the best Ive ever had.  In fact, I think Id rather replace two sides with two more ears of corn.. lol.  Wonder if I can do that.  Great service and we were seated quickly :)

Like Mexican food I've always found it impossible to find my favorite Italian restaurant..  Well look no further because I found my favorite Italian place in the valley.  Funny that I live on the west side and had no idea this place existed. It's just north of Bell of 459th Ave.  Easy to miss if you're not looking for it.   Right as you walk inside it has that family Italian feel to it.  Awesome decor all around.  A bar on the right as you walk in and then the rest of the restaurant is on the inside.  Ive been here a few times and I'll tell what I've had.  The first time I had their baked spaghetti and wow.. it was tasty!  Every bite better than the next.  They also bring out fresh bread for dipping in oil and balsamic vinagar.  Makes it that much better.  My favorite dish so far..  Eggplant Parmesan. Holy..  this dish was insane.  Im not even an eggplant fan and I couldnt get enough.  the meal is definitely big enough to split for two.  however they do offer a single portion.  I highly recommend this delicious place!

I like this place.. if you ever want to feel healthy.. just walk inside this.  It feels healthy, it smells healthy and you couldnt eat bad here if you tried.  Well maybe if you drank 50 shakes, but you get the idea.  I like those peanut butter and banana shakes for a meal replacement after a work out and the few times I've been here that's what I got.  And damn they are yummy and refreshing.    Sometimes a nice shake is more refreshing than a ton of food.  Plus it feels healthy too.. (depending on the shake).  Staff is cool and the place is ridiculously clean.  Plus it's close to work!

I always am on the look out for some great Mexican food and honestly, I dont find many places that would "wow" me.    My find is over..  My girlfriend suggested we go here after going through a list of 5 or so places.  She wanted Mexican, but we wanted to change from the usual places.  Valle Luna came up and we hurried over.  We walked in to find a slew of people waiting to be seated.  They said it would be about a 20min wait.  Not too bad. My girlfriend asked if they had any spots in the bar and we headed that way.  it felt like a Mexican sports bar!  ...the bar side did.  We found a nice booth with a few TV's around and within a few minutes, a waitress came over to take our order.    Im huge on chips n salsa and one thing I love is when they bring out hot sauce along with the salsa.  If hot sauce is there, I rarely touch the salsa.  They had it!!  I love and hate chips at the same time.  You can easily fill up on chips before your main dish comes out.  I tried to stop, but I just keep snacking.. Yummm.!  I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga and when they brought it out, it looked and smelled amazing.  Covered with sour cream, lettuce and a side of re-fried beans and Spanish rice.  I went to town.  It was one of the best chimichangas Ive had.   I found my mexican restaurant!!  We came back later in the week for lunch..  loved it again!

I remember Metrocenter when it was THE place to go on a weekend.  I would go with my friends, catch a movie (before Harkins was there) at the United Artists or AMC outisde the mall.  This whole area had just so much stuff to do and shop.    Remember when they filled Bill & Teds at the mall? Watch the movie to give you an idea of how huge and thriving the mall once was.  I drove by there the other day and it seems the only thing thriving is the one small strip of newer shops facing Peoria.  Starbucks, Fatburger, etc.  That's it.  Even the Barns N Noble near Olive Garden looks like its ready to close down.  I literally drive around the entire mall and that's when I noticed that almost the entire parking lot was empty except for what was in front near the theater.    Im hearing rumors that they want to turn the mall into charter schools and businesses.   Yeah.. that sounds like giving up to me.  Why not bulldoze the place down and create a new place like Desert Ridge or Tempe Marketplace?   Ghettocenter, Castles & Crap...  Get rid of it.  The whole area is just bad and needs to be demolished.   RIP Metrocenter (cira 1973-1995)

I love the food here.  I first had their food when I was in Las Vegas (i know.. not in LA) and the place was jam packed with people.  I think what makes this place so great is how simple it is.  Burgers and Fries.. that's it!    In-N-Out has the best fries out there.  Super fresh every time you order.  I mean dont get me wrong.. i love a good McDOnalds fry every now and then, but if you want fresh, this is the place.  Ive never actually been inside this one, but always do drive-thru

Let me tell you why Einstein inside the Hyatt is awesome.  During this years Phoenix Comicon we've been looking for places for breakfast and had no idea this was even inside the hotel.  We usually opted for Starbucks across the street.    Einsteins really stepped up to the plate though.  During the day they usually closed at 2 or 3PM, but with comicon being in town they extended their hours til 8PM.  That's customer service for ya!  I complimented them for doing that and the staff couldn't have been more nice and excited to be a part of the event that weekend.  I give them 5 stars because their food is always awesome and their staff was just as great!

This place was a rare find!  Yes it's been there for a while, but I never see it when hitting the Harkins for some R & R.  My girlfriend and I were looking to have sushi at that place down the parking lot, but they weren't open yet. So we said "hey let's try this place" and walked into WCG.  First thoughts.. "ok this looks kinda nice and fancy"   The hostess was really nice and sat us quickly.  The waiter came over and got us drinks pretty fast and was also really nice and helpful.   Looking over the menu I wanted something light but also something that i was familiar with, so I went with a simple club sandwich.    Let me tell you history with club sandwiches for a moment. Every time I have one at other places, they are always the same.  One sandwich, cut into different triangles, stacked 5" tall with a tooth pic in each slice.  That's fine.  Many places are also dry.  How does WCG do it?  They use one whole sandwich, stack it high with FRESH ingredients, slice it ONCE in half and it also comes with a nice side sauce (forgot the kind).  I also got a side of fries with it. I don't think in the history of having club sandwiches, have I ever verbally made a noise when eating a sandwich.  My girlfriend even commented to me "Enjoying your food?"    It was THE best club I've had.    She got a spicy chicken sandwich that she really enjoyed too!    Then we actually got dessert.  We had their cheesecake and it was the best we've had.  Yes.. better than Cheesecake Factory.  We've been here twice now and it's now a favorite of ours.

It's always a great day when one finds yet another awesome sushi restaurant.   Some friends of ours were throwing an engagement party with reservations at 8:30.  My girlfriend and I showed up about 7:45.. a bit early of course.  We had no idea how fast traffic would be from the west side.  The table was already set to go, but we decided to sit at the bar.  While at the bar there was a customer eating a delicious looking egg roll.  When we asked, he said "you've got try this.. it's a pork egg roll." So we ordered one.  Both my girlfriend and I agreed this is the best egg roll we have ever had.  It was amazing. She also ordered one of their signature martinis.  The staff here was just incredible.  The owner (I think) came up to us to take our order for the egg roll. How cool is that?  At almost 9PM (sorry staff!!) everyone started to show up.  This is when staff #2 kicked in.. they had a few people helping out our table and not once did they skip a beat.  They were on us the entire time. had our food exactly the way it was, all the drinks.. anything.  I could not believe perfect it was.   Im also a huge fan of edemame and they had the best I've had.  I knew Id be in for a treat.   We ordered a rainbow roll and also the Marilyn Monroll... cool name huh?  Both were insanely delicious.  I cant wait to go back here.!!!

We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.  When I showed up there was a line of about 20 people ahead of me.  i asked them to put me in first available and they said 15-20min and then 45min for a booth.  Ok, I'll wait.  Our friends showed up and my girlfriend had asked if there was a spot at the bar we could sit in the mean time.  We were there for about 10min already.  That's when she said to us. "Your table inside is ready"  she walked us right there and we were sat.  WOW!  that was quick!  We ordered drinks and food.  I got these jerk chicken wings for an appetizer and holy cow, they were delicious.  For my main dish I ordered a garlic noodle dish.  It definitely hit the spot.  My only beef would be that it was hard to talk with so many people inside.  I wont let that affect the rating though.  Awesome place!

THIS is probably he last of great malls.  I live just down the street from this megaplex of greatness. If you want an idea of what Chandler Fashion Center is, think Tempe Marketplace, Desert Ridge, all bundled up indoors with 'you name it' things to do and see there.    The mall itself is incredible, but that's just the mall.  They have all the stores you could want.  They're not full of only urban clothing and jewelry stores like Metro, Desert Sky and Christown have; but a huge variety of awesomeness.  But outside the mall is where it gets better.  You can see a movie and the awesome Harkins, catch a bite to eat at pretty much anything you could imagine (The Keg, Cheesecake Factory, Firebirds, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc).  If you have the kids, they have this cool play area just outside of Barnes & Noble where they can hang out.  By kids I mean 3-6 year olds. Nothing for the older kids.. let them hang out in the food court where most do.    Right behind the mall, you can find Target Greatland, Costco, Sports Authority.. yeah ya see??  This place has it all.  You want a great mall experience, definitely choose Chandler Fashion Center. The BEST mall in Arizona.

ULTIMATE CHIMICHANGA!!!!  Need I say more?  I went there, not once, not twice, but three frigging times this last week because of the Phoenix Film Festival.  It was amazing all three times.  I love their chips/salsa and like the headline says.. the Ultimate Chimichanga was insanely delicious.  In fact, I am craving it as I type this.  I wish you were closer Chimi!  Good service, the people are always on top of your drinks/chips and anything else you need. The place can be pricey, so watch the drinks you order.    I cant wait to go again. :)

I've been to this place at least 20 times and I am now just writing a review?!  Butterfield's is hands down, the best breakfast place I have ever been too.  Their food is always so fresh with so many delicious choices.  If you get a chance be sure to try their cinnamon swirl pancakes.  Had them and was blown away.   I bit of advice is to either be early or eat at their off times.  Butterfield's is known for good food and also long waits.  On a Sat/Sun morning, you could drive by and easily see 40-50 people waiting outside (and that's just outside!).  Honestly, it is well worth the wait.  Staff is great and service is quick.

Have you ever been to a bowling alley or skating ring and ordered food from there?   If you said yes, then that's what you can expect from Burger Palace.  A pretty dive of a place.. and by dive, I dont mean a cool hidden gem you see on the Food Network.    This place has the look of feel of a place straight out of the 80s, but in a bad way.  Small tables and chairs.  booths that are made for kids, not adults; and you gotta love spending $3 on a drink that's considered small in most fast food joints.  I got a burger that was barely ok to eat.  Sadly this was our back up plan after not going to Ginseng3.. or whatever you call it.  Imperial Palace.. I think we'll pass next time on your dumpy casino.

Evil Place!!!  That's right.. I walked in there and I couldnt believe it.  The people were nice to me, asking me if I needed help and by the end of the day, i had a new kitten!  All joking aisde, I love this place.  I know you can buy food and other things cheaper at grocery stores, but I kinda like a specialty store like Petsmart.  The staff is great and anything you need they are more than willing to help out.  To this day I have purchased two cats here and both are still awesome and amazing.  The last kitten my girlfriend actually picked up and when I went in there to pick up some food, they remembered which kitten we got.  Apparently she was among the favorites that was adopted.    You want good service and a great place for your pets.. Petsmart is the best!

I first learned of Firebirds a couple years ago by "Lets try something new."  That new place because a favorite of mine in Chandler.  I would go as to say this is probably the best steak Ive had in town.    When you first pull int the parking lot, you can smell the grill from a mile away.  Just an incredible smell.  Thinking about it right now makes me want to jump into my car and head over there.  The staff is very nice there and of course like all fine dining places, everyone there looks like they stepped off of GQ and Vogue Magazines. The place has a nice steakhouse feel to it.  Wood all over, deer head mounted on all, and you can see the cooks making your food right in the back.  Always nice to see what's going on with the food.    The things I love most about this place is their bread.  Fresh sour dough loaves that come out piping hot with butter.  I call it "Butt Bread;" for those who have been here, you know why.  Best bread Ive had at a restaurant.  Another great addition is their BLT salad.  They have this great garlic ranch dressing that I have not seen anywhere else.  That with bacon bits, lettuce and tomato... delicious.  My personal favorite is their rib-eye and their dipped in, loaded baked potato.  I get the same thing every time now.  Yes I have tried other things and they were amazing.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.  My parents went with my girlfriend and I once and my dad ate 3 loaves of the bread himself.  Yeah... good stuff.

If anyone was ever been to Chick-fil-A, you'll notice a few things..  1.  How incredibly polite their employees are "Hi, how may I serve you today?" 2.  How good the food is 3.  How polite they remain...  We had lunch here this past weekend and once again a very nice young tween took our order with a smile from ear to ear.  I paid, and shortly our food was ready to go.   I like to eat mayonnaise with my chicken nuggets while my girlfriend eats a mixture of their chick-fil-a sauce and the Polynesian sauce.  It's good, trust me..    The place was packed, so my girlfriend stood to scope out a table when one would be available.  She found it.  We sat in the most perfect spot for people watching.. I love to people watch. I could do it all day.  Funny moment though...  One of the employees dropped one lonely nugget on the ground and for ten minutes, we sat and watched people walk over this one nugget.  The employee that dropped it stepped over it.. (not exagerating) 8 times.  He kept looking at us like "What??"  ...we just grinned.  It was fun.  Finally he picked it up.  Good place, good food, good times.

Ive been to probably five or six sushi places in the valley and this is by far the best Ive had.   Never had I eaten such fresh sushi that it literally made me sit back each bite and just go "WOW."    Im also a huge fan of Edamame and the way they make it is they boil it in brine, so there's no need for salt on top.  Each one is amazing.  Though it's far from me right now, I'll be heading to the west valley soon.. which means I'll be closer.. Muahahahahaha..   Great eats guys!!

My girlfriend always wants this place and I never do.  It's not that the food is bad because it really is tasty.  I just get sick of always having it...  Seems to come up as that quick place to grab a  bite.  Even though I whine about this place, I do enjoy it.  This weekend at the Phoenix Film Festival we ate here on Sunday and the food was once again yum.  I guess I do the forbidden with my waffle fries, but I like to dip them in mayonnaise.  What else do you put on them? Catchup?? ewwww..  ruins the taste.  I get crap for it, but why do you think they put the mayo out there?  Oh what? it's for the chicken sandwich? Ahhh.. Oh well.   The nuggets are awesome and if you can, top it off with some good ole sweet tea.   The odd and really cool thing about Chick Fil A is that the people are ridiculously nice here. "Hi, welcome to Chick Fil A, how may I server you?"  Who says that?    One time I saw one of their female employees actually carry two bags of food out to this one guys car.. with him.   As nice as it was, Ive never seen so many people look at him in disgust.  I get allowing people to be nice, but don't be a punk and take advantage of them.      It's like going to the grocery store after buying a pack of gum and when they ask to help, you say "sure."  Just not cool.  Anyways..  they are great here.

Some might walk into Freddy's and think.. "Hey this is like Culvers.."   Sure, they both sell burgers and custard, but I tell ya what..  Freddy's burgers are far tastier and the custard is out of this world.  How's that for an 80s commercial?  I got a bacon cheeseburger with fries.  I had no idea their fries were shoestring, but I loved them even more.  You can get carried away with fries and end up stuffing yourself.  These work just right.  I added some of their special seasoning on top and went to town.   Only bad thing was when I have a good burger, I can usually inhale the thing in about a minute.. the burger was gone in about 90 seconds.  Sorry! it was good!!   My girlfriend leaned over and said to me after I ate it.. "really??"  I know..  Sue me. It was good.  If I had to compare it to anything, id say Smashburger.  Which I also love.    For dessert I had a great medley of custard, caramel, chocolate and pecans.. MMmmm.. super good.

I've been coming to this location well over 25 year and this place is still a great place to eat a great Prim Rib dinner.  Service is always top notch.  Their bread is incredible and not to mention their Caesar salads.  They are huge and so good!  Keep up the great work guys!

Funny story..    For years I thought this place was somehow related to Pizza Hut, but I guess there's is called something else.  I hear they get that all the time.  Finally, I decide to go inside because I'm hungry and I guess pizza hut wings would do..   Soooo glad I was wrong.  Wing Stop is a place that specializes in just wings.. win? I think so.  They have about 6-8 different flavors if I recall, but my personal favorite is the dusted Garlic Parmesan.  I can easily put 10 away.   Now the way th ey do their wings is they dont do dozens, but instead they offer them in 10s and for an additional 2.95 ask if you want 5 more? clever huh?  I usually end up doing that.    Oh don't forget to try their french fries.. holy crap..  they are fresh cut fries that are actually sweet!   de-frigging-licious.   My girlfriend always gets them with a side of hot cheese sauce.  I end up eating a few, walking away with a big smile.  I'm noticing the bad reviews here, but I personally have always been happy here.    Why not 5 stars?  Because they're not the best wings Ive ever had.  That's a toss up between Native New Yorkers, Oregano's and Zipps wings.  These guys are up there though.

This is like any other Starbucks, so nothing major to report; but the fact that it's an out of town location.  I checked in on Four Square and noticed that the tip read that the people who worked here were horrible and snobby or something like that.  I saw two girls working there and I can kind of see how one of them could be seen that way, but she was nice to me.  Ordered our drinks and out the door we were.  Went there twice in a weekend and both times were pleasant.

We went here last week while in Vegas and you cant miss this place.. the outside has the owners face on the front sign.    We sat down and the waiter took our drink orders and some how he wasnt all there because he was bouncing around like a fish out of water. Guess he was just there for drinks.  He gave my iced tea to my friend, and went to get me another one.. yeah.. I know.    Waitress came over to order our food and used some little electronic device (pretty cool).  I dont know.. for some reason I got the impression she was a little.. pissy?  She seemed impatient.  Maybe that's just me.  We get the food and guess what.. it was actually pretty good.  I ordered a chimichanga with rice and beans.  Pretty simple, but i like simple things. My girlfriend ordered a lemon drop martini with her cheese crisp and hated it I guess.  Cheese crisp was good though.  We had the honor of having some Mariachi guys play for us.  They were awesome!  For that along, Im bumping my original 3 stars to 4 stars.

My girlfriend's family frequents this place and now we're part of the festivities here.  What a rockin cool place.  It's a total biker bar and it feels like it's straight out of a movie.  They have a kitchen that cooks great burgers and appetizers.  The drinks are endless and the bartenders are beyond kind.  they know how to treat their customers.  Make sure you tip them!  They have 2 large pool tables and 3 dart boards that are always in action.  They have this old table that is right in the middle and it has carvings and markings from anyone and everyone who has ever been there.  Very vintage!  I love this place and enjoy being a part of this awesome venue!

I used to be a huge fan of this place, but it was just ok this time around..  A bunch of us went and I ordered their steak for two.. 22oz. Thought it might be good.  It was dry and had no flavor.  She had asked at the beginning "Do you guys want A-1?"  I said "No thanks."  A good steak shouldn't need any sauce.  I should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg..  We also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  I love the one they do at Cheesecake  Factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.    Everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  He got the chicken fried steak.  Cant really mess that up I guess.  it was pretty good.   Id go back, but Im not the fan i used to be of this place.

Since Im big into breakfast foods, Im always on the look out for a new place.. and whadda ya know. .I found "The Place"  How convieeeeent..   I read the reviews and when asking a few people on Facebook about it, I heard nothing good good responses, so why not give it a shot.  I heard that you have to be early or it gets insane.  We showed up about 9AM and waited for maybe 5min.  Not too bad.   The menu looked incredible and as I watched the servers take food to the tables, I could see that the amounts of food give were enormous.  I couldn't wait.  Checking the reviews on Yelp, I ordered a chorizo omelet with avocado, and all the fixens.  I thought I'd love it, but I think I was more overwhelmed with spice than anything. and I love spicy food.. what gives?    The second time we all went, we got there at 8AM and sat right away.. this time I was told to order biscuits and gravy..  Damn were they good.  I got an order of those along with a huge pancake.   Here's what I loved about their pancakes.. they tasted home cooked.  Like when your mom takes out the old griddle that still has last weeks charred food on it,  yet still cooks on it, and it has that home yummy taste? Yep.. that's their pancakes.   Downed that with some iced tea and it was one awesome breakfast.    Ive been here three times now in two months... I think Im hooked.

I once ate hear years ago with some friends and really enjoyed it.  Then recently my friends told me that this place has gone down hill some..  Well...  I beg to differ.  I love this place.  I love breakfast.. so when you put the two together, you get a nice marriage of good food and plenty of it.  There is so much stuff to try here and I dont know where to begin on what, but just open the cool newspaper menu and go to town. Im sure this place is not for everyone, but it always seems crowded on a Sunday morning.  The staff has always been friendly and they have a Jack Black look-a-like working there too... pretty cool stuff.. lol.

McDonald's is getting a bad rap here, I can see.  Yeah, it's not the best one out there, but it's not the worst.   Ive only been here for breakfast, so that's what im basing my review on.  I use the drive-thru.. maybe that works too.    I get my usual vanilla iced coffee and oat meal in the mornings and have never been disappointed.  The girl at the pay window always seems friendly and has is smiling all the time.  The girl who gives me my food is the same way.  Only time I've had problems was this morning when the manager of all people, didnt give me my spoon!! serious!!!..  just kidding.    It's McDonalds.. not a 5 star restaurant..  :)

I've been here three times in a week.  What does that say?  My first trip I had their egg salad sandwich.  I was not a fan. Seemed too dry and I like my egg salad with just egg salad and maybe some mayo on bread. No need to put lettuce on it.    On my second trip I had their Cordon Bleu and holy crap was that an insanely awesome sandwich!  Every bite better than the next.  It was a bit messy, but that's what napkins are for!   On my most recent, I had their ruben and again.. awesome!    I've been during their lunch rush and they always seem to get the food out pretty fast.   Love it!

Places like this makes me wish we had gambling in Phoenix.  Yeah that's a bit much, but awesome bar/club/restaurants like this wont go to just a regular town.    I love the whole look of this place.  Neon lights in a killer font that says Diablo's Cantina and a hot lookin red demon girl standing up there looking on LV Blvd.    Im not a drinker, but those I was with are, so they quickly ordered drinks while I got my usual iced tea. Great tea btw.   We were looking for something small to tide us over for dinner later.   Kat was our waitress and she couldn't have been nicer.  When a waitress comes back to check on your every five min and still is able to take care of all her tables, that shows experience.  I asked her how the nachos were and she said they were very popular.  Ok,  a four cheese nacho right away makes me smile...  About 10min later she brings out this huge tray of melted cheese that have a few nachos sticking out from inside it.. lol.  Ahhhh  cheese heaven.    All four of us enjoyed the nachos and we couldn't finish them.  Damn delicious!  Can't wait to go back to this place.  Very cool!  Also the wait wasn't that bad.  We went about 5-ish and maybe waited for 15min.

On our way to a wedding in Utah, we decided a nice diversion to Las Vegas was in hand.  We stayed at the Planet Hollywood Casino & Resort. I figured you can't beat $80 for a night when it usually runs $250.  In looking for a place to eat we decided to stay inside.  Of course I pulled up my handy Yelp app on my phone and said "hey, we should try this place.. Earl.. of Sandwich.."  Girlfriend said yes and we headed down.  The place was pretty packed for mid afternoon, but as I got close I could tell why.  The aroma that filled the air quickly covered up the sweat and machine smell from the machines in the casino.    I ordered their new chicken chipotle sandwich.   Ok,  l love sandwiches, but honestly... usually sandwiches are sandwiches, but let me tell ya what, Earl knows their sandwich.  The service was wonderful and the food was even more delicious than the smell itself.   The only bad part was that I tend to eat good food too quickly.. and yeah, my sandwich was awesome.    Earl was so good that we went back for breakfast before we headed out.    That's gotta say something for this place.. twice in 24 hours?  Oh yeah.

I cant believe this place only has 2.5 stars.  My girlfriend come here at least once a week.   We usually come here about 9PM or after and have always had the best service.  Ali is usually our waitress and knows what we love.  The food is wonderful and nothing beats a stack of fresh pancakes.  Ihop is the best at that.  Last night we actually ate light and for once I didnt get pancakes.. I know crazy!  But I did feel good after and not full like usual. haha.    Thanks for the great service!

Oh, where to begin..  I stopped by Pappadeaux last week to grab a bite when on a Wed, they told me it was a 45min wait for two.. wow.  The place was packed.   The hostess recommended we make a reservation for the weekend, so we made one for Friday at 7PM.  The smells coming from the place when you first pull in automatically keep you wondering what delicious things are waiting inside.    I'm so glad we did.   We showed up and they gave us a card with a number and once our number showed up on the screen, it was seating time.  I think we waited maybe ten minutes.  After gazing over the menu for a quick minute, we decided to try the fried alligator with creole sauce.  Being one to enjoy new things, I was pretty excited.  The waiter took our drink orders and and put in the appetizer.  The place at this point was insanely packed, but it was nice to see a place like this.  Made ya feel that something good was to come.  Heck, a place cant' suck if it's this packed, right?   So we order our food, I decided on the stuffed shrimp and the rest of my friends all ordered different things.  It would be a share-a-meal night..   About 10min into drinks and conversation, they bring out the fried alligator..  Ok, if you've never eaten anything weird before.  Please please.. you've got to try this.  It sorta reminded me of a cross between soft pork or chicken.  The taste literally melted in my mouth.  To top it off, the creole sauce that went with it, only complimented it.  I could easily have eaten the entire plate alone.  Sadly, I had to share..  After quickly destroying the fried alligator, we got our entrees.  I took one bite and had to pause a moment.. the taste of the stuff shrimp with the crab, Alfredo, spices inside just floored me.  There were only six pieces, but after sharing a piece or two and eating the amazing green beans, this was plenty of food.   I can't wait for my next trip here.. fantastic food.

Decided to go here because of the reviews here..  Picked up the Lucky Burger with 1000 Island dressing, took a bite and literally said..  "My God that's a good burger..."  and had to pause to write this real quick.  I'll let you know how the rest was shortly...  **after burger**  Holy s***...  The charbroil taste of every bite along with the flavor of meat, 1000island dressing and the veggies just sent this burger to the top of my list.  Imagine going to a family BBQ and everyone's favorite grill master is behind the grill doing his work.. this is what it's like.  The fries were also fresh and crunchy, just the way I like it.  Glad this is close to work, cause I will be a regular here.    ...sucks im on a diet!

Ok, I know I shouldn't even go to this place, but how can you not pass up a place called The Heart Attack Grill?  Im a big burger lover and the burgers here are just delicious.  Yes, I am aware of how they make the burgers and what they use on the buns and fries.  If you sit and think about what you're eating, you wont enjoy a thing.  if you just sit back, enjoy your surroundings and food, you're gonna have a helluva time.  Ive been here three times...  Loved it each time.    TIP: Try not to go here but once a month.  It is a shit ton of calories you're taking in.

I've always been partial to Harkins Theaters because they have the best seats.  I used to say, "You know what would be the best theater?  AMC experience, with Harkins seats.."  Guess what.. AMC Westgate is the birth of the spawn of just that.  I love this place.  It's frigging massive to start with and has everything inside it.  Not to mention an IMAX.  The experience is great and the chairs are super comfortable.  Nothing really more to say that it's a theater.  I do like the new Stubs card that they put out.  Yeah it sucks that you have to pay for it, but it's only $12 a  year.  Not bad for all the free stuff you get.  Another cool thing about this theater is the location.  If you are going to grab dinner/lunch before hand, ther eis a ton of places to choose from.  Nice work AMC on making a great theater!!  Ohhh big big big heads up.  Be sure to see a movie before Noon or ya get to pay nice big money.   that's probably the draw back.  I'll still give you 5 stars.

We were looking for a new sushi place after having a bad experience at our old local place, Kabuki.  So after 'Yelping' it, we found this place.  When walking in, it had the nice smell of.. a hair and nail salon.  Oddly there were none around.  Once walking in, you definitely got the nice aroma of sushi around you.  And No, not the fishy smell.    We sat and ordered the drinks.  heads up.. if you want soda, this place is not on fountain  yet, so get ready to pay $1.50 a can.  Glad I drank iced tea.   So my review is based on the food alone.  I had probably the best Rainbow Roll I have ever eaten.  It was so good.. that after I was done, i ordered another one.    I usually get the edemame, but there's wasnt that great.  It wasnt bad, it just didint 'wow' me.    Would I go here again? Definitely.   This place is really packed.. which is so odd because it's not in a great location.  Good food I guess! :)

This place is just wonderful.  I have a friend who's recommended we all go there many times.  Usually when you think "sushi buffet' I think of the other places that service sushi and stick it under a lamp.  Not my cup of tea.    We show up, they sit us quickly and bring out the drinks, soup and edimame.  We all agree we're here for the all you can eat and begin to load up the order slip. Shortly after, they bring out this boat with all sorts of sushi.  We ate until we were nearly exploded.  It was a delight!

Im not judging this on the coffee at all.. this 2 stars goes to how slow this place is.   I was once in the drive-thru for 20min..  when we pulled up, they gave us the coffee for free.  Ever since it seems I average 10min per visit.  That's hella long.   TIP:  If you are going in the mornings before work. DO NOT use the drive thru...  go inside, it's much faster.

Im so glad I can update my review of this place...  Let me tell you all the past and what happened this past week.    My girlfriend and I always frequent Starbucks and this is one of the locations that she is a regular at.     Every day, if not twice a day, she comes here and will order a Venti Iced Caramel Macchiato, no ice (because she has sensitive teeth), skinny and mixed well.  What they do with no ice is that they add milk to fill it up.  For almost 4 months now, she's never had a problem with that.  But this last week, after getting her coffee she noticed that her usual coffee was no $.75 more.  What??  When asking the girl behind the window to explain, she said that was for the few ounces of milk.    Last I checked, a gallon of milk was about $2.00.  So you're telling me for barely 3/4 of a cup, you are going to charge $.75?  WOW.  She asked to speak to the manager, who you could tell loved being the manager of a Starbucks.. Oh the power.  She kindly mentioned that she was a regular customer and this is the first she's been charged for this. He rudely replied "well we have to charge for milk since you dont want ice.  Do you want your coffee or not?"    I wont say what i was thinking, but she did.. lol.  She said "Ill take my damn coffee and never be back here again!"    Seriously, every other Starbucks we visit and its probably 4 or 5 total,  have never charged to add milk.  In fact, she's such a regular that they usually start making her drink when she walks in.  Was it worth it Starbucks on 43rd??  Get a new manager who actually is nice to the customers.    Im done.    NO wonder this place has horrible  reviews.

I've been here three times in the past year.  The first time, I really liked their house special chicken.. the second time (a few weeks ago), we tried their Mongolian beef.  Wow..  Just amazing.   We ordered their Wor soup last time we were here.  I wasn't completely thrilled, but I still ate it.  What's really good is their egg rolls.   They come in an order of two with sweet n sour and hot mustard.  Make sure to mix the two! amazing taste.   Our recent trip we had Mongolian beef, house special chicken and orange chicken.  Just delicious food.  I love going to a Chinese restaurant and know what Im getting.  Sorry if that means its too American Chinese, but it's good food.    Also the staff is wonderful there.   I love when the staff can walk over and start up a conversation about anything, making you feel like one of the family.    I love this place and  highly recommend it.  If you don't like it.. eh.. oh well, might just be my own personal taste then.  If you do.. awesome!.

This location is one of the older ones, but it definitely stacks up to the new location.  It's clean, smells normal and 95% of the equipment is always working.  So that's a plus.  I would have given it 5 stars if the dang juice bar they have was open when we were there.  Seems to only be open for people who can work out during the day...  Trainers are great and always willing to help and what I love about this place.. It's not that crowded.  I like to shoot hoops, so early in the morning, I can usually have the court to myself.  We also recently tarted to play racquetball and have a blast doing that.  it's a great work out if you've never done it.  I would call this my home LA Fitness along with the new one on 17 & Northern.

I'm so glad to be writing this review based on my second visit.  We had a group of about 22 people and had one waitress taking care of all of us.  The food was fast, delicious and she never missed any of our drinks and always made sure we were good.  I was impressed!

The reviews here seem pretty bad, but Im basing this review on the fried okra my girlfriend had..  She said it was the best she's ever had.  One problem..  it's not around the corner, but we'll still get it if we're here.  That's all we got.  So we have no idea how the other food tastes.. based on reviews, Im going to guess.. not so great.

I went here a few weeks ago for the first time for lunchtime and was blown away.  My god, the food here is delicious.   I got the beef gyro combo and the mass amount of food was huge.  You could easily split it with two people!  If you  havent been here, you gotta stop and eat here.  Great food and great staff!

Ive been wanting to try this place for years. This year was my 40th birthday and what a better place to try than Fogo.    My girlfriend and I made reservations with her brother and wife.  What I loved is when we showed up, we were seated immediately.  I've been to places with a reservation and they would say "Oh it'll be just a moment" and 10 min later...  Right as we sit down, one of our many wait staff comes over to us to take our drink orders and lets us know that we can begin our meal.  They have a huge salad bar, but I was told by a friend "Do NOT eat it if you want to fill up on meat!"   So my girlfriend got the salad bar and I ate some of the cheese. It was delicious!  We guys flipped over our card to green and it was on.  We must have seen 10 different guys come by with different meats.  My favorites were their house special, sirloin and filet wrapped in bacon.  We ate like kings!    To top it off we even had room for cheesecake.  I highly recommend this place. It was pure heaven.  It is a bit pricey though.  ABout $50 a head.  But soooo worth it!

The 5 stars I give this place is not for their food, because we all know what McDonalds is.  I go here almost every morning for my iced coffee that I love and adore.  I give them 5 stars because Ive come to know the staff there and they just rock.    Maritza, Kiara, Maria and BB are among the best there and make my mornings a great one.

So I finally find my favorite breakfast place and it happens to be in Henderson, NV... what luck.   We hit this delicious place up right before we left back to Phoenix and damn..  that's all I can say.  DAMN DELICIOUS!  You go inside this place that happens to be inside of a strip mall and right away it has that home cooked meal feel to it.  The friendly staff seats in a booth (which we always prefer) and we get the drink orders out of the way.  I love iced tea, but their tea wasn't the best. Trust me, Im not knocking down stars for that. lol.     As I look over the menu, I always find myself always getting the same type of food.. omelet or pancakes with some sides.  I decided to go out of the box and try something new.  Ready for this?  Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast...     Yep..  I ordered that and let me tell you how amazing it was.  It was about six good sized slices that were filled with peanut butter and grilled to perfection, topped with bananas and honey, finished off with some hot maple syrup.  I was in breakfast heaven.    I could have easily split this meal up with someone and didn't finish it, but I highly recommend it.. especially if you love peanut butter!  i cant wait to get back to this place!

First time going to this wonderful little market place and eatery. Had breakfast before work and it was quite pleasing.  I got a egg & sausage sandwich on english muffin.  Tasted like something from the my own kitchen.  Just wonderful. Service was great too. I believe the manager was sitting next to us eating her own breakfast and was talking to us about the place.  Very nice, and I promise you we will be back!  Thank you!

Extremely friendly people here!  I like to get their munchkins.. love those things. But I did learn one thing.. when you ask for assorted flavors, dont.. Unlike 10 years ago when you only had a few flavors for Munchkins, they now have about 6 flavors.  So this time I had to be specific and ask for cinnamon, powdered, glazed, and chocolate.  Delicious!  If you want the fresh donuts, be there early!!  Also Dunkin has killer coffee!!  the best!

I happen to find this gem of a place on my way to a meeting downtown.  I thought "sushi sounds good" and opened up the  Yelp app on my phone and Moira popped up.  When walking into this place, you forget that you're in Phoenix.. I felt like I was in Los Angeles and one of their trendy spots.  We are there right as they open and are quickly seated.  The waiter takes our drink orders and since it's happy hour, we decide on some food and drinks.    I dont recall the name of the dish, but the waiter sells us on their special and damn was it good.  It was spicy, something.. that's all I remember.  This is what ya get for writing a review so late.   Being a new sushi lover of only six months, I try to taste all that I can and there wasnt a thing we tried that wasnt good.  Just a great place.    I did notice that everyone who came in were women and blonde.. was there a convention in town?  I look forward to my next venture at this restaurant.

I love this place.  I work with most of these people for the Horror & Sci-Fi Film Festival (which is happening tonight!) and Madcap Theaters couldn't be a more perfect venue for such a killer event.  I love going into the theater knowing that I feel at home.  I actually saw one of the last movies there before they shut down the Centerpoint Harkins.   The people are great, the movies are awesome.  Seriously, when can you see "Dont Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead" on the big screen anymore?   Every month they show the worst best movie you've seen.. "The Room."  If you haven't checked it out, i highly recommend it.  Btu you must see it with a big crowd.. dont go download it and watch it at home.  A must see for all.  Madcap holds a monthly screening of this as well as Rocky Horror Picture SHow (seen it once and that was enough).  Parking isn't so great here because you have to pay to park in the garage, but I've learn to live with it.  If you're hungry, you can walk over to PF Changs or Chilis across the way or that new sushi place that took over Uno's Pizzeria.    This place just has the coolest vintage feel going through out the entire place.  It kinda reminds me of (im showing my age here) the old United Artists Theaters that used to be outside of Metrocenter near the library.  If anyone remembers all the posters they had everywhere. Just a cool feeling.  Andrea Beasley-Brown (aka Midnite Movie Mamacita) runs her shows there's and it's never a dull moment.  So check it out people! You wont be sorry.

That's too bad this place has such low reviews.  My guess is the people are probably complaining about how busy it gets.  Well duh.. stick a gym in the middle of the Biltmore area, of course it'll get packed.    Best time to go is in the early morning or mid day.  DO NOT go at 5PM.. because you will be waiting a long time for any equipment.   What I love about this place is the staff is friendly and they have their own NRGize Cafe that i love getting the shakes from. Yummm..  I love this place so I wont complain.  Why not 5 stars then?  Well because I too have been here when it's busy and it sucks.. but I wont ruin the review over it.  :)

Oh how I've been waiting to write a review on this place.  I love Starbucks like the next person, but one thing that doesnt gel with me is when you have a huge event in town (Phoenix Comicon) and the local Starbucks (and most of their staff) is not willing to work with you.  During the weekend of Phoenix Comicon i heard stories along with myself about the horrible service people encountered.  I'll tell mine.. I go in there to get my coffee and strike up a friendly (or so I thought) conversation about Comicon.  I ask "Are you guys ready for the massive business this weekend?"  They reply with "Yes we are" and then I ask "Are you guys staying open longer?"  they closed at 2PM every day... Pathetic.  This guy (damn forgot his name) goes on to tell me..  "I tell ya what, if you want to open your own coffee stand outside, you can make all the money you want out there, but we're not staying open"     What a douche I thought..  and the guy in the background was nodding in agreement.    That was the last coffee I bought from them.  I also heard that one of the celebrities was in line outside to get a coffee and then went to cut the line because they were closing.  When one of the reps spoke up and asked nicely about who they were getting coffee for, the Starbucks guy replies with "I dont care who it is, we're closing."  A buddy of mine happened to be in line inside the store and heard this.. he runs outside, takes the money from the rep and gets the guy a coffee.  Very cool of him.  I just cant believe that Starbucks would hire these jerks in the morning to act like this.   I recommend that if there's another Starbucks around, to go there before this place.  Then again.. they probably wouldn't care because they hate being open anyways.

So we are trying to find a sushi place and walk by the Imperial Palace Casino cause we see a sign for this place.  Right away I wasnt feeling it, but the group I was with was desperate and hungry.  *sigh*    After asking where the place is, we had up to the 4th or 5th floor.  The place is nearly deserted.  Only 2 people are there and you'd think they were gettin ready to close.    After getting seated we order some sodas.  I ask for Diet Pepsi, in which they bring me a glass of ice and a CAN of Diet Pepsi.. $3 FRIGGING Dollars.  Are you kidding me?  I can nearly by a 12-pack for that much.  What a rip off.    After going through the menu and realizing this is not a real sushi place, we all decide to not eat there. My buddy's girlfriend orders some soup (which I guess was good.. that's the two stars..) and we throw down $10 and get out of there.    Bleh...

Ive never been much for trying new places... Mainly because Im usually disappointed.  So I stick with what I know.  Hula's was a new place and by the stars above you can imagine how my visit was.  We had put in reservations for 25 people here and while they were hesitant they happily put us outside on this large table under the misters and shade.  Perfect setting.  I don't recall the waitress name, but she did something great in the beginning.  We all would be on separate tabs and she wrote all our names down.  Some places go by where you sit and will flip out if you move. She rocked this.  We all started with many drinks and any appetizers.  Let me tell you this.. I hate sweet potato fries.  I really do.. however their sweet potato fries with their dipping sauce was to die for.  I couldn't eat enough of them.  I kept looking at my friends with this "are you kidding me??" face.   Delicious  Dinner came and it was ncie to literally see everyone order something different.  If you have friends and dinner that means you have a ton of food to sample.  We did just that.    I ordered the Ahi Wasabi Bowl on white rice with black beans.  Holy crap that was amazing.  I usually get a burger, but wanted to break my burger streak.. so I did this.  A few friends did burgers and I did sample some of them.  I couldn't believe how good they were!  The drinks were awesome, food was great and the service at this place just kicks ass all over town.  I can't wait to go back!!

It's not often that I would give a resort restaurant a good review.  Probably because we usually stray from them because they are often a billion dollars by the time you leave the place.  We decided upon dinner here while staying at the Biltmore for the Hell City Convention.  Since we live in town, I know the area pretty well so our options were anything in the Biltmore area or Frank & Alberts.  I had passed by the menu earlier and figured we'd try it.  We showed up about 6-7ish for dinner and there was no wait, but plenty of people inside.   We were nicely sat right next to the kitchen and almost instantly our drink orders were taken by the smiling Elizabeth. After our drinks we ordered our food and within 20min, our food was out.  While waiting for our food they gave us some bread and a couple dips that were delicious.  One was a chipotle ketchup and the other was a green olive aole type drip.  Both great.  We ordered some onion rings that came stacked in a nice formation along with some buttermilk ranch.  We all ate a few of those, but had saved more for later.  it was dinner time..    One of our friends had eaten so he grabbed a dessert that he said was one of the best he's ever eaten.  My girlfriend and I ordered the prime rib.  For $25, I thought this was a great price for such a fancy establishment.   I haven't had this tasty of a prime rib cut in a long time.  Every bite was better than the next.  Along with that was a huge piece of broccoli and a nicely cooked baked potato.  The meal was amazing.  But the meal was just a part of it..  Our server Elizabeth would always drop by to make sure we had what we needed.  They were so on top of things, if they over heard us comment on something, they would rush over to make sure we had it.  The staff was ridiculously nice and even the chef came out to check on our food.  I don't think I've ever had a better experience at a restaurant like  I did here.   Frank & Alberts knows food and knows how to take care of their customers.  Well done.  We loved this place so much that we werent here three times during our stay this past weekend.

I still love the food here.  it's quick, good and the service has always been great to me.  Sucks that they're trading staff with the Central location.  Oh well..  I haven't been here in years, but ordered my favorite Yakisoba and an egg roll.  I personally think these guys have the best egg rolls.    Also the owner actually works out of this location.  On occasion, Ive seen a few Suns drop in too.  Good times, good stuff!

In-N-Out has the best french fries next to... dont kill me, but Heart Attack Grill.. haha i know.. nasty huh.  They are just too damn good.  Why? Because they are fresh cut and not frozen quadruple fried french fries.  One of the reasons I love this place is that its so simple too.  Burgers and Fries.. that's it.  Their vanilla milk shakes are pretty rock too.    Ya can't go wrong here!

I stopped in here on my way to AMC Westgate and it was pretty dead.. mainly because it was about 4:30PM.  Who drinks coffee that late?    ..I do.  The girl behind the counter was extremely friendly and I commented that I had never been here. Im usually a Starbucks person.  So I ordered the same drink I order at Starbucks.  She made the drink more than perfect.  Just the right amount of flavor in each sip.   Very cool place.  The set up was actually nicer that most Starbucks I have been too.  Made me want to go home and grab my laptop and come back and work.  I'll be back!

This place just opened up a few months ago and my girlfriend was thrilled because she loves this place.  I enjoy some Chick-fil-A, but  have grown to get tired of the same stuff.  BUT...  They have the best waffle fries and their nuggets are pretty dang tasty.  I love this location (i assume most are like this) because the people there are so insanely nice.  Who says "How may i serve you?"  One time we were eating there and this server was helping a guy with his food and asked "Could  I help you out with these?"  He was alone, probably 30's, and had two free hands.. she walks out with three bags and having trouble moving.  The entire place was watching in awe as he let her carry his food to his car.  Who does that??  Chick-fil-A does..    The drive-thru likes to fool you though.. as a male.. I pull up and hear this sweet sweet voice "Hi, welcome to Chick-fil-A, how may I serve you?"  Of course I get why people do this.. females just come off as more pleasant.  But once you pull up to the window, it's some weird old guy..... bah..   Oh well.  Still a good place to eat.

I love buffets.. and for Las Vegas I guess you sorta want the best of the best in buffets.  We paid $17 per person for this place and it was ok at best.  The food seemed like it was out for quite a while and they werent exactly speedy on replacing it with fresh food.  I guess the best buffets out there arent the ones at the big casinos, but the small places.  Heck even for GOlden Nugget, I was hoping even with it not being that big.  Ehh.. Oh well.   Will I go back?  Sure...  but not for dinner.

This place was top notch. My girlfriend knows the owners and yesterday they were having a fund raiser for the 19 firemen who died in Yarnell, AZ.    The first thing I noticed was how clean the place was.   We got a special tour of the small place and were told what the favorite flavors were. We even were given samples.  They had a ton of toppings that would go on top of the deliciousness! Everything from fresh fruit, your choice of syrups, candy, candy bars, brownies, even sea salt!   We will definitely be coming back here.  It is in north scottsdale, but so worth the drive!

My girlfriend lives by here and I drive by this place literally everyday on my way home.   So we were thinking of grabbing burgers from another place when we saw that it was closed.  I took out my phone and pulled up Yelp to see what was around.  Saw the reviews and said "Hey lets try Bueno Burger"  Sounds good! they all said.  We walk in and the small of mesquite smacks you in the face.. Dammnn.. it smelled amazing.    We ordered a bunch of burgers with fries.  Near the end my girlfriend noticed that they had sweet potato fries and asked if it was too late.  Not only did they make a fresh batch for her, but they also threw in the reg fries that were done too.  Here's a cool thing.. on Sundays if you order an entree, you get a free brownie..  we walked away with four. :)  After getting home, I bit into the burger and was pleasantly surprised at the taste.  The mushrooms, bacon, sauce.. the flavors were all over.  I really cant wait to go back here, it was that good.  So glad we tried this place and so glad it's close too!

Just recently joined this club  BIg fan of their weights area and love that they have a basketball court.  It's just down the street for me and the price was good.    My girlfriend and I love their shakes, but I wish they were consistant on how they make them. One day they are great, the next, not so much. Depends on who makes them.   Good location!

Im probably the only guy who will give a review of a woman's boutique...  But when you have a girlfriend with two daughters who have been wanting to come here for ever, it's worth seeing how excited they get.  So this place is roughly a ton of jewelry, purses, necklaces and a ton of other small trinket type things.  What's cool about it is that everything seems to be color coordinated.  So if you were looking for something black, they literally had a black section.. a yellow section.. a purple section, etc.   Very cool idea.  According to my girlfriend, the prices were ridiculously cheap.  She bought a purse and expected to pay $75, but it was only $25.    There are only a few locations that Ive seen.. one downtown and this location way up north.  Very cool and I know we're looking to bring the girls back here so they can pick a few things out.  For the guys.. they have a spot for us to sit in the back.  It was pretty funny seeing all the men hanging out on the side.

Ok, so the grand opening hasn't even happened yet for this place, but sorry Im gonna miss it.  Not...  A group of eight of us show up tonight for "dinner" and drinks.  We get seated way the hell in the back.  I guess we didn't fit in with the rest of the crowd.  Two graphic designers, three filmmakers, a photographer and some friends.. ok?  The reason I point this out is that the waiter lets us know that this place isn't that classy of a place like LeBoca, so the people are.. well... less classy? The guy was digging himself a hole.  So we order drinks, which seem to take about 10minutes to get to our table.  In the mean time we're looking at our menu and the waiter leaves again for about 10min... he finally shows up and we order from this tiny little menu.   My girlfriend and I order some tacos and chips with guacamole, everyone else orders something a bit similar.    Conversation is picking up while we wait for our food.  I see people coming and going and that's when we notice that our food is taking too damn long.  Finally after eating our small plate of chips and guacamole our food arrives. Probably about 45min later.  Here's the best part....  So the food shows up and after waiting for 45minutes, we get these tiny little tacos that look like they are from the menu of a 2 year old.  That's right.. each of the three tacos are literally two bites at most each.  Everyone eats their dinner in about 5minutes max..  pathetic.  After our tiny little dinner, we ask for our bills..The waiter doesn't think to bring all our bills at once, no.. instead he brings one or two at a time. Guess he wants us to stick around? Who knows.. Finally the two filmmakers get their bill, pay and they leave.. couple other of our friends do the same.  My friend and I stay with our other friend who's still waiting on his bill.  He gets it and notices that his $15 meal was just charged $30 on his credit card.  He complains and the waiter vanishes for about 20minutes to fix his card.  When he comes back he gives some crap about fixing it and giving him a credit.. guess how much? Oh about 50 cents..   He signed the slip and the remaining three of us left this crappy place.  The place actually does look pretty cool.  Too bad the service sucks and the food is barely appetizer quality at best.

Finally a big Chinese buffet that's good!!  A buddy and myself checked this place out last week and I couldn't be more happier.  Well I could, but I was very satisfied..  They had a huge assortment of foods from all your popular Chinese dishes to even a couple American ones.  Buffalo wings..! yum.  They even have a BBQ station.  I wasn't too impressed with it, so passed it up, but they also had some fresh Sushi for people to try out.    Would i go back? Oh heck yeah.  Very good food and service!

This place is so damn tasty.  I love a good burger and I recommend this place highly.  I don't know why I didn't give it 5 stars.. 4.5?  Ok, there we go.  I ordered a mushroom Swiss burger and the thing literally melted in my mouth. You have to be careful cause you could literally inhale these things in a matter of seconds.  They are that good!  A big plus that his place has is that they sell fried pickles.  I don't know of another small place like this that does.  Veddddy goood.    Thankfully this place is two blocks from my house, so easy access.. lol.

I don't think I've been to a Zipps I didn't like.  I'm a regular at their parent location called Goldie's.  This new location was a great spot. Awesome service, the food was delicious and fast.  Couldn't ask for anything more!

I've been here many times.  It's definitely a place where not everything is to my liking. I've heard raves how good their lasagna was and I ordered it one time and it just wasn't good at all.  Could be just my personal preference.  Last I was there I ordered their spaghetti and meatballs and for a simple dish, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was.  Their appetizers are really good and their desserts are pretty great too.     Service is always top notch here.

We have been here a few times before comedy shows and have always been happy with the service, drinks and food.  Copper Blues is a fairly large place that sits next to Stand Up Live.  One of the nice things is that you can buy a drink here and take it to SUL.  Though it doesnt count as your two drink minimum.    Their appetizers are pretty tasty.  We ordered their beef tips which were delicious and also an order of their wings.  The wings were ok, but nothing fancy.    My only beef would be that when a live rock band goes on, they forget that it's a restaurant/bar and crank the volume as if they were in a 20,000 person arena.  Over all good place and we always go here before a show.

I was recommended to go here from a friend.  Realizing it was just down the street from me, I headed over.  It's a tiny little joint that is easily missed if you're not looking for it.   Ordered their creme brulet burger and wow was it yummy.  If I had anything to say, I would say the meat could be a little more seasoned. Still great though!  I'd love to try a different burger next time just to try a variety.  One thing that blew me away was their french fries with BBQ seasoning on it.  Delish!  Good service and pretty quick too.

Ok, so Ive been here four times in the last few months and Ive got to say.. this is hands down, the best Tilted Kilt in the valley.    We've been going here because of Phoenix Comicon meetings we have downtown.  Which is awesome this place opened up..  Because last year we went to Majerles almost every day for lunch for Phoenix Comicon.  THIS will be our new place to hang out.    The food is great.  If you love sweet potato fries.. holy crap, you will love theirs.  Amazing!  The waitresses are wonderful and treat you with the most respect.  Of course they are eye candy and make the Hooter girls seem like nothing. TK knows how to hire beauty.  Even the guys are GQ quality.  Treat them with respect and you get it back. (meaning no oogling to the point you fall out of your chair) So I guess that's why we have a good time there. Drinks are plentiful and management always comes around to make sure you're doing well.    Just love this place and the atmosphere.  TIP: If you want an amazing view of the city, sit outside on the balcony!

Welcome to the Royale!  An awesome new theater that just opened in downtown Mesa.  A bunch of us went here tonight for their opening night of Hobo With A Shotgun and had a great time.  With the weather being a billion degrees, The Royale did a great job at keeping the movie watches nice and cool.  Great staff on hand and they had a nice variety of drinks and snacks from those retro days.  Can't wait to go back!

I have no had Firehouse three times in three weeks.  I can easily say that this is my new favorite place to get a sub.  Gone are the days of cold subs and bring in the hot subs. The best one I've had (so far) is the cheddar and brisket sub.  Mouth watering and though it's 8:30AM, I could eat one right now.    The service is great and they are always there to answer any question you have.  Can't wait for the next trip!

A bunch of us went on opening night for $2.  We waited about 2 hours roughly in line before getting inside.  I gotta say that the owners put a ton of money into this place and it definitely showed.  When walking in your a shown to the right where to pay your fee to get in.  Afterwards you walk up to a guy who is just standing there and doesn't say a word.  At first you're thinking that he's supposed to escort you down.  no.. you just walk around him.     Upon entering you start seeing tons of animatronic figures and even some recognizable creatures from movies like American Werewolf In London and even Fluffy from Stephen Kings Creepshow.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Through out the place you visit various rooms with some real people and a ton of robotic types moving around.    I didnt get scared one bit.. visually, I thought the place was awesome.  Here are my pros and cons...  Pros: Animatronics were very cool over all original. Tons of space to walk through Super cool and friendly staff. The museum part seems like it'll have great potential. Right down the street from everything cool in downtown Mesa!  Cons: Price.. unless they change it up often, I see people complaining about the $22. The people working weren't scary.. some stood there and just stared at you.   A few of the props like the big dinosaur displayed the crane that was holding. A big dragon head (I called it skeleton Falcor) showed the guy operating it because of the light shining on it.    If I had to suggest anything:  People love seeing stuff the recognize from film.  I noticed that the wolf from American Werewolf was up high and darkened, so  you don't see it unless you look up and close.  If there's anything popular that will draw people.. light those things up some so they stand out.   Id love to see more movie props once the museum opens up.  I heard the owner has a ton of props, so I'm looking forward to that.    When it comes to the haunted house part.. don't stop here.. keep coming up with ideas to creep people out.  I know I didn't get scared, but my girlfriend sure did.  Lots of jumping going on.  I would definitely go back here once the museum part opens.  I think the price is a big much, but I will pay to see how it looks.    I enjoyed it and cant wait to see how this evolves.

Went here to see a friends band and the place was just top notch.  Super friendly people and the music sounded great there.  it's a small place that looks like an old restaurant converted into a bar.  If you pass by the location you might miss it.  We were also hungry, so we ordered some nachos and a cheesecrisp.  Let me tell you what.. they do not hold back on the cheese.  I know some people might not like that, but wow it was delicious!  We stayed there for a while and saw people come and go, the drinks were flowin and over all just had a great time there.

My girlfriend and I had the joy of coming here for lunch one Sunday a few weeks ago and was blown away by this awesome place.  You walk in and the place is different from room to room. It feels straight out of Ireland!  I've never been, but it feels like it.. so yeah.  We sat outside because the weather was perfect.  I've been to a pub over in Tempe Marketplace (forgot the name) and was not impressed with their bland food.  This time I asked what was good just to make sure.   As we sat and looked at our menu, something caught my eye.  Black Pudding.  Being a fan of shows like Bizarre Foods and Anthony Bourdain.  I knew what that was and it was time to try it.  I told my girlfriend what it was and she said she'd try it.  For those who dont know what that is.. it's Blood Sausage.. yep.   I LOVED IT!  ...she hated it. lol.  I finished it off with some crackers and some sauce.  Just tasty stuff!  We split a sandwich and a salad for our main course.  This place was just wonderful and I cant wait to go back!

Girlfriend recommended this place last week.  We haven't had Italian for quite a while.  The place is small on the outside but quite spacious on the inside.    I checked us both in and was told the wait would be 10-15min.  In about 8min, we were sat down.  "Sorry for the wait"  Are you kidding? That was quick!   We're used to waiting a long time for a nice restaurant.  We were seated in a nice table and greeted quickly by our server Adam.  Hello, great service!!  Adam was friendly and knew what was good. Not having been there, I asked if I should try the baked ziti or beef stroganoff.  He said beef stroganoff, but both were great.  I ordered the stroganoff and my girlfriend ordered the lasagna.  We ordered some garlic bread that was out of this world.  The perfect soft center with a crispy out side. Delish!  We got our food pretty fast.  I had to try the lasagna, as I am a big snob when it comes to that.  Damn was it good!  My dish was just as great as he mentioned.  It was so good that I actually ate the left overs the next day.  I don't do that often!   Adam was great through out the dinner. Kept our drinks filled and asked how our food was.  I highly recommend people sit in his section.  We will be back!

For years I've been looking for a place to eat that I could consider healthy.  I work right next to this location and have seen the "Coming Soon" sign for a while.  When it finally opened, it took me a while but I finally tried. it.  When you first walk in, the staff is beyond nice.  I was the only one in there when they first opened, but was greeted by literally, 10 people.  I even made a comment about everyone being there. I felt like a King!  Never have eaten here, I asked what was popular and what was good.  The girl  was great because when i said "its ok to be honest.." She was.   She recommended a salad and said I could customize to how I wanted.  There's a place in Chandler that I loved and I recreated the same salad from that place.  She nailed it.  The salad was perfect and when you go pay for your food they even throw a chocolate covered strawberry in with your meal.  How cool is that?  My only beef with the place.. and actually it's not the place is that it tends to bring in the snobby people in.   I had a near bump in with some guy who had placed is cup in front of me.. I had no idea it was there and said excuse me.  He grunted and gave me this look.  Wow.. ok man.  Chill out.  So if you want great sandwiches and salads.  I highly recommend Cafe Zupas.  Love this place and I will definitely be back.

Not impressed at all.  From what I hear is that each America's Taco Shop is individually owned and each one is a new experienced.  My girlfriend told me about the one they go to in Tempe and had raved how great it was.  Today we went to this location.  We walk in and scan the menu and notice... no tacos... Their digital menu wasnt working right and was still showing the breakfast menu.  The girl didnt offer any paper menus, because they didnt have any.  What eatery (besides fastfood) doesn't have a menu??)  We ordered the guacamole trio with chips and a few tacos.  The meat was pretty dry on the tacos and if it wasn't for the ton of salsa and guac, they would have been pretty bland.    Spending $30 for lunch, I was not happy.  The only thing that made it two stars was that they had happy hour and we got a few tiny $1 burros.. they were hot with cheese and were ok.    Won't be coming back here.

My girlfriend and I hit this place up during the Horror & Sci-Fi Film festival this weekend.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and she picked up a regular cheese burger with onions and mushrooms.  ..also grabbed a small fry.  I gotta say the taste of these burgers are absolutely delicious.  Just juicy as can be.  The fries are great too, but I recommend getting the small.. plenty of food.  I loved that all the condiments are free to put on the burger.  My only gripe is that they dont tell you how big the burgers are.  After getting our food, we both realized that we could have split one big burger or each have gotten a jr burger.    Loved the taste of this place and would most definitely go back here and chow down.

Remember when you'd try all those chinese food places and they were all just OK?  Qwik is beyond that.    My girlfriend and I decided to check this place out since it's on our way home.  We were so happy we did!  Here's what I love about some restaurants.. I like when they stick to the basics.  Nothing weird and fusion type foods, nothing you've never heard of.  I'm a pretty basic foodie (though I do love the occasional change!). The flavors of all that we had from Qwik were just amazing.    Of course with food being so good I do tend to stuff myself.. Argg.. Yeah.. The stomach ache was worth it!  We will be back!

I am usually the "chain" guy and stick to what I know.  This past friday we hit Bink's for happyhour.  This was my first time, and let me say.. far from last time, that we hit this place.  I was floored by the quality of food and beverages.   From what I learned, all the food ingredients comes from the local markets and all the beer is Arizona branded. The service was great, we got our food in a timely manner and sitting outside in the beautiful weather was the perfect touch.  Can't wait to go back!

Ive never been a huge fan of this place.  Buffalo Wild Wings is good for one thing.. their wings.  However I was pretty disappointed in the wings this time.  Im a dry rub person when they are available.  Tasted like their wings were cooked way too long.  So they were not great.  Best Buffalo Wild Wings was the one of Scottsdale 101... but they closed and are another sports bar.

I do understand the hype!  This place is definitely not for the average shopper. It's a a trend setting hipster store that's beautiful on the outside and inside.  Their eateries range from pizza, sandwiches to BBQ, a big ass salad bar and some asian dining, you can't go wrong.    I'll admit, that I dont buy groceries here because they are quite expensive, but regardless still a pretty cool environment.   They also have two different juice type bars when you walk in so you've got to try both.

I never thought I'd say this about Fired Pie... but I think this is the best pizza I have ever had.  Hands down.  Thin crust is my favorite.  Along with fresh ingredients, wonderful flavors and a great price; you can't beat this.  I had a tried a place like this at USC in CA and this destroys that one.  Fired Pie is top notch!

I'm basing my review of my visit.  I've been a big fan of the wings at Native from their Chandler location and Bell Rd. off the 17.  I was so excited to see they were opening one up right down the street from me.    When I called my order in, i could tell the girl on the other end was new.  So I made sure to say everything slowly and precise.  She then told me she was writing the order down and will put it in the computer after the manager was done with something.   I walked in and they couldn't find my order right away.  They found it written on a tablet next to the register.  Luckily it was only a few minutes and my wings were ready to go.  Once I got home I opened them all excited to eat my favorite juiciest greasiest yummy Asiago Parmesan wings.  Sadly though... it looked as if they just grabbed some wings that just got done and dusted the Parmesan on them.  I actually had to use the ranch dressing..(something I never do with those wings).  I'm used to the wings being super dripping with (i know it sounds gross) grease and oil from the asiago and the Parmesan is all clumped up and coated all over.    They weren't like this at all.. I had plain wings with a little Parmesan on them.   :(

If God opened up a BBQ place in Heaven, it would be called Little Miss BBQ.  This place is keeps me speechless.  We now have a group of 10+ people who go here once a month.    I first heard of this place when some friends came by our work with leftovers and said "Hey try this.."  I was floored..  Two weeks later, we came by for our first trip.  I was never a brisket person until this place.  Standing in line, the guy behind the counter would cut small pieces for us to try.  Mind blow...  Since then that is all I get.  This last time I got a full pound of brisket for lunch!!  I couldn't believe how easy it was to eat all of it.  I mixed it up with fatty and lean brisket.  Though, I do prefer the fatty.    This place is just insane with flavors. If you haven't been here, GO NOW!  Just stop reading this, jump in your car and GO!.

I really enjoy their wings.  Unfortunaterly that's where it ends with this place.  I have no problem going here, but I usually expect less than ok service here.  The last few times I've been here, the hostess was always pleasant and sat us promptly. The server will come over all friendly asking us for our drink order, a few minutes later we'll order the food.. and that's where we seem to lose our server.  This has happened a few times now.  It's like once they drop the food off, we are no longer their customers.    I love eating at a place where they are always checking on you to make sure all is good, the drinks are filled, so much that you are left saying "wow, they really want to make sure all is good!"  Not so much here.  Food was good, though they did try to screw me out of 6 extra wings on my order.  I had to count the wings and got a "Oh.. that's weird.. I'll go check"

I wish I could give Fired Pie 10 stars.  Unfortunately I cannot.  This place always delivers.  Whichever location I have been to, I have not been disappointed.   I get the same thing every visit and with each visit, I am reminded of why I keep coming back.  The food is so addicting!  Also helps that they serve Pepsi products.  Girlfriend wasn't happy when they moved from Coke to Pepsi.  Ahh well.  Keep opening more of these wonderful establishments and I will visit them all!

I volunteer with the Phoenix Film Festival each year and when we saw this place open we were pretty excited.  The owners have been more than welcoming to everyone that has been in there and continue to do so with each visit.   I LOVE their food.  My recent favorite was the Lucky's Phoenix Dog with a side of Louisana Cajun Waffle Fries.  You can't go wrong there!   The atmosphere is great and if you've lived in Arizona your whole life, you will see some great memories on the walls.  I just live down the street so I try to eat here once every week or so.  Highly recommend it!

This is definitely one of the cool new places I have had the joy to discover.  Services was great and their food options were wonderful.  I highly recommend their pretzel bites.  Delish!

Went here last night after some suggestions from friends and family.  Very cool place.  It was a bit loud when we got there because the Women's soccer team just won the World Cup. Makes sense lol.    Sat in a nice booth near the back and drinks were ready within a few minutes.  I got their Juicy Lucy, which is a cheddar burger that has the cheese melting on the inside.  I got fries on the side.    The burger wasn't a large burger, but definitely had the charred grilled thing goin and personally I love that.  I probably could have done without the tomato and lettuce as it seem to make it a little hard to eat.  The fries were good, but nothing super innovated.    We enjoyed and I look forward to trying something else next time.

So glad they finally reopened up this location.  We were here on opening night and have been back probably 4-5 times.  So good!  We are big fans of the food here and I have decided it's time to break away from my normal two rolled taco meals and try new things.  I have!  Service is always great and their chips and salsa is delish!

The seats are the best part of the theatre.  The self service is a pain and not the easiest to figure out if you're new.  Dirty popcorn all over the place and the smell in the air is that of mechanical and burnt popcorn.  Pretty disgusting AMC.
