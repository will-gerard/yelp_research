She was about to give the next table to another guy,  when L stepped in and said something.  She had the nerve to tell that guy, oh sorry ihave to say summertime else first, I'll tell you why later.  Really? Are you twelve? And right in front of us? Really great customer service. She needs to go because she can't handle the pressure. Why they don't invest in those buzzers for these events.  Not very happy. .. we come here quite a bit and his family is here every Monday. I'll flag manager down, if I can. I had to downgrade my rating this time. Food rocks, but they need to reassess their Hostess.

I LOVE this place. Never a bad experience! The food is great, I haven't had everything, as I do not like spicy foods.  Everything from the fish&chips to the spinich salad to the french dip always great and very consistent. The water is the best in town, which is rare. The patio is always full, you will have to wait for a table out there, but it's worth it.   This is a first rate place!

This place never fails me. And a bonus, Odelay! Is on tap, is a beautiful Mexican chocolate beer. Now I wish I had some chocolate to go with it.

This place is consistent, friendly and clean.  Love the food, music is authentic, just wish they served a mild salsa for chips.

This is s great little place off Central in Phoenix. Modern decor and a nice patio. W started with the hummus platter, very fresh and just the right amount of garlic, puts bread was amazing. This place has a drink special everyday. Tuesday was $3 martinis, the first 5 on the list anyway. Very good, full sized and fresh fruit, I tried the apricot, lemon and dark chocolate, all delish!  The Casablanca chicken was great and they adopted the bun for me and wrapped it in lettuce. Carolyn's strawberry and blueberry salad looked good and she couldn't stop eating it....  Going to check out the brunch on Sundays.

We haven't been here in a long while.  Not impressed, most of the food is cold. Crab legs have no taste or just taste gross.  Terriyaki chicken was dry as was the sweet &sour chicken, pork ribs too fatty.  Not coming back.

Was not impressed with the food at all. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which came out barely warm and with almost no BBQ sauce. I had to ask for more sauce. The bun was so wet, like it had been sitting for a while, that I couldn't even pick up the sandwich. I used a fork. I also ordered the sweet potato tots, which I had to send back because they were mushy. Lonnie ordered the fish and chips, which he liked, but wasn't impressed. So far no other place match's Four Peaks when it comes to fish and chips. You really had to search for a reasonable meal, some items were too high for a bar. Wouldn't eat there, but it has a nice atmosphere for drinking, and large tables for groups meeting up.

Horrible!  Service was way slow, waitress was I in another world, tells in salsa and drinks took forever.  I order the fish tacos, asked for sour cream instead of the spicy sauce they use. First off, there was so much sour cream, the disk was literally swimming in it. The amount of fish was ridiculous for the price of the meal ($11), I wish I had taken a photo of it.  It wasn't seasoned and had no taste.  Oh, and the ice tea was nasty.  Manager gave us a free appetizer for our next visit but we went be back.

We got a Groupon NOW! and checked this place out on Sunday.  The atmosphere is modern, with lots of T.V.'s, large booths and a huge patio.  My burger was cooked perfectly, had lot's of flavor. The shoe string fries were crispy, but the sweet potato fries were average, not salted and not very crispy. The water tasted so good, I didn't need a lemon! ( note to other resturants, water matters )  I noticed a coupla other reviews that ranked the food as average.  Maybe off days? I'm pretty picky eating out and am not afraid to say it.  The red wine list actually has more then just a Cab and Merlot!  The list was a good size and prices were standard.  Service was really good, this place was clean and very friendly.  I want to go back and check out the salads, and the Happy Hour looks great!

Always consistent food. Although my chicken Mongolian was lacking in chicken.. Way too many mushrooms. I ordered it to go, and sat too eat a bit, and I had no napkin or fork. I would have been really upset when I got back to work with them missing from my bag. It I'd to go, isn't that a normal thing to add?

I also get a fab puedo and mani here, techs are great! My French tips always last for weeks. Cuticles are done really good. Polish too. They always have specials even though it's been a while since I've been in here, they always recognize me.

Ordered the turkey wIth bacon on regular bread. I can't eat the whole thing, it's got great flavor. I would back and try the chicken salad. The salads look really good, so that's an option for another day. Vanilla shake was good too.

W live in the neighborhood and cine here often, betty good consistent food. However, the young lady at the register never smiles. Ever. Makes me uncomfortable, maybe keep her in the beck instead of helping customers?

Changed it up today and got a nectar. Very good. Pasta salad is just sweet enough. Friendly staff. Must get a cookie or baked good, Jodi (owner) is a wonderful baker.

I'm now just enjoying the half sandwiches, I was too full and sleepy after lunch.   Very fresh and wonderful as always. This place is consistent. Stop going to Jimmy John's, try his place out. There's one on Via Linda too.

So I got to try this truck today at work. I got the burger and I wasn't disappointed. I'm a wimp so I had them take off the green chilies. Cooked perfect, grilled onions were sweet and the slaw was great. I would've liked a little pepper on it though! I'll be stopping by whenever I see this truck!

This truck rolled into our work parking lot today, I love paninis. I got the turkey and I love the flavor, but for $9.50 I expected more than two thinly sliced pieces of turkey. I had to open the sandwich to find the meat. Wouldn't go back.
