I should have known better based on other reviews--learn from my mistakes!  Customer service: 1 star. The dude who took my delivery order was really rude. Whatever.  Speed: 1 star. 50 minutes to deliver on a Monday afternoon, but still, that seems to be the norm based on other reviews.  Taste: 0 stars. Gross. I ordered the Orange Tofu, General Tso's Tofu, and Egg Fried Rice. The sauce of both of the tofu dishes were really similar, like they just added more soy sauce to the General Tso's. Both sauces were really gelatinous  and just tasted really low quality. I also felt terrible after I ate them.   Just don't.

I split the spicy hummus with a friend and didn't even finish it, for ten bucks you get a decent amount. I'm a vegetarian but they're FEZ Veggie Burger didn't sound appealing so I ordered the traditional FEZ Burger sub black bean patty and it was DELICIOUS. Such an interesting combination of flavors that mix together so well. I suggest ordering the sweet potato fries to go with it.  4/5 stars because the service sucked. It took us nearly 30 minutes to get our drink order. I'm pretty sure the sever was new, but she should have asked for help because  the wait and quality of service was ridiculous.Overall, the delicious burger was worth it.

I got the shrimp skewers and my boyfriend got the chicken skewers. Both were delicious. Beers were 50 cents which was great. The outside patios are cool, the inside ambiance could be a bit . Overall it was great and affordable.

I've been a few times, and overall the atmosphere has been very chill without too many rowdy ASU students.   Service in the dining area was a little off-- orders were forgotten--but the place is new enough so I understand.   The food is delicious, they serve Orion, and have a great selection of sake and are very knowledgeable and eager to let you sample, especially if you sit at the bar.  The owners and staff are all really cool and I love that I can go after midnight on the weekends. I just wish it were a bit cheaper.

My boyfriend and I came during HH so beers were a dollar off. They have a great selection of local craft beers as well as some Latin American ones.  We started with the Combo Caribe appetizer which was delicious and well worth $7. I can't decide if the yuca frita or tostones were my favorite (but that's okay because you get a generous portion of all three choices).We each ordered two empanadas.   I got the bean and cheese (classic, nothing too crazy) and the achiote (different but delicious). Both were delicious--seasoned well and nice and flaky.  My boyfriend got the jalape√±o popper and the republica chicken. Both were excellent, definitely  try the popper!  All in all, 4 beers, 4 empanadas, and an appetizer for $30. Most excellent.

Service can be a bit flaky--there were only two servers on when I got there (6:30 on a Saturday) and it took a long time for anyone to help me/the staff seemed overwhelmed. I still love this place, just some info for the powers that be.

The seafood was fresh and delicious and the customer service  was awesome. The manager gave us samples of one of their cocktails and their spicy edamame and their sushi chef gave us a sample of the smoky salmon which was my favorite dish of the night. We felt very welcomed and had a great time. Prices were actually pretty lower than most sushi places as well.
