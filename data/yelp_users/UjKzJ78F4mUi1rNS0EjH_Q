Consistantly delicious! Have been going to this joint since it was actually in the now renovated WalMart section of this corner. Can not go in without having at least one vegas roll. Their rainbow roll is also a classic and fresh staple. Their Glendale roll is amazing as well!  The cucumber salad is a nice starter. Although it ain't as good as it used to be their miso soup is still pretty darn good! Great sake/beer specials! They also have special rolls for the day; a great place to go have your favorites or try something new!

I definitely recommend Four Peaks for any beer lover who visits the valley, in my opinion our best brewery in Phoenix. Although it has become more of a restaurant than brewpub when they removed the pool table/relaxing area and made more seating; it's still a great place to sit and talk, catch up with old(or make new) friends, or watch the game.  The Raj IPA is my personal favorite but Kiltlifer and HopKnot are other local favorites. First time there? Get their sampler and decide for yourself, their seasonals are also excellent! Happy hour (regular and reverse) are definitely the time to go for $ deals, but be warned this is a popular hangout for regulars.  Four Peaks food was a lot better a couple of years ago, but their flavors are still well done. My fav starter or small bite is their spinach-artichoke dip that comes with beer bread (small pita bites made with beer) and tortilla chips. Perfect to share with one or two people. My favorite main dish is the salmon BLT but check out their specials online ahead of time before heading in, these are usually delicious things you can't find on the menu.  Another thing that's not on their menu is grilled cheese. I know, as simple as it may seem theirs is delicious and goes great with their soup of the day for something a little less filling. Don't forget to add avacado and tomoato!  Also, they do brunch on the weekends. Used to just be for holidays that fell on those days but now it seems to be a usual thing. Haven't been in awhile but from what I remember it's special dishes or buffett style. You chose. See you there!

Can not say enough good things about this place! Like many people below, Sail Inn is like a second home to me. I was really sad to discover it after moving out of Tempe but find myself heading back there any night I'm off and need a night out.  Their calendar online may seem a little bland but this place is the place to check out local (and some not so local) music. What first got me in the door was Ragae Thursdays, which to my knowledge have been changed to Funk Thursdays, which makes me just as happy. People here know how to appreciate and participate in good music, so if you've been looking for a place to get down and meet good people look no further-the Sail is for YOU! Great drink specials and bartenders! I tend to go for the mini-pitchers of beer or a heavy glass of wine, but if when I'm wanting to try something new the bartenders are happy to offer me up something. One warning, they do have a $10 minimum on their card running for the bar and when the line-up is heavy there is a cover. So cash is a friendly advocate here. I've met many good friends here and always look forward to my next visit...Sail Inn, stumble out.

Yes, I will agree with some of the other posters in that Casey's has a definite crowd and can be a little pretentious at times but over all it's a fun place to be. Enjoy the scene if you're into it and if not enjoy the people watching. Maybe if we all just smiled a little bit, those hipsters wouldn't be so emo...haha, just kiddin. I've gone in to Casey's and attempted to meet new people; been looked at like a crazy and also have met some cool ones as well. It's location is close to many things in Tempe, which makes it a favorite spot for bike riders. Ride your favorite two-wheeled friend down there and strike up a convo with other enthusiasts, because a bike friendly world is a happy world.   I've never really had any problems with the staff, minus pouring me too stiff of drinks(their Irish coffee especially). It does tend to get extremely crowded nights on the weekends which can lead to slower service but that's what good company is for. Head inside to the bar, grab your first round, find a seat out on their wonderful patio and wait for your waiter for the next round. simple.   I don't really dig their food too much. I feel they dress it up saying it's an "oyster house" but really its just bar food. I tend to eat at home or somewhere else and just have this as a drinking joint. Otherwise I feel greasy and gross afterwards. I will say their portions are good enough to share.

I usually steer-clear of places that are rumored to have a long ass wait but my Mama selected this place for her birthday brunch, needless to say it was a yummy breakfast. We got there around 815 and were seated around 9, so if youre being leisurely, its worth the wait.  The menu is small and concise, making it somewhat easy to decide; it all looks and sounds so good. But it's all pretty basic meals with a couple of daily specials. One of which I had; scrambled eggs, jalapenos, cheese, onions, and a shit ton of delicious, partnered with home-fries and a tortilla. The jalapenos were just right and so fresh! We also had tried some of the walnut, raisin bread toast; which was fantastic. My boyfriend had the waffle which was good but I could tell he could use another one ($8 for one waffle?). I don't eat swine too often but the bacon was heavenly; thick and peppered. One thing I do regret about the meal was I saw someone order some chocolate milk, definitely should've got some instead of coffee; what's the rush to wake up on a Sunday anyway?  When we came out, some people who had been waiting near us, were asking what we got and how it was. It seemed our leaving Matt's got everyone outside's mounths watering. Everyone lit up to hear our reviews, which I thought was pretty funny...So all-in-all it was good but nothing so amazing (which is what I've heard about this place). Great for a special occasion or once in awhile.

I had been waiting to come in here for quite sometime now. My brother is a big fan and my good friend Steph has been recently praising it's glory. So we went in for lunch today. I had looked online at the website ahead of time at the menu and was impressed with the beer list, as well as the selection of pasties. I was expecting it to be all chicken-pot-pie and shepards pie but it was not the case. It's a very skinny joint with a small amount of seating. I did notice towards the back a booth, which would be great for a big group but parties of 2-4 is probably best. We started off with some beers, which was nice because the pasties take about 20 minutes to cook. Just enough time to quench your thurst and may I just say any place that can make a black velvet (not too many) from there draft is directly put on to my favs. I  appreciate it! I had the Chicken Takki Masala pasty. It was delicious! Perfectly spicy and flavorful, the colors were also fantastic! I did however wish there was more chicken it it, which was cooked and spiced to perfection (the potatoes were as well but the chicken was just wonderful).  Steph had the Greek Chicken pasty which was also delicious. I think next time I'll get one of those for myself. I will definitely be heading back here! Not only was the food good, but they had great tunes on, great service, and good-looking cooks!

Being a native Phoenician I have attended many shows at the Clubhouse Music Venue in Tempe; winter, summer, sold-out, very few people, weeknights, and weekends. Although they tend to get a variety of music acts rolling through there, the sound always leaves something to be desired or the listeners deaf. For many years, being underage, I was forced to stand in the front, which can give a great experience being that the speakers are in your face, you're surrounded by others who are so "into" it they actually dance, and (when I was 17) be able to "make eye contact" with the guy who is usually serenading you in your bedroom on your boom-box. Now that I'm older and don't like to sing along to every word but actually play music myself and am more interested in what they are doing, the sound, and environment it gets a little hard to be so easily gratified. In the back, where I can actually hold my drink and check things out, you can hear anything but vocals; such a turn off! Another reason I'm standing in the back, is there are SO many people in there I feel claustrophobic just looking at the mass of people ahead of me. On that note, there is no AC, none at all. Clubhouse, step it up and put down on some AC. I think I saw some fans set around the bar too, that weren't even on. Lastly, no one likes to move in the back. We're all kind of in the lights of the bar, making it hard for those who are there to see and be seen stop talking and starring and start actually appreciating the reason they came (music). Oh and one more thing $6 for a miller lite from a bucket of ice (cash only) or $4 for a tall boy of red stripe (through the mass of people waiting at the understaffed bar)...enough said.

I too am also a fan of other FOX concept resturaunts but Sauce was extremely disappointing. Had seen the location at the Scottsdale Water Front but never seemed enticed enough to enter until the other night. My cousin and I met up at a central location and unfortunately this seemed like the best option in the Norterra lot.  He had a pizza, which for my opinion are over-priced for their quality and size. Their menu doesn't span much taste-buds but can get any general idea of a "classy" pizza across. It was burnt and too crispy, even for just a plan pepperoni and cheese, it was boring.  Torn between wanting some pizza and a salad, I ordered their "greek"ish salad which was pretty good. Although it was delicious, the salad was way to rich to eat entirely by one's self.    I was mostly turned off by their service of wine in what appeared to be a juice cup. Maybe thats fine for my kitchen but thats at home where it doesn't cost per glass. My Mom informed me later that in a juice cup is actually how they drink it ususally across the Atlantic. hmp, didn't know that.   All in all, don't think I'll be getting sauced with Sauce again.

Yummy Yummy!   Had heard about this place not only being delicious but that it was started by a woman who came her across the boarder as an immigrant. With all the hubbub about immigrants these days, its sad to say that this place (amongst many others) wouldn't be here if it weren't for the blessed peeps who come over here and share not only their love but food and culture with all of us gringos who don't got nothing! I love the patio, I'm just missing the beach in front of me (instead of 7th street), especially because I've got a negro modelo in my hand, munching on some chips and (AWESOME) salsa.   I ordered a carne asada taco and one cob of America's corn. Both were delicious! Although I was stuffed with it all, I think I could eat at least two tacos, they're pretty cute and small. The corn was amazing and the sauce the came with it was kind of sweet at first but by then end my mouth was on fire (in a good way). I LOVED IT! Jose got the quesadilla with carne. It was also delicious but small for $6. That was his problem "I paid $6 for that small thing, I could make it at home". Which, yes, is true but you didn't and its yummy.    The staff we're friendly and genuinely nice. Great music was on the speakers and it was extremely clean. Everything taste and smelled fresh and it just felt very comfortable.  Saturdays & Sundays they have $2 pacificos, ALL DAY! I've got a girlfriend coming into town in a couple of weeks, I guess I know where we will be hangin out at.  Thanks America!

I take back my first review of Scramble. Last time I went with my Aunt, Mother, and Grandmother and had shared with them (and after my Grandma opened the topic to the bus-gal), that I was annoyed they used so much Styrofoam and other wasteful products. I believe last time the only way to not use non-recyclable dishware and utensils was to bring your own. This time, they still had disposable drink cups but I was very happy to see they were now a light plastic. I was soooo happy!  I got an egg sandwich, minus the ham and on a enflish muffin rather than sourdough bread. It was fantastic! Like a dream in my mouth. Cooked to perfection! I could've easily shared this with another diner, which was my first thought, but after one bite I just couldn't stop. Loved it.  My only one criticism is the employee who greeted us and took our order wasn't very warm or welcoming. She cut me off like 3 times and repeated things in a very annoyed tone. Hey, it's not my fault you are hung over and work at a breakfast place.  Overall, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.

everytime I go there is something delicious to be had.  went this past week to "break up" with my room mates and the mango yogart with fruity pebbles on top was extremely delicious; made the whole "i just don't think we're a good match"(when really I'm thinking I REALLY hate living with you, get me out ASAP) talk a LOT easier and faster and more understanding.  In fact, when I had finally gotten home that night (they drive, I ride), we had some wine...haven't hung out with them, well, since before I moved in.  Although I avoid Mill usually, Mojo you made my life a tad bit easier this week...thanks.

Totally love this place. Visited it on a Friday after work with my parents, brother, and boyfriend. We were greeted warmly and quickly, put on the wait list and escorted to the outdoor patio which was busy. As we waited, my Mom, bro and myself shared a delicious and refreshing bottle of a white blend wine. I'm not a huge fan of whites but on a hot afternoon, it was fantastic. We weren't even finished with our first glasses and we were seated at a nice little table near the front windows. Although it was a little tight for 5 people, a bottle (and ice tub) of wine, and then tons of food to follow; our waitress made it comfortable and kept us all happy! It was great!  To start we shared the pub board and a plate of some of the delicious bruschetta; brie with apples and fig spread, warm artichoke spread, white bean and chopped tomato, and the fresh mozzarella,tomato and basil. The pretzels were mouth watering, buttery and salty. A Sierra Nevada mustard came along with and was just spicy enough. All of the bruschetta was delicious but the apple and fig, as well as the white bean and tomato both stood out. Different ideas and tasty unique flavors together. Great combinations!  For our main course, we shared some sandwiches; my brother and Mother had the Tuna, while my boyfriend and I had the prosciutto with brie. This also had the fig on it and I couldn't get enough of it! My Pops had the raspberry chicken salad, which was also delicious.   We didn't have dessert but we did have a bottle of the wine on tap. It was a white (once again, not a huge drinker of white, so I'm not sure what kind) that was again, delicious. It was very crisp, had some bubble to it and wasn't too heavy on the honey flavor; what I deam my theory on white wines (they all taste a bit like honey).  Although I've never visited the original in Arcadia, I will definitely head back here in the future (especially because I work south of Camelback on Central!!! Thanks Postinos!

Had read some great reviews on here before trying it out myself. It's location is what I had looked for, because its not too far from Central and quite easily accessible by bus (yea, I ride it).  Being it was my first time I definitely got to take advantage of the first time price, which is a GREAT deal! But I ended up having her do more while I was there so I ended up paying for the actual cost of the Brazilian (why I went there).  I was penciled in with Amy and she was great. All the staff was very friendly and easy to have a conversation with. Amy was very gentle and I would definitely head back there.

Oh boy where do I begin.  First off, my Mom and I accidently entered through the bar, which got me really excited because there is a TON of beers on draft. Being a beer LOVER my mouth started watering in anticipation of having a nice tall glass. Once we finally made it up to the front, found our party, and were seated; I opened the menu only to find to my disappointment that draft beers are $6 a pint!!! REDICULOUS! My mother seems to think I've been stuck in Tempe and Phoenix for too long but I just think $6 for a beer, is INSANE! ...so I decided to protest by getting a Root beer.  I have to say, I'm not the biggest fan of pizza in the first place, so I come in a little bias. But, my cousin Zach, who was with me, LOVES pizza. I had combed over the menu and mostly out of pure inability to make a decision (extreme lack of sleep and beer after a long day of work and a movie), decided to just go in on the pizza with everyone. Nothing else on the menu seemed to appetizing and there wasn't a whole lot of people eating there either; so there was little visual or smell stimulations. We ordered the white pizza, the hot potato (which scared me, too many starches), and the Hawaiian. The white was boring, as well as the Hawaiian and both had been battered with way too much olive oil before hitting the oven. The Hot potato, which I actually thought would be disgusting, was actually not so bad...with a little Tabasco. And because we had only seen our waiter when we got our drinks, made our order, got the pizza, and paid the bill- I had to go get the Tabasco from the waiters station myself.   Finally it seems I am about to get home and sleep in a pizza (soon to be heartburn) coma, as we're getting the check but it took our waiter (for some reason) about 15 minutes to process it. There are other people in the mellow mushroom but none in our general vicinity. As we're waiting I'm watching the cooks in the back (they have an open kitchen-which is a cool idea); once, twice, three times I see 3 different cooks wipe their runny ass nose down their fore-arms, just stopping before it hits their hand or glove. YIKES! Next I see a bag of store-bought pitas sitting on the counter; which makes me happy I didn't get the humus. Lastly, as our waiter finally comes out with the check, the door to the kitchen swings open to reveal what appears to be two of the wait staff publically displaying their love.  Perhaps if I was a teen looking to impress some just 21's or guys who like teens, I'd hang out there. Perhaps if I had a ton of cash and didn't care how I wasted it, I'd hang out there. Perhaps, if I (for some God-forsaken reason) lived in the north valley in my pre-20's I think it was cool to hang out at a place where my fellow Gauchos (GCC) worked. But I'm not and I don't. Trust me, I LOVE me some mushrooms and I consider myself somewhat mellow, but Mellow Mushroom does not have it goin on.

Oh, I had such high hopes for the Living Room. Had heard amazing things of it and was really looking forward to a nice, long dinner date out on the town with my man (which for some peeps like us, is rare).   Didn't happen.  When we walked in there were three people who were running around and when we asked if we can just sit where we like or what, responded "well we have a group of 30 coming in so maybe over there somewhere" and points to the already crowded bar. We took seat at a 4 top, which seems ackward to me if they're expecting a large group. As we sat down, a large party of 6 or so who had been sitting on the couches (the now reserved area for the party of 30), moved near us; and soon one other group of 4 did the same. We were soon surrounded and listening to what appeared to be (from the sound of ridiculously loud laughter) hilarious stories from the people in their party.   Finally our waiter comes over and asks what we want to drink. No mention of the specials clearly written on the blackboard next to us (we had to ask him about the sliders and bottle special). No suggestions, nothing. I got a glass of wine and my noveo, a coke. Waiter returns with flat coke for noveo and an empty glass for me which he returns then again with a small container of wine and literally dumps the wine into the wine glass, practically spilling onto the table.   We ordered a 3 cheese plate and some classic mozzarella and the prosciutto bruschetta, after not being very impressed with the limited menu. I was a bit confused because one friend who recommended it to me said they have this amazing brie fondue and pretzels. The waiter was nice enough to leave one menu behind incase we wanted more food, I didn't see the front page of the menu until I was about half-way done with my wine. I know, hello Capitan obvious but still. It was disappointing.   Our food arrives and he throws the platters down on the table. No presentation at all. I asked him to refill my water twice while we were eating. For some reason, I was thirsty...who would think, a person thirsty while eating? The food was pretty tasty but I can get similar platters at just about any other joint downtown. While we're about  1/2 through our meal, the large group who came over near us moved back to the couches, apparently the group of 30 wouldn't be coming in.  By the time we finished our two plates, we were still a little hungry but we had had enough of the neglectful service, we were done. It took him a well 15 minutes to get me some change for the bill and he didn't give me proper change, so considering the service, homeboy got a smaller tip.   I can see where the owners were going with this one but the only thing really 'living room' about it was that I could see the toilet from my table and I can imagine from any other seat in the house.
