Doug did a great job on my Tag. It took longer then expected but was not his fault. Fixed it and polished it like new. I highly recomend him.

I very much enjoy listening to Bruce St James. Very funny and comes up with some great points. Reminds me a lot of Adam Carolla who I miss very much.

Love this place. Kinda hard to find but well worth it. This one has no alcohol and herd somewhere they will soon. If you want to eat it at home, its better to call and pick it up then delivery. Delivery takes much longer.

Been coming here for years and it never disappoints. I've tried many different desert oyster places around here and I must say this is my favorite. Very fresh and large oysters. Also love getting the shrimp plater. Nice and big. Large selection of beer and all at a great price.

Absolutly great hotel. I'm from nearby Tempe and I still stay here a few times a year. I get the suite with the tub and me and my girl have a great staycation. Summer time is my favorite. Pool is average. Best part is that its considered a adult hotel. No effen screaming kids in the pool. I highly recommend this hotel

being a big fan of four peaks I had to give this place another try. The hummus was awfull, definitely out of a tub. Orderd a hamburger and the bun looked like someone sat on it. Beer is good and I like there selections of IPAs. That's about all they got going for them. If they were just a restaurant they would be out of business.

Always have the baseball steak. A cut that isn't always appreciated. Med rare is what I always request. Can't say I have ever had a bad one here. Had the lobster during lob. month last Sep and was delish. A week later had it at San Tan and it sucked. So it veries from place to place if u ask me. I'll stick with Tempe.

Started with the hot pot seafood soup. Not good. The seafood itself wasn't bad but Tiff thought the broth tasted like dirty dish water with a hint of lemon dawn. We enjoyed the drunken noodles with shrimp and the pad thai was awesome. Saki was weird, too sweet. Service could've been better and the heat was set at about 90Â°. All in all It's a great place, just skip the soup!

Was working in the neighborhood and seen all the good reviews and had to check it out. Was well worth it. Had the pork burrito and it was fenominal. The guacamole was made when you order and was great. I will be back.

Got to say caffeine drinks and alcohol is how I make it thru my day. To find a place that has both and happy hour too, I'm in! This one has whisky and a GREAT selection of IPAs. Love this place!

I Can't go wrong with Bww for some reason. There food isn't the greatest but I do enjoy the wings. I go with the mango habanero always. Its just the right amount of heat for me. My girl can't.take one bite but she tries.

Let me start off by saying, this place has no sushi bar! Why didn't someone's review say that? To me, sushi is a experience, I love watching and interacting with my chef. The sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.Price was also on the high side. Was very disappointed. Just seemed like mall sushi.

Great little place of the beaten path. I'm fortunate to be working across the street at the Regency for the next few months and rarely do I miss my large Americano each morning. It's more of a stand then a shop. Very friendly staff and great coffee. That is why I'm the Duke

Let me start off by saying almost didn't come here. 3 stars and some bad reviews. On the bright side they do have a full bar, what could go wrong. Ordered the something pig omelet and it was very good. My faithfull side kick and bed partner Tiff, Orderd the eggs benedict and she loved them. Ordered the berry mimosa (dont drink whiskey till after noon. Doctors orders) that was 90% Champagne and was refreshing. Don't believe some of the reviews. Service was great and wasn't rushed out of here. Will be back here again.
