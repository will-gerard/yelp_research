Great shop, they absolutely know their stuff like nobodies business. Not only do they know what they are talking about, they are courteous. The customer service and knowledge shown here is a pleasant surprise in what is typically an unpleasant space (independent repair shops). Randy, is very thorough, and even speaks fluent German! Couldn't recommend enough.

This airport is very clean and organized. security is relatively efficient and quick so long as it's a domestic flight. I love the parking options, ease of getting to and from the airport and the options for food are fantastic. The only thing that would be helpful is misters outside the ground pickup area for people waiting during summer.

Love doodling on the table, had a great visit, server was super sweet also. I've pretty much always had great food and service. The only drawback (if you could call it one) is that you lose your fantastic creative creations when you leave. Unless of course you wana buss the table for them. Haha either way, great fun and food.

Excellent customer service, very knowledgable staff and reputable Penske name backing it all. If you're in the market for a Porsche, this is the best option in Arizona.

Great customer service and beautiful complex. Ask for Brian or Troy, both will take really great care of you and actually take the time to answer your questions. Dennis in finance is extremely professional and goes over options with precision and ease. If you want a great deal, go to the auction. If you want a good car, for a good price with perfect customer service, come here. Kudos.

So I typically don't review a Denny's, but the food is way better lately. More specially Jeremy, the server has an energy and level of customer service typically reserved for restaurants with 4 dollar signs not 1. So the 5 stars, due 90% to the amazing service from Jeremy, and we now frequent and ask to only be seated in his section. And the other 10%? Kudos to the chef in the back for producing some pretty decent meals that 5 years ago I wouldn't have ever concluded came from a quick diner.

Driving around looking for pizza, came across this place. The by the slice options weren't fantastic although to the stores defense it is later on a Sunday night. I must say the people working the register, I'm thinking the owner? Was very very grumpy. I had a question but could hardly imagine having asked it since he looked like he would ask me to leave if I didn't do what I supposed to. Pay and walk away. The pizza, very over priced for by the slice and was - even though heated up again in the oven very soggy, greasy and lifeless in the flavor department. Hey you never know until you try it right? Skipping in the future, not really any reasons to come back other than convenient hours.

I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with this place. I didn't actually move in but I would definitely strongly recommend this place to anyone looking at this 101 loop north/east area. Ciera, the community manager and her entire staff here are absolutely a pleasure to deal with. They are very accommodating, and thorough. As mentioned, even though I didn't actually move-in I couldn't say enough great things. The center courtyard area is beautiful, they just installed lighting on the water features / waterfalls and trees and it's like a hidden little paradise.

This is an interesting option for Asian cuisine. You get lots of different options and the prices are pretty reasonable. I'm a vegetarian so it's interesting to actually have options for me too! Customer service is better than I anticipated since it's technically fast food. I can't provide and fast food place with a perfect 5 stars so it'll get my best fast food score of 4.

Great service, nice trucks, friendly staff!! In typical Penske fashion they are organized, prepared for your arrival and on top of everything they do. Very impressed but not surprised. The one thing I will say is check out the back lot, it's miraculous how they get all the trucks parked in such a small lot!

If you're looking to have a nice breakfast and don't want to deal with cooking at home, but you want to enjoy a home-cooked style meal; this is your place.   I love the homely and friendly atmosphere, it definitely allows for a comfortable and enjoyable first meal of the day.  The staff are always beyond friendly and very courteous. The customer service and food are always on point and I've not ever had anything but a great experience.  I've been coming here at least once a month for 3 years now and I'm sort of shocked I've  never reviewed these guys. I suppose sometimes the best places we visit we just assume don't need to extra love, but they always do!   The pricing is the best part, very reasonable.

Enjoyed a lovely thanksgiving dinner here with my family. The service, top notch. The atmosphere is absolutely the standard for both design and comfort. The food, was right to boot. I ordered the Lobster Pot Pie, which was although a little confusing as a dish; absolutely delicious. The butternut squash soup prior made my taste buds sing. I had never been here before so it was a very smooth and pleasant first visit. After dinner, we took our wine and toured the christmas lights throughout the resort which just topped it all off nicely. The outdoor bar and fire-pits were a nice spot to relax after a nice walk too. Will definately be back for more!

The atmosphere is always great. The selection is always good and there are definitely always alternating options all over the store. I find myself coming here for both lunch and dinner on a pretty regular basis. Both my coworkers and myself like to come here as often as possible because it's the healthiest option around and the most friendly atmosphere we can seem to find nearby. Some may joke that this place is called whole paycheck which it definitely can but I would much rather spend a couple extra bucks to eat here then go to fast food and feel gross after.

Great atmosphere, super friendly staff. Beautiful outdoor patio. Quiet but still lively environment. The menu is varied and includes a healthy mix for pretty much anyone in the group or your family.   Selection of local bears which I appreciate for supporting economy of the state. Tonight I'm having the the Thai BBQ which, when inquiring about get an exuberant YES from anyone nearby that works here!   The Thai ribs were absolutely incredible, as recommended. The slaw was 90% there but needed a different green to compliment the apples, cranberries and cashews.  Mac & Cheese came cold, so needed to go back for a refire. I'm easy going to I only asked to heat. They chose to remake it. This means I didn't get a chance to let the spice of the Mac & cheese compliment the sweet of the Thai bbq. Nonetheless was fantastic.   Eric (I presume the manager) took the time to visit and make sure our meal and visit was pleasant. Nice touches make a visit that much more enjoyable. Our server, Brandyn was great, super sweet very attentive.

I absolutely love this place. I do my best to come here at the very least once a week. If you're timing is right and you have a group of 4 or less, you can usually get a great spot. I've had a lot of very good, high quality sushi from all over the country and have no problem coming here anytime to grab dinner and be satisfied.  The vibe, the atmosphere is fantastic. Typically very friendly when you come in the front door. Very typical, and welcome greetings from the entire staff when you enter. The food as mentioned is very good and especially when you start to consider the prices. The cost (determined by color of plates floating by) are very low for the food you are getting.  I couldn't be happier with this place, the staff and the service. Anytime I have visitors here from LA, Texas, I make sure to take them and they are always blown away.. and frankly jealous I get to live merely minutes from here!  If you're coming with a larger group, keep a heads up that you won't see immediate seating since this place is made mostly for smaller parties of 4 or so.

While some of the staff are somewhat friendly, the other half of the staff here are rude, short with you and dismissive. I've been here probably 25-30 times and it's odd that it's such a mixed bag.   I've been here on several occasions where the employees are more concerned with pre-closing and getting chores done so they can leave. I've pretty much never had a drink made correctly here and shots are killed / dead 85% of the time.  I love Starbucks, and if it weren't for this stores great location I wouldn't ever come back. My thoughts go to the few employees at this location that do try hard, my guess is poor management.

This is my - on the way to work - Starbucks and I must say, the staff are always polite, efficient and friendly. My very early mornings at work are always made much more pleasant. I've been to roughly 1 million of the 10 million Starbucks in this nation, and customer service is apparently optional. This store is the exception. Take the extra trip to come here. ( just please do so after 8am so there's no line ) :)

I love apple but if you're new to the brand be prepared for sassy attitudes from the modern day Genius Bar. I used to work for apple and I was always humble at the Genius Bar, this must just be the new trend.

Wow. Feel bad for the waiter who is doing everything here seemingly because someone didn't staff the place properly. We got here literally 1 hour and 15 minutes ago and we just now got food, no it's not packed. There are maybe 4-5 tables. The food is disgusting, cold, rushed. The waiter is so stressed out it looks like he was given both horrible treatment and way too much responsibility. I get that this is IHOP and not a fine dining establishment. I get that this is a different style of casual dining and expectations shouldn't exactly by at 5 stars.  Someone seriously needs to address the lack of staffing in this place and furthermore - simply shut down the place if you can't stay open or don't have the people. CLOSE. Every single plate is disgusting, undercooked and cold. We come here every week and it's not usually great, but this... This was unacceptable. I really don't know how IHOP is willing to put it's name on this building. Something's got to give here. 2 hour visits are unacceptable.

Pleasantly surprised! I know this sounds weird, but great water is hard to find if you aren't a drinker! Great service, surprisingly high quality, fresh food and great prices. It seems like all the reviews are only for the bar, but hey- where can you find fresh food that is actually good until 1am? Comfortable, up-beat atmosphere. Tiffany our server was very nice, attentive, and recommended the shrimp tacos which I loved. -- this place is under-rated! :)

Auburn is great, very attentive and friendly. I love this place, and it's my go-to for a quick, great tasting and incredibly inexpensive option for Mexican food. (Or any food for that matter. It's funny because for less than what it would cost to drive through some crappy fast food joint, stink up your car and clog your arteries you can instead eat here.   I love how the food is always fresh, and the eventually remember your order once you become a regular like myself. Granted I only do water because I'm a tad healthier than most, it's still very reasonable cost wise to get beverages.   One of the best things, aside from speed, taste, Etc is they are usually open when you want them to be. Couldn't be happier as usual. Have I mentioned the water tastes of angel tears?

I've been a car enthusiast for a very long time and I'm extremely particular about who I allow to touch my vehicles. In the case of washing or detailing a car this is very critical. When you get into washing or touching the paint of a car, it's difficult to do a great job.   Pit stop, has singlehandedly altered my point of view on a business of this type. Their absolute uncompromising attention to detail is amazing. I've been to tons of establishments like this, none with this level of organization and quality.  With how fastidious, particular and obsessed with quality these guys are; I wouldn't take my car to anyone but them moving forward. If you haven't had a chance to swing by, meet the amazing people here and see their facility you should absolute do so.     I don't hand out compliments easily, especially when it comes to something as important as the care of my child. (Albeit a vehicle).

This place is amazing, talk about great atmosphere, incredible customer service, great attitudes, and... of course incredible... healthy food. I don't get to come down here much, but when I do, the steak taco's are incredible. Anytime I have a visitor in from out of town, I make a point to come to True Food. The only drawback?.. its popular, its good, so you have to be patient and wait for a table on a busy day. All-in-All, one of my favorite restaurants in the valley!

Local place, great "posted" hours of operation. I love the selections but I really wish they didn't pre-close 30-45 minutes early. I love froyo, but I don't want to assume I can go somewhere because it's open, only to find out---  nah they just say that, the employees want the hell out of there so they make sure they don't have to stay more than 12 seconds past posted closing time. I get it, I don't wana stay later than needed at my job either. My recommendation, change the posted hours and scheduled employee shifts to allow closing after the people will think you've actually shut down for the day- like most businesses. Other than this slightly annoying scheduling mis-hap, love this place, and will continue to come.. If I can do the math on closing times that is! Ha

What's not to love, super easy carwash. Nice staff and very seldom have anything not work perfectly. You drive through a tunnel yourself then you dry if you'd like after, "free sucky vacuums" too! The spot free does a great job and the materials used on their washing curtains is super gentle on paint. Good for car enthusiasts like me that don't have a place to wash their car at home due to pesky HOA rules.

Worst customer experience in my history of knowing what's wrong and right. I've worked for some of the top companies with retail marks, Apple, Porsche, etc. The arrogance, negativity and dismissive behavior is not just deplorable, its unacceptable.  I would understand if this was behavior provided and witness by entry-level employees, however this was the general manager of the store. I would also leave some leeway if this was a franchise location, however this is a Verizon CORPORATE store.   I was and still am disgusted at my treatment by @verizonwireless and will likely terminate my services with them in the future.

very pleasant experience, I'm not one to review hotels unless its a resort. staff was attentive, pleasant and knowledgeable. Kate at the front desk, was the star of my visit. She knew exactly where to point me for food, and keeping my down-time between meetings occupied. I live in scottsdale, but came down here for meetings so I stayed downtown a few days. Great experience, thanks Kate!

After reading several reviews I cautiously visited for an important evening. I called ahead and spoke to the manager to ensure we had a great visit. We had fantastic service, and the food was incredible. I absolutely love the decor and environment. The only potential knock would be I don't know if my good service was due to my calling ahead (it seemed not however). I saw the same attention to detail and good service for all guests that night. Would definitely return.

Oddly enough I've never been here but we have it catered at my work all the time. It's just down the street from me and I'm tempted to go in sometime. The sliders and the Mac & cheese are absolutely out of this world and I have to say for never having actually visited the restaurant I'm compelled to recommend this place to anyone!

Disappointed. Tonight was my 8th, and final visit. I loved the idea, concept and of course the groupon deal is great.  My issue, is the box office staff are the only employees with any sort of hint they care about being there. The servers, even manager, all act like they would rather be doing anything but assisting you. The lack of customer service is eye-opening. Especially in Scottsdale. This was my "third and final" attempt. My last 2 visits were equally as bad just in different ways. All three, food was cold, or undercooked, servers short and rude with you and rarely listen to requests. As for the desert? "We have a contract and can't alter or change anything" really guys? C'mon. Half the seats in the theaters, broken. Touch screens at entrance, broken, bathrooms, dirty. My first few visits to this place were amazing. I found an awesome budget alternative to they VERY good iPic. I fear no longer is this a place I will recommend or visit again. Management might be the key here, and honestly with how slow they are getting I'm not surprised if they shut their doors soon. I wanted this place to be awesome and hopefully someone does something to change it soon because tonight was horrible.

The pizza is awesome and most of the time you come in service is pretty awesome. I had a little snag the last trip where it looked like maybe the server was having an off day (but everyone does so no biggie). Overall really great pizza, prices are a little on the high side once you get drinks and appetizers but you get what you pay for. All the food is top notch.

Gave this place a month of being open before I popped in. Doesn't appear they have anything organized yet. The wait was way too long for being almost empty, I've given them 2 chances now. Second time, was packed which duplicated the response time of staff who hardly acknowledged anyone in my family. Over-priced food was - okay at best, server seemed eager to go on break and didn't check in. Go here for the view, and, skip food, drinks or anyone working there all together. Disappointed.

Another horrible experience, I'm providing 2 stars instead of 1 only due to the fact that I didn't hate the food. Food wasn't -- good, but it wasn't horrible either? Overpriced, rude staff, very stuck up. It appears that this place is staying open by default and location. Steer clear, make the drive further south to North. Better food, better parking, less attitude..

Great view, horribly located next to houses where I can imagine the screaming drunks at the table next to us didn't enjoy. Food was sub-par, wrong compared to what was ordered and the staff didn't seem to care much about anything other Than Facebook or twitter on their smartphones.   This should be a high class place, it's not. I think the only reason it's open is so locals can get hammered somewhere close to home and not get a DUI on the way home since while leaving literally every person exiting the parking lot is predominantly and obviously under the influence considering the belligerent attitudes and curb hopping as they drive away lights off or skimming bushes as they attempt to see where they are going.   I think this place is confused on identity, not much of a direction with the menu, and the trash being taken out next to my car? Cool... Not so much. I expected my third visit maybe they could've finally figured out how to do this. My opinion, go down the street to Grimaldi's or Juan Jaime's which both have great service, great patios and amazing food. If you're here for a game of golf, save yourself the hassle of thinking it's easy to grab a drink or some dinner here and head down the street for real service and food. This is also, the second time we've been here as a family and had the police show up because apparently the restaurant was built too close to homes and neighbors call to complain... Poor planning on the restaurant and cities part, and it's sad for the people that have to live next door, this isn't a quiet place.   I review honestly and like to give every poor performer a few chances before judging completely. This was my last chance and you better believe everyone I know around town is starting to agree. I would like to see this turn into a coffee shop instead. Or just close down so Thompson peak traffic doesn't back up!

Very considerate and attentive staff. Great atmosphere,  well thought out layout, nicely decorated and homie warmth throughout. Intelligently creative interior design.  The patio is lovely and wraps around the restaurant and bar. It does seem to be important to be mindful there are residents who live within earshot of the outdoor section.   Pizza was an A+, food was hot, and servers have a great attitude and check on you periodically. This is a cozy, 'don't-wana-leave' type of place and I am happy to live so close by.   Tonight was a great experience and albeit we forgot to take home our left-overs, we will return!   As an important side note; I can tell the neighbors likely also love the view here, so we did our best to respect their privacy, and ambient noise while outside. I grew up on the beach in California and visitors were always considerate near our home so we have personal experiences with returning the favor!

Friendly staff, great prices. The food is decent especially for how inexpensive it is. Mind your plates though as they do add up if you aren't careful. My only complaint is the staff are occasionally too busy to check on you after you've gotten settled in. Overall a great time, come here very frequently!

If you like good comfort food, and old traditional English comfort this is the place to come for dinner. Pasties are a unique English dinner item that must be tried.   Amazing atmosphere, I absolutely love this old home turned into restaurant. The second you get here from the courtyard patio seating to the inside seating, you feel like you're in an English pub, and comfortable.  The staff, and this is important to me; knows the menu, provide excellent recommendations and know how and when to check in on you throughout your meal.  This is only my 2nd visit, but it most certainly won't be my last! Love this place.

This is a tough one. The staff, is very very friendly. The construction of the property is another story all together. I feel a little bait and switch action going on here. You can definitely tell that this was designed to be a cheap dorm room.. I'm sorry, a profitable business venture. It's clear all the money in the property went into the amenities like the pool area, outdoor lounge areas, club-house, etc.  Where they went on the cheap? The actual apartments. I'm from California where we have codes, and rules for building homes so they are structurally sound and reasonably soundproofed. This does not seem to carry over for this particular property. Oddly enough even though this property is advertised as a "Luxury Apartment Community", the construction was nothing short of a mile from that.   The walls are so paper thin you can hear your neighbors talking, sneezing, coughing, same floor, across the hall, and when it comes to anyone above you: anticipate feeling like the couch and a wrecking ball are going to come straight through the floor at any moment.   The unit I attempted to rent was never lived in before, brand new, and as advertised to be a "Luxury Apartment". This is absolutely ridiculous. The construction was so shoddy, I ended up taking more photos of what was wrong with the apartment then my 20 year old home I was looking to move away from. Walls gouged, countertops chipped, bent shower rods, paint overspray on fixtures, paint on the carpet. The washer and dryer? oh boy. They have ruined nearly 85% of my entire wardrobe to date. Simple solution, ask for another units keys that is vacant to do laundry. Not viable. This merely caused the same issue, as the property company clearly bought the cheapest washer / dryer combo's (likely refurbished units) because they had electrical grease in all 3 units I attempted to do laundry in.  How about common things like, you get a garage you should be able to use it right? no. 18 days and still no garage as promised and as stipulated would be provided in documentation I was given. The garage I was assigned was nowhere near my residence, and had been propped open for nearly 11 months. considering this place is supposed to be brand new and they are pushing the whole its perfect thing you would think they would keep things nice and clean and operational. nah.   Yes, it gets better! My car, which was supposed to be parked neatly in my garage (that i couldn't use) had some very precious belongings stolen from inside. And, my car has sustained damage from debris flying from the construction site next door and from inconsiderate neighbors who decided to hit my car without leaving a note.  I have learned via neighbors on fb, and our community form and in person that now several other incidents of theft and breaking have been pretty frequent. This community is in North Phoenix, so I was assuming safe? guess not. Infact, you don't need any type of keycard / key / pass to get on to any floor of any building on the complex. This is likely the reason for so many recent breaking to both garages and cars.   I've yet to mention the firedoors on each floor of the buildings, and the gates to the common areas slam like vault door being closed at 100lbs of force. Anytime someone comes in or out of the common area below, SLAM. and I'm woken up. 10pm, 3am, whenever anyone wants to wander about.  This has been an absolute nightmare, and unfortunately a few paragraphs can only touch the tip of the iceberg that is my horrid 19 day experience here. (I'm still waiting 2 weeks later to hear back from any of the staff or management).

Slapping me with a bill for $9,000 after moving out since they ignored my requests for help. Disgusting organization. I work for a Fortune 500 company assisting customers daily and making sure you at least acknowledge a concern is step 1.  I have never seen such absolute disorganization and chaos at a rental property. I've lived in dorms, apartments all over the country and this takes apartment living to a new low. They do a great job of dressing things up to make you think its awesome. The few that have commented positively here have managed to do so mysteriously and conveniently within a few days of my posting my accurate depiction of the experiences I have. I have e-mail, video and phone proof of the ridiculous amount of neglect shown at this property.

Came here for a holiday party so I can't tell if this was business as usual. The staff are friendly, food was good. Gameplay is interesting but I'm not a golfer so my input is only on the experience as a whole. Very nice facility, clean too!

I'm not going to get crazy with a full-on analysis of a burger spot. However, I can say in typical fox fashion, this place is spot on. The food was great, atmosphere good - and very friendly staff that actually looked and felt like they genuinely wanted to assist you. As far as burgers goes, check this place out. definitely a nice new spin.

Great little spot, fantastic healthy options that taste great and for very reasonable prices. Great atmosphere and relatively quick considering everything is made to order. You have to really look for this place since it's hiding in between some other shops and food places. This place has yet to serve food or smoothies that aren't fantastic. Great job whoever came up with it! I'll definitely come here as often as I can for lunch, new favorite spot.

I've done a review of this place 3 times and they never show up.. But I want it to stick around because the food is amazing the smoothies are great and the prices are better. My entire work has sort of flooded this place with business lately and I can't tell enough people how awesome it is. Keep your eyes peeled it's sort of tiny tucked between two other stores.

Jade is one of my all-time favorite places for high quality Asian cuisine and incredible atmosphere. My coworkers told me about this place a couple years ago and I've loved it ever-since. Now with the new location, it's been taken to the next level. The owners take extreme pride in making sure your experience is the best. The food; incredibly well thought out and prepared.

I love this place. I'm a perfectionist that enjoys the finer details and these cards are great for that. The staff are always very sweet and helpful.   Sign up for the rewards program if you plan on coming here throughout the year.

First off I have to say, great location and I love that on Friday night at 7pm there is plenty of seating! The atmosphere is fantastic and very authentic. Lights and decor that definitely match the food you're eating.  The staff are very friendly and it would appear perhaps the manager is right in the line making food with the rest of the employees which is a good sign of a well run place.  The kitchen is immaculate, I mean, very clean. Which is hugely impressive for a fast food place.  The prices are very reasonable and they make their tortillas fresh, on the spot! Very cool. I had a chicken burrito enchilada style and it was fantastic!  Great experience, I'll be back for sure!
