Bad service + bad message = canceled membership.    If the lazy girl you set your appointment with says she will match you and your girlfriend up with who you've had before and then you get the therapist that your girlfriend has had multiple times and she gets the new girl that sits in the chair the whole time you look like an idiot.    Then when you bring it to the girls attention at the front desk and get attitude - really?  I get it, I wouldn't be excited about working for $10/hr either but you didn't get drafted for the job you choose it so give it a little effort and check your ego when someone has a complaint.

Awesome food - great happy hour.  Definitely try the pork belly, butterfish and Serrano chile roll.

I don't know why I continue to waste my time with this place - overpriced mediocre food and the most unfriendly staff in Arcadia.  I guess I just want it to be good because of the location, but I'm over it.  Last time I'm there we walk in and ask if we can watch the NBA Playoff game - the bar tender tells us he's rather watch the hockey so sorry.  Pretty intense.

I was referred to MUVIT by a friend a little over a year ago.  Since then, I have referred at least 10 people to them because thier prices are fair, they are very carful with you belongings, they show up when they say they will and are just good guys.  I highly recomend them to anyone needing to move in town or across country.

Love the food but the service is consistently horrible - 10 min wait in the drive thru with nothing but a "I'll be right with you followed by 10 mins of silence."  Not acceptable.  Then the kicker is going inside to order because I really like the food, asking what happened and having the 12yr old at the counter give me attitude and act like a total prick.    I like supporting local restaurants but you need to pick your s*&$ up.  It doesn't matter how good you food is - if I know its going to be a hassle more often than not I'll just go to one of the other 900 burger places in town...
