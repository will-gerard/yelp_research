I have been going to this nail place for over a year now, especially because it is near my work. I only have an hour for lunch so this location was good. HOWEVER, after giving them good consistent business for over a year, I was treated RUDELY because a local celebrity came in (Linda Williams - news anchor for fox 10). Half-way into my appointment, Linda Williams comes in. The manager makes my nail technician leave me and do Linda Williams job. I had to wait 15 minutes until I got attention again. The funny thing is I ACTUALLY made an appointment. Because of the delay, I did not get good treatment. I had to rush because I had to be back at work. I had to rush out of there. The manager didn't even offer to comp my service.   THIS IS BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE TO THE CORE AND I WILL NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN!

It was not good. There were 3 customers and it still took forever to get the food. The ginger tasted metally, the sashimi was cut wrong and felt off, the wasabi had no spice, and the chimichanga roll was a cold fish stick in sushi form. We were reluctant to leave any tip but gave a little something for goodwill.

When you first move into this place, there is hope that the place will deliver what it promises. Especially, when you are paying a premium. But it is all smoke and mirrors. From the beginning there are nothing but problems and attitude.  I kept an open mind because I knew it was a newly developed place, but after you read all that has happened (and it hasn't even been a year) you will see why this place is a hazard zone. You don't want to be stuck here!  The building was first owned by Core Campus Communities Tempe (called the place The Hub) and then quickly sold the place to Inland American Communities (University House). When I met up with the new management, they told me that the old team neglected to tell them a lot before they signed over. This was red flag number one.  One thing the place promised is a working Internet. When I moved in, my Internet did not work. This took 3 months to fix. When I told them of the problem, they were frustrated because the old management wasn't supposed to put routers in the unit and now new management has to deal with it because it was done. SERIOUSLY? Instead of helping me, you state how you shouldn't be responsible. No one took this serious. I tried to take it in my hands and work with COX but I don't have access to the account and UH does not want to give you any access. CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING WITHOUT INTERNET? Also, they don't offer concession when they put you in a bind. I had to repeatedly battle in getting a concession.  Another problem, the appliances. The stove makes popping noises. The microwave caught on fire. Every use , it would overheat and the plastic would burn and emit hazardous and smelly odor. When reported, It took a month to replace. CAN YOU IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO USE A MICROWAVE? Again, had to adamantly ask for a concession for the inconvenience.   Another, the hot water and the ac. There was no hot water and the ac didn't work. It took about a month to fix. NO HOT WATER OR AC!  Also security is nice and all, but it feels like a prison living here. They bring in dogs, check to see if you are a resident so you can be let in the building, and one time forced you to sign in and out of the building.   Finally, the BIG ONE, the buildings HVAC water line broke and flooded the building from the 8th floor down. CAN YOU IMAGINE having your property in jeopardy like that? This made the elevators inoperable. There are 19 floors and using the stairs is a drag. Due to this, the power and water was shut off. NO POWER OR WATER! They forced you into a nearby hotel where you couldn't have access to your room. An insurance adjuster came into your unit when you weren't there and threw away everything you had in the fridge. Instead repaying you instantly or offering concession to make up for the MAJOR INCONVENIENCE, they are forcing you to work with the insurance process. As of yet. no contact information has been provided for the insurance company.   This makes me think, what other structural integrity issues this place has? I do not feel safe living in this place. It seems like shoddy work was done and the management are just scammers trying to extract as much money as possible.   In addition to the above, there are numerous other issues, The furniture is hard and uncomfortable. The hallways smell of trash because they don't enforce proper trash disposal. The elevators work some of the time and if it does then there is a good chance that beer cans and trash are all over it.  You will never be able to work with COX because you don't have access and aren't willing to help. So if you have cable or Internet problems, you are SOL.   Also, the little windows that you have will now have restrictors.   Management is horrible. This building is horrible.   I already know of 15 people who have contacted attorneys to represent them against this place. There are probably more.   THIS IS A WARNING. Don't regret living in this place when it is too late and serious bodily injury occurs.
