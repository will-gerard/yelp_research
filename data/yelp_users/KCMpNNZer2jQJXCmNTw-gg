Worst service ever!  Nobody can give you a straight answer on anything!  Hello people!  The GM needs to come in here and get this place streamlined!  Hate to even give them 1 star:-( Dean, Dan, & Diego, I hope you all loose your jobs!

Food was amazing! Had the shrimp & chips and my daughter had the kids fish & chips.  This place has great staff, it's very clean (even smells like Hawaii!), and the food was great!  Will be coming here again!!  Welcome to Scottsdale Coconut's!

Love the people, super clean, and they take care of Coco and Jenny as if they were their own dogs!  Lori's so kind and caring, she really listens to how I want their cuts done.  I really love the fact that on the car ride home I don't have loose dog hair flying around, or hyper stressed out pups.  Keep up the great work!   Oh!  Best price in town for a full groom or just a bath and brush!
