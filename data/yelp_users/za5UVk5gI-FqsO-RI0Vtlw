I approach most joints like Jolta Java as if it's going to be a four or five star experience, otherwise, why would I be going.  So, the moment I walked in to Jolta Java, it had the feel of a 4 or 5 star place.  My wife and I order our coffees, mine was hot, hers was iced.  The girl making the drinks didn't really seem to know what she was doing.  She had to ask another employee a couple of questions before making them.  My wife's iced coffee didn't have enough sweetener in it so we had to ask for another squeeze.  THEN, as I'm waiting for my latte, I look across the store and see two employees smooching and hugging behind the counter, as if this coffee shop was their own private little romantic cabana.  So, now it's a three star joint.  I can get over it, but not too excited about it.  THEN, the dude, Mr. Schmoocher, is totally obnoxious and loud with the other employees, including Mrs. Schmoocher, calling each customer who comes in "Boss".    If the owner reads these reviews (hopefully Mr. Schmoocher isn't the owner), you need to do something about this guy if you want your shop to thrive.  Huge problems!  And that's how it moved from a 4 or 5 star joint to a 1 star joint.

Alright, I was up in the Phoenix area from Tucson for an overnight trip and I had some time to head to Scottsdale for a bite to eat.  Used yelp to find this joint and, wow, what a fantastic meal.  I went for the "fish candy" which was spectacular, but go for the half plate.  Plus, they have Anchor Steam in bottles!  I can never pass that up.

This place was cool but, wow, it was empty on a Friday night!  Not sure what's up with that.  Our group of four enjoyed our time, my wife and I were visiting with friends that we hadn't seen in 10 years so the lack of a crowd was actually a benefit, quieter and no wait.  I went simple and had a Negra Modelo and my dinner order was "Stuffed Peppers" which was excellent.  I would definitely go again as we really enjoyed the food and received excellent service.

I have to preface my review by saying that I haven't actually climbed at Focus, but my son attended a competition here.  I can say that the front desk was organized and seemed to have their stuff together.  The gym itself has a combination of bouldering and roped climbing though most of the gym appeared to be dedicated to bouldering.  All around good experience for us on an early Saturday morning.
