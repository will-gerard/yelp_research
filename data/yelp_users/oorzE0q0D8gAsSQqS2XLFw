The purpose of this review: I'm writing this review to make sure another customer will not have the experience I've had.   I'm disappointed in this gym. I was a member for years. My membership was up and it was time for me to move on. Knowing how frustrating it can be to move on from a gym I called in to confirm my contract expiration date 2 months before it was up. Once I confirmed it w/ the front desk I contacted the # I was given to ensure my request would be processed. I followed up w/ the front desk in December and was told my contract would be up on the 21st.  Guess what happened next. Yep, I was charged again. So I called in thinking "no big deal, they know me. I mean I've been a member for years and held up my end of the contract." I called at 8 this morning and was told the person I needed to speak w/ giving a tour and would call me back in 5 minutes. "Okay no big deal" so I wait 2 HOURS an decided to follow up - "O I'm sorry SHE HAD TO GO OUTSIDE TO TALK w/ HER FATHER" - You've got to be kidding me, well I guess stuff happens - the representative followed up by saying she would make it her top priority to have her call me. I waited for 4 HOURS and did not receive a call back!! So I followed up again and spoke w/ Brian - "I don't see any notes on your file so I can give you the information again and you can call or send an email" Hahaha you have to be kidding me? The staff can't remember to call me back and I'm responsible for a note not being added to a file?   If you're considering this gym it might be a good idea to explore ALL of your options before signing up. There is more to a gym than the price.   A Note To Golds Gym Management: Make your customers your top priority - People over Profit!   Michael

Woohoo! As good as it gets!! I've been in the market searching for a new Barber for about 3 months. I was impressed with my experience. The Best Barber Shop I've been to!

Every great experience starts with the staff. I don't feel guilty eating the food because it's all healthy and no wait like other popular breakfast joints.
