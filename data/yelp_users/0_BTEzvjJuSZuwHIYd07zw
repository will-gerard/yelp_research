This is the slowest Starbucks I've ever been too. I go through the drive through once in a while to see if they improve but they never do. Weather you're drive through or going inside. I noticed they so joke around a lot instead of making the drinks. Probably won't be going here no more.

This is the slowest einstens bagel ever. I've been here roughly about 6 times and every time it takes 10 minutes plus just for a toasted bagel. I feel the employees there talk to each other more than making customers food. Really don't recommend this location.

I just brought my car in for a wash herr at cobblestone. The moment I pulled in I was not impressed with how the guy greeted me and right away tried selling me a $50 car wash. I asked can he vacuum the inside cause I have dog hair on the seats and his answer was we will try our best. 5 minutes later my car was already being washed. What the heck? Did they even bother to vacuum ? Overall ... bad experience . I've been here before where it was alot better but today is making me think twice about coming again.

Hands down best gyro spot in Arizona. I live in east Mesa and I drive here when I'm wanting a gyro! Friendly staff as well!

Food is great here don't get me wrong . I don't want to come off as racy ... but I'm Asian myself and felt like while I was eating everyone around me was being helped over me. The Asian gal there seemed like she would not help me nor come to my table asking how everything was tasting like everyone else.   Love the food but was pretty disappointed in the customer service area ....

Best thai food hands down in Arizona. I always get the yellow curry extra spicy and it's the best curry that I've tasted! Excellent customer service. This is a hole in the wall restarunt!

I came to the shop to ask some questions. I've never owned a vape before and has questions about how it works. The employees they were really friendly and helpful. I had all my questions answered and was comfortable what what I needed to purchase to start. Overall great customer service took the time to help me out even though I didn't know anything about it. Definitely will be coming back to doing business with them and also just to hang out it seems like a real cool hangout spot!
