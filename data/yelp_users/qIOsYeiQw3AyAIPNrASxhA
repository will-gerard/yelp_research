Gotta give this salon 5 stars. Marius and his adorable mom own this salon and they are the friendliest and most easy going salon to get your hair done/ cut at. Prices are reasonable the place is very clean and every time I go somewhere else it never compares to the style and color I get here. I will always come back and I recommend anyone who needs a hair fix to come here.

I used to be so obsessed with coming here on a weekly basis for their coffee, pastries, breakfast sandwiches burritos or omelets. Or even to get dinner here but now we live further away and I don't make it out as often as I would like. Plus it's kinda pricey but worth every penny. Their house coffee is one of the best coffees and their pastries are to die for. I always get their mousse cake or chocolate truffles. For breakfast we like to come to the omelet bar on the weekends the chef cooks it right in front of you exactly how you want. You can even request egg whites! The burritos and breakfasts sandwiches are another one of our favorites when the omelette bar isn't running.   If you're in the mood to cook a nice dinner we come to the meat department here and pick up a couple rib-eyes (no better rib eye to grill in town then from here) or their Chilean sea bass... Sooooo yummy!! Be ready to spend a little but it's worth it. I wouldn't do my weekly grocery shopping here but it's always nice to come get a little treat and the atmosphere is really nice too.  I forgot to mention their sushi bar is very good!!!

Seriously this mall sucks. Every time I go I expect a surprise but same old arrowhead. No selection and I never find anything I like except auntie Anne's pretzels which I enjoyed very much but as far as clothes go.... No thank you.

I have to give this 4 stars because I have so many great memories here. My first date with my boyfriend was here and I remember getting a prime rib ahi tuna coconut shrimp and a French dip and we devoured it. We love the bread and butter too that you get before your meal! Staff is usually nice for the exception of one time but maybe he was having a bad day... I don't know. But I really do enjoy the food here and it's a nice little cozy restaurant with a great selection of drinks.

Had Rubios catered to my office today. Let's just say catering is not nearly as good as when you go in to Rubios. I usually eat the blackened Mahi Mahi burrito which is delicious but today they brought steak chicken beans rice chips and churros and brownies... My favorite part ... THE CHURROS... The food was kinda bland but it filled me up so that's why I gave it a two. The churros, brownies, chips and salsa made up for the rest. I definitely recommend going in more than catering!

Med reps brought Abuelos for lunch today and it was just as good as going in and dining. I've always loved this restaurant it's actually my moms favorite so we used to go here a lot. Their chips and guac is to die for! Today we had grilled chicken fajitas with beans and rice and that was tasty too. My boyfriend came and met me for lunch so I was able to share with him and he loved it too. Being he is Mexican he is pretty picky about chain Mexican restaurants but he really enjoyed it. Definitely a great lunch and will be coming more in the future for sure!

I love love love this place! My boyfriend introduced me to "Tortas"a traditional Mexican sandwich... And this is the place he said was the closest that reminded him of Mexico. We usually order the pork Tortas and Savritas. The bread is so buttery and the meat is so good! Everything they put inside the sandwich just goes together so well. And their fries they serve on the side are so crispy and buttery as well. Another thing on the menu we enjoy are the flautas. I am always craving this place and pretty much anything you get here is delicious!! Too bad we live so far away because this is by far one of the best quick Mexican restaurants I've been introduced to.

Love this little hole in wall dive bar feel... There's live music and some nights karaoke. Very casual and hospitable place... Not your average Scottsdale bar. Very authentic and has been around for years... The food is good too, the pastrami Reuben is a hit and the nachos. I had the burger once and it was juicy and very flavorful! Great memories here and I definitely recommend :)

Ohhhh my goodness all you foodies out there if you haven't been here you are missing out! I have been coming to Razz's for years! Chef Razz is one of the best chefs I've had the opportunity to try. Do yourself a favor and sit at the chefs table and be ready to be blown away with the taste and creativity in all the dishes! I've eaten over 100 times here and I have never left not satisfied. It's a whole new experience and new flavors each time you go. Highly recommend Razz's on so many levels... The ambience the food the staff just all around 5 star!

Probably my favorite hole in a wall Mexican restaurant. From The chips and salsa & their beans and rice to their carne asada & pastor tacos. My boyfriend also loves their beef tongue tacos but I've never tried them. I think the main thing gnat stands out is the Pastor taco the flavor is sooooo good and tasty!! We go here pretty and always crave it.

Came here with my boyfriend and his family first time and sexism with one of my good girlfriends. Love the scene the food the prices it's all good ... Cappuccino is great with a chocolate croissant is my favorite when I come early or I get the Mac and cheese which is to die for. So creamy and delicious!! I've had a great experience both time and would definitely return... For the food the coffee and the ambience.

Came here for my bday the first time when I was 22... 10 years ago (I'm old) and since then I was hooked. Still one of my favorite sushi/teppanyaki spots in north Scottsdale. The ambience is great, gorgeous restaurant & very big. If there's a wait there's usually room at the bar which is really nice too. Great martinis... Always get the grey goose extra dirty, they make it perfect. All of their sushi is so fresh. I love their friends with benefits roll and squid salad! Teppanyaki filet is one of my favorites too. Definitely recommend coming here for date night or happy hour with friends.

Hospice of the Valley catered to our work today! Super healthy and pretty yummy... Grilled chicken and steak, salads and roasted vegetables ... And strawberry shortcake for dessert:) everything wasn't seasoned very much but that's ok were used to getting foods with too much salt here anyways. My favorite overall was their roasted sweet potatoes! I don't know what they do but they are addicting!

Came here a lot when I lived across the street... It was close to where I lived so came here more for the convenience rather than the sushi. Sushi is ok, casual place to satisfy your sushi cravings at a lower price. Spicy tuna and the surf roll or calamari appetizer is what I usually ordered and it was pretty good. But the last time I came with my boyfriend the tuna was warm and didn't taste as fresh. Turned me away from wanting to come back ... Service was good ... But not a restaurant I would write home about.

I think this place is so overrated. The last 2 times we went there soda machine was not working so that's a bummer especially when you're a soda addict like me. But the biggest thing that turned me off from here is how salty the food is! I think the mussels are my favorite thing there but other than that i think they need to ease up on the salt ... Just an overpriced average restaurant if you ask me.

Came here with a few girlfriends of mine who live in the area. This place is always crowded! We even got there before the busy rush at dinner but it was still packed. The tables and ambience is beautiful... rustic modern contemporary style, If that makes sense. I love the lighting and seating. When we sat down server was very quick to greet us and continued to be very attentive throughout the night. We decided to order a bunch of things we can all pick at to enjoy with our wine and cocktails. We ordered the Prosciutto bruschetta & side salads to start. Than for the main course we split the Pig pizza, chefs board, braised meatballs, calamari, & their truffle garlic bread. We devoured everything!! So much flavor and cooked so well, everything was pretty exquisite. I really enjoyed the whole experience and we will all be returning!

Today the Med reps brought Pita jungle for lunch and it was pretty delicious as always. They brought cilantro lime hummus with pita to start. The golden raisin Greek salad on the side (that I love) & for the main entree they brought beans, rice, chicken, BBQ chicken pizza , and tomato basil pizza. I had two plates! I always love Pita jungle it rarely disappoints! One of my favorites I get when I go in is the Crusted Mahi Mahi ... And I have been craving it. I Definitely plan on going in soon!

We love coming here! This location is my favorite. Tonight we ordered the chicken parmesean and seafood Alfredo... Pretty basic but perfect comfort food. Of course we chowed down on breadsticks & salad. It's a childhood restaurant that I will always have a good memory of and never get sick of. I always have a good experience no matter what we order. Love the free wine tasting too :)

I've been coming to Hot Bagels for over 10 years now. There's a few locations but my favorite one is off of Carefree highway. Honestly no matter what you order is always good. My favorite is the Lox bagel on wheat. I tried it on the everything bagel the other day and it was too salty. So make sure you choose a more plain bagel with it since the capers give enough salt. The salmon is so fresh & I love the tomatoes and onion on it. My boyfriend loves the buffalo chicken hot sandwich or the Reuben. Very friendly fast service and worth coming here for a quick bite.

My favorite nail salon on the west side. The product they use just helps your nails last for a lot longer than most and they do a great job! It's always busy so I make appointment but that's a good thing because you know they are good if everyone keeps coming back! Pretty much any technician I've went to there is excellent!!

Great nail salon! Product isn't cheap like most places and always busy for a reason. Any tech really does a good job there and their nails last for three weeks gels or acrylics. Absolutely love their pedi chairs and best of all its Super clean!!

I get my car detailed once a year one because I have dogs and their hair gets everywhere and it just feels brand new after a good detail... Well sometimes. I've been to many places but this is the best car wash to go to to get your car detailed they literally got every hair every DETAIL of my car shampooed the seats and just made everything look so shiny! My car was a mess and I was beyond shocked when I picked up my car and saw the results. Not only were they so nice and professional they were done quicker than most places I've been to as well. And the genius that I am...I left w my keys but  they didn't even bother to call me and inconvenience me they just pushed the car and finished the job and had it ready at the exact time they initially told me. I am very impressed and I will be coming back for sure and I highly recommend everyone to come here! The detail manager, the detail guy himself, and all of the associated were so nice and did an awesome job. Not pushy at all either like most car washes.

This place is great for breakfast & coffee! My boyfriend and I came here for the first time 4 years ago and love it ever since. We enjoy their capuccino and tasty pastries. The coffee tastes so fresh, they take their time with each one. The staff is very friendly and the place is very cute but a little small. Worth the wait though if there's a line. Absolutely one of our favorite coffee shops in town.

Sadly I have been here a couple times nothing serious but enough to where I needed an IV started and monitored for a few hours and I will say they are the BEST ER I've been to in AZ and their staff really knows what they are doing. U fortunately a lot of medical office urgent cares and ERs now seem less about patient care and more about moving numbers and acting bitter. This ER does not make you feel that way and they are so fast... I've never had to wait longer than 10 min to get in either. Huge bonus

I love el pollo loco! I eat it so much yet I still don't get sick of it. It's quick and easy and the service at this location is so friendly. I love their loco salad... Chicken avocado burrito and the shrimp tacos... I always order a few churros as well.... Best churros I've had since Disneyland :)

My girlfriend and I came to eat here recently & even though it is on the higher end of prices it was definitely worth it! but you do get what you pay for. The rib eye was THE juiciest steak I've had in a long time and all of the side dishes potatoes spinach came out perfect. I highly recommend this place!!

Had breakfast here last weekend with my boyfriend. We've been here a few times and love it. Talk about homemade food... Even the jam for my toast was made from scratch. Portions are huge and tasty. My boyfriend for an omelette with the seasoned potatoes ( which are ridiculously good) and I got French toast of course to satisfy my sweet tooth and ham on the side. Even the ham tastes organic and has good flavor. It's a small little shop and pretty busy because the food is so good. The owners are very friendly and you see them around helping out a lot. Very good breakfast spot and close to the hills to go for a nice hike before or after.

Nom nom nom!! Med reps always bring us these bundt cakes because my office is down the street from here and they are gone in two minutes being here. My favorite is the raspberry with cream cheese or the chocolate mini bundt cakes! So good!

Came here for a third time while having guests in town since they haven't tried it before. I figured I would give it one more try since the first two times I felt like I was drinking sugar water and not impressed, but so many rave about it..... First time I ordered an iced kicker and the second time a caramelizer.... This time I went with a chocolate mocha freeze and again just sugary and low quality taste. The girl was friendly at the window but of course lines were long as usual. I don't plan on coming back unless my blood sugar is severely low and I need a kick :/

If you haven't been here you need to make it a point to come in. The restaurant is a little small but my boyfriend and I came here early to celebrate my birthday and we didn't have much of a wait. The place itself is beautiful and the staff was very friendly greeting us as we came in and very accommodating. For dinner we started off with oysters & the warm jar of king crab and butter. Let me tell you it was so good we were sad when it was all gone! For the main entree I ordered the crab legs and my boyfriend ordered the sea bass (that was the fresh fish that evening) the taste of the seafood is like being in Seattle or right by the ocean. Delicious!! For dessert the server recommended the banofee tart. Ohhhh my goodness it was Devine!! Every course of the meal was a 5 out of 5 the flavors were on point, not too salty not fishy and just buttery deliciousness! I highly recommend this place and I will definitely be going back soon.

Ohhh Oreganos how I love you so much. I have been coming to this place since I was 18 years old. The location in Tempe near campus was my go to place because not only is the food good the service was great and they make the best Bellinis in town! Peach Bellini is my favorite! Sometimes I don't even grab lunch or dinner I will just go in for a pazookie desert which is also delicious. Today we had lunch catered to my office from their Peoria location. They brought a couple pizzas one supreme, one cheese, pasta and two salads. (Sundried tomato salad and a spinach salad with your choice of chicken or beef if you want.) It was all fantastic! Oreganos never disappoints and I am always satisfied with their food. My whole office devoured it all... The only bad thing was they didn't bring pazookie but that just means I need to go in and get one :)

Well I finally tried it! Thanks to my boyfriends sister who was hyping this place up ... We decided to give it a try. All I have to say is thank you Maria!!! This was honestly the closest thing to my favorite ice cream Blue bell. I ordered the Toffee Banofi and ohhh my goodness the ice cream was so creamy, not too sweet, and toffee chunks with nuts and Carmel. Sooo delicious even the whip cream was perfect!! Yummmmm ... The cone was good too not too sweet and thick and I devoured the whole thing. Next time I want to try the Smores or the Horchata ice cream. The girls working there were super sweet and it reminded me of a little ice cream shop from the 50s ...this place is 30 min from where I live but I will definitely be coming back and I highly recommend the toffee Banofi if you go in.

Had Zupas for lunch from the Med reps today. The sandwiches were ok, more bread than the actual filling inside. I had the almond chicken salad sandwich with chips and a cookie. The cookie was delicious!!! White chocolate macadamia nut half chocolate dipped. I was starving so I ate everything but not a place I will crave (besides the cookie) but maybe I need to go in rather than have it catered to see what other options they have.

This place was delicious! A Med rep brought this into my office today for lunch and I couldn't stop eating. The sandwiches were so good with fresh bread tasty meats and the yummy kettle chips (they taste homemade) with aioli sauce. I also had two jumbo chocolate chip cookies  I will definitely be going in next time I'm on central or need to cater.
