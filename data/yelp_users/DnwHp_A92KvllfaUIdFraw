Great new find for us, we stumbled across it on a Sunday and were trying to find a place and not many were open in the area.  We saw it and all the cars 1130am Sunday and thought, why not?   Glad we did, very tasty food, good portions and really good flavor.  Some certainly authenic dishes along with the normal dishes as well!  The Mole was Que Bueno!  The "right crowd" was in the restaurant and knew the food had to be good and we weren't wrong.  Sure it's not in the best part of town, but don't let that scare you off of a great place!

ACT is a fun place to go, maybe not the most fun place to go, but certainly a worthy effort and enjoyable.  The names of the food items play tribute to the local sports scene and such which is cool.  Yeah the make up on the staff is different, but so is AC!  I'll go back when downtown or maybe take an out of towner.

Great real Mexican "street" food and such items.  Great quantity along with quality menu selections.  The decor makes you feel like you would be south of the border too!  Love  this place!  They are sit down and to go, i think they cater too.  They have a panderia along with fresh tortillas to go!

Fun, Festive, Inexpensive, Selection, Culture, Taste, Energetic....  The Ranch is a great place, but be prepared for crowds, I don't know of a time we have been there that it hasn't been busy, but Christmas time ... Ay Carumba!  The produce, the meats, the Cocina, the Bakery, the selection is all amazing... even if you don't live close, bring a cooler with some ice in your car to get what you want/need and then feel better about taking it home!    Be sure to try their resturant (on West end of the building) Tradiciones!

Great small and authentic place!  Yeah, as others have said, maybe not the "best" neighborhood, but we had no issues.  The place is small, so plan to wait if you come in the busy time.  QUALITY food for sure and mainly seafood based but thankfully for me they have non-seafood items for folks like me who don't care for seafood. Everyone at the table loved what we got and would certainly come back again!

I prefer ABC15 for my local news and weather (just can't stand Lin Sue on 12 and some of the other stations...) and really am a fan.   *Did you see me on their "Hey Chris, why did you make the switch to ABC15?" commercials.*  :)  Bill Bellis certainly knows his weather and teaches vs. just spewing out the facts.  Yeah some of the reporters are a bit goofy, but that also makes them human!

Good place, good food, but as the others have said the seating area could use some more attention and los banos need a heavy dose of TLC.    Avoid the 12 lunch rush if you are in a hurry otherwise certainly a place we will be back too when in the area..    I don't think they are open for dinner (but I not 100% sure on that) so the "concern" about getting there before dark should be a non-issue!

WOW!! Glad we finally made it to Los Taquitos! We came for our 1st (and certinaly not last) visit to LT and gotta tell ya - there is a good reason there is a buzz around it!  The Carne Asada was very tasty in my street tacos, the carnita and pastor meat were very tasty and tender.  Their "hot" sauce in the bottles on the table is a good blend of taste/sweet with a little heat.  Can't wait to go back and try more from the menu!

LARGE beer selection and cool beer program for frequent visitors, paired with good selection of pizza, and other pizza joint offerings.  I LOVE their deep dish pizza and love how they do have some crispy toppings from the oven as well.  Many TV's in the bar and quite a few out in the dining room as well.

We often stop here on our way north, so our review is based on breakfast.  Wonderful breakfast, large servings and great flavor are the reasons we keep stopping here. The staff is normally very friendly and keep the coffee coming.  Word to the wise... they serve PLATE SIZE pancakes (not all of them are, but just FYI) so keep that in mind!  Oh, they are "famous" for their pies... but I haven't had the pleasure to sample them in the AM so far.

I will agree this is not the best dealership around, i moved from out of state and needed assistance with the end of the lease and purchasing it.  They wanted to financially screw me over that i called my selling dealer back where we moved from (Bowed Scarff Ford, Kent, WA) and they helped me and partnered with Sunset Ford up on Bell to take care of me, not screw me over and made the process so much better.  These guys at Pioneer would have screwed over a non-savy car person, given the chance!

The free popcorn is a nice perk, but agree with the useful feedback from Jennifer that it is just an older / showing it's age theater that is better for a spur of the moment movie vs. say premiere of Batman or the like.    I think it's days are #'d thou, once the Harkin's comes into the Estrella Falls mall (once that happens).

I am the husband that Linda refers to in her review, I CANNOT express how  PLEASED we are in Goodyear Animal Hospital and attending to our needs in a potentially tough time.   Dr. Megan Johnson.... YOU ROCK!!  We came to your Goodyear Animal Hospital thanks to poor judgment of our former vets (Estrella Animal Hospital) and you took the time, showed you cared (as did your staff) and really helped us thru the visit.  Our dog is actually doing better each day (thou we know it is still day by day with him)   We have certainly spread the word as to how great you and the staff of Goodyear Animal Hospital have been and how disappointed we are in the lack of attention and compassion at a time of real need by of our former vets (Estrella Animal Hospital).   We used to bring those 6 clients to them... yes 6, but now it will be ZERO based on this unfortunate decision made by them on a Friday afternoon.    I ask this... Would any other "hospital" turn away a potential dying patient?  Goodyear Animal Hospital didn't and for that we are most thankful!

We enjoy La Loma Mexican Grille and their unique Tijuana carnitas in addition to their other solid items on their menu.  As to the service in La Loma Mexican Grille - yeah they may not be the most out going, but then again they aren't all over you as well.  Come in, go to the counter, order, find a seat and wait for your order to be called or brought to you.  Make sure you get both bottles for their salsa and taco sauce (which i prefer).

Consistanly great steaks and flavor for sure.  Today was our maybe 10th visit to Texas RH and we keep coming back.  Today's waitress Stacie was an absolute DITZ and let's just say it's a good thing I was in a good mood.  My Ribeye was as tender and tasty as I expect, wife tried the Ribs for the 1st time and they were tender for sure.  Bring your appetite and some time (if you come Fri/Sat after 530) as I am sure you will enjoy as well!

We have been to Frank & Lupe's many times, but last night was the worst service we have had (but was also the 1st time we sat on their patio area).  The food was still wonderful, full of taste and the kick of heat. Good stacked enchilada's & sopapilla's.  We certainly will go back again, but wonder if it was a one off or was the patio for the service gap that is not normal for F & L's.

YUM!  Wife & I went the other day and it was probably 130pm on a Sat afternoon and it was certainly busy but you could get a table.  The menu is quite large and plenty of selections.  The food was good, the homemade sausage was really good, their sauce (gravy) is very tasty and a little the sweet side.    Count us in as fans for sure and nice to have a good Italian deli/eatery to enjoy a meal.

We have only visited once and it was good, but not knock your socks off good.  We will certainly go back and give them another shot. The food was good, we got lucky did not have to really wait for a table.  -Not sure I'd call it the "best" but certainly good-

Had the chance to Tonto Bar & Grill thanks to some friends in Cave Creek who have been here before and suggested it!  We just enjoyed the patio, happy hour and the fire place.  I didn't eat, but a desert was shared by the girls and they loved it!  The atmosphere is classic desert!

Que Bueno!  We got the opportunity to enjoy El Encanto recently (for brunch) and we really did enjoy it!  We had different selections along with some traditional brunch selections/offerings.  The Chorizo and eggs was very tasty, the fresh fruit, the made to order omlettes all were very good. We love the courtyard patio, such a nice touch and makes you feel like you are probably down in Mexico. Can't wait to come back for lunch or dinner sometime soon!

We go to Tradiciones on a somewhat regular basis and love to take the out of towner's there to enjoy the atmosphere and the good food.  The only real thing I am not as thrilled with Tradiciones is that if you want to have a conversation it can be tough at times with the regular mariachi's playing (don't get me wrong they are good and entertaining).  The patio is really nice once it cools down a little outside!  Their Mole' is a sweet / spicy which is a little different and good!

Back to Joe's.... been several years as we are Westside dewelers and on Mother's Day we had Mom & Dad with us and suggested Joe's after the hot experience out at Schenpf''s farm.  Glad we went, Joe's really is quite tasty, is it the best? - Probably not but that is all relative!  For the SE Valley, it's our go to spot for BBQ.  We had the ribs, pulled pork, the Jumbo tater with Pork, coleslaw, mac & Chz, lemon cake, sweet patato pie.  All were really quite tasty.  The "HOT" sauce isn't THAT hot... but good lil kick.  One time we will be there when it's not as hot out and get to try that nice large outdoor seating!  - I gotta say the Lemon Cake kicks ass!

If you want to sit on the patio at a meat-market, have we found the place.  if you are looking for good food with your beverage, it may not really be the place to go...  not horrible but nothing to go out of your way for.   It does have the "beach vibe" somewhat, but really there are much better places for this 40 yearold to go.

Recently had the "pleasure" of being a guest for several days with an ill family member in the ER to ICU to a general room.  Hospital is VERY clean, modern, effecient and such.   Their food (from what I was told) was very good to the patient and our meal in the Cafe was very tasty as well.  They offer a discount to the partner in care in the Cafe as well which is a nice touch!

Tuesday is $1 Tuesdays, Wednesday $2 off combos and such specials thru the week.  There are plenty of regulars which also tells you that it is a place that is well liked.  They have a nice patio and good staff overall.  It may not be the best decor (not bad just a lot of red) within the restaurant but really you are there for the food!

Very pleased with Horizon and the level of service (and clean carpets) that I received.  The tech was very knowledgeable in the cleaning process and taking care to get it done as best he could, while being courteous.  This is a rental property that we just acquired and not knowing the history, the carpets really came out well. - One tip I would suggest is just being a little more careful with the hose thru the house as we had just repainted the property and a couple corners need a touch-up, nothing horrible but I noticed it.  We will use Horizon again and for our home this time (thanks to the dogs this will speed up this need!).

We had them install a pergola for our home and it looks great!  The work is top notch, clean jobsite and no "funny business" on their pricing or when they would do the work.  I absolutely would recommend Booth Built Patio Products without hesitation!

Being able to make an appointment for an urgent care online is a nice touch and really helps to less waiting around other potentially sick folks.  The staff was friendly, but I did have to wait a while in the little exam room... but it was a Sunday and they were busy so I will let that slide (this time).  I appreciate the service, being open 7 days and seeming to know what to do and how to help.

Ground Control, love the name and then you learn the tie-in with the Coffee and the Air Force ... it all makes sense.  As to the place... very good coffee (love the Mayan Mocha) and the Gelato (Blood Orange for me thanks!) and even the food is certainly worth the repeat visit.  We have not really had any service issues, this is more of a "sit & stay" coffee house vs. grab & run from what I have seen so it does take a little longer.  We don't get wine so nothing to report there!  Certainly worth the trip to try and come back again!

The biscuits and the apple-butter was really good too.  The sweet tea was how it should be, sweet without being OVERLY sweet!  Wife had the Beef ribs and baby-backs and was also very pleased. Father-inlaw seemed to enjoy the pulled pork and roasted chicked too!  It's a bit pricey but lots of food for the $$.

Went back last evening and took some friends for their 1st visit and was again pretty tasty.  We did get some large appitizer platter that I would not get again.  You get large enough portions you really don't need it and it was just OK.  The BBQ / Smoked Tri-tip was again really tasty and the ribs (dry thank you) were again really good.  My friend could not stop talking about the Chicken sandwich he got.

We loved this event and sorry that it took us this long to visit after moving to the valley in 2006.  This year our original tickets was on a rainy & chilly Saturday night and thankfully the staff was helpful in allowing us to change to the next Saturday as the event wasn't officially rained out *yet* but this really would have killed it for us.  The next Saturday was dry and cool ... almost perfect!  We have been to DBG in the day many times and loved seeing the gardens in a whole different ... light.   The luminarias are really a special thing and the THOUSANDS of them are really something!  - This really is an adult event as I didn't see a bunch of kids (thankfully) as this probably won't hold their attention.  The ability to get some adult beverages and the music with the lighting really makes for a nice evening with the someone special.  Also we found a cool local band we liked (The Sugar Thieves)!

What can you say about simple, basic, fresh and really tasty burger joint that hasn't been said before?  Honestly I love how simple and tasty it really is.  Reminds me of Dick's back in Seattle (but their fries are even better!) but I love the toasted bun of the burger as well!  While I don't use the "secret menu" it's there and many go Animal style!

YUM.. it's "almost" a Jamba.. OK so some may think I am nutz or others may just understand.  Jamba to me is the primo smoothie.. Robek's is a very close 2nd and MUCH closer to home so they get the spur of the moment purchase vs. the trek (not that far really) to Jamba.  Oh, they do offer a AAA discount with your valid AAA card too!

Our 1st attempt to try this new eatery was their 1st weekend and was a disaster as they were completely over-whelmed and we walked after a long wait without even having a chance to order.  So a few weeks later we gave them another chance and well, it certainly was not as busy and got to order in a normal amount of time.  The food thou was just OK, the Tasty Asian Kitchen is MUCH better and was again just OK.

LOVE their pizza!!  We often go either before or after seeing a movie at the Harkins across the street and the wife and I typically split and enjoy their Cesar (small) and their Pepperoni pizza.  The Coal fired oven gives the right texture and flavor to their crust and the way they do the mixture of Pepperoni's (some spicier than the others!) and the Mozzerella make this a very enjoyable pizza!!

Disappointed... I mean, I expected much more out of this place.    Service - not very attentive.  Food - average if not slightly below. (should you have to ask for WHAT the menu says it COMES WITH?)  Atmosphere - nice, but rather sterile and cold (along with the seats under the A/C)  Pricey - yes, for what we got and the rather bland taste (Fish & Chips / French Dip).  Will we be back? - maybe - but not anytime soon.    The Yardhouse is hands-down a far superior place, service, food, quality and just all around better than BJ's.  As Simon Cowell would say... Sorry!

Sadly received this email today:  Sabatinos is Closed You know we have been experiencing a lack of sales which we can blame on the economy, new restaurants opening here in the valley (most likely for much less cost than us original places), we tried to work with our landlord, but he would not budge on lowering our rent. We just could not afford the 5500.00 this month and were afraid we would lose everything in our place to a Lockout, which was threatened to us already. We just wanted to say goodbye to all of our loyal customers, we really enjoyed having you come in weekly and keeping up with your lives as well as you keeping up with ours. We will probably be leaving the Az area and starting over fresh.   God Bless   Kevin and Sheri

Self and full service dog washing/grooming at your finger tips.  We did the u-wash with our dogs and they have a really good set up, have the supplies, ramp to the tubs for the dogs to walk (or be pushed up in our case).  Wash 'em, soap 'em (provided), dry 'em (Towels and blow dryer provided), leave the hair behind and pay with a cleaner dog in tow.  The owner really seemed to make sure we were pleased with their offerings.  http://www.seespotclean.com/

We enjoy Tagliani's several times a year and mostly really do enjoy it.  We have never had a complaint about their food (quality or certainly quantity!).  Occasionally the service is not a prompt as it could be but certainly nothing to avoid the place.  We almost always have leftovers and the pasta is almost better the second meal.  I see Alex's review was not as positive and I did not eat at the other locations to compare, but honestly if this is bad, the others must be even better?  :)  I don't think you will be disappointed with a visit to Tagliani's!

I love my Filiberto's and their food is always good, consistant and a good value.  Favorites include their Carne Asada burrito, the rolled taco's and on Tuesdays you can get .99 tacos (Beef or Chicken).  The staff is pretty friendly and they certainly remember me!  :)

We love going to Paradise Bakery and now we have one even closer to us in the Goodyear Centerpoint (Pebble Creek & McDowell).    Their food is very good, plenty for your $$ and different items on their menu.  Staff is normally friendly and they have a fequently visitor card to earn points too!  This location has outdoor seating and free Wi-fi as well!

"Airline food", that's what my wife equated our dishes it to.   This has to be the worst new opening on the westside in a long time! Fatty chicken, tracing paper thin cut beef in our combo was less than desirable to say the least.    Sorry Yoshinoya, but you have seen us the one and only time in your resturant.

Our favorite nursery by far, sure you can go to Lowe's or HD, but do you REALLY get plant knowledge?  At Elgin  you do and they have quality plants too! We have had very good luck with their plants and guidance.

Wifey and I went on New Year's Day (couldn't make it the eve due to family emergency) so we sat at the grill side table.  All in all very good, tasty, good sized portions, etc.  The cook was not the most chatty, but did provide good entertainment, cooked to order and no complaints.  A bit pricey, but then again, you get food and "entertainment".  We were somewhat disapointed to see the numerous flat panel TV's with sports all over, along with the NFL helmets on the wall.  We will be back for certain (especially now that since ~as of my drive by 10 minutes ago~ that Ichi-Ban on Litchfield is closed)!

3/6/15 - We went to celebrate my wife's birthday dinner and up until the very end,  we had a great time.....  It all changed when the short bald manager came to tell us to move.... As they need to turn the table....  The kicker was that we hadn't even gotten a bill yet.   Even after explaining this,  he mentioned again about moving. Easy to take a good experience and made it horrible!   When the bill came,  of course it wasn't via the manager,  so I told the server to send him back.   Upon arrival I clearly expressed my displeasure with this chain of events,  but honestly he couldn't have cared less.   I've never been asked to move, I understand it's a business but really...  Get your shit together,  you've lost customers over this one single horribly handled event.

LOVE this place, the tortas are very good and a good value too. The bread has this sorta sweet taste to it and really makes the torta pop!  Took my parents there when they visted and they hadn't had a "Torta" before and they really did enjoy something different!

"Very good bagels!!  plain and simple.  Good selection, multi item pricing (meaning by more spend less per), I love their Sausage egg bagel on their outdoor patio on the occasional Saturday AM.  Or the times I run here to grab a 1/2 doz, bring home and enjoy!"

We love this place, after moving from Seattle where Pho was easy to get we found ourselves lucky to have come across this one.  The owners (mostly family run) are very friendly, the food is very tasty, they have quite the following in the asian communitee (which should also speak well of their food).  I enjoy their grilled/sliced pork (i don't really get into the Pho) but my wife almost always get one of their many Pho dishes.  We have sent friends there as well and they also leave with the same feedback of good food at a good value.

We decided to try Taps for lunch yesterday as we wanted an outside lunch so what the heck right?  Glad we did, we enjoyed the patio/streetside seating in the sun.  Our waitress was not very good, but the food made up for it.  We look forward to coming back and trying it again!  They seem to have quite a menu and if you are a drinker a great selection to be found.  Their menu can be viewed at: http://www.tapsbars.com/Menus.aspx

Yesterday we had the opportunity to try Bryan's Black Mountain Barbeque - Cave Creek, AZ  and we REALLY enjoyed it!  Good flavor, variety, some surprised and really good food!  We had the dogs with us and that worked well on their patio out front.  LOVED the seating area around the saguaro, very unique.  We collectively had the brisket, pork, chicken sandwiches and a tomato sandwich as well.  They also had this funky watermelon treat that was really unique and really had depth of flavors.  We'll be back for sure and look forward to another meal at Bryan's Black Mountain Barbeque, maybe this time it will be in the evening enjoying more of the patio....   :)  TV story of them here: http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/morning_show/taste_of_the_town/tott_bryans_black_mountain_barbecue_06182010

It finally opened and the waits are crazy!!!  So we went last night, friends got there 1st, placed the name on the list, got the pager and off to Toys/Babies R Us for a little shopping (they needed Diapers).  So we come back, waiting outside after the short rain and just when you thought we had more time, off goes our pager...  Plowed thru the very crowded waiting lobby and to our table.    They were very busy, but the patrons seemed pleased, not unhappy faced seen.  Our server/service was a little slow, but considering how busy and new the place is, wasn't too bad.  Food was a tasty as we expect.  When the snowbirds go home (think Pebble Creek) the waits will shorten for sure!  We will certainly be back (love those breadsticks!!)

This was my first and tomorrow will be my last for a while....   The reasons:The list is long: - Parking (Cluster F on how this works and how FAR you end up parking. - Lack of signage/direction into the park and around the park until you're IN the park... - LACK OF SHADE - this park is turned with home being... get this NW so there is very little seat selection that gets or will get shade. - Pricing, they are the highest (I think) - Concession stands - don't get me started, I walked away after missing an entire inning and was still 6 people back! - Traffic OUT of there.... enough said.... after tomorrow's game (since we already have tickets and I love baseball) it will be a LONG time before I go back, maybe for a night game..

Finally decided to give it a try last night, and it is without regrets that we did.  I will say this... the wings and pizza were greasier than they needed to be, but good flavor was certainly found.  Plenty of TV's to watch your various flavors of sporting events and such.  Seem to have good happy hour and weekly specials.  We will come back again!

Attempted to have dinner here tonight (9/9/2010) but appears they were closed.  No signs confirming, but 630pm on a Thursday and not open makes one think they are gone.  - If I find this to be in error I will remove this review/comment.  We chose to go to India Garden on Dysart instead.

Well we came in with high expectations and left under-whelmed.... First off, it seems as if most of the food is reheated, yeah this happens but really seems to be the case here.  Then there was the greens and they were simply way too spicy.  Now don't get me wrong, we like spicy food, but we like to taste the food as well and the 1st time we mentioned it, "I actually season my greens for flavor..." was the reply when asked how we liked it.  The real issue was upon our departure was when we were asked again about how we liked it, we offered an honest opinion and again advise about the heat level of the greens "Our people season to flavor...."    Sorry last visit to Fitzi's with a comment like that.  Completely uncalled for and the food (and relative higher cost) not worth it.

We found our new (replacement) Irish pub after losing the Ol' Dubliner.  We came after a spring training game (saw an ad at the park) and we had the fish and chips, very tasty, not over greasy and good flavor.  The atmosphere seems spot on and we will certainly be back and try something else as well!

Wow, talk about sensory overload as you walk in... AISLES AND AISLES of liquid fun!  :)  The nice gentle scent of wine as you walk into the store and the nicer decor than Bevmo, not to mention the MUCH larger selection (can't wait for our TW&M Goodyear location to open this summer!)  Such a nice, large beer aisle to walk up & down, making the selection of a favorite beer or maybe one you haven't tried or even seen before.

Stangely this 5 & Diner isn't in a "diner" car, it's in a strip mall and is a little harder to find when you normally know what a 5 & D looks like.  The food seemed just as good, on this day it was slow (customer wise) but out food was timely and of good quality & taste.  Next time in the area we will certainly consider a repeat visit.

We had the pleasure of eat at Augie's tonight and glad we did!  Very good food and the pretzel buns are awesome!  I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and wife had the chili burger and we were both very impressed.  Good service, high quality food, more flat panel TV's that you could shake a stick at, very nice decor (even in the bathrooms!) We have a cat named Auggie so kinda cool to visit "her place" :)  We got to meet the owner and seemed very appreciative to have patrons (as he should) and seem genuine in asking for feedback on our meals.

My Friday morning treat, being from Seattle I have to enjoy Starbucks from time to time and Friday is normally it.  This is a drive-thru (and walk up) only location which for that time of day is perfect for me since I don't need to take extra time getting out, going in, coming back and then leaving.  Staff is always very friendly and pretty quick in getting your order ready.

So we have driven by numerous times and said "we need to try it sometime" and then I have some cop friends that eat there so it has to be good, right? Yes it is!  - Glad we finally stopped the other night, my vodka sauce on my dish was VERY tasty as was their marinara sauce.  Now their sausage wasn't quite to our liking (not spicy enough) but you might like it. Their pizza looks and smells great and next time we will get some Pizza for sure!  Family owned and run, so why not give them a shot? We'll be back!

We love going to Cost Plus and all the stuff they have to browse thru and try at home.  If you are looking for spices, food, coffee, wine, decor and supplies from the far corners of the world, this is a great place to get it! Also, love Wednesday "Double Coffee Points" day... with your frequent shopper card if you buy on Wednesday you get double credit towards your next free bag of coffee.  :)

Well this was a spur of the moment visit after dinner and really was so much better than I expected!  A word of advise thou, watch how much you put in your cup/bowl as the total unit is weighed (toppings/mixins and all) so it could get pricey!  They had 12+ different flavors of the yogurt and tons of mixin items to make it however you like!  I really did enjoy the Madagascar Vanilla and the Mango Pineapple yogurts.

enjoyed my meal tonight at KB, I enjoyed a pulled pork sandwhich and the wife had the pork ribs.  Sandwich was very tasty, tender and had good flavor - wasn't over sauced which was nice but they brought a side of sauce which hit the spot.  The toasted bun (YUM!) and the fries were pretty good as well.  I didn't have the ribs (OK I had a sample) and also seemed very good.  Very friendly place with "patio" seating too boot! We will certainly be back for more!

Very good food, comes pretty quickly, good portions with a side of attitude from your server (your attitude may vary).  They are only open for Breakfast & Lunch and is certainly with a visit.  You can tell there are many regulars that visit and enjoy TJ's and we will become one of those regulars as well!

So as a special treat for my wifes big birthday, I gave her a great gift from KK.  I took her there and let her work to design how she wanted her cake.  And it came out great! The raspberries in the cake, the chocolate ganache, the artistry and attention to detail, really made it special! We'll be back again on our next celebration and oh, if you can get a Pina Colada or a lemon chiffon cup cake, do it!

Good local business with some hard to find or unique finds.  They also have some different things for their customers and their pets, from rememberence items for pets no longer with their owners, to "Pride" related items for your dogs to "Chewish" dog toys for the Jewish community too.  Friendly staff and always willing to help.  They carry food, toys,treats along with various associated items.

OK so let me start by saying, "Why did it take us so long to find this gem?" Admittedly, we don't go down Central all that often, but when have, we've see Don Pancho's and thought, we should stop there.  Finally we did!    GREAT authentic food, along with the traditional Mexican us north of the border think of too!  Great carne asada, carnitas, a sweeter pastor, great selection of salsas and attentive service with very reasonable prices!!  We really love your place,your great food and personalities!

Tonight we tried La Bona Pasta and we really enjoyed it!  They just opened (used to be the Daisy Cafe) so they are still getting into the swing of things, but if they can keep the amount of business they had tonight, business will be good! I had the Carbonara and wife had the Pomodora and we both really did enjoy them.  We also had dessert Creme Brule' and Tiramisu and both are large enough to share, but both very good.  We will be back to try more dishes!

YAY!! The new location is open on the north side of 10 on Litchfield Road (the old Ichi-ban location) and the food was just as good as the south side of 10.  OK so the building doesn't have quite the same "character" as their original location, but that's OK.  The staff is just as friendly, the food as good and they kept 3 of the old Ichi-ban tapenyaki grill stations for fajitas grilling and tortilla cooking  .  We will certainly be back, but you do miss the old building a little, but this is now 1/2 way closer to our home!

It may be fry bread for some of their offerings, but very light fry bread, not heavy or greasy.   I got red Chile fry bread, wife got the Calabsitas soup, both were VERY good, full of flavor for the unique desert SW flavors and style of food.  We also sampled their green chile pork and potato soup too and wow! that was good and warning for those who don't like spicy, this would be one to sample before getting a bowl.  We will certainly be coming back to this great place with very friendly staff!

This is grilled and seasoned with a "port sauce" and I got to tell you, very tasty!  Everyone at our table had something different and all seemed to really enjoy their dishes as well.  The attmosphere is nice, not too loud, well lit, but not overly bright, their is a slight wood smoke smell (from their oven/grill which is a nice touch.  We will certainly be back.

We have been to Ben's a couple times now and glad we have found a local place to get Teriyaki close by (after moving from Seattle to PHX, it's hard to find here...). We have ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and the spicy Chicken Teriyaki Yakasoba and enjoyed both.  The regular Teriyaki is a little sweeter than we are "used to" but not so much so that we wouldn't keep ordering it.  I like that they are willing to customize your order and have been very friendly.  We'll keep coming back!

Ordering now, hope it's as good as it was in Buckeye!  (Will edit review after eating from new location) 1/26/2012 - Thanks for the reminder to complete the review.  Just as good, if not better since they are closer to home now!  - We ordered to go, we both chose the 2 meat combo's:  Mine - Pulled Pork & Chopped Beef, Wife's - Beef & Pork ribs with the sides.  All was very tender, flavorful and enough for 2 meals for each of us.  Normally I prefer pork, but the beef on this visit was more flavorful.  The ribs were meaty and tender.  The staff is friendly, the larger dinning room is a nice change from Buckeye as well.  We will certainly be back soon!

LOVE IT!  - We finally have a Five Guys near us so I had waited to try any FG's as we would have one soon.  I was very pleased and glad FG's is now here!  To me the meat wasn't greasy as fresh, not frozen meat which will always be juicier and have more flavor.  The fries are very good, note the "small fry" is plenty for 2+ people! Sure it's not cheap, but when is a quality product?  Regarding the noise, sure it's a bit louder, but with a busy open kitchen, hard flooring/ceiling surfaces this will happen.  Oh, love the Coke Freestyle machines!

We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time.

Pretty tasty bbq for sure, but the service was pretty slow (but did seem like they also had a catering gig at the same time).  Tender pork, good flavor and a sauce with gentle spice.  Good fries, the Mac and Cheese was just ok thou.  Good review on the coleslaw from table mate.  The sweet sauce seems to have more spice vs. their original.  We'll be back for sure to a nice family owned place.

Food was OK and less than OK and with as many rubs and sauces it's hard to really know on your first visit but it was either REALLY over coated or just not that "great".    I agree that the tables seemed "sticky" as others mentioned, they have no shortage of TV's which is great but not enough for us to drive back out to try again.

We've been several times now and have been very pleased each time.  They have some typical "American" Mexican food, some Sonoran and some other unique Mexican dishes from other regions which all have been well received by us and our co-diners.  It is a little noisy and the A/C can be a little fickle if you are right under a vent (but hey with AZ, i'd rather have cold A/C vs. none)

Great new addition to the west valley and so far so good.  The food has been really good, nice sized portions and some different menu options.  Nice beer and whisky selection too!

Thankfully another craft brewery in the much too dry West Valley.  The beers were pretty good, not stellar but not a waste of time (or cash either) but what I really enjoyed was their smoked pastrami sandwich - very tasty for sure and unique.  Wife really enjoyed her lunch as well.
