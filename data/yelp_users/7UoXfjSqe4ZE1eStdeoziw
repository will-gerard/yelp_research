This is my favorite Mexican Food restaurant. The guacamole is awesome. My husband likes the shredded beef tacos I love the green chile burros enchilada style with green sauce. I have tried many other things on the menu and they are all good! The salsa is great the people are friendly. It is clean and I always know what we are getting.

This is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company. The food is fresh and the service always friendly. If you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go. Fondue is fun! If you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening.

What happened to Mimi's? The menu has changed again and not for the better. We arrived at 9PM and no one was at the door to greet us...for a long time we waited, then I wen tin search of someone. Finally found someone and I asked if they were closed. He said no and sat us. The restaurant was pretty empty. I never saw anyone else on the floor working. The server was not friendly at all. Service very slow. Then again this might be a management problem too since one person cannot do everything in a full service restaurant and do a good job.  I ordered the chicken crepes. They were pictured on menu and looked good. I received a hot plate with cold food. They were actually cold inside so I am not sure if they sat that long or if they are premade and were not heated through.  It took a long time but I finally got the attention of the waiter and asked him to please heat them up.  He grabbed the plate and came back later with them hot. The crepes were still undercooked and mushy but the inside was hot.  The salad was wilted when he returned.  The waiter never said he was sorry or is it better or kiss my behind.  He just dropped it off and went away.  I did eat a couple more bites and decided that I was not willing to eat calories when the food is bad so that was the end of my dinner. My husband had the Tuna Sandwich and it was different then they used  to make it and no longer on the menu that he could find. We waited a long time again. Finally got his attention and asked for the check. He never asked if we wanted dessert or asked if I wanted the mushy mess to take with me, or at least ask what was wrong with it. We finally got the check, paid for it before he could take off again and left. Mimi's used be so good. Maybe the economy has made them cut down on labor to try to make a profit. The bad thing about that is you cut down on service too. I never thought I would prefer IHOP but the food is hot and the service is better.

We had not gone here for several years. Decided to try them again since El pollo loco was not open yet. Now I remember why we stopped coming. The chickens were the size of pigeons. The sides were not fresh but maybe because we were there early evening. It was very clean but pretty empty.

Love this place! The Scottsdale one has much larger chicken legs then the one on central unless it just happened to be a big chicken day. HAHA They just came out with a new menu and there are so many things I want to try but the Chicken and waffles are so darn good I end up getting those every time.  I have tried the sweet potatoes and they were really good too. Always too full for dessert but OMG they look good! Inexpensive pricing, fast service and they are open on Mondays too!

I have been coming here for years. The iced tea is out of this world and I would come here just for that. Spicy beans for an appetizer always pleases my husband. The kabobs have been a little tough here and there but not so tough you can't eat them. I love the Barg and the Gourmet Sobzy. Persian basmati rice is one of the wonders of the world and Tasty Kabob makes it so well that even my husband the non rice eater cleans his plate here. Topping things of with persian ice cream always ends the night with a smile. You can also take a bag of tea home with you to brew your own which is awesome. Ask the owner what the chef mixes in it to make it taste so good. She told me but I can't remember beyond.. I love it. There is rarely a wait here and always clean. The more we go, the more I want to return. This is a must try for those who like to try new types of food but great also if you bring a stick in the mud that likes meat and potatoes.  You will get rice instead but I gaurantee even a cowboy will love the Barg.

Get out the napkins and dig in. Be sure to try the hot pickles when you come in the door. They train their staff well and you always feel well taken care of here. The food comes fast and the portions are large. Prices are good too. It is always fun tasting the various BBQ sauces on  the table while you wait for your food.  I love the zesty and sweet and spicy. Smoked pork is awesome as are the ribs. This is one of our regular places to dine and I cannot remember ever having a bad meal here or bad service. I can see why they are always busy. It is clean, great food and great service. Yuppp...5 stars for sure Even the bathroom are nice! It is BBQ with style.Arizona Style

I love this place! We have to drive over the mountain to get to it so we do not get there as much as we would like but every time we eat here it is soooo good! There is no other great fried chicken place on this side of the valley. It is spicy and juicy and tender. The sides are good too. Peach cobbler and Sweet potato pie, lemon cake, pecan pie. Can you tell I like sweets? The dirty rice and coleslaw, even the fires are all reallllly good. We took my mom with us this time because she said she was craving some good fried chicken.  Her wish was granted. This is a family owned business and they really care.  Spend your dollars with local companies. More money stays in the state that way. This is one little out of the way place you will love. It is made mostly for To Go orders but we usually eat there while it is fresh since the drive is a bit long from Ahwatukee

This is a perfect place to have a brunch or lunch. the crepes are outstanding. Mostly a place for women to enjoy a late breakfast or lunch. Variety is good and everything is always fresh and clean.

Step over Krispy Kreme! Bosa has the best donuts I have ever eaten! You have to try the creme filled ones too!! A customer brought some in for my employees and I have been thinking of them ever since! My employees have too. Found the address and am driving across town  to get some more. They must use all the ingredients of the old days to taste this good.
