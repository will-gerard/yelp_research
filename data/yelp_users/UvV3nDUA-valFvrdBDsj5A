HORRIBLE! It has taken three weeks to get my washer fixed and the company gives you the run around. This company does not care at all about customer service! The technician, Tony, stood me up after I took a day off of work! The technician stated I did not answer my phone.  I missed his call and called back with in three minutes.  When i called the comapny back and spent 12 minutes on the phone with the company asking that they please send the technician they said that now it was 15 minutes and "outside the time window." I asked to speak with a manager and they said they would relay my message.  The company's motto is prompt reliable service. It is anything but! Don't use them. Fidelity should NOT use them!

First, sitting out on the patio is a must!! Second, the food overall was delicious- salmon, hanger steak, and the chicken.  All of us devoured it! We also loved the gazpacho! I may have also found a favorite drink! The Bison Invigorator! Made with a bison infused vodka and deliciousness!  A must try! Also, do not shy away from the little muffins in the bread basket. They were really moist and had a little kick! Great!
