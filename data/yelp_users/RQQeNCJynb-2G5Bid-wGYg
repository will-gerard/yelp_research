Ok, it is probably very rare that I will be handing out 5 stars that much because I'm just like that but this place really deserves it!!!!! Can I say heeelllllllloooooo heaven!!! I might have to say this is the first time I cleaned my plate (and pot). This place has just the right atmosphere for a good night out. The food was excellent and so was our waiter! I would be in trouble if they ever put one closer to me!!! Some people may say that their portions are too small but I have to differ, I never go home hungry and I never leave with that gut wrenching feeling of over eating!!!! I would take out a second mortgage and eat here every night!!!!

First of all my closet is bigger!! You go in turn around and you're out!! Since I had to come here, I was going to get some candy....they had my childhood favorite....Sixlets!!!! As i start picking up different candies to see which of the lame selection I would choose, the kid at the register (who should have been in school at the time) starts ringing up everything I pick up. Really!!!! I found this rude...and annoying!!! Oh, and he didn't even know the right prices. I will not be back!!!!

The only reason I give this 1 star is because they actually got my order right!!!  When I was sitting in the drive-thru, i noticed the guy didn't give me enough packets to suit my liking. So I ask for a specific number and, yes, he did put them in the bag. Guess who removes several of the packets!!!! The F*ing manager!!!! Not only that but I mentioned what he had done loud enough as I drove off and he heard and started laughing. I think someone needs a girlfriend!!!  Oh yeah, and we got sick from the food too!!!! yuck!

I'm not really sure how to rate this place. I got a steak, mashed potatoes and peas & carrots. Peas & carrots...nuff said, I was unaware that they accompanied the meal. My steak was so tough that running over it with my truck tire wouldn't even tenderize this thing!!!!! But....it had the best flavor. Now on to the mashed potatoes, once again good flavor but I could have made a shovel stand up on my plate they were so thick!

I've noticed that this place has gotten a majority of 5 stars, well that may be due to the awesome chicken with the tasty skin that you just have to devour, and the greens that had me picking up my bowl and consuming the goods like 3 year old, but can I get some room, please!  I'm knocking elbows with everyone around me. When I want to fully enjoy my meal I want all of it to go into my mouth, not down my shirt because the person behind me had to get up and shoved my chair right to the table. No elbows on the table here; there's no room!!!  oh, and the mac n' cheez is good and all but why is it after 2 bites I taste nothing but cream of mushroom soup and not cheese.....just a thought!  and that is why I give 4 stars and not 5......

This place was alright, I'm not a big fan of BBQ but I can hang with this place. I like that there is a selection of sauces on your table so every bite can be a new experience. I was especially impressed with the service! The wait staff were constantly checking on us and the manager came to us and gave us coupons and a free bottle of sauce because I was just so cute, just kidding hahaha, really because it was our first time. Good promo! I'll be back whether I like BBQ or not!
