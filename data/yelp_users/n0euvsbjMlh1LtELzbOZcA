WOW so fun.  I thought my nieces and nephews might be too old for this place but even the middleschooler loved it.  Lots of shows and photo ops and the performers were pretty lively and cool not all worn out like at some attractions.  Everything was pretty reasonably priced too, score!  Take the mine tour, its really neato!

This place is a big part of phoenix history with the elite wining and dining here for decades.  The decor is from another time, and in a good way.  they actually still do the old time fantastic service you dont get anywhere anymore and the food is always superb.  even if its just for drinks and desert you have to go at least once and you'll probably be back again if they treat you right like I know they will.

my favorite downtown coffee place.  The servers are fantastic and there is a big big big selection of teas some that i dont get at other places.  The food is super tasty and fresh and has a lot of good people watching seats. hooray for local owned shops!

This ol gal is gettin run down.  Its still one of the bigger parks in the city but every time I go its littered with bird poo and trash.  The rides and rentals get no use and the lake smells toxic at times.  If you work the afternoon right it can still be an enjoyable experience as the park is huge with many different areas.

I think the little kwik-e-mart pizzas taste a bit better than these.  I had both peperoni and just cheese and both were somehow both drippy with grease and really really really hard to bite through.

So so glad yelp reminded me about this place.  Its really a farm grill, on a farm and so fun to eat at.  I like to walk around the place after I'm done eating ribs and waffles for that old time feel.  Quaint, charming, and good eats nothing to complain about here.

There is no possible way to fit the mile high sandwich into a normal size mouth.  No possible way at all.  At first I said whoa $10 for a sandwich but   once I saw it I thought I was getting a deal.  Soup was so so and lunchtime seating is scarce but the food is tasty.

Dr Wells takes fantastic care of my pups.  I've vet shopped quite a lot and this is the only place that i haven't gotten the greedy vibe from.  They take their time explaining everything and will tell you the truth about what is necessary and what isnt without pushing expensive needless junk on you.   i ask a ton of questions and i've seen dr's with that annoyed look more times than I can count but tempe vet answers everything and sometimes even goes into more detail than even i was planning.  The exam fee is below average from what i've found and the new building - just around the corner from the old one -is a lot more modern and much much bigger.

Tried this new place out and I wont be going back.  The rice is the WORST.  Its the type of rice you typically see in Mexican dishes and really weird to have in both the chinese food and the sushi.  The veggies in the fried rice tasted like they were the frozen bag variety and just the usual carrots and peas, no bean sprouts or any other goodies.  Beef was chewy, but the chicken was OK.  Noodles were also decent.  Bad rice at an asian place is a deal breaker tho.
