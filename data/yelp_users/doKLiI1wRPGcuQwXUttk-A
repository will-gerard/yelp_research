Excellent experience, I would recommend Dr Larson to anyone with back pain. He really cares about his patients and goes above and beyond to help.

Never again will I go to this hospital that is 5 minutes from my house. Terrible experience, wont even get into the details.

I am shocked at how scary this place was! I had not ever been to this location, but needed a quick place to stop for food. We always like eating at the PV mall location, until it shut down. The complaint list is long; starting with food items that should be cold were actually warm, and the warm items were cold. The bins of food had other food items in them, for instance the sour cream, cheese, and butter were all almost empty but had lots of other gross items mixed in them as if they have been sitting there for hours. The ranch dressing was almost gone and some other dressings looked like they hadnt been stirred for a long time. There was food all over the counters, and the only time I saw a counter being wiped was when an employee leaned over the open containers of soup to yell at the top of her lungs back to the kitchen. The potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese. The pizza looked like a microwave pizza, undercooked and hard from sitting out for god only knows how long. We walked over to get soft serve ice cream and the area looked like a bomb had gone off, there was food everywhere! On a good note, the service was good, our server checked on us frequently and was very nice. But the unsanitary presentation of buffet style dining has my stomach churning too much to go back.

What a horrible experience we had at this resort from the moment we checked in. We booked 4 rooms for July 3rd with the intention of taking the shuttle over to Harolds for dinner and fireworks. 3 out of the 4 rooms were ready when we arrived at 3pm. We quickly put our stuff in the rooms so that we could get out to the pool. The couples room that wasnt ready they decided to just put their stuff in the other room while theirs was being finished. When we arrived at the main pool we were shocked at how small it was and how many adults guzzling alcohol were crammed in the pool. Every chair was taken, and we couldnt get a person to take our drink order as they all just buzzed by us while we stood there without chairs and sweating (it was 115 degrees). We then decided that the pool over by the villas would be better since it wasnt as crowded and we had two kids that would not even be able to fit in the main pool. Once we arrived at the pool at the villas we were greeted by an overly friendly meddling security guard that checked in on us every ten minutes. The front desk called, and the 4th room was ready--come get the keys. The resort itself is spread out so nothing is walking distance when staying in the villas. So, my friend drove back up to the front desk and got the key to her room at 415. When she arrived at her room there was someone already there, a lady that stated she took out all of my friends stuff out of the room and brought it to the office! They all went to the front desk to sort it out. Thats when the manager got in my friends face and said he was going to call the police and have him arrested because he was so upset. Uhm, who wouldnt be upset that someone got into their room and moved their stuff? After the keys were deactivated twice, they finally got the right keys. We ended up getting rained out at Harolds so we decided to come back to the hotel for dinner. While the food was great, it took an hour to get it and there were 3 other tables in the whole place! When we asked for the salads out first, the server replied "Ill try." She was very unfriendly, and frustrated even though they didnt seem busy at all. We tried our luck at their small overly priced buffet and recieved the same type of service. It felt like this desert hotel was more of a twilight zone of miserable people--none of us will ever go back there.

We hosted a happy hour event in the back room, and was fabulous. About 50 people came and they opened a small cash bar up just for our group. Dave the manager was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed from the time I booked the event until the time we left. Great service and everything about CL exceeded our expectations. We will be back for sure!

I keep going back to this place because I like it so much! Great atmosphere, service, and food. There is one thing that put me off during my last visit, and that was that they now use what seems to be canned chicken on their southwestern salad. This salad used to come with a nice piece of grilled chicken on top, but not anymore. Bummer!

I received a message from the owner right after I posted my review. He had great things so say on how my issues would be dealt with immediately, and he thanked me for my honest review. I will be going back to PVBC again, the food is too good and I appreciate the owner's professional response to my review!
