I've been going here for at least 12 years. They have great, friendly service, really good sauce with a spicy kick to it. The cheese crisp is fantastic (so simple yet so satisfying) and the tamales and chimichangas are very tasty; vegetarian versions are more to my liking because the beef in the enchiladas is a little dry but the sauce is good. Oh, and please get the Albondiga soup! Clear, tasty broth and lovely meatballs (just too few of them is all).   All of the food is about above average, but not too heavy like other Mexican places and for the price point ($10 for rice, beans, taco, tostada, and enchilada?!), it's verging on fantastic.

Not surprised that this place wasn't impressive. The food was cold or dry and stale. The salmon sushi had a weird taste to it. The variety of offerings is good but the quality is just lacking.

I give them a lot of credit for serving a wide variety of vietnamese dishes in a city that's easy for restauranteurs to take the easy route and do what's typical and still get enough business. The ca kho (caramelized clay pot catfish) and canh chua (sour soup with okra and taro stems) are hard to find in general,  popular in Vietnamese homes and done very well here. Never had their pho - suggest ordering their more atypical items!

Like the egg noodle stir fry a lot (they get it crispy, which is rare, it's usually soaked in oil), the sweet rolls filled with the custard are soooo delicious and I can't find them anywhere in so cal it seems. It's crowded and the place to be if you're an Asian living in this area and quite a fun experience if you're not (Asian ).Otherwise, it's pretty run-of-the-mill food and kind of pricey for the quality and location.

Cute and sweet Korean family running this place but really thought the donuts tasted like Safeway or regular grocery store donuts (got the chocolate long John and cruller). But I don't have an alternative go-to donut place so I guess this is my only option and it's not bad. Would rather support them than buy a donut at Safeway!

Great beer. A flight of 9 for $9 is GREAT. You get a little 4-6 oz tasting of each and we liked them all. My favorite was the peach ale. Had the beer battered fries and our party demolished it. Crispy and well seasoned. Friendly service and fun atmosphere.

In 'n Out is so much better and cheaper! The burger is tasteless (even with a ton of add-ons like guacamole and hot sauces or bbq sauces that they offer). The bun deflates after a few pinches. The caesar salad was DRENCHED in dressing...practically a soup of dressing.

For once, something lives up to the hype! We were seated within 5 minutes on a Sunday at 11 AM and proceeded to order their breakfast americaine and the chicken and waffles. Our coffees tasted amazing (I went down to the bakery to buy the beans right after) and was possibly the best blend I've had. My friend's waffles came out perfectly (crispy with generous specks of bacon and chive) and her chicken was so moist. I loved the maple syrup and vanilla bean butter that came with it. The ligonberry jam and butter that came for my brioche was really high-quality (I noticed it and wouldn't normally notice my butter and jam!) and my eggs were the most perfectly fried eggs I've ever seen - evenly fried, not too greasy. Fresh grapefruit juice, 6 crispy strips of bacon, and two sausages later, I felt sufficiently but not overly full, and appreciated the fresh and expertly cooked taste of each item we had.

I thought Lee's sandwiches is a really worthy chain...until I recently went to this location. I always stop by when we visit home from LA because it's supposed to be cheap and reliably good food like it is when I'm in Garden Grove near LA. But this place has tiny portions! Our sandwiches were a good 3-4 inches shorter, the large croissant was the size of a small one in Garden Grove...same prices because it's a franchise, but shouldn't that mean they have the same sizes too? So sad. Sure it tasted the same but half the appeal of Lee's is the wonderful deal you get!

Poor service. Everyone was milling about when our party of 7 walked in and no one wanted to do anything...this type of lackluster attention continued. The drinks were awful. $3 margaritas sounded too good to be true and my watermelon one tasted completely artificial like they melted a jolly rancher into it or something. Blech.

This was one of the best brunches I've had anywhere. The servers were very knowledgeable and eager to share their opinion on what's best on the menu. Honestly, everything looked appealing. The portions are fair, the prices even fairer, and the food all excellent. My waffle with two slices of bacon was the best waffle and best bacon I've had. Bacon was thick, not too fatty, and perfectly charred. Waffle had texture and crisp. Real maple syrup on the side :) The special chorizo, jalapeno scramble was nice and hot and spicy! Definitely coming back.

An amazing meal, that was also amazing because we had about $150 in voucher. I don't know if I would have sought it out at full price without a discount, but everything was impeccable. Good service, great food, and really beautiful restaurant. The interior walls are all huge stones that are sculptural and majestic all at once. The drinks were excellent, as was the dessert tower. I loved it.

These are not real French treats. I'm surprised some of the reviewers say they've been to Paris. First of all, they're not macaroons (those are Jewish coconut cookies) they are macarons (one "o") and these were the most amateur macarons I've seen. The feet are big (the feet are the rim of the cookie) and the cookie body itsself is airy and thin whereas a true macaron is light but doesn't actually have air pockets in it (the cookie dough is still present throughout). The filling is not ganache like it should be - it's a buttercream like you use for cupcakes.   Chocolate croissant was decent so I'll add a star for that.

I've lived in Italy for 6 months and can say that the food here is extremely authentic. That said, I'd rather eat it in Tuscany than in Las Vegas because the portions here are small and unsatisfying and more expensive -we paid $35 for each pasta dish and granted one was the one with 1 lb. of lobster, the other (which just had chanterelles and charred corn) did not have any expensive ingredient and was even smaller than mine. Portion size aside,  the flavors were just not that inventive or perfected, as you would expect from Batali. The "Paglia e Fieno" was really salty (the main flavor) and my spaghettini was rather bland. The calamari appetizer was delicious and leads me to believe there are other star dishes on the menu but when I go to a restaurant like B&B I don't want to have to hunt for what's good - it should all be impressive. Maybe asking too much, but who else to ask that from but Batali & Bastianich? I think I paid more for their names than their actual influence on the restaurant.

My favorite chai EVER! They source it from Nico's in Boulder, CO which is where I first had it. Love the Spicy Ginger. Espresso latte is smooth and strong as well. A+ service. Friendly and smart!

Went at 9:30 so maybe I should cut them some slack but they were out of all three of their regular pastas. Since I was hankering for pasta I ordered one of the two specials: butternut squash ravioli. The other was lobster vermicelli. The special lacked any kind of balance. It was overly sweet (butternut squash and a brown butter sauce and some sort of bbq pork shreds on top - sweet inside the pasta, covered in sweet sauce, and sprinkled with sweet meat? no, thanks) and all too mushy. Nothing crunchy to add texture.   Tried some pizza and it was whatever.

Tuna sandwich was gross. Couldn't finish it. Caesar salad was even worse. They put sauteed mushrooms in it? So weird. Overpriced too.

The same com tam as the location in Westminister...flavors don't suffer at all but the portions and price do a little. Still, delicious and cheap Vietnamese. Love their crispy eggrolls and their che ba mau.

Pretty good breakfast spot. I got the giant cinnamon roll was which in-your-face decadent but still enjoyable. I like the tangy creamcheese frosting. The entrees are huge and full of flavor. Great prices, great, quick service.

There's never a wait here and the lady who works here is sweet as can be. Her daughter is gracious and helpful as well. They're both thorough but fast. Good selection of OPI colors - overheard the daughter say she goes on pinterest to keep up on nail trends, which is great to hear. Waxing is fast and good too. I always get my eyebrows done here.

Will never go back to Subway. Good, flaky baguette, fresh ingredients, love the peppers and their own chips (perfectly thick, crisp, and seasoned).

I love that this LA girl found Intelligentsia in her hometown! The staff here are all very friendly and care about the craft of making coffee. I like the rewards system too! I loved the cubano and the caramel macchiato I tried. Neither are too sweet.

I loved this place but it may be because I love Asian Fusion places. I have to admit the only thing that we had that was fusion were the tacos. Otherwise it was straight up sushi which was good but a little overpriced for how uncreative it was. I want to try other dishes next time!   The server we had was excellent. She let us chill out in between ordering for each course, checked in just enough without bothering us too much, and constantly had our waters filled. The cocktails were excellent - I loved my frozen margarita.   Plus, the decor is great. It's a good mix of modern and southwestern prints and color without being too tacky or busy or cold. Price is on point for what you experience!

We had a wonderful meal with attentive service. They give you a taste of wine before they pour you a glass, which is typical, but what is not typical is the friendly attitude encouraging you to try another wine if you're not 100% satisfied with your first choice. The breads were great, the seafood tower was amazing, and the dessert options (we got an array) were all impeccable. I love the design of the place and the fact that it's not too loud.
