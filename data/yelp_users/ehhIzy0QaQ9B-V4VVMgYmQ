View is fantastic. The atmosphere is fun. The service could be better, but it would be hard for the food to be any worse.  Seriously you'll get better food at Carl's jr. but you'll pay Steakhouse prices.

A hot dog, is a hot dog. Unless it's Ted's.   Seriously there is black magic going on here. Apparently they start by getting a super high quality dog mad for them back in Buffalo, then they beat the heck out of it above open flame! Seriously they poke and slice the dog up while it's being grilled over white oak charcoal and it picks up all that smokey goodness while cooking.   There are two other shining stars at Teds. Their house hot sauce and the Loganberry drink. The loganberry is basically glorified koolaid, but man is it good. The hot sauce is more of a relish and is unlike any other I have had. I'm not really sure what's going on in it, but it's just a little spicy, sweet and awesome.  Their cheese is straight up east coast style cheese sauce. Basically cheese wiz. If you like that sort of thing go for it. The chili is that midwest no beans kind. Not my thing, but that's fine. I always get the jumbo all beef topped with mustard, relish, onions and the hot sauce.   Everything not fried is cooked over that same white oak charcoal, so it all picks up that goodness. That means if you're not feeling a hotdog, everything else is going to be sold, but keep in mind "Hot Dog" is in the name of the place. Don't expect for their burger to change your world.  Last time I checked their were 8 locations. 7 in Buffalo, NY and this one.

Ahhhh Yeahhhhh...   Best Mediterranean I've had in AZ. Chicken Shawarma, Gyro, Humas, Tabouli, Falafel... All Amazing.   When you first walk in you don't know what to expect. Don't let that dissuade you. It's part Mediterranean market, part restaurant. Very much a bodega. I usually just odder takeout, but they have a sit down restaurant as well.

Straight up best hamburgs in Tempe. Fresh beef grilled over mesquite charcoal  Simple and straight forward. No gimmicks.   I've been coming here since I was a kid with my family. 25 years. This Temple classic has stayed true to it's roots.   One complaint. There is a guy who's always working there, usually on register, who is a complete A-hole. Aside from his crappy attitude the place is perfect. Thankfully you only have to deal with him for a minute while you pay or get frys.

A long time Tempe staple, Restaurant Mexico is true gem.   This is not Northern Mexico/Sonoran food. These are of family recipes from the region around Mexico City. All of these reviews claiming inauthentic food and from dumb know-it-all's that have never had anything but sonoran style.   The food is spiced very differently. Words like quesadilla refer to something entirely different. Once you let go of your filibertos based preconceptions you are in for a treat!  I usually recommend the #5, #6 or Clare Burro for first timers. Either of the combos will treat you too the incredible chorizo. This delicately spiced meat is much more subtle in spice and more finely ground than its boarder land counter part. The #5 will offer the chorizo atop a tostada, while the #6 will present it on their sope. Here a sope is sort of like a tostada with fried masa instead of a fried tortilla. Finally the Clare Burro is a whole bean burrito with avocado, an amazing house green sauce, and the always spectacular white Mexican cheese.  Restaurant Mexico is not a gastronomical hipster adventure. It is not a sonoran greasy spoon. Restaurant Mexico is deep central Mexican comfort food. It is your abelule's kitchen.

Just fantastic. I first went to Cornish Pasty in 05' a few months after they opened and fell in love immediately. Although a few things have changed over the years each one is usually an improvement and never a negative.   If you are not familiar, a pasty is a traditional British coal miners food.  A hearty filling wrapped in a pie crust and baked. Kind of a hand-held meat pie. Cornish Pasty Co. has taken this simple and traditional dish and meticulously perfected each component. Their crusts are some how simultaneously hearty and flaky. Although their is nothing delicate about their seasoning it is never out of balance and all of the ingredients are always quality.   Beyond just mastering the finer details of pasty science, Cornish Pasty Co. has also branched off into wild and exotic flavors. It's no shocker that the British know Indian food and it shows with the tika masala and the lamb vindaloo pasties. What is shocking is the refinement of the Greek and Italian inspired pasties. Perhaps my favorite pasty, from the cuisine most elusive to the British, is the Carne Avadado. This is a Mexican inspired pasty that will satisfy even the most snobby Las Cruses/El Paso foodie. If you have ever talked Mexican food with one you will know just what I mean.   I have eaten nearly every item on the menu and not a one disappoints. It took me ages to get past the pasties and start ordering soups and salads. Now that I have had the spinach, mushroom, walnut soup, it is difficult to save room for my old favorites.   Although the mine shaft inspired interior is dark and cramped I have never felt uncomfortable there. The sound system is usually bumping classic rock and the employees are pierced and tattooed well beyond your typical wait staff, but everyone is friendly and service is typically good.  If I have to list a negative the only one I can think of is the food is consistently just a little better at the University location than the Dobson one.  No clue why, but everyone I've talk to seems to agree, the Tempe store has the edge on quality.    After you add a respectable selection of beers the only reason you won't be here every night is your waist line.   Edit (4/30/2014):  Food's still good... but...    The service has gone down hill. What was once a staff of edgy, unique, and skilled individuals. They are now mostly pretentious hipsters, with a bad attitude and below standard skills at basic service.

The "Breakfast Torta" with chorizo was fantastic. Some of the best chorizo I've ever had. The "Good Morning Breakfast Burrito" w/ chorizo was not as good. In this item the chorizo was burnt and their were hardly any eggs.   It was interesting since we got both items at the same time. I only mention the burrito as a point of caution on this item, but the Torta was so good I can't wait to come back and try other items.

Great staff, Great atmosphere, Great beer program, Great people.   The food... it will get you by if you need to eat something with your meal. There was a time when I would come here for the food. That has long past.   I would easily give this place 5 stars for the Staff and Beer. 4 for atmosphere... 2 for food though. Step up the game on the food and you'll be five stars sold again.

Very disappointing...   I have been coming here for years and the quality has been consistently declining. Today may have been the final straw.   The last time I was here was with my girlfriend. We were seated on a hot day at the only table receiving full sun. The table was also rickety. When asked about moving the table or going to any of the other empty tables in the shade, we were told it was okay if we moved the table our selves.... Okay... The server was very nice, but very slow and forgetful. We ordered a coffee and a side of jam with the food. It took about 25 minutes for the food to arrive which is reasonable, but the server didn't check back once in this time. When the food arrived, no jam and still no coffee... fine it happens, not a big deal. So we ask the food runner to let our server know about the missing items... 10 minutes later she stops by, and we let HER know about the missing items. She scampers off and it is literally the last time we see her. About 5 minutes later the coffee is dropped off by someone else, and...still no jam.   At this point we have eaten everything except for the toast. My girlfriend still wants the jam so we ask for that... it arrives about 5 minutes later again. We finish the toast in a couple minutes and sit with an empty table for another 10, Until the general manager stops by with the check for us. We let him know about the issues we had and he says one word, "okay". Leaves the check and walks away. Pathetic.    To be fair the food was really good. That time...  I should say that I have worked in restaurants for 10 years. I have worked as a server, a bartender, back of house, and management. Virtually every position. I am very understanding and very forgiving. I tip well and generally try to make the staffs lives easier.      Today I was sat at the bar and service was fast and friendly at first. I ordered the two egg breakfast. An item I have ordered a dozen times. The item I ordered in the story above in fact. Unfortunately, the toast came out almost soggy. It was cooked on the griddle on one sided only. The griddle side was soggy with butter and the other side was completely soft and uncooked. Not a big deal I think, it has never come out like this before. It always has some crispness to it, even if they "toast" it on the griddle.  A couple minutes later the general manager walks by and asks how the food was. I let him know about the toast. He says one word "okay", then turns around and calls back to the kitchen to get another order of toast. Sure enough it comes up exactly the way it came out before. The server checks back this time. I pick up the toast and show her how it bends in half if you hold it on one end. It is obviously greasy and soft.   I try to explain that I've never had it this way before and I'm really not feeling it. I suggest that they may need to check whats going on with the ingredients or the kitchen. Instead of asking what they could do to make it right, offer something else, or offer to take it off the bill, she looks at me annoyed and says "Okay". They didn't even apologize. The GM was standing behind her listening to this interaction the whole time. It's just pathetic. On top of it the rest of the breakfast was disappointing as well this time, for example the hash browns were soggy and barely warm.   I know how to run a top notch front of house staff. Keep them happy and make the customers come back. The whole time I was just itching to step in and start fixing their problems. It is clear that the problems in the staff are coming from the top. I sure the GM has plenty of talents, but running a half way decent front of house staff is not one of them.   Because I have had enough decent meals here I could be coxed into coming back, but it would probably take direct outreach from the GM or owner at this point.

Normally I wouldn't like a place like this. Calculated atmosphere with a "Hip, Trendy, Urban Feel". It could easily come off as disingenuous, but it doesn't! The heart is here. The food is usually marvelous. The space is "modern" but not shallow and soulless.     If I had to complain... the success and location brings in hoards of the more obnoxious ASU greek life types on the weekends. After you make your way through hungover bro-dogs and sorority girls, you will have a great meal.

I am a foodie. I pretty much any type of food. I am not vegan or vegetarian. Although I try to be healthy, I indulge less than healthy options if they are tasty.   That said. Desert Roots is amazing. It's simply some of the best food in Tempe. It doesn't matter that it is vegan and healthy. It doesn't matter that you feel great after eating it. What matters is it tastes DELICIOUS.    Leslie, the owner, puts so much heart into her dishes and it shows. I wish I still worked near by here. I would be in much more often.

Very very friendly staff. I would come back for this reason alone. Lucky the food was excellent too.   I was only passing through town on my way back to phoenix, but I was so impressed that I bought a gift card for my foodie friend who is moving to Las Vegas this month.   I know I will be stopping here when I come up to visit my friend.

Good food. Loud echoing atmosphere. Services staff that was clearly hired only for their image.  Seriously bad font of house staff. 25 minutes to get my check after I asked for it. The bartender at the bar before being sat was rude. The staff didn't know the product very well. They were mistaken about several of the beers  (styles, taste, ect.) and couldn't answer simple questions about the food. The food was very good though. Credit to the back of house, they know what they are doing.  For such a polished looking operation at those prices I expect better from the front of house staff. At least they are pretty if nothing else.
