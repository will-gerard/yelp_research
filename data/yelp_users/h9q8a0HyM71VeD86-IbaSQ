I went to Fate because I had been hearing from people for a really long time that it was just a fantastic place and I really should try.  It happened to be right by the Roosevelt where we were actually going to meet up with some of you Yelpers.  You know who you are people.  Hi guys!  It was fun!  We parked and walked up and went inside.  The decor was nice. It seemed to have a decent atmosphere but I am not the type to be suckered in by all that crap.  If a place sucks, I don't care how chic the atmosphere is.  I will call a spade a spade.    The place wasn't full, quite the opposite really.  Maybe 2 or 3 tables were occupied.  So we go up to the hostess and tell her we'd like a table for two and she says that it'll be about 5 minutes which I am fine with but when I ask her if we can wait in inside she says "No.  Please wait outside."  What the fuck is that about?  I could understand if they were super busy and they didn't have any open tables for us to even sit at putting us in the way but if it weren't for the damn techno-look-at-me-I'm-cool music they were playing, you could hear crickets chirping in this joint.  Strike one!  So we go outside and wait.  She comes out after awhile and gives some other people that are waiting some drinks then tells us she'll be right back after she goes and grabs a couple of menus.  They must keep the menus in the parking lot or something because it took her awhile to come back.    She sits us in this corner that's pretty much hidden away from everything.  So here we are eating in a restaurant that I'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen.  Oh woe is me!  Woe, woe, woe is me!  However will I earn my cool points for the month?  The waitress was very nice and attentive.  I'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker.  I realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much.  Strike two!  We order a couple of $4 Republic of Teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu.  The variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness.  As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't do sweet.  So I order the Cantonese Dragon Beef and my significant other orders the Szechuan Chicken.  The waitress comes back with the pot stickers.  They sucked.  They were identical to the ones you get at Costco.  They are just like the ones they serve at Casey Moore's during happy hour only there they're free.  Here they cost $6.  I eat one and that's it.  Strike three!  Then comes the entrees.  Decent sized portions.  I can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  Mine was in a word, crap.  The best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird.  I didn't even like the mushrooms.  I am a mushroom fanatic.  If there are two things on a menu that both look awesome and one has mushrooms and the other doesn't, the mushrooms always tip the scales.  But they didn't even save this dish.  I am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four.    So in my disappointment I decide to give my girlfriends Szechuan Chicken a try.  Baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now.    So now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish.  This thankfully was perfectly adequate.  Now if I go to a fucking CHINESE restaurant and the best compliment I can give the food is "At least they didn't fuck up the rice", we are in some ugly territory here people.    If you're looking to go to some hip chic place cuz you want to here the latest spins from DJ Such and such, skip Fate, hit up Hunan Express and then just go straight to Myst or Drift or where ever the shiny shirts happen to be on that given night.  Nuf sed.

I've always considered myself a bit of a dive bar aficionado.  I love the complete and total lack of pretension that comes with them.  They exist for one reason and one reason only.  To get you fucked up.  That's why I was so pleased to find this little gem just stumbling distance from my house.  Emphasis on the word "find" because you would never notice this place if you weren't specifically looking for it.  It's a tiny little hole in the wall sandwiched between a scuba school and some little collectible shop that doesn't look like it's been opened since Nixon was in office.  You have to park around the back.  When you walk in there's a bar a few tables, a pool table, a jukebox and that's it.  They don't a have a shit ton of TV's broadcasting every sporting event this side of hell. They don't serve food. They serve drinks and that is it.  As it should be!  They pour em strong and they pour em cheap.  It's not a place you go to to pick up chicks.  They cater to professional drunks who have no illusions about why they're there.  That's what a good dive bar should do and they do it well.  I look forward to many a night spent in it's dingy throes.  They take cards but there is a $10 minimum.  Hope to see you there!

Excellent tacos and their homemade salsa is the best. The burritos are fantastic too.

I'm not the most prolific yelper in the world.  As a matter of fact I only feel the need to do it on the two extremes of "This place can link the sweat off my taint." or "Holy shit!  If you weren't food I would totally fuck you!"  So with that said I am happy to say welcome to the best fucking restaurant on Mill Avenue.  I know that's not quite the most ringing endorsement given the shit that exists on Mill these days but just take my word for it, I would totally fuck the food if it wasn't...you know...food.  Are you listening to what I'm saying FATE!?!  Suck a dick you perpetratin ass wanna be restaurant.  You should send some people down here to learn how it's done.  Nuff sed.  So anyways Dragonfly is a Vietnamese restaurant that just opened on Mill on 9/16.  I've eaten at their sister location in Mesa which is also excellent but this place wins hands down because a) they have a lunch menu (details to follow) b) they sell booze (full fucking bar, no joke) and c) it's like 5 minutes from my house.  It's the trifecta, the hat trick if you will, the elephants eyebrows, the eels hips, the bees knees, the gnats whistle...you get the point.    First let's start with the service.  It was impeccable.  Very attentive. Very friendly.  I'm aware that when a restaurant first opens they all try to kiss your ass so let's just hope that this holds out.    Next let's move on to the food.  The awesome lunch menu which is only $7.50 includes either the soup of the day or a green salad with a vinagrette dressing.  I went with the soup which was a very tasty asparagus and crab soup.  Asparagus and crab.  Before you even get the main course.  For $7.50!  Needless to say it was delicious.  You can't really go wrong with those two main ingredients in my book.  We also ordered the traditional spring roll for $3.95 which consists of rice paper rolled around shrimp, pork, vermicelli and mint leaves.  Dip that in the spicy peanut sauce that comes with it and try and tell me it isn't fucking awesome.  Go ahead.  Do it.  I wanna see you try.  That in and of itself could be a light lunch for a lot of people.    Back to the lunch menu.  So anyways for the aforementioned $7.50 you can choose between an assortment of pho (traditional Vietnamese soup) or a variety of sandwiches or a couple of salads or a spring bowl or rice plate.  We got the Pho Tai which contains lean beef and round eye steak.  They bring you a little side plate with bean sprouts, mint leaves, jalapeno and lime which you use to dress it up to your specifications.    It is delicious.  I was there with my old lady and since I know she's reading this, I mean my young, gorgeous beautiful lady.  Happy now darling!?!  And we both got the same thing and all we could do was talk about how good it was from the moment it hit our table.  The conversation consisted of shit like "Imagine how good this is going to be when it's cold out."  Her reply "Or when you're sick."  My thinking "Holy shit I can't wait to get sick cuz this shit would so rock the hell out of a cold!"  That's right I wished for illness just so I could experience the soothing effect this soup would have on a cold.    I know I'm totally building this up too much.  I'm really, really biased because I love Vietnamese food and this place is just as good as it gets when you're talking Vietnamese but regardless of all that it really is just damn good cuisine that you can't beat for the price you pay.  I highly recommend it.  I have yet to hear anything negative said about the one in Mesa and this one just managed to raise the bar.  Please go and check it out.    That is all.  Thank you.

Beaver Choice.  Let's just get this out of the way.  I don't know what the name means, I have no idea why it's named that, I don't know why the logo is a beaver (the animal kind - get your heads out of the gutter people) in a Swedish triple crown shirt holding a fork.  With all that said, what I do know is this place is definitely worth a try.    I had never heard of the place until my girlfriend fiancée sent me a link saying we should check it out sometime.  I checked out the menu online, it looked good, so rather than wait several weeks for my fiancée to have a free lunch period, I decided to investigate for myself that very same day.  Good move on my part.    It's a great little Scandinavian restaurant that's only been open for a couple of weeks in a pretty non-descript suite in the strip mall behind Ted's Hot Dogs at McClintock & Broadway.  It's a very clean place with about 6 or 7 four tops, furnished from top to bottom by...you guessed it...Ikea.  It's a family owned and operated spot and they are some of the sweetest people you will ever meet.  They are very proud of their little piece of Scandinavia in the desert and it shows in their service and their food.    They are well aware of the fact that with the exception of Swedish meatballs, most people aren't really familiar with Scandinavian food so when you approach the counter, right off the bat they ask if you would like to try a little sample platter free of charge.  Who's going to turn that down?  I had a little piece of Gravlax (raw salmon cured in salt, sugar and dill), some potato salad and some pink lunch salad thing the name of which I forget.  I really enjoyed the Gravlax and potato salad but the pink one was made with sour cream and since I've never been a fan of sour cream I only had a bite of that one.    They have two menus. One could best be described as a lunch/to-go menu and one that they call the bistro menu which is essentially akin to a dinner menu except that you can get anything on it all day.  They have salads, wraps, sandwiches, soups, entrees, etc. with all kinds of different varieties of meats to choose from.  They even had two that they say on the menu are recommended for hangovers.  My kind of place! It all ranges in price from about $5 for sandwiches and wraps up to about $15 for a couple of the full sized dinner entrees though most of the dinner entrees mostly hover around $10 which is a steal for the amount of food that you get.    I decided to try the schnitzel.  It comes with a decent little side salad with your choice of either a honey mustard or garlic vinaigrette, a little citrusy red cabbage slaw both of which were good but were primarily there to compliment the main event which was the schnitzel.  It's an enormous breaded pork cutlet stuffed with ham and brie cheese, cooked to perfection and topped with an amazing mushroom gravy and on the side were dill mashed potatoes also topped with the gravy.  Both of them were in a word, delicious.  It was about $11 for the whole entrée and it was worth every penny.  I wasn't able to finish the whole thing but I can tell you that it keeps really well because I had it for breakfast this morning.    I haven't tried anything else on the menu but if any of it is even half as a great as the schnitzel, it's gotta be pretty damn good.    You know how every now and then you go to a place that's just starting out and you get great service and great food and you just hope that they make it?  Well this is one of those places.  I strongly suggest that you go check it out.
