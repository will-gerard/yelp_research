An unusual combination of Asian and seafood/Italian pasta, but it works!  Small, cramped restaurant which apparently is always busy - which I can understand. This is a small neighborhood restaurant, which has been around for quite a while. But the service was pretty good considering the crowd. I did have to ask a few times for water, and one person in our group had to wait longer for her entree than the rest of us.   But, oh my, the food was DELICIOUS!  I had the Cajun soft shell crab appetizer, and the Calamari/Garlic/Anchovy/Marinara pasta, both were yummy. I also had a taste of my friend's Nabeyaki Udon noodle soup - full flavored, full of mixed seafood.  I finished with the blueberry cheesecake - not your typical cheesecake, it was a baked cake with layers of cheese, graham crackers, and blueberries, topped with a bit of whipped cream.  I will DEFINITELY be going back.

I have been going to Sassy Glasses since I moved out here, about 4 or 5 years.  I originally went for their frame selection - which is FANTASTIC! I think of eyeglass frames as jewelry, and since I need them on my face 24/7, I always have a few pairs. (You wouldn't wear the same pair of earrings every day, would you? Well, ok, I wouldn't).  They definitely have the coolest frames in town - not necessarily the trendy boring 'names'; these are mostly European & Japanese cutting-edge style, but with enough 'interesting' basics for your everyday pair.  They are locally-owned, unlike most other shops in the Valley. And to the previous reviewer who said they do not make their own lenses - well, I have news for you, I don't think I've EVER been to a shop that DID - even when I lived in NYC and Boston - at least for my prescription, which is a VERY complicated one, prisms and astigmatism and progressives and diopters. No matter where I've lived, my lenses ALWAYS take a week to order and receive.  Which brings me to - Ouida & Dan take the TIME to make sure they have my prescription and measurements CORRECT, unlike another nameless chain place I went to here in the Valley once (and will never return to).  They KNOW what they are doing.   And they are really really nice, unlike some of the snobby shops so prevalent in the Valley. Have been in a few of those places to browse and I felt like I was being scoped out as to whether I could afford the frames or something! (and I try not to dress like a schlump). And I have no confidence that those places would get my lens correct, anyway.  S.G. even made me a special pair of glasses to wear for when, as I normally do, sit with my laptop in my lap with the TV on, with the progressive line moved way up so I could see both.  Sassy Glasses IS a bit pricey, but I've discovered (see above) that you get what you pay for, at least on the lenses. Which is why I am a long-term customer.

Excellent sushi and service! Big selection, lots of specials. Neighborhood sushi restaurant that is better than many others in Scottsdale. Only drawback is that it's small & gets crowded easily.

I've often driven by here, & figured I'd go in & take a look sometime.  But I was looking for a clock-mini-speaker system that I use with my iPhone 4.    When I had my 3G, I had a very bad experience where I was assured that a particular clock-mini-speakers I bought would work with it - but all it had was a cheap plastic adapter that the 3G kept falling out of - & then they gave me a hard time about a refund.  This time, I was again getting either glib reassurances & non-specific information, "sorry out of stock"s, or  NO OPEN floor samples I could look at, at 3 other stores (including the big A Store with a lot of Jobs), not to mention conflicting info on Amazon & upon Googling.    So I thought to go into the iStore. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! They had open, plugged in items that I could actually test my iPhone 4 in to make sure it worked. Even better, I began chatting with the guys there about various other iPhone &  MacBook Pro issues, & found they had FAR more knowledge about BOTH the phone & it's peripherals and MacBook Pro's (and HONESTY about them) than I ever got from the "really-really-smart" folks at the Big-A-Store-with-Jobs who will promise you anything.   So, I would definitely go back there for honest advice & I would certainly bring in anything that needed warranty service.  They also have a pretty nice selection of peripherals and better yet, they know WHAT WORKS WITH WHAT!

Tired fish, old rice, and terrible service ( my order came 1/2 hour after my dining companions), and when it finally arrived it was missing one of the items I ordered. Some other people in our party left due, they said, to the smell of the place. I can't deny the place DID have an odor.  Waited 45 minutes for the check,. Worst yet, I had terrible diarrhea the next day.  DON'T GO THERE! Your bowels and plumbing will thank you. PS - my understanding is that this restaurant is under new ownership. They better get their act together ASAP.

they've been doing the AC service at my house since the previous owner. I bought the house 9 years ago, and had them put in an all new Trane system 6 years ago to replace the previous nearly-20 year old system. So, last night I came home to a rather warm house. Air was blowing but not cool. I called them and they said they would call me first thing in the morning. They did call at 8:30AM and were here at 9AM, just when they said they would be. Parts (blown capacitor) & labor were in the warranty, I just had to pay for an after-hours call, since it's Saturday. I highly recommend Scottsdale AC; they are one of the few businesses I've dealt with out here that call back in a timely manner, and actually show up when they say they will, and get it fixed.

Came home to a HOT house on a Friday night, called S'dale AC at 9PM, spoke to the answering service. Scottsdale AC called back at 8:30AM Sat morning to say they would be here at 9AM, which they were. Hector said it was the capacitor, which was covered under my warranty, so I only had to pay for the weekend visit.  He did the job and I am now cool.

A Lifesaver! I found Ginny's Wash House 5 or 6 years ago when I first came to the Valley.  I lived in a rental with no washer/dryer in the unit, and the common area units were ALWAYS busy.  I found Ginny's and I have to tell you their service is fantastic!  Dropped my clothes off, they asked for my preferences on washing, and they were clean, FOLDED (I HATE to FOLD!) and waiting for me when they said they would be.  So, when I had a hand injury recently and couldn't bear the thought of folding a mountain of washed laundry, I brought the mountain to Ginny's.  And yep, they did it again! Clean, folded and waiting for me when they said they would be.

YUCK! Why does everyone rave about this place? The pizza crust is TOO thin - it was SOGGY!  And they cut a ROUND pizza in SQUARES!!! WTF??? So I wound up with little weird-shaped outer pieces, and two large SQUARE center slices that were SO soggy that they just hung down when I tried to pick them up. Soggy and greasy.   The cheese and mushrooms were good, but the sauce was indeed WAY too sweet as others have noted, and the so-called 'crust' was nasty and mushy. This is NOT Chicago pizza! I've had pizza in Chicago, deep dish AND regular, and this was NOT like any of it.

EXCELLENT food and service! I went first for the Wednesday night wine tasting dinner. Second time for a late lunch. This time, I had the butternut squash soup & the kale quinoa salad. Both were excellent. Nice wine list, too.

This UO is by far superior to the one on Mill Ave. Tempe. Much better selection, better organized, neater, better service.

Just wanted to add my own experience to the glowing reviews. We came here for the "happy hour", aka The Pour at Jade, from 4PM-6PM. A very nice selection of drinks for $6, and a selection of appetizers also for $6 each.  We shared the chicken quesadilla and the homemade potato chips. BIG plates of each, couldn't even finish the quesadilla, brought home 2 of the slices for the next day, and it was yummy - even came with a nice sized side of guacamole.   As said in other reviews, lovely atmosphere, not a loud boisterous crowd - could actually TALK there. Beautiful view of the mountains north of us on the patio, and lovely grounds to walk on. Staff we met on our stroll were very friendly and courteous, not snobby as we thought they might be.   It IS a small bar/patio - might be best to go on a weeknight. Free valet parking -  well, you really SHOULD give a nice tip to the valet! The afternoon we went, the crowd was, from what we could tell in the Jade, Spring Training guests and also locals, judging by the cars we saw in the lot. Would definitely be a nice 1st or 2nd date place.

Yo Pauly's is the closest I've found in the Valley to "northeastern" style pizza (i.e. NYC/Boston-non-PizzeriaRegina style) that I've found.  I have to admit that I'm not crazy about their entrees, and I've tried several of them, so I'd stick to the pizza.  The owner is (mercifully) not a Yankees fan - he's a Mets fan, so that's good, and he's very friendly in that Noo Yawk way.  As others have said here, it's really not a place to sit down and a quiet meal, it's definitely geared for takeout.  Glad to have a decent pizza place just down the street from me!

It's not "Asian" food at all, it's (someone's) "Asian food concept". I thought everything was either bland, or hot for the sake of being hot - no complexity in the flavors.  Most ESPECIALLY if you're from the Northeast or California,  I think you will be sorely disappointed.  (Now I must tell you here that I am a "traditionalist" - being from NYC & Boston, and having family in San Francisco, that is the yardstick I go by.)  Also, their menu is written slightly cutesy - which I usually find annoying, and even MORE so in a Chinese restaurant.   "Chop-Chop Lunch Specials"?   It's definitely a chain-style restaurant - and we already have PF Chang's up the wazoo here in the Valley. I didn't have any problems with the service, but I've only been there on weeknights.  Twice. Won't bother again.

The Container Store is SO much better than the (other) storage store that used to be in Sonora Village off FLW & Pima! (the 'other' store has since closed). I used to go to the Container Store in MA and before that, in NJ, so I was very disappointed when I moved here and found there were none. And, so excited when they DID open one!  I have waaay too much stuff, and never have enough places to put it, so I am always buying stuff to put my stuff in, and squeezing it in with what I already have. If I can't find the exact size item I need at Target or Walmart, Container Store is where I usually CAN find it.  Whenever I go there, it takes me at least an hour - I simply must browse down each and every aisle, and always find interesting solutions.  They have great traveler's accessories, too, btw.  It IS somewhat pricey compared to Target & Walmart, but as I said, the selection and quality is better, and I have always found the staff to be very helpful (sometimes TOO helpful, they can get annoying asking over and over if I need help).  You can also pre-order online and pick up at the store, if you want to get out quickly and avoid the temptation of browsing....!

I used to go to the Sportsman's on Camelback quite a bit, so I'd been meaning to go to this one which I live much closer to. Finally made it the other night. Same great wine selection, same great light meals, especially their cheese selection (I LOVE cheese!), including a fantastic grilled cheese sandwich, knowledgeable staff, and even a free internet hotspot. The only problem? It's all hard surfaces, and the reverberation is TERRIBLE.  The sound of a party of 6 all moving their chairs to leave at the same time made me hold my ears & grit my teeth. It was exactly like the proverbial chalk on the blackboard.  I was in a group of people, and I could not hear the person 2 seats down from me, with all the voices were bouncing around it was one huge din. I really want to get back there soon, but not at a time when they will be busy. PS - I would really give this place a 4-1/2 if I could.

I wonder why there are no reviews already for this newish location of Tutti Santi. This is the 2nd in Scottsdale, the first being on Greenway at 63 St. THIS was the location of the former Ristorante Amarone, which I liked, although it was fairly expensive.  So I came in here by myself on a Tuesday night, when they were pretty busy. I asked the hostess if I could eat at the bar, which I could see a few other people doing and she said of course.  So I sat & made myself comfortable and waited for one of the 2 bartenders to give me the menu. And then I waited some more. They were not very busy. FINALLY, I had to wave the bartender over to ask for a menu (he first gave me the wine list - there are VERY FEW wines by the glass here, & nothing that sounded interesting).  I guess there were no specials, and no soup of the day listed, but after asking specifically, he told me of a soup (couldn't quite understand what it was except it had chicken).    I also was finally given some bread, which was standard supermarket tasteless Italian. No butter, so I used the olive oil at the counter, which was, I dunno, not quite right. Not rancid, exactly....not herbed, either.  I also ordered and received a Diet Coke which was pretty watery, with crushed ice.  Before I even went in, I'd had the urge for something like lasagna, baked manicotti, or ravioli, so I ordered the "Homemade Ravioli alla Nina" which I understand is one of their specialties.  Well, I was SORELY DISAPPOINTED by this dish, and I just cannot understand the rave reviews of it given by reviewers at their other locations.  Now, maybe I am too used to northeastern style Italian food (NYC/Boston) but also food in Chicago & San Francisco, and I'm used to not only the traditional, but also to many different restaurants serving "nouvelle" or innovative Italian dishes, including in Scottsdale.  So, here were my problems with this ravioli dish:  - the 'ultra thin' pasta shell tasted EXACTLY to me like the cellophane rice wrappers used for dim sum shrimp. Which is to say, not much taste really, but it works for dim sum. For ravioli? I dunno so much. This pasta was also translucent & white, like cellophane rice wrappers. Only mushier. There were I think 6 ravioli's. - the thin filling was finely chopped spinach & thin ricotta and not much of it. No seasoning that I could discern. - the sauce was a nearly tasteless cream sauce. - & each ravioli was topped by maaaybe a scant teaspoon of what seemed to be grainy unseasoned tomato stuff - almost like plain tomato paste?.  Not quite sure what to call it, but I sure wouldn't call it sauce. Yeah, like a dab of mild tomato paste.  The whole thing was just so tasteless that I had to SALT them to get any flavor whatsoever from the dish.  I've never in my life had to SALT Italian food!  The whole visual impression of the dish was FLAT. Like putting 6 Ritz crackers, each topped with a dab of cream cheese & a slice of pepperoni arranged on a large plate. Actually when they first brought it, I thought it was deviled eggs - all I saw was round white circles with a dab of red on each.  I managed to eat about half of this, then decided why should I waste my precious carbs? So I left the rest.   On the side there was a small green salad, not bad greens, but the dressing was watery as if they hadn't quite drained the greens enough. I can't quite say what type of salad dressing it was, it had little flavor. There was also a tasteless mealy Roma tomato in it. I only bothered to eat about 1/4 of it.  I decided I better cut my losses - surely the desserts wouldn't be any good, so I didn't bother.  The service was okay after the initial being ignored.  But the food was so mediocre that I would probably never go back. I looked around & tried to figure out if the clientele were to any degree Italian (American) but they just looked generic Scottsdale/Midwestern to me, so I dunno. I am very sure that my NYC & Boston Italian friends would be turning over in their graves, if they were dead.  *I* myself am not Italian, but I've eaten plenty of good Italian food in my life (some even in Scottsdale). But not here.

This is absolutely the BEST Spring Training facility I've been to here in AZ.  Thoughtfully designed - according to their materials, designed so that 85% of the seats get shade at some point during games, but there are also seats that get full sun 100% of the time, so you have your choice.  The lawn is lush and green - designed for families with kids, with tickets 1/2 the price of the actual seat stands, but there weren't many kids the day I was there.  They have dispensers of SPF 30 sunscreen right there for your use! No chairs allowed, just blankets, FYI.  Yes, the refreshments weren't cheap - but I don't think they were any more expensive than at any other Spring Training game I've been to. I don't know what the other reviewer was thinking - they expect a bottle of water for $1??? Geesh. I *think* you can bring one bottle of your own water in, but no other food or refreshments. They DO check your bags. The complainers will complain - after all, we ARE in Arizona, where people complain about just about everything.   There's a nice choice of food here, mostly by local businesses. They seem to have figured out how to direct traffic into the stadium and where to direct people to park - I live down the street and I was caught in traffic jams the first weekend before they resolved that issue.   Yes, the parking areas are dusty - you will have to keep your windows rolled up. We ARE in the desert, folks!  I see they have scheduled events other than Spring Training games here - a concert, a charity benefit...it's nice to see this gorgeous venue won't be wasted the other 11 months of the year!

After the bad reviews others have posted, I was really unsure what to expect. But I was VERY PLEASANTLY surprised!  The dough/crust is FANTASTIC - flavorful, and just the right crispness without being hard and burnt. It tastes like it might be almost-whole-grain. Not excessive, as in gritty, but just a bit chewy, in a good way.  I had a Fun Guy pizza (yeah, I know, lol) - LOTS of mushrooms - 5 different types - and lots of cheese. Brought home the leftover, and it was just as good reheated the next day.  The service wasn't bad for our large group of 8, although they did screw up the order a bit. We ordered TWO Fun Guy pizzas, but they only brought one. Not a big problem, we simply shared the first while waiting on the second.  The only weird thing is that many of the beers on the extensive beer list are served in CANS - I do NOT like canned beer. For example, all the New Belgium beers, like Fat Tire, which is one of my go-to beers.

AWFUL pizza, soggy with rock hard crust. Thin amount of cheese, wet veggies on top. Like frozen pizza!  The service was okay, though.

sadly, this Culver's has gone downhill. I think this is the second time in a row they've screwed up my order. This time, I asked for the toppings/condiments on the side, including tomatoes, so the burger wouldn't be so soggy. I SHOULD have looked in the bag before I left, but I didn't. So by the time I was at 92nd & Shea, when I looked in while stopped at the light, I saw  that they had NOT put in my condiments AT ALL. Also, I had a tough time explaining to the young man at the drive thru, what a "mocha" shake is. I know people out here don't drink coffee much, but it's fairly basic - mocha is either chocolate syrup with coffee ice cream, or coffee syrup with chocolate ice cream! Oh - and there were NO napkins in the bag, either.

Wow...I just went thru the drive thru, approx 9:30PM tonight, and ordered a "mocha shake". First the guy said "we can't do that". I said 'what? why not?". "Management has told us we CAN'T make them any more". "What?" "We're not ALLOWED to make them any more". I said, well I won't be doing business with you anymore, and drove on thru. WTF??? I know Midwesterners don't like coffee ice cream, and barely know what mocha IS, but this is ridiculous. You can't take some coffee ice cream (which you USED to have) and some chocolate syrup and MIX THEM??? I WILL NOT BE BACK.

Just had a wonderful experience at Henry's as part of a Meetup group. What a wonderful experience! We asked Henry to make up a "banquet" for us, and he certainly delivered.  My favorite dishes were the bean curd (cut in strips) with preserved egg, the cabbage (simple but so tasty!), and the eggplant - so garlicky, just the way I like it!. The egg drop soup is a classic, but a little different than how I've ever had it, and also very tasty. And yes, I tried the stinky tofu! It really doesn't smell that bad to me - maybe it's my sinuses - but I guess you could compare it to Limberger cheese. It has a sort of fried crust, with the soft bland tofu inside.   The service was excellent (although perhaps because Henry was personally supervising), and the atmosphere is bright and very clean, with gold-painted walls. It's a very small restaurant, so I wouldn't go on a weekend night, it must be a madhouse.  If I lived closer, this would become my "go-to" Chinese restaurant, but even with a nearly 45 minute drive away, I'm definitely coming back soon!

You go thru assembly line, cafeteria style, as they add the ingredients. It's a bit confusing if you're not familiar with the menu, and although they have a big sign showing everything when you first walk in, you can't see it to refer back to it while ordering. They DO have to-go menus at the check out, but that's at the END of the line - they should also have some at the beginning of the line. It's very noisy and there is a high glass partition between you and the employees, so it's a bit hard to hear if you ask questions.   They also have pre-bottled drinks AFTER the cash register, so that is a bit of jumping back-and-forth too, if you're not sure what they have available to drink. So the set-up logistics left a bit to be desired.   But the food itself was great! Everything was very fresh. I will definitely go back.  PS - bring a sweatshirt! It was REALLY cold in there, when I was there.
