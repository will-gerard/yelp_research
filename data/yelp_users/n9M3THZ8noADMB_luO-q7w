I have had this place repair a few items for me so I sent my daughter in to have 2 bracelets repaired.  He told her it would be $40 since she needed them in 2 days (she is leaving the country for 4 months).  She went back to pick them up and he told her that one bracelet would not be done until Monday.  Disappointed she took the one bracelet back and was told to come back at closing to get the other one.  She picked it up and was still charged $40 although he only fixed one bracelet not two.  The one he fixed all he had to do was remove some links!  Remove some links for $40????  What a rip off!!!  I wont be using him again nor do I recommend anyone using him.

Ok so after being put up by our insurance company at the Hyatt for a month due to a water leak and repairs, we decided to change to the Westin because it was much closer to our house and I could easily drive to meet contractors etc.  (Read my review regarding my experience at the Hyatt - this is worse).  Our insurance company made the two week reservation and paid for the room.  We checked in and everything was fine.  The next morning I see that I have been charged $1400 ($100 a day for incidentals) PLUS $3800 on my card.  I call my insurance company and they have assured me they paid for the room.  I go to the front desk with my insurance company on the phone and the girl at the desk says "well the insurance companies credit card didn't go through so we just charged yours"!!!!!!  Not even kidding this really happened.  Come to find out the girl had punched in the insurance companies credit card number wrong so she just took the liberty of charging mine.  It took several days talking to my bank to get my funds back.  Its a nice hotel but if you stay here other than for vacation be prepared for the large charge.

Our insurance company put us up while our house was under going repairs due to a leak. The insurance company booked the reservation and told us it was paid for.  When we checked in they told us they needed a credit card for incidentals.  No Problem.  I was charged $1400 ($100 for each day we were staying).  Ok.  We are locals so we didn't plan on eating at the expensive restaurants at the hotel but ok.  At the end of the two weeks our house still wasn't done so the insurance company extended our stay 2 more weeks.  The Hyatt charged me another $1400 although I had not even used but a small portion of the original $1400.  When I went to the front desk I was told to just call my bank and get it back.  I was also told "thats just how their system does it".  It took me several days to get the money back.  If you are staying here other than for vacation be prepared for the large charge.  I don't think its a good system.

The Kenny Rogers impersonator that works there is a complete JERK!  Worst treatment EVER!  I returned my truck FULL and I had the receipt from filling it up just moments before I returned it. When I got there he said "nope it's not full enough". I opened the cap and you could see how full it was. He still charged me $53 extra. I am disputing this charge and I am also filing a complaint against this guy. He was so RUDE. DO NOT EVER RENT A PENSKE TRUCK!!!  You are an A-hole!  Merry Christmas you idiot!!!!

My new favorite place in Wickenburg!  We used to always go to Anita's but when I called and they would not set up a table for our large party of 12 we tried El Ranchero.  El Ranchero was so accommodating and had the table ready to go.  They immediately brought out salsa and bean dip.  The chips are to die for!!!  Best chips since Mexico.  The service was great!  We are so happy we tried this place.  We plan on eating here every time we go thru Wickenburg.  I highly recommend you try this place.

I ordered a cake for a 10am delivery to our neighbor. They call me at 10:30 to say no one is home. I said "you were supposed to deliver at 10". They tell me if I want it redelivered that I have to pay another $15!  Like these cakes aren't expensive enough right?  This place is a total rip off and worst customer service EVER!  They could have at least made one more attempt to deliver!!!  I had to go pick up the cake and deliver it myself. WOW what a great surprise for my neighbor duh!  Plus there is a super funky sewer smell in the store. It really grossed me out. I won't be ordering from them ever again.

Way over priced at $17 for a a steak the size of a plum. So tough I couldn't cut it. Service wasn't bad but the food is not that great. I wouldn't go back. Waitress mumbled when I asked for two checks. Even happy hour prices were high for the quality and portion size. I used to love the one in Oklahoma but no longer a fan.

We went through Lowes for carpet and Cesar's installed it. We were very happy with their work. The guys worked all day and never stopped!  They thought it would be 3-4 hours but was over 8. They had to replace all of the tack strips. From measuring to install to follow up this company is great!  We like them so much we are having them replace all of the tile in our house.

I have been doing SottoPelle for 4 years.  In started them while I was in Oklahoma and I'm so happy to have found a doctor that does them in Scottsdale too.  For me, they are life changing.  My skin and hair look great!  I feel great!  My mood is great!  Workouts are better and any aches and pains I had are gone.  Don't just do it one time.  Do it for a year and you will really notice the difference.  Now I go every 5 months instead of every 3.  Its so worth it!  I highly recommend all of the doctors there.

Many of you have been sending me private messages regarding the pellets.  I feel that I must give you an update and let you know what symptoms I have been having.  After my 2nd insertion, I noticed that my hair was thinning on the temples (like male pattern baldness).  I called and told the office and they told me to come pick up a bottle of their "Hair Repair" formula.  I started taking it and noticed how unbelievably thirsty I was 24 hours a day.  At my 3rd insertion I told the nurse and the doctor how concerned I was about my hair loss.  The doctor told me to take 2 "Hair Repair" formula pills per day.  I started having mild leg cramps despite drinking about a gallon of water per day.  I called the office again and told them that I am REALLY concerned about my hair loss and they called me in a perscription of "Seralactone" which is a DHT blocker.  After a few days on this medicine, I had such severe leg cramps that I could not sleep or walk.  My electrolytes were so out of whack with the excessive water.  Dr. Tutura knew about the hair loss in women and thats why he created the "Hair Repair" formula that they sell.  It does not repair the hair but it is to block the DHT that causes hair loss.  On my very first insertion, the doctor did not say anything about hair loss in women who get the pellets.  In fact, he told me the opposite.  He said "you might notice extra facial hair".  Yes I noticed extra facial hair which I can deal with but what I cannot deal with is the amount of hair loss that I have had.  No one said anything to me about hair loss.  In a society where hair is very important to women, you think they would mention that!  Now my friend Paula who is on the pellets loves the thinning hair.  She has enough hair for 4 women, so of course she loves having thinner more manageable hair.  I cancelled my 4th insertion and the doctor called and said "well, I guess your body is just sensitive to the testosterone."  Then he proceeded to tell me to go to the dermatologist because maybe something else was going on for the hair loss.  So I did and guess what the dermatologist told me "women are not mean't to have high doses of testosterone.  He gave me some sites to research where 1,000's of women who have had the pellets have all had the same hair loss.  Do the pellets make you feel better?  Yes they do.  Is it worth the Hair Loss?  NO IT IS NOT.  I do not want to wear a wig just so I can have better sex and feel better.  I want all women to make an educated decision before getting the pellets.  I am hoping that the hair will grow back once the pellets have worn off.  If the follicles are completely dead and the hair doesn't grow back then I will be wearing bangs for the rest of my life with a 3" receding hairline on both temples!  I just wish the doctor and his office was as concerned about the hair loss as I was over 9 months ago.  Maybe this could have been prevented.

We love the product and we love Ron!  We now know that the person we had issues with has been let go.  Thank goodness because Ron deserves to be 5 stars with his amazing finishes and he personally came out and gave us our bid.  I got a phone call from the office regarding my previous review and I really appreciate being heard and taking the time out to contact me.  Now this is great customer service.  I would definitely recommend Designer Cabinet Refinishing to my friends and family.  Thanks Ron for reaching out.

LOVE this place. Best pizza you can get. Crust is not too thick. Reminds me of NY!  House chianti is a good price. Fun to go before the movies. My daughter took us for the first time in Nevada. Glad there is one here.

We have been using Stan for two years now. He has done everything from putting up new ceiling fans and light fixtures to installing new toilets and faucets to building our storage shed and gazebo to demolition and painting to landscape lighting. There just isn't anything Stan can't do!!!  His prices are fair and he is an honest person. I highly recommend him.

Where is the 6th star button?  This company truly deserves to be a 6 star review. Sean did our neighbors house and we watched him for several days meticulously sculpt our neighbors front yard into perfection. Moon Valley had done Phase I but when it was time to do Phase II we knew Sean was the one. His price is at least 30% lower then anyone. First of all, he and his crew showed up on the day they said they would. That's the 1st star!  Sean has great ideas on the design. That's the 2nd star! They finished right on time. That's the 3rd star!  His crew is pleasant and nice. That's the 4th star!  His price is THE best by far. That's the 5th star!  Sean turned our backyard into the resort we always wanted. That's the 6th star!  Thank you Sean!  We will refer you to everyone. We are so excited for Phase III when we build the guest house and finish our two acre masterpiece!  Do not be fooled by any other landscaping company. This is the real deal. Check out the photos!

We have done 3 projects with Rob now. He has the best prices of anyone!  He is honest and checked on our job every day. His crews are great too!  If you need an RV gate or block wall Rob is the best!  I highly recommend him.

I have been searching for the right place for months since we moved. This place is it!  Affordable, clean, friendly. The owners Rock!  Both work 7 days a week!  Amazing!  You must try the natural nails!  Never thought I'd give up acrylics until now. It's just as strong but good for your nails. Thank you guys for everything. I highly recommend this place.
