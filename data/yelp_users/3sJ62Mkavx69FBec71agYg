Not good. The patio is top notch for relaxing if the weather's good but I couldn't shake that chain feeling when inside. Table and chairs had a slightly sticky feeling to them (nice, eh?). Food was typical pre-cooked, oven heated dollop of too much grease and cheese. Not impressed. It's a shame cause the garden and even the nachos & salsa had me expecting big things.

Well I suppose I am kinda biased as I teach at YP. But it wasn't always that way. I used to practice at other studios around town and had always enjoyed classes. I metEric, the owner, through a business meeting and we got talking. He invited me to practice and I haven't looked back. Since then I completed the 500 hour certification program and the studio is part of my life.   If you are looking for something different, go to Pura. The classes still give you the physical work out but what's different is that you get the philosophy too. Not just a few new age words sprinkled in here and there but a truly holistic understanding of this ancient practice.  Try it once. You never know. You might like it.

Well I am probably going to be pretty unpopular with this review but sometimes you just got to have your say. I find it astonishing that most people criticize places like this because it is not "authentic". I understand what they mean but please. This is Phoenix Arizona. Not Bangkok or Chang  Mai, Thailand. And I'll be honest. I've been fortunate enough to spend time in Thailand and the food really didn't appeal to me as much. Same with Indian food. The Indian food in London is stellar. A really special blend of different regional fares. In India? It seemed pretty ordinary.  So yes, I am making a crazy statement. That possibly the most "authentic" food might not actually be the most interesting.  With that ridiculous statement made, I love this place. Yes, I agree the place runs with the efficiency of a zoo sometimes. And sometimes the wait staff need a good kick up the arse. But for the most part, the food is excellent. Tasty and satisfying. Every now and then a dish comes out ill prepared. But I've had that experience in many places, bar the expensive ones.  So forget trying to frame the place against "the real deal" and enjoy it for what it is!

Couldn't agree more with the majority of reviews. It's not good.  I had gone to Best Buy to buy a new fridge. Thirty minutes later I am standing in the hi-fi section persuading myself that what I really need is a kick ass stereo.  I decide to step outside to try and calm what could be an awful frenzy of spending. Pick Up Stix looks like a great place to grab a quick bite so I stop by.   Like so much fast food, it sounds good. Seems convenient. But of course you leave regretting your actions almost immediately. Still, it worked.   I have a new fridge.

Being Indian, and having grown up in London, I have been pretty spoilt for Indian food. Imagine my dismay when I moved to Phoenix! I've tried many different places here in town desperately trying to recapture the memory of a good London curry house but each time I've left either disappointed or clutching my guts fearing what may come.  Couple of friends introduced me to this place a few months ago and I'm stoked. It's not as good as the stuff back home. And I'm sure you can get better in San Francisco or New York. But if you are looking for something closer to home you can't go wrong.  Plus its got the real live Indians eating in there too. Can't be bad!!

I'm with Tracy. I really like this place. The layout is clean and simple. The atmosphere super chilled. The food fresh and tasty. Whenever I have business meetings at lunch, I bring people to independent downtown eateries. I feel its my duty to show them that our city is starting to bloom. And everyone I have brought dug the food and the vibe.  But the most important thing? The owner, Dwayne, is super friendly, keen to hear feedback, and eager to make his new restaurant work.   That's a whole kind of refreshing in itself.

I went last week for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. Food wasn't bad, ambiance was great (very European) and the big guy behind the counter started belting out opera as we stood waiting for our order to be filled. And yes, the gelato is very good.  So why not 5 stars? Well here's the thing. I may be harsh but places like this are a dime a dozen in big cities from London to Rome, New York to Paris. Compared to them? its OK. Compared to the relatively meager options in Phoenix, it's pretty damned good.  So, like everything else, it just depends on your yardstick. Either way, stop by. Its different and we should do all we can to support people trying to give this town some soul.
