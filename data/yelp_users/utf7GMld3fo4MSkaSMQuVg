I hadn't been to this salon in years and decided to give it a try after being unsatisfied with my last tech, who I have no intent to go back to because Hiedj at Mirage did an amazing job on my nails!  My old acrylic was old and brittle so she took them off, gave me a new set and gave me exactly the look I asked for! I could not get that at the last place I went so I am very please! I've been on hikes with these nail and other outdoor activities and they still look brand new! It's been about two weeks now ice had them done!

I absolutely love this dentist office and the staff! All very nice people and the dentist is very sweet too! I needed a root canal that was caused by my last dentist putting a terrible cap on my tooth. It hadn't been long enough for my insurance to pay for another one so the dentist offered to pay for my cap him self if he couldn't make it work otherwise! After my first appointment, they couldn't get deep enough into my roots and I needed to see a specialist. They covered my specialist bill too! I have not had any issues since my work was done and I am very happy. I will be taking my whole family here now!

I was super excited this popped up in my area! They have the best shaved ice in town! This place is great, stocked with board games, crayons and color books for your convenience, clean lobby and clean working areas where they make everything. Just a nice place to grab a  treat with someone.

We love trying new places but I guess all of them can't be good. Food was mediocre, could have make a better BLT at home. My husband tried to say he liked his food but he didn't even touch the caramelized apples that came on his French toast, which isn't like him. Kids got pancakes, can't go wrong with those. Also, super bummed I couldn't get a mimosa at brunch because they don't serve alcohol. Boo hoo.

Seriously such a great hidden gem! I never noticed this in downtown Chandler before and found it on Yelp. We took the family and it was delicious. You get to create your own ice cream sandwich which was really fun! The cookies are awesome, almost all the ice cream is gluten free and very tasty! We will make this a regular stop for a cold treat!
