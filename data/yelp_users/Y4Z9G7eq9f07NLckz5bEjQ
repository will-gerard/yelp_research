This little place is really cool if you need to study, meet with friends and/or need a quick bite! It always pack. I think they are a bit expansive and this is why I gave them four instead of five stars...but you should absolutely visit and decide for yourself. I absolutely recommend it!

I had brunch today with my mother and we had a great experience! The food, the service and the pricing are excellent. I am NOT a fan of chain restaurant and I never recommend them...this restaurant is my exception! Lunch! Awesome! Bring your friend and enjoy a beer or cocktail before heading back to work!

Great location, amazing customer service! ...unfortunately the food is below average and tasteless! I love Paradise Bakery and hoped to find something similar in the area...I was very disappointed.

I absolutely love this place! The ambiance, the crowd and the FOOD. Their thin crust fungi pizza with beets salad is my favorite!  The wine selection is just ok. They could definitely do just a bit better. Overall including pricing, I love this place.

If I could I would give this company NO STARS. They have delivered my package at a different location. They are claiming that the package was delivered to my house. Now, I have to fight to get my return back. I have called them three times and the driver does not have the decency to even come back and fix his mistake. Worst company ever. DO NOT SHIP WITH THEM. Use good old FedEx and UPS.

I have been going to Top Notch for about six months and been loving it. Tiffany, is my favorite girl ever! She is super creative, talented, hard working and kind :)   If you want a crazy design Tiffany is the girl to see. She is an artist! Promise you won't regret it!   If she is not available you can try any of the other girls...They are all very good and careful with people especially concerned about their sensitive skin.   The place is clean, modern, with a relaxing atmosphere.   Relax and enjoy! I always do!!
