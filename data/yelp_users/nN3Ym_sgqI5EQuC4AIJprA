With 4 stars on yep I was hoping for a tasty breakfast but after a long wait I got a plate of overcooked eggs, weird tasting greasy bacon, completely undercooked potatoes (how hard is it to cook taters until they are brown?) and the toast they served tasted just like the greasy grill, terrible. It was all really inedible as was the Menudo that my girlfriend ordered. Disgusting. Also people are in there at 10am drinking large beers, very weird place. Is it a restaurant, store, bar? Not sure.. I am sure it sucks though and I will never go back.

I wish I could do negative stars. They are crooks! And liars! They will rape you any chance they can get and their customer service is a complete joke. Their website has incorrect information posted and everything I have ever tried to do with BofA has been a night mare. I wouldn't wish this bank on my worst enemy!

On time, friendly, honest and they did what they said. My roof came with a 10 year warranty and this company will be around to back that based on what I have heard and read about them. I feel good about my experience with Lyons. I even had the President of the company come out which made me feel extra secure in my decision to use them.

I love samurai sams and the service from Nacho (the cook) over the years has been great. He is always super friendly and makes the t-bowl just how I like it. I like the white meat chicken bowl with no veggies and brown rice. Comes out to 450 calories a perfect lunch. You can also grab a bottle of the sauce for 5$. My only suggestions for this location would be to have more reading material for the lunch crowd and to give out free side sauces rather than charge 25 cents. Sam Sams is a favorite for a healthy tasty lunch!

One of the best sports bars in the valley. Ton's of screens (although some of the big screen projectors could be updated). Nice big drafts and the food is always tasty. Try the teriyaki chicken sandwich with fries it's awesome. Upstairs they have shuffleboard and pool tables. Golden tee 2009 downstairs with another pool table. If you like loud sports bars where the patrons get into the game this is the spot to go. Plenty of fun to be had. People say too many kids but I guess I go later on at night and never have seen a problem with little kids.?. The service is on and off here, sometimes it's been great sometimes it's been useless.

The place was packed, un-rangered and the course was in terrible shape. 5 hour round with slow greens and old boring layouts on both Palm and Pine courses. The price was nothing special and I injured my wrist there so f it. There are definitely much better choices for the money in Scottsdale. Also the course was full of wanabe's that look like they go to the PGA tour store and fashion themselves after Ian Poulter. BRING YOUR OWN WATER as they only have a few fountains on the course and the water that comes out of them is an un-drinkable 100 degrees. How can they not put out iced water coolers in AZ?

I posted a quick tip while I was there today but for some reason that doesn't show up on the Yelp website. WTF? Any how.. I kindly asked the bartender if she could put the golf on the TV today.. seeing as how we were the only people at the bar I figured this would not be an issue. It turns out all TV's in the entire restaurant are controlled by 1 DirectTV box and it was "first come first served" when it came to the channel that was on. She asked her fellow employees if anyone was watching the basketball game and 3 waiters responded "yes". It turns out it was the wait staff that was watching the game rather than catering to their customers and she said she couldn't change it. This is not the first time I have had HORRIBLE customer service at this place. It's a shame too because I like their crappy Mexican food and home brewed beer but with attitudes like that it's no wonder they have only 2 1/2 stars. How do you turn away customers and money just because the lazy ass wait staff wants to watch basketball? Never ever will go there again. P.S. Why does the logo show a chili that's farting? Might want to hire a real graphic designer like myself next time.

I used to play this course (the north and south courses as they used to be called) back in my high school golf days every day after school. The course layout has changed a bit for those 9's but all in all it's the same old place. I remember it used to be in better condition however. I really don't think the layouts of the 3 9's are very good. The East course (across the street) is probably the most interesting of them all and is the newest. Beware, they don't have a driving range so you might want to warm up down the street at cracker jacks or something. I wouldn't recommend this place really unless they have some 10$ deals on. If you can keep the ball straight you will do fine here.

Always consistent, great and healthy Mexican food! Same cook since I can remember. I can grab a chicken fajita bowl with chicken, rice, pinto beans and a tortilla and it all comes in under 500 calories with about 5 grams of fat. Extremely tasty and I enjoy the spicy and rojo salsas. I never have to wait long for my meal and always enjoy a house margarita for $2.99. They also have a Blue Burrito card that you can get stamped each time and on your 10th visit you get $5 off. If you want some healthy options I would recommend BBQ over Chipotle. I respect a place that shows the calories and fat in their dishes and gives people options to enjoy good food that is healthier than the usual lard loaded, calorie disguised foods.   I only wish they offered baked tortilla chips similar to what Top Shelf does.

Always enjoy the Teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice and no veggies. So much so that it is all I ever order there. However, my girl has tried every other dish there and been very please with 99% of them. They have good tasting water, nice napkins and tasty fortune cookies. Good service most of the time and very reasonable prices.  My only complain would be that on their website they showed the Teriyaki bowl to be only 500 calories but they actually split the bowl up into 2 servings which makes it 1000 calories so you must read the fine print before calculating your caloric intake.  I can't wait to go back and get another t-bowl!

Try the Inebriator beer it is amazing! And the Inebriator Tootsie Roll is out of this world. $2 micro brews at happy hour and they are super tasty!  Don't know about the steaks and stuff but the place is your usual old western theme with shit stapled all over the place and ties hanging from the ceiling. If you want some tasty beers with high alcohol content give those two a try though.

Dr. Mike is amazing. One of my cats had stomatitis and his immune system was eating away at his teeth and he was in extreme pain. I had some tough decisions to make but Dr. Mike helped me through this and always took time to explain everything in detail to me. I made the decision to have all of my cats his teeth removed, which was a scary one but now a few weeks later my kitty is 100% happy and acting like nothing happened.  Dr. Mike always personally called to check up on my kitty and really showed that he cares. No more pain or bad breath and I am very happy I had Dr. Mike take care of this. I fully trust him and am happy that I found a vet that knows what they are doing.

Friendly staff and always consistent chicken bowls. A great part about this store is they give you bottles of spicy and regular teriyaki sauce to add to your bowls. Some stores charge 25 cents for an extra little container of sauce. This one also has a TV which I like to watch while inhaling the brown rice no veggie white chicken bowls. :) Yum! Keep up the great work Sammy Sam.

I like the layout and atmosphere at this Dos Gringos. The had good prices on drinks and I thought their street tacos were really good. The crowd seems pretty chill and if it's too hot outside you can go inside like a wuss. I liked the Dos trailer park that used to be in Tempe as well but this one is better.

Got a hole in one on #12  and shot 3 under par last week. Continental is always fun and always in pretty good shape for a course that gets so much play. Greens hold nicely and put pretty true. I will be back of course. I wish there were more course like it around, great short  game practice and driveable par 4's.

Went to try the happy hour and was pretty impressed. $5 martinis (perfect full pours) and really good margaritas. The Big Ass burger for $10 was very tasty. I had to box it up even, such a huge portion. The green chile pork dish was very tasty as well. Good service, nice bar area and good schedule on the happy hour. Every day from 4-7, Sun and Mon 4-close I think. I will be going back here for sure at some point.

I used to go here quite a bit but found the owner to be not so friendly even though I was a repeat customer. The teriyaki bowl is ok but nothing to write home about and I am a teriyaki bowl specialist. I also didn't like how they closed from 4-5 which to me is a bit retarded to me. Maybe they have changed their hours but I don't go back.

Cox is pitiful. After the 3rd receiver broke and I went back down to get another one they actually blamed it's failure on me. I think their equipment is absolute garbage and they will not give you a new unit but only beat up, used, refurbished crap that breaks. Also, the user interface for the box is slow and always freezes. Try Dish Network or DirecTV.  P.S. You should see what the installation guy did to my house! I had to have them send another guy to come and fix the walls and redo all of the wiring lol. Good luck!

Put anything longer than a 5 iron away off the back tees. Once you wrap your head around this you might enjoy this layout. If you like target golf it doesn't get any more targety than this. It's one thing to have a really short and tight golf layout but the blind holes are ridiculous. Half my shots were to something I couldn't see. If you don't have local knowledge here or have played it a few times before good luck!  Nice views though! :)

There is not much to do in Cave Creek. I consider Harrold's to be a great place to go for a little break. They have a great happy hour from 4-6 with 1$ small drafts and appetizers (2 tacos, 2 sliders, 2 beef ribs, 6 wings or a cheese crisp) 2$ domestic bottles and 3$ large drafts. Always good service by friendly staff. The food is pretty tasty and they usually have some evening live entertainment going on. Not to mention off the track betting for gamblers.

Both times I have been in here the employees have guided me to overpriced shipping methods and un needed packaging. Just yesterday I went in with an old mobile phone I wanted to send to a friend and when I asked what is the cheapest method to send this he instructed me that 18$ was the best he could do. Thankfully another customer mentioned I could send it for under $5 using USPS. Why did the UPS employee not let me know about this option? I switched to the $5 USPS method which saved me $13 and the package will arrive at the same time. I will not give this place any more of my business.

Durant's is everything a steakhouse should be. Dimly lit with a somewhat mafia like gangstery feeling warm atmosphere, professional and prompt no b.s. service with THE BEST tasting 12 oz filet I have ever had. The walk through the kitchen is a nice touch, especially when leaving because you get a chance to thank the chefs that made that mouthwatering slab of perfection you just gorged on. I don't mind paying a bit more for a meal like I had last night. And they don't skimp on the pours, my martini was filled to the brim which is just how it should be. Mastros can take their pretentious wait staff and long speeches about how their cows are hand fed grass by some old farmer and his wife in ohio and seasoned with blah blah blah, seared in a 1200 degree oven and served with bleh blipitty bloop and if I order it rare it will have a cool pink center etc (I think I know what rare is)... just give me the GD steak and make it amazing like Durant's did and let me enjoy my company and my meal. I can't wait to go back!  P.S. Their Bearnaise sauce was great too.

I have eaten here before and the food is tasty but today when I went in for happy hour at the bar I was shocked at the lack of professionalism displayed by the staff. They were all talking very loud and swearing while showing each other images on their phones. Not only that but the bartender girl was constantly texting on her phone rather than paying attention to her customers. I am pretty sure the manager was there and actually joined in on the locker room type of talk with his employees which was a shame. I couldn't even talk to my girlfriend because they were so loud and distracting. They also were making fun of their customers and their drink choices. All in all I would not go back here after what I saw. How does a place like this that acts like it is upper crust have a staff of unprofessional people up front? As a manager, how do you not have some rule in place that bans phones from employees while they are working? This was amateur hour and definitely not what I expected. Maybe at Olive Garden but even they have rules and their employees don't pick up their phone at any chance they get.  The flatbread was tasty. I wish I could have enjoyed it instead of listening to a flamboyant server talk about how drunk he got he night before.

I expected a dump based on what it looks like out front but the manager was very nice and they only played 2 mins of previews which was awesome. Inside, the theater was kept up and clean and they also validate parking which most places don't do around there. I had a good time yesterday watching "God Bless America". I like the feel of a small theater instead of the usual multiplex. Also, there a many bars around it so you can grab a few cold ones before the flick.

I never thought much of this place from the outside but the inside is really well done. I will keep this short and simple.. their happy hour is great and you MUST try the ribs. You get a half rack (which was a huge half rack) and fries for $6.99. The meat falls off the bone and it is tender and juicy with a sauce that is incredible. I also enjoyed the $6 martini.  You can get 20 oz beers for $4 as well. I will be going back to try a  full meal next time.

This review is based on their mini-golf and that alone. Everything else looked pretty useless as well but the mini-golf was an absolute joke. They had 3 courses to choose from and all three were very poorly designed and run down like the place has been around for 20+ years. If you want a real mini-golf experience I suggest going to Castles and Coasters.

I decided to go in after I saw a "lunch specials" sign out front by the road. The menu said nothing about lunch specials and when I asked the waiter/manager what the lunch specials were he said "ahh well whatever you order I will be sure to make it extra special". I ordered a chicken gyro which was $8 on the menu (overpriced to begin with). The gyro came out and there was nothing special about it. It tasted ok but was not made with a fresh pita. When the bill came it had nothing special done to it, it was still 8$. I had to ask where my lunch special was and the waiter took the bill back and went to his terminal and printed out another bill with 10% off. Wow, some special. Nothing like getting lied to to make someone feel special. I will not go back to this restaurant based on the misleading false advertising and the lie that I would get something special. Don't waste your time or money on a place like this.

Flo's lunch deal is good bargain. The dishes are usually around 7$ and come with a salad with a tasty dressing and bowl of won tons with a nice orange dipping sauce. I usually order the Teriyaki bowl and they now have the option of white or brown rice. It is enough food that I can only eat half of it and bring the rest home for dinner. I enjoy the ultra quick water refills as well. You can't beat the lunch deal I recommend it highly! Only complaint is that it can get a bit noisy when it's packed and it's usually packed!

One of my favorite places to grab a thick juicy steak and martini. All the dishes I have had there have been great and the drinks are stiff. I also love the fact that the place is so dark the waiters have to use a flashlight to help you look at the menu. Careful!! Those plates are sizzling hot!! MMmmastros. I will be back again soon!

The location is nice, nice new building, clean, had the makings of a nice BBQ joint but a 30 minute wait for a pulled pork sandwich? Really?   A bun that was burnt around the edges and soggy in the middle. The sandwich was pretty tasteless even with their watery sauces added. The meat tasted like it had been boiled and was extremely watery as well. Fries are nothing special either. Makes me wonder, did Bryan's just do an extra good job at promotions and public relations to get these magazine reviews and plaques on walls? Now, I haven't tried their other selections, which are supposed to be very tasty but I am not sure I will give it another shot if they can't pull off a simple pulled pork sandwhich.  I miss Tony Romas!  P.S. I'm not a jerk, just straight shootin' ;)  P.S.S. I just upgraded it from a 1 star to 2 star for their large portions. I was stuffed.

I think their patio is great, excellent people watching. It's always full of scottsdale cougars, makes me feel like I am on one of those Real Housewives shows. The happy hour is a great deal. 1/2 off drinks, 1/2 off appetizers. The martinis are very tasty and always come with the shaker so you get a full drink and not a short pour. I wish City North wasn't so abandoned because it looked like it could have been a nice street. I will go back many more times. P.S. Don't forget to check in through yelp on your first visit for a free drink (which could be about 15$ worth if you order it right).

Decided to order a pizza from Uncle Louie since it's pretty close to my house and I am always looking for new places. I ordered an extra large pepperoni pizza for 21$ (which is extremely pricey) and went in to pick it up. What I got was barely a large, about 15 inches. It was overly oily, to the point where I had to use a paper towel to suck up the grease on top first before trying to eat it. It was overly salty yet somehow had no taste and the crust was soggy. I wasn't sure if I was looking at a regular pizza or a thin crust, it's like they couldn't make their mind up when they made it. I have eaten better pizza from a circle K. I was very disappointed in not only the price and the size but the taste and quality as well. Will not be going inside to try anything else they make.

You can't go wrong doing anything at Desert Mountain. The Cochise/Geronimo clubhouse is spectacular with a view of the entire valley that is un-matched. Give the Chiracuaha golf course a try you won't find a better layout in the state.

I was saddened to find that the Dos Gringos trailer park was gone, not that it was anything special but it was a Tempe staple. Barneys seemed like it was thrown together in a day as far as decor goes. None of the tables or chairs match, the signs are painted by what looks like a 4th grade class and the main attraction is a spin wheel that too looks like it was found in a junkyard. The food wasn't very good, in fact my girl found an eyelash in her fish tacos which were deep fried and mostly tasteless. I ordered the sliders for some reason and they were about as thin as a sheet of paper and had even less taste. We got a few buckets of Coors for 10$ each which was acceptable. I wouldn't make a point to stop here again. The service seemed to be ok. Oh yeah, parking is in back where the trailer park used to be just fyi.

Went with a few friends the other night and had a great time. I thought the crowd was a bit douchey but hey, this is the Scottsdale Quarter. We cramped into seats at the bar with some weird dance music playing which is strange for an Italian restaurant but again, they are catering to the Quarter crowd. I ordered a martini with no olives, confirmed that the bartender heard me say no olives yet somehow had 3 olives taking up room and polluting the taste of my vodka. Not only that but the pour was extremely low, were talking about half way, and I had 4 martinis throughout the course of the evening and they all were half pours which sucks at $10 a pop. A real pour goes right to the brim. I had the Chicken Milanese which was extremely tasty, I would definitely order it again. The red sauce was awesome and the pasta tasted like it was freshly made. Their spin/art dip was very good as well. Everyone at the table fully enjoyed their dishes and the waiter, although seemed new to the game, did a great job. I would go here again and after seeing their happy hour specials will definitely add it to my list. I will try their filet next  time since my buddy swears by them.

Very satisfied with this safeway. Always very friendly, helpful staff and I can always find what I am looking for. They also have a gas station out front and since I shop at safeway quite a bit I end up saving 10 cents per gallon when I fill up using the safeway card. I recommend shopping at this one, it's also right by Pei Wei so I enjoy grabbing a chicken bowl during the same visit :)

One of the cleanest hotels I have ever been to. The inside decor is very well done  and I was impressed at home un-smokey it was. The room was really nice, with all new equipment and very comfortable bed. I was at a lounge during happy hour and they had $3 martinis (1/2 off drinks). What a deal! Ling and Louis (an asian fusion type of restaurant) was extremely quick and very reasonably priced and tasty. I was going to try Schulas Steakhouse but I read some bad reviews and decided to stay away from it. I would stay there again, it was a great deal.

Horrible customer service every time I go in there. Last time there were 4 employees standing near the front entrance inside just talking to each other. They clearly saw I was looking at some water fountains that were stacked in the aisle and never once asked me if I needed help. I did need help because there was no pricing on any of the items and when I asked one of them for pricing I got an attitude and a "I am not sure, I can go check if you would like?". WTF? Yes I would like you to check on pricing, that's why I asked. When the guy finally comes back he tells me the price then walks away. He made no effort to put price tags on any of the items so I am sure there was more customers that had no idea how much the fountains cost.   The time before I was forced to make a purchase on my phone through their website because the refused to match their own website price with a product that was in the store. All in all, Lowes sucks, I am heading to Home Depot right down the street from now on.

I like the fact the entire process of getting an appointment and filling out paperwork was done online. They got me in the waiting room right on time and were friendly. Although I had to wait a little time to see Dr. Mike he was very nice as was his assistant and hopefully I am on the way to clearing up the problem.

Recently opened and they did a great job with the inside and out. Dining inside with 2 bars outside, one downstairs with fireplace and one upstairs with views. Heaters are all over so it's warm and comfortable. The balcony up top had a nice bar and when I went there, a live band. Happy hour M-F 4-7 I think? Prices are reasonable. I had a green chili burger and it was very tasty and the waitress was very nice.  All of the staff is courteous and I plan on going back for more good times.

Stayed there last night and had a great time. The room was extremely nice, I am jealous that it's not how my room at home is. Very new, clean and comfortable. Amazing bathroom with waterfall shower. The lighting in the room was great too. I had a nice view of the pool and the south course behind. My only complaint is I had no idea how to call the front desk with the nice new phone system they had. Also, what ever happened to bathroom doors that actually shut so there is a little privacy? This sliding doors don't make any sort of a seal and don't give much privacy.  I love how the pool and hot tub area is open 24/7 and they give you complimentary water rather than the usual $5 bottles at most places. Nice little touches.  I look forward to going back some time soon. The cigar lounge downstairs is fun. Orange Sky, the restaurant upstairs is very good. I never win at gambling so I won't comment on the tight slot machines ;)

Played in the 110 degree heat but still had a fun round. I was impressed with the layout of this course compared to the other ones at tonto verdo across the street. This layout seemed modern and fun rather than tight and targety. It was in decent shape for mid summer but I would like to play it in winter shape. It looks like they were trying to get houses built around the course but so far there are only a few. No clubhouse or anything but that didn't bother me. As long as they supplied the group with water and ice I was happy. The starter was very friendly. Views of the valley and 4 peaks was excellent. For $25 it was a good deal.  I agree with Shawn S. Generous fairways and actual sand in bunkers!

I think this is a great location but I am not impressed with the food or drink. I ordered some bbq sliders and I they tasted exactly like lloyds bbq in a bucket from Safeway. Not a great deal and their beer selection is tiny. This place could be something special but sadly I will pass on going here again. It's a shame because they have a nice patio out front and the interior is nice as well.

Although it's extremely loud the place is really cool and has tasty food and drinks. I really like the decor and the feel of the inside and the marketing. They have happy hour from 3-7 every day with $2 tacos and 3$ Dos XX as well as $5 specialty margaritas. Tons of TV's and a nice patio in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. The bartender was great and very quick. All of the tacos I tried were very good. I will go back and try more items again. P.S. LOVE the fake mustaches they provide free of charge. Mucho funo.

As I had to cover the Jodi Arias trial for the last 4 months I got very accustomed to walking to the kilt for a lunch time beer and some food occasionally. I like the layout and half in half out bar they have with a nice view of the ball park. Every waitress I had was very friendly and always did a good job. I liked their kilt burger so much I never ordered any other item but everyone that I ate with had good things to say about their dishes. They have a beer of the month special and good happy hour. I really like their TK lager beer, very tasty!

Always looking for a good burger so decided to give this place a shot during happy hour. It was very busy with many families and small children there. It's a local Grayhawk hangout, nice little joint with many beers and TV's all over the place. I ordered some new burger they had called the French Onion for $13 (a little pricey IMHO). I think I misread the description because I was somehow thinking I was getting a french onion soup type of dipping bowl or something. It was a big burger with an onion ring on it and some french dip sauce. Although it was different than what I had envisioned it was still very tasty and the fries were pretty good too. Huge portions. They had 16 oz beers in cool grenade style mugs for $3. Many other beers to chose from. We had good service and even though it was packed the food came out in a timely manner. My girl had the hot dog and she said it was "pretty good".  I would go here again, I will try the shake next time with my burger.

Other than the fact I booked a single king and got two doubles instead the place is nicely redone. The rooms were very comfortable and the location can't be beat. Walking distance to everything in old town scottsdale. Plus a free continental breakfast? Great deal. I will be back here again since all of the other hotels around are usually $200 or more. (Hilton Garden Inn is usually the cheapest of the higher up brands and it's right across Scottsdale Road).

Not impressed at all. Didn't even get a chance to eat because I waited for 6 minutes without being acknowledged by a server. The hostess asks me if I would like a booth or a table, I say booth and she sighs and acts like the world is ending. This place looks like your typical over priced Scottsdale joint with bimbos as waitresses who can't crack a smile. By the way, when did apple juice become as expensive as grey goose? $5 for a glass of juice? Seriously? I could buy two huge jugs of apple juice at costco for $5. I am glad they waitresses didn't serve me, f this place.

I am very pleased with Hacienda's, especially for a restaurant that just opened about a month ago. The interior is very new and clean and the bar in the middle is very nice. They also have another bar at the front that can serve the patio which wraps around the front. The chips are good, especially the little green ones and their salsa is very tasty. They even made an extra hot sauce for me.  The bar staff is excellent and very knowledgeable. They have a great happy hour with $2.50 drafts and $5 appetizers (love the street tacos).  M-Sat 3-6. The margarita tasted fresh and like a marg should.  Dining there is nice and we have had good service each time. Authentic mexican music plays in the background and makes the experience feel right. The sizzling fajitas are very tasty. I will continue to have good times here.  Not sure what some of the low reviewers are talking about. I suggest giving the place another chance now that they have had some time to settle in.

After a long day on the golf course with my Father and Brother we decided to give The Grind a chance. We were craving a burger and shake and wanted to try out this 1000 degree coal burger experience. Unfortunately we never got to the food.  We sat down at 6pm on a Saturday with out any problems, there was only 1 other table seated and now I understand why it was so empty. I am not a fan of pretentious places like this really. We are given some weird little folded up paper menus (that were stained with sauce) that when opened up read like I am at a fancy steakhouse. It took me a few seconds to even figure out where the burgers were on there. After looking though 15 or so different burger concoctions I decide on a $12 BBQ burger and realize that I now have to fork over $4 more for some fries. $16 for a burger fries? Wow, it must be good!  We all request a shake but our waiter (skinny guy with black moustache and goatee) explains that they don't have vanilla ice cream. He left and got us some waters and then when he came back we point out that there is a Fry's supermarket a few stores down and perhaps they could send one of the 5 other waiters that were sitting at the bar doing absolutely nothing to go get a $3 gallon of vanilla. He rudely explains that they have been going to Fry's for many weeks when they run out and it's too expensive to keep doing it so they were just going to wait until Monday comes along and their regular ice cream is delivered. Wow. All three of us look at each other in disbelief. Did he really just say that? We actually pressed him again about how easy it would be for them to send 1 person to go get ice cream from Fry's so they could make us the shakes that are on their menu and he got even more rude and told us the exact same story again. So because of their inadequate ice cream ordering skills the customer is now banned from ordering a shake  that is on their menu?   Is this guy telling me that rather than make at least $80-$90 off the three of us that going down to Frys to spend $3 is going to cause financial problems for the grind? In a business where customer service is so important and it's extremely hard just to get people in the door I am shocked that this server didn't care in the least about making the customer happy. In fact as we voiced our opinion out loud to him and the rest of the staff they pretty much laughed at us and did absolutely nothing to try and repair the situation.   All of this because a lazy, smart ass, waiter didn't give two hoots about the business or the customers in it. I would rather go to Wendy's and give them $12 for a Baconator than ever have to deal with that crew of amateurs again. I give this place a few months max before it is gone.   Go to 5 guys if you want a hamburger done right, they are adding milk shakes to their menu very soon as well which will make it perfection.  I will be sure to let everyone I know how sad this place is.

This place had me confused from the get go. First off, no parking except for valet, which even though is free you still always tip so it's not free. Is this Phoenix AZ or Los Angeles CA? The neighbors around this place must be pissed, if you don't use valet you have to park in front of their houses. The valet lot is tiny so they run out of room very quickly.  Second, is this a nice restaurant, a sports bar, or a playground for children? I was greeted with a line of about 20 people before we could even speak to a hostess so we just walked into the bar/playground area on our own. After wandering around looking for a seat a little tabled opened up and we took it. Uncomfortable little metal stools and a rickety wood top was what we had to deal with. There was no wait staff coming around to any of these tables so we got a beer from the corner beer bucket girl. $5.25 for a can of Fat Tire. A can. Not very impressive. I suppose I could have walked up to the bar area but it was stacked 2 deep with people waiting to get their drinks as well so I decided to go for the easy way out.  The shuffleboard game was being used by some 6 year old kids who were playing with the sand and not the pucks but the board itself looked like a cheap one and was not very long. We decided to pass up that game and hoped to play ping pong since there were two tables empty. When we went up front to get the paddles the hostess said "I guess the people who have those paddles are eating or something" and we were not allowed to play. The tables sat empty until we left. I noticed on the two tables that were going that there were many instances where people walking down the path were almost hit by the pong players. Ping pong doesn't seem like a good fit for the small space they put it in. Bean bags perhaps, shuffleboard sure, ping pong no.  I can't comment on the food because we never had a chance to order any and the wait for getting inside the restaurant was over an hour. I am sure the food is descent since it is a Fox establishment but the prices I saw seemed a bit steep.   Again, I am not sure what this place is all about but it definitely didn't feel right to me. I don't want to be hanging out with my friends drinking adult beverages and dodging 5 year old kids who are screaming and running around with no supervision. Is this place meant for families with small kids? Is it mean for college people? Is it made for jocks? Girls that like to get all dressed up? Older folks? Locals? I saw all of these people there and everyone looked out of place to me.   It will be interesting to see how it works during the summer time, I didn't see any misters in that outdoor game area. Good luck Yard, I doubt I will make it back though.

Went there for happy hour the other day. I really liked the other Modern mexican place down on Mill but this one didn't have the same feel even though the decor was very similar. I had the chips and salsa flight for $3 and the chips were rather tasty and the salsas were pretty good but I could have used some spice. The happy hour beer deal wasn't great, $3 domestics, $4 mexican beers and craft domestics and $5 for imports. The patio looked nice but gets nailed by the sun in the afternoon and can be hot even with the misting system. Wasn't a fan of the fairly loud lounge electronic music, the interior has so many hard surfaces it can get rather loud. I stayed for a beer and chips but walked across the street to Blue Martini for a much more fun setting with better happy hour deals. Service was a bit spotty. I am not sure that I would go back, perhaps I will give it another shot when it's not summer time.
