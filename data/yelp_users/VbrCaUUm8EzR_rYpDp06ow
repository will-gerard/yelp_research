There are many instances that have forged my opinion of this location, but this is the last straw.  This is ridiculous.  Checked my mailbox the evening of December 1, 2014 at 8:00pm.  I retrieved my letters and the package box key, indicating that I received a delivery too large to fit in my box.  When attempting to retrieve the package, the key would not work and the lock would not open.  I thought possible because of the colder weather the lock was stuck, so I even sprayed lubricant on the key and lock to attempt to coax the lock to open.  I called the 1-800-ASK-USPS and confirmed their offices were already closed, so I made a point of contacting them the following morning at 8:30am (December 2, 2014).  I spoke with a representative and received the local phone number for this location (Phone 602-235-9189 and Fax 602-235-9319) and instructed to contact them regarding the issue with  the key not working to the large package boxes at my condo.  When calling the phone number they provided the line just rings and rings.  When someone does finally answer, they sit on the phone or just hang it right back up, as if I can't hear them. I am not deaf, I am not calling on a TTY line.  I tell them I can hear them when they do pick up but still no response.  One of the instances they just took it off the hook and sat the phone down. I am not use to such horrible service from government employees.  Despite what I have heard of others experiences, this is a new one for me.  All I need to do is notify my carrier that the box keys don't work, but instead of just being able to relay that message, I am met with dead air on a phone line. I can't even retrieve my packages from the box and with their now shortened hours, it makes it almost impossible to reach them before they close.  I am a working, taxpaying American. I work 7am to 4pm and with my job being more than 20 minutes from the office, how likely am I to get service from their counter clerks?  Doubtful  Why is this so hard and why don't you subscribe to QUALITY and CUSTOMER SERVICE?  This is RIDICULOUS, CALAMITOUS AND SAD!!!

I'm not normally a person that goes to clubs but wanted to do something different & fun for my birthday. The experience I had last night is a prime reason why I've never been one to patronize the club scene, particularly in Scottsdale. First to be offered a "FREE Bottle/Table" for my *BIRTHDAY* but then required to "TIP" someone for service they have not provided yet I find totally misleading. This does not make it free. Second to have someone request to hold on to my ID & debit card to secure this "free" bottle & table is another ploy to try & coax someone into having an open tab. Third when brought to the attention of the "manager" Bradley, to be lied to about the resolution they have offered adds insult to injury, not to mention the service that we finally did receive was horrible. The waitress was inattentive, took glasses away from the table that were being used & left glasses on the table that clearly were not. I am contacting the Roxy directly to let them know I'm totally dissatisfied with the service & the whole experience & plan to dispute any charges they have placed on my card because if there were supposedly a value placed the horrible service we received it would not be more than $5, not even actual cost of the cheap Stanford Governor's Cuv√©e Brut Champagne that was served, which was worth only $8.00 a bottle. Even at a 100% mark-up for the "free" bottle wasn't worth $50. The crowd that the club attracts is not one that I feel comfortable being a part of & the "music" I don't listen to. I will be 38 years old on Tuesday & have a completely different definition of partying & how to have a good time.  Needless to say I did not enjoy this & unlikely to attend any other events.

David Daviss is a consummate professional and gentleman!  He and Kyle have been Godsends. I originally found Creative Touch through Amazon and read some of their reviews on Yelp and was sold. In August David and Kyle came out to my North Scottsdale apartment with my then boyfriend to provide us with an estimate for mounting my 60" tv. David was so patient and understanding to our budget and time. He was clear and concise with the timeframe and cost for the work. There were no hidden fees and he even gave me great deals on extra HDMI cables needed to complete the job right. He gave me excellent advice on options for enhancing my system. Unfortunately almost 4 months later, I had to have him unmount my tv & speakers to move to my new bachelorette pad in Tempe  Although the situation wasn't ideal David was so empathetic and has made this experience a pleasant one. He and Kyle made multiple trips to my new place (which is better, I might add) in order to make my vision come to fruition. I will use them again on my next move, into a property I own. I highly recommend them on any job, big or small. They truly have made me feel like a valued customer and friend!  Thank you David and your trusty sidekick Kyle!
