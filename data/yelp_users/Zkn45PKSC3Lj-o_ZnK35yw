I love Ulta, but this particular location ways has a ridiculously long wait when you try to check out. There are always a several employees on the floor and only one at the register.   It's actually crazy that there is anyone even on the floor since they are frequently out of product or under stocked overall. The employees are too busy talking to each other to provide customer service.   In fact, I've written this whole review while waiting in line. Again. I wonder how much cumulative time I've spent waiting in line at the Camelback Ulta? These are the thoughts I entertain myself with.

I would like to update this review with my most recent experience with this location:  I booked an online appointment for a gel manicure a few days before I was planning on coming in. I don't typically get my nails done professionally that often, but I wanted to look nice for my birthday weekend. The salon called me THE DAY OF MY APPOINTMENT and tried to move it to 45 minutes later than I originally planned. I work two jobs and this would have been impossible to accommodate in my schedule.   The only solution that the Ulta employee gave me was to book on another day for 10% off. No thank you.   I am very upset that I was only notified a few hours before my appointment. It is now too late for me to make an appointment anywhere else, and I literally don't know what to do.   Thank you Ulta for a horrible start to my birthday weekend. I don't plan on returning to your salon, and honestly, this may be the last straw for your stores as well.

Since I'm a glutton for punishment, I've read both of Ayn Rand's popular Objectivist novels. There are scenes from both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged that remind me of the atmosphere at MercBar, and I really love pretending like I am a character in the books. I take nerd to the next level, obviously.   The ambiance is timeless with the low couches, leather chairs, dark wood paneling, and super dim lighting. There are candles everywhere, and most of the customers come dressed very nicely.   The drinks are fantastic! The bartender, Brent, makes the best drinks: take advantage of it if you are able to snag a drink from him. The waitresses are all very nice and will walk you through their signature cocktails if you so desire.   I just tried the cheese and fruit plate, and I think it is the perfect pairing for any of the drinks on the menu. It provides a little something for your stomach while you throw all those drinks back.   This is really the perfect place for a date or a group of friends. The atmosphere is very intimate, but the music lends itself to a fun environment as well.

My date can't get enough of my cooking skills, so I agreed to make him dinner at my place one night. I had everything set up very nicely, and the food was shaping up to be superb. I was planning on a spinach salad, shrimp marinara, and coffee cake for dessert.   All of my dishes were coming out seamlessly until I pulled out a crystal platter to add ambiance to the coffee cake. The platter shattered in my hands just as the doorbell rang. I looked at the crystal on the floor and the blood gushing out of my hands, and I went to answer the door. "I had an accident" was the first thing out of my mouth.   After my date cleaned up the blood trail, he took me to the emergency room at John C. Lincoln. Even though it was a Saturday night I got right in to see a doctor.   The staff was so attentive, and the PA discussed all of my options for anesthesia and sutures. I was in and out two hours and four stitches later. And thanks to the awesome staff the pain was never too much to handle!

The Blooze is a dive bar by categorization only. It is much too clean, organized, and well lit to actually meet dive bar standards. A classy dive bar, if you will.   I went to see The Limit CLub play for Thursday Rockabilly Night, and the stage set up is fantastic! It has the whole lights/sound set up down perfectly. There are two 27 inch monitors mounted on either end of the stage so that people sitting in the back of the bar can see what's going on, and the checkerboard dance-floor is a nice touch!   Drinks are cheap if you like domestic beer or well drinks. And the bathrooms are super clean if your bladder isn't up to binge drinking! The ladies room even has pictures of 1980s hotties plastered all over the inside of the stalls.   Overall, this is a great little bar to see a local band and have a cheap drink. Just beware of the scary bikers that seem to perpetually hang out in front of places like this!

Alright, alright. This place is a little ghetto, and maybe I just like to go slumming sometimes. But I'll admit that really like Name Brand Exchange.   The store isn't the most organized, and their collection of designer clothes easily fills one rack: however, it is a great place to get cheap basics. Most of the women's tops were $7 or less, and I purchased a (real) leather jacket and a pair of practically new wedges for $20.   I also like that they have cheap (new) body jewelery because HTC can get a little pricey. These pieces won't have the quality that HTC provides, but if your piercings are healed everything should be alright.   Just look at Name Brand Exchange as a cheaper Buffalo Exchange, and understand that every trip might not yield the best finds. I plan on returning to Name Brand Exchange to see what else I can get for the low low prices.

Gentle Dental is a cross between the MVD and what I imagine the welfare office to be like. Waiting is how most of the time is spent at this location. Waiting 45 minutes after the scheduled time of your appointment to get called back. Waiting 30 or more minutes to see the dentist after your cleaning. Make sure to set aside at least 3 hours for a visit to Gentle Dental.   It is so obvious that every member of the staff hates their job to the Nth degree. No one is happy or at least cordial, and everyone looks burnt out. I've been getting my teeth cleaned at this location for several years (Thanks DVUSD for the great insurance!), and I have never had a decent experience.   The dental hygienists are a motley crew to say the least. I always get stuck with the slim male hygienist (I will not reveal his identity) whose hairy arms tickle my nose when he cleans my teeth. Yeah, that's for real. Just let that image sink in a little bit.   I really hate going to the dentist here, but I am stuck with these fine people until I get a new insurance plan. What makes everything worse is how difficult it is to get an appointment for this torture.

The Stock Shop is a bit of Peoria flavor. Both serious pet owners and those who just want to cuddle with adorable baby animals alike can find a haven for these activities. The owners are knowledgeable about care for a wide array of animals as well as very informed about the products that they sell.   I purchased my pet bunny at the Stock Shop over two years ago, and the packet that they gave me when I took him home is still very useful to me. I always get his food here too because they have the best quality rabbit food with the best price!

Nondescript shopping centers sometimes hold the best secrets, and nestled between a dry cleaner and a nail salon is one of those secrets. I've been eating at Island Teriyaki since high school, and I know that it is still a diet staple for the local high school kids.   Island has several menu options but the basic chicken and rice bowl is the best choice! Like Robert O. says, this is not the place for authentic Asian cuisine. Serving delicious food for very low prices, this is the place for a quick and tasty lunch.   I would steer clear on early release days because the Deer Valley kids (and even the teachers) swarm Island like a plague of locusts.

If the Travel Channel did a special called "Best Kept Secrets of the West Valley" then Caramba's would make the cut hands down. Sure, sure the decor isn't the greatest and neither are the bathrooms. But that's not what matters when it comes to Mexican food, is it?   What matters is the fish tacos (some would argue that fish tacos are all that matters). And oooohweee does Caramba's have some good fish tacos; possibly the "real" version of the imitation fish tacos that Rubios serves (Plato's Allegory of the Cave, anyone?).   The chips and salsa are good if you can stomach the salsa bar. Personally, just seeing food that anyone can touch and kept in open air has me running for the bathroom. But in all fairness it still tastes pretty good.   Now, we have arrived at the most important part of the review: the drink selection! Margarita's, mango and otherwise, and sangria rule the menu. They are cheap, delicious, strong, and most of all well worth the $3.00!   This is a great lunch or early dinner spot. I prefer to ride my tandem bicycle here, so that my suitor and I can both drink and ride home without in-dangering anyone but our bike.

I am updating this review for only one reason. It seems that I have spent years over looking Caramba's dessert menu. They offer a choice called "Cinnamon Crisps" which are warm cinnamon baked chips drizzled with warm honey.  The huge portion they provide is only $1.99.  You need this in your mouth. Now.

You know that old saying that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach? Well, what the originator of that quote was really trying to say is that the way to a man's heart is through Hot Bagels.   I've been going to this place for years; therefore, I always took the fantastic assortment of bagels, cream cheeses as well as the extremely low prices for granted. I knew Hot Bagels was the best place to get a fast and cheap breakfast, and I wanted to spread the word.   So I offered to bring my romantic companion breakfast one morning; his honed taste buds reawakened me to the rare deliciousness that is Hot Bagels. On a side note, I'm pretty sure the bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich sealed the deal.   If you are planning on winning over a romantic companion with food, use Hot Bagels. Might I suggest: lox spread on a sesame seed bagel, salmon on a salt bagel, or the breakfast sandwich on an everything bagel. Your love-life will flourish, guaranteed!

TIL: Eddie Basha, owner and CEO of Bashas' Inc., is a socialist. The stores that operate under the Bashas' Company include AJ's Fine Foods, Bashas', and Food City. He redistributes wealth from folks willing to pay $2.00 for an avocado to people that can only afford the fruit if it is 10 for a $1.00.   Now I know that the term "socialist" is a dirty word in these here parts, but hot damn AJ's has a good deli section. Actually, I'm not sure what you would call that combination of pizza, sushi, desserts, and other pre-made foods except, maybe, heaven.   I've been slowing working my way through trying all of these treats for a few years. I love the chocolates, cheese pizza, and salmon California roll! But these are just shining stars in a galaxy of treats! They also have a wide selection of iced teas which are cheaper and better than anything Starbucks has on its menu!   I can't say much about the grocery section except that they have really good breads and hummus. I would also check here for gourmet sauces and seasonings that an average grocery store wouldn't carry.   Whether or not you agree with Eddie Basha's wealth redistribution vision philosophically, let your taste buds agree with some dessert at AJ's soon!

Rule #1 of the Phoenix Metro area: Strip malls hide more secrets than your crazy ex. Mom was right, looks aren't everything. And a Safeway parking lot can house a day spa that is just as luxurious as places with much better digs.   The woman that shared all of these gems of wisdom with me, my mother, took me to Athena for the first time. We went for pedicures; the service was so-so but I was blown away by the atmosphere.   The salon area is a high-ceilinged room with Greek columns,  and a dome expertly painted with cherubs dancing around a sky scene. The nail area was behind the salon, and it featured several high-end massaging chairs and nice nail stations. The room also featured a large window that faced a fenced off area behind the spa with water falling across the window. The massage rooms are centered around an in the ground pebble-tech jacuzzi. This area is so beautiful and well designed; it is probably the crown jewel of an overall beautiful spa.   The staff is very friendly and try to go above and beyond to create a relaxing environment. Since I have no problem kicking back, I had a fabulous time. My poor mother, who usually hates when strangers touch her, loved her pedicure and massage as well.   Maybe you don't want to believe everything she says about your love interests, but take mom's advice on this one: Athena Day Spa is a great place to get pampered in the West Valley.

Everyone knows about Pei Wei right?! I really thought so until my boyfriend admitted that he had never been. Challenge accepted.   Now, I've been a frequent Pei Wei customer ever since I discovered Asian food did not always have to send to you running to the restroom. (Yeah, thanks for nothing Bing Heng and Great Wall Buffet). This isn't the best Asian food ever, but it is quick, accessible, and always pretty tasty.   I've tried everything on the menu, but my favorite options are the Crab Wontons and the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken. I ordered these plus the Spicy Korean for my n00b boyfriend to try, and everything went better than expected.   In fact, he even commented that the place was "classier" than he expected.   Just a side note: you can order and pay online, so you don't have to wait for the takeout line. You can also choose the specific time you would like to pick up your food.

Welp, they have animals. They aren't lion about that! (geddit???)  The Wild Life World Zoo almost has the feel of a conservatory because you are able to get so close to the animals. Often times, wooden half-fences or moats are the only things separating you from the animals. In fact, the Kangaroo exhibit puts only ropes between you and these vicious marsupials.   Other awesome exhibits include the panther, the penguins, and the giraffes. You can get pretty close to all of these animals, and you can even feed the giraffes!   I would advocate going in early spring or late fall to avoid extreme weather. Getting to the zoo early is a must because the animals are most active in the morning. And stop by the petting zoo because it is fun to actually get close to the animals after spending all day behind fences.

It's almost as if Cucina Tagliani doesn't even exist. Despite its visible location right off the Loop 101 freeway, I've never seen a wait. To some that might be a good thing; in my opinion, if it's too easy it's probably not worth it. And Cucina Tagliani proves that it isn't worth it time and time again.   Lets start with first impressions: tacky and unoriginal. The whole interior is decorated to look like some small Italian village or something. Oh gee, I've never seen that look before...Oh, wait isn't that what every Italian place looks like?   The food is so-so. Nothing special at best, and downright disgusting at worst. They don't even have spaghetti and meatballs. This place fills the Italian restaurant stereotype to a tee, and then they don't offer traditional Italian fare. It just doesn't make sense.   The service is just terrible. They never have enough people to keep everything running smoothly, and the waitresses are so fake. Working in the food industry myself, I'm not the kind of customer that asks for three sides of ranch after my food is already at the table. But even if you order the simplest items, the waitresses will still treat you like they'd want nothing more than to poke your eyes out with the rolled utensils.   With this deadly combination it's no wonder Olive Garden has a 45 minute wait at any given time, and Tagliani can't even fill the dining room.

My Valentine and I went here on the 14th of February mainly because we were at a loss of where to go, and we wanted something fast. Checking yelp, we decided on Greek Wraps because of its four star reviews, and I must say that I agree.   Though the staff may look like a bunch of Jersey Shore rejects, they are without the attitude that makes one "from Jersey."   The menu is pretty extensive for a walk-in Greek place. I got the Gyros Wrap and an order of baklava. My Valentine got the Falafel Wrap, and we split the hummus and pita appetizer. Everything was delicious. The meat in my Gyros was very tender and juicy (not dry like most of the places I've been). They also make all of the pita fresh as you order it.   I will return for more of this delicious grub soon!

Lo-Lo's you are so ghetto fabulous I don't even know what to do with myself. Actually, I do: order the Tre-Tre, mac and cheese, and a side of cornbread. And just bask in the culinary amazing-ness that is fried chicken and waffles. That's right, I just said bask in reference to breakfast foods.   Lo-Lo's is no ordinary breakfast fare; it can be enjoyed any time of the day. I prefer it after a few stiff drinks, when my cravings become insatiable. But let's get down to business:  Get the "red" kool-aid to drink. It's a little sweet, and I usually water mine down a bit. It's much better than the lemonade which is really tart.   I like the Tre-Tre for my main entree because it comes with two legs that are good to da bone and very easy to manage.   For sides, because I am like a ravenous animal at Lo-Lo's, I get the mac and cheese and cornbread. The mac and cheese is out of control delicious. It has baked cheese on top, and it is super creamy underneath the hard shell. I feel like a barnyard pimp when I eat the cornbread because of the large portion. It is very moist as well (I usually put a little syrup from the waffles on it.).   You don't have to be hood rich to eat at Lo-Lo's either. Everything is more than reasonably priced. All in all, I love dis place!!

I am no tanorexic, but I enjoy keeping a little color during the winter months. Since my schedule doesn't allow me time to catch the UV rays naturally I have to rely on the good old bulbs.   A coupon for $19.99 a month unlimited tanning was my incentive for choosing Aloha Tanning. It also happened to have a very convenient location and walk-in hours.   The staff was very helpful. They helped me decide on an ideal number of minutes to tan every day and helped me work up from there. I was also treated to a presentation on different lotions which helped me chose a good lotion for my skin type.   The facility is very clean. Sometimes there was a little bit of wait to get into a bed, but it was never more than seven minutes or so.   The only downside to Aloha is that their bulbs were not as strong as other tanning salons. But they were changed fairly often, and the ipod hook up in the bed cancels any negative feature out!

My confidant and I returned to Pullano's because we wanted to pregame night class (completely necessary). Our experience was much better this time around.   We were under considerable time constraints and our waitress was more than accommodating. She let us order four drinks at once, and she let us pay upfront instead of making us wait for our bill.   I was much more pleased this time around, and I hope that our experiences continue to remain positive.

Imagine a petite young girl handling a very large rifle, and you have the sum of my experiences at Shooter's World. I've taken advantage of several of their services including Ladies' Night and the CCW (Carrying Concealed Weapons) class.   I really like Ladies Night because it is a cheap way to let off a little steam, if you have the proper anatomy anyways. The range fees and rental fees are waived, so all you have to pay for is ammo. I make my conservative parents proud when I bust a cap in Osama bin Laden's cardboard forehead.   The CCW class is very informative, and completely unnecessary now that Senate Bill 1108 is official. The curriculum is really well-rounded; they cover gun maintenance, safety, and laws in other states. I feel a little more comfortable around guns thanks to this class.  The staff is very helpful with any questions about firearms. I often feel ignorant because I am usually the only female in the building (unless it's Ladies' Night), but the staff makes me feel right at home. My only complaint: I wish they would try to find better looking concealed carrying purses.

I hate being a girl when: 1. I need to lift something heavy. 2. I don't want to talk about my feelings.  3. I have to get my car fixed.   I failed emissions, and had to get my car fixed for the retest. I chose Carmen's Innovations because of their one positive review on yelp. I really appreciated that the staff treated me like human being of normal intelligence instead of the usual "dumb girl" attitude that other mecahnics use. The service was fast, affordable, and I passed emissions!

I thought the clutch went out in my car because shifting became increasingly difficult. I took my car to Carmen's Innovations, and they discovered that my brakes were the real problem. The cost of the repair was still reasonable, and my car was back on the road in 24 hours.

The west Valley's architectural geography is comprised of little strip malls with an anchor store (usually a grocery store), a nail salon, and pay day loan center. Nail salons are a dime a dozen, and they all offer pretty much the same services. Even though Vien nails appears to fit the standard mold they are so much better.   A typical French pedicure lasts about two weeks. And really only one before you have to pull out the ol' Sally Hansen touch up kit. However, I can go three weeks or longer with a pedicure from Vien. It takes them about an hour to complete the process because they massage your legs with lotion and do the hot stones. All of this is standard procedure as well.   The staff is so nice, and they even remember you after a while too. They are all very skilled at their jobs. I also love that they provide damn near every magazine known to mankind, and they have a flat screen for movies.   This is the place to get your nails did (excuse my Missy Elliott throwback).

I knew what I was doing the day I turned 18. The cigarettes, voting privileges, and tattoos could wait--first things first, I was getting pierced. HTC was the only option for me because I was impressed by both their informative website and 3-for-free option for newly legal adults.   The staff is very professional; they take their craft to a personal level with their commitment to each piercing they perform. The facility itself is very clean, and the sanitary practices they employ are fantastic. All three of my piercings-nose, tragus, and belly button-healed well. The jewelry is very high quality as well.  Fast forward four years, I have finally quit the job that requires my image to remain "wholesome" and "natural." I get to put my piercings back in: well, minus the nose which is a little too immature for me now. And HTC is, once again, the only choice for me!  The shop is as clean as ever, and their new selection of jewelry makes me want to go nuts with the needles or at least stone gauges. The piercers helped me choose a new stud for my ear, and they even put it in for me!   Sure sure, everything is a little bit on the expensive side, but you really get what you pay for! I HIGHLY recommend HTC to put any extra holes in your body!

Ranking right in between Last Chance and Nordstrom Rack in pricing, crazy customers, and cleanliness, the Dillard's Clearance Center is worth the foray into the ghetto.   They have unadvertised sales every week, knocking up to 75% off of the already reduced merchandise. I'm not crazy about the shoe or denim section but the rest of the women's clothes are awesome! They have special racks that will have dresses or skirts for anywhere from $4.99 to $9.99. The best deals in the store are on these racks.  Return often to check up on the sales!

When I took my boyfriend on a culinary tour of Old Town for one of our date nights, Grimaldi's was the first stop. For good reason too! I am of the opinion that this is the best pizza in the Valley. And if you think that Pizzeria Bianco deserves that title then I have four words for you "come at me bro!"   I could tell that my boyfriend was skeptical when we walked into the restaurant. It is very typically Italian with red checkered table cloths and the like. However, this place could serve me pizza on any surface and I would still eat it!   We orded a Cesar salad, medium pizza with ricotta cheese and mushrooms, and a bottle of Riesling.  The salad was so-so. I mean, there isn't much you can do to tweak a Cesar salad. It is what it is. And this one was a great pre-dinner snack.  The pizza! Oh lord, the pizza! So delicious! I highly recommend putting ricotta cheese on anything that you order as it is melty and delicious. We ate the whole pizza between the two of us just because it was so damn good!   We visited Grimaldi's on a hot Tuesday night, so we got right in. I would suggest making reservations if you want to eat there on a weekend night or during the winter months. Overall, it is a great experience with fabulous service, food, and atmosphere!

I still have dreams about elementary school field trips to Ceretta's. I felt like an extra in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory when I was here with my classes. I have even gone back as an adult, and everything is exactly the way I remember!   The rich smell of chocolate greets you in the parking lot, and by the time you enter the building you are literally salivating. The tours of the facility are interesting. The candy-making facts and tidbits of Arizona history make it a must for Valley newcomers.   The store section of the building is neat, organized, and everything is clearly labeled. The chocolates are otherworldly, making the only problem with Ceretta's my lack of self-control!

Hot dogs just invite phallic jokes, don't they? This is just one of many reasons I love their 100% beef goodness.   I'm not really into a ton of toppings on my hot dogs (I mean, just give me the wiener without all the bells and whistles), and they still serve the best hot dog with ketchup only in the Valley.   Since the fries only compliment the dog, I'm not going to go too hard on them. They really aren't the main event, and they are still decent.   Make sure you bring cash or Dazzo's will refuse you the frank.

Pete's Fish and Chips is a restaurant that really does things their own way.   Tarter sauce, vinegar, and lemons-these are three condiments one would expect to find at any seafood restaurant the world over. Not at Pete's: it's all about the red sauce in these here parts. I must agree with Pete's sentiment. The red sauce is simply fantastic, and compliments the deep fried goodness well.   I'm not 100% sure what Pete's uses as a main ingredient in most of their food. But I can tell you I'm almost certain it isn't fish. I can also tell you that I'm 100% okay with that.   Pete's does not accept debit or credit and is not open on Sundays. It seems like they are loudly proclaiming, "Customers! It is really NOT all about you. We have delicious food, and you must WORK to get it!"  And if that's how they roll at Pete's then I'm down.

My tandem-mate and I took our "bicycle made for two" here for a standard tune-up since we hadn't had one since we bought the bike.   The staff (owner maybe?) was very friendly and knowledgeable about our bike: an example, he told us that Shimano, the maker of our tandem, was notorious for poor gears. Our bike did, in fact, have a hard time shifting gears. But when we picked it back up he fixed them!  The Golden Spoke is a great place for a cheap tune-up (only $40!). The service will take a couple of days, but it is well worth the wait!

I'm not sure why ASU hasn't started using this place for research yet. Psychologists could study human aggressiveness patterns in the shoe section. Sociologists could study class stratification between the ebayers buying 15 designer handbags and the college girls buying 6 $1.00 tank tops. And an ethnographer could explore the interactions that people of a wide array of cultures have with one another in the line that usually stretches to the back of the store.   If you can't tell, this place is a zoo. An underground hell-hole with no cell phone reception where Nordstrom's returns go to die. If the land of misfit toys included Mui Mui's and Christian Louboutin's the Last Chance would be it.   I love this place. Sure you have to get rammed by a stroller or two to get anything good, but that makes shopping here much more interesting than at the mall with civilized people.   The first rule of Last Chance is that you don't talk about the Last Chance.   #2: Do not talk about the Last Chance   #3: Bring a buddy. People get vicious in the fitting rooms and in the checkout line.   #4: NEVER leave anything unattended. You will never see it again.   #5: Go on a weekday morning. There will still be a mob waiting at the door, but the weekends are not for the faint of heart.   #6: Go often. You will never find anything here on a whim. You must have a strategy.   #7 His name was Robert Paulson.   Ok, ok, enough with the Fight Club references. But seriously, if you follow these rules there is no limit to what you will find. I've seen several pairs of $100 Mui Mui shoes, $60 leather Juicy Couture satchels, and $6.00 Frenchie sweaters.   You can look like a million bucks if you have the patience.

Amare Stoudemire used to eat here when he was playing for the Suns; you may disagree with his move to the Knicks, but you should trust his judgement in burgers.   The Delux signature burger is pretty awesome, but I'm going to be real: I like the grilled cheese or the hot dog much better than the burgers. Even better than either of these are the sweet potato fries with aeoli sauce!  The service is fantastic! The waiters are some of the nicest I've ever met. Try to get Brad if you can!  Delux is open late, so it is the best place to go for food after a long night at the bars or clubs!

Eating at FEZ takes preparation; specifically in the arena of oral hygiene. Gum, mints, tums--these are all necessary if you want to continue socializing after eating anything on the menu.   I usually stick with the kisras because they are easy to split (the portion sizes are too much for me...they are HUGE). The shrimp is the best for sure, but I also like the italo.   I tried the Casablanca Chicken Sandwich last time, and it was exceptional. All of the ingredients meshed so well together. However, I'd do light goat cheese next time because it was really overpowering the sandwich.   All of the fry baskets are amazing, and the garlic and rosemary fries are the best. I really like the sweet potato fries too, but I think that Delux really has the market on those.   Drinking at FEZ, in the words of Jay-Z, is "so necessary." All of their $3 daily specials are awesome. I especially love the Pomegranate Presses on Friday nights (try the signature margaritas on Mondays, as well). Happy hour is available seven days a week from 4:00 to 6:30 and 10:00 to midnight. I really like that they still have happy hour on weekend nights!   All of the dishes are really good, but be sure to bring something to freshen your breath. If not, you give everyone you have close contact with a taste of your meal.   P.S. They have lint rollers available if you need them after you put your napkin in your lap. I love the attention to detail!

The patio area is just beautiful anytime of the day! I would recommend sitting outside if possible.   The menu is fantastic! My favorite items are the french fries and the mac and cheese. I know those are pretty juvenile dishes, but they are to die for!

As soon as we got word that class was canceled for the day we hit road with one destination in mind: Matt's Big Breakfast. This was my first experience with Matt's; my classmate is a little more cultured that I am, so he knew the ropes from previous experiences.   There really isn't a lot that the general public can use for parking near the restaurant, but I used my university parking pass to park in the ASU lot right across the street. Even though we went on a Tuesday morning the place was still packed. But the 20 minute wait wasn't bad because the weather was as nice as the outdoors waiting area.   Once we were seated (in pretty close quarters I might add) our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately. I got the honey lemonade which was such a great (and different) combination.   My classmate and I ordered the same breakfast entree: the five spot sandwich with a side of homestyle potatoes. Sweet Mary, the bacon on the sandwich was literally perfect. Everything tasted fantastic and complimented each other so well.   I will eat here again whether or not my class has been canceled!

Happy Hour, Happy Hour, Happy Hour!   I cannot stress this point enough! A friend and I got 5 appetizers, 2 sangrias, and a slice of buttermilk pie for $35!   Menu highlights:   The chips and guacamole: This appetizer comes with three side salsas and a big helping of the smoothest guac ever! The chips are perfect as well!   Buttermilk Pie: You will die when you taste this, I literally want to lick the plate after I've finished the pie.   The mac and cheese (the actual name escapes me): Green chili cheese and noodles, need I say more?   Sangria: I consider myself a bit of a sangria connoisseur, and they have some of the best I've tasted.   The atmosphere isn't bad with the dim lighting and all, but I could do without all the Arizona nature porn on the wall. But for cowboy chic food what can you expect?

The Clarendon touts itself as "A four star boutique hotel in the heart of Phoenix, Arizona." I'm going to call BS on that statement right now because I'm not sure who exactly is giving this hotel 4 stars but from my experience this weekend it can't be anyone who has ever stayed there.   My boyfriend and I wanted to spend some time by the pool this weekend since it was so nice out, and I suggested the Clarendon because I had enjoyed their pool before. We decided to make a weekend out of it so we booked a room. All of this spontaneity did not result in a good time.   We arrived on Saturday at 3:20ish, and I was really excited to lay out for a bit. However, check in took forever. I'm not even sure why because it seemed like we simply went through their standard process of signing our lives away and placing a card on hold for "incidentals." It was well after 4 before we even got to the pool and then we had to wait at the front desk again for towels which was super annoying. I ended up just taking a towel that I found because I really didn't want to spend any more time in the lobby.   When we finally got out to the pool, I began noticing that the hotel is definitely a run down establishment. All of the pool furniture is falling apart and stained (like really gross stains too), and the pool itself is missing tiles and has dirty plaster. But whatever, I just wanted to hang out so I covered my chair in the towels that it took my boyfriend 15 minutes to get from the front desk, and I tried to go on my merry way.   That was the point that I started noticing something else about The Clarendon; there are employees everywhere and they are watching you. For example, while my boyfriend and I were by the pool, I noticed some guy employee pointing at us to one of the front desk girls. She then came down to where we were sitting so I made my boyfriend go back up to the room with me right away. It was weird and I really didn't like it. Later that night we also saw this random security guard on the roof harassing this older lady. She was hanging out up there with some drinks, and it didn't really make sense.   We also had to wait another 20 minutes at the front desk to get ice. We were told "the owner doesn't believe in ice machines." Hmmm so let's inconvenience our guests and make them wait even longer to get a basic hotel amenity.   It is now 9:21am on Sunday morning and I am typing this review on my phone while I listen to housekeeping bang around the hallways right outside of our room. To say that I'm a little frustrated is an understatement.   I will certainly not be back to this hotel, and I also have no idea who would give this place four stars. Obviously, not very many Yelpers since they barely have an average rating on Yelp.

Who doesn't love a bargain? I get an adrenaline rush every time I find a great piece at the fraction of the retail price. I don't even mind if it is used as long as it still looks new-ish. I thought A Second Look would be a great place to get that shopper's rush, but boy was I wrong.   The place reminds me of my grandmother's closet because it has the hallmark finicky old woman organization. Everything is arranged according to color with signs everywhere proclaiming the consequences of touching and breaking. It is a little overwhelming.   The clothes are not that great. Everything in the designer section looks like it came off the Beverly Hills 90210 set circa 1990, and it is marked up like crazy. The rest of the store follows suit; for example, I saw a faded shrunken American Apparel dress for $13.00 (I can't even begin to tell you what is wrong with that picture).   While I commend the staff for meticulously keeping the store in perfect condition, I did not see anything that I would think of giving a second look.

This whole restaurant is about 10ft wide and 20ft long, and it is always packed. Now that I know better, I try to grab a seat at the bar for a little more elbow room; there are a few larger booths in the back too.   My boyfriend took me here on our first "real" date, and I'll have to admit that I was pretty impressed in spite of myself. I ordered the Pesto Chicken (decent) and he got the Lovely Bit a Salmon (much better). In subsequent visits I would discover the Royale with Cheese which is my favorite pasty so far. Also, the Mexican and the Carne Adovada are fantastic menu options.   Outside of the pasty realm, almost everything else on the menu is worth trying. The Greek Salad has to be my favorite of the salad choices; the dressing really makes this dish. Comprised of homemade caramel sauce, bananas, thick graham cracker crust, and whipped cream--the Banoffee Pie is to die for.   And now for drinks...they offer a pretty good beer selection. And Car Bombs are always $3.00 (yes, please!). The happy hour is alright, but Wednesday Wino Day is the best drink special ($3).   We can't wait to try the PB&J pasty for dessert next time we go back!

Things I liked:   - You can text your reservation at anytime   - The restaurant and patio are beautiful inside compared to the nondescript building they are housed in   - The waiters and bus boys were very friendly, knowledgeable, and alert to our needs (i.e. refilling glasses etc)   - The food was amazing! (Although, other yelpers have said the portions are shareable I finished my entree by myself)   -Drinks! The sangria was amazing (very strong)   Other than being slightly pricey (unavoidable for quality food), there isn't anything I dislike!

The hotel itself is just A-OK. It is getting on in years and until they remodel all of the guest suites it will be nothing special.   The pool more than makes up for the drab rooms! It features a slide, a play pool, a waterfall, a lazy river, and plenty of lounge chairs. I've never had to visit the pool area with children, so I can't really speak to the safety of everything. But I really enjoy the laid back atmosphere of this area.   The poolside drinks are really expensive. I recommend pregaming in your room and buying one more down by the pool!

I want to create a time line showing how Bajio went from my favorite early release destination way back in high school to its current situation. I can only guess that the brief period that the restaurant closed down only to be reopened under new ownership was the tipping point into bad food territory.   Thanks to Henry Ford, this place uses an assembly line to create the Americanized Mexican food that it churns out for its customers. I usually get a plain bean and cheese burrito because I'm not a big fan of most of their toppings. I've always liked that the food comes with free chips and salsa.   I've tried other menu options like salads and chicken burritos, and everything is just so-so. I want this place to return to its former glory with the shouting for tips such, but I think that the current environment is here to stay.

I was nervous wreck the first time I ate at Ginger. Not because I was worried about getting dysentery (you know how those Chinese restaurants can be). But I was meeting friends of my manstress's parents for his father's birthday.   The place is great for groups, and they had us seated at a large table in the center of the room. I chose a seat at the end so I wouldn't be completely surrounded by people I didn't know. But all of my worries were put to rest since the whole crowd, like my parents, were teachers.   As the beverages began to flow, our table got louder and louder. No one seemed to mind, and the staff was very attentive.   All of the food was simply outstanding, and since we passed our dishes around for everyone to try I go to taste quite a few. I would highly recommend the both the sesame chicken and the spicy shrimp.   The delicious food paired with a great setting and staff really made this potentially awkward encounter much more comfortable.

I have been stalking St. Francis for months.   Let me explain, I drive by every day on the way home from work, and I can't help taking my eyes off the road to check out this ultra-cool restaurant. I began harassing Sean M. to accompany me to taste the menu so that I could stop creeping and start enjoying the food. My persistence paid off, as it usually does, and we made St. Francis our top choice for Sunday brunch this weekend.  The wait was a little long but the day was beautiful and I wasn't raging around like a hungry monster so I didn't mind. We were seated after about 30 minutes, but you can make reservations to avoid waiting if you prefer.  We started brunch by splitting a cinnamon roll. It was moist and covered in caramel sauce which was a nice touch to the iced variety that I am used to. It was huge and only cost $5.00. Totally worth it.   Up next was the salmon eggs benedict. This is one of the best versions of this dish I have ever had. The flavors just work. The english muffin is sourdough with some kind of garlic-y spread underneath salmon, perfectly poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. Amazing!  We did not sample the drink menu on this trip. I am of the opinion mimosas and bloody mary's should be between $3-$5 on Sundays (it is the day of rest, after all), so I couldn't do the $9 that the menu was asking for.  Overall, a wonderful experience! I can't wait to check out the menu for my other favorite meal, happy hour!

Just a bragging point: I've totally been to the original Heidi's Brooklyn Deli in Denver, Colorado. Its Peoria counterpart is a fantastic place to get lunch in the West Valley.   I have sampled quite a few of the menu items. I do tend to stay away from anything with mustard, ham, bologna type meats, and rye bread. However, the meatball on Italian bread and the chicken marinara on French bread are delicious menu options. I also like the Club sandwich on the croissant. They also have a "build your own" option if nothing on the menu looks appealing (an impossible feat). Every sandwich comes with a bag of chips and a pickle.   The milkshakes and malts are made from real ice cream (also available by the scoop) with generous portions. All of the desserts are fabulous, but they advertise the cheesecake as "homemade" and I'm pretty sure it is not.   Heidi's also serves breakfast, but I've never gotten around to trying it. I would love to sample their lox bagel because it looks out of this world.   The prices are more than reasonable for the portion sizes and quality that Heidi's offers! My only complaint is that the restaurant keeps odd hours. It seems like they are never open when I get a sandwich craving!

I ditch class more than I should probably admit on this public forum, and the last time I found myself walking away from my night class my best friend and I decided food was in order.   My best friend, Samantha B., does not have a Yelp. She should. In fact, I would like to dedicate my current Elite status to her because she knows every great restaurant all over the city. I often accompany her to these food havens because I sugar momma her with rides to ASU West.   Samantha B. introduced me to Market Bistro on the fateful day that we ditched night class, and I have been craving it ever since. We got a salad and Mac and Cheese.   The create-your-own is fabulous; ten items for $7.99. Parmesan chips, grapes, mixed springs, corn (?!), walnuts, olives, and five other things I can't remember made up our salad which was big enough to split. I questioned her judgment on the corn. I really did. I now see the error in my ways. Of the dressing choices we got ranch. Now, I don't even like ranch. But guess what? You're going to like it! And I did too--on this salad anyways.   The mac wasn't as good as the salad, but it was alright. I wish it was fresh and came in larger portions.   Next time I ditch class, I know to go to Market and get corn in my salad. My cravings are telling me to ditch class soon.

Let's get real here, Buffalo Exchange hasn't been very good since the early 2000s. Sure we all still stop in but mainly to exclaim, "They want $70 for these True Religions?!?! Just look at the hems..."  Sunset Clothing Exchange has almost the opposite effect. I find myself almost joyfully yelling, "OHMYGOD!! Look at this French Connection dress! The tags are still on, and it's only $20!!!" Their clothing selection isn't extenive, but everything is high quaility and most of it is new.   The staff is not comprised with snotty hipsters; most of the employees are genuinely kind and interested in fashion. The fitting rooms are clean and well kept just like everything else in the store.   Not that the decor really matters, but the art on the walls and in the fitting rooms is really cool. The overall effect is very chic, and I love it!

I take snacking to a level only attainable by few when I go to Pho Avina. Though I have eaten a full meal here, I am only going to review my favorite snack.   I love getting a boba tea and the veggie spring rolls after I get out of class or when my boytoy and I go tandem-ing. The service here isn't the fastest, but I don't mind waiting for the delicious food.   The peanut sauce really takes the a-ok veggie spring rolls out of this world. If I could find a discreet way to lick the sauce container after my rolls are finished, oh boy I would.   The boba tea compliments the spring rolls well. My personal favorite is the coconut, but all of the other flavors I've tried are good as well.   Just a quick tip: $10 minimum on all credit/debit card purchases.

I'm just going to reiterate everything that all of the other yelpers have said about Switch but (hopefully) in a more cohesive manner.   I took my boyfriend to Switch to celebrate a recent work promotion, and the restaurant offered the perfect setting for a happy occasion. Everything about the decor is perfect for an early to late dinner date.   The server was awesome! I was still pretty inexperienced with drinks of the alcoholic persuasion, and our waiter really took the time to help me decide on a beverage. We both ordered the sangria (trying sangria from different restaurants has since turned into a little bit of a hobby), and it was delicious. They use plenty of different types of fruit and put a lot of it in the drink which is a rarity.   The food followed the drinks in both quality and taste. The Pesto Chicken was very flavorful, and the Caesar Salad also tasted great. I want to try the Mac and Cheese next time I eat here; I saw someone else order it, and I was very impressed.   For the service, food, and atmosphere the prices are too good to be true!

Coffee, soda, and energy drinks are not for me. A good iced tea makes my world a better place, and Souvia Tea is the best place to get freshly brewed tea.   Every time I walk into Souvia Tea I feel like I am in a modern East India Trading Company outpost. Hundreds of different teas line the walls, and the place smells so rich. Choosing a flavor is usually pretty difficult, and mixing teas is allowed which makes the process even more difficult.   I LOVE the Souvia Sushi (like the green tea served in sushi restaurants) mixed with Mango Dream. Every flavor is available served hot or cold. I am usually just purchasing the tea for myself, so I am not well versed in the whole pot of tea option that they offer.

This is restaurant is one of my favorite places to go for sushi. I only go at happy hour, however, because it is much MUCH more affordable.   My favorite rolls are The Damn Good (the name does not lie), The Tootsie, The Vegas, and the Philly! The Long Island Iced Teas are wonderful, and the atmosphere is not bad. I like it as sort of pre-Scottsdale club sort of place (loud music, big flat screes, etc.).   I don't really like that the rolls come out on the same plates because it makes group outings pretty difficult. The service isn't fantastic either, but you can't argue with the prices.

After the excruciating four hour long Barrett Honors College convocation ceremony my parents took me (new graduate) and my boyfriend out for celebratory BBQ. My dad talked Lucille's up like it was better than Pappy's in St. Louis. He raved about the biscuits, the ribs, and the apple butter for days before we attended my ceremony, and I was really excited to try the food. Disappointment does not even begin to describe our experience.  The restaurant was relatively empty at the time of our visit. The hostess sat us at a table that could, possibly, have doubled as the freezer. The AC was turned way to low on a relatively cool evening, and I was shivering throughout my entire meal. I know that this isn't the hostess' or the waitress' fault, but my mom asked several times if they could turn up the AC or move us.   The food was terrible. I ordered a full rack of ribs for $26.99 and they were burnt to high hell. Paired with the AC, my whole plate was cold in five minutes flat. I ordered Mac and Cheese as both of my sides and that was decent. My parents also split a burnt full rack of ribs, and my boyfriend had an average tasting pulled pork sandwich. We were served terrible quality food for the pricing of this restaurant.   Our waitress was really nice, but I think she should have noticed how burnt the food was that she served us. I understand that we visited the restaurant at 9:20pm on a Wednesday evening, but their website showed that they take reservations all the way until 9:30pm. It is just really unfortunate that this establishment doesn't take more pride in their product. People go to restaurants on memory making occasions, and a bad dinner can ruin a good moment. Lucille's would do better to remember that in the future.   TL;DR Burnt food, terrible for the price, will ruin your graduation experience.

You know that scene in every "small town girl goes to the big city movie" where the stereotypical "small town girl" sees the city lights for the first time? She gets this cheesy look in her eyes like she finally found her way home. I'm pretty sure that I had that same nauseating look on my face when my date walked me through Bomberos' door.  But everything was perfect. With candles and well-groomed plants everywhere, the flagstone paved courtyard is an absolutely beautiful entrance to the dimly lit restaurant. The former Sunnyslope Firehouse is all exposed brick which looks amazing in candle light. The little round tables facing a live music area just completes the intimate feeling of the restaurant.   We ordered glasses of sangria and bruschetta to munch on while we watched the Latin band. Everything was fantastic looking and tasting! My ONLY complaint is that the restaurant was a little too noisy to enjoy a sustained conversation.  This is the perfect place for any sort of date. From that awkward first dinner to "Friday night date night" this place will put stars in your partner's eyes.

I'm glad that living in the southwest has benefits other than excessive use of cacti in home decor. One of those benefits is the food served at Z'Tejas, and I will gladly put up with any number of hanging serapes to get my hands on Tex-Mex.   This is what you need to order (no exceptions):   1. Drinks: Chambord Margarita  2. Appetizer: Cornbread (so moist!)  3. Entree: Seafood Enchiladas  4. Dessert: Berry Cobbler.   You will need to take a food coma after you have successfully finished all this food. But, and trust me on this one, you will finish it because everything they serve is addictive. I would have literally licked the cobbler pan if I was not in public.   Your pants will be bursting to make up for the weight that your wallet loses over the course of this meal.

I hate the gym: I feel like a hamster on a wheel when I run on the treadmill. When I hike I feel like I've accomplished something, and I do some of my heaviest thinking and hardest hiking on the trails of Thunderbird Park. There are three separate mountains, and I've hiked every set of trials numerous times.   H-2: This is the trail that begins at 55th and Pinnacle Peak Rd. I trained for the Susan G. Komen half marathon on this trail because the steep incline on the west side of the mountain is a great place to build endurance. The whole trail is about 3 miles total, and it is easy to complete the loop in around 45 minutes. I stopped using this trail because it is really rocky, and I sprained my ankle pretty badly on the steep decline.   H-3: To hike this trail I usually park along Pinnacle Peak Dr. (not to be confused with Pinnacle Peak Rd.) because the major incline is located right off this road. It takes me a solid hour to finish this trail which is about 4 miles total. The path goes behind all of the mansions, and I love seeing the design of all of their backyards.   H-4 through H-4b: I usually hike all three of these loops together for an hour and a half workout. The top incline is small loop in itself, and I do this mini loop about 6 times for a really hard workout. This is one of the busier trails because it has two parking lots: one on Patrick Lane and 67th Ave. and the other right off of 59th and Pinnacle Peak. This is probably the best trail for kids and dogs because it can be modified to be as easy or hard as you like.   Here are also a few rules for new hikers:   1. Don't be offended if people pass you. Everyone has different levels stamina. On this note, please be courteous and allow others to pass if necessary.   2. Please clean up after your dog. I see people that pick up their dog's waste, and still leave the bag on the side of the trail. Even though this park is well kept, leaving the plastic bag is still equivalent to littering.   3. Control your children.   4. Be aware of the wildlife. I've seen rattlesnakes on these trails a few times. One even slithered across my path about 5 feet away from me. It is a good idea to become well versed in snake or scorpion bite care in case of an emergency.   5. Bring plenty of water. During the hot summer months it is easy to know when to hydrate, but it might be more difficult during the winter months.   Overall, this is a great place to get outdoors and workout! Hope to see you on the trail!

My family and I have been here a few times. I have never had a good experience, but for some reason we continue to spend our dinners at Lakeside. I guess you call it Applebee's syndrome; you know it is nasty but you keep coming back.   After last night, however, I will never be back. We went for "Wacky Wednesday" which promoted $5 specials. The prices are $6. The portions are so pathetic that I am sure this little promo works out in the restaurant's favor. Less food for more money!  We also ordered the chips and salsa which provided us with a mentally stimulating family discussion: do you taste mold or disinfectant? We never came to a conclusion because we had our waitress take it away as quickly as possible. They were unable to bring us more because the entire batch tasted like that. Homemade salsa my ass.  So Lakeside, you can keep your false promotions, horrible portions, and disgusting salsa.  Good thing the service isn't too horrible or you'd really be in trouble.

Do not bring your appetite to Sens as the portions are tiny (Thus, tapas). However, do bring your taste buds because everything on the menu is delicious.    The decor is so fresh, and the patio is the best seat in the house if it isn't too hot outside. This place is great for small groups of two to four, but the portion sizes are just not accommodating for groups any larger than that. Unless you plan on ordering multiples of each dish.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable about both sake and the Canadian TV show Trailer Park Boys. He really took the time to explain the menu and joke around with us.   This was a great place to celebrate a birthday or other event because it is has an intimate feel, and it is centrally located to other bars and entertainment.    Menu highlights: sweet wontons, garlic edamame, Mango Monkey cocktail

For some reason I thought this little vegan restaurant was a craft store. I have no idea why that impression came to me, but it was probably because of the logo.   My boyfriend and I found this place on yelp, and once my craft store assumptions were put to rest we decided to try it. We ordered two appetizers, two main dishes, and a dessert-- all for $20! Everything was fantastic! And I can't wait to go back for seconds!  Someone commented on the lack of atmosphere, which is understandable, however, it is important to remember that this establishment offers cheap, delicious, vegan food. I think the fact that it resembles an IKEA is forgivable if we take these truths to heart.

People the world over have set aside Sunday as a time to fulfill religious obligations in a church or a temple or whatever. I, too, devote Sunday to a spiritual undertaking of sorts. Brunch: the most important of all Sunday traditions, and Gallo Blanco is one of my favorite houses of worship.  I begin my service with a holy communion of mimosas. I reflect on the salvation that the blood of distilled grapes and fresh squeezed flesh of oranges provides to me.   Then the divine Huevos Rancheros speaks to me through a chorus of heavenly flavors. The housemade tortillas, perfect blend of cheeses, and spicy tomato sauce brings me to my knees in a prayer of thanksgiving.  The saints that staff this wonderful establishment are very helpful and attentive. They are always happy to bring out an additional round of mimosas or to explain any menu item.   I will religiously attend brunch at Gallo Blanco because their food is amazing, and the wait is not as bad as other brunch hotspots around downtown.  Amen!

I felt a little bit like a country bumpkin when my boyfriend walked me through doors of Sage. I mean, I have been to a few nice restaurants in my day, however, I have never been the youngest person in the room at any of those places. In Sage's case, that's probably because when people my age visit Vegas they partake in the $19.95 buffet at the Imperial Place and drink margaritas out of large plastic cups. I am extremely happy that my boyfriend and I have either better taste or deeper pockets than most of the 21-25 year old crowd because this restaurant is delicious!  We started with drinks at the bar towards the front of the restaurant. Sean said that his Martini was one of the best he ever tasted, and my peach bullet was just unreal. The bartender was awesome. I couldn't decide on my pre dinner drink, and he helped me choose based on other drinks that I do like. He also spent a good twenty minutes giving Sean and I a lesson in different absinthes. He let us smell all of the different kinds that Sage offers and taught us about both the French and Russian methods of serving it. Fun fact: Sage sells the most absinthe of anywhere in the world.   We were walked into the main dinning room which is decorated with deep purples, dim lighting, and dark wooden tables. After being seated, we were given bread and creamy butter with an array of spices mixed in. After that the chef treated us to a sample of the soup of the night. I can't remember what it was called, but it was fantastic.   We ordered beef tartare for our appetizer. I was a little hesitant to try it, but I am so glad I did. It was probably one of the best tasting foods I have ever had. I can't really compare it to other tartares because this was my first time having it, but as a N00b I really enjoyed it.   I ordered the spagetti with scallops, lobster, and octopus as m main course. I also really enjoyed that, but it was a little too much after the starters.   We ended with a hot chocolate and orange soup. It really put the final touches on the meal. Everything was perfect. Our main server and the other staff that waited on us through out the night really made it a wonderful evening!

I was recently invited to join the Dutch Mafia by two really really nice baristas at Dutch Bros. Coffee. I was concerned that there would be some sort of "coffee in, coffee out" ritual that would require my participation, but I was assured that I had nothing to worry about. And that is how I became a card carrying member of this organization. Also, this card gives you one free beverage after you purchase 8, so I would recommend joining the ranks of the Dutch Mafia.   I am not much of a coffee connoisseur, as in I enjoy the instant shit that is provided by my place of business, so you can disregard my opinion. However, I love the coffee at Dutch Bros. Just a plain old cup of coffee is really tasty.   They are also happy (like really happy, not faking it) to accommodate any other requests that you have. Once I asked for a half coffee half steamed chocolate milk (delish, bee-tee-dubs), and I got just what I wanted. They are even willing to experiment for you too, like the one time I got a kiwi-pineapple Italian Soda.   I highly recommend stopping by for a drink if you ever happen to pass a Dutch Bros. If anything the uber nice beverage specialists will restore your faith in a kind-hearted humanity.

I grew up in the West Valley, and I was so disappointed when Water world closed down. I loved everything about that place from the urban myth that someone died on Mt. Kilimanjaro to the crusty nachos. But when Wet'n'Wild started to build those brightly colored slides I got over my disappointment. Only to be let down again.  Not only is Wet'n'Wild WAY overpriced, but Waterworld offered much more to do for a day's visit. The slides are fun once or twice, but the two hour wait is not worth it. And even the wave pool has lost its old luster.   I guess everyone has to visit Wet'n'Wild at least once to get it out of their system. And to see just how the hell that funnel-looking contraption works. Take it from me, Wet'n'Wild is just not worth it.

I'm a total foodie, and portion size is the best way to win me over (that's what she said). Even if the food is just mediocre, but the restaurant serves a ton of it I'm happy as a clam. Two Hippies Pizza has BOTH good-sized portions AND delicious tasting food, so I'm in hog heaven.   Splitting the $12.99 pizza and wings deal, my romantic interest and I got the burchetta pizza and 12 BBQ wings. We also got two of the lemonade slushies (they are ALWAYS out of the good flavors), delicious as always.   The burchetta pizza is fantastic, but be sure you have gum for afterwards because the resulting garlic breath is enough to end the Twilight franchise for good. The wings were a little too saucy for my liking but still tasted very good. Make sure to bring some sort of wet wipe to clean yourself up afterwards because they don't even have a bathroom for handwashing.   The food was good, but the service was fantastic! The staff was so friendly and helpful at all points of the meal process. They even let us use their  hand sanitizer and paper towels to clean up afterwards. My romantic interest got enough BBQ sauce around his mouth and on his face to resemble Edward Cullen fresh from the kill. In fact, I'm not sure what is worse: his face or that I know enough about Twilight to make these references.   TL;DR The prices, food, and portions are good, but the staff is great!

A place that inspires me to decorate my house like the bathroom must be reviewed!   Modern Burger is an adorable little restaurant, perfect for happy hour after an afternoon shopping at Fashion Square.   The sliders, fries, ice cream sandwiches, and chopped turkey salad are perfect. Everything from the portion size to the price to the presentation is wonderful.   They have changed their happy hour since my last visit, so I need to go back soon. But I will be going back and that is the important thing.

Once upon a time in a strip mall far far away was a little Thai restaurant whose exterior appearance was deceiving.   You see, young reader, the same derelict strip mall held a charter high school and a run down ACE Hardware. But those who could successfully navigate the cavernous parking lot and fight the Jack-in-the-Box monster were handsomely rewarded for their efforts.   Yes, Thai Iced Tea so fantastical and Coconut Pineapple Rice and Chicken that could please the pickiest princess were housed within it's otherwise frightening walls.   The homemade Coconut Iced Cream and Sweet Rice is worthy of its own fairy tale. Perfect was its flavor and consistency of texture.   The kind owners are more than willing to bestow their magical gifts of food on any weary traveler that should choose to stop in for a feast. A small fee is required for their kindness, but even a pauper can afford this fare.

First impressions are always important, and I was wowed by the Gothic meets Modern meets British Invasion decor. In fact, I liked it so much that it may have colored my opinion on the restaurant quite a bit.   For starters I had the soft pretzels with cheese fondue which was so delicious! You get a basket of large pretzel pieces and a substantial pot of cheese. More than enough for two people!  Then I had the Chicken Gorgonzola salad. It was the perfect cool dish for a hot summer day. I wish it had a few more apple slices in it, but over all it was a great salad with the perfect amount of dressing.   Our waiter was attentive, but it could have been because the restaurant was pretty empty relative to it's size. Although I imagine that it is packed on weekend nights.  I was also pleased that they brought out black napkins for me since I was wearing black pants. It was a thoughtful touch!  I can't wait to go back and try something off of their extensive cocktail menu! Too bad drinking isn't acceptable during working hours!

I felt as though I walked off of 59th Ave. and Bell Rd. and into the Matterhorn ride at Disneyland as I came through the doors of Le Chalet. I think the decor is a little kitschy, but the food more than made up for the faux French/Swiss castle look.   My boyfriend's mom and I split the Swiss Cheese Fondue with apple slices and baguette as an appetizer. It is advertised as a main dish, but it was perfect for a starter as well. Be careful with the adjustable flame on the fondue pot: we ended us burning some of the cheese to the bottom of the pan because we wanted the cheese to be more melty.  We split the La Potence for the main dish. We opted out of the extra 8 oz tenderloin, and I am happy we did because the Swiss Cheese Fondue was very filling. The homemade sauces that come with the dish are so savory. The meat is perfectly tender and flambeed at the table. The chef seriously uses like four and a half shots of whiskey in the process!   We also split a side of sweet potato fries, which my boyfriend's mom thinks were perfect. I agree completely! Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, these non greasy fries were so good!   Some fun facts about the restaurant:   1. They have television screens that show the chef making crepes in the kitchen.  2. The owner is Swiss and the chef is a beautiful French man complete with accent.  3. They have comedy shows and concerts in a little ice grotto stage thing in one side of the restaurant. Our waitress informed us that the shows have a $10 minimum per table plus a $10 cover charge to get in.

Anything that is well organized holds an instant attraction for me. If it is well organized candy, well, I might just die of happiness.   Sweeties is modest warehouse in C-Town that boasts a wide array of candies both nostalgic and new. They have everything from bulk to Cerreta's to a wall of Pez. I especially like their system of disposable scoops and gloves in the bulk candy section because it ensures that your candy was not previously manhandled by an out of control three year old.   My sweetie and I got about five pounds of a wide assortment of candy for about $30. Rock candy, hot dog gum, salt water taffy, gummie sharks--these and many other kinds of candy made up our purchase. It's not the cheapest I've ever seen stuff like this, but I've also never seen this much candy in one place.   This would be a great first date idea, and if you keep a lookout they often offer $5 off $10 purchase coupons.

Thank you Yelp, for another great find in the ASU West area!  Hand breaded onion rings, homemade chili, and a wall full of sodas--I hope I sold you already. If not, try cheap. Like ridiculously cheap for every menu option.  Not much ambiance, but for a great burger, who's complaining? I like the bare bones decor, and I'm sure the high school kids would destroy anything more than that. Speaking of high school kids, if you want to avoid those heathens try to make to Rocket Burger before 2:30pm!

In the interest of cheap wings, my boyfriend and I decided to visit the Buffalo Wild Wings on their $0.60 wing Thursdays. That was our first mistake.   We got to the restaurant at about 3:00pm, and it was completely deserted. this wasn't a bad thing, but it was kind of eerie in such a large sports bar. We were hoping to take advantage of happy hour drink specials, but their happy hour does not start until 4:00pm.   Consisting of 27 wings in 3 different flavors and an order of fries, it took about 15 minutes for our order to arrive. These were the nastiest wings I had ever seen; they appeared to be deep fried and then sparingly slathered with different types of sauce. The sauce-to-wing distribution was inconsistent ans stingy. Some of the sauce even appeared to be congealed because it was improperly heated.   The fries were just as disappointing as the wings. They cost $3.69 and were smaller than the portion size available at In-n-Out Burger (not as delicious as INO might I add).   The total for our 27 wings, one order of fries and two waters was around $30. Now I can think of many restaurants that I would have preferred over Buffalo Wild Wings that serve much better food similar pricing. This negative experience was exacerbated by the fact that we came here because it was cheap.   TL;DR: Don't eat here if you have any sense of dignity.

I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine. I'll bet George W. was rigging that election too.   I am a hot dog aficionado so anything decent in a bun would garner a good review from me. Needless to say, I was heartbroken to discover that Joey's was not what I thought it was.   A couple of my fellow In-n-Out coworkers and I decided to meet up at this restaurant for lunch to "talk shop" so to speak. After ordering we attempted to get ketchup. This is a typical waiting for food activity, is it not? And wouldn't one expect to find a plethora of ketchup at a place the sells hot dogs? Well, no. Or at least not accessible ketchup anyways. There was a container with a large bag of ketchup available, but exactly how one was supposed to procure said ketchup still remains a mystery.   After giving up the ketchup quest, we tried unsuccessfully to find a clean table. "This would never happen at In-n-Out" was fighting furiously to escape all of our lips by this point.   Then our food came out, disappointment ensued. Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal. The taste did not make up for the portioning either.   TLl;DR: Go to Wienerschnitzel or Costco if you want a hot dog.    EDIT: I ate at Joey's sometime in January, and there were a total of 3 other customers in the store which doesn't excuse a filthy dining room.  The ketchup was not empty. There was a large open container of ketchup sitting on the drink station. Since that violates several heath codes in addition to being extremely pointless, I'd say there is no excuse for that either.

I want to compare the fabulous estheticians at European Wax Center to a good prostitute. You go in, take your pants off, they do their job, and you pay. No awkward conversations while you are getting your Brazilian. And what could be worse than pretending to have a lovely conversation with your cat out for everyone to see?   The whole facility is really clean and classy. They have a wide array of non-dog earred current magazines in the waiting area. However, they are usually so prompt with their appointments that I have never had to wait long enough to open a magazine. Perhaps this explains their good condition?   The waxing rooms are also clean and private. From what I've observed,, they use the same sanitation practices that doctor's offices employ. The wax is 100% organic beeswax, and it is supposed to be less painful than other waxes. Personally, when I'm getting every hair in my pubic region pulled out in large strips I don't much notice a difference.   The overall indifference to nudity was a little unsettling. They ask you to remove your pants and under-roos while they are still in the room. And they tell you to assume positions I wouldn't even do in front of my lady doctor. I just tell myself that they see vaj-jays 20 times a day and mine is nothing shocking. I find that this method, along with avoiding eye contact with the waxer and hoping I'll never see her again, is the best way to deal with such an uncomfortable experience.   All of the estheticians do whatever they can to make you feel alright about getting waxed. The only practice I don't really like is how they push products on you at the end. Oddly, I find this to be the most awkward part of the whole visit! I really like European Wax Center, and their pricing is also very reasonable; it only costs $39 for a Brazilian, a service that would cost $50-$70 elsewhere!

I don't do sexy well. All of my attempts at seduction end in horrible awkwardness. Drunk on sake from Nobuo, I attempted to give my boyfriend the ol' bedroom eyes. He told me later that I acted like a mid-range call girl the entire evening.   My BAC was partially due to my empty stomach and patially due to previous alcohol consumption. We had already been waiting an hour and a half for Pizzeria Bianco and a bottle of wine later we decided to get some sustenance to help us through the next hour and a half of the wait.   While I wasn't making a spectacle of myself, we enjoyed the Teeter Tots and Steamed Pork Buns. Our waiter was an expert in the field of sake and helped us pair these two dishes with a great bottle of the stuff.   The Teeter Tots, Panko crusted tofu with a dipping sauce, were so good. I always look for a similar menu option at every Japanese place we go to now, but nothing has come close.   Now, I admit I do not normally like steamed pork buns. But I was drunk and in the mood for adventure, so I gave these guys a shot! Second best  outcome of an intoxicated decision ever!  Get frisky at Nubuo if you have the chance!

There is literally nothing more appealing than a warehouse full of trampolines, meaning Jump Street is probably one of the coolest places on the west side of the Valley.   $10 gets you in for two hours on Tuesday/Thursdays, and you'll get your cardio workout for sure. They have a large area just for jumping, as well as, two smaller "arenas" for dodge ball. You haven't played real dodge ball until you've done Hollywood stunts on a trampoline to avoid getting hit.   They have several "extra" attractions that cost a little more than the regular trampolines. It's all worth it if you go on the days that have cheaper pricing. There are also designated kids areas for smaller children to play without the possibility of getting hurt by a rambunctious high schooler.   I love this place, and I'm not exactly a kid anymore either. In fact, when my better half and I visit this place we might just be the oldest people jumping. Jump Street offers serious fun to all age groups; check out their website for videos and special pricing.

I have only been for happy hour, but it is a five star fare!   My high status man candy and I had several margaritas over chips and salsa all for under $20.   The Casa Margarita is a little sweet, but very good once the ice melts a little bit. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't offer a blended option, but I was happy enough with on the rocks.  The chips were light and crunchy and came with three different salsas. I liked the brownish green stuff the best (sorry, the real name escapes me). The tomato based salsa looks and tastes like marinara sauce and the pico is way too chunky.   The decor is adorable! I loved everything from the Ikea lighting fixtures to the over-sized Dia de los Muertos skulls. I also liked the half the bar was inside and half was out because it really opened up the area.   I can't wait to go back for more!

In the field of architecture, the Modern Era refers to the time period when designers produced buildings that were supposed to be timeless. Ideally these structures were to have a very functional form with their sharp angles and use of common materials. Post-Modernism, as a design school, exists to playfully mock the "serious" designs of the Modern Era. Agave Library is the perfect example of everything that is wrong with Post-Modernism.  Verging away from the "form meets function" philosophy of the Modern Era, the Agave library is the least functional building I have ever seen. It is all concrete, exposed air ducts, and wires which would be fine except every noise echoes like a gong throughout the "quiet" area.   The study rooms are comprised of glass walls, small round tables, and hard multi colored plastic chairs. They are laughably inadequate for hours of studying: the tables are not large enough to hold both a textbook and a laptop and the chairs are so uncomfortable for long periods of time. There are rows of tables for studying, but there aren't enough outlets for laptop users.   The book collection is tiny compared to bigger branches like Juniper. However, I really like the interlibrary loan service. It allows Phoenix Library users to rent books from any library and have them sent to any convenient branch.  I really wish the City of Phoenix would refrain from trying to make a statement with every public structure. Modernism and even Post-Modernism can be done in a tasteful way that is appropriate for a public building.

I bought the Groupon for the $25 Mani/Pedi like so many of the other one star reviewers of Vivaldi Salon Suites. So just a fair warning, this review is 100% for the scheduling assistant/owner (I think they are the same person...?):  I called to make my appointment after purchasing the Groupon on Feb. 1st. They could not fit me in on a Saturday until March 9th. I was willing to wait that long, and I figured that it would be nice to have a professional polish job for the start of open toe shoe season.   While I scheduled this appointment, I was clear that I wanted to be scheduled at the Citadelle location on 59th and Utopia. I was under the impression that the scheduling assistant understood the words I said since she did not indicate any differently. Apparently, I needed say something different than, "I would like to be scheduled at the 59th and Utopia location" to actually be scheduled at the 59th and Utopia location.  I didn't find out until 10:15am on March 9th (15 minutes after I should have begun my appointment)  that I was actually scheduled at the Park West location which was not communicated to me ever. I guess the scheduling assistant isn't very good with words or something.  When I tried to call the main line to talk to the owner about getting my money back or some other appointment, I was simply told to call Groupon. No apologies. No help. just call Groupon. Great.   So I did. And I am not sure if I will get my money back or not, but I will not EVER go back to this Salon Suites again.   And if the owner is indeed the scheduling assistant then she should do us all a favor and fire her self.

I was so excited to see a restaurant concept like Betty's Nosh pop up on the west side of the Valley, and I was simply ecstatic that it surpassed my expectations!  My friend and I stopped by for an early weeknight dinner. The menu is changes frequently, but the night we were there they had button mushrooms with various toppings. I had three mushrooms with a warm crab and cream cheese mixture on top. Let me clarify that this is real crab and not the fake stuff with a K. This dish may sound small, but it is VERY rich.  I also got a side of mac and cheese which was pure creamy deliciousness. Our waiter was kind enough to give us each a side of Caesar salad for free. He also gave us two mini chocolate and peanut butter cupcakes for free. It was pretty slow the night we went which may explain the behavior, but it was much appreciated no matter the motivation.  I got a Long Island Iced Tea to go with my meal, and it was "okay." I'll let that slide sine Betty's is much more of a restaurant rather than a bar.   I can't wait to keep checking back for new menu options!

To enter Narnia all one has to do is step into a wardrobe. The NM Cafe, however, requires a small traipse through the Neiman Marcus men's section. Finding this hidden gem is well worth it because delectable sandwiches, soups, and salads await you!  This is the perfect place for a lunch that will easily fit into the hour that most companies give for a noon break. It is quick, filling, and just a great place to relax. The simple decor and color usage almost gives NM the ambiance of a day spa.   I got the grilled cheese with broccoli cheddar soup and a side salad. It is out-of-control yummy. The sourdough bread that the sandwich comes with has the most perfect flavoring! The tomatoes pair well with the melty cheeses too.  The desserts are beautiful looking, but I have not had the chance to sample anything yet. I can't wait to try the cupcakes though!  Forget the adventures in a smelly old wardrobe and get lost in the men's department. Perhaps you'll find your way into this fabulous little cafe.

I always think of the word habit as a nice way to describe a drug problem. For example, Whitney Houston's coke habit (too soon?) or Heidi Montag's plastic surgery habit. I would say that I might have a Habit problem since I eat here about 4 times a week.   Think of Habit as the love child from an orgy between In-n-Out, Five Guys, and Smashburger, but cheaper and more delicious. It is from California like INO, it has many topping choices like Five Guys, and it has other non burger options like Smashburger (although, no alcohol unfortunately).  I've had almost everything on the menu, and I highly recommend the Swiss Mushroom Char and the Albacore Tuna Sandwich. The Sweet Potato Fries are very good. I would actually say that they are better than anything I've had at more expensive burger joints (*cough* that means step up your game, delux and FEZ *cough*).  The malts and milkshakes are pretty good also. I haven't tried requesting anything crazy like a Neapolitan shake, but I don't doubt that they would make that for me.   All in all, this is a great regular spot because it is cheap and consistently delicious. And consistency is a very rare quality to find in these kind of fast food-like restaurants.

I lived at City15 from September 2012-September 2013, and I had very few problems with the staff or the apartment while I lived there. Here is a list of positives and negatives that I experienced:  Positives:  Maintenance requests were handled quickly, and I had very few problems with my actual apartment while I lived there. I think I had to call maintenance about 3 times total and they were always prompt and professional while they fixed whatever was broken.   The property was kept very clean.  Management was helpful for the most part. There were a few situations that could have been handled better, but they were overall responsive and willing to help.   My apartment had wood floors throughout and a large closet. I feel as though the amenities that I received for the price were very good. The only reason I moved out was due to increased rent.   Negatives:  The water boiler broke in March 2013 and the entire complex was without water for 14 hours or so. I felt as though management could have communicated the situation better as I did not even know that there was an issue until I called.   The community is gated. However, shady people still find their way into the complex to go through the trash cans. I also witnessed two people stealing a bike, and the gate broke a few times which caused people to be locked in/out of the complex.  They had an online payment portal when I moved and then the property management company switched over. The new company, Greystar, could not accept online payments. It was really annoying to pay by check or money order in 2013. It's like, come on we have technology.  I didn't experience this, but there was apparently a rash of car break-ins in the parking lot. Someone put flyers up about it all over the parking lot, and they were removed pretty much immediately.   Overall, this place is ok to decent for the cost of rent. There was a mix of shady people and single professionals living in the complex, so some of the negatives are almost expected. I've experienced much worse as far as apartment complexes go, and I would definitely consider living here again should I work in an area nearby.

I seriously love this brand. More importantly, though, I love this store in particular.   All of the girls are super helpful! For example, I came in with a Pinterest board full of shit and one of the employees showed me around the whole store to help me find what I was looking for. She even worked with me in the fitting room to make sure everything was adjusted correctly.   In a world inundated with different yoga brands, Lorna stands out as an awesome experience. Everything is beautiful and bright and really inspires you to want to work out!

My aunt is one of those people that fixes up a house until it is perfect and then sells it immediately to move on to the next project. When I was interested in moving to Scottsdale, I obviously turned to her for advice on which realtor to use. She recommended Secure Real Estate (I worked with Charlotte Allred), and I was so happy that I followed her advice.   Charlotte took her time to understand my needs and really worked with me to get a home that fit my specifications. I really appreciated the time that she took with me since I wasn't looking for a multi-million mansion or anything :)  Overall, great service! I will use her again in the future!
