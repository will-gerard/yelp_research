I'm a big sushi fan and not incredibly picky, but this experience was very odd. The Yelp reviews were good so we went. They were busy when we got there so we waited a bit which wasn't terrible but consistently the service was slow and another waitress had to basically take over our table. Worst of all, the sushi was bizarre. I ordered an Alaskan roll and spicy tuna and the Alaskan came out as a gigantic roll with piles of salmon and mayo-filled fake crab salad and no avocado. I appreciate the value I guess? but having the huge roll with that in it was inedible and I have never not finished a sushi roll. The spicy tuna had tons of mayo-y spicy tuna and then more fake crab mush. Our tofu tempura appetizer came out after the entrees. The music was also strange- loud 90s music. The hibachi chef clanging in the corner with a gaggle of women yelling 'woohoo!' didn't add to the experience. Not sure we'll be back.

This place is AMAZING. We went to celebrate an occasion recently and were pretty much blown away by the food. We moved from NYC and are kind of foodies and their food was as good as any we had at a nice place there.  The place is nondescript on the outside and the atmosphere's a little wonky since it's attached to the wine store, so you can literally see into the wine store in some spots of the restaurant but after a bit I didn't mind. It's BYO which makes it all the more of an experience (and saves you some dough). The menu changes quite a bit, but the escargot was excellent, and husband had the fish which he loved. My steak was good, if a bit fatty.  The service was fantastic..we started chatting with the waitress about hotels in Mexico and she went and printed us out something she recommended so we didn't have to write it down! We would definitely come back in a heartbeat. Love, love, love. Not too many places like this gem..I hope they stick around.

So, I've always liked Chelsea's Kitchen...I like all the LGO places. The decor is beautiful, the food is always good. And it was the same last night except for the one thing I can't get around - the horrible service. I usually feel that food trumps service, and as long as the place is nice and the food is good, I can deal. But the service last night prompted this review. We walked in and clearly there were tables, but we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. Fine..they text you when your table is ready. But once seated, we had one waitress come to our table, we weren't ready to order drinks, so she put a folded piece of paper on the table mysteriously and walked away. Then a whole new waitress came over, no explanation. She seemed disappointed we decided not to have drinks. Appetizer came out with bacon on it, when we asked for it without. Then was somewhat rude when answering specific questions about entrees. Took away the plates without asking if we were done with our food, and then dropped the bill on the table without asking if we wanted dessert. Asked for some condiments - took forever getting to us. It seemed like she had made up her mind about us and then decided to not care about our table. Reaaaaallly disappointing. The food was good as always (entrees - 2 taco platters, one Del Mar salad and a Ahi tuna burger) and if we didn't have cocktails for that one time is that a reason to be rude and disappear? Not cool.

We had walked by this place many times and had even gone into the store side (attached to the restaurant) to get some hummus, but had never gone into the restaurant. Finally went for lunch today with friends and was really happy we did. Attentive, quick service, super yummy food. Had the falafel which wasn't dried out, in the pita boat, which is just their pita sandwich..it was pretty gigantic. Friend had a gyro combo, which she was pleased with. And their baklava is to die for..some of the best I've ever had. I think their pita is homemade too..stretchy and fresh. It's not the prettiest place, but for cheap, authentic Middle Eastern food you really can't go wrong.

Ordered some takeout, and their pho was really great! Having just moved from New York City, the Asian food hasn't exactly been the same, but this place seems pretty authentic. Great flavors in their pho..tried the seafood and the chicken/broccoli/bok choy one. Definitely recommend!

This was the first place I came to when I moved here and I find myself returning. Their prices are pretty good - $12 for a manicure, $30 for gel polish, $30 for mani/pedi. They always do a good job (with the exception of one time) and I like that their space is big and clean. Sometimes they have you get up and wash your own hands which is annoying and their polishes are somewhat disorganized (though it seems they've been making an effort lately). There's one man who may be the owner who did my gel polish last time (first time I tried it) and spent a lot of time and attention which was appreciated. It's convenient, good parking, and open fairly late. I always go back!

This place is super fun - we had a girls' night here and it was a blast. Their margaritas are excellent, and the food was pretty good (though not super amazing, but it was more about the atmosphere and drinks). Great place to go if you're in the mood for something upbeat. Love that their bar is large but service is never a problem. Will definitely go back.

Dave is super great. I came in originally after finding an ad in the mail for an oil change, and he was very nice and mentioned he did all kinds of mechanic work. I went back recently to get a new fuel pump (and then a starter) and I heard him call around for the cheapest parts. He's not necessarily the fastest, but he's pretty close to the cheapest, and you know you're not getting scammed. Recommend!

Went here for the first time a few weeks ago. The owner was snoring when I walked in, so that was odd and kind of a turn off. Their regular manicures are cheap- $10, but the experience overall was so-so. It got busier as my manicure was going on, so it got a little better. Parking is pretty bad..they have approx. 3 spaces. Manicure was fine..have a range of OPI but all their polishes were jumbled together which I hate. Overall, for a few dollars more there are better places, even down the street.

This place might not look like much on the outside (or the inside), but the food is truly phenomenal. (And we think of ourselves as pretty decent foodies). We came late on a Wednesday night, and they're only open til 9, but we were told to help ourselves. When we told them we were vegetarian/seafood eaters, they said they would custom make our dishes for us, separate from the buffet. It then turned into an amazing meal as the mother/owner/chef asked us what we wanted and promptly went in the back and started cooking for us. We weren't too picky, so we ended up with a tofu green curry and a shrimp pad see uew. We also had salad first, with an interesting semi-spicy vinegary dressing, maybe a tamarind? that was delicious, and then the entrees were crazy good...amazing flavors like no Thai I've tried, and it was the best Thai I've maybe ever had. They also brought us out some fried shrimp, and we had a Thai iced tea (mmmm coconut milk). They topped it off with dessert, which was homemade pumpkin custard, that had rice and red bean on the bottom, and coconut ice cream on top. The mother/chef was so lovely and chatty and made sure we liked her creations, and even brought out the leftovers of it. It felt like we were in her kitchen :) We had a Groupon and felt so bad for the kind of food and quality that we had gotten and what we paid that we left a doubled tip. If only it was a little nicer inside, I'd love to be there every week, but the food makes up for it. Will definitely go back...yet another amazing hole-in-the-wall find in PHX!

Normally this place, being a Fox concept, has good service and food. Being there before a Dbacks game last night, however, they fell down on the job. Extremely busy and understaffed, we got there in time for happy hour, but didn't receive a happy hour menu, and no one came by. We waited and waited, and were able to only place one drink order. This took 15 minutes to come to the table. Some of our appetizers were missing. We ordered a smoked garlic toast, and it came in a mason jar of oil with some garlic in it.. and no toast. They were confused when we ordered toast for it, saying that was not how it was served. Um, okay. The salmon rillette was pretty decent, as was the provolone fondue with pretzel bread (served also at Cuilnary Dropout). But we were really disappointed. Zucchini was a bit on the soggy side (probably having sat for a while) and the hummus was mediocre. Have more staff on game days! The server was also incredibly irritating, rambling on about their oyster specials and all kinds of other things before we could even order a drink. We had to get a busboy to actually bring us our drinks in the end. Just unfortunate.

These guys are amazing! Last year I needed a fan replaced in my Mac and this year a memory upgrade. They're quick and professional and so reasonably priced! For the memory upgrade, I was in and out in 20 minutes, and the guy talked me OUT of spending more. I thought I was going to have to buy a new computer and just needed more memory. Definitely recommend if you want great service and a good local business to support!
