I purchased my third Audi just a little over a week ago.  You can say I'm a fan of Audi, and you can also say I'm a fan of Audi North Scottsdale.    My first Audi was a 2009 A4 and gosh darn it I loved that car.  But, after 50,000 miles and 5 years, it was time for something new.  I traded in the A4 for the brand spankin' new A3.  Nice car - I held onto it for a little over a year, but it just wasn't the same as my A4 that I missed so much!    I kept my eye on the pre-owned inventory at Audi North Scottsdale off and on for awhile as I was in search of a  CPO 2015 A4 with low mileage.  When I found one I was interested in, I went in to take a look.  Although the beauty that initially caught my eye had sold the night before, they did have another that fit my search criteria - this one red.  I drove her, liked her, and set to work out a deal with Steve, my sales guy.  When the numbers weren't to my liking, Steve suggested I lease a brand new 2015 A4. I wasn't really into that deal either, so I let it go, thinking it just wasn't meant to be.  Fast forward to a few days later and I get a call from Steve, asking what it will take to earn my business. I told Steve what I wanted and he made it happen! The red beauty is now sitting in my garage. Loving this car so much that I don't even mind sitting in traffic on the 51 every morning!   I appreciate Steve's diligence and professionalism, and I'm happy to remain part of the Audi family. My one complaint is that the car wasn't totally clean when I took delivery. For this, I deduct one star. I was able to bring the car back in a few days later for a full detail, but I still feel it should have been taken care of before I initially drove it off the lot.

Great experience at the Vig Uptown!  After getting the runaround trying to make a reservation with the Fillmore location, Brittany went above and beyond to help me make a reservation for 18 people with just two day's notice.  With such a large party, one might not expect top-notch service, but the Vig's staff proved otherwise.  Our server was friendly, attentive, and on-the-ball.  Everyone in my party was pleased with his/her dinner and drinks - we will definitely be returning.  I highly recommend the Vig Uptown for your next celebration.

Two stars, but only because the food was good (when we finally got it). We went on the 4th to grab a few drinks and apps before the Diamonbacks game. The place was crowded, but we found a table right away. Our server was initially attentive, getting us water and taking our drink orders. It was happy hour (on a Saturday afternoon - bonus!) so AZ beers were $3 and appetizers were a few bucks off. We quickly placed our order for the chicken drumsticks and scotch egg, then later decided too add filet bites and Brussels sprouts.   About 30 minutes later, the chicken drumsticks came out. Quite a bit of a wait for chicken, but they were busy and the chicken was tasty so we were happy. Now about 45 minutes into our dining experience, the filet bites came out. No biggie, we added them after our initial order. They were good - nothing to write home about, but good.   As we conversed, listened to the live music, and drank our beers, I politely asked our server if our other snacks were coming. "The kitchen is really backed up, but I'll check on them," she said. Meanwhile, tables who arrived after we did were finishing full meals. Our server had clearly forgotten the rest of our order and was quick to pass the blame.   Now about 70 minutes into our visit, out come the Brussels sprouts. Meh. I make them better at home. Plus the balsamic and butternut squash with the char of the sprouts and parmesan was just a weird combination.   Now we need to hurry it up and bear the nasty heat to make it to the game on time. Thinking I could flag our server down to remove the scotch egg from our bill, she was of course no where to be found. We are now about 90 minutes into our visit and out comes the golden, err, scotch egg. Delicious! We scarfed it down and were able to get our check (finally). When it came, however, our server had charged us full price for the sprouts and egg. Another clear indication that she forgot them.   Bill is settled, we are on our way, and now are late for the game. We missed the first inning AND the national anthem on the Fourth of July!   I know this is a long review to say we had shitty service, but I did want to point out the positive notes. In summary, nearly 2 hours to get some beers and appetizers without dilly dallying with our orders is a little excessive. I get it when things are hopping and busy, but having your server lie to you about dropping the ball on your order and then overcharging you while trying to pass it off is totally UNACCEPTABLE. I won't be back to dine before any sporting events or comedy shows. There are too many other restaurants with good service that are more deserving of my hard earned dough.

This evening my boyfriend and I decided to pick up some takeout on our way home from Christmas shopping. We walked in the takeout door into a chaotic mess. After 10 minutes of waiting in "line," we were finally greeted at the register. I say "line" because it was really more of a cluster of customers being randomly waited on by one of four confused Pei Wei employees.  While attempting to place our order, I repeated "chicken" about four times because the young man questioned what kind of protein I wanted in my "kung pao chicken." Um, chicken in my kung pao chicken please. When my boyfriend attempted to order his spicy Korean steak, the young man spaced out and could not comprehend "steak." "Steak? What do you mean, steak?" A young woman walked over and scolded, er, showed him how to enter the entree. "He wants steak!" Young man: "He didn't specify that!" Young woman to my boyfriend: "It helps if you order backwards from the order of the menu." After the awkwardness settled, the two employees then parted ways from the register and left us unable to complete our order. They both continued to wait on other patrons in the "line" and completely ignored my question of "Um, can we complete our order?" We stood there as I glared at any employee who even slightly made eye contact. Still nothing. We left. The restaurant business is too competitive for this location to operate in such a terrible way.

It was easy to cross this one off the list!  While apartment hunting in the area last weekend, my boyfriend and I decided to stop in the leasing office at the Legend.  According to their website, there were several two-bedroom units available, most around the $1200 - $1300 range.  Pretty reasonable pricing, considering the area.  Well, it appears there is no connection between what is listed online and what is actually for rent, or at least the office staff does not have access to the same information that is on the website.    In addition to the disconnect regarding available units, the blonde girl who "assisted" us was beyond rude with a snotty attitude and a major chip on her shoulder.  I don't know her name as she never introduced herself.  She acted as if we were imposing on her Saturday afternoon activities by stopping by during business hours.  She pulled out her leasing information binder, hastily flipped through the pages, then proceeded to tell us there were only 2 two-bedroom units available, both priced at more than $1500 a month.  Since our moving date isn't until October, I asked if there was anything else with upcoming availability.  Nope.  I guess that, with this particular apartment complex, they don't have access to that kind of information, nor would it be an option to hold a unit for any amount of time until your desired move-in date.    So without even showing us floor plans, let alone offering to show us a model unit, we were then provided a list of move-in expenses.  Among the list of expenses?  A $200 Admin Fee and a $50 Gate Fee.  When I asked what the Admin Fee was for, she replied, "It's just a fee we charge.  Everyone has to pay it."  Um, okay, I get that there are fees in this world but usually they are associated with something specific.  I'll be damned if I'm going to pay a fee just for the sake of paying a fee.  "And the gate fee, is that something that is refundable upon moving out, provided you turn in your remote?"  "No, that's a fee that is charged to keep the gate in working order."  Really?  I mean, $50 is $50, it's not going to break the bank, but maintenance is usually something that is included in the price of renting an apartment.  That's one of the reasons people RENT apartments.  I wouldn't be surprised if this place charges for landscaping, too.    With every question I asked, (they were all normal, inquiring-about-a-place-to rent-questions), the girl's attitude became increasingly hostile and rude.  Like, as a customer, I don't think I've ever dealt with someone who was so rude to my face.  Her face scrunched up and her tone became high pitched like she was mocking me - almost as if she was impersonating our conversation behind my back, after it had passed.     She then proceeded to tell me about how the property is managed by Lincoln, a company that prides itself on customer service.  It reminded me of a child's conversation as I expected her to follow it up with, "Just kidding!  It's opposite day!"  If this is how prospective tenants are treated, I can't imagine what she is like to deal with on a somewhat regular basis, as an actual tenant.   If customer service is really something that Lincoln prides itself on, someone needs to take a look at the office staff and their professionalism.    On a side note, the leasing office decor is dingy, ugly, outdated, and mismatched.  There were also loose cords hanging in all sorts of places.  Pair this with nasty staff and it certainly doesn't make for a good first impression.

I'm a huge fan of the OHSO Arcadia location, and a so-so fan of the N. Scottsdale location.  The PV location definitely ranks higher than N. Scottsdale, but isn't quite up to par with Arcadia.    Pros:  The place is huge!  Lots of activities, and plenty of seating.  There are also lots of misters and giant fans to help make the patio scene bearable in the summer heat.  Service was great and very attentive, especially while seated on the patio waiting for our table.  At other establishments, you usually have to fend for yourself at the bar for drinks while waiting to be seated.  Nice job here, OHSO.  Good food and, as always, lots of delicious beers to choose from as well.      Cons:  Well, there's really just one.  There are kids everywhere!  I hate to sound like I'm anti-children because I'm not - I love kids. I just think there is a time and a place.  Late afternoon/early evening hours?  Fine, I get it.  Parents want to chill with friends after the workday and enjoy a bevie or two.  But when it gets to be like 8 or 9... I'm not here to tell people how to raise their kids or anything, but I just sometimes prefer to enjoy my evening beers on a patio without kids running around everywhere.    So, given that the PV location's atmosphere is more family oriented, I think I'll be more likely to visit the others when I'm in the mood for chill drinks in the evening with friends:  N. Scottsdale when it's just drinks (the food is not good there - I don't know why they can't get it right) and Arcadia when I'm looking for good eats to enjoy with cold ones.
