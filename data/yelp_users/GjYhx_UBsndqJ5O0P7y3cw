Oh AJs, you never let me down for delicious, impulsive purchases.  Only in you could I drop 11 dollars on a deli lunch and be happy about it.  Or get excited about baked goods.  Or buy fruity beverages I have never heard of just because I see them there.    AJs is the perfect combination of hippy products and profitable business.  It has things that seem earthy and organic, but actually taste good and make sense.  It makes too-lazy-to-cook me extremely happy.  I have yet to try the same thing twice at the deli, bakery or Italian pasta/pizza counters.  To justify the lack of a fifth star, it is really obnoxiously expensive to shop there.  But, worth it in general  Don't expect a bargain, but do expect to find really delicious and appealing products in every isle!  Also, the potato gnocchi is probably the best thing I have ever tasted.  No lie.

I am leaving my previous review below, but I subsequently had a terrible experience here.  I needed a new car headlight, and they screwed it up and fried my car.  It took three employees hours to get the headlight changed, and in the process of troubleshooting the damage that their sausage fingers had done in the engine, took out some fuse box thing and put it back upside down.  At that point nothing electronic in my car worked, and the car itself wouldn't start the next day.  A competent mechanic fixed it, but it cost me a significant amount of money and time in towing and mechanic fees.  Autozone was not interested in reimbursing me for the damage they had caused.  Old review: I just got home from having a new battery put in my car, and I was super happy with my new favorite car store!    I am incompetent at cars, so I went in saying I thought my battery might be mostly dead.  It was.  Car stuff's expensive.  I'll forgive them.  The Autozone kid was super helpful though.  He spent a good half hour inside car, removing the old battery (my car is the "labor intensive" kind of battery holder) and gouging out all the corrosion I had let accumulate.  A half an hour!  He could have easily just told me to do it myself.    Many a restaurant or retailer could learn from the Autozone business model.  Good service is awesome.

Super fun nerd store with comic books, some games, and fun gifts.  It is unusually clean with really nice salespeople.  They also have fun events periodically.

This is always a hit.  It's my go-to Mexican restaurant in the area, and the food never disappoints.  I wouldn't call it terribly unique, but the food is really, really solid and they have lots of great options.  I love the taco salads and enchiladas especially.  The one thing I can't figure out is their salsa strategy.  There are chips and two different types of salsa.  One is served in a little cup and is way too spicy for me.  The other (delicious salsa) is served in a carafe, so you have to pour it in something to use it.  Puzzling, but not a huge problem.  I definitely recommend Ajo Al's.

This is my new favorite Indian restaurant.  Anywhere.  I had the lunch buffet, which was delicious, and after that I have mostly ordered Palak Paneer with naan and rice.  Their's is fantastic!  So delicious!  I love this place because it tastes so good, and because it is close to home, but the reason this place stands out among its peers is the service.  This place has really, really good service by any standard.  Waters get refilled promptly, waiters are helpful.  Orders are accurate and the staff is really friendly.    Yay!

Yelp totally led me wrong here!  This place is relatively inexpensive, but I didn't find the atmosphere charming or fun and the pizza tastes like something from a school cafeteria.    Granted, all I tried was one pizza but it really stood out as a place to avoid in a neighborhood with plenty of fantastic pizza and other Italian food.

The food here was shockingly awesome given its appearance!    We went here randomly because another restaurant was closed.  It does not look like much.  Sketchy parking lot - complete with a pile of vomit by the ramp!  The inside is cramped.  We ate in a room that looked like it had been something else originally, with way too many tables crammed in.  I ordered a pina colada, and stupidly chose the large size.  Large is a ridiculous understatement!  This thing was the size of a fish bowl or something.  Not one of those stupid beta fish bowls either.  The large drinks mean business!!  It was pretty good too.  Everything we ate was really, really good.  I had the burrito and my friend had a taco salad.  Everything was great, including the salsa, but the taco shell was AMAZING.  So perfectly cooked and tasty.  It's weird to get this excited over a taco shell, but it's totally warranted.  So good!!  I would definitely go out of my way to get something with this amazing shell in the future.

I 'm not going to lie, I love laser tag!  I've been playing it mostly with my dad since I was little, and it is still so much fun.  Laser Quest is by far the best venue I have ever found for laser tag.  They have two story, multiple-tower mazes that you can lose yourself in, or at least find new spots every time you play.  It seems like every couple games a player gets malfunctioning equipment, but that's inevitable.  It has the obligatory quarter games and air hockey tables too.  It's all about the game though, and I think Laser Quest has by far the best set up!

This store is so much fun!!  I know I am still a child inside when I go in here and want to play with everything.  They have all kinds of toys that I remember from my childhood such as Legos, Playmobile, and  Calico Critters as well as cool new toys.  All kinds of things from educational, to artistic, to just great toys.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, even when it was really busy I had people ask if they could help me find anything.  They also do an amazing job gift-wrapping.

This place is consistently very good.  It isn't the cheapest Mexican restaurant around, but it's also of a higher quality than many.  My favorite dishes are the cheese & onion enchiladas and the spinach enchiladas.  I have never tried anything there I didn't enjoy.    I am really amused by the retro, deep leather booths they have.  They are really comfortable, but sort of strange looking and not necessarily what you would expect to see in a Mexican restaurant.    I am still looking forward to the visit where I save room for dessert!

The Xtreme Bean has a really fun atmosphere and I enjoy going their to hang out with friends.  Everything I have tried there has been good and not overpriced, but to me that is less important than the fun atmosphere.  It feels like the kind of place people come and randomly meet their next best friend or their true love.  It seems so friendly and calm and fun for some reason.  Probably because, unlike a lot of coffee shops, customers come here to socialize, read or play games rather than to pick up a latte on their way to work during the times I have been their.

I have to admit that this is not my favorite game store in the area.  But that would be like choosing a favorite child.  I love them all.  The owners of this place are really, really cool.  Pattie (Patty?) seems to be on a first name basis with some of my friends who go there more than I do.  I love all the dice on display, and their selection of miniatures, D&D books and games of the less nerdy variety seems excellent.    When I go to game stores however, my drug of choice is Magic the Gathering.  Game Depot sells decks, booster packs and all that and they even run drafts and tournaments from time to time (although I have never gone yet).  My only complaint about this store is that they don't sell cards individually.  I know it is a logistics nightmare, and not the main focus of their business, but I want cards to dig through!    They also have a large, inviting room for gamers to do their thing.  There has always been room available when my friends and I go to play there, and it's a great environment.  I always love going to the Game Depot.  It really makes me feel good to support entrepreneurs who care so much about their business, clients and community and are so amazingly nice.

Me and my mom had tattoos done by Jason of this tattoo parlor.  It was done in Idaho at a tattoo expo, not this location.  Jason did an amazing job designing artwork (a flamingo) from scratch, and the tattoos are flawless.  He didn't have the greatest attitude, and was sort of rude for a while so we almost left, but we didn't and I am glad because he did an amazing job!

This place is so much fun!  It is the right combination of greasy spoon and quality, filled with what look to be regulars hanging out.  It is located right on the Chandler Municipal Airport, watching little airplanes is super fun.  Breakfasts seem pretty standard, delicious and not remarkably healthy.    When I came back for lunch yesterday, I was astounded to discover one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had.  This was the last place I would have expected to find a veggie burger, much less a really, really good one.  With think fries and attentive service, this place is fun and delicious!  The fact that I go there anytime my boyfriend is up for it and it's about a 30 minute drive from home is indicative of how awesome it is.

Spinach Enchiladas.    I always go in meaning to try something else, but that has been a losing battle so far.  Although enjoying those enchiladas can hardly be considered losing!  This probably my favorite restaurant in the vicinity of my work.  The atmosphere, service and food are really excellent.  It is a little more expensive than many (particularly Mexican) restaurants, but worth it from time to time.

I came to the Pita House for the free wifi, which is really convenient.  The food is pretty standard, but good.  I especially liked the hummus.  The atmosphere is pretty friendly, the waiters all seemed really nice, and only slightly weirded out that I was on my laptop there!

I went to this Midas yesterday for an oil change because I have yet to find an oil-changer around here I trust.  They initially told me it would take about 45 minutes to get it done.   About 45 minutes later, the guy told me that it was almost done and that my battery and one other critical part needed replaced.  He said the battery was getting 517 CCA and would fail any day.  Being a girl with no car knowledge, I have serious trust issues with mechanics who tell me I must buy NOW, so I got a second opinion.  This morning I took my car to Checker (much better!) to get the battery re-tested.  My battery was fine.  It was getting 100% on the meter.  It most certainly did not need to be replaced.    So I have reason to believe the Midas men tried to mislead me and sell me a battery I don't need, but that wasn't all of the fun I had at Midas.  After I declined to buy $240 of replacements I probably don't actually need, they told me that the oil drain plug (or cap?  I don't actually know) had been previously screwed on too tight and was stripped.  So they needed a replacement.  I drive a Hyundai.  It is not an uncommon car.  It seems strange they wouldn't have a part that I am told commonly needs replaced during an oil change.  They had to call a supplier down the street for the part.  Naturally they didn't call the supplier for maybe 20 to 30 minutes AFTER they had told me they needed to get the part.  I heard the call, I just don't know why they didn't call sooner.    So my 45 minute oil change turned into 2 hours and a scam.  Catch me going back to Midas.

This place is very strange.  The atmosphere is more like a foreign grocery store than a restaurant, but the food is really good.  OK, I have only ever tried one dish but the other food looks really good too!  They have a large selection of unusual salads and the desserts are always really tempting.  They also have sandwiches and pasta.  I keep meaning to go back here, but it is a little out of my way in general.

I really enjoy going here, the owner is really nice and helpful, and since it is a small business he obviously really cares about what he does!  The prices for things I have bought there (mostly magic the gathering cards) are very competitive and he gives a nice bulk discount if you get several.  There is also a binder of rares for competitive prices, and occasional booster drafts.  Additionally, this store sells comic books, shirts and has a really fun and random and HUGE selection of toys and collectibles.  From what I can tell there are both new and old ones and encompass many fandoms.  It is a really fun atmosphere and good prices/selection...  everything I need!

I am asking conscientious consumers who believe in voting with their dollars to boycott this establishment because they tow the cars of paying customers.  A week ago me and three friends met at the IHOP (International  House of Pancakes) on Apache and Forrest.   I left a HUGE tip to make up for the fact that we didn't purchase all that much food, and the waiter was quite nice. When one friend arrived at IHOP, he thought we were meeting by my dorm (which is literally across the street) and walking over, so he parked at IHOP, called us and walked across the street. And in less than 30 seconds walked BACK across the street and into IHOP.  His car was towed WHILE HE WAS INSIDE IHOP. We walked out, couldn't find his car and didn't panic. We knew in our hearts that as PAYING CUSTOMERS, an honest mistake was made and they would take care of us. Nope, not the case. I immediately went back in and asked for the reciept, which the cashier gave me. She was very nice and apologetic and reassuring. As I did that, the one who's car was towed was on the phone with the towing contractor who told him we needed to get a note from IHOP's manager. OK easy enough. So we asked and he began writing the note, and then for whatever reason he called the towing company.  Because the towing company's payed spotter (you know that this towing is lucrative for them if they pay a spotter to look for students) saw him cross the street he refused to write a note saying that we were paying customers.   I still can't believed this happened. We argued with him for a while, started out quite nice but it degenerated. I swear the manager was smiling for most of the time while telling us "there was nothing he could do." Ultimately he lied to us and said it was the responsibility of the hotel because they had contract with the towing company. So far, we have been unable to resolve this in a reasonable way.  It kills me how businesses here treat students. Because there are so many of us, they realize that they can treat us poorly and take advantage of us all over the place, and no matter how many they drive away there will always be more students. I feel really powerless about this, I don't know what I can do to fix it except tell everyone what happened. So I am asking you to PLEASE not go to IHOP while they maintain this policy of abusing students. We can fight back by boycotting them!

This was very disappointing!  We came for breakfast right after they opened up for the morning on a Sunday, and the entire place smelled like cheap cleaning supplies which really did not help my appetite.  The smell was almost overwhelming the whole time we were there.    The service was very good and fast, definitely above average service.  However, the food was mediocre to just bad and it was way overpriced for the quality.  I had a spinach enchilada with beans and rice.  The spinach enchilada tasted good, as things that are 1/2 sour cream can't help but do.  It was low quality, high calorie and not very subtle.    The rice was probably my biggest complaint.  While it had a pleasant orange color, it tasted like...  plain white rice that was a little too old.  Sort of crunchy where it shouldn't be.  The tortillas, salsa and chips tasted like they came  from a grocery store.    So all this would have been just fine if it hadn't cost like $11 each for our breakfasts.  This being Arizona, I have higher standards for Mexican food and this was way too expensive.

This place is a ton of fun, particularly when karaoke is being done.  The first time I came to Carmen's I didn't know it was karaoke until I heard the singing, and I was hesitant about eating with that going on.  I had always thought that people who did karaoke at bars and restaurants sucked really bad.  At Carmen's at least, the singers were really good!  I actually enjoyed listening to them, which I really didn't expect.  Tonight we were actually disappointed that the karaoke didn't start until after we were done.    The food here is so good.  They have huge calzones, delicious pasta and surprisingly delicious salads.  Yum.  The portions are so big that I have yet to try the desserts, but I have high hopes.  The service has also been really superb.  Really friendly people who do their best.  The atmosphere is dimly lit and bar-like, with nice comfy booths.

This place is just ok, which is really not ok for the price range.  The bruschetta appetizer is probably the best part.  I have never had anything there that really blew me away (unless you count the bill at the end).  The house salad is really poor.  I have had better at fast food places.    When I went there the other day the service was really terrible.  Our glasses were all empty for most of the meal, and they seemed to be chatting to the regulars more than actually working.    All this would be fine if it weren't for the price range.  If I am going to shell out $20 per person, I want really good service and better food!

I only have one small experience here so I am a little hesitant to write a review, but I had such a positive experience I couldn't resist!  I was told by a mechanic that I needed a battery replaced right away, but I decided to get a second opinion before giving him my money.  I came to checker to get the battery tested and they said it was fine.  I was greeted by both employees in the front of the store as soon as I came in and got perfect, fast, friendly and professional service.  What more could I want?  I will definitely go back there for all my auto part needs.

This is my favorite Asian restaurant in Tempe!  Also, my boyfriend Mr. Picky Eater likes it too!  They GET tofu.  They have tofu so good that even my non-vegetarian friends order it instead of meat which is fairly unusual.  Every time I try something different (the broccoli dish, the Mongolian, soba noodles... ) I have a new favorite!  The manager seems really cool and attentive.  He really seems to care and that is at least as delicious as the food.

This was disappointing for a number of reasons, some of which may have been outside the control of Los Dos Molinos.    It was built up quite a bit from people who had been there or heard of it.  I was excited since there are not a lot of awesome restaurants that I am aware of in this area.  Maybe the other locations are better, this one was NOT up to much.  It seems like it's trying to get by on being famous for spicy food (not my thing) and kitschy atmosphere.  We tried going by for lunch and couldn't find the door.  I am still not sure if it was closed or not at noon on a Saturday, but it looked deserted.  We tried again later at dinnertime.  The inside area was PACKED.  It was like a third world airport.  A screaming baby and rude party-girl customers didn't help, but the atmosphere inside was cramped and not ok.    We ended up sitting on the patio which was fun and eclectic, but not the most comfortable.  There were benches and things instead of normal chairs and it was lit strangely.  The atmosphere outside was marred by more obnoxious kids and the guy at the table next to us noisily losing his mind over the service quality and other things.  Great entertainment!  The service quality was pretty marginal.  They seemed really short staffed, and we had to wait forever to place orders and then longer than expected for pretty much everything.  They were crowded, but that should not have been short staffed on a Saturday night!    There are warnings that the food there is SPICY and they are not messing around.  The salsa was painful, the options were between too spicy for me and biological weapons.  I ordered a bean burrito, which was not actually spicy.  I forgot what my date ordered, but it was just ok and not particularly spicy either.  As a vegetarian who is spice-averse, there weren't tons of options.  There are so many great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, I don't see coming back here.

This is the best pizza restaurant in the area I have discovered so far!  They have a fairly extensive menu and I keep meaning to go back and try more stuff.  Their standard pizzas are just delicious, many toppings to choose from, tasty sauce, not too thin crust, not terribly expensive.  The calzone was excellent as well!  Delivery is speedy, they appear to have lunch specials and interesting variations on  your typical pizza.  I am a fan!

I adore the atmosphere, food staff and prices here.  I go about once a week and the owners and waiters are like friends now.  They are the nicest, most hard working people and it really shows in the resturaunt.    The food is consistantly amazing.  I never really cared for enchiladas, quesadillas or tamales until I had El Penasco's.  There hasn't been a dish that I have tried there that I haven't loved.  Maybe the best part of the experience is the fresh tortillas and original green, mild salsa.  It comes with chips and red salsa too, but the tortillas and green salsa are amazing.  Above and beyond what can be found in other resturaunts.    They have wonderful service with friendly, effective waiters and chefs, fantastic food and very reasonable prices.  Words cannot say how highly I recommend El Penasco.

Such a fun store!  They have all kinds of gifts like jewelry that I haven't seen other places, and a ton of books!  In my opinion an inordinate amount of floorspace is taken up by hippie/ spiritual/ new age stuff.  The science fiction, fantasy and science sections are somewhat lacking especially as far as used books go.  I do love to go there though for gifts or to buy books for myself!  It is always fun and they do usually have books I want.

An exceptional value!  I have been meaning to try this place for a while, and I am glad I finally got around to it!  I found this restaurant to be a perfect combination of fast food and casual dining.  There are nice, clean tables and a pleasant atmosphere.  Our waiter was very competent and friendly.  The food was not exceptionally high quality, but it was GOOD and it was filling and large.  I ate a falafel pita boat wrap, which was delicious and large for about $4.  This place is perfect for students on a budget, but the food is very good too!

I am a vegetarian and this is my favorite steakhouse.  I am not even kidding, I really like this place.  This place actually has several really good vegetarian options.  I love the grilled cheese sandwich, they make it with excellent bread, different types of cheeses and tomatoes.  It's amazing.  I also had a pasta dish that was really, really good if a little gigantic.  I am always tempted to see if I can just order all the stuff that comes with a steak without the steak.  My boyfriend orders steaks, and the sides are really amazing.  They do vegetables, rolls and everything really well.  I love the onion side thing.

I've been here several times, and it's always been a solid experience but not phenomenal.  We've only had the sushi and appetizers which have always been good.  As a vegetarian, there aren't tons of sushi options on the menu, but they've always been pretty good.

Bookman's is so...  big...  I couldn't even believe it the first time I went there!  I was first mesmerized by all the toys, like Star Trek action figures and random stuff like that, but eventually found my way to the science fiction and fantasy section.  Likewise, it was huge.  They seem to have a lot of books in more narrow categories than you would find at most used book stores, and they also carry non-book items like gifts and video games.   (of which my boyfriend bought several)  This place is so much fun, but far enough away from home that I don't come nearly enough.

This place is open very late at night and I have never seen it without a bunch of people playing various kinds of games in different parts of the store.  I go for the Magic the Gathering Cards, but I believe there is also Dungeons and Dragons and traditional board games as well as LAN games going on, and paraphernalia for more games than you knew existed!  My favorite thing about Gamer's Inn (besides the fact that if it's 11pm and you want to go buy a Disintegrate card you can) is that they have all their MTG cards in neat, organized binders.  It's amazing.  The staff is knowledgeable and can often tell you from memory if they have a card, and where it is.  What convenience!  The prices are a little more expensive than some places (50 cents for commons I think) but I feel that being able to go straight to the cards you want is worth the extra few cents!  They also have expensive rare cards that are hard to find elsewhere.    My other favorite thing about Gamer's Inn is the people who hang out there.  We usually end up learning a ton about MTG strategy and cards talking to other customers there and meet really interesting people.    The prices are a little high, but the convenience of the store and it's variety of merchandise makes up for that I believe.

Every time I come here I get a different experience.  It is never bad, but sometimes it is better than other times.  I normally get a dish with tofu, pineapple and cashews and yesterday the tofu was AMAZING.  Tofu is really hit or miss, so you learn to enjoy the misses if you want to order it a whole lot.  It was a hit yesterday though!  The menu is fairly short, there is only ever one dish that sounds really good to me, but maybe sometime I will try something else.  The most annoying part about Lemon Grass is the drinks.  You receive only a can of soda rather than from a tap.  I am a fatass, greedy American who requires 32 ounces of soda at a meal!

I grew up on fast food just like this!   The milkshakes are perfect.  Different "flavors" mixed in vanilla...  simple and delicious.  I had a butterfingers one which I wholeheartedly enjoyed.    The food selection is not targeted to vegetarians, but that's fine with me since I love onion rings and grilled cheese!  My boyfriends chili fries looked and smelled amazing too...  I was a little envious.  I will definitely hit this place next time I need a shake or some greasy onion rings.  I wouldn't eat in, the tables and atmosphere inside are not that awesome, but take out and drive through work great!

This place is super cool.  I found out about it on yelp as part of a quest to find an independent toy store.  It's tucked away in a strip center behind a Wendy's in Chandler, but totally worth the drive!  I spent way too much on Christmas for my nieces (1 and 7) because there were so many awesome things!  They even had toys I remember from 20 years ago that I had thought would not be around any more.  Really a wide variety of toys from science and educational to arts and crafts to infant stuff.  I am totally going back there whenever I need a gift.  They do free wrapping and have friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff!

This restaurant was friendly, fast, and reasonably priced.  I will definitely be back for more.    We both had the sushi...  The sushi menu had several ingredients that were sort of unusual.  Tomato and mozzeralla come to mind.  I asked for a vegetarian sushi roll other than the basic veggie roll on the menu, and they made me one with avocado, fried tofu, and cream cheese which was fantastic!  Really, really good.  the rolls were all pretty big with great ingredients.  If I can tear myself away from sushi next time I might try the rest of the menu.

My coworkers rave about this place and I finally got to try it this morning.  They were totally correct.  Postino's seems to be all about the wine, about which I am unenthusiastic.  I tried a Mimosa, and our waitress seemed really concerned that I didn't like it.  It was good!    The food is amazing.  The menu is very small and limited, but in a good way.  You know that anything on those few pages is really, really well made with awesome ingredients.  I got the 1/2 veggie panini and  1/2 spinach greens salad.  So good!  I don't know which was better.  We were convinced that our waitress had to be an owner or manager based on her attentiveness, but she said not.  Really great service and food, and what seems to be a major selection of adult beverages.

I used Angel Eyes for several months, but stopped because changing my changing situation made it more practical to do it myself.  The service started out really great, but the quality of cleaning deteriorated over time.  The standard of care fell.  That and they were careless about closing the door so my kitty wouldn't escape.  I was put off at first because they were significantly late without notifying me, after I had to leave work to wait for them.  They weren't awful or overpriced, but wasn't that impressive after the first couple visits.

OK, this is pretty much my new favorite restaurant!  It is right down the street from home, and I have been driving by and meaning to try it for months before last night.  I am so glad I finally tried it!!  My fiancé and I both got the mushroom papparadelle (his with chicken, mine plain) and it was amazing!  Really, really unusually good.  There are several other items on the menu that I am anxious to try.  We were talked into buying a delicious bottle of white wine because part of it went to charity.  Yay good causes and delicious wine!  We had a lovely waitress who talked us into ordering somewhat more booze and desserts than originally intended.  It was super fun and delicious!  The coconut cheesecake was crazy good!  I can't wait to go back to Gasper's, the service and food were both top-notch and it was really a fun place!

This is a really awesome comic/gaming store!  I've been going regularly and will continue to.  I can't really speak to the comic or collectible selection, because I come for the Magic: the Gathering events.  They seem to have all the normal MTG stuff and good prices.  I also like that they have fun drinks like coffee and Italian soda, and T-Shirts and stuff.  I've been to Friday Night Magic events here a few times, which has been really fun.  It's a smaller crowd than at other FNM places.  People here are way less intense too.  More girls, younger people, and newer players.  WAY less intimidating than some other nerd stores I've done it at, notably Gamers Inn.  XD  The staff here is super nice.  They seem to try to remember names and stuff, and go out of their way to make it an awesome experience.  I would highly recommend this place for someone wanting to get into MTG, or play without the really intense players.

This place is fun, filling and delicious!  I like the outdoor/ indoor hybrid sort of space with the fun patio and interesting decor.    Careful ordering - everything is super massive and filling!  I normally get appetizers because I don't eat meat and their vegetarian entree is a little strange for me.  But Windsor's Mac and Cheese is killer as are the other sides I've tried.

Really good food and quick service!  I'll definitely come back.  This area is sort of a dead zone for decent restaurants, so this is definitely one to note.  My favorite thing about this restaurant is that they give you what is presumably the Chinese equivalent of chips and salsa.  They set out a bowl of the little chip-like cracker things.  I am forgetting the name right now.  Wontons maybe?  With that pink sweet and sour type sauce normally served with egg rolls.  So good!  I hope this catches on everywhere, because it is a great idea!!  Both of our meals were HUGE and really, really delicious.  I got the vegetable delight, and my date got the thing with egg chunks.  Both were really, really good!    Service was friendly and very fast.  I'll definitely be back here.
