I took a friend who was visiting from out of town to Saturday brunch and both of us were pleasantly surprised.  The atmosphere is great and the food even better.  I had the Benedict and Enchiladas (Richardsons Combo) and was a bit surprised (in a good way) by the burn of chili peppers.  The smoked pork loin on the Benedict was also noticeable and overall it's probably been one of the best meals I've had in quite a while.

Wednesday: walk into the kitchen and flip on the lights... and nothing.  I check a few things, flip the breakers, even pulled off the plates on the switch and a dead outlet to check for lose wires, no such luck.  I called Dodge Electric on Friday afternoon and scheduled an appointment for 9 AM Monday morning.  9:01 AM Monday morning I meet the electrician and describe the problem to him and he gets to work.  9:40 AM, he finds a loose neutral wire in a smoke detector on a wall that's in no apparent way connected to the room without power.  9:41 AM I have lights in my kitchen and a slightly dumbfounded look my face.  Summary: The electrician from Dodge Electric was punctual, friendly, knowledgeable, quick and efficient.  The price for the repair was also very reasonable.

Not quite the insult to Mexican food that taco bell is... but also not as good as taco bell once you accept that you aren't eating Mexican food.

I went in late on a Sunday afternoon with shoulder pain that was severe enough to warrant an immediate trip to a doctor. After looking on yelp to see what was in my area, I made a visit to Alliance Urgent Care and I'm glad I did. After a very reasonable wait for a late Sunday walk-in, I saw Dr. Dale Schuerman, and found him to be very pleasant and attentive to my needs. If I am ever in need of an urgent care facility again, this will be the place I will visit.
