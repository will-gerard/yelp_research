Audrey is my girl!! She cuts me some great hair and paints it even prettier. I am so picky with high expectations for my locks and I'm never let down at this salon. I like to play around and try different colors/styles and I love that Audrey can keep up with that and always makes me look great. I live down in Tempe and I drive all the way up North because she is so worth it. You will not be disappointed here!!!

I have been coming to First Class Auto for YEARS and  wouldn't go anywhere else! Ray (the owner -- he's always there) is HONEST, FAIRLY PRICED, and knows what he is doing. My entire family now uses Ray because of how great he is. It's hard to find a mechanic you can TRUST, and I've certainly found that at First Class Auto. Ray doesn't nickel and dime you, and only charges for what actually needs to be done, for a good price. I have saved so much money by using his shop for my car needs and I am so thankful. I can't tell you how many times I've brought in my car for something simple, like an oil change, and he'll replace my blinker bulb if its out, FOR FREE!! I have a BMW and if I took it anywhere else, they would charge almost $100 just for the labor on that! And Ray does it for free; doesn't even mention it... Amazing. That is the kind of guy who runs this shop. You've got to give them a try. You won't be disappointed.

I love Old Navy but every time I come to this location I have to stand in line for 15 minutes at LEAST! I don't understand why it always takes soooooo long. They never have enough cashiers working the registers, so annoying. Get it together, people. Its's 11AM on a Monday and there are 10 people just standing here waiting and the people working are completely apathetic to it all. Think I'll start shopping online more. :/

I am in love! And it's right around the corner from my house! So that means it was meant to be. Try the lentil soup... You can't even handle how good it is, trust me.

I have been getting laser from Simplicity for almost a year now and I am very happy with my results. The customer service is great, I love the email appointment confirmations they send you - very useful and convenient. The Scottsdale salon is a nice new office. The staff is friendly. They have great deals. My hair is going away nicely. I'm very happy!

This is by far the best Pho place in the valley. My husband and I used to eat here at least once a week until we moved out to Gilbert. Now we go whenever we are in the area.   The ingredients are fresh. The broth has the BEST flavor. Great portion sizes, and you can't beat the price! The restaurant is always exceptionally clean and the staff is friendly and quick. You definitely won't be disappointed with this restaurant and I would be surprised if you don't get totally hooked like I did.  And if you're not into Pho, their Pad Thai is really good too and I swear they have the best Fried Rice I've ever had!

Been here twice now and each time was a great experience.  First I had the Yellow Curry (level 4 spice) and then I tried the Pad Thai (level 3 spice). Each time I inhaled my food and didn't want to stop when I was full.    My husband had the Drunken Noodles the first time we went and then the Crab Fried Rice. He loved both of his dishes as well.  I also highly recommend the lettuce wraps!! Sooooo soooo good.  The first time we went our server was a little slow - especially when it came time to bring us our check (why do I hate waiting for my check so much?). But the second time we had someone else who was much more attentive and redeemed the restaurant for us.   We will definitely go back. It's great food and a great atmosphere.

I love this place. My husband and I come here all the time. So many flavors and they are ALL delicious. You can sample anything you want so you know which one you want to buy, (try the Monster Mash!). Cute place to go with the family or for a date night. I'm sure in the summer this place will be extra booming with the Arizona heat and people wanting a refreshing treat.   I highly recommend this place. And the owner is such a nice guy. The employees are all very friendly as well. 5 stars from me! Can't get enough!!

I absolutely adore Cafe Rio's food but this location is incredibly SLOW! Even during low traffic hours when there are maybe 2 people in front of you it will surprise you how long it takes to get through the line and pay for your meal.  It's incredibly frustrating. Sometimes after I'm finally sitting down eating, I'll watch others go through the line and am entertained at how long it takes them to make it through the checkout process. Almost makes me feel better knowing it doesn't just happen to me.  Aside from that complaint, I highly recommend the Sweet Barbacoa Salad. It really is to die for.
