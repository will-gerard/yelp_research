Awesome!  Growing up in Scottsdale, I never went to the botanical gardens. I mean come on, what's there to do there? It's not the same as going to the zoo.  But now, it's a must. Go around dusk or check out their website for one of their events. The Chihuly Exhibit was pretty cool last year. And that's what I like, they're more than just a bunch of cacti.   Bring a camera.

A trendy spot to hit up. I am not a big fan of wine, but gave in to coming here with my friend that loves wine. I hear there is a $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine on Mondays and Tuesday. Well last night (Monday) we got the $13 bruschetta (with 4 pieces you choose) and a $30 bottle of Grayson, a cab, all for $20. I mean what a deal.  Dark atmosphere, good food, good variety of wine. Definitely a great local business to support. Parking is probably the biggest problem you'll encounter.  Oh and they have a "People Love Us On Yelp Sticker"!

It's a grocery store, so you already know what to expect.  My review is for the florist. I walked in to buy some flowers, no clue what I wanted. The nice woman approached me, shared their flower selections, asked some good qualifying questions. And when i decided to get two sets of flowers, she made a nice bouquet out of them, some ribbon. I was quite satisfied, great customer service.

A local favorite sushi place of mine. As are all their locations. Nothing can beat their happy hour and the red lights hanging from the ceiling give it a dark cozy atmosphere. I would recommend the Mango Margarita off the happy hour menu as a good choice. Great date place.

I've been coming to this location for about 10 years. The margaritas are some of the best I've had anywhere, frozen or on the rocks. I typically order the flautas, tostadas, or tacos and have never been disappointed.   Its a nice family place to go for good food, and a place to catch up.

I've been here mainly to use their conference facilities for work. So I will not be critiquing their rooms.... But if you're looking for a place to hold an event this would be a great place. And Sangria's is always busy with people enjoying happy hour and pool.  They are attentive to detail and if your boss asks you for last minute miracles, their staff is great at making it happen.

"A Good Place To Day Drink" as their motto goes, and never look back.  A popular destination for locals and visitors for spring training games, you'll always find the place crowded. The place is mostly outdoors so not the best place in a rain storm. The giant game of Jenga, made with 2 by 4 pieces of wood is very entertaining with drunk people playing. The food is pretty good. The nachos always hit the spot especially after you've been drinking. It's not the classiest place in Scottsdale, but its a good place to go and have fun with your friends.  Dos Gringos is always part of the Scottsdale Block Party during New Years, so when that time of the year comes around, it is an affordable and fun choice.

It's a dive bar plain and simple. You can't hide it, and if you go there, you better be expecting to embrace it.  I've been twice in the last week, the first times in all my years of Scottsdale bars. My friends are regulars and they know the staff by name.   Monday night they have karaoke. Get drunk and sing like no one is watching! I hear they have a skull shaped bottle of vodka and the person that orders the last shot out of it gets to keep the bottle. That's per my friends that every vodka drink order try to win it. But sometimes it's the simple things in life that make us the happiest.

I love bowling. Unfortunately I don't go often enough to get better than an average 110 score. Out of the several dozen bowling alleys I have been to, this one is among the nicest.   My best advice is to call in advance and see what's going on. You don't want to show up during a bowling league and not get a lane (ya I've come here because I was in a league). And you don't want to show up 30 minutes before the cosmic bowling starts and have to wait (as I did last night, thinking it started at 9 pm but really not till 10 pm).  The servers that come down to the lanes have always been nice, attentive and on-top of your order. If you're in the bar area it's a bit more laid back and you have to flag the bartender if you need anything.  I like that you get one ball handed to you (of course you can swap it with another). But you don't have to worry about 30 racks of bowling balls and having too many in the ball return.

I can't say I have ever been to Drift other than late at night. It is usually pretty packed and the drinks aren't horribly overpriced.   I found one weekend, when I went two nights in a row, the doorman remembered me from the first night, and didn't card me, makes you feel important.  The decor is Polynesian with a giant fish tank behind the bar. The layout at times can be a bit frustrating when you're trying to move around, or find the bathroom and its crowded. The table area is relaxing to sit down, and the cocktail waitresses are quick to serve you.  I'd recommend it for groups and a good place to end your night. There are plenty of taxis to catch, but after 2am there are so many people outside, finding an empty one can take 20+ minutes.  Oh and the music is pretty good, and the DJ takes requests.

I found a full service gas station! Growing up in Arizona, I know this is not a common thing to find here. I only needed a few gallons to keep me from empty, but the attendants were still willing to offer me their best service. They pumped my gas for me, and washed the windows, and rang up my card, all while I sat in my vehicle.   Be prepared to pay a little extra per gallon of gas, but it is well worth it for the convienence. I bet during the 110+ degree Arizona summers they are quite busy helping people stay in their vehicles.  Located next to the AJ's Fine Foods at the corner of Lincoln and Scottsdale (look for the Sinclair's logo sign). I saw signs that they provide other services besides gas, but I can only speak for my experience.

Really disappointed in the experience I had tonight. I come here often and happened to be driving by with a car full of people. It was 11:55 PM, was not sure if they were open, but the OPEN neon sign was on. As I was turning in off the road, saw a car at the drive thru ordering. Two very good signs they were open. And yes we verified the time on our cellphones.  Pulled up to the speaker and was refused service because the computer locks at midnight. I've worked a POS system before and it does not refuse service especially when it wasn't even midnight yet. When questioned, the employee was incredible rude to us. But of course the car in front of us got service.  Extremely disappointed. Lesson: don't go here after 11 PM there computers might be "locked". I will not be bringing my business back here.

Horribly cliche, but you can tell your parents you're going to The Library on Friday night. I grew up with stories from my dad telling me he told his parents that.  I was hesitant to come here the first time, not always hearing the best of the things. The place is a little oddly shaped and watching a bachelor be embarrassed on the bar top left me more hesitant.   But then, the music started. My friends and I quickly made friends with the DJs on the dance floor. On Thursdays, I believe they have a live cover band playing. The only Thursday I swung in here, they sounded pretty darn good. On Saturdays, they play a mix of hip hop and rap (late 90's through current) and techno dance music.  I'd recommend this place as a legitimate stop. The drinks are good and the waitresses/bartenders are attentive and kind. A good place to meet and hangout without any of the hype or expensive drinks you'll find at some of the surrounding Mill late night stops. Give it a try if you've never been, or make it a stop on your next Bar Golf Night.

It seems like everytime I come here I see someone I know who I never see anymore. A good sign that this place is a popular watering hole on Mill.  I'll say my only negative at the beginning here: I'm not a huge fan of the long narrow space. When crowded it is extremely difficult to weave through the bar height tables to get to the restrooms.  That being said, I'd recommend this as a stop on your bar golf experience down mill. The drinks are pretty average, with good decor and flat screens on the walls. I see this place as more of a late night destination than a pool hall on weekend nights. The outdoor patio is tiny, which is fine with me as I don't smoke.  Overall, I haven't had a negative experience here yet, mainly why I'm giving it 4 stars as its a nice place to come with friends.

I've been coming to the different Oregano's locations for years now. The food here is delicious! I'd recommend the pizza cookie, angel hair pasta, spinach artichoke dip, etc. The atmosphere and decor give the place a great feel and the old music and black 'n' white 50's movies are awesome. Their specialty drinks are strong, which is good, but might be too sweet for some.  I'd recommend this place for groups or a date. Friendly service from the hostess to servers.  Plus they have fun sayings on their shirts, which you can buy, like "Wanna Pizza Me". Think about it.  Take note:  --The parking lot is small, typical of most Oregano's locations, and be careful where you park around so you are not towed.  --They do NOT take reservations, the wait can sometimes be long during lunch and dinner hours.  --The only food criticism I have is of their baked sandwiches; the outer bread crust can be very hard making it difficult to eat and bite into.

This place is always fun and the drinks are pretty good. If you love singing along then this is your place. The pianos are always going, and for the right price, you can always request a song. I think the fact that it's in the basement is awesome; I mean 4 places to go out at, all stacked on four floors. You don't find that in Phoenix anywhere to my knowledge.  If you're going on a weekend night (Thurs-Sat) be prepared to get here early. It fills up fast, despite the cover, and finding tables is difficult regardless of your party size. There are bars at the entrance, and another on the far side (lowest level) next to the stage. Plenty of servers around to help.  Just come prepared to have a good time, some cash for cover, and early if you want to get a table.

Great potential, badly executed.  I came here for Taco Tuesdays... awesome prices. $1 for beef, chicken, pork tacos, $2 for steak, mahi, and crispy fish tacos. $2 domestic and imported drafts, $3 margaritas and Sauza shots.  Horrible service. Not my first time here, but on this instance I had to wait 30 minutes to order a drink and tacos. And 15 minutes after that I had to ask my waitress where my drink was.  Frustrating. Good margaritas tho.

I like whiskey. I showed up before 11 pm, paid the $5 cover for hip-hop night (a Friday) because inside they have $1 well drinks. Honestly, how are you out of whiskey that early in the night.  Needless to say I was forced to drink vodka. I'm not all that friendly when drunk on vodka.  The place is okay to watch games. I've never gotten friendly service, more of a disdained treatment. I'll probably still come here when my friends bring me along. But there are better sports bars in the area.  The only time I can recommend coming here is for New Year's Eve when they have a block party on the street with live music and  with the two bars across the street.

A fun place to go! There aren't many mini golf courses around the area (at least that I know of) and while this place is a little dated, its still a great place to come.  I always see people out at the driving range. The attractions are bit corny but still near and dear to the heart.  I does need some TLC, but you can still have a ton of fun here. Check out their website cause they always have 2-for-1 coupons to print off.

A bit more expensive than your traditional burger restaurant. I really enjoy the variety of burgers mixed with toppings. My favorite is the buffalo burger with muenster cheese, onion ring, and peach BBQ sauce with a light ale on tap. It's a little non traditional in that you order your sides separately and cost almost as much as the burgers. I had the smothered tots, which is basically tater tots and queso drizzled on top.   Located right on Scottsdale Road, it has a good location. Parking can be a bit frustrating as you park behind the restaurant. Good atmosphere overall for a laid back drink.

I didn't know what to expect walking in here. The misspelled name should have been a sign. The place was small and pretty full. The food was pretty good overall, except for over seasoned french fries.  My biggest dislikes were the attire and professionalism of the employees. Seemed a bit inexperienced and undressed for people I want handling my food. The menu was confusing and poorly laid out.  The place had a 50's dinner feel, certainly not a ritzy upper class feel, so charging for sides separate from your burger seemed way over expensive. Maybe if the place looked nicer and the staff dressed nicer I wouldn't mind paying so much. You can choose coleslaw or side salad. The coleslaw comes in a tiny little dressing cup vs. the side salad on a nice size plate. Thankfully I ordered the side salad, but if I hadn't I'd complain about those serving proportions.   The place seems good for kids as they were running about.

I ended up here randomly one weeknight for dinner. My friend and I were seated at the sushi bar. I don't expect the best service at the bar, but it was almost impossible to order a drink.  The decor was nice, but the sushi was overpriced and you didn't get a lot for what you paid for.   My biggest complaint was the sushi bar itself. It was too high and had tin foil blocking the display glass. I mean what is the point of sitting at the sushi bar if you can't see the sushi chef making the sushi.   I haven't eaten in the main part of the restaurant, but I would not recommend the sushi bar.

Perfect walking distance in Old Town.  Overall, a unique sushi place. They have a lot of fun names for their sushi rolls and a lot are spicy. Great for some people, and not for others. The whole happy hour all the time is a bit ridiculous. Prices aren't cheap even with their 24/7 happy hour.  Good place to drink and get sushi, though you will find better places for better prices in Old Town.

I'll be generous with my rating as I rarely visit. I always enjoy Junkie, but I attribute it more to who I am with than the bar.  If you're looking for your muscular deep-V spray tan Scottsdale dbag or your platinum blonde post college sorority girl, than make this a stop.  Girls can spin the wheel atop the bar and do some embarrassing act that they wouldn't do sober. The dance floor would be great if they didn't try to squeeze in tables for bottle service. They do play typical club music, which I enjoy. The bartenders are aloof and pander to their friends and hot girls.  Overall, add it to the list of pretentious Scottsdale bars/clubs that you inevitably go to occasionally  because one of your friends is in the mood.

If you live in the area, you must experience this.  A paved pedestrian/bicycle path that follows along Hayden Road as it winds it way by several parks, man made lakes, golf courses, and schools. A lot of local condos and houses have easy access to it. Pre and Post work hours you'll find quite a few people out walking, roller skating, biking, walking their dogs, fishing, jogging, ultimate frisbee and the usual park things. Did I forget any?  If you know where you're going it can take you anywhere in the Scottsdale area. Below is a list of possible places you can get to from it (and I know I go cycling up and down it):  If you have any questions about biking or hiking around Scottsdale, feel free to message me. I am a big supporter of the Greenbelt!

THE MUSIC IS LOUD!! Which is freaking awesome. The only time I have ever been here was for the Armin Van Buuren concert. And when you go to see one of the best DJs in the world playing Trance music, you want the music loud!  It was small, dark, and with 300+ people inside the place was packed so you could barely move. Appropriate for the concert and type of music playing. I can't comment on the place for an average night, but given the right event, you could have an awesome time here.  It's worth checking out and seeing if its your type of place in the Scottsdale Nightlife circuit.

Over the last couple of years, I've had a couple different stylists here. I can only say great things about my stylist, Emi. She's great at being on time and usually is finishing her last appointment as I arrive. Of course, if she's 5 minutes late, I can enjoy a complimentary beer or glass of wine and browse the internet on a laptop.  The actual haircut is what I ask for, and Emi is always willing to listen to my particular requests. The scalp massage is always an added bonus when they wash your hair. Overall, I keep going back because of the great service I have received thus far.  My only complaint is the owner stopped offering you a discount for booking your future appointment at your current one.

The food here was delicious. The decor is pretty fancy and typical of Old Town Scottsdale. I'd recommend sitting outdoors if the weather accommodates.   I had the Soft Pretzel appetizer and the Grilled Cheese sliders. Highly recommened. I hear they have live music on the weekends, so I will have to return to check it out. Definitely a good place to stop on your tour of Scottsdale restaurants fellow Yelpers.

I've been here many times during the week and i've always gotten fast service. Occasionally you have to wait a few minutes, but you can see that the employees busy their butt to fill your order. I'd always have to recommend the Caribbean Passion and a blueberry muffin. Great morning starts.

I was here the other weekend and would highly recommend it. It is basically the same layout as the old bar that was there (DrinX) but is a much trendier spot now.  The drinks are reasonably priced for Scottsdale and they play good music. Its usually crowded so its not a place to dance, but similar to Coyote Ugly, the bartenders get on the bar but instead of a routine on the bar, they dance on poles.  If you're able to find a seat or booth claim it and keep it. Despite the crowd I don't usually see a long line (and if there is it moves fast).

I came here the other day with a friend for happy hour. For a drink and an appetizer off the Happy Hour Menu, we each paid $10 plus tip. The food was delicious. I haven't fully explored the menu yet but I'd recommend the Chicken Lollipops (ya I said that right) or the Animal Fries. Also they're specialty cocktails come with double shots, so you get your money's worth (at $13 a pop), but during happy hour they are half off too.  The atmosphere is pretty fun, with all the serves wearing Vans. It has a very modern feel, with lots of exposed metal and lounging areas. The main patio faces Scottsdale Rd, which gives the place a very urban feel, with people walking by. Oh and did I mention it has a second floor?

My review is on the nightlife, though I will have to come back and try the food.  I was here last weekend. I can't say I was ever at Mickey's Hangover, so they are already doing something right.  The hot spot in old town right now. Average prices for Old Town, and good music. I would recommend the back bar as it's faster than the bar closest to the patio, though you will need to navigate through the dance floor.  As the weather gets cooler this will become an even more popular spot. Unlike Revolver, Dirty Pretty, and Junkie, this place has a large and spacious patio and was just as crowded as the inside.  Another good stop on your Old Town bar hopping.

I love Smashboxx and I hate Smashboxx. It is what it is though and I keep going back.   I wish there wasn't a line most of the night that takes an hour. I wish the DJ repeated songs less often (after all most people stay longer than 30 minutes).   The drinks are reasonably priced and you should definitely come in dancing mode. They play mainly hip hop, dance and top 20 with a little house music thrown in. Be prepared for flashing lights,

Opening Night.  Drinks are good. Ya you can get the usual stuff, but the real difference here are the specialty drinks. It's worth the time to order something of the light up bar menus. I can't recall any of the names but I had the bartender make 3 different ones for myself and friends. All good, and the muddled fruit was a great addition to the flavor.  They were giving out roses to women as they entered on opening night, nice touch. The music was low enough you could here the buzz of the entire lounge talking which was pretty unique. I didn't have to yell to talk to my friends. Cocktail waitresses in pink dresses and white pearls, classy and sexy.  All in all, it appears to be a well thought out place. I'll be sure to update this in the future if my opinion changes.

Disorganization is all I can say. The weather sucked. It was hot, but they can't control that. My biggest problem was with the lines. I bought tickets to the event and tequila tent days before the event. Not a single line was properly labeled. Who knew there were two lines because there were no signs! And waiting in lines when its 100 degrees out when you don't have to is stupid.  The tequila tent was great (once I finally got in). Biggest problem was with the lack of communication. The tent closed at 5pm apparently, which was never stated or told to ticket holders. And vendors just closed up early. Don Julio's table was the best. They paired there tequila with fruit chasers.  The tacos and beer were good. The free t-shirts were sweet. I like that it was at the waterfront but the location sucked. Freshly cut dead grass and dirt being stomped on by thousands of people made for a hard time breathing.  All in all I had a good time. Not because the event was amazing, but because I was with fun people. This event is not good for kids giving the amount of drunk people stumbling around.
