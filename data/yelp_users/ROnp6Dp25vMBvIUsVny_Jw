Went here with a bunch of friends tonight. Had to wait 40 min for a table on a Thurs and another hour before we received our food. The tacos were cold and less than par and over priced. Seriously $11 for 3 cold carne asada tacos!!! Obviously the lease on this place is ridiculous to charge those kind of prices. The salsa was watered down and had little flavor. Don't even get me started on the service...let's just say bad, real bad. I wouldn't visit this place again if it was free.

I have had eyelash extensions for about a year now. I absolutely LOVE them and get so many compliments. I go to Jenn for all my esthetic needs. Her facials are out of this world and she uses all organic products. She is hands down the BEST in the business!!
