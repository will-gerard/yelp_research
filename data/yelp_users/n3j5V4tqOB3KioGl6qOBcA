What a disappoinment. I eat chipotle at least 5 days out of the week. Its healthy and delicious. I live in Old town Scottsdale so the location on Scottsdale road is where i always go. But, tonight i happened to be coming back from a friends house closer to this one. Since it was on the way i decided to stop here instead of waiting to be closer to home. MISTAKE. The woman who kept bouncing between the cashier and the food line was rude (btw, clearly the cashier girl didnt know what she was doing..but we'll get to that later). I asked her for a vegetarian salad with the rice on the side...she put it in a portion cup and i told her i was sorry and i prefer it to be placed in a bowl instead  ( i hate the rice all smashed) she proceeded to tell me it was an extra charge. (So to have my rice on the side costs more?! I told her the chipotle by my home never charged me and she said theres nothing she can do. Wow, great customer service. Then i ordered chips and salsa and was charged again for an extra.salsa. it took  while for the cashier girl to even get my order rung up correctly. For someone who eats chipotle sooo much,  you will NEVER see me again at this location. Rude.rude.rude.

This is the consistently slowest Starbucks I've ever been to. Unfortunately, it's right next to my office so I'm forced to make the trip here...about every other day.   I've waited 15 minutes in the drive through, with only 4 cars ahead of me. Then, when I decided it would be faster just to walk inside, boy was I wrong. These baristas need to get it together. A 15 minute wait for coffee is unheard of, especially at Starbucks... And to top it off, it's never even really busy..well, not enough to justify the wait time. Being that this store is so close to my job, I really hope they can make some improvements. I have an extra star because the drinks are usually made well.

Truly a 5 star experience. Iv been to LOTS of nail salons,  probably over 100. This by far is my favorite. Its family owned/operated. The staff speaks English and totally caters to what the customer wants. Special requests are welcomed. Iv been to so many nail, salons that want to charge 5 dollars for this and that and everything in between. You can't beat the prices here and they're work really is quality. Lots of options (tips, crystals, etc). I wish they were in Santa Monica,  but I will definitely be coming here when im in Arizona.  A+ .

Awful service! I used to come her back in 2010 when it was new, the food and staff were awsome! I recently came back and the staff is all new. One word... RUDE. Our waitress seemed pestered when id ask for a refill or when id place another order. Like, um, sorry to bother you at work lady? The food was good, but theres a ton of other sushi places in the east valley with the same grade of food and better service. Its a shame this place shot to shi*, could have been a real gem.

According to these other reviews it seems im not the only one left with an awful experience after leaving this joke of an auto spa. To be brief, got a deluxe wash and a wax on my Mercedes Benz SLK, When my car was finished there was a scrape in my drivers side door where paint had been chipped off! They told me it could be the pressure of the wash and thay they weren't liable. I had zero compensation and I can't begin to express how rude the staff was. They left no air freshner in my car and it was a half ass over all job to top it off. Never, ever go here with a car you value or you may end up with scratches and peels...and remember, they aren't liable for damage. Unbelivable.

The florist here is very sweet. She made me a custom "princess" bouquet for my daughters 6th birthday with 2 dozen dark and light pink roses, added butterflies and baby's breath. She loved it!

Easily my least favorite Whole Foods in the valley. It's about half the size of the others (chandler and north Scottsdale). Since they sacrificed size, along came the sacrifice of those little whole foods in-store restaurants I love so much, like the smokehouse BBQ, pizzeria, and fresh sandwich shop. Still, not a bad store to pop into for some light shopping. But, I much prefer to take the extra 8 minute drive to the bigger - and better, sister stores.

I've been a member at Lifetime for about 6 months and I LOVE IT (mostly). The only flaw people might find is the membership pricing can be quite steep. Other than that, it's amazing. The amenities here make lifetime a one-stop-shop. The first floor offers a hair and nail salon for both men and women, LifeTime Cafe with blended smoothies, supplements, pizzas, etc. Additionally, basketball courts, indoor and outdoor pools, and a daycare center can all be found on the first level. When you go up the stairs, you'll be greeted by a massive open floor plan that houses every exercise machine you could imagine. If you decide to embark on a personal training journey, see Germaine. He is amazing!

Let's just say, if "my sisters closet" had a basement, I would live there.   This location is in a wealthier area, therefore it gets a lot of really awesome designer wear in pretty good condition..for a GREAT price. I bought a YSL silk a-line skirt (25.00), a vintage Chanel dress in mint condition (400.00) and a killer Louis Vuitton purse (590.00) and duffle bag (850.00).   If you are designer savvy, you know that's practically stealing! The thing is, when something good comes in here, it goes...FAST. So you have to jump on the good stuff, but don't worry, it's plentiful here.

Khaled (the owner) at the front desk was able to fit me in on a Saturday within ten minutes for an oil change. I was quoted 80.00 for my Audi which is a pretty good deal when dealing with synthetic oil, a few other places I called were estimating a 100/120 bill. They also took notice to a much more serious problem with my sway bars. I had previously noticed sounds but until they showed me how bad the damage was under the car, I had no idea what a danger hazard I was placing myself in. There is a small waiting room that offers keurig coffee, water, and seating. There are a few neighboring restaurants if you want to kill some time and are expecting a longer service wait time. I never felt like a was being thrown a sales pitch either which is rare when dealing with mechanics. They gave me the information, recommendations, and let me make a decision best for me. Overall...quick service, affordable pricing, and friendly non-pushy staff. Would return.

Typical late night greasy pizza. Not great, not bad. But, it is open 24hrs which is why it gets 4 stars (delivery as well). And hey, when your leaving the club at 2 am drunk....who needs gourmet food anyways? Garlic knots are worth a try and the pepperoni pizza is pretty ok too. Id keep your toppings simple seeing as the ingredients may not be the most fresh. I order late night from Gus's quite often and for an after hour spot, the delivery wait isn't too shabby either.

This location is great because it's centrally located, they use sugar and carb free syrups, and it's very spacious and organized, and the staff has always been friendly. Whether you're a bodybuilder or someone looking for a healthy meal alternative, this location will have what you need. Creatine, glutamine, whey protein, protein bars and smoothies. They also offer a punchcard, your 10th smoothie is free.

Poor selection of lingerie. Dancer shoes from the 80's. Wayy over priced dancer wear. Fascinations adult store down the street blows this place out of the water. They do sell other things such as bongs and porno although the smoke product prices are inflated as well. Would not recommend.

This store is just, vintage paradise. They specialize in Levi's but have a pretty wide selection of band shirts/other random items. I picked up an 80s guns & roses shirt that was cut into a halter and tied at the back. So cute, received a few compliments from others. I'll defiantly be back when I have more time to browse. Lots of hidden treasures here.

Im actually pretty impressed with this place. I didnt feel like driving down to my usual spot and this was a bit cheaper. one of the better chicken kabobs iv ever had. Juicy, tender,  and seasoned really well. I also ordered a fatoush salad. Its a big portion...a little too much dressing,  but good. Since I checked in on yelp I got a free sandwich as well. Theres a small middle eastern market attached with zam zam, falafel, etc... overall,  I really enjoyed my food and will be back again.

Scottsdale Ocean Club never disappoints. Whether entertaining clients, or family and friends..everyone is sure to leave happy. The food is perfection and the service is immaculate. Also, the area has great surrounding shopping. OC is located in Keirland and across the street is the quarter.   AND PLEASE TRY THE BUTTER CAKE.

Very unhelpful and rude. I sat down with Francisco Ramirez to go over details of my account. I didn't have a debit card so he asked for two forms of ID. I handed him two STATE issued IDs and he said that would not work (iv never heard of that) it was an Arizona ID and my state drivers license. I has to go to my car and get my business license. After that he was rushed and very short and rude and my problem wasn't resolved. He just told me to call the number on the back of my card for better luck. Never coming back to this branch again.

This location is far bigger (and better) than the Tempe location. The hot bar is awesome and so is the food selection. I come here to get GMO-free and organic produce and meats. The butcher section is great. Tons of meat options you wouldn't find at traditional grocery stores. I bought their bison ribs for an Easter BBQ and they were a huge hit with the whole family. Also, they have a HUGE cheese selection for those who love to cook. Whatever cheese you need, you can find it here. There is also a wine connoisseur if your interested in pairing.

Iv been to all of Mastros restaurants now, and none have ever left me dissatisfied. Its what you would expect, nothing more, nothing less. Although the loud music can be a tad overpowering at times, you can always request seating away from the noise if your coming for a more intimate date. The bar is nice for a more casual setting. Drinks are always delicious, as is the food (no matter what you order). This may be a steak house but all of the options on the menu are equally impressive. Never tried their desserts (far too much of an indulgence for me)...but, rumor has it they'll just melt in your mouth. Personally, i would recommend the fish special.

Since theres no whole foods in the area, I settled for this nearby Sprouts. One word, outdated. How can a new store be outdated you ask? 1. Returns aren't computerized. They literally write a paragraph on a note pad, have you give a million signatures, IDs, more signatures etc. (I was returning a.duplicate bottle of chardonnay I accidentally purchased guys,  not 234 fillet mignons!) Before the return process began,  the cashier girl had to call a supervisor,  who then proceeded to make a bunch more calls to see if they were allowed to return alcohol. Lets get a little staff knowledge,  please. I do have a life and a schedule and would prefer not to spend and hour making a 40.00 return. If I would have known how this experience would have.gone down, I would have kept the bottle and called it a day.

As a hookah frequent, I have to say Harem has to be the biggest waste of money iv ever spent at a hookah lounge.  The other reviews are pretty accurate. The wait staff sucks, oh wait...there's only ONE employee ever working (if that qualifies as a wait staff). The hookah is always too harsh. The quality of shisha is nothing to write home about. ONE hookah and two waters totalled 35.00 !!! & when I handedn the cashier 40.00 in 20 dollar bills he asked me if I had exact change because he had no twenties or ones. Like I stated before,  waste of $$$. It only gets one star because the decor is cute. But then again, id rather sit in a basic lounge with good shisha and fair prices. Fail.

Finally getting around to reviewing this gem. Overall, excellent food and excellent service. I'm really big on eating healthy and this place has healthy foods that taste absolutely delicious. (Please try the bison burger). The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because on one occasion the red chile shrimp came out missing an ingredient and tasted bad, although, it was taken off the bill. Secondly, I strolled in after the gym for a lunch time meal and they shut down food production for a kitchen malfunction. But in the scheme of things, I love true foods and its concept. They have really nailed delicious healthy food on the head and even my boyfriend who is a meat and potato kind of guy loves coming here anytime.

I wanted to fall in love with this place, I really did. Unfortunately, I found the food to be seemingly inadequate. I ordered the guacamole as an appetizer, and it was....okay. I mean, it was good, but nowhere near the pedestal people have placed it on. For my entree, I settled for tacos. Weirdly, I found them to be bland. The ambience was lovely and romantic, although a bit noisy. Overall, I'm too lazy an individual to make concerted efforts so as to try a restaurant the second time after it has disappointed me the first..so I will not be returning.

I love this place. Do note, The key is knowing what to order. The chicken fajitas are shockingly good. The chicken is consistently juicy and packed with flavor. I'm also a huge fan of their guacamole and salsa selection.   P.S. Don't order the salmon, it's terribly blasé.

I was really bothered by this practice. I've been a patient here for a little over a year now and came in to have annual blood work done. The physician came in, asked the standard questions...then proceeded to tell me I smell like marijuana with an attitude. I found that to be extremely bold considering I'm an Arizona State issued medical patient who suffers from chronic pain due to a chest injury from 2011. This isn't 2005 anymore and patients shouldn't be judged if they choose to use legal holistic healing methods instead of being a slave to pharmaceuticals. She made me extremely uncomfortable and the entire appointment felt weird. That being said, I will be looking elsewhere for my healthcare needs.

Ok, so iv been a Starbucks junkie for years....until i discovered dutch bros! This location is my favorite, although they are all good. My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free. You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks. You cant beat their customer service either, all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat, always greeted with a smile! I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new one..they exchanged my drink, apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge. added bonus is the stamp cards, so if your an avid coffee drinker like me, you'll be saving some money to. Quick drive-through for on the go.

Bad. I had to take my car to get fixed and my new puppy needed food, so I called clean air cab to take me to pet co. I was quoted 25 minutes maximum and 30 minutes later I called back to see where my can was because it hadn't arrived nor did I get a call with an ETA. The person I spoke with said they would have the driver contact me. I called back again because I hadn't recieved a call. The girl on the phone told me the driver tried to call and since I didn't answer he left. I had no missed calls and when I asked them to verify my number to see if my contact information was correct, it was all right. Hmm? So I asked another cab to be sent out and got quoted another 30 minutes. This is not the first time this has happened either. I only use clean air because they're cheap, but if you need to be somewhere on time, stick to discount cab, they're pretty realiable and the fare is decent. You'll save yourself a lot of hassle.

I came in for a service on my car and voiced some issues I had with the manager. I was pleasantly surprised at his determination for me to leave is a happy customer. There's nothing better than a company who values their customers. I appreciate good customer service as I'm sure everyone else does especially when it comes to dealing with our vehicles. The manager went out of his way to assure my concerns were taken care of in every way.

One of a kind training studio.   I have been a client to a fair amount of gyms and training studios over the years and Spartan Training is amongst the best.  The staff are actually knowledgable about the human body and how to get results pertaining to each individual clients needs. There are people of all different shapes and sizes working out here and the atmosphere is upbeat, positive, and professional. They don't cheat you of any time and don't waste half your session stretching (but do make sure you come stretched to avoid injury). It is even encouraged you stay after your hour to hit the cardio machines which are available for your use anytime during business hours. Miss a session? Don't worry, there's no charge for no-shows and they are extremely schedule friendly and try to accommodate you at a time that best fits your needs.  Personally, I have always left completely satisfied with my workout and if paired with a clean diet , results here should be easily attained by any client.   Overall, I would recommend Spartan Training to anyone looking to make fitness part of their lifestyle. Whether it be body building or just overall good heath and wellness. A+

Craving Arab food tonight amd this was the closest to my hotel. Beautiful inside, love the decor. Table cloths , cloth red napkins, dim lighting. They played traditional music, not too loud or overpowering. Full bar. Next door to a hookah lounge which is nice. Friendly service. The food was yumm. Over all, I would return.

Stopped in here because I was tired and didn't feel like driving to my favorite spot. It was a hot day and it was equally hot inside. Nail spas are supposed to be where you can relax, not sweat during a pedi. Aside from the warm atmosphere it wasn't busy and I was sat in a chair with hot water promptly. staff is ok...not great,  not bad. The work was decent. Would I return?  No.

Love this location. The service is friendlier than their sister store on Scottsdale Road. They do use sugar in their protein syrups as well which I prefer over the "sugar free" syrups at the other location. Anything real is better than fake in terms of nutrition.

Best urgent care I'v been to. Office is new, spacious, and clean. Also, it's not busy here and they aren't under staffed. The doctors here are great and answered questions that doctors at other urgent cares couldn't. I wasn't rushed and got all the insight i needed on what to do to fix my problem. If you check in you get a free in-house prescription. So my Vicodin was free, awesome.

Facial was good, message was average...although the scented oils were phenomenal smelling, nice key code lockers (what a pain it would have been to keep track of a key during spa day) , cucumber water and trail mix between sessions, breathtaking view. They DO not do acrylic nails :( other than that...lovely, but iv had better. The real gem of the talking stick is the roof top restaurant Orange Sky! Go at night, you will LOVE it!

I'm disappointed to write this review since I have eaten at fuzzys several times over the past couple years. This is a delivery/food quality review. On 5/15/14 I placed an order for delivery for nachos, two chicken tacos, chips & salsa, and rice & black beans at 5:16 pm. An hour later and still no food. I called the manager and she told me the food was finished and waiting to be delivered. 45 minutes passed and finally the food arrives ( so my food was sitting for 30 minutes before being taken to be dropped off) yuck. The food arrives and the nachos are luke warm and extremely soggy. Immediately tossed in the garbage. The chips had not been seasoned like listed in the online description. The tortilla from our tacos fell apart from absorbing so much moisture and they were luke warm as well. I called back and the manager said "sometime that happens with delivery" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? She offered no kind of apology or compensation. Just unbelievable. After tossing the rest of the food, my boyfriend and I both agreed Taco Bell would have been a tastier route instead of wasting 40 bucks on the half-assed soggy concoctions we received. Never ordering from here again. If your in the south Scottsdale/Tempe area "El Molinos" is a more reliable option for delivery Mexican.

Ok so I've been meaning to write a review for this place for a while. Awesome. For the price you deff get your money's worth. It's not like the "5 dollar little Caesars pizza" that looks and tastes like shit. These pizzas even surpass some of the more expensive spots in the area. The crust is good and the toppings taste fresh. I would recommend.

As a newly found vegan, iv taken it upon myself to seek out the best spots in the valley for tasty (and of course vegan friendly) dishes. Where others lack, Desert Root makes up. They have a range of foods to choose from; multiple flavors of hummus, tasty veg creations, quinoas, and for those with a sweet tooth, pies and cookies as well. The menu is ever changing and all made from scratch. Inside you'll see an open, clean kitchen full of fresh veggies and did I mention, CLEAN. This place got the 5th star for customer service. The staff is all welcoming and helpful. Aren't sure what to order? Don't worry, they offer samples of whatever you'd like to ensure a happy order. Im very much so looking forward to my next dining experience here.   *note: only outdoor seating is offered*

Look no further.   Michael is a great lawyer who CARES about his clients. He isn't just out to grab your money and half-ass your case. Michael is now helping me on my second case and has made himself available on his personal cell phone whenever I had questions or concerns. There is nothing worse than reaching a desk phone voicemail in times of crisis or concern. He even took the time to discuss details with me while he was attending to his own family matters. You can't put a price on that kind of service. He's very knowledgable and reliable.   Don't waste your funds (or freedom) on money shark attorneys who take no personal pride in your case.

Im not impressed with this new location at all, I guess disappointed would be the right word. Its in a nice area of Chandler with many new buildings going up so I had high hopes entering this store. Its beautiful inside. Spacious with "newer" more modern decor. Although the wait staff is nothing short of unskilled and unprofessional. THREE out of the four times i came the drive through was closed. Whats the point of a drive through if you never use it. I came in at 2pm on a Tuesday. There was one barista ringing in orders and a line of about four people ahead of me. She was one of the slowest cashiers ever, the woman being serviced demanded a gift card for next time due to poor service. When it finally was my turn, I ordered a mocha light frappacino with added whip cream. Thats not being too difficult is it? Apparently to the barista it was. As I waited for my drink the man ahead of me told here she forgot the cream in his coffee and he stood there for about five minutes because she had to "get more half and half" . Ugh. He was visually upset too. Then when my drink was served, it was a coffee frappacino! I told her my order once again and she made me a mocha light frappacino and for got the added whip. Whatever, I give up and leave. Even though this location is convenient...its not worth the headache.

I REALLY wanted to like this place...but an appointment for 2pm and waited around 20 minutes to be serviced. They left my nails in acetone for 30 minutes, severely drying out my fingers while receiving my pedicure. After being in the nail salon for roughly 2 hours, the girl at the front desk chased me out to my car 3 times changing my tab!

Yes, finally! A nail salon with talented artists. My only regret is not having found this gem earlier. I'm very picky with my nails and the staff at Stash went above and beyond. Jimmy got my nails filed to the perfect shape (pic attached) and my pedicure was equally beautiful. This boutique-style salon caters to specialty designs and unique artwork. It was my first time here, so I can't wait to play around with more adventurous ideas on my next visit.   The atmosphere here is unique in itself, very hip and trendy. Stash reminds me of a salon I might see in Manhattan or LA. They play fun music and the walls are adorned with contemporary art. They are located pretty centrally in Phoenix, so it isn't too hard to get to from any location you may be coming from.
