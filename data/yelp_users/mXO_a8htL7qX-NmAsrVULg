The food is dry. The prices are high. Your order is never right. I've gone here twice. I thought the first time could of been a fluke. Take your business just around the corner to bobo's for great food!

I went here on Tuesday witch was cool because it was taco Tuesday... however it took 50 minutes for the food to get to the table and the taco was made with a premade shells you would get at Safeway.

This place is dirty and has a very distinct oder that smells like feet. The food when fresh must taste good but I would not know as everything I had tasted as if it was out all day. On top of that it is expensive... so that's nice. Lol

We have used AZ Elite  several times for bringing us to and from the airport and they are always awesome. Clean cars, always cold bottled waters, professional drivers. They even took us down to Tucson and back to attend a UofA football game and it was an amazing time. Highly recomnended
