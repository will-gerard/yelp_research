I ordered pho. The look of the place was nice. It was clean and the staff were really courteous.  There were a few to go orders in front of mine so I had to wait. It wasn't long and they were polite.  My pho was not really good. I'm sad because I love pho, and I was excited to find a place close to home.  The pho was really disappointing, like I didn't finish it bad. I wish the owners tasted their pho and and another place's pho so they can understand my disappointment. It doesn't matter where they get their pho to test, anyplace is better than this. Maybe canned soup would be more competition.  Do they make canned pho? Maybe that's where they got this.  I'll try them again for something other than pho. Like I said it looks good

This is my favorite 'bux. The staff are really friendly. I have come here for a few years. It gets busy here but these guys are consistent and friendly.  Sometimes I place mobile orders under aliases. They put up with my shenanigans pretty well (see picture)

I have been coming to NYPD since I first moved to Az. I am originally from queens NY. I grew up working in pizzerias. I know a good pie.  This is the best pizza. Johns on bleaker street in the village comes pretty close, but NYPD makes a tight pie.  The other end of the equation is the service. Mat the manager has made a good staff here. Every time I come in he is friendly, and his staff is on point.  I give this place my highest rating.

Really bad service here. The guy who takes your car always goes for the up-sale.  That's ok, but they always promise it will take less than it does. They guy talked me into an interior job, told me it would be 20 minutes total. It's been an hour.  This is my lunch. Everyone else is getting their car. Not me.

I love Kayla!! Smartest trainer I've ever had the luck to know. There's a reason she is a regional manager, she is dynamic with her approach to nutrition, lifestyle and training.  Few doctors associate sub clinical tachycardia with poor sleep, much less trainers. Kayla throws it down. She doesn't meathead load her clients on hyper protein diets and unsupported carb loading. She also doesn't abuse ketosis. She uses lab work and feedback to set her protocols.  If you have the opportunity, train with her or study under her. She is a rare, brilliant gem.

Of all steakhouse experiences, this is the best. I have enjoyed many steaks at Delmonico Steak house. Tonight was perfect.  I enjoyed a New York strip served Piedmontese. My steak was cooked impeccably. Executive Sous Chef Ivan Rojas prepared a meal my wife and I truly appreciated.  We have been customers here for 5 years now.  I was raised in the restaurant industry, and I truly appreciate the effort involved to create our meal.

I really love this place. We had our company christmas dinner there, and numerous dinners among friends. Each time the food was good and service was prompt.

The new look is good. The wait for getting tickets is  bad. Really bad, like you should apologize for how bad it is.  The line isn't really long. And it's not really complicated. But you have made a short line move slow. Super s l o w.   If you are going to complicate the process with added steps, maybe you can improve your capacity at the counter, have a few more employees checking us in.  I mean you pay them what 8.25/hr? Tickets cost $10 or so. You charge $7-8 for popcorn and it costs you .30 to make it. It's not like you can't afford a few more kids at the front desk.  I mean at this point you just look like cheapskates.

I had an awesome door installed in my home. I have received a lot of complements on the door, I will upload a picture if I can. They were courteous, and professional. I made a mistake about the day they were coming to install it, they re-scheduled it without a problem.  I would like to say that they have incredible customer service, I was not an easy client. I recommend them to any of my friends

I have been coming here for years. My family has purchased two vehicles from Chapman. We have also used the service department. David Pence in service has always been helpful.  I couldn't imagine going to a different dealer.

I feel very fortunate to have found dr. Gibbons. Dentist appointments always make me nervous. Walking in to the clinic you see right away the difference.  I feel welcome and at home here. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The facility is professional and tastefully decorated. The equipment used in the course of my care was state of the art.  Dr. Gibbons is one of the most professional dentists I have ever met. His bedside manner is easy and friendly. His work is excellent, as is the work of his support staff.  I highly recommend this office!

I love coming here for dinner and brunch with my family. We have been coming here for 2 years. My daughter loves the breakfast menu, my sons love the hamburgers. My wife and I love the salads and tacos.  The service is great. The bar makes solid cocktails.  I only wish they would change up the menu.

Back at one of our favorite breakfast places. It's packed to the rafters. Even though it's a 45 minute wait, the staff is courteous and the restaurant is running like a well organized business.  The manager or owner is very present. Helping clear tables and seat guests. We normally wouldn't wait this long for a table, but for breakfast here, it's worth it.

The hosts were nice. We were seated within 15 minutes in a Friday night at 645. The table we were given was next to the bathroom. We could hear the toilet flushing, so we asked for a different table.  It took another 15 minutes for a table.  Our server was super prompt and polite. She accommodated a few special diet requests (kids wanted broccoli on the side). Service was prompt.  Food was on time. Appetizers were good.  Pizza came. First, it was luke warm. Second, one of the pies was not what we ordered. Third, the gluten free pizza crust was really bad. The kind of bad that sucks.  The manager fixed the pie mistake and got us a new one fast.  The cheese was still hot and melted which made it the best pie of the trio, but the gluten free crust still really sucked. The kind of suck that fills you with regret for ordering it.  I would eat here again because out server was really great. The hosts fixed the flushing toilet table problem, so that was good, and the manager was on point.  The gluten free crust fills me with regret.  If you are going to make food, make it not suck.

We have been coming here for a while because the sushi is awesome. The service has been good as well. The ambiance is nice with the DJ spinning on the weekends.  We will come back here again.
