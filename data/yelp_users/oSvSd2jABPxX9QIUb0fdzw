Yummmmmmm!!!! :) Best vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix!! Awesome, delicious, flavorful , hearty and vegan!! Definitely a restaurant for food lovers. I thought Green was happening and prior to that I was Fresh Mint addict but this place takes the cake! I haven't eaten in yet because the decor is a bit dated but takeout is fast and fantastic only ever takes 10-15 min to get your order made so perfect spot to grab dinner on the way home. Great prices and large portion sizes! Best vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix!!

Hummus had mold in it. I told the server, and he just asked if I wanted more of the moldy hummus :( The dolmas had no flavor. Tasted like they were soaked in water. So disgusting! The tahini roasted cauliflower was alright but bland.   Though we did have some menu highlights, fresh tabouli and Tzaiki sauce, the food was not fresh and the kids running the restaurant do the bare minimum to "make it right". I doubt they actually make anything in house here. On top of this, the parking lot is a bit of a nightmare to navigate. Needless to say, too many good restaurants to come back to this yucky one. Will definitely pass in the future.   P.S.- Bettina, not sure how to message you through the  Yelp app, but it was definitely not cilantro. It was an overwhelming musty flavor in the hummus that can't be mistaken for anything other than mold.   I told the waiter thinking it was the pita originally. He offerefmd to get me more of the same kind, but I declined. He confirmed that none of the pita was made in-house, but offered to get me some of the other kind of pita instead (without the pocket), so I obliged. When I dipped it into the hummus, and it still tasted like mildew/must, according to both me and my mother, we deducted that it had to be the hummus that was the mold culprit.    I was just there 12/18 at about 1 pm, and we sat on the patio. My waiter was about 5'4, male, dark hair, thin build, kinda hipster looking. Hope you can look into this so it doesn't happen again. This experience was truely gross.

Love love love the gateway trail at the McDowell mountain preserve! This is the most beautiful well rounded trail in north Scottsdale. With lots of healthy flora and fauna to observe in the fresh desert landscape. 180 valley views and the gateway trail can be done in about an hour!
