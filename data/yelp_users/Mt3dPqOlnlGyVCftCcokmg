Ignoring the fact that Scottsdale Stadium is a bit overpriced these days for Spring Training Giants tickets, its fun. Its basically one big party (in the lawn) with a baseball game going on the side. It reminds me of a mini-Giants stadium (I refuse to call it "Pac-Bell or AT&T or whatever it is these days). The beers are a bit cheaper and there's food everywhere!

In the land of Vegas, New York looks beautiful but the casino inside is meh.. There's a decent food selection and the rooms are nice and clean. But I've stayed at several hotels in Vegas and I know this one is one I won't be going back to.   The highlight of this place is the Piano Bar. Its located near big hotels, but its not even close to the central part of the strip. Everything is being build around Venetian and expanded out the opposite way, so to get to the Bellagio or Caesars requires a cab. And their sports betting area is just a huge disappointment.

I went here for dinner my first night in Vegas. It made sense, get the fancy dinner BEFORE losing all my money.  Bouchon was an experience. An amazing one. I'm a huge Thomas Keller fan but cannot quite afford to eat at The French Laundry. Just the menu at Bouchon makes you salivate, but when the waitress reads you the specials, there are so many items that make you drool even more.  We ended up ordering the kumamoto oysters which are my favorite. They aren't grimy like oysters can be. They are simple, fresh and delicious, complimented with a red wine vinegar, pepper and scallion sauce makes them out of thie world. Then came the pork belly and crab fritters. I find a lot of restaurants to miss a lot with pork belly, but Bouchon definitely hit a home run. The pork belly was amazing but would I really loved were the crab fritters.  They had an amazing wine menu, we ordered a chianti that was lightly crisp and delicious.   My main dish was the Steak Diane a hanger steak in a red wine reduction sauce with mushrooms and layered potatoes. I also tried the steak frites cooked to perfection with a sour cream and chive topping. The fries were even amazing.  To finish it off, the brownie bites were mini lava cakes topped with a pistacio ice cream and the sorbet. Well, it was just the sweetest end to an already perfect meal.  I'll definitely be frequenting the Bouchon in Yountville.

This is the place to go to and this is the thing I love about New York New York. Plasmas lining the wall with sports and random tv shows. But really, if you're at The Bar at Times Square, you shouldn't be watching TV. There are two dueling pianos with amazing musicians playing on them. The musicians are charming and I adored one of them and after our fun little banter, he played all the songs I requested.   If you get there at 8, there aren't many people, so get yourself situated (unless you're a fancy VIP) and stand in front. It will get crowded and people will stand in front of you and they filter in.   Be prepared - I know it's Vegas - but a Newcastle is $8. At first when the bartender told me, I thought he was joking.

I only tried the bacon and cheddar croissant because it was all I needed the morning after a night out in Vegas. Its a casual, order at the counter kind of place and it has an Italian bakery feel. And its pretty much the only thing open in New York New York at 8 AM.

I'm usually cautious of buffets because I never trust them to really be good. But this one is GOOD! So good they have fresh made sushi and fresh spring rolls - among other things. But everything is made so well.  I committed to going all out during this buffet. I had a bacon, onion, mushroom pepper and cheese omelet, biscuits and gravy, prime rib, sushi, fresh spring rolls, pepperoni pizza, waffles, pancakes, sausage, bacon and ate every dessert on their dessert bar (there were about 10 of them).   Just be prepared to wait in line for about 45 minutes. Its worth it though.

Pretty good shrimp and strawberry salad and steak in peppercorn reduction. They're next to the mall so I had lower expectations for them but was pleasantly surprised.  My friend's kid was all about their bread. He could not stop talking about it and I'll give him,  they had good bread.

I LIKE Nine Fine Irishmen! I discovered it a few years back and always make it a point to visit whenever I'm in Vegas. It has a classic, Irish pub atmosphere which I absolutely love. (I'm a pub girl). The food is good and of course, they have Guinness!!! (And very cool pint glasses)

So I usually try not to eat sushi in cities so far from the coast. But we came here for my bachelorette party because one of my friends has celiacs and can't eat gluten anything. So Japanese tends to be safest for her.  The sushi wasn't bad.. I didn't get sick so thats a plus! I did venture into some raw fish and it was okay. Not fresh like what you get in SF.. but okay. But really.. for the price, I'd never go back.. its super expensive for what you get. And my teeny bottle of sake was double what it would have been at a restaurant in SF (and triple just buying it at a store).  The staff was nice, everything looked pretty. But two stars because I have experienced better.. a lot and I will probably never go back.

I was really excited to see the Lion King. I've heard such good things about it and I have to say, it was pretty amazing. It is a production like I've never seen. A lot of time and planning went into how the animals look, how they move and how the actors move with them.   Its hard knowing the movie so well, you have to put it out of your mind otherwise you'll end up comparing a live production to it - and the live production won't ever win.   My favorite actor was Rafiki!

Went here during spring training. I like the atmosphere and the food. However, the hostesses need to learn how to estimate timing a little better. They told us (we were a group of 8.. so quite large, I know) 30 minutes. We were fine to wait 30 minutes.. the 2 hour wait was a little irritating. They did make up for it with their soft pretzels & provolone Fondue, which I might say was damn good.   I ordered the ricotta gnocci which was also amazing. The portions are quite large, so I didn't get to finish. I'm definitely going back when I hit up spring training next year. And next year I'll be with boys so they'll be able to order in very (VERY) large portions.

I was in Vegas two years ago when construction seemed like it was halted on this place. This place make me feel like I've stepped onto the set of Sex and the City -- and I enjoy it. The huge chandelier, the open elevator and the fact that there's plenty of room to lounge, drink and I'm not stuck trying to figure out where the exit is.   Its clean, modern and beautiful. Supposedly it was supposed to be a high rise living space (hence no casino) but it was bought out when construction was halted and the buyers built a hotel. Its different, very Vegas and I'll definitely be going back.

Go ahead and grab yourself a yard drink, you're in Vegas, after all! Its like drinking a smoothie, only with alcohol in it.

This place really is as good as the rumors you've heard. The quality of food is exceptional. You don't have to gorge to get your money's worth but you end up doing that just to get a taste of everything. From ceviche to Korean short ribs, you won't be disappointed.   Of course you end it with dessert and the brilliant gelato bar. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

I like this place! Not only was our waitress super nice, but its got a great, low-key atmosphere and really good food.   We went for the shared plates and the market short rib tacos and Shrimp in Smoked Jalapeno Rioja Butter are amazing. The latter is on the spicy side, so don't order it if you can't eat a jalapeno. It comes with dipping bread to go into the sauce and I didn't care how unhealthy it may have been. It was good.   The crab dip with fried bananas was good, and the fried green tomatillos were okay. Some were sliced a bit too thick for my liking. But that's not going to stop me. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, you can count on me visiting the Herb Box.

Really uppity place in Vegas that isn't that nice. We went because my friend had already gotten our names on the list, but beware, there is a line to get through the front door and another to get upstairs.  Drinks aren't that great for the price.

Had a burger here before my flight and the chef was nice enough to split my plate with my mom (we were hungry, but not enough to each have a burger). They had a generous amount of fries and even added extra seasoning per my request.   If you're in the airport waiting for your flight and looking for a place to eat, they may seem pricey but its because they actually have good food.
