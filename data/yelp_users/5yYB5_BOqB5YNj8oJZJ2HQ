Never again. Forgot my lunch at home so a couple coworkers and I ordered from Wongs. I ordered orange chicken with a side of white rice.   First I'll say the service was great, the people that work there are really nice.   Second, alot of people avoid this place because it looks completely ran down BUT in my past experiences some hole in the walls have been the best.  Now about the food. I'll start with the rice, I LOVE rice, I grew up on it, so I know when rice is cooked properly. The rice at wongs was horrible, it actually tasted like they cooked it in too much water and just drained out the remaining water. I usially finish my plain rice if nothing else but I took 3 bites and threw it out.  The orange chicken actually tasted like real oranges with a very natural flavor, which I loved BUT non of the breading on my chicken was on my chicken! As I picked up each piece the breading would just slide off. The actual chicken left behind was tough and dry and the breading turned soggy in the thick orange sauce they filled half way up the box. NOT WORTH $9.  To add insult to injury my stomach wasn't right for two days after I ate here! I'll give it one star for service, but when the food actually makes you sick, one star is all you get.

Worst fish and chips I've EVER had. The fish was tough because it was over fried and the breading was sliding. The chips (french fries) were cold and tough...NEVER AGAIN.

Service- Great! Moscow Mules- Great! Mandarian sangria- sangria are my favorite so I'm picky,  this didn't cut it, but my waiter was nice enough to see that and exchange it out for a Moscow Mule Calamari- not for me Mashed potatoes- Great! Porkchop- okay, bland in my opinion Filet mignon- very tender and moist but bland Creme brulee- okay Chocolate lace cake- okay  I've been try Flemings, but now that I have I would have to say it is somewhat overrated. There is definitely better out there. I probably also on be back, because I won't spend another , $200 + dollars on a second chance.

Environment: I went here on a lunch date with my boyfriend and we were literally the only ones in the restaurant, which wasn't bad but different. It was quiet and dimly lit and the walls were covered with some pretty beat photographs.... overall the environment was cozy.  Service: our waitress was great,  she was up beat and very attentive ( we were the only ones there so how could she not be?). Like all good servers she gave us our space but made sure all of our dining needs were met  Food: awesome! The  bruschetta was out of this world. I ate do much of it that I could only eat a bite of my rigatoni   I would come back

Squaw Peak kick my booty! It took us about 40 minutes to make it to the top, but I definitely felt accomplished once we made it to the top. It's gorgeous our there and I recommend you try it for yourself. Oh, parking is a pain in the butt so get there early!!!

By far my favorite theatre! Pricing- about $10. 00 a ticket.  Seating- assigned seating so you don't have to worry about getting to the movie theater early to find a spot for you and/or your party.  Snacks- snacks are priced normally but drinks such as Icees  and sodas have  unlimited refills via the self serve machines.  Experience- super comfy recliner seats!!! Perfect if you just want to lay back and watch your movie. Tons of leg space, it's almost impossible to kick someone's chair or have your chair kicked by the person behind you.  I would say this theatre is on par with iPic theaters minus the server, menu options, and price.

really want to like this place...and honestly the food is okay, I would give it a 4.5.  I was really excited to find another soul food resturaunt because they are so hard to find in Arizona and it's down the street from work so that even sweetened the pot. I'm basically going to list the pros and cons of this place.  Pros:  -Free/ convenient parking -Quality food 4/5 ( 4 because my fried pork chop was SUPER salty and my neck bones were not seasoned enough) - Very friendly staff - small mom and pop restaurant ( not a chain, so the location still has that homey feeling)  Cons: -SERVICE ( there is something DEFINITELY left to be desired)- I've been here twice and both times my order was made incorrectly... 1) a coworker and I placed an order.. we pick it up to find they placed my fried pork chop with her sides and her smothered pork chop with my sides. Instead of offering to fix it, they told us to just swap everything around ourselves. So messy! 2) I ordered neck bones with cabbage and yams as a side and a separate side of yams for someone else. I pick it up and there are 2 sides of yams in my container...keep in mind one was for someone else. Before fixing it the argued back and fourth a bit and asked me if I clarified over the phone that it was for someone else....I DID, I even asked her if she understood to put it in separate containers and she said yes. Obviously not.   -somewhat over priced.  All in all I really want to support this place... a homeless man around 19, walked in and said he was down on his luck and wanted to know if they could help him out. The owner (I'm guessing) told him to have a seat, she asked what he wanted to drink, went to the kitchen and returned with a full plate of food for him. It's not often that people express this amount of kindness for someone that can't do anything for them in return.   So I would give the food a solid 4 and the service a 3...making that a 3.5...but since 1/2's don't exist on yelp I will give it a 4. With better service this place could be amazing!

How about NO! The man who works in the front office, is RUDE! I'd rather spend my money else where and next time I will do just that.  Don't spend your money where you are not valued as a customer, when there are tons of other rock climbing gyms in the valley. GO TO PHOENIX ROCK GYM IN TEMPE!!! great customer service, great walls!

First I'll say I have been lusting and I mean LUSTING after this place since September. I don't know what took me so long to dine here but lucky for me my boyfriend took me out for a little romantic date Thursday night and TUCK SHOP was the spot.  I'm just going to make this quick. The food wasn't bad at all but I think I hyped it up a little too much in my head and it fell short of my expectations. I will add that dining here is more than just eating, it's about the art of the preparation and the beauty of the flavors. Just by reading the menu I could tell that so much time, effort and thought went into creating each dish. I'm still very glad I finally made my way out here and I would love to return and try the steak!

Been working out here since my sophmore year of college. If you do it just right you can make an amazing workout out of this tiny mountain. Think sprints and lunges  up a steep incline...maybe even some  crunches and squats at the midway point! I usually go up about 3-4 to really get my blood rushing I can tell you that personally, this mountain has kicked my booty many of times! Also, bring tons of water, I drink about 1 bottle of water per time I go up...even more in the summer.  P.s-  I am not a personal trainer so you shouldn't attempt anything I've tried above unless you've been approved by a doctor or personally know what you're doing! Just thought I should add that :)

My first time at this  Mojo Yogurt location.  It's a great place to go if you need to indulge your sweet tooth but you don't want to feel that guilty afterwards. The cashier was very kind and even informed my friend and I that Tuesdays were 1/2 off yogurt days (good to know). I would say I was somewhat disappointed at the flavor selections; they offered very basic flavors, that you would expect to find (vanilla, coconut, mango, chocolate,etc) for that I take off a star. Overall, cute little yogurt shop and I will definitely return!

Love this place! Very relaxed enviorment and great place to come to study. If you like trendy and that hipster vibe than look no further. I don't personally look got those things in a coffee shop but I do love the location and hiw it opens up to the street. Oh and you have to try the honey vanilla latte...yum!

I've been eating here for 5 years. At one point I was eating here at least 3 times a week but sadly in the past 3 years the quality of the food has drastically decreased. You could order curry goat Monday and it be AMAZING, you could then order the same entree later on in the week and have super dry goat meat and cold plantains. The quality is not consistent what so ever. I decided to give it another shot today and have just decided to let it go, I highly doubt it will ever be as good as it was 5 years ago. New comers nay love it, only because they didn't know what it used to be...boo hoo

My boyfriend found this place and took me for my birthday, since then I've returned twice. Which is only because of distance, if I lived closer I would be there daily.   Environment- It's somewhat hidden, but I like that. It's a smaller venue but smaller in a comfy way. Its dim lit, has a nice sized bar and overall trendy. Oh I do want to say I LOVE the sink in the bathroom, I know that sounds weird but check it out.   Service- My waiter and waitress have always been great here.   Food- In general, I love the food this place has to offer, I've never been disappointed and this is by far one of my favorite burger places. I just listed the things I've tried with my boyfriend and what we recommend! Oh, and the beef used for these burgers is spectacular! Bruschetta Mesquite charred chicken wings Herbed fries + Sweet potato fries Sweet and Spicy Burger Italian Burger Peppercorn Burger Warm donuts  Price: appx. $50 for two people  Overall: One of my favorites so I have no choice but to return. -Perfect for a date night or dinner with the girls

My boyfriend and I had never tried ramen before so we decieded to give Republic Ramen a spin. Upon ordering, we  didn't realize how big the portions were and we were starving so we ordered 3 bowls: Ramen Republic, Shrimp Tempura Udon and Chili Pepper Ramen. Let me just say these all were so good! The broth was hot and spicy and the noodles were cooked perfectly, this place is great if you're looking for comfort food! Because the portions were so large we had so much left over. I would even say a bowl could be shared between two people (depending on how much you eat).  I should also add that the environment was very clean and open which is always a good a feeling when dining out.  It's  a good thing I live so far or I would eat here all the time!

I'll first start by saying I took my boyfriend here for his birthday back in October so I don't necessarily remember the specifics of our dining experience but I can definitely speak on our overall experience.   Environment- The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous; when we were there I remember seeing beautiful fresh flowers in vases everywhere. I loved that. Because it was a nice time of year we sat outside, where there was a beautiful brick fire place.   Service- From what I remember our server was great and our food came out in a timely manner.   Food- My boyfriend and I still talk about the fried pork cheek and ham hock...DELICIOUS. I also got macaroni and cheese with bacon for an appetizer...cheese heaven. Our entrees were just as amazing, my bf had the short ribs and I had the Osso Buco, which I highly recommend. We ended our dining experience with chocolate covered bacon peanut butter s'mores, as well as pecan pie.  I wish I had reviewed this place earlier so I could have been more detailed BUT I did take pictures of everything so check those out.   Price-  $94.22 before tip for 2 appetizers, 2 drinks (mixed and beer), 2 entrees, and 2 deserts   Overall-  Will definitely return!

Update: I used to love this place, but the quality has gone so far down hill, in all aspects. I don't recommend you waste your time here. -------- By far my absolute favorite restaurant in Arizona!!! It was by luck I found this little gem, I was actually headed down 7th Street with my boyfriend to try out a new taco shop we had heard about... long story short we passed a sign that read "Rice Paper- Modern Vietnamese"... a girl like Mr couldn't resist. I whipped the car around and the rest is history.  Enviorment- let me just say this restaurant is located in the cutest most cozy part of Phoenix I would say just about 5 minutes away from downtown Phoenix. I loved how laid back it was, what I was wearing was felt irrelevant but I would suggest leaving your sweats at home. In terms of decor this restaurant hit the spot!  I love that the actual building was very old and they kept  the character of that building by leaving the exposed brick walls as is.  Service- Awesome! We had a great server who was knowledgeable about the menu as well as very attentive.  Food- FLAVOR HEAVEN!!!  Do not live in Arizona or visit Arizona without trying these wings! They give you a choice of two flavors: fish sauce and butter garlic my boyfriend and I couldn't decide which one we preferred so we had them split 50/50....and let me tell you both the fish sauce although it may sound weird and the butter garlic were out of this world! And to top it off these wings were perfectly crispy and I can't say that about any other wings I've had. We also had crispy pork rolls, which were just as amazing.  For entrees my boyfriend had mignon pho which we both loved and I had the braised pork sandwich. I'll speak on the sandwich more so because I only had a bite of my boyfriend pho.  My sandwich was the gift that kept on giving, every single time I took a bite, I bit into a new flavor; from the freshly baked bread to the moist pork to the carrots, the jalapenos, the homemade mayonnaise....everything on this sandwich was absolutely perfect I still crave it till this day!  Price-  appx. $42.00 before tip Overall- I highly recommend Rice Paper!!!

Not Bad! Great if you are just looking for wings and some beers. Our waitress was great but the bartender was just Eh, but good thing I'm not just basing my review off of him :) It has a regular sports grill vibe and I loved the music. We will definitely return if we are looking for cheap drinks before we head home.

I've been here over 10 times. Just like any restaurant it can be a hit or miss but for the most part  N Counter is definitely a hit! I started going here in college. My boyfriend and I would go hiking A mountain and after spending hours burning off fat we would go straight to N Counter for breakfast ( located at but not exactly at the base of A mountain)  Enviorment/Location:  To be exact N Counter is located in the heart of Mill Avenue in downtown Tempe. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from ASU  (Go Sundevils!). The actual resturaunt is super cozy and inviting. In the spring/summer we like to sit outside and soak in the enviorment.   Food: I can never go back to I-hop after this place. Food is always fresh, always hot and 9/10 times always  freaking delicious. Everyone I take here, loves it. The portions are also pretty decent.  Service: you pay at the counter so you don't exactly have a waitress but the staff is always friendly and happy. Food is served pretty quickly, so no unnecessarily long waits  Price: I was there two day ago and  got: a loaded egg white omelet,  potatoes, a side of bacon, and a peach Bellini (alcoholic) =$19.50  I would recommend you try!

First thing first... yelp says I've checked in here 4 times but in real life I've been here ATLEAST 15 times!!! I'm African on my dad's side, so growing up I never was able to eat authentic African food unless I was visiting my family in Texas. Living here in AZ there aren't many African restaurants as all, so this place really fills that demand.   So here's my review: Consistent! This is the key word when describing this place, the food and service is always consistent. I had it for the first time four years ago and fell in love, still till this day the food is just as amazing!!! I'll keep this short but I will leave on this note... if you're looking for quality, authentic  African food, look no further! I'm Cameroonian and the owner of this gem is Nigerian, but since our countries are so close together there are very few differences in our food. If you really want to explore African cuisine, this is a great place to start. My favs: Pepper soup Okra stew with oxtail and rice Pof pof

Just OKAY! Had tacos, burritos, a sangria and chips and salsa...there was nothing too special about the food and I don't plan on returning....oh and service was just OKAY as well... I'm only giving 2 stars for the enviorment and the al pastor tacos being decent.

Plain and simple you can never go wrong at this place. Tacos are only $1.00 and worth every bite. Rather than spending tons of money at a subpar taco place spend $10.00 and get the best street tacos of your life.

I swear I used to LOVE this place.... it used to be amazing, but fast foward to three years later I really feel the quality has gone extremely down hill. I'm  sure I will probably never come back. But if you're new to it, and don't know what it used to be, you might like it. I might go into detail later, but all I will say for now is...you can do better Last thing... do not be fooled by the sauteed mushroom swiss burger!!! They do not know what Sautee  means,  they actually mean warmed up mushrooms

I'm obsessed with Vegas buffets, and I've tried quite a few...so I will say, this place is NOTHING SPECIAL!!! Even though wicked spoon has gone down in quality it's still better than this place. I read they spent $17 million dollars building this buffet; well the reality is, it looks big and expensive but you can can get better quality at the Cheesecake Factory. First off- All the meats were dry!!! From the salmon to the lamb chops to brisket. The only things I found good was the pizza.  Sadly the sweet potato tots were soggy because they were in paper cones and the moisture from their steam, sitting in this cone made them soggy. The crab legs were empty. The jalepeno sausage tasted like a regular hot dog and the carrot puree which held the pork belly was digusting, and the pork belly was of course, dry... Who pays $55 dollars a person for dry meat? Secondly, the dessert bar was a joke. I have a raging sweet tooth, so I literally brought 1 of everything to my table to sample and I didn't like anything, wait, that's a lie...I had a table spoon of whipped cream because it was the only good thing. Service...I won't even go into, but let's just say I was there 2 hours and I never got a refill on my drink. Never going back unless it's free

I Love this place!!! It's was my first time trying Ethiopian food and I regret it took me so long. First off, let me tell you, the portions are huge and can EASILY be split between two people! I find this important to state because when I arrived I ordered a salad, 2 orders of shambussa and an entree for myself...I only finished the salad.   Service: I had to get up and ask for a water refill, but besides that our waitress was great and very knowledgeable of the menu.  Food: obviously this is the most important part of the review and I can honestly say, every cent spent was worth it! The food was flavored to perfection and was very reminiscent of home. * If you like spice, you MUST try the salad.  Simple but very flavorful. * ordered: salad, meat shambussa, meat combo, Gojo combo.

Love the concept, something like an enchilada bar. I tried it twice with my boyfriend and both times were great. The server was super helpful, the environment was very laid back and most importantly, the food was amazing. I would definitely recommend trying the beef and cornbread :)

The only reason why I gave this place 1 star is because my waiter was decent (barely).   It honestly makes me sad to see locally owned restaurants with exquisite cuisine go out of business, while chains that only care about revenue and nothing about food, thrive.  My bf and I were starving so we ordered tons of wings, pizza and pulled pork sliders.  Let me just say, we waited appx. 40 minutes for our food and it wasn't even busy. Okay , I am an adult so I can wait, I have patience. What I can't handle is waiting 40 minutes for food and have it completely cold! As if it was made 40 minutes ago and was just sitting in the back.    I always take pictures when I go out to eat, but this food wasn't even worth the flash. Both my boyfriend and I were so annoyed that we left without finishing our food. A rarity.  Overall: WILL NEVER RETURN. I only wish this place on my worst enemies :)

One of my new favorites!  Service: 5/5 The staff was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  Enviorment: 5/5 The place is named Bootleggers so it's no surprise that you walk in and get that late 20s early 30s feel. The lighting is pretty dim and to add that extra bit of romance, there is a candle on every table; if this is a first date and you don't look exactly like your profile picture or the other person was a little tipsy when they gave you their phone number...this is the place for you! Besides the lighting, I LOVE the decor.  Food: 5/5 Most important part!!! I came here for the bacon board...Yummmy! I'm talking 5 different kinds of bacon with two spicy jams, home made mustard, pickles and cheesy bread. Yes it was $24 but my bf and I agreed that it was worth it! I would just go for bacon and wine if the opportunity ever presented itself. For entrees I got the turkey leg, coleslaw and mac n cheese and my bf got the brisket, coleslaw and black beans. We both loved our food but I wanted to give special attention to the mac n cheese...first off I'm super picky when it comes to mac n cheese because it is one of my favorite foods, and I usually never like mac n cheese outside of mine or my mom's...but let me tell you, AMAZING MACARONI AND CHEESE!!!  Altogether including a beer cost us $71.95 before tip (includes 1 beer, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees).

It's a fun little bar on mill ave. If you're planning on getting wasted, come during happy hour!!! Drinks and wings are super cheap during time...obviously AND you can enjoy fun little arcade games while you're waiting for that buzz to kick in! Also turns into a fun little nightclub ;)

My bf and I came here bc we tried the beer from here at another restaurant. We wanted to check out the brewery gor ourselves so we made out way out here for out Friday date night.  Enviorment- clean and open. The theme of this restaurant is a dog house and their decor definitely lives up to it... in a good way!  Service- our waitress was okay. She took forever to greet us, bring us water, take our order, bring our check and so on.  Food- very very Eh, that's the best way to describe it. My fries were cold, my wings were over cooked and extremely salty!!! Wings are my FAVORITE type of food and this was just disappointing...I ate 3 out of 12 because they were soooo salty and dry. If I were you I would just come here for the beer, which was also just okay.   :(

I'm a HUGE fan of Remy co! The staff is always super helpful and friendly, which is so hard to find these days when you visit a hair store. When I want a product not sold by Sally's I know I can come here and find it for a decent price.  Don't forget to ask about the customer loyalty card!

LISTEN TO ME... If you have not been here yet and it is not after 4pm, a Monday or a Sunday. Get in your vehicle, buy a bus pass, call an uber, or cash in on that  favor your cousin owes you...do what ever you have to do to get here. I too was once like you, going through life, thinking I was truly happy. It wasn't until I arrived at Little Miss BBQ and realized how empty my life really was. Be good to yourself today and come clog your arteries with the best BBQ you have EVER had. I won't write too much because I'm still trying to get over how this place blew my panties off. Get there early....the brisket is DELICIOUS, and the pecan pie is an out of body experience!!! Almost forgot, the staff is BEYOND AMAZING! None of this was an exaggeration

Cold Stone and Baskin Robbins don't stand a chance compared to Sweet Republic.  I'll start off by saying I was amazed at how many unique flavors this ice cream shop offered...think flavors such as honey lavender, bacon, blue cheese and green tea! I was also surprised at how cheaply priced the menu options were. My bf and I got custom pint of ice cream and a three scoop Sunday for $15.00.  I think I found my new addiction, actually I know I found my new addiction! But I think I'll jog here to feel less guilty   Again, LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!

I've been here twice and both times I had a pretty good experience. I've tried just about everything on the menu and  the crab with lemon/ garlic is AMAZING. If you like spicy food then you'll love this place, because when they say spicy they mean it, we ordered two pounds of spicy shrimp and I could barely eat one without needing to chase it with a cup of water. If you don't like the burn, stick with mild. My boyfriend also got sauce in his eye... if your tongue is on fire from a bite imagine that same intensity in your eye. not pretty. I'm a big fan of rice so I always order it as a side with corn. I would say this place is comparable to the Angry Crab  and by far better than Joe's Crab Shack. Why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5: 1.The service both times I've been has been okay, I just hate chasing my waitress around for water especially when your mouth is on fire...but I've been a waitress and I know how it can be. 2. I know the whole concept is to eat with your hands and that's fine, my boyfriend doesn't mind it BUT I do lol. I just hate the idea of tons of hot sauce and butter getting all over my hands and under my nails. Luckily for me they provide gloves. to eat with.

DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO EAT THERE SO THIS REVIEW IS BASED OFF THE ENVIORMENT UNTIL I'M ABLE TO RETURN.  I suggest you make reservations if attending for dinner. Dropped in for dinner and it was packed. Every table was reserved for the night so hubby and I had to leave :( BUT I got a good look and it was super cute. I will definitely return WITH RESERVATIONS!

Had so much here!  First we went to pinspiration and spent 5 hours painting. We then headed to blue martini for drinks and dancing. We  ended our night with a late dinner at modern margaritta!!!! There literally is so much to do here; I suggest that you take your time and explore all it has to offer. I doubt you'll be disappointed

Soooooo much fun!!!! If you can imagine it this place can help you create it! The ladies that work there were amazing and so helpful during the process. They also serve a wide range of amazing wines, which helps to loosen you up before you get to painting or creating!  I would definitely suggest that you make a reservation to make sure you have a space because it filled up by the end of the night... Also don't be worried if you don't have an idea in mind, they have a tablet at every table that you can use to explore the internet to find what you want to make. I don't want to make this review too long...I'm just going to leave on the note that you should definitely try it for yourself it's well worth the time. 4 stars because it's a bit overpriced. You can make the same thing at home for a 1/5 of the cost.

Basically my new favorite taco place! I tried 5 different tacos and not one disappointed. This place is new, and I have no worries that they will stay in business...just based off the fact that they are a solid taco hot spot! P.s- not much sitting space...but I would stand for these tacos!
