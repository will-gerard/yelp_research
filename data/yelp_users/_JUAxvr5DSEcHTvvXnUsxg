Trader Joe's is the ultimate place to buy delicious, healthful, and sometimes organic foods. If you are someone who doesn't like cooking but also doesn't like eating out all the time, you gotta go to TJs. The frozen pizzas are great, the hummus is delicious (excluding the spicy pepper) and they have awesome naan. Besides frozen foods, there are a lot of cold prepared meals that are easy to heat up.  On the down side, their produce is mostly pre-packed and can tend to be overpriced, although there are still some bargains.  The wine department is great for any time you are looking for a fun bottle under $10 to try. They are always changing selections and the staff is generally quite knowledgeable.  I also love that I can randomly grab beautiful flowers on my way out the door...and the flowers are always something interesting and exciting.

This Ace is probably the best hardware store in Phoenix.  It is always clean and well-stocked, and the people who work here are very friendly and helpful. I find that I can get 99% of what I need here, so I don't have to go to the big box out-of-town places.  Whether I need shelf brackets, cords and cables, keys, or tools, I can count on the folks at my neighborhood hardware store to get me what I need.  Did I mention that they carry old-school sodas like Bubble-Up and they have Mexican Coke? Score!

The ladies are friendly and quick....sure, they may be a bit brisk, but it totally makes sense to me....these chicks are all about getting it done.  I needed to get pants hemmed for a wedding and was glad to see this shop right down the road from my place. They did a cuffed hem in two days for $14.   Great, professional, and quick. Old school awesome.

The LGO Commuter sandwich made my day today. I was knee-deep in writing a 50-page paper when I realized I was starving. Thank god they a) offer curbside pickup and b) serve breakfast until 5.  Curbside pickup is a must because the parking lot at LGO is always a cluster...just call in and place your order, then pick it up at one of the three reserved spots in front.  The Commuter sandwich is one of the things I love about living in Phoenix. It starts with one of their incredible english muffin, then they top it with a scrambled egg and your choice of meat or avocado...I go with the avocado.  Based on the recommendation of a friend, I add american cheese and lettuce, and *POW*, what a taste sensation.  You should also try the fresh squeezed grapefruit sunrise (g-fruit juice with a dash of pom) and grab a granola, fruit, and yogurt cup (or GFY for those in the know).  LGO has awesome food, quick service, and a great location.

It may be tough to find, and the lunch service may take just a stitch over an hour, but Peppersauce is the best homestyle greasy spoon south of the airport.  Nestled in an industrial neighborhood, Peppersauce is the perfect blend of kitsch and delish that a old school cafe should be. The service style is a bit different--you generally don't wait to be seated, but can grab a table and your own drinks before being waited on. Service is spotty and definitely diner-esque, but the girls are very friendly.  There is really only one item on the menu that i order...the veggie reuben. It is a delicious mountain of sauerkraut topped with cheese and dressing on perfectly-grilled, buttery rye. It definitely ranks in the top ten sandwiches of all time for me. The fries, are ok, and the side salad is pretty good too.  If you are willing to navigate the industrial park to find it, you should give peppersauce a try.

I almost moved up to three stars because Nicole, the pianist, makes dining here such an amazing experience, but the food just never is up to par, so 2 stars it is.  I was here with the Downtown Friday Nights (aka #dtfn) crew, and started out with a glass of AZ Stronghold Mangus, which was a delight.  We were noshing along, so I ordered the spinach dip, which was so salty that I couldn't even eat it. Yuck. I asked the waiter to take it back , and he said "yeah, we've been hearing that a lot tonight"  News flash, if you are getting a lot of complaints, maybe you should stop serving it for the night.  I'm glad I had a friend's cheese plate to snack on...it is hard to mess up brought-in bread and cheeses.  My Florist is all atmosphere and no substance. The space is great, the piano is awesome (she will even take requests by text message, while she's playing)  **Correction....the GM sent me a message pointing out that all of their bread is not, in fact, brought in, but is baked fresh daily. Duly noted**

Lalibela is my favorite lunch stop in Tempe. It is a great place to go to grab a quick $10 lunch with a friend. The service isn't the greatest, but because of the nature of Ethiopian food (everything is a stew) the dishes are delivered promptly. The only word of warning I have is to not get stuck in the back corner, as the server tends to forget the people back there.   I always get the 4-6-8 for lunch, which consists of:  Misir wat (Red lentils with a little bit of heat, although the level of "hot" can tend to vary from day to day) Tikil gomen (A delicious potato, carrot, and cabbage combo) Azifah (Cold lentils, with a bit of jalapeno for flavor)  The Injera (bread, which doubles as your eating utensil) is perfect and spongy. Note: Don't order the "half and half" with rice and a half injera, instead get the full injera so you don't need to use a fork.   If you want a fun, quick business lunch in Tempe, go to Lalibela

Any review of Delux requires an obligatory mention of the Los Angeles landmark restaurant Father's Office, whose concept was all but completely plagiarized by Delux. I always say, though, it doesn't matter who came up with the idea, it matters who executes it. And, I like how Delux executes the concept. High-end burgers, delicious craft beer selection and great service in a cozy (and hip) location.  Of course, I have to be the weirdo -- I am also a vegetarian, so I can't have a burger anyway. Instead, I grabbed the amazing grilled cheese, which they grill panini-style, cut into quadrants. The baguette, as usual, was perfectly toasty, firm, yet chewy. There is a great variety of craft beers -- everything from Alaskan Amber to Stone IPA. The service is always good, although this time our server was particularly flirty. He actually sat down with my dining companions and I to chit chat. It was charming and fun and certainly added to the fun (and enjoyment) of the meal.  Another mandatory purchase at Delux is the fries -- available in sweet potato, regular, or half and half. The fries are served in a mini shopping cart (familiar to anyone who has been to Father's Office). They are perfectly seasoned and served with a delicious aioli dipping sauce.  Delux is a perfect place to have a sandwich and day drink on a warm afternoon, and I am looking forward to the temperature cooling off so I can waste a few Sundays there. And, of course, Delux is open till 2 a.m., so it is a great option for late nights as well.

Looking for a great place for a first date that is fun, a little different, trendy enough, and is a great place to talk? I would recommend the G-Spot.   The G-Spot serves great, euro-style gelato in small, flavorful portions. I am fond of their fruity creations like the perfectly balanced Forest Berry blend, their Blood Orange, and the Kiwi. I have also enjoyed some of the non-fruity concoctions like the traditional stracciatella and even Snickers. I lean toward the fruit and berry flavors, though, because the sugary gelatos tend to be too rich.  The shop has a small indoor seating area, and a large outdoor patio that stays comfortable most of the year. It is right on 32nd street so there is some street noise, but it is a great place for conversation (and free, fast wifi).  The teeny-bopper service can be spotty at times, but it is a great place to go for something unique and special.   By the way: I know that Arlecchino, just down the street, is more authentic, and possibly even better in terms of quality, but I get an anxiety attack just thinking about parking on the corner that it shares with LGO, Postino, etc. I am willing to settle for slightly less authentic gelato in exchange for a much better overall experience at the G-Spot.

Who came up with these crazy angled streets out in the avenues?  After driving around in a couple of circles trying to figure out how to make a left turn onto Grand Avenue, I finally made it here tonight. I went with the #dtfn crew on the recommendation of cenpho.com, and wow was I impressed.   As the other reviewers have noted, it is in a shady neighborhood and the exterior isn't much to look at, but the interior decor and atmosphere is stunning. They had a live DJ spinning great tunes and they have Blue Moon on tap, which is always a plus for me. There is a very industrial-chic updated interior and a huge bar with more servers than you could ever possibly need. Service was prompt, the outside patio area was great, and the vibe is awesome.   You should definitely make the trip out west to check out this great spot--sure to become a new phoenix classic.

Baiz Market makes me happy to be alive. Seriously.  Great Middle Eastern grocery items, a full selection of great mediterranean drinks, and an awesome restaurant  to boot (See Al-Hana under Restaurants).  I believe this is the only place in town where you can find a full wall of Hookahs for sale in an abandoned videogame case. Seriously.  If there is some rare European or Mediterranean candy, snack, or confection that you haven't been able to find elsewhere, odds are you will find it here.  Oh, and you can buy a whole goat if you're into that kinda thing. yeah, just check out the goat-sized cooler by the produce section.

OK, I have to start out by pointing out that I love Acacia Cafe, but their sign/logo is written in Papyrus....Papyrus, people. I wonder if one of my graphic artist friends would be willing to work something new up for them on trade.  But I'm not here to talk about the logo, I'm here to talk about the food. I have lived right around the corner from Acacia Cafe for going on 2 years, and never went inside. What a mistake!  They have the most amazing freshly-baked multigrain bread I have had in Phoenix. We must have gotten there at just the right time because the place was filled with the aroma of fresh bread. It was so good that all I said to the lady taking my order was: I want whatever comes with that bread.   They hooked me up with a veggie scramble with a side of the toasted amazingness that is their bread. It was heaven  This is exactly the kind of place I love to discover, tucked away next to a dry cleaner in a shopping center. Amazing, fresh food.

I often use extremes in my reviews...."best service" or "worst logo"...you get the idea. Unfortunately, I'm not concerned about overusing superlatives in this review. Instead, eating at Euro Cafe turned out to just be weird. Like seriously weird.  We walked into the cutesy gift shop/waiting area (think LGO for old ladies) and we were greeted by a very chipper young teenage hostess with whom we had some fun, pleasant banter. I was thinking....hmm, this place should be cool. Before we sat down, I glanced over to the large dessert case, which--from my friend's recommendations--was likely to be the highlight of the visit, and I was a bit surprised to see that it was half-empty. And this was at 7pm on a Saturday night.  I wasn't too worried, though. Our server seemed great at first. She actually just sat down at our table and talked all about the menu with us....she was very helpful and made a couple of recommendations. She proceeded to take our drink orders, for me a glass of the Malbec and, for my dining companion, a vanilla latte. We had to re-try on the wine because they were out of the Malbec, but no big deal, right? Our drinks arrived, and she asked us if we had decided on our entrees.This was when her attitude got a bit weird and pushy. We told her what entrees we wanted, but before we could even tell her that we also wanted to try an appetizer, she jetted away from the table. If I may add, she left the table grabbing my companion's latte without asking if she was finished (she still had about 10% of the drink she wanted to enjoy).  The server then brought our salads. Their salad is a nice, standard mixed greens and I ordered the yogurt dressing which was quite nice. We finished our salads, and being the good former server I am, I placed our plates--along with my fork--in a small pre-bussed stack on the side of our table. My friend asked me if I thought they would want me to re-use my fork, and I replied "I'm not planning on eating a $20 entree with a re-used fork". Note: I'm aware that $20 isn't like haute cuisine pricing, but I mean I just don't think you should have to lick the dressing off of  a salad fork to eat your entree at that price point. What happened next was very weird. The waitress stopped by, saw my dirty fork on top of my pre-bussing pile, then proceeded to--while I sat there perfectly still and silent--take my dirty fork off of my salad plate and move it over to my place setting next to my clean knife. Weird.  Then our entrees came. Well, they were really tossed at us more than anything. She dropped the pork tenderloin in front of me and the almond tortellini in front of my friend, which is especially odd since the server had made such a big deal about me being a vegetarian. I'm not surprised, though. I had--just five minutes earlier--seen a full-on food auction at the table next to us because the server had no idea who ordered what. Anyway, back to our food. Our server just dropped the food and walked away before we could say anything....not asking "does everything look ok" or "is there anything else I can get for you". Of course, it wasn't the end of the world for us to have to switch our plates, it was just really weird.  The good news is that my Almond Tortellini was amazing. It was full of fun surprises like sunflower seeds and pine nuts, and the sauce was heavenly. The tortellini were the perfect texture and consistency. My dining companion ordered the tenderloin, and although I couldn't try any of it, I couldn't help but notice that the amount of sawing it required to cut off a bite was more reminiscent of a pork chop than a tenderloin. In spite of the dryness of the meat,  it looked to be a nice balance of flavors, with a cherry sauce, grilled onions, and horseradishy mashed potatoes. The odd service continued, though. No one ever checked back to ask about the food, and when my friend's water went empty it was a full 8 1/2 minutes for the hostess to finally come by and refill it. Even more odd was that once we had clearly finished our entrees, it was a long time before anyone came by to take away our plates. It was 18 minutes between our last bite and when our server came back (yes, I was keeping track by now, because the whole thing was just so odd). She offered dessert, but by this time, we both just wanted to leave, so we asked for the check.  When she brought back the check and my card, she suddenly was miss personality, telling us how glad she was that we came and how much she looks forward to seeing us again. Honestly, I wish she had been so helpful when we were actually still having our meal.  Overall, the environment at this restaurant is just plain weird and uncomfortable. I would love to eat the Tortellini again, but if the price for enjoying that great dish is sitting through another hour of awkwardness in this restaurant, I'll just have to go without

Have you ever bought something and thought "I want to send one of these to everyone I know"?  Well, that is what it feels like when you have one of the amazing parisian macarons at Essence. The chef trained in Paris and it shows. The parisian macaron isn't the stack of coconut you remember from passover. It is more like a giant fluffy cookie sandwich with an amazing creamy filling.  Essence makes a plethora of macaron varieties including mint, french chocolate, raspberry, and my favorites, espresso and caramel. The flavors are perfectly balanced, and the cookies are perfect--slightly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Now I just need to figure out how to ship a dozen to my mom.

If you ever want to instantly "up" your cool factor with a friend or date, meet them at the Lost Leaf. The mere fact that there is no external sign (other than the tacky "open" sign indicating that it is, indeed, the lost leaf) you would probably never have any idea that the best neighborhood bar in Phoenix is inside. When i am asked to describe the lost leaf to someone who has never been before, it is basically a big open house with the most well-stocked beer fridge you have ever seen.  No cocktails or draft, but for atmosphere and quality of beer selection, lost leaf is by far my favorite place to meet people in dtown phoenix.

What do you do when you want a great breakfast downtown but don't want to sweat your ass off waiting outside for a table at Matt's? Well, when presented with this dilemma today, I went with some coworkers to First Watch.  We lucked out on parking since my boss was willing to wait on the street for a while while some dude backed out of a prime metered spot in front of the door. Parking can be a bit sketchy mid-day so be warned.  Anywho, First Watch offers typical breakfast fare. I wanted eggs, breakfast potatoes, and pancakes, the combination of which is not available on the menu, so I ordered a la carte. The breakfast potatoes had the distinctive "been in a steam table for a while" dryness to them (it was 1:30 in the afternoon) and were devoid of any seasoning. My eggs were fine, although I was very disappointed in the private-label "First Watch" hot sauce on the table....it was flavorless and just gross.  The pancakes were decent--the batter is definitely homemade, although they didn't give me enough butter for 2 cakes,  and our server didn't really check with us so I never had a chance to order a second pat of butter. Oh well. I ended up soaking the pancakes in syrup so they wouldn't be so dry.  To sum it up: We probably should have just sweated it out and gone to Matt's. Mediocre food, mediocre service. One big meh.

QT has basically mastered the art of the convenience store. They are always clean, fully staffed, and have a huge selection compared to other chains. There is a wall of every kind of gum and candy one could imagine, and just to indulge, they not only allow, but encourage the mixing of frozen drinks and sodas...yum  I also like the "crowd" system that they use at the checkout. Instead of forming a single file line that snakes through the floor, the customers waiting for the checkout just gather near the register as the cashier handles them two (at least) at a time. Pure brilliance.  Did I mention some of the best prices on gas in town?  Rock on.

It's a Quizno's, so it has all the standard fare, sammies, huge f'ing subs, and that delicious lemonade. This is the location I go to most often because it is right by my office, and they do a decent job.  Because they are located in an office park, keep in mind that they close at 5 so don't count on it as a dinner spot.  I love to grab two veggie sammies...flatbread topped with cheese and a veg assortment. They are a great, quick item to grab for lunch, and they tend to be pretty generous with the toppings at this location.

Awesome fresh ingredients, great fresh-baked scones, and an awesome location at the back of the Farm at South Mountain.   Morning Glory cafe has amazing omelettes--the Greek and Farm are my favorites. They also have delicious french toast.  If you have friends come in from out of town this is the ideal place to take them for a Sunday brunch.

This pub, across the street from Pizzeria Bianco, has a great, old-style pub feel. Nestled in an old house in Heritage Square, the service is prompt ad generally friendly. I went with friends for #dtfn, and while I only ordered drinks (Guinness, of course) I'm looking forward to going back soon to try the food.

Al-Hana makes me sad for one reason: I am so in love with the falafel that I still haven't had a chance to try their world-famous cheese pizza thingies.  For the uninitiated, Al-Hana is the restaurant that occupies one corner of Baiz Market, the amazing Middle Eastern grocery at 20th and Roosevelt.  If you want amazing food, period, you gotta eat here. The pitas are baked in-house and they are amazing. flavorful, soft, just chewy enough, and perfect. The falafel is seasoned perfectly and fried to a crunchy perfection. The babaganouj is impressive, as is the Hummus. The only thing I am not 100% in love with is the Tabbouleh, which is just a tad short on lemon flavor for my taste. If you're feeling like a salad, I would recommend the fettoush salad instead, as it is an unexpected delight.  The set up is a bit on the disorganized side: The menu board is an incomprehensible mess, so you're better off asking for a menu, or even better, describing what you want to the helpful staff. The food does take a bit of time, so feel free to explore the market while you wait.  Al-Hana is a great place to take people who think that Phoenix is just a city full of Macaroni Grills and Cheesecake Factories. They will be surprised at what unique, authentic spots we have here in town....but you might want to warn them about the whole goat in the butcher department first.

If you're out at the hideous fake downtown in the middle of he desert, you can at least drop by Leonidas to feel like--even if only for a moment--you're in some quaint European town, or at least Tucson.  I've only had the gelato at Leonidas, although I have promised myself that I will try the chocolates someday.  By far my favorite gelato is the dark chocolate....rich flavor and a perfect consistency. i like it paired with either the coconut or roasted banana for an awesome combo. The consistency is perfect, smooth, and creamy. The flavors of gelato rotate frequently, so don't fall in love with anything outside of the standard sorbetto flavors.  If you must be out in suburbia, you should give Leonidas a try

What's not to love, fresh food, made to order, and organic and natural ingredients whenever possible.  This chipotle gets a huge line at 1155 due to the Univ of Phoenix lunch rush, but they generally move the line pretty quickly. There is one older woman on the line who can be a bit of a burrito-grouch (she once told me that i couldn't have a side of corn tortillas with my bowl....um no), but the rest of the staff is great.

Do you like acrylic floor lamps? I certainly do, and sidebar has two of them against one of the exposed brick walls in this new casual-trendy-cool upstairs bar on one of my favorite corners in Phoenix.  I went back tonight after having a smashing time there for my birthday party last month, and again I was not disappointed. They carry Blue Moon and serve it properly (with an orange slice) so I'm happy. From what I remember of my first visit (it is a bit hazy) they had a decent selection of beers. I vaguely recall being delivered what I think to be a Chimay Red.  Alas, back to the review. I has a nice, clean decor without looking like somebody emptied an IKEA truck to furnish the place. It is a mixed crowd that skews younger and gayer, but lots of different styles are represented. It is cozy, so it can fill up fast, although I haven't seen it get too full for comfort.   Great staff, great vibe

Gallo Blanco Café has the best brunch for your money in Phoenix.  Our table started out with the fantastic fresh guacamole, which at $7 is as expensive as any of the main courses that I have ever had on the Gallo Blanco menu. I enjoyed the huevos rancheros ($6), which feature well-seasoned beans, perfectly textured tortillas and a delicious chili sauce. They also serve an amazing veggie torta ($7) that I could argue is the best vegetarian sandwich in Phoenix. To drink, you must try the carmely delicious cafe con leche ($3.75) made with Cartel coffee beans.  The only misfire on the menu is the Chicharrón de Queso ($7) which is an over-crisp disaster. If anyone knows where in Phoenix one can find an LA-quality chicharrón de queso, let me know -- please! The Gallo Blanco wait staff is efficient, if indifferent, and the atmosphere is what I call "Clarendon cool." Like the rest of the property, Gallo Blanco's dining room has the sense that someone finished about 90% of the construction, then just decided to quit. The flooring has ragged edges, the wall transitions are sloppy, and the decor is an odd mish-mash that isn't quite eclectic. I am pretty sure that they save the attention to detail for the food, and there they score big time.

After suffering through a lot of crappy Great Clips cuts, I found this neighborhood barber shop right across the street from my house. The main barber here is a young Russian guy with a NYC accent. He was extremely thorough and gave me the most perfect #2 cut I have ever had. He did a straight-razor finish, all for $14 cash only. Highly recommend

The remodeled, revamped Nine|05 is a stark contrast to the old restaurant that occupied the space.  I can appreciate the aesthetics of a building that is more house than restaurant, but it is refreshing to see that Nine|05 now looks like it is complete, instead of the "sort of, not quite" look that characterized Fate.  The soba noodles were delicious -- I am a big cashew fan, so I was excited to try the combination of cabbage, radish and cashews with classic soba. The seasoning was strong, but well tempered. The fried heirloom tomatoes were also delicious, with a savory aioli and basil that made them almost feel like the start of a sort of deconstructed Asian caprese.  The wine selection is decent -- we had a bottle of the Brazin Old Vine Zin, a Lodi wine with a heavy dose of cherry.  The service was good, and the front patio is great for a casual hangout with friends. Nine|05 ranks right up there with Gallo Blanco as a great place to eat and drink, and wait for people to show up. The pricing is on the high side, though. Seared scallops or Hoisin Short Rib will put you back $26.

Revo Burrito (yes, it is pronounced REE-vo) is my new obsession. It's another restaurant by Lenny Rosenberg, the inventor of Blue Burrito Grille, and current owner of Father's Office knockoff Delux Burger and mediocre sushi joint Zen 32. Situated on the same corner as its cousins, Revo Burrito stands apart as a delicious, fresh, pile of amazingness. The best way to describe the food is like a Chipotle that is run by gourmet chefs. The beans are delicious, if a bit simple, and have perfect texture. The rice is amazing; it is creamy with corn mixed in. I have had the grilled veggie burrito (squash, peppers, etc.) and the organic black bean burrito, both of which are great. I would recommend the veggie, though, and order it as a platter with rice and beans on the side so you can still get your fill of both. The combo platters also come with so-so chips and fresh salsa -- get the tomatillo. The pricing usually works out to be a bit on the high side for a quick-service joint: A burrito combo and a lemonade will set you back about $12 by the time all is said and done, so it isn't cheap, but it is worth it.  The burritos are made fresh and the service is very helpful. It is a modified Pei Wei sort of set up where you order at the counter and they bring the food to you. The decor is very trendy and eclectic, although I find it very annoying when a restaurateur spends so much time and effort on the design and architectural detail of the space, then starts printing up signs like "order here" and "we now serve brown rice" on what appears to be a HP inkjet, then tapes them to the registers, counters, etc. There is a reason why sign professionals exist -- use them.  And, the best comes last: The lemonade, oh the lemonade. I could do without the gaudy FastSigns that assault you at the entrance, but I can forgive them because the lemonade is so amazing. They serve a traditional, fresh-squeezed, old-fashioned lemonade in addition to mango, strawberry and raspberry flavors. I recommend going for a mix of the two berries... it is heaven. I would drink it all day long if I could.  Stop by Rev Burrito one of these nights, and odds are you will see me there enjoying a veggie combo. Seriously, I will be there.

OK, seriously people. What the fudge is up with all of the signs? was there a sale on ink cartridges at Office Depot?  I know I complained about the handmade, ridiculous signs that the Revo folks have covering the beautiful, tasteful decor in my last review. But I swear the things are reproducing like rabbits. Now there is a kids menu taped to the back of each register, a framed, printed review on the counter, a tent sign and chalkboard in the middle of the dining room with a review taped to it, and I swear to god, there was a microphone behind the counter that they were using to call orders back to the kitchen, like it is a 1980s Burger King.  I love love love the food at Revo, but please don't let the place get out of control so soon.

'Meh...I've Experienced Better'  That is the perfect way to describe my experience at Hula. After reading the other reviews, I had the distinct impression that Hula was the kind of place that screws stuff up but is very nice about apologizing for it. That is exactly what happened to us.  I went to Hula after work on Friday with a couple of friends. I wasn't feeling too adventurous or particularly hungry, so I ordered the green salad. What I got was a soaked bowl of lettuce mix peppered with chinese buffet-style wontons. Yuck. My friend pointed out that he has an egg allergy, but the server brought out a dish with cole slaw, then took it back after he pointed out that cole slaw contains egg. The server then brought out the same dish without cole slaw, but with aioli. After pointing out that aioli contains eggs as well, the server finally brought out the dish without eggs. She was very apologetic, but it just validated the experiences of everyone else on Yelp....they work hard to correct things, but they should just get it right in the first place.  I do give them full props for the remodel of the space though, the building is beautiful.

Definitely a great spot to go to get a variety of beers, spirits, etc. The staff is generally knowledgable and helpful, and it is clean, bright, and appealing. They have a small, but relatively well-stocked selection of loca wines, and they have Chartreuse (yum!)

Don't waste your time going to your primary care doctor for skin problems (or anything else for which there is a specialist).   After being told by my family doctor that he didn't know what was causing my skin to break out, I scheduled an appointment at Phoenix Skin. Unlike my experience with most specialists, I was able to make an appointment with one of the PAs the next day.  I was a little apprehensive because their on-hold music and most of the rest of the marketing materials for the practice seemed pretty heavy on cosmetic procedures. I was afraid I would go in because of hives and end up with a lift and a chemical peel.  Nothing of the sort happened, though.  The front desk people and medical assistants were great, and they were running on time. Michael, the PA, was awesome. Very personable, knowledgeable, helpful, and empathetic.  Best of all, he knew what was going on and we got everything taken care of. Thankfully, the place wasn't crawling with pharma reps (it seems like every time I go to my primary care doctor, the valtrex rep is chatting up the front desk---maybe a hint?)

I was so excited when i found out that we were finally getting a Fresh and Easy in our neighborhood, i couldn't wait to drop by. I wasn't disappointed.  The store offers a great selection of grab-and go dinners. I'm a big fan of the four cheese pasta and the tortellini. The pizzas are great too, and not expensive at all.  The store also has a great clearance section of items that are set to expire...your best bet to get a deal on these is to go first thing in the morning...you can toss them in the freezer and use them later.  Any of their lemonade combos is killer for a relaxing drink on the way home...and check out is all self serve and quick.
