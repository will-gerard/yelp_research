I made an appointment for a man-pedi, waited an hour (after the front desk gal kept saying "he'll be here any minute"), and the guy never showed up. No back-up nail techs? No apologies for the inconvenience, just a "can you come back later?"   No thanks, there's too much competition to lack in service like this.

I'm lucky enough to live a block away from Scottsdale's Best Mexican food! I eat here quite often (1-3 times/month)... So I consider myself a TJ's pro!   First of all- The Salsa Bar Two thumbs up! The SALSA VERDE IS THE BEST ever, and you can take as much home as you want! The Salsa Bar also has fresh cut limes and radishes, as well as a SPICY RED SALSA and various other toppings.   2nd- Main Course  I love tacos- who doesn't?  The carne is seasoned perfectly, and served on double stacked corn tortillas- topped with fresh chopped onion and cilantro. This is my personal favorite way to eat carne asada.  I have also tried the al pastor, spicy shrimp, and chicken tacos- all of them were also delicious.   Oh! THE ROLLED TACOS  Try them!!  (I order them w/o tomatoes...) They come loaded with guac and sour cream, rice and beans.  3rd- RICE & BEANS  YUM! Try these. Just because you won't regret it!

What a bad recommendation from my so called friends! I will never be back, nor will  I ever recommend this place... to anyone, not even my enemies. The fish was hardly a step above a fish filet from McDonalds... The Pete's sauce is basically a mix of cocktail sauce and ketchup.... The cole slaw was warm... I'm already popping tums from the grease overload. No thanks Pete's- I'll stick to the pub down the street. The single star is solely for the friendly staff, and because zero stars isn't an option.

Echo Coffee is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Scottsdale! I go 4 or 5 times a week! The staff is always friendly and helpful, their music selection in rad, and their muffins and scones are out of this world delicious!  I better go get a latte right now!

Ohhh The Duce, I was SO excited to check you out, and you left me heart broken and feeling a bit abused. I never read yelp reviews before I go somewhere because I am a firm believer in trying it for myself, but for those of you that are avid Yelpers, here's a lil review for ya. Myself and my fiancé, along with our photographer friend and his wife were downtown shooting engagement photos and I heard this place had a very eclectic, hip vibe, totally our style. So we walked in and took a look around. We totally loved the decor and all the funky props. We decided to belly up to the inside bar where there were 4 others waiting. No bartender in sight, not even at the outside bar... We sat for about 10 minutes looking through their amazing craft cocktail list, salivating and hoping to order... Finally a rather surly bartender asked us "what do you want"? Ummm hello to you too! We ordered two cranberry cobblers, a Moscow mule, and an orange blossom beer. $42 later we decided to attempt some photos when we were told there is a fee to photograph in their space. We agreed that if the fee was a reasonable amount it would be worth it because the space is THAT COOL. A manager quickly approached us and said the owners do not allow photos to be taken there. Period. The place was not busy so we would not have been bothering anyone, we did not have a big obnoxious set up, just a Nikon and two subjects... This no picture policy was hard for us to comprehend because it's basically free promotion, and isn't word of mouth one of the best ways to promote your establishment?! The manager tried to explain to us that it didn't make sense to her either... Blah blah blah, fake attempt at trying to please us. All in all the service was rude and slow, but the atmosphere was really cool, the beer was flat, but the cocktails were yummy, even after waiting 10 minutes to order, and another 10 minutes for the bartender to make them. I get it, craft takes time, but part of the craft is the experience, rude staff makes for a pretty crappy experience. We tried. I won't be recommending this place, nor will I ever return. Better luck to you all!

I wish I had anything to say about their food... but unfortunately I never got the chance to try it. Emerson Fry Bread was booked to cater my wedding, and THEY DID NOT SHOW UP... They called an hour before they were supposed to show up and said they couldn't make it. WHAT TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!

My boyfriend, roommate and I went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon because everywhere else was packed for football. This location is not known to do too well as it is sort of off the beaten path in Old Town, however  they have misters flowing out into the street as to draw in a crowd on a hot day, works for me!  We were greeted immediately by a very peppy young lady and seated at a corner table. It took our server 5 or 6 minutes to come greet us, as we would later find out she had a new cell phone and was getting a tutorial from another table? Kinda odd.  They had some drink specials going on so we ordered mimosas. About 10 minutes later our mimosas were dropped off (mind you there were 3 or 4 other tables in the entire restaurant) our server didn't say anything about the long wait for the drinks and went right into explaining the special of the day... after we had been sitting for almost 20 minutes... pretty sure we had all made up our minds!  I hate to say the burgers were bad... but if you have "burger" in your restaurant name, you should probably know how to cook them. One was ordered med-rare and came out with not a spec of pink to be found, the other other burger was ordered medium and came out very well done, burnt even. The sweet tots were room temperature and the seasoned fries were... well stale. On a good positive note they have a lot of unique burgers with fun toppings... if only they could cook them correctly.  The atmosphere was great, the service was slow paced and a little overbearing at times (she shoved her cell phone in my face to see if I knew any cool tricks), and the food left something to be desired.  One last thing, they sell this amazing sauce called "Madison's M Sauce" for $5 a bottle!  After we covered our sweet tots and fries in it we were able to choke them down :)

I feel awful that it took me this long to update my review, I'm sorry Wiley! Rehab Burger is now one of my favorite spots to grab a great burger, and a cold beer! The staff is always nice and funny, the music makes you feel like you're on the beach in Cali, and the food.... Well the food is awesome! I love the Mac Gnarly burger as well as the PB&J burger! Check it out, you won't be disappointed! Oh, be sure to start out with the Pig Wings!!

I am in love with this new spot in Old Town! The staff is so friendly and helpful, the beer list top notch, and the snacks are great! I have yet to try a coffee but they look amazing! Bring your pup, and enjoy their cozy patio, or bring your computer and hang in the eclectic indoor seating area!

Cinco de Mayo pretty much means eat tacos for lunch and have a margarita. So we headed to Taco Haus to indulge in the festivities. We sat on their shaded, mister covered patio even though the temps were in the high 90's we were very comfy! The specials of the day were clearly posted so we ordered a corona and a house margarita ($4 each), it was delicious, a perfect mix! The chips, guac, and salsa were all tasty and fresh, I loved the salsa verde! I ordered the carne asada taco plate with cilantro rice and lentils (I prefer the traditional black bean, but interesting spin) and my fiancé ordered the short rib taco plate (the best short rib tacos I've ever had)! We were easily persuaded to finish off our lunch with the carrot cake and holy deliciousness! I highly recommend supporting the Haus restaurants! Always a nice atmosphere, good service, and amazing food!

Love it! Great Pho, great service (from the Chef), and a really fun, lively atmosphere. We'll be back to try the other, more unique, menu options VERY soon! (Banh Mi Burrito, Burrito Phorrito, and the noodle bowl)
