I have always enjoyed going to Chelseas Kitchen, up until last night.  What a horrible experience we had.  We were in a group of 9 for a birthday dinner, as we were waiting for the others to show, we ordered a round of drinks.  Mine arrived and as it was being placed down, alot spilled and drenched my knee.  The server apologized and got something to wipe it off but did not offer to have it cleaned or even take care of the drink.  We were seated at the table (after everyone showed) and our server came over.  I asked about getting a French Dip sandwich for Dinner and she said no, they dont do that.  I tried to explain to her that I had one 2 weeks ago because I asked, and again she said no.  She asked what I wanted for dinner and I again asked if she would just check with the kitchen as that will make a difference on what I order.  She comes back and says "I was right, the kitchen said they wouldn't do that, so will you order?"  I was dumbfounded but I ordered.    My friend ordered another Beer (the type in a Pilsner glass) and got a different more expensive beer.  She took a sip and said this isn't my beer and called our waitress over.  She said yes it was, and I said NO it isn't.  So she went back and got the correct type of beer.  In the mean time (After a sip was taken out of the glass) she took the glass left on the table and brought it to another in the party, who did not know and did not know us).  We were outraged and went to talk to the Bartender about what happened.  She called over a Manager who asked, after hearing the story, "did you take a sip out of it"?  He stated that he would talk to the waitress about it but did nothing about the already sipped beer at the table.  The guest of honor had ordered Champagne and strawberries for the group and they brought out all but one glass, so had to bring another glass out of much inferior grade.  I learned my lesson, eat at the bar where you can see your food and beverages and what they do to them.  I am so disappointed in how several situations were handled by the staff as well as the Manager.  They need customer service training.

I am a firm believer in if you can complain about it then you should also praise it!  We went back for Lunch yesterday, sat on the Patio, under the cooling misters and we had a nice time.  Our server was attentive, our drinks came right away and our food was exactly what we had ordered.  The fries are some of the best fries anywhere and the Rare French Dip is amazing.  I am so glad that I went back again,because THIS is the Chelsea's that I know and love.  Thank you for encouraging me to try again, Allison!  I will be back!

Came for our usual monthly meeting that meets here on Thursdays (101 Referral Network).  Ordered the Chicken Ceasar Wrap that came with Steak Fries.  The sandwich was excellent and the fries were fluffy, and not greasy.  It was excellent choice and the owners were so gracious and attentive.  It was the perfect meal, not to heavy, not too much.  I will order it again and again...my new favorite!

Went to Zipps to see 2nd half of game of Cardinals...beers were cold, servers were ok, but I did notice that the Mercury team WAS NOT listed on the walls.  The Championship team not there? They lost this customer...

Ok....if you thought it was a coffee haus you are so wrong....but if you want a homey, local place with great hamburgers and french fries, a great cocktail pour and wings, this is the place.  Great happy hour prices.  Staff so very welcoming and gracious...find me here at the next football game, wanna join me?

I searched for a rental company for our Thanksgiving Dinner.  I found Royalty Rentals and loved that I could see what they carried  right on the website.  They delivered the tables and chairs and linens the night before Thanksgiving and came to pick them up Saturday.  The delivery staff and pick up staff were so friendly.  I enjoyed working with them so much  that they were my only call for my next soiree happening in a few weeks.  I know what to expect and how easy the process is.  They are my "go to" company for rentals.  I had another company price out the quote and they said that we had a great deal and that everything else would be higher if I went with them.  I am happy...great deal, great company...

I called on the phone and they were so very pleasant.  As I walked into the Office, It was warm and inviting.  They made me feel comfortable and I did not have to wait until they were able to see me.  They had a huge wall of frame choices for me to choose from and they worked with me until I was happy.    I found my Eye Dr. of Choice, Thank you!

After a long day working, the last thing I wanted to do was cook!  So we decided to go to our go to place, Grassroots.  We have always loved our experience there.  Last night was off, not it's usual wonderful.  From the server not remebering our glass of wine (she actually put down the check and then rememebered that we were still waiting for the glass we ordered), to waiting for coffee to come with our dessert, to the kennel cough diner in the booth next to us it just was not up to our usual quality.  The server didn't even bother to discuss with us why anything was late, or make anytype of assistance to make it better.  Even the filet I had had a cold center (not cool, but almost frozen cold).  I think it will be a while before we go back.  Funny thing, not even a manager came by to ask how our meal was.  Disappointing to say the least!

I held a mixer at this location and it was amazing.  The hotel wow's with its entry way and then the DiamondBack Lounge was so comfy and the staff so friendly.  Tyler helped us thru the whole evening and I can only tell you what the attendees said as they were leaving..."This was the best place that we have had a mixer", "The food was so good", "when are we coming back".  The trays of appetisers that were passed really were mouth watering and piping hot.  I would recommend this hotel and the staff over and over again.  Here's a secret, ask about the summer rates...I know I am coming back!

There are no words to describe the gastromic journey that I took tonight with the tasting menu...it was amazing, playful and left me satisfied.  From the jicama salad, to the scallop, to the halibut to the lamb, to the chocolate mouse and berries it captured the senses and played with my eyes. Chef Sylvania has truly upped her game and created a artistic palette for the downtown cuisine....we are coming back, next week too soon?
