I've been buying gas, details and car washes at various Danny's for 7 years while putting up with their never ending requests to fix my windsheld every time I go in.    Today was the first time that I needed to ask for a raincheck car wash after getting one last Saturday right before the duststorm.  Apparently you have to go in 72 hours after your car wash, NOT get rained on within 72 hours, which effectively makes the guarantee useless. Its been impossible to get in all week.  After all the money I've spent with them, which they clearly track via license plate, it was a big let down from a customer loyalty standpoint, enough to the point that I doubt I'll go back.

DELICIOUS FOOD!  Agree with all the favorable reviews on here, don't quite get the bad ones.  Perhaps the most flavorful meal I've had in Phoenix. The brown stew chicken is my favorite for sure, very addictive and spiced just right. On our second visit we learned its BYO. Take a bottle of wine and they will open it there. Another plus, they have BLUE MOUNTAIN COFFEE shipped in direct from Jamaica!

No longer BYO, which is a huge bummer.  We were very happy taking in our bottles of wine and making a good night of it, often with large groups of friends, but that is no more.  The bill of course is now much higher and the wine selection was a bit weak.

Wow, I came on here to send a link about this place to a friend and was surprised to see so many neg reviews.  My family moved over here from Yorkshire, in the UK, when I was a kid and has been on the look out for good fish and chips ever since!  The Codfather is the first place in 25 years that passed muster.  My folks drive miles all the way from the East Valley to go to this place and I drive up from central Phoenix to join them.  Yorkshire could be considered the epicenter of the fish and chip addicted Brit and even gets riffed on for it.    The couple that own this place imported their fryer equipment and alot of their ingredients from the UK - they even have haddock on the menu which you NEVER see anywhere out here (haddock is a flaky north atlantic white fish that is superior to cod - do not get cod if you can have haddock instead).  As I read the neg reviews I realize most of them appear to be reviewing the type of food vs. the restaurant. Its like giving a bad review to an Indian restaurant if you don't like Indian food - not cool.  Yes, its a hole in the wall and the owner is a no-nonsense Londoner, and yes, NEWSFLASH: fried food is greasy!  But these are the best authentic British fish and chips you will get.  If you don't like that type of food, don't slam a (small, hard working, family run) restaurant thats doing a really good job at it.  Some educational tidbits for the uninitiated:  1.They serve chips not fries - chips are soft not crisp 2. Ask for/try HP sauce with it - thats what many Brits prefer over ketchup 3. Don't get it to go if you can avoid it- the heat of the food in the container continues to steam the food and its not as good (or the batter as crisp) when you get it home 4. In the Northern UK you primarily get haddock, in the south its mostly cod, which is greasier - try haddock if you've never had it. 5. The reason vinegar is typically applied to fish and chips is to cut the grease - give it a whirl

Total fail after being an REI member since 1998 and handing over a small fortune to them. Beware expensive hiking boots - they are less durable than regular shoes apparently. I had some literally crumble to dust while stored in a closet. Granted they were old but in my opinion they should have lasted a lifetime, especially at $250 a pop. All I got from customer service was a bunch of variants on "nothing lasts forever" and "my expectations are too high". Total fail and very disappointed. Opinion of the company forever changed. I have CAT workboots that are almost 30 years old that are in perfect shape. I will use REI to discover cool brands but buy direct from now on.  Lifetime value of customer appears to be alien concept. Their loss - literally. Worst part was I hardly ever return anything and that one time ....aarg.

Sorry, have to vent on this one. I loved Fate for years (now closed) but my first ever Prima Donna Chef moment during my first visit to Sens means its sadly a no go from now on. A dish arrived sprinkled with chopped peanuts, which I'm highly allergic to (very common allergy). I gave it to my friend, but the server nicely offered to have it remade without, so we said sure, thanks. She came back a few moments later to say the chef refused to make it without. It was pretty much a big cold smack in the face and ruined the night. But the worst part was, my serious suggestion to make sure they noted the dish had peanuts in the menu BECAUSE ITS REALLY DANGEROUS AND COULD KILL SOMEONE was totally brushed off. Chopped peanuts look like chopped garlic or onion..I've been burned before with 12 hours of pure hell afterward. Anyway, probably not of interest to most diners, but for us it was a very negative experience, never to be repeated.

Finally got a chance to check this place out last night (Friday). Live in the area and was hoping for a great locals type pizza place like Hana Japanese Eatery is for sushi.  My pizza was definitely delicious...I built my own pecorino, prosciutto, fresh tomato and arugula pie and practically inhaled it upon arrival.  There's no question the place is going through its "hot" phase right now. It will likely last a while which is good or bad depending on what you're looking for.  It's a trendy urban scene with lots of good looking types, .  To avoid what would have been a long wait, we vultured a table in the bar which was full of big groups of friends (yes, it is LOUD but thats what you'll get with concrete block and wood walls).  I'll definitely go back for the pizza, but may wait a while for the hotness factor to wear off a bit. For me, the energy levels need to come down a notch to a slightly less intense frequency.  Although it is a good spot for friends on a fun night out, I would recommend lunch or a mid-week visit as a good option for anyone wanting to check out the food rather than the weekend scene.

OK, wow.  I have to admit, I am an "aspring gourmet" in the sense that occasionally I find a menu difficult because I'm not familiar with the unusual dishes and don't know if I will like them, while at the same time sensing that they are amazingly delicious and I should just "get over it" and take the plunge. That proved to be the case at Nubuo.  My other half and I made the right choice in sitting at the 4 seater bar. Not only did we get to hang out and chat with the personable Nobu himself while watching him at his artful craft, but we also enjoyed the expertise of a friendly regular who steered us to all the "must have" menu items....which at the end of the day, is pretty much everything,  Our culinary inhibitions were quickly put to rest by a tasty house martini of vodka, watermelon, basil and mint. The grapefruit and hamachi dish was the stand out, served as a "shot" in ceramic spoons. Nobu also knows his way around wine, and we were impressed with a Turley red that went down very well with his Kumamoto Oysters with Uni. Watching Nobu prepare his dishes also helped us decide on what we'll be having on our next visit: the hirame carpaccio looked especially good.  The staff are a delight and the experience was altogether sublime.  The dishes are served tapas style in small portions (by US standards) because his focus is clearly on quality over quantity, so if you lean towards "more is more" you may find reason to grumble. However, if you appreciate top notch food, complete with "oohs", "ahs" and "OMGs", put this place at the top of your to try list, we will definitely be back!  Dom Arrigato!

I live in the neighborhood so was hoping this place was going to be a good new local spot and am pleased to say it is.  Nice beer selection and well above average bar/comfort food.  The service was relaxed, friendly and efficient.  Well laid out interior with large bar, table or comfy booth seating.  All the food we tried got the thumbs up and included some excellent deviled eggs, mac n cheese, a cup of their chili and the house burger.  The outdoor patio will be a sweet option in good weather.  Would recommend for drinks and/or a low key meal.

This company, headed by Molly Barber, has been cleaning my home for over three years and I am consistently pleased with the results. Communication is excellent, scheduling changes are easy to arrange from both sides, and I am more than comfortable providing access when I am not at home.  I have recommended the company to several friends who are all equally satisfied. Highly recommend.

Agree with other reviewers - this place rocks. Have been checking out local gyro places for quick after work bites and this one definitely wins.  High quality food, well presented, nice space, also good for solo eating and the wine/beer option is nice. Good combo options. Recommend.
