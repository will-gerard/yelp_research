The best sandwich I've had in my life was one I had at the Teeter House ... the Prosciutto, Salami and Imported Provolone sandwhich.  I was so addicted to it one summer, I walked over there maybe 3-4 times a week to order it.  It was bizzare rolling up in a RVCA tee and a pair of cargos and Reefs while the other partrons were having some kind of Royal Family flashback in their feathery headpieces and pinkys skyward.  But whatever.  I ALWAYS sat outside under their very large oak(?) trees that shade most of their front area.  This was great for some serious people watching ... mostly tourist wondering why Bianco is closed at noon, but attempting the door anyway.  They would eventually mosey over to Teeter ... good for them!  Anyhow, back to this sandwhich.  Its unbeleivable and pretty large with a side of rosemary potato salad and some fruit.  Teeter house also serves beer and wine, which was always nice.  They have a pretty good selection too.  My only complaint is that they open too late (for morning coffee -- although once i guess i looked thoroughly disappointed that they weren't open yet early on a Sunday while they were setting up and gave me a free coffee-to-go anyway!) and they close way too early.  If they serve booze, they should mos def stay open til midnight or so, especially with a haunted house for effect.

I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.  Yes, Majerle's is worse.    Okay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.  The set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.    Moreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.    The bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.  I wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US.

If the city of Phoenix were to ever put out a book "Downtown for Dummies", Fate would land the cover spread.  It is like the Mary Jane of downtown establishments, a gateway drug into our city's inner core.  Leery suburbanites -- and oh are they visible -- lurk into the restored bungalow and mingle with the Scenies.  After eating here, they are convinced that they want to come downtown more and urban-out.  For this, I am very appreciative of Fate.  We need more people downtown after-hours (5PM ... booo!) and Fate is their subpoena.    And this is just what their gentle palates need -- swankish pan-asian pabulum that outshines P.F., but in reality would all make us feel and look a little silly if we boasted it as our premiere Asian restaurant to a New Yorker, Seattlite, or San Franciscan.  Fate is a sleek little spot that feels cooler than it is and keeps you coming back based on the atmosphere and above average food.  I have absolutely no problem eating here -- its good for groups now because their outside patio is huge -- but I'm not going here to be wowed by the food.  I have my two dishes that I don't vary from now and I suspect that once you become a regular you will have those dishes that you will rely on when the time comes for you to throw your divorce party with all of your other psycho suburbanite girlfriends before hitting up Postino.

Shame on me for not acquiescing to the frequent requests by my gf to hit up one of the most alluring valley cafes.  The Paisley Violin is gills full of progressive and retro designs and a charmingly simplistic menu of favorites, including eggwiches, croissants, sandwiches, salads, and plates containing VERY fresh ingredients like organic vegetables, cheeses, cured meats, hummus, and a variety of sauces to name just a very minimal amount.  The prices are lower than what would be considered 'reasonable' and the service is quick and attentive but not overbearing.  However, the REAL reason to visit The Paisley Violin is for the incredible ambiance, whether you sit inside in its darkened labyrinth of art, books, and counter snacks, or outside on its expansive, heavily shaded patio, complete with an artistic fountain and 6 tiny and freshly brightened bungalow houses in a pseudo shopping district right there in their back yard.  According to our server one house will contain a flower shop; one, a bookstore; and the another, a tobacco shop.  The other three are TBD.  It is a brilliant concept, which makes their back patio seem infused with organic commerce and street life, but without being invasive or 'busy'.  I absolutely cannot wait for these places to open, sipping a chai latte with a shot of espresso (my gf's signature drink called a 'dirty chai latte') and gazing at these magnificent store fronts, each painted in a wide palate.    One other note: The Paisley Violin is no longer BYOB, as they are awaiting the lead-legs of the city to approve, get this, their LIQUOR LICENSE!  Fans of The Paisley Violin will appreciate that spirits will now be available -- although bringing your own vino to the back patio seemed like one hell of a bargain to rent their space for the evening.    I am eagerly awaiting when alcohol will be allowed back on the premises because this place will be the gem of downtown.

Jesus.  I'm just going to write a normal review here, if that's quite alright with the homosexual set, after reading the elaborate gay porn allusions detailed and manifested by their experiences at a simple car wash outpost.  Erm, anyway, this place is pretty freaking great.  For a cool $12, I was able to have my (gasp!) SUV washed, vacuumed, and wiped by several people that appear to have a system, though over the course of my countless visits, have neglected to figure it out.  The cost is cheaper for your those of you with the kind of whips that take less than $50 to fill up -- i think as low as $9 for the basic wash.  This place is certainly worth the time (it takes about 20-25 mins) and the paltry scratch out of your pocket.  It is very easily accessible, especially for those of us in CenPho (Oooo, burn!  I said "it").  Who washes their OWN cars in this day and age, anyway?

Duck and Decanter is surprisingly uninspired food.  I wouldn't recommend this as a meal for a downtown diner unless your choices are down to this and Quizno's.  My prosciutto sandwich was dreadfully boring, equal to something you'd probably get in a nice, fancypants hospital like the Mayo Clinic.  There, it would be awesome, but here, as a downtown staple is not noteworthy whatsoever.

As the public house cornerstone of the country's dullest downtown, it does not surprise me that Cooper'stown is as inert as a Swiss nationalist.  What is confounding is that the shock-rock nature of the bar's namesake allowed such a gimmicky, flat concept to be executed.  While AC is something of a badass, this pub does not reflect the image of his avante-guard style.  In fact, its just pretty generic.  I couldn't even recommend this as a meeting-for-a-beer-before-the-game spot, as the set-up is awkward when you do not have access to a table or stool (and you likely won't), so while standing up in the bar, you often feel like you are in someone's way -- either the patrons fighting for elbow room to gnaw their sliders or the pitifully eye-made wait staff expediting that woeful fare.  Still, to its credit, Cooper'stown has been a downtown pioneer, and everyone should give the beautiful warehouse building a hearty brick-slap in appreciation of its solidarity as a Phoenician-style Mos Eisley.

Catching a Suns game in the US Airways Center is liking finding an archaic, beaten down, and otherwise, divey roadhouse that has the capital to serve Foie gras, Santa Maria steak, fresh cut sweet potato fries, caramel infused churros, and Live Oak Hefewiezen.    Such a house is not fit for vamp choices, like the US Air Center is not fit for superior products like Nash, Amare, Shaq, and Bell.  The arena is too small, the grade of the grandstands is too flat,  the mezzanine does not overlap the lower deck,  the sound doesn't keep, the lighting is dismal, the baseline is wasted on a humongous media center, the concourse is narrow and difficult to navigate, the plaza is lame, and as a whole, has an EXTREMELY goofy nickname.  Buuuut ... The "Purple Palace" does have an inviting, simplified, and cozy atmosphere.  Every sightline is a good one.  The commodity that they place on the court 41 times a season is exciting and entertaining and competitive.  After all, as sports fans, MOREOVER, as Valley sports fans, all we ask is a little run to the playoffs, and maybe, just maybe falling into a Finals appearance.  We aren't spoiled here.  We'll sit out in the triple digits if it means the Cards could finish above .500, we'll clamor for overinflated tickets for a division series in baseball, and we'll certainly take the pratfalls of our dinky NBA arena if it means the Suns continue to play the most exciting brand of basketball in the laborious and superior Western Conference.  I just think the Valley's best and most consistent team deserves something similar to the Staples Center than something that should have been erected in Salt Lake City.

If Bar Bianco wasn't dominated by the presence of its immediate neighbor, with its giant international cache, then this bar would have the most outrageous ratings for a Valley bar.  It really doesn't get any more quaint than Bar Bianco, with their converted early-century brick house, hardwood floors, candlelit alcoves, and old-world porch.  Its great to see people just lounging without being in any sort of hurry to escape anywhere.  This is possibly the rarest sight in Arizona.  Moreover, there is a balance of young and old, spread throughout its interior foundations and its courtyard like a discharged honeybomb.  When you take a moment to realize the history behind the square, you sense that the mood probably hasn't changed very much in an entire century.  Being able to look to your acquaintances in closely neighboring restaurants and bars within Heritage Square gives a really cool sense of cultural and social community; this being the second rarest sight in Arizona.  Additionally, Bar Bianco makes it a habit to serve savory and rare-ish wines, my favorite being the locally produced Dos Cabezas Sangiovese.  The price of a bottle is pretty reasonable, although if you wait to order a bottle at The Restaurant, it is priced cheaper for some reason.    Bar Bianco also used to serve Quilmes beer from Argentina, but apparently discontinued this practice.    I've been here as both a subservient to Pizzeria Bianco, but also as a leisurely drinker respite from the binds of pizza, and I must say that its one of the most underrated drinking spots in the Valley.

This place couldn't be any cooler if it was renamed "Jules Winfield's Welcome Diner"  People.  Just take a gander at the picture offered here on this page and tell me what would stop you from going there to eat an unbelievably delicious basket of fries and burger, each such perfectly seasoned to compliment one another, its as if this stuff was made from the craftsmanship of a gastronomic grill master.  The burger easily beats out even cult-status places like Delux or In n Out, and their handcut fries are subtly crunchy and salty.  Their salsa burger topping absolutely rocks the block.  And I don't know if their ketchup is made by the Magical Man from Happy Land who lives in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane, but something about it slaps a toothy grin on my head.  The picnic tables outside make you feel like you are doing something productive while you gorge yourself.  Like its okay to ingest a thousand calories as long as you are given the impression that you are on a hike or something.  But whatever.  Its all class.  My only beef (Heh.  Pardon the pun.)  is that Welcome Diner is closed on Sundays and that they force me to battle the tweakers at the 7th and Roosevelt Circle K as I spring for a pack of P-funks and a $20 bill due to their 'no cards' policy.  It would also be in my best interest if they started serving micro-brews from Oregon or Happy Land.  That would be right good.

[DISCLAIMER: the rating of five stars for Bandaids does not directly correlate with the intentions of the establishment, instead, the volumes of unintentional comedy and unsolicited astonishment that may be had at this specific joint]  Walking into Bandaids was like witnessing the sneak premier of the cinematic masterpiece 'Showgirls' -- and what I mean is, one is piqued with curiosity, wonderment, the promise of mindblowing mockery, and the anticipation of an inevitable Spidey exit.  This is where the comparison to showgirls ends.  Actually, I don't rememer.  Did showgirls feature a stripper in her 3rd trimester?  Whereas the tagline for Showgirls was "Leave your inhibitions at the door", Bandaids follows up with "... and your guns, knives, nerve gases, babies, peg legs, raptor jesuses, gold crown deodorizers, and herpes."  Although I think most in there ignored that last one.  So, upon entrance, you are greeted with a very Judge Dredd-like chain-link protected cashier who takes your Abe Lincoln and motions you over to the bar.  One thing about strip clubs in general, is, you don't really wanna schooch by anyone ... but at Bandaids, they make this awkward dream a reality for everyone!  The walk up to the bar is like cutting to seats 34 and 35 at Giants Stadium.  I felt like Tyler Durden contemplating whether to give the vatos the butt or the crotch as they stare blankly at "the talent".  Whoa boy.  This place has talent like the old Washington Bullets ... but shorter, fatter, and more pregnant.  I gave one of my buddies a dollar to snap into one of the monster's string and she gave him a "whusssuuup" that featured her sweet gold grill.  To appreciate this, you must know that my friend is quite possibly the sweetest guy on the planet, and gave a friendly "Hi!" to her in return before about-facing to our bistro style table where 8 Coors Lights were posting up our jaws.  This was a nice, natural cue for a quick exit, rattled our half-drained beers into the bins and shot out.  We couldn't stomach anymore of anything.  But wait.  On this page you will notice Jason C., and along with the others in our laughter-induced group, came his big mouth.  This was his opportunity to mock the sawed-off, convertible, primer-gray Chevy Blazer parked mere feet from the entrance/exit to Bandaids, and although the details are lost as to the specifics, mentioned something about "check out THIS fucking thing!", which was the perfect timing for one of the busted, ghetto-flab strippers to walk out and proceed to angrily say something like "Fuck you.  That's mine.  What of it?"  In response, and generally because he's a giant puss with scary strippers, said something like, "Oh.  Its nice.  I like it." before shitting himself.  I'm sure the rest of the group howling with laughter really set her mind at peace.    Anyway.  That's the Bandaids story, and you can have one just like it if you give it a chance.

There are plenty of reviews to demonstrate the fortitude and cache of Coronado Cafe, so I will simply say that this is a sweet little spot for a lunch date.   My girlfriend and I had our second date here as one of those safe, sans alcohol, 'is this the one?' dates, which came off perfectly and pleasantly and I looked like the f'in man for suggesting it.  Sucker.  Just kidding.  I love you baby.  Heh.

This won't be the kind of zoo that will win international awards (although in cases with things like 'zoos', there's always an award from some society to hand out), but its a great way to spend a long morning and early afternoon with students.  In this particular case, as chaperon for part of my gf's 2nd grade class.    Something about ushering a group of five hyped up 7-year-olds through the chalky landscape, bomb-pops in hand, loaded up to their D-Backs caps in sugar and expectations can make any place special.  For these kids, the Phoenix Zoo delivered, and in turn delivered on my cautious optimism as well.  A saccharine start in the "Tropics Trail" with a very smooth finish at the tigers, left every single one of my kids-for-the-day overenthused and buzzing.    The highlight was their interactive venture into the Sting Ray pool, where for $3 (trying to remember) they got to dip their hands into the water and "play" with the rays.  This made them literally goofy.    I was also surprised that their food court was fairly extensive and the quality of food far exceeded my expectations.  I had a BBQ burger (comes with an onion ring on top) that was actually top-tier fast food.  I remember it being modestly priced too (in terms of the typical amusement park racket).  Overall, I was highly impressed with the Phoenix Zoo.  As others have mentioned, the San Diego Zoo is the highest standard deviation from the mean as far as zoos are concerned, but I can certainly call the Phoenix Zoo a benchmark on which to build.

I love the "no apologies" approach of George and Dragon.  I've been going to this bar for almost 8 years (which is a lifetime in PHX), and not even the scent has changed (despite being smoke-free, for what, like 2 years)  Its like the Binion's Horseshoe of Phoenix pubs.    Classic.  Comfortable. Cocksure.   Vile.  Smarmy.  Ruddy.  Everything a British Pub should be -- complete with Smithwick's and Fish/Chips.  Their music is tip-top, and though it doesn't exist anymore, I was highly, HIGHLY impressed by their Northern Soul night on Wednesdays.  I mean, holy smokes, what a freaking stunt!  Too bad it couldn't maintain.  Either way, you've got the EPL on Saturdays and Sundays, so this appeases the loss of midweek, underground Motown.  And as an aside, this place is mos def in my Top 5 of places that need to have the smoking ban recanted.  Yes, i have a list.

You would have to also hate puppies and Jesus if you decided that See's candy was teh suck.  The women tending the chocolate bar are like grandmotherly versions of Oopma-Loompas, bewitching your chocolate, pecan, nougat, peanut brittle, caramel, and fondant fantasies.  Oh, and they provide a free sample and a discount on purchases (a substantial percentage) if you are on their list of businesses that qualify.  I was stoked to find that my job was worth discounted chocolate.

Before you bother, CASH only, so bring your ones.  You won't need much more beyond that.  HB's is a decent bar esteemed by my Midwestern friends because (*shocker*), it reminds them of something that could have been 'back home'.  Oh Jesus.  Can we petition to have a moratorium on this phrase for anyone coming to Phoenix from between the geographical regions presented by the Mississippi and the Appalachains?    Naturally, then, this place looks like a lodge in Duluth, with glossy wood, pool tables, darts, and other bar olympics that seem to occupy the minds of the fly over population.    Not bad really.  Just nothing particularly special.  I've had plenty of drinks in here, and never once was I tapping to leave.  Its just a natural progression to leave this bar after you've championed your beer or your cricket group.    Whats appropriately odd about this bar, I might add, is their remarkable and diverse juke box selection.  I can't stride over to the bartender without depositing a couple of dollars of The Cure for the townies.

I'm pretty particular about 'where' i see shows.  A crappy venue can kill a good artist and put up a good fight against a great one.  Fortunately, The Rhythm Room needn't worry about quashing the entertainment value of one of their nationally touring acts.  And the RR really does get some of the best independent acts on tour.  For artists worthy of smallish venues, this place should be as legendary as the Whiskey in Hollywood, but unfortunately, its located on, like the kiddie ride portion of Los Angeles, central Phoenix.  For a venue, they have really smokin deals on alcohol, like PBR for $2.50.  Considering that you couldn't get that deal ANYWHERE playing live music, i consider it a humongous bargain.    They have a smoking patio that you can still hear the music during those 5 mins, and the venue is easy to get in and out of.  It DOES tend to get crowded once the main act is on, especially near the bar, but I've never waited more than a couple of minutes for a drink and i can always find a good view of the stage.  When acts like Bob Schneider come around, the place is ROWDY.  Indie acts like VHS or Beta and Midlake are near priceless to see in such a small joint.  and sometimes shows that pique too much interest will be moved to their big cousin Marquee.

There's a freaking terrarium in the bar.  Ooookay.  I can dig that.  I can also dig the eclectic juke box.  Willie to Rush to LFO.  Alright, I don't know if LFO is really on there, but I would't be surprised if they did.  I'd jam to "Summer Girls" given the chance ... follow it up with "Pancho and Lefty" and we're golden.  And no one seemed to mind when I was drunkenly playing their PBA Bowling Arcade Game by rolling the trackball with my ass [hey, it got a cheap laugh].  Cheap drinks to boot.  I'm surprised that I kinda forgot about this place.

The Rokerij is kinda weird.  Its almost like two completely different entities, meaning their restaurant and their basement bar.  First, the restaurant.  I give it "four thumbs aight".  I've had better steaks, but never in a cozier environment.  Their booths are ridiculously private and can be really romantic.  Until you stare across the way and see some baby boomers molesting each other under the table.  You can bring your own bottle here, but their corking fee was $25 or $30 which made me really kinda laugh to myself, but not out loud because i didn't want to disturb the mood of the evening or the piranhas in table 4.    So, my $10 tip-top Malbec brought back from the actual country of Argentina via me and a large airliner (vino is amazingly good and cheap there), was now $40.  Whetever.  I just expected myself to be in LOOOVE with the food which was not the case.  However.  Their basement bar is pretty much the most unique place to drink in the Valley.  Its focused around a wood burning fire and this is precisely where you go to get a strong cocktail or a deep red wine.  If you can snag the fire-front seating you will want to park it right there all night.  Man, when they used to allow smoking down here, it was like being in the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes Lodge.  Too bad.  Another case of the gubments saving us from ourselves.

There's nothing really to say that hasn't already been said about Merc, but i wanted to add my 5-star opinion to the lot.    The music is good, the cocktails better, and the ambiance the best thing about the place.    I don't know how they manage to avoid the d-factor, but they really do.  Maybe the music, low lighting, and classy vibe settles the buckle-shoe wearers down, so, to that I say, "well done, merc"  The drinks here can really add up, tho ... and its not a complaint, just be prepared for it is all.

First of all, everyone shopping here needs to slow their roll.  Okay.  You are groovy and 'green'.  You buy Jicama milkshakes and no-pesticide turnips.  Your NHW20 Hybrid Prius awaits your herbal carriage and will rip you home to your grass and mud 15 story energy insulated highrise hut at a full 110 horsepower; "We can do it" Rosie the Riveter tats blazing with your arms out the open windows to conserve the 1,986/miles per gallon gas tank .    So turn it down a molecule, Janis Joplin.  So, now that my little beef (erm, pardon the pun) is outta the way, I must say that I very much enjoy the inventory of TJ's.  First and foremost, I never leave here without restocking the $3 buck Chuck - Shiraz and Cab for mid-week meals when you don't feel like busting out the $15-$25 dollar vino.  The rest of the wine selection is surprisingly so-so and seems to have faltered in the last few years.  A once proud beer selection (and they allow you to mix-n-match sixers) has also decreased in quality, though they DO stock a nifty amount of Oak Creek Brews, which any proud Arizonan will stock up on without nary a glance at the Guinness or what have you.  The produce is not as expensive as the organic section of Safeway, so its a good place to stock up on a few extra 'healthier' (*cough*) veggies (my fiancee thinks so, anyway) at no extra charge.  Their meat selection is pretty decent for a store whose clientele are poster-children for the PETA Militia.   TJ's is a nice place to supplement you grocery stash, but I just don't think I could do 100% of my shopping here -- and this from someone who eats-in very healthily about 95% of the week.  We have staples here that we almost always pick up -- that wine I mentioned before, edamame, veggies, a variety of fish, beer, and a couple of snacks like popcorn or cookies -- but that's primarily it for TJ's.  My fiancee likes the plant/flower selection too, and I suspect that any female would, especially if she wears a cute lilac bandana, wears overalls to paint, and says stuff like "eww meat".

I'm on to you Barnes.   Which is a good thing because until recently ... like, as in TODAY ... I always drove my dumb arse to Tempe Marketplace from downtown PHX to get to a Barnes and Noble bookstore because its my literary outlet of choice.  Yadda yadda yah, about indie bookstores or whatever.  Save it for someone who can be influenced.  When I'm shopping for books I want to find the damn book I'm searching for, and B&N has not typically let me down on any of these quests ... and in this case, they gave a giant 'bitch-slap' to Borders (which is always a wreck, man, I hate shopping there) by having the Molecular Gastronomy book I'd been on a search for now for a couple of weeks.  Actually, they had three, which is three more than any indie bookstore or Borders had.  I don't care that they're trying to get one passed me.  Fool me once ... okay go ahead, but d'ya got my book in stock?  I'm just pleased that I don't have to drive to Tempe Clusterfuck to be able to enjoy their layout and friendly prices.

Only the Biltmore Apple Store can make the typical shopper (me) feel like a total douche just by walking inside of it to be exposed to the cultish behaviors of Apple fanboys and girls.  This must be, like, the Ganges of Apple secularism.  One might introspect, "Is this me?"  No.  Its okay.  You certainly aren't one of the tools extolling Steve Jobs father's testicles for blessing the planet with the Divinity who created the most streamlined electronic products ever exalted on God's green Ge.  But look around, and this is what you will see at this particular locus.  Interacting with the sales associates, these coal-shirted devotees, is what I imagine Muhammad faced when he met his 72 virgins in heaven.  These virgins, however, are massively haughty and generally useless.   In order for one of them to grace your presence and acknowledge your need for assistance, one must either 1) act like you're walking out of their store with one of their pretentious product under your shirt, or 2) make an appointment with their "Genius Bar".  F me running.  What a crappy state of affairs customer service is at this place.   Let me get this straight, I cannot get anyone to help sell me overpriced, buggy Apple products unless I had the foresight to book their arses a week before?  Moreover, should the frequently occurring Apple jinx strike my iPod, its gonna take an appointment to tell me that you cannot fix it because you are not, IN FACT, a genius, but a $10 an hour fandork of Apple products and you wanted the 5% employee discount?  The 2 times that I've had problems with my iPod (i know, what a shocker!), they've just suggested that I reformat, thus erasing all of my files and losing playlists, et al.  Thanks genius.  Thanks for keeping up the good fight vs Microsoft, dweeb.  And thanks for allowing me to check out -- not at the cashwrap, but right here, where we stand -- amongst the packed section of iPhones, where people are dorking out to these things.  I appreciate the dapper service, even though I'm plopping down the loot for two 'pods (which will inevitably be returned for two new ones in a few short months after I stump the geniuses over at the bar).    Now, I'm just blue-skying here, but how about you treat me like an actual human customer instead of an ATM machine, given that I've purchased 6 or so Apple products within the past 4 years?     I hate that Apple has been crushing the portable music market for several years now because their outposts for customer service are absolutely abysmal.

Postino has really evolved their restaurant for the better over the past 5 or so years since I began going there.  Their wine list has always been, current, going with the latest trends in grapes ... from Cabs in the early 00s, to Pinots in 03-04, and now featuring Malbec and Tempranillos.    While this is slightly frustrating as a wine (whine?) snob, i have to give it up to Postino for making available the varietals that people like me want to drink when they're spending $11 a glass at a wine bar.  I'll always pretty much have a soft spot for this place, as it was the site of some magical shit between me and my gf (Iknow, I'm romantic) on our first ever date.  So, if you ever need an idea for a first date, or a 50th date, this is your spot.  My favorite thing on their menu is the Bruschetta board (and please say the freaking word right), and all of their choices of toppings.  Mmmm, Brie and Granny Smith apples, Mmmm, prosciutto, Mmmm, white tuscan beans ... etc  This place gets super packed to the point of claustrophobia, so thats my only minor annoyance ... oh and the smoking area that is nearly in Peoria.

Max Fischer: What was your major?  Rosemary Cross: I didn't have a major, but my thesis was on Latin American economic policy.  Max Fischer: Oh, that's interesting. Did you hear that they're not going to teach Latin anymore?  Rosemary Cross: This was more like Central America.   Ha.  Okay.  That exchange doesn't have anything to do with my review of Havana Cafe, only that it dances with the South-of-the-Equator theme.  Which, in actuality, is the same concept of Havana Cafe.  That is, its a Cuban restaurant with heavy Latin American themes.   First, and I must emphasize, FOREMOST, their alcohol selection is nothing short of brilliant.  They import an enormous amount of South American and European-cum-Latin influenced wines and serve it both by the ounce and the liter.  Fascinatingly, they have Portuguese reds, which i have been exhaustively looking for, either in-store or dine-in around the valley.  Praise be, I've finally found the place!  They also offer Argentine reds and whites, Chileans Sav Blancs, and Spanish Tempranillos.  Perfect selection, and VERY reasonable for their exclusivity.  Their Douro was a serf-encouraging $8.  That's not very many Escudos, no not at all.  For beer, they had several unique selections, most notably the inclusion of Argentina's Quilmes.  Honestly, i cannot remember what other selections they had, though i remember being roused by the list, only to be seduced by the Porteno brew of choice.  Their selection of rums, and the accompanying list of rum cocktails was also impressive, though sadly sans Havana Club Rum due to America's archaic embargo vs the snarky nation of Cuba.  Blast.  When the food came out, I was impressed by the presentation.  To start, my gf found it in her gullet to order the hearts of palm/carrot/various rabbit food appetizer, which was heavily drowned in vinegar.  i liked it, but she didn't care for it all too much.  My app was the serving of 3 croquetas filled with ham with a side of mildly spicy aioli.  Not bad, but slightly mushy.  Fry them up a couple more minutes and I would have gladly accosted my taste buds with volcanic pork pieces even further.  My entree was the poached chicken with shrimp and rice, which tasted well and good on the first try, but went up to 11 on the re-heat the next day.  Fucking glorious.  My gf had the stuffed squash with a Jamaican curry cream sauce.  She was thrilled with it because she likes vegetables and shit, and this was the motherload of veggie heaven -- veggies filling veggies like some plant orgy.  Okay, so why the empty star?    Its pricey.  What was meant to be a casz dinner ended up surpassing the century mark.  Not a problem really, since we got 2 rounds of the good stuff, plus basically dinner/lunch out of it, but it COULD turn some people off.  All in all, i felt it was slightly over-valued.   Still, this will NOT keep me from coming back.  There is just too much fucking potential here and so many unfurled selections. I've gotta take down their wine list.  I wonder if they offer an around-the-world-wine-club card like some cheesedick chain like The Yard House.  I will be here for as many happy hours and apps as is necessary to finance the country of Cuba and bypass any restrictions put onto me by the governments.  Go here and do your part too.

All the credit goes to Graham C. for schooling my arse in this particular foodie rodeo.  You see, there is a group of 4-5 of us who have pretty much scoured the Valley for hidden gems and blatant dumps so that we can report back at their respective grandness or offensiveness.    One day, Graham asks if I'd ever been to Chicago Hamburger Co and I had to embarrassingly admit that I hadn't.  That fucker.  So, leads the way to the counter and orders an unholy amount of sliders, which we each put down without any sorts of problems because mother of God, they were delicious.  I'm pretty sure that we would have gone back up to the order counter to request more, but the place was very busy at lunchtime on a Saturday and we also had to rush to pick up others on the way to the FBR.    Apologies for more of an anecdote rather than a review, but you can pull three things out of this review:  1) Their sliders are perfect, particularly the Double Burger 2)  Its crazy busy on Saturdays at lunch 3)  Graham C is a cocky wanker

Carolina's is likely the most 'authentic' and delicious Chihuahuan-style food in the Valley, at least that I've come across.  This is the style of Mexican food that I grew up eating, and although I love the whole spectrum, this type is my favorite due to its greasy-ness, inclination to corn tortillas, and beef ... lots n lots of beef.  Carolina's is certainly the bare-minimum of establishments.  There is an order-counter, almost soup-nazi-esque as far as the intimidation factor goes, but the staff is extremely friendly and will help you customize your order.  You then have to wait for your number to be called as you stare at your oozing tiny dixie cups of salsa in anticipation.  I always get the machaca burrito (holy smokes, my mouth is literally craving it now -- dammit, why did I write this so close to lunchtime?)  with sides of rice and beans.  I'm a bitchy critic when it comes to the latter, as the entire female familial line of P.'s can work out some magical rice and beans, yo ... and these compare favorably.  I wish Carolina was in my family.  Oh, and they rock red Fanta as a soda option because they F'ING KNOW that the Mexis love their strawberry bubblegum flavored drinks.  I can never pass up this option no matter how hard I want Dr Pepper or Sprite instead.  Some sort of congenital condition, like its a vital fluid, that red Fanta.

If you ain't out lookin for Bobby C's, well, Bobby C just ain't gonna come lookin for you.  We all wanna talk about 'hidden gems', and such heavy words are so lightly thrown, but Bobby C's is definitely worth scavenging around downtown for a sample of their southern soul food.  A few months have passed since that visit and I can still sense the taste of their gravy topped chicken fried steak with a side of potato salad and dirty rice.  Christ, is that making your mouth drown in yearn?  They've got all the other fixins as well ... smothered pork chops, fried chicken, hot wings, catfish, fried shrimp, meat loaf, collard greens, candied yams, black eyed peas, green bean ... they EVEN have a vegetarian platter (my gf jumped on that grenade for NO reason as she's only about a 60-40 veggie -- but chose the wrong time to sway to the green side.  Um.)  The bar itself is limo-dark and festive near the end of proper happy hour time.  We got there about 6 or 6:30 and we were three of about 8 people in there.  By the time we left the dining area and most of the bar was full.  We got Miller Lites cos that how we were rollin this day, I suppose, and we even got to smoke a square in the parking lot with our waitress who was all fired up about something to do with her ex.  She was a badass.  They've got live music nights too and what seems to be a semi-formal jazz-supper club.  How they are crushing all of these dynamics into such a tiny space is kind of wondrous.  I couldn't really peg this place properly, so I'm just gonna go ahead and give it another go.  One thing I AM certain of, is this place is leagues better than neighborhood giant Mrs. White's Golden Rule.

In the style of Ignatius J. Reilly   This city is famous for  its pablum strip mall culture, its tweaked city-vagrants, Antichrist shadeless palms, artificial tans, frauds with transfixed hairstyles, fetishists in stilettos, sodomites, drug addicts, exhibitionists, internet punchers, and litterbugs, all of whom are too reconciled by the lagniappe.    If you have a moment, I shall endeavor to discuss the portion of this shambles that makes up for the dissident of its surroundings, Sky Harbor Airport which i bothered to scribe into my Big Chief Tablet during my last expedition to fairer country.  It is rather fine.  It is not only clean, but impeccable.  The staff is quite firm on the rules, which I was not made aware that a lute may pass through their customs, but not my British Honduran macaw or Belizian soy nuts.  Ho hum.  I had to insert them into the bowel of the plane, which is right where I told the wanded lady to stick her apparatus.   I wandered up into Terminal Four, exceedingly the only port worth venturing from, with its hoards of awful fat inducing foods that I would never let my indulgences approach.  So, I had several plates of Chili Cheese Fries and four bloody marrys at Fox Sports Grill to block my urge from any of the other filth this corporate consortium of overfed Americana bestows on its citizens.  Filth!  Not me.  No way would I indulge here.    Though Terminal Four is quite a pleasant atmosphere, and allow myself to reiterate, the best port of exit, there is a severe mass of human activity.  If you are like myself, you won't enjoy the egregious offense against good reading at all of the newstands and boutique book shops around the mall area.  The "Somebody in Arizona Loves Me" apparel is without shame entirely!  Still, if I must leave my beautiful burg in the sun, I enjoy the comforts of this guttersnipe and bawb babble infested airport.  Its just slightly above ho hum.  But only a just little.

South Mountain is the place for a hiker to visit when he/she doesn't want to deal with the headaches and the mass of humanity that are Camelback and Piestawa.  Granted, there are reasons for their popularity, and no, South Mountain isn't really on their level as far as personal challenge or scenic masterpieces go, but its a very solid alternative for a weekend hike when you know that the line of cars for parking is stretched a mile long in central/north Phoenix.  My gf and I usually hike the Alta trail, which is a progressively steep trail up to the peak, but still a manageable grade in slope that you will never have to use your hands to ascend or descend.  It takes about an hour and 15 mins to go up and down the mountain, and the view of SoPho, Downtown, Glendale, and Tempe are killer.  Its a great place to snap a few pics of the enormous city below.    Typically, we will run into one or two hikers maximum on this hike, which pretty cool for some solitary reflection.  Lately, I've taken up bringing my iPod along, as there is nothing quite like descending the valley into the park amongst massive mountains with Band of Horses or The National narrating your steps musically.  Breath taking.

I'll say it.    There is "sushi".    And then there is "SUSHI"  What most people consider sushi is some form of rice-rolled fish in a seaweed wrapper.  Maybe some cucumber rolled in if you're feeling inventive.  But what Sakana serves is so far beyond what I've had anywhere else, its almost sad for them to have to downgrade themselves as serving the same cuisine as some other throwaway joints around town and hell, around the country.  When you find your favorite sushi spot, you just 'know it'.  Its like reading your car manual and discovering you have a sweet feature you haven't even been utilizing.  Then you abuse the fuck out of it.    I want to abuse the fuck out of the Sakana yellowtail, both in Nigiri and Maki form.  It is the freshest I've had anywhere, and (pardon the name dropping) but I've eaten at Koi in LA and Miko in Vancouver.  How they do it in a land-locked dustbowl is a mystery to me.  Whatever magic they use works, which they also must use to enlarge the rolls because they are a GREAT size.  Not too big so you can't get em in one bite, but almost.  For their size, the prices are VERY reasonable.  Go here for your every-day-sushi and stop throwing it away at shi-shi celeb ventures like SeaSaw and Stingray (disclaimer: There is CERTAINLY a time for celebrity sushi, but IMO, not appropriate for everyday dine-out sushi)

This restaurant give me a profound case of chronic eye-blech and the only cure for this is severe eye-rolling.  It makes me feel silly being in here, the corniness of the grounds, down to the "slide" into the restaurant and the token longhorn out front.  Its one of those places that you smile at your company and pretend that the BBQ ribs are delicious and not massively fatty as if the steer was fed in the corn varietal Cap'n Crunch.  I feel slightly embarrassed as a Phoenician that THIS is the place they choose to host the participants of the Valley bowl games, as it does not represent the authenticity of the gorgeous valley cuisine.  It's beginner Texas Bar-B-Que, which, if its a style you're unfamiliar with, tastes adequate.  I'm not sure I even saw a pit or a smokehouse on the premises, so in retrospect, I would actually think about sticking with the chicken.   But there ARE some positives to Rustler's Rooste.  The views are second to none for a Phoenix-area restaurant.  And they serve Shiner Bock on tap, into a mason jar, and down your gullet.  Their happy hour specials seem really good, and you know, when discussing the matter of your middle-aged co-workers in Friday jeans and hair buns, The Rooste's thematics actually works in a charming way.  As a bonus, you actually get to avoid the throngs of MidWesterners and their children during this time of the day.  Overall, this place is a very uncreative knock-off of Cattleman's Steakhouse in Fabens, Texas.

The guilty pleasure of sports bars.  Fox Sports Grill is essentially Half Moon on Creatine (TM) ... from pull taps, to cozier couches, to wider LCD screens, to pricier filets.  But .. you will pay for this luxury.  Catching a full round of NFL playoff games might set you back a cool hundo, so stop fucking placing the Chargers as your ass-end of the trifecta, cos you'll need this disposable loot for your tab.  As per the 'neaveau-posh' sports lounge motif, it is limo-dark and comfortably chilly.  I would go here more often if it wasn't in butt-fuckin-scottsdale.

If I were to move out of Phoenix tomorrow, Lo Lo's would be the place that I would regretfully leave behind.  Its still pretty unbelievable to me that chicken n waffles is still a unique concept around the US -- this combo should be served at baptisms, first communions, bar mitzvahs, wedding, and wakes.  Indeed, every time is a good time for chicken n waffles.  However, ONE specific time exceeds all the others.  That is, chicken n waffles as hangover food.  Nothing soaks up those poisons like a Tre Tre's platter with a side of grits and a Dr Pepper/Red Kool Aid.  This is a perfect place to take out of towners, particularly because of what most consider a bizarre concept (until they try it .. then they're like all "ooooohhhhh") and for the cool southern-style coziness.

Portland's is not the kind of place that is gonna 'wow' you with anything outrageous or unique, but as it stands, it's a cozy-feeling wine bar putting up the good fight as a downtown outpost of social activity past 5PM.  The bar is the first of its kind in Phoenix -- at least in the last 40 years or so -- to be incorporated as a important portion of mixed use development, providing much needed libations and nourishment for tenants of downtown midrise condo living.  For this, i truly salute Portland's.    This bar not only sees its share of regulars -- likely upstairs tenants -- but also mid-week imbibers of wine and beer, which keeps the crowd fresh, interesting, and rotating.  They even have some decent set-ups for subtle cross-bar HD sports watching ... prevalent, but unimposing.    Their patio addresses the cleverest part of central Phoenix, essentially the gateway into downtown and the oddly designed city-roof that is the 7th to 7th pathway.  The vibe is a good one because the neighborhood is charming and as close to urbanism as PHX will allow.

Welp.  Its unavoidable to compare Chez Nous on Grand with Char's over on 7th Ave, so I will do a dual-analysis of these spots.  THE ATMOSPHERE: Char's is just a friendlier place.  Their doorman doesn't DEMAND his $5 like a put-out paperboy.  Chez's does.  Its kind of annoying and unsettling as your introduction to a night of hi-falutin drinking and lo-falutin boogieing.  Char's clientle seems to be in higher spirits and more polite as well.  Chez's are chilly.  Burrr.  If you stand in front of their seat to order a drink from the bar (because they went to go dance or something) they will let you know that you may NOT continue to stand there, even for a second.  The bartenders at both places are sweet and quick about their service.  THE DRINKS: Weak at both places, but IIRC, they are cheaper at Chez.  The no-card policy at Chez is a nuisance, so Char's is preferable here.  They both serve the typical booze and beer, so nothing really stands out other than the cost (Chez cheaper) and the convenience (Char's takes card).  THE MUSIC: They are both MANIACALLY cool spots for some soul-funk-blues and great dance floors to boot.  This is the main reason to but up with any inconveniences, small or large, at either place.    THE SET-UP: Just packed at both places.   If you want to come at a decent hour, you won't get a seat.  So, just forget about it.  Both buildings are pretty neat setups.  Chez is more of a railroad-style-room, and Chars more of a dance-hall set up.  Both have smoking patios, though Char's is small and quaint with tables and a busy atmosphere, while Chez's is (assuming) not complete and barren but large.    OVERALL: Char's Has the Blues AND the lead over Chez due to the fact that I can't seem to get over the vibe that I don't belong to "The Secret Club" ...shhhhh ... over at Chez.  But whatever, the drinks, music, and dancing will get me going at either place.

Did you know you can actually discover in Wikipedia, a list of unusual names, both given and acquired?  Check it out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_personal_names .  Whats funny, is that "Bruno Mali's Cafe & Gift" is such a misnomer, i can't even begin to understand what is meant by such an awkward handle.  Add it to the list?  Let's investigate.  Bruno Mali's is neither a cafe nor a gift (not even a gift SHOP), unless you consider $2.50 vodka-and-whatevs a present from the Goddess of Lush.  In fact, i do.  So maybe Bruno's is onto something here.    Do I consider it a gift that DJ Al is on the decks playing both familiar beats and engagingly random-assed verses?  In fact, I do.  Cheap drinks and beats for a smallish $8 cover?  Por favor, believe it.  This place is one-of-a-kind in the valley and mos def a friday/saturday night destination as long as they keep doin what they're doin.

Ah, the old adage, "if you see a [insert ethnic minority] eating in a [same ethnic minority] restaurant, then you KNOW it must be good."  While this is true, and especially in the case of Vaqueros, this burrito joint is the type of place that can dissolve racial discrimination and bring all the colors of the planet together under one orange and yellow striped world, where the rivers flow with beans and cheese, the mountains are  heaps of carne asada, the trees harvested as flautas, and the raindrops on your tongue taste like freshly made red salsa.  Seriously.  Their asada burritos are filled with insanely large portions of meat and guac.  Their rolled tacos have a heap of cheese and guac and their red sauce is perfect for dipping.  I've even had their breakfast burritos which are PACKED with eggs, bacon, and cheese.  If they could put it in a can, it could be packaged as a hangover cure and possibly the antidote for bird flu.  I also dig on their churros, which are not made in-house, but dammit, they are delicious anyway.  I usually get the strawberry-filled and afterwards I feel like i have violated the Geneva Convention for war crimes against my body.  Oh, they also mention on their signage that they are open 24 horas, but I'll never know because I'd never jaunt down here to this part of hood armed with only a lengua burrito.

Anyone who's ever floated in another state -- say one with less riverdouche than the one in AZ -- will agree that the Salt River is a very formidable fill-in for the ones back home.    Piggying onto Graham C's story, I was the poor schmuck who had his tube commandeered by a band of asian-indian pirates during a riverbed pish so as not to further pollute the Salado Fria with my 79% Lone Star Beer urine.  I floated helplessly until some other doofus left his/her tube unattended (presumably -- Graham or I tracked it for a good 10 minutes with nary a taker) and resumed the monkeyshines of our 20-strong floatparty.    This river can be a whole hell of a lot of fun, given that you gather a nice group of people who can contain their drunken obnoxiousness as you will be tied to them for 3, 4, or even 5 hours.  Luckily, I know JUST that amount of people.   If you adopt alternate eponyms like Party Gator, Magnus ver Magnusson, The Roanoakley, and Zizi Jeanmaire, all the better as no one you meet on the river who is not a member of your immediate party will be worth knowing in land-form and thus, your 'actual' name is a valuable keepsake so they won't find you on yelp and invite you to Dirty Pretty Rockbar or better yet, Eli's.  Tokens of advice:  Bring enough beer for at least 3 hours Sunscreen is your friend Don't wear flip flops unless you like your feet shanked (wear tennies) Bring rope to tie tubes together Don't forget the ziplock bags for your smokes  Its fun out there, but as others have said ... a once-a-year adventure.  And yes, it is clean *enough*.

In the style of Cormac McCarthy:  It was as pretty a night as he could remember out of a great plenty of such nights.  They stood on a rise of the pavement outside of 98 South.  Dinner was over.  She nudged a poignant finger outward.  She motioned to the aged structure lighted by lanterns manufactured to resemble something much older.  Inside of them burned incandescent bulbs instead of oil.            To the Winery?  the girl said.            Absolutely.            Good.    They enter and notice the smell of cooked meat.  Like roasted lamb.  Hunger was not a pressing issue so they ignore the olfactory coaxing.  A casket black book with a single leaflet is presented by a woman.  They rifle through the wine selections inside.              What is it?            Nothing.            See anything you like?            Nothing is capturing my interest.            Mine either.            I'll have the Zinfandel i guess.            Okay.            I think I'll have the Pinot.              Good.     They sit on the outdoor patio and notice the light dusting of antique decor.  Neither is sure of its authenticity.            How is your wine?            Its average.            Mine too.              Actually I don't really like it.            Far too peppery.  I wouldn't recommend the Zin.            Try it?            The girl drank it and handed it back            Drink some more.            You drink it.            Okay, finish yours quickly and lets go  They sat in the patio and looked out in the parking lot and the brewery beyond and the festive atmosphere within.               To the Brewery?  she said             You mean it?              Sure.  They couldn't get out of the winery quickly enough as they waded the foot traffic and four-cylinder cars through the parking lot as the night hummed in future mystery.

Scottsdale stadium is the best park in the Cactus League, and as a Cubs fan, I wish that we would have a 7 game series vs these wankers for the right to use this stadium.    Its proximity to the best day-drinking spots anywhere in the Valley is the primary reason to come to this particular stadium, because, well, who wants to see the Giants anyway?  The second best reason is that they import Bay Area-comforts like Anchor Steam, Pale Ale, and Northern Cali junk food.    The grass berm in the outfield is short, but if you can snag a spot, its fantastic for sightlines.

Referring  to Mickey's as a  "dive bar" is like referring to Princeton as a "secondary school".  Its a lazily, flaccid description for a bar with a fist-full of moxie.  Their Bloody Marys alone feature a fucking brawny-assed, gigantic totem pole of man-meat.  Well, not "man meat", but meat-fit-for-a-man.  You get the point.    Look, the main point is that no "dive bar" is gonna be serving yo ass peppers and salami in a $5 tomato Slurpee.    People often mistake "kitsch" as "obsolete"  and these these are the type of people who would use the word "psych!", and grease their side-hair back after swindling you into a fake low-five.    And i would like to agree with their lowly opinions of Mickey's, but then, I wouldn't want to be wrong also.  If you've ever been to Welcome to the Johnson's in the Lower East Side, and moreover, enjoyed yourself there, then Mickey's is your Arizona equivalent.  Think of it as, Welcome to the Merriweather's.  Scottsdale name, New York kitsch.    So, their bar service is kinda tough, but once there, they have a kickass selection of brews both ironic and sincere.  You want an Old Style followed by a Boddington's?  Where else but Mickey's?  Their kitchen is open late, which, for the love of all that is holy, is impossible to find in this three-bedroom-two-bath-house of a town.  Even better, their food is goooood.  I mean, heart palpitating good when you consider how delish bar food REALLY CAN be at 2 am.  No, it ain't Capital Grille, get over it, but their wings, fries, chix tenders, et all hit the f'ing spot when you've had too many Jamisons (or Jager/Patron shots for the resident middle schoolers).  They just recently seemed to have remodeled their patio, which looks really great, but lost most of its charm.  Still, space to move and a decent spot to smoke outside beats a macrame couch, or whatever, every day of the week.  Anyway.  I like this place.  They lose a star for making me pay $3 for a pretty tame DJ and for hosting Ohio State functions.  Fuck em.  Go Horns.

Sometimes you wish God, oh just this once, would grant you the power to reach right through your computer screen and smack some doofus on the other side.  Well, I've come to make this request to a higher power.  The negative reviews about The Rusty Spur make my head swim like it would after a pull of Mezcal straight from the bottle.   This place is tip-fucking-top.  You don't want to be pressured to tip the band?  Then pay a cover.  Would that make ya feel all better?  No cover to enjoy a genuine Texas (read: "real") country band?  Holy smokes, they will even do covers of Robert Earl Keen and Pat Green.  Go to any other shite bar in the city and ask them if they know that.    The place is tiny, which lends to its charm.  This place is STRAIGHT out of Luckenbach and these suburbanites don't even know the characteristics of an 'outlaw country' bar.  Waylon and Willie would be proud of this place.  Plus, they serve Shiner Bock in a bottle.  Unreal.    The dance floor, which is a misnomer, more like a shuffle floor is absolutely legit in accordance with the rules of a Texas dance hall, except for the fact that you bump into tables instead of only other dancers.  Go watch Urban Cowboy and tell me that you need your dance space.  Get over it.  .... and .... AND! ... "Beans" in the chili?  WTF?  This ain't Canada.  Hell, this aint even Ohio!  Beans should NEVER disgrace a proper pot of chili.  Jesus.  What the reviewer who mentioned that has just informed me is that they make their chili proper.  But I'd never know because I go in here to hoot n holler n get rowdy with the rest of the crowd ... drink a Shiner and dance a little two-step to Merle ... not stuff my face like a tourist.  Christ.  I'm in no way a regular here, but this place is one of the very few legitimate country bars, not only in Phoenix, but worldwide.  I've been in enough to know.  It should be regarded very highly for its genre.

I'll go back for another opportunity at a very nice glass of Petite Syrah and their famous Big Ass Burger (or whatever its called) while sitting at the bar in a very comfortable surrounding.  Something seemed very charming about eating bar-side in an upscale restaurant, chatting with the keep, fire roaring off in a corner, and well-dressed patrons enjoying celebratory or power-meeting meals like green chile pork stew, slow roasted pork prime rib, and Dr Pepper Braised Beef Short Ribs.    I like their wood-roasted concept and works well in its only two locations worldwide, downtown Scottsdale and downtown Austin.   I would personally have a big-time, celebratory event here as it is worthy of such an occasion, but also worthy of a nice little meal up on the bar.

If there is a chance at you catching a show here, then you should really jump at the chance due to the intimacy of the venue and their ability to score the occasional mid-level act.  I've seen several acts here, including Phoenix and Bob Schneider and although crowded, it was awesome due to stage proximity.    I cannot imagine another reason to visit this place other than to see a show, cos things like 'cover' and 'curtained booths' and 'mashup djs' should be enough to turn you right around.  Also, I find something sinister and disturbing about 'chain nightclubs'.

If this place doesn't serve as a case study of what "wasted opportunity" and "terrible management" looks like, then show me another place like Sugar Daddy's that frighteningly resembles Chernobyl 1986.  I chuckle now because several times, years ago, I would wait in a line to get into this place -- not on my own accord, mind you -- but because some of my buddies thought this place was the killer.  In fact, this place would be freaking AWESOME if it was plopped down on 3rd Street and Roosevelt.  But it had two major things working against it: 1) Their kickarse patio faces the lame part of Scottsdale Road, and 2) Their kickarse property is in the lame part of Scottsdale Road.  Granted, I still wouldn't go if this place was set in Old Town, but at least they wouldn't be gasping for air while the distant, populated beach of Goldwater shrugs a casual shoulder.  This place just takes 'whats wrong with the Scottsdale bar scene' to another level.  They actually started this genus of bars and moved it further along the street to Loco Patron, which, conveniently enough for those vertical-striped sharks without a tank, is the slightly less crippled version of Sugar Daddy's.

"Anyone going to Zipp's intending a culinary masterpiece deserves what they get, and thats likely a sad little Scottsdale frown.  One should go to Zipp's because of their kickass patio, complete with a fire pit and TVs at every imaginable angle in which to view games -- even if you are the last in your party to arrive and get stuck with the worst seat at your table.    The managers are always willing to switch it to the game you're interested in as well and don't give you the same kind of haughty shit that other sports bar managers do when you ask them to alter their precious programming schedule.  The food is good, for bar food of course, although i don't venture out very far past their Hot Wings.  They have really good beer on tap too -- nothing else quite like a 32oz. Alaskan Amber and some college basketball.  I would have to say that, as an avid sports fan who really tries to avoid watching important sporting events outside of my comfort zone (re: living room), Zipp's is the only place I will let host my antics."

The set-up is completely bizarre for a show where the typical divisive practices of club-owners bottleneck the 'kiddie section' dead center in front of the stage, which is the 'no-fly zone' for alcohol.    This arrangement sets up the now-famous 'awkward 20 foot gap' between showpiece and fully-anticipatory-audience who is inebriated enough to dance and cheer instead of the tweener crowd in full cross-armed bashful gawkiness.  The drinking audience is so colossally detached from the musical climate of the show that it is truly insignificant whether or not they actually attended.    I went here with Graham C and Natalie G to see Voxtrot and Au Revoir Simone and all of  this foolishness climaxed when the three bandmates from ARS had to break the 21 and under barrier just to show headliners Voxtrot some love by peacocking around the dance floor in the general vicinity of the band.  No one else was willing to give up their beers to participate.  There is generally no alternative options when presented with the venue of  choice where a band you wanna hear is playing  ... but if its a band you only 'kinda wanna hear', its not really worth the hassle or boredom.  There's really no excuse for a club owner to have a crummy live music venue.  Those are simple dynamics to work out.

My fiancee and I visited Lon's at the Hermosa on a Friday night in June to celebrate our anniversary and was a perfect location for a little romance under the calm, star-cloaked Arizona sky in a pocket of wilderness within the sprawling Phoenix metro.   Lon's provided one of the most inspired meals I've had in quite a while, beginning expeditiously with a world-class wine list, representative of various renowned grape-squeezing regions as the Pacific Coast, Italy, France, Argentina, Chile, Spain, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand.  After a quick consult with a very capable sommelier who spirited us with an impressive explanation of Portuguese reds, we agreed on a bottle on Golfo [?], which may or may not be the correct name, as it smartly inoculated us after two and a half glasses each.  Mmm!  In place of a starter, we ordered two unique salads: Mine was a seared duck salad on baby greens with toasted pine nuts an a white vinaigrette.  It was ingenious ... but not quite as ingenious as the scallop salad my fiancee had.  They were absolutely the best-prepared scallops either of us had ever experienced.  What is even more amazing is that the salads were surpassed in flavor by the entrees, which sometimes flops as a headliner to gourmet starters.  Not the case here.  My sun dried tomato crusted rack of lamb was prepared excellently and the crust paired with the tender, juicy lamb chops (4) was easily skyrocketed into the top 3 list of things I've ever tasted.  The goat cheese herb grits were a perfect, and light compliment .. and something I've truly never seen on a menu before, much less experienced by taste.    My fiancee's grilled filet of salmon with blackberry barbeque glaze was very much an original as well.  Even for someone who is not a gigantic fan of salmon, such as myself, really enjoyed the complexity of flavors.  She very much enjoyed it.  For dessert, we had the sorbet sampler as a means of cooling off from our frenetic eating/drinking pace.  Although very delicious, it was a mistake on my part as there was a sampler of tiramasu/creme brulee/pote de chocolate.  Ugh.  What was I thinking bypassing this delicious plate of hyperglycemia?  Well, there's always next time.  It also must be noted, the stellar service we received.  The server was absolutely charming, gracious, and accommodative, referring to us by name, refilling our water/wine glasses, and supervising small touches like fetching the sommelier and informing the pastry chef that it was our anniversary [with that information, they gave us a chocolate script 'Happy Anniversary' on our dessert plate - nice touch].  Overall, it was a place worthy of a very special occasion, and one which I would not hesitate to return to so that we can experience the rest of their impressive menu.

About the only pock i can punch into Papago's reputation is their pizza.  While its not really that bad, I expected MUCH better from a place that delights the senses in every way.  Their Orange Blossom Hefe is mental.  I'm not even a very big fan of Hefe, but this stuff is on point. They also consistently have a Porter, which is my favorite.  Then you can pull one of their bottled beer outta their fridge, take it up to the counter to have them pop the cap, and have at it.  Its a killer concept when you can't wait for the waitress to give you the go on a Lost Coast, or whatever.  Also, they have Beamish on tap, which maybe one or two other places in Arizona have on tap.  Certainly not places that should have it *cough*SeamusandRula*clearsthroat*  Sometimes if find bar decor really hokey, and though they play up their Belgian theme, it really looks great here.  With their giant monk overlooking his abbey and the aged picnic tables as gathering spots, the feeling is that you are in a tavern in Liege and not the world's snootiest suburb.  I might also add that their tent at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival is the dominant one of the lot.

Come and meet the letter people!  Come and visit the family!  Words are made of letter people!  ABCD follow me ....  Today meet Mr F!  Fried f'ing pickles, finicky friends!  This place can fill your fix of finger foods, especially if you fantasize about f'ing downing forty of this fabulous fare with their fantastic fancy remoulade fixing!  Sure, other food and fun can be found at this foundation, but freakin A, fried fucking pickles are the fundamental reason for frequenting this fencepost.    Fancy a pint and a footy match?  Fish and fries (fine, chips)?  BOP's got a few of your fantasies covered.    Its your fault if your feet aren't the first in the queue for this friendly pub.  Four stars!

I can't say enough about how great of a happy hour spot this is, other than in my pretentiousness about living central, i will drive the half hour in awful traffic to partake in the coldest St Pauli Girl in the valley and eat amazingly delicious half-priced fresh seafood appetizers.   OK, so happy hours should be cheap, and this one is C-H-E-A-P-E-R than if you actually ate at the restaurant portion and not the bar, but if you dive into all of the apps like i do, it will add up very quickly.  Still, the bar itself has so much character and being in the deep Arizona soil makes this place otherworldly on a hot Phoenix afternoon.  Careful, emerging back up to the surface will bite -- what with all that seafood and previously mentioned St Pauli Girl.  This place is GREAT, and looking forward to eating a real meal here in their actual dining room.

Face it everybody.  We live in a soul-less, paved-over, mercilessly blistering, cultural wasteland.  I want to be reluctant to admit it as well, but its true.  But every now and again you find something to ease the pain of Valley dwelling and Rogue bar is the band-aid.  Its strange seeing this place transform from straight dive with cheap PBR back in the early 00's, to a lounge spot with a FANTASTIC jukebox, to the trendy, indie-bar-of-the-second.  And strangely, i feel like I've grown with it.  Sure there are the staples, the cheap beer, the amazing music, the unique clientle, but the additions -- DJs, the bartenders, the precocious vibe -- all have transformed Rogue into the most vibrant spot in the valley.    If I were to host guests from London, NY, SF, Seattle, or Austin, Rogue is the only place i wouldn't apologize beforehand for its potential lame-ness (edit: nor would i apologize for Casey's -- the perfect tandem night!)  Oh, also, i LERVE the negative reviews about Rogue -- keep em coming.  It wouldn't be quite right if everyone "got it" about this joint.

I'm not particularly fond of their beer, but I think its the 3rd best that the Valley has to offer behind Popago and Sonoran ... however, what it lacks in beer quality, and I must say its only a small leap down in quality from those other two ... it makes up for in atmosphere, which is leagues better than either of their competitors.  I actually prefer their bottled beer rather than their "fresh outta the keg" variety, which is good for them seeing as I'm more likely to pick out their product at Safeway than I am to visit the Tempe location due to proximity.  On a related note, however, their House Brew that they make especially for The Roosevelt is my second favorite local brew behind Popago's Orange Blossom.  Patio seating is a premium here in the Valley, and the fact that Four Peaks blended a warehouse motif into a sunny front porch SCREAMS Seattle's Pioneer Square without the dismal rain.  This place is actually the first place most of my out-of-town guests request to visit when coming to Phoenix.  I always thought that was a nice compliment for Four Peaks.

"Gordon Biersch Swillery & Franchise"  There, fixed it for them.  These people need to be hit in the nuts with empty bottles of Anchor Steam and about the neck and chest with full bottles of Shiner Bock.  Take your restaurant concept to Chandler and bug out of the best piece of real estate on Mill Ave.

I'm not gonna bite the hand that feeds ... Sure, Marquee could use some serious upgrades and curb all of that goose-stepping Junior Arpaio Youth Camp bullshit ... but they are bringing most of the indie acts to the Valley that I'm hungry for.  I've seen everything from folksy act Sufjan Stevens (with chairs) to twee act Of Montreal (sans chairs) to electronica act Air (sans face, melted off), etc. and each time its been a pleasant concert-attending experience.  As is typical of my reviews, I liked it better when smoking was permitted -- Come on, Damon Gogh without a fag in hand?? -- it just doesn't seem right in an indie music venue.  But their patio is suitable for drinking and taking a mid-show break, even if it IS pretty rag-tag.    As mentioned by others, the drink prices are average, but they do have a pretty good selection for a music venue.  It says they are focused on making the beer lover happy, and not just forcing their hand on a $6 miller light.  Overall, I'm pretty pleased with this place.  Its easy to get in and out of and is in a good Valley location right off the 202 with Tempe looming as a pre-drinks destination.

It would be difficult for any of us who haven't been to Ethiopia or have experience with a variety of Ethiopian cafes (maybe if you're from DC you could qualify) to be a stringent critic on the quality of Lalibela, but what I DO know is what tastes stunning regardless of a specific palate for niche-ethnic-food.  Based on the savory deliciousness of the Lalibela Exclusive -- a party platter consisting of [doro wat, kye sega wat, alicha sega wat, misir wat, gomen, yebere sega tibs, fosolia, yebeg alicha sega wat, tikil gomen and yekik alicha served with ayeb and selata] uhm, food n stuff that you use to envelope with a sourdough-like flatbread made of teff flour, I will gladly hand over the coveted five-star rating.  The platter had various meats -- beef, chicken, and lamb -- as well as lentils, beans, greens and herbs.  The vegans (level 4 - heh.) were able to share the meal along with the carnis without a complaint.  Between 6 of us we took down 1.5 platters.  The daunting task of finishing it all off was too much for us to handle, but i had no problem downing my Ethiopian light beer "Harar", which was honey-sweet and tasty and made for a perfect punch to wash all that culture down.

Rula Bula is the Mike Piazza of Irish pubs.    You see, back in 1988, Piazza was the LAST player drafted by the LA Dodger in the 62nd round.  The 1390th pick overall.  One-fucking-thousand-three-hundred-and-ninetieth.  And many say that even THAT was a stretch and purportedly done as a favor from his childhood friend and Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda.  But Mike got to the majors and kicked some major ass to become the best slugging catcher ever and a 12-time All Star.  And that is the same story of how our little Irish spot on Tempe's Mill Ave came to the Bigs and started wrecking shop.  A number of years ago, when it started, it was a pretty drab, boring place.  Then they got their shit together, hosted some Irish folk bands, and renovated their backyard.  They started distancing themselves from frat bar to autonomous Irish pub and improved their drinks selection.  Then, they revealed these out-fucking-standing fish and chips combo which slotted them for the All-Stars of little-pub-who-could, underdog perseveres status.   Give me Varitek and his Irish pub up in Beantown, and I'll put Rula up against his without blinking.  Rula is THAT good.

There needs to be a grip-load more places like this one around the valley, where they make you feel like whatever dogfood they deliver to you on your plate, you're gonna gladly pay the fee with a toothy smile on your face and say 'thank-you good sir', and 'yes, i will kindly see a dessert menu'!  Why this kind of restaurant/vibe hasn't been exploited ad infinitum here in the valley is pretty taxing on the brain.    It would be silly for me to review and report my dinners here ... I INSIST you browse the menu and try to explain 'why' you wouldn't visit here for a semi-formal event.  http://www.houseoftricks.com/New%20Dinner%20Menu%203-12-08.pdf

There are few experiences in the sporting world that are analogous to a religious experience; a world cup final at Wembley, Game 7 at The House Ruth Built,  an NFC championship in blustery Green Bay, the 50 yard line cut-off between Orange and Crimson at a Texas-ou game in Fair Park, The 18th at Augusta, The Old Garden in Boston ... and ...  Spring Training in Arizona.  Hope springing eternal like a vernal seed, watching it in faces as the new season dawns and everyteam is hedged in first place, like a row of champion thoroughbreds at the gates.  Sharing this moment with 11,000 fellow Cubbie fans on an afternoon workday is ethereal.  While, you *could* park yourself in the shady box-seats behind home, wherein would lie the adventure?    For 6 measly cucumbers, you can have the "greener" version of the notorious rooftop seating at the 'friendly confines', drink Old Style out of a can, and gorge yourself with italian sausages while slow-roasting your winter-pale skin on the plush berm in right or left field.    Don't like baseball?  So fucking what? Here are some quick quips for inbetween pitches and long sips of cold beer:  Who was that E5 on?   Do you think Wood will make the opening day roster?   Do you wanna get the next round, or me?   Yank him out, Lou!! Bring me back some nachos, eh?  Is that Kosuke Fukudome on deck?   There will never be another Harry Caray. Yo, can you get me another beer, I'll get next?    Nevermind what any of those actually mean, or actually responding to whatever is said in retaliation.  Just lay your elbows back.  Enjoy that free round on your quickly reddening, formerly pasty, and just scarily burnt friend.    Oh, and learn how to pronounce Fukudome.

Caffe Boa is about as exciting as bulk trash pickup day.  The service is so bad it makes the Terminal 4 baggage claim at Sky Harbor look like its staffed by nothing but Jackie Chan clones.  Thats means Boa is slooooooow, folks.  I'm befuddled by the mystery of their menu, trying to discern if what beautiful items I appeared to order are actually what's in front of me.  Ogerp Pasta?  Oh, yeah, i get it.  Its Prego cleverly spelled backwards.  Next on the list Etnom Led Asparagus (apparently, some region in Tuscany).  People are always up on their shit about their happy hour, which I makes my eyes roll right out of my head, because:  1)  Their bar is about as big as a Subaru Vivio. 2)  Their specials ONLY apply when sitting in the Vivio. 3)  There are certainly no helpful chauffeurs.    Fortunately for me, its pretty far out of the way, which makes it almost certain that I can have some excuse for not driving all the way to Tempe to be spared to death.

Casey's is probably the bar I've been to the most since I've lived in the Valley, and although its seen me through many phases of growth along my twenties and in the full spectrum of sobriety, it has remained so reassuringly consistent.  I started coming here while still in grad school at ASU in 2000 and I was hooked by the best patio in the Valley and the eclectic mix of people indie, students, yups (.... the sportos, the motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, waistoids, dweebies, dickheads  ... okay, that last part was from Ferris Beuller).    There is no better mesh of drinkers in the valley than you will find at Casey's.  Its a comfortable place for everyone to come and drink.  Heck, i even had my after-graduation reception here with a bunch of family and out-of-towners who really enjoyed the atmosphere, drinks and food as well.  Its a place to come for day drinking, happy hour, special events (St Paddy's), early evening, pre-concert, late night, and last call. Its good to take your date or your best friend or even the fam.  If you like beer, its your spot, if you like the hard stuff, its your spot.  It is truly "the perfect bar".  Oh, and you can always count on this place being "alive" because something that really fucks me up about the Valley are the lack of people drinking in bars I'm at ... and that kind of atmosphere tends to suck all the life out of the evening.

I promise you.  I.  promise.  you.  These are the best burritos (note: calling a 'burrito' a 'burro' is dumb and only prevalent in PHX) in town.  They are bigger than a baby's arm and have very moist chicken throughout.  The 'Crudo burro' with rice and beans plate is CRIMINALLY INSANE.  Their salsa comes in a squeeze bottle, which i love because of the regulatory physics behind squirting delicious red salsa onto a burrito bite-by-bite.  They also have churros, which is ALWAYS a plus for me because I'm crazy about them for dessert.  Prices are slightly steeper than your typical neighborhood Mexican joint and they DO have a drive-thru, which you must call ahead for, then pick up at the window.

This place rocks the block.  And SoPho *needs* to rock out every now and again.  Their donuts destroy anything that Dunkin Donuts cooks, or boils, up.  They aren't into that silly cake-donut fad, as DD has seemed to have fully endorsed.  Sure you can get them there, but its not their entire inventory.    Personally, i love the cherry frosted, which has tit-jabbed the strawberry frosted right off the top of my list of favorites.  Mmmm!  Their coffee is JUST right and is freshly brewed very frequently, you can just taste it.  As a topper, their prices are so ridiculously cheap, I always feel bad using my debit card thinking they must have to pay some sort of banking fee.    I try to spend at least $5 to make up for it, but two donuts and a coffee doesn't even add up to that ... plus, I won't make myself feel too bad for fear of becoming a fat and fleshy bargain-donut-hunter.  I don't know how many of you hang out in SoPho, but if you ever see yourself scoring a dime bag, swing by Donut Central while you're at it for some sweet munchies!

Now THIS is how an arena should be built; the steep constuction of its grandstands and mezz, the numerous lux boxes ringing the ice inbetween, the club areas below the arena floor and behind the goal, the magnificent sightlines and the Canadian beer.    If Phoenix ever 'got into' hockey, they would really appreciate how loud this barn could get.  Its architecture is custom built for noise and intimidation, as it lends the feeling of fans hovering over the rink.  The transformation into music hall is actually quite impressive given that large arenas are life-sponges for touring acts.    My only complaint is the sleepy, conformed bedroom community in which it was built.  Glendale couldn't be more sterile and boring if they replaced it with Pensacola, Florida.  The drive out here kills any attempts at a rowdy, drunken night of hockey or nationalgnarlyrockband, due to the impending day-trip back to civilization from the arena; and the ridiculous name befitting of its lame, corporate surrounding and immediate, and similarly foolishly monicker'ed neighbor to the west.

Oh.  I kinda feel like a tourist after reading some of the other reviews here, but there is no denying that this place is badass.    Shoot, any place that serves mason jars of homebrew, presented by a gruff, female bartender is kool-n-the-gang in my hypercritical mind.  Though, the only place I can imagine getting the full value of this spot is up on the teetering, wobbly stools along the long-worn wooden bar.  Don't be afraid to light up a square, as smoking actually appears to be encouraged here.  Score one for the bourgeoisie!  I was most impressed with their Bock beer, which I happened to go apey over, since brewing Bock and serving it at a friendly watering establishment is a genuinely got-damn rare event, so i had a few of those.  It was good.  Slightly thinner than the normal Bock I drink, but tasty nonetheless.    I didn't try the food, and to be honest, I don't know why one would come here expecting anything other than crappy Az-Mex, but people were eating it and seemed sated by it.    IMO, just come here to catch some sunset/evening brews before or after you hit up El Encanto.

I'm about as gay as Samuel L Jackson, but Amsterdam is inviting for heteros too.  I've been here at happy hour, where I *think* they have some drink specials (its so hard to keep track of my tab these days ... or ... perhaps I'm being roofie'd there.  *blink*).  They have a pretty creative drinks menu that i don't really dabble too deeply in, but i love their Guiness/Hefewiezen half-n-half, their Bloody Hefe, and their house Raspberry Beer & Guiness halfer.      The back patio is cool, but its theme seems out of place with the rest of the bar, namely, the gaudy decor and cherrywood of the main bar.  We went on a Friday night recently with my gf and some other friends, and if you go with the right people, you will have a killer time dancing and drinking wild shit.  I had some kind of pomegranate (which is, along with cranberry, the femme fruit of choice) drink that i was really feelin and with some JTL* on the decks ... it was a kickassfuckintime.     *Rock Your Body

When you reach the passover from double, to triple digit reviews, you want the century marker to be something notable and worthy.  Where else could commemorate a 100th review than Pizzeria Bianco?  The secret to Bianco is really quite simple:  Have kickass friends.    What I mean is, have friends who will call you mid-evening, and bless you with the great news that they have enrolled in Bianco prison, and would you kindly meet them for dinner in a few hours after the NCAA basketball games have finished and maybe after a little self-primping in front of the bedroom mirror?  Why, yes!  So, addressing the exhaustively discussed subject of wait time, having done both the hard-time and the soft-wait outside of Bianco, I have to say, "just get over it".  Is anything worth waiting two, three, four hours for?  Yes.  UT national championship football tickets. A reunion Smiths show at the Hammersmith Apollo.  A plane ride to Seattle.  And Bianco Pizza.  What I'm trying to illustrate is, you are there for the experience.  The wait, the wine, the conversation, rinse, repeat.  Eventually, you will get into the gorgeous early-century brick general-store-esque building and feel like you've accomplished something.  Don't be a bitch about it.  This is the highest quality slice you will likely ever have, and though some will argue the necessity for the buildup, you will never have the same dining experience anywhere else.  Moreover, any place equally hyped and ballyhoo'd, will leave your wallet hundreds of dollars lighter.  Bianco does not.  So, when the waiter came, and my gf and I finished off our delightful $9 Sangiovese (from Arizona, nonetheless -- hint: this is a RAAAAARE varietal for our state), we observed that they had Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale (from Sedona).  An absolutely PERFECT brown ale, far FAR better than Newcastle or anything Four Peaks could brew up (the secret is in the superior Sedona water).  My gf got that one, and of course out-selected me.  Instead, I had the Mirror Pond Ale from Bend, Oregon .. a superior brew that represents the promised land of micro-brew very appropriately.  Both were highly complimentary beers for our impending pizza dinner.  For our pizza selection, we chose the Rosa (the must-try for Bianco n00bs) and the margherita with prosciutto added on top.  The Rosa, as usual was outstanding, but the margherita/prosciutto was absolutely fucking phenomenal.  I couldn't get over how delicious this creation was and as a self-aggrandizing foodie, it was truly the best pizza I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.  Please do yourself a favor, loyal reader, and give consideration to this option upon next visit.  Overall, I could not dream of giving Bianco anything less than a solid 5 star rating.  Look, I gag and eye-roll about overhyped goods like any other would.  A band?  If they've been out longer than 5 minutes, released anything longer than an EP, or have had a showcase at SXSW, hell, they're way to overexposed for my taste.  A football team?  I hate USC for no reason.  And so on.  Bianco doesn't deserve similar criticism.  Go for the oddity and hype, but stay because you have the sense to appreciate a remarkable overall experience.

Hey, its difficult to find anything particularly wrong with this stadium, which is especially remarkable coming from an obstinate sports fan who intends to hate before he loves.    Immediate impressions of the stadium are that it is very well-designed and constructed with fan comfort in mind.  Chase nails this aspect solidly.  The concourse are rife with eating and drinking options.  You literally cannot walk 10 steps without tasty, delicious stadium food beckoning your fat ass to indulge; polish dogs, ice cream, 24 oz. bottled beer; Peter fucking Piper Pizza (Mmmmmm!).  The concourse also opens up brilliantly into the field of play, and one can go take a break from the seats but still have the ability to watch the action on the field.  Very important feature, particularly with baseball where sitting down can become monotonous.    The actual field of play is marvelously constructed, with modern and classic designs colliding.  The dirt path from the mound to the plate is a throwback to the 30s, while the pool in the outfield adds a very unique and "Arizona" touch.  Pretty damn cool.  The classic clockface in centerfield is beautiful, and the grade of the stands are perfect for the noise to reflect off the metal structure.  Now that its under new management, they are opening the roof much more, which is a HUGE plus.  Many fans have been complaining about the lack of open air since the stadium opened.  So two things that I don't like about the stadium, one ornamental, the other functional.    First, the hokey, 90s-esque mosaic on the outfield slats.  Jesus.  How about an update?  Its just looks so fucking bad, its almost embarrassing, and has prevented the outside of this architectural masterpiece from aging with grace.  How about HUUUGE pictures of current players, or true windows to let the light in and perhaps a view of the distant skyline?  This would require, of course, for PHX to actually knock down the Garage Mahal and actually build an outfield skyline.  This leads me to problem #2, the aforementioned "Garage Mahal", the most deplorable, atrocious boner yet for our mentally-ill city planners and officials.  What a total fucking waste to build the most useless and overly enormous parking garage that ultimately discourages people from walking through downtown before and after the game, restricted the potential for bars and restaurants to be placed there instead (fuck, they didn't even give the option for ground level retail), and mostly sits at 1% capacity on non-baseball-days.  That would be 284 days of uselessness.    Though this isn't the D-backs fault, it is a result of stadium proximity, so as a penalty, combined with those silly mosaics, it loses a star and red pigment.  Overall, however, Chase field is the tits and will eventually be a MLB classic.

The two things that jettison my brain into a Barrio Cafe daydream are:  1)  The Sangrita 2)  The Churro dessert  In fact, if this place was called "Barrio Sangrita and Churro Shop", i would still want to run up to the building and give it a big hug.  Really, enough has been said here about the food, or atmosphere, or whatevs ... but if they're hoping to leave a legacy in Phoenix, its with these two items.  I prefer going to BC for brunch on Sunday.  I enjoy that menu the best.  Oh, and the table side Guac is a nice touch.

Good God, I hate this place.  Its one thing to dork out about your product, but to go over-the-top with it is just unnecessary.  What I mean is, they  make their food so fucking spicy, I want to punch myself in the balls in an attempt to disperse the pain throughout my entire body rather than letting it linger in the locus of angry hornets that have nested in my mouth.  And yes, I love spicy Mexican food.  I grew up in a border town for Christo's sake.  This IS NOT Mexican food.  Its a gimmick.  Genuine Mexican food is supposed to be subtle in heat and grow throughout the dish.  One should be able to taste the layered spices and complex ingredients.  Mexican food takes a lot of effort and time to make and should be complimented by a thorough savoriness by the consumer.    Their food must suck, but you'd never know it because it is so fully disguised by the Dos Molinos people, who drop a nuclear bomb on your head and ask you if you want to order another Dos XX.  My only compliment is the patio and the fact that they serve Mexican beer, which we all know is the cure for radioactive exposure.

Picture this:    You timidly stroll into 'The Yard' at Leavenworth, abated, as fresh meat.  You pause.  Cautiously spinning around, you noticed you are being gawked at, judged, mulled, and brooded by others.  You audaciously, head over to the bench press, unveil your biceps through your wife beater, stack two 45s on each side ...  ... and then the drum and bass music begins.     So goes AZ 88.  The Bar as The Yard.  The Socialites are The Felons.  The Vertical Striped Uniforms portraying the Horizontal Striped Uniforms.  And the bench press is your financial cache.  All of this is precisely why I love this place.  It is like entering the world's most cosmopolitan penitentiary during visiting hours, where you get to enjoy the fascinating aspects of a sad existence and still, they let you leave afterwards, retreating to your happy, humble life in the clear.  All the while, you can enjoy some fantastic waffle fries and a Moscow Mule and sit in the cozy furniture on the other side of the glass not intended for the habitue.  Yes, in fact, AZ88 IS a fun time, as long as one doesn't make it his hard-knock life.   Visit occasionally.  They have unique drinks in an unusual environment.  House DJs and a cleverly ironic menu to wrinkle the expectations of it all.  Just be cogent not to get absorbed into the S'dale lifers.

Look, your family consists of hard-to-please, cranky, cheap, drunken, indecisive, peevs who would just as soon hop on a plane back to Clifton, Iowa than have dinner with you ... but your parents like em, and hell, mom and pop are paying for you to have a little din-din while the entire fam is visiting little ol' you in Phoenix, Arizona.  Luckily, Oregano's will help you with your little problem.  They've got wine, oh yeah.  And at a great price.  They've got an large, open waiting area with comfy seats.  They've got a cozy setting hidden just off of a bustling avenue.  And they've got the kind of food that can please everyone.  That means everyone from your crotchety grandfather who hasn't dined out since the 60s to your Mountain Dew infused punk of a cousin who likes to urinate on animals.    Here ya go.  I really REALLY like their lasagna (though not good for group dining cos it takes 45 mins, yo) and I want to marry their garlic bread.  Sharing pizza is good all around, and the presentation is nice.  When you get to the Pizzookie, you know you've done your best to keep familial relations on good terms for at least another year, or until you're dining at the Des Moines Shoney's next Christmas Eve.

Can you be a member of PHX yelp having NOT reviewed Delux?  This is like being jumped into Los Yelpes Gigantes.  Since Delux has been reviewed consistently for over two years, there is nothing that I can offer as a varied opinion, but i thought, what the hell?  I don't stop breathing air just cos everyone else has already done it.  Some things are necessary.  Delux is like your all-time favorite song.  Sure, you've had it over and over again, you know its intricacies, you've interpreted, and digested its offerings.  And then something happens that shocks you.  You get sick of it.  So, you stash it away, lose it on your memory's playback, and banish it from your favorite playlist.  Sometime later, it comes up again, and you think ... "Oh yeahhhh!"  This is Delux.    So you go back, get your usual pint of Anchor Steam, your maytag burger, and the halfer of sweet potato/boring potato fries.  Then you wonder why you ever shunned it.    This shit is great.  I won't ever dismiss it again.  Pretty soon, it will be a classic and you'll hear everyone talk stories about it, how they were there in 1972 when Delux opened for The Kinks.

Being in the fortuitous position to still 'get' a Spring Break, and moreover, get PAID cash-money to sit on my happy ass whilst my pen-salesman-esque  friends do important things in their offices, like make fake Wiki entries of their co-workers and cruise just barely SFW sites, i decided to buck my usual trend of waiting for something magnificent on the toob like Gailic Rules Football on Setanta or maybe even a little afternoon "drinking game Family Feud" and treck on over to Phoenix's most alluring dromedary.    Fuck me.  It was harder than I ever thought.  Those Bic bitches that are my friends apparently scale this shit like Doctor Octopus in their free time after work, and here I am with my seldom-used Nalgene bottle pushing my 190 pound frame up a very large vertical fucking rock like a goddam broken-legged donkey.  My unfairly fit girlfriend is doing cartwheels and all kinds of shit up the mountain and I'm waving her ahead, bound to my ship like Captain Smith on the sinking Titanic; "Go ahead ... can't move ... leave me here ... go ... dying."    Of course, after countless pre-teens and lawyer types with their kerchiefed labradors bounce right by me, I decide to pulley myself up using a carefully constructed mechanism that included my camera-string, a small boulder, and the aforementioned Nalgene bottle loop.  I navigate most of the way up, i think, before my better half comes waving down the mountain.  All hope for an Everest-like heroic push gone, I make my way back down again, promising to make up for my misgivings at Happy Hour, which I do.    My epic failure to summit, what amounts to a boulder in the hiking world, has led me to curse Camelback from my balcony vantagepoint, mocking me in the smoggy distance like Moby Dick to my Ishmael.    Still, it was pretty cool and can't wait to go back!

Its easy to get into an Us vs Them, West Downtown vs East Downtown, Cibo vs Bianco pissing match, but truly these places are so unique and valuable in their own way as to coexist in a culturally void downtown in a soulless metro.    Cibo, however, does indeed take the lead by a very significant stretch over Bianco.    First and very much FOREMOST, the owners are absolute treasures.  They have never been anything less than engaging, charming, and overtly polite.  Whether my gf and I eat there or take out, they always greets us as friends and seem to be genuinely appreciative of our business.  On one visit when i was with a large party of about 10-12 people we kinda had to squeeze into a small area in the front room, which was still quaint and comfortable, but i made an offhand joke after the owner looked concerned about my smallish seat, that she could "make it up to me with a beer".  I was completely embarrassed as she REALLY DID bring me a Celebration Ale on the house.  She's just an awesome lady.  Their building itself is enamoring with a large patio for the pleasant autumn nights of Phoenix and their interior is very cozy for a more subtle dinner.  The restaurant can be both romantic or merry.    Their tiny bar is perfect for a short wait (never waited longer than 5-10 mins at most), especially during take out where we like to enjoy their Sangiovese Chianti blend.   Their pizza itself is delicious.  The Rustica is my go-to and they tend to use generous amounts of meat and cheese (the prosciutto being my favorite).  Their portions are perfect for two people and are well-informed on how many pizzas will be 'just enough' for your party.  Also, their marscapone/Nutella crepes are insanely good.  If you ever have a chance to host an event, see if they will let you use their carriage house in the back, where, come to find out after we used it for our own holiday party, had a "recent tenant".  Lucky dude to have Cibo as a neighbor.    The back carriage house has a wine bar and a private server as well as a small patio for outside drinking/smoking.  Cibo is a perfect little neighborhood pizzeria.

First of all.  March right over to the hostess and put your name in for the outside patio.  The back yard setting in this Arcadia restaurant is seemingly perfect all year round, with their giant oaks (?) for shade during the sunny months, and a large, wood-burning, brick chiminea for those ten-or-so cold days of the year.  The outside is outrageously cozy.  And when you're back here, it doesn't really matter all that much how *good* the food is.  Oh, please believe, its pretty damn good and cooked very well, but in this setting, a Betty Crocker Mug-o-Lunch would taste like a Thomas Keller creation.  I've spent birthdays and NYE and Friday night, pre-festivities dinners here and each has been unique with varying menus ... something I've always appreciated; progressive restaurants who employ confident chefs willing to expand their craft without alienating their core patrons.    I won't recommend a dish.  Its all good.  The desserts are charming too [read: the sundae].  What I am recommending to you is the setting.  You can't go awry.

I don't have any beef with Carly's like most downtown do, but if you don't get to this place on the right night -- that is not too crowded on FF or not too sparse on most other nights -- than you certainly WILL have some.  Sure, the service is spotty, but i think it comes off as amiable rather than hoity.  Its staff, mostly herbal-crunchy women likely daydreaming about vegetables, is sweet and in their defense, are pretty hamstrung by their duties of preparing the food, attending to the tables, AND bartending.    My only qualm with Carly's is the fact that they often run out of my favorite things like the Organic Sammy Smith, which they NEVER seem to have anymore, but here's BIG LOVE to the fact that they now serve Austin's own Tito's Handmade Vodka.    Do yourself a favor and try this out if you are a vodka fan -- its made of yellow corn and is distilled six times ... it also won the double gold medal at the World's Spirits Competition beating out over 70 other high-end vodkas and won the only four-star ranking that year.

A one-two punch of drinking the day away at a Cubs spring training game, then in the lazy, shaded courtyard of Greasewood Flat pretty much makes Arizona feel like kingdom come, with the proviso that The Maker is heavy into the rustic western ranch theme.    Three of us came here on a Thursday afternoon, and saddled up to a picnic bench built for a thousand.  We ordered two cocktails (ginger ale vs. whiskey) and a Pacifico, which came out to a humble $9.50 a round.  Naturally, this lead to the preservation of our drink order through rounds 2-7.    After about an our of enjoying our space there in the front patio and loading the jukebox up with Bob Marley, Dave Matthews Band, Johnny Cash, Counting Crows, and Tom Petty, the tourists started to roll in, so that by sunset, the place was rife with atmosphere and the seedlings of rowdiness.    The cowboy in the white hat commandeered the small stage and twanged his way through Willie, Buffet, and Janis covers.  Fellow revelers began to mimic our private barrel fire, which my homegirls procured from Greasewood supplied chopped wood and a little East Valley Tribune.  Fire raging, cool booze in hand, and sated by the culinary offering of quarterpound bacon cheeseburgers, we were feeling like settlers of the New Old West, not very far from the New New West of Sprawlsdale, Arizona.

*** Do not go for anything other than Saturday/Sunday brunch and early evening drinks unless you enjoy overpaying for drab food and you love disappointment. ***  That was for the "short reviews" crowd as that will be the central theme of this review and the most important point when discussing Cafe ZuZu, which is the gorgeous space inside of the Hotel Valley Ho.  ZuZu's brunch is absolutely fantastic, rife with comfort foods and thick cut bacon and midwestern-inspired dishes from kitchens with rosy colored grandmothers.  Its what I would imagine, in the matter of setting, decor and nourishment, Frank Lloyd Wright would sit down to every morning and gaze out into the world.  In the case of Cafe ZuZu, one is able to watch out of the glass paned wall into the area of the 50s inspired patio and pool area.  The bloody mary is very serviceable.  Not the best I've ever had, but very delicious to go along with fruit topped french toast.  And again, that bacon!  After brunch long passes, is another good time to re-enter into ZuZu .. for evening drinks on the patio.  With firepits roaring on chilly nights, its a very pleasant setting for a group of friends intent on a mellow night of chatting.  No ones gonna blow it out here, but its a nice spot to grab wine, beer, or specialty cocktails (which, come to discover taste like Pine-Sol and shit).    Anyway, ZuZu is a pretty unique spot in that you can start both your morning and your evening there before romping around Old Town.

I love minimalism.  If you can class up a place with a less-is-more approach, then you've exceeded the abilities of 95% of the American population.  Fortunately for the Cen Pholks Lisa G has this aptitude that transcends through her decor and into her simplistic, but delicious organic food.  Now, here's my deal: you put prosciutto on your menu and and I'm gonna get b-boy on your hardwood floors like Ozone in Breakin' 2.  Lisa G's breakbeats the hell out of their prosciutto sandwich with caramelized onions, parm cheese, fig jam, and arugula on an Italian loaf.  A side of balls and their Alamos Ridge Malbec and I'm fresh.  Service?  Never had a bad experience, but who cares?  The food outshines any flaws of a young dine-in.

If there was a "Stuff White People Like" ( stuffwhitepeoplelike.wordpress.com/ ) Phoenix edition, Tammie Coe would knuckle "Hiking Camelback Mountain in a Sportsbra" and "Talking About Moving to the Garfield District" for the top spot on the list.  Okay, Tammie Coe fucking pwns most bakeries around the Valley, but come with it now ... some people act as if Tammie INVENTED butter and flour, mined salt from the Egyptian earth, handcrafted porcelain urns for homespun mixing, and bred a sui generis species of chicken which would bless her cakes with perfectly viscous embryos.  Its a bakery.  Its good.  Its not gonna change your life.  Whereas most cities have a plurality of home-hearted, local bakeries, PHX's core is missing exactly that, which magnifies TC's presence and quality.  Their cakes are, in fact, beautiful and noticeably take hours of work, but lest we forget the no-frills Mexican, Middle Eastern, and Scandinavian/Bavarian bakeries around town that would go toe-to-toe with TC like Rocky vs Ivan Drago.  TC trains on those perfectly calibrated weights while the Rockies of the Valley lift rocks and boulder mountains n shit.    The fantastic thing is, there is ALWAYS room for a bakery.  There are never enough.  TC is a favorite spot, particularly for the birthday events I've been to around the valley, for an after-work pick-me-up and a Sunday morning sugar rush.  Their selection is inane.  I can never decide what I want, actually, what I want is ALL of it.  This place is on a very short list of one when it comes to ordering special event baked goods and its just around the block from me, so Tammie Coe *is* my local bakery which entitles me to say, in the words of Nelson Muntz, "HA ha!"

The Yard House is the Reggie Bush of Phoenix establishments.  O-ver-rated.  Undeserving of accolades, superficially interesting, won't stand the test of time, all sizzle - no steak.  I mean, what can one expect from a corny chain, where one is overwhelmed by Disney-fied cake and ale?  This place couldn't be less lame if they renamed it Chotchkie's and served Extreme Fajitas.  Actually, I'm shocked that they don't.  Okay, okay.  I like beer.  They've got it.  But where is their sincerity?  They couldn't give a squirt of piss that they are serving rare Belgian pilsner.  I'm supposed to feel okay about this?  I need authenticity when I'm at a bar.  This is why so many Ultras in Scottsdale or LA or wherever fail with me, the dearth of convincing clientele, staff, and moreover, product.  Don't shit on my pillow and tell me its a little piece of chocolate.  Overall, this is a genuine 1-star rating ... not one of those mealy-mouthed "oh, i wanted to give it LESS but I couldn't!" reviews.  Go grab a beer here, but don't expect anything more than a bridled time with the fancypants of Fashion Square Mall.    P.S. One time I saw a guy valet his yellow Testerossa here and got out like he ran shit ... until minutes later the exact same model pulled into the valet area right behind him.  Ha!  Nice rental, watermelon balls.

Based on the number of reviews, I'm surprised how many people have been here and formed enough of an opinion on it to register their delight or disgust around the world wide tubes.  In any event, this place is IT.  It suffices for any mood that you happen to be in -- chill, raucous, moody, bouncy, happy hour, just-passing-through,  here-all-night, or last-call.  Day drinking is excellent here, as you have no awareness of the time or the brutal Arizona heat.  So is last call ... strong drinks and better-than-reasonable prices to send you on your way out to drunkenly find a nearby Dunkin Donuts.    They have an interesting selection of beer, and supposedly a great bloody mary, though the time i WANTED to order one, the bartender told me not to order it.  I appreciated his capriciousness about the subject.  It was late night on Christmas Eve's Eve, so he was right after all.    The pool table is a nice fit without being insistent, and its pretty easy to get on despite some other reviewers objections.    The only thing i would change is the jukebox, and not even necessarily CHANGE it, but add some more shit, cos i can really only hear The Smiths "Half A Person" one time a night and I'm tired of that jackass who insists on "Psycho Killer" for the millionth time.

My ethnic experience isn't rooted in the middle eastern culture, but my fiancee's is, and she goes nuts in here buying some awesome, interesting, and delicious gear like tahini, chick peas, za'atar, feta, etc for making things like hummus, za'atar bread, and the like.  I picked up a half-rack of lamb chops and a side of couscous for prepping ($12) together.  Their butcher is awesome and far different from retail grocery chains in Phoenix.  They have a mountain of hooves, FYI.    Typically, the prices are inexpensive-to-reasonable, but sometimes the rarer items are a bit elevated in price.  That is totally understandable considering the unavailability of this type of product nearly anywhere else in the valley.  They make you put at least $10 on your debit, so be aware, though they have so much good stuff that this fee is easy to surpass.

Whoa!  Lots of reviews on this place makes me realize I've been daft not coming to this place earlier despite it being closer to me than Lux or Willow House ... and ... i enjoyed it much more than either one of those other places.   The barista (not sure if it was the owner since it was my first visit) was really polite and witty and even made me a Chai Charger to my exact specifications.     The outdoor seating was simply perfect for a cool January morning and was shaded by the building because somehow the Arizona sun never takes a break from gettin' yo ass, no matter what season it is.  We could enjoy hot coffee (or chai), smoke squares, and chat in a semi-private setting.  The charm of this building is what originally attracted me to the place, but the great drinks and setting is what will keep me coming back.

For some reason, I always forget about this place.  So, i opened up the reviews page and remembered *why* i liked this place so much.  Good drinks and creative menu in a stylish atmosphere.  The food is nothing spectacular, IMO, but the uniqueness of it is always tempting to the palate.  Their salsas are good, their street tacos are good, their mojitos are good.    Basically, its a 'good' place to go wine and dine ... and the atmosphere can elevate your evening to 'great' status.    I need to try their patio, cos I've only dined/drank in their resto portion.

I feel lucky to have an AA here in the Valley.  My current favorite piece of clothing is this heather blue tee that I'm rockin from there.  Its casual, classic style that I love and no other company produces quality knits like AA does.  I wish they would expand further to more stores in the Valley (Hey!  Downtown has PLENTY of boutique space for rent all over!)  and in other cities that I consider 'home' (re: Austin).

IKEA is like a real-life Highlights Magazine.    Bring to recollection the hidden pictures, where there was a tricycle veiled in the branches of a tree or in this case the perfect end table masked by all of that ambient furniture strewn about like the open end of a freshly packed U-haul, using your parsing abilities to determine that those lime green furnishings match all of your college furniture exactly.  Then we have our Goofus and Gallant twads traipsing around the place causing the do-gooders headaches by snatching cheap wares because they saw it first, or bouncing on the couches to see if it meets the durability quotients of their friends who might, someday, crash on it.    The Timbertoes would love all of that cheap, pressed wood; no threat to their family, Spot and Splinter included  As the magazine itself crows, IKEA is "fun with a purpose".  This is a cheap, but decadent playground for adults seeking some faux-shag accessories and duvets and pizza cutters for 50c.  I can't say that I don't participate willingly.  Occasionally you find a gem that, as The Dude would adjudicate, 'really ties the room together.'  Glad its here in Phoenix.

Lola is like the girl in the 'coming-of-age' teen film who looks busted through 55 minutes of the movie, but by the 3rd act is looking hotter than two squirrels humpin' in a wool sack.  The potential underneath all of that camouflage is so plainly obvious, it makes you groan out loud to anyone who will listen, that all it takes is a bit of a careful hand to really bring out the stunning perfection.  Lola needs a chrysalis.  All of that *just* out of visibility charm and essence is there, but the nerdy glasses and stained teeth are bringing it down.    For one, the food is really good, but not excellent.  Its there.  Oh, that 5-star rating for the food is in the mail, but something is *just* missing from that taste.  The place is vibrant, but *just* a little awkward.  I really like the community tables and the lighting but sometimes it feels wrong in there.  Their sangrias are very nice, the red is perfect and the white is very near perfect, but just a little too much canela.  I haven't been in a while and I definitely need to get back there soon because each time I've been its really improved, but I really want Lola to be a place that you show off to your friends, not the MoPed that you sneak around your friends.

One of two world class stadium in the United States (The other being Reliant Stadium in Houston), which is utterly ironic, given the average undedicated and sophomoric Valley sports fan.  Its like handing the keys to a Porsche Cayman to a blind man; each never fully appreciating the monster cache of the respective masterpiece.    What UoP stadium provides is an architecturally accomplished building, both inside and out, which doubles as a venue for sports designed by world class architect, Peter Eisenman.  Not only was the field was built to host the holiest of holy American football events, but world football matches, final fours, and conventions.    I've seen American football and world football inside this stadium, and the place is unmatched in intimacy, intimation factor, sightlines, and amenities, all a true testament to its thoughtfully creative design.  Even location doesn't detract from the stadium, as its primary use is for large-scale, infrequent, weekend events, which forces local-sports-fan to be out tailgating or enjoying Westgate for several hours before and after the game, anyway.    I would state that its only flaw is the unfortunate name, pegged to its brow like a scarlet sentence.

Heaven forbid that any act I'm into is seeking a show palace out in Phoenix's paved over backyard, Mesa, Arizona  Short of a Smiths, one-show-only reunion, I will never venture here just to park my happy ass 3 miles from the venue, plant my ass in an ocean of unenthusiastic knuckleheads who insist on sitting on their ledge in lieu of standing, and praying for a geyser of alcohol to emerge from Mesa's rancid underground so that I may indulge in a beverage past 9 o'clock.  No proper show should EVEN START by 10pm, much MUCH less end by that time.  WTF?  How in the world did this venue even get approved?  This is like getting a chance to party on the tour bus with Van fucking Halen, only they decided to reunite with Gary Cherone as their frontman and they all were experimenting with homosexuality that week and drank Mr Pibb instead of Maker's Mark.  A freaking nightmare this place!

Boy-o, have I've put in some good hours here at The Half Moon, particularly because many of my friends-slash-footie-teammates are servers, bartenders, and managers and insist that we drink their booze whilst we watch them work, i suppose.   Inevitably, this ends up as a free-for-all alcohol orgy that will always involve several Mechiladas (they will make em for you if you write the recipe down on a napkin with the special, final ingredient being "lots of love" as a reminder not to forget the extra love that goes into a perfect Mechi), some chick-shots that sadly include Red Bull and something else equally garish so that it tastes like almost-flat Squirt, a death swig of Wild Turkey out of the fanciest slingback shoe in the group (If you do two consecutively, we call it a "Bingo-Bango"), several double-tall Vodka/Soda/Lemons, 250 Parliament Ultra Light cigarettes, and a single Chicken Caesar Wrap.  By this time, I am usually craning my neck to see the HM's awkwardly placed LCD screens and drunkenly rambling very loudly about how "Tim Duncan can suck my cock" (2005), or how "Nowitzki can suck my cock" (2006), or how "I wish I had multiple cocks so the whole city of San Antonio can suck my cocks and then beat David Stern with them about the neck and chest until he begged for clemency from my multiple cock beat-down" (2007).  Anyway, this location is a decent spot for some casual game-watching, but IMO, not for the nexus of critical game watching, like your alma mater playing your sister-kissin rivals from that fucktarded state to the (east/west/south/north).  My buddies and I particularly like catching the US Men's National (soccer) Team here -- once they even put it on the Mexican Channel to enhance the excitement!  Later arriving patrons seemed very cautious and confused upon entry, but felt the Sunday mechilada love as we put a "Dos-a-uno" mudholing on 'El Pinche Tri' (Mexican MNT).  The staff here is friendly enough to put it on any channel you'd like too -- I've had to specially request the Titans game on a few occasions (why the fuck doesn't anyone like to watch Tennessee, anyway?) without any kind of eye-rolling despair from the bartenders/servers.  Its also surprisingly entertaining as a pre-bars destination or even before that for Happy Hour.  The mood is more "lounge" than "sports bar"    One thing I always thought was unusual, however, was the lack of taps.  I mean, there is no draft beer at all.  And their Mexican Beer selection could use a little upgrading from the college selections (Corona, Dos XX) to the big boys (Negra Modelo, Bohemia).  Otherwise, this is a pretty cool bar in a typically stuffy part of town.

Breakfast options in the central corridor are alarmingly sparse, which creates irrational decisions like visiting 5th Avenue Cafe to percolate in your brain, brewing as a 'good idea'.  It is not.  What seems like would be a local Denny's knock off except with mahogany trim and a full bar was more like a Mel's Diner without the boorish, but hilarious short-order cook and a tad dirtier.  My fiancee's veggie breakfast was frightful and dry while my I found myself surrendering to the French toast offensive.  No amount of store-bought syrup could conquer that alpine mountain of suck.  Somehow, i don't think this is what France had in mind when they lent the moniker to breakfast heaven.  They need to rename them Freedom Toast, as in, set these things free in the front asphalt parking lot so the hospital pigeons can feast.  The ambiance is absolutely laughable at best.  In every available sight line are TV [one was one of those old-school rear projector behemoths on a ledge] set to CNN just in case you want to know the weather in Duluth as you fight your chewy bacon.  Coincidentally, there is the hospital across the street, convenient for an outpatient stomach pump should the need present itself.

So, the Vig and I are unlikely friends ... but we get along real nicely despite our glaring differences.  It has the facade of an old Motor Inn Lodge, found somewhere deep in the Midwest, complimented by a spacious sun patio and a bocce court.  Yet it has the modern opulence you would expect in Arcadia.  When the Vig combines the two, you get dap cocktails and wine in the most comfortable and inviting surroundings.   In my opinion, the Vig is the best place in the Valley to day drink, especially on a lazy Sunday when you can sit up on the bar, feast on their Posole, drink Mechiladas (which they will make upon request), and venture out into the warm sun after working up a chill in their cavernous interior.  They also have half-price wine on Sundays.  I also must mention that their staff is probably the most friendly group of people out of any bar I've been in around the valley.

I cannot fathom why somebody +21 would go here other than the cruel initiation of a Community College Rugby hazing or you are someone who thinks some chick from Mountain View will check out your onions if you buy her a couple of screwdrivers.

PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!!  IT'S PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!! PEANUT BUTTER JELLY TIME!!!   This is what I expect most of the douchenozzles and their accompanying dirty vagina'ed amigas have on an endless, thousand-decibel-loop inside their pea-brains as they lean like euro-cholos here at Loco Patron, never really acknowledging each other until the battle call "JAGERSHOTS JAGERSHOTS JAGERSHOTS" , is signaled to the witless congregation, first as a question, then as an affirming statement, and finally a rallying yell, like a slow-clap-progression in a John Hughes movie.  If this is you, take your hand and slap some sense into yourself ... you are annoying the piss out of me as I stand there drinking my shitty beer in a crappy version of Mexican Chili's.    I've been to a ton of lame bars [ha! "bar" ... its a restaurant, tools] around these parts and those parts, and boy-o, this one sweeps the major categories.

If it weren't for my once-a-year loyalty/obligatory appearance to the Phoenix Texas Exes college football game-watching party, I would have never been scooted into this, what amounts to, downtrodden dive.  I feel bad for saying it because when they hosted this event, they had no idea how far over their heads they would be with this contingent (particularly since it was the first game of the season and it was on PPV).  They were woefully understaffed, the AC broke, ran out of Shiner Bock, and couldn't get the broadcast well into the Longhorns suckage of the 2nd qtr.  UT could have lost that clunker and I blame Lager Fields.  Food was okay.  Small patio for outdoor seating.  TV arrangement was serviceable.  Staff was VERY nice and apologetic.  Two stars for the effort and one for stocking the Shiner Bock.  I won't be back though.

In n Out vs. Whataburger  Dicks out everyone.    I've had many an argument as to the godliness of each and though I tend to stand in the In n Out camp when discussing this with my Texas friends, and contrastively with my West Coast friends, i stand firmly that each has its place near the high end of the hamburger spectrum.   Visiting In n Out  for the first time is like being a drunken male in some unfamiliar La Quinta bathroom in Reseda, California.  There seem to be limited options.    But once you get the feel of it, you realize that you can sit down to pee if you want.  You can use the towel rack to brace yourself.  You can pee in the bathtub or bypass all ration and lay in the damn tub like a newborn ... all kinds of stuff you would never do at your regular place.  Treat this place like that budget hotel.  This is not your regular place, this In n Out Burger.  Be creative.  Get nasty.  Try that 3x3 Animal Style with Animal Style fries.  Grilled onions?  Throw those bitches on.  Kick down with a Neapolitan shake ... and ... use that plastic, cos In n Out takes card now.  Word.

Asia de Cuba just obliterates the portion of my brain that would provide the defense mechanism from thoroughly enjoying such an insolent, precocious establishment.  As it turns out, AdC kicks all kinds of ass.     I fully endorse giving this place 5 stars and spate waterfalls of chicharrone green beans, rivers of mojitos, and valleys of  calamari salads on the readers of this review.  And so it is written, so it shall be done.    AdC is incredibly creative and unpredictable with their menu despite themselves and the overworked 'fusion' theme.  Some examples of AdC fare: crab croquetas with red pepper remoulade and chile-ponzu dipping sauce, spicy Szechuan scallops with salsa verde and chorizo-lemon grass espuma, Cuban-spiced chicken with a tamarind glaze, plantain-crusted Spanish mackerel with curried noodles, pan-seared ahi with wasabi-mashed potatoes and chimichurri sauce, grilled mojito-glazed strip steak with a mango sauce infused with sak and foie gras.  I mean, whats NOT to like?  Sure the atmosphere is slightly prom-ish, but you'll find that you will get over it quickly.  Its surprisingly cozy in the surroundings, and, as a personal pleaser to my eye-palate, the decor, from staff to furniture to art, is drowned in white.  I've been to the AdC in San Francisco and felt more like a power-lunch spot than a 'dinner as an event' place.  The menus were nearly the same, but apparently design, decor, and atmosphere differ drastically from one to the next.  So, if you've been to one AdC, you most certainly haven't been to them all.  Scottsdale nails this interpretation flawlessly.

This place is a complete waste of time unless you enjoy beginner 'sushi' and like the ambiance of what I imagine the Sandals, Jamaica buffet to feel like.  Their sushi rolls are tiny, amateurish, and uninventive.  Edemame is unnecessarily seasoned with oils and sprinkles to rouse the uninitiated palate.  This is the poor man's version of Sting Ray in the tempered version of Scottsdale; Ahwatukee.  Their bar has a potentially interesting setup that looks outward onto Warner, but then again, the views affords a sweet look at Goodyear, Big O Tires, Jiffy Lube, and the several Chrysler Sebrings that the upper-working-class of the Tuke plant in the Tanked Fish's asphalt lot.

I have a dream for downtown Phoenix, and that is that all of the art-houses, such as Lost Leaf would endorse alcohol, wine, and spirits during the 30 other days outside of First Friday (gag!) and kitsch the fuck out of our downtown.  Really, considering all of the exquisitely designed and perfectly placed art-houses in the central area, our sleepy little downtown would be one of the coolest, most unique places in the US.    Sadly, only Lost Leaf has truly embraced this idea, and they've made good on their attempt.  Bottled beer and wine are about the only thing you can get here, but their selection is interesting and their prices moderate.  Their set-up is really bistro-esque, but it works.  Plus the fact that the LL is a part-time gallery is a cool requirement for placing a heap of engaging art on the walls.  Edit: Recently discovered that Monday's are Jazz Night and are freaking AWESOME.

In the style of  Bret Easton Ellis:  Took a walk down a flight of stairs, landed in downtown Phoenix, strolled into its center, into the Public Market. Don't let people lie to you, Public Markets are for the ugly. I usually shop at the Whole Foods, or the F&E, the most beautiful groceries.  Met a couple of Brits who take me to of all stations, organic fruits, vegetables, vegan cookies. I flirt a bit at the flaxseed stand, buy some bad homemade panflute CDs, then follow some girls with pink hair.  Wrote my mom a postcard I never sent, got a lecture from a Rasta junkie trying to sell me a stolen bike but settled for a hemp lecture instead. Smoked a cig in the dirt lot, but revelers kept giving me The Eye. Saw the Maya. Saw the MBB.  Saw the stand alone store. Ate a lot of weird Moroccan food. It was mild. The booths were okay. Lots of art i don't care for and moreover don't want polluting my Alvar Aalto living room. The dreamcatchers were intense. Wandered around, bought a lot of pastry, ate some intense cookies. I pretend to ice-skate around Central Avenue.  Almost become road kill. Trade songs with a Kiwi girl, then split for the Asian chocolatier.  The chocolate pound cake rocks like you can't imagine. Asian girls are small as pixies.  Sneak into the tent and steal some Couverture so good my dick goes hard. I move on to the salsas and hummuses which is a bust. Too many Americans making the stuff, too many lame pitas. I dipped olive oil with the Serrano Familia, which was a trip, to say the least. Cruise up the coast to the food court, but had no more money, which sucked. Some girl from Melrose tells us about their credit card policy, so I let her charge my card for tickets.  She thinks I'm a capitalist - my burro costs more tonight  than her entire weekly rent. She doesn't mind much when I pay the fee.  Ended up on the edge of the market, which is big and hot and dirty. Just like LA, but with awnings.  It was inexpensive and I'm jonesing - split for Amsterdam. Not the Dutch, but the Gays.  They know English so I didn't have to speak Dutch, which was a relief.  The next morning, I wake up talking to myself. I had a big bump on my head from flailing in my sleep. I get my stuff and barely make my job in south Phoenix. I no longer know who I am and I feel like the ghost of a total stranger.

I never really rate coffee houses based on their bean juice, rather convenience, proximity, and ambiance.  For me, Fair Trade rates highly in all three of those categories.    Convenience:  Its centralized but more accessible by foot, which is the penultimate mark of a legitimate urban coffee joint, second only to the taste of their drip coffee.  Walking to your favorite coffee house is one of the great simple pleasures of life.  While this isn't my favorite coffee shop, its a suitable filler when drives to Copper Star or Paisley aren't in the cards.  Proximity:  The downtown Roosevelt Row area, which is crawling with people who enjoy $5 cups of coffee and like to support a cause 'they hear' is pretty good.    Ambiance:  Much like other businesses along the Deck Central Area, Fair Trade struggles with Airport Lobby Pandemic.  They have, however, 'warmed' it up with corral walls, typical coffeehouse art, propaganda fliers, the token 'Monkey Che' t-shirt urbanite, and the sans-shower barista.  It feels like a nice place to stay a little longer.  The rear patio is nice and shaded, but if the bright ass reflection of concrete doesn't bother you, then I recommend the bustle of the front patio, as it provides the illusion of a brisk metropolis at the gateway to downtown PHX.

If you are going to spend almost $40 between two people to see a film and get the "perfect co-stars" #2 combo (1 Large popcorn 2 Large sodas) and a bag of peanut M&Ms, you better be sure that you are going to LOVE your movie experience.    And this place is exactly it for me.  First of all, this place is NEVER crowded ... which leads to less people talking all over MY movie, or texting, or just generally being muledicks in MY theater ... and, when i refer to "MY movie" and "MY theater", it really does feel as such because it is so roomy in the giant stadium-style theater with very few others around you.  It is not uncommon to get an entire row to yourself, even on a Friday or Saturday night, and it feels uncannily like being in your own personal living room, if your living room had a 50 foot wide screen, THX surround sound, and cup holders.    Also, because there are just not a whole lot of youth living downtown (combined with the availability of many, many other screens around the valley), there is just not that element of nuisance here (i know this makes me sound older than 29, but kids/teens are a pain in the arse at movie theaters).   My only complaint is that the service at the concession stands is agonizingly sllloooooow.  Still, their popcorn is fresh and they DO have self-serve butter and jappers.  Mmmmm!

Above all, the staff goes beyond the ordinary social sine qua non and makes the customer, both quad- and bi-ped, feel outrageously comfortable in a typically unpredictable and potentially erratic situation that is the doggy salon.    We brought our American White Shepherd here for a much needed romp in the tub and she tends to get uneasy around other dogs who display anxiety emanating from their owners or handlers.  But here at Smelly Dog, the staff and owner immediately put her at ease by acknowledging her, giving her a playful pet, and giving the lovable "who's a smelly doggy?" act.  I was impressed by the sincerity of it all, as dogs can see right through all of that, but each and every animal responded enthusiastically to the playfulness.    They have self-wash stations set up for the owners to rinse, shampoo, condition, blow-dry, brush, and spritz their dog.  It took about 15 - 20 mins for a thorough cleansing, which is as refreshing to the owners (she's a bed and couch climber) as it is to the dog herself.  They even clipped her long nails for her.  Total charge, $15 bones.  A freaking steal for a wash-and-go, without worrying about having to pick up the years of white fur that will be floating around in there long after we have gone.  So, thanks for that!

**NEWSFLASH**  Spokes has the best wings in town.  I know.  Hyperbole inducing spasms may commence from those who insist their spot is better.  Maybe you're right, so, let me try to convince you:  Twelve wings is a MEAL here.  They provide equal amount of wings and legs, which are sized bigger than what you find at your typical spots, even those that specialize in wings, like say, Famous Wings.  We tried the Spicy Garlic.  Pretty typical selection, but these wings had fresh (browned) minced garlic actually sprinkled ON TOP of them.  They were spicy, but not palette wrecking or over-the-top as a method of proving their wings are the hottest around.  You actually want to finish these, which I find pretty rare for me because usually I'm just wishing for the pain to end.  We also ordered the "chips and salsa".  When ordering these, something pretty unusual occurred.  The bar manager (who is a 5-star, all around GREAT guy himself) actually called out for his chef to "start some chips and salsa".  When was the last time you heard someone request to "start" some chips and salsa.  I was eager to discover what he meant by that.  Five minutes later, we were graced be FRESHLY MADE in-house tortilla chips with light (and delicious) seasoning in a smoky and firey house salsa.  It was perfect, and worthy of a class Mexican restaurant.    Spokes, as it turns out, is actually more of a bar than a restaurant despite its flare for the amazing presented on its menu.  They have very cool and unique selection of beer.  I had two pints of Drop Top Ale and my gf had a Moose Drool and finished with the Drop Top as well.  The manager also mentioned that he replaced his Guinness tap with Strong Arm Stout because it tasted much like the grandaddy of all stouts, was more interesting, and well, had an awesome pull tap.  I agreed.  Spokes has a full bar with an experienced bartender making them.  Today, they had a specialty drink with Madori, Captain's, Malibu, and pineapple juice for like $3.  He also mentioned several themed nights if you're into that.  Personally, I'm not, but its a superb place to day drink on a Sunday after hiking South Mountain.  This place picks up a lot of that, as well as cyclers, hence its name.  The experience was awesome and its cool to find a local Valley bar that hits all the right notes, including the previously mentioned manager/bartender.  He was probably the friendliest and most helpful I've experienced in the Valley.  He also insisted we sample different beers before we made a decision.  All class.    Just when you think it couldn't possibly be more charming, he discounts our tab 30% to commemorate his favorite holiday, and pointed to his Marley tee-shirt.  Just one cool f'n dude.  I highly recommend this place, especially if ya wanna get out of your neighborhood for a pint and wings.

I kind of feel like a dick giving this place such an "low" rating because out of the two times i've been here, one of them was an absolute blast and the other time i wish i was dead.    So, a fair rating would be more like a 2.5  The Good:  They have the coolest spot on the Washington drag, complete with rooftop patio that is completely urban and when CityScape comes to fruition will be the ultimate place to view it.    The Bad:  However, the owners have completely missed what their target rooftop market should be, and "dumbed" this place down with awful DJs and a projection screen ... not to mention an completely forced "VIP room", which seems more like a holding cell than somewhere to put the local celeb dorks that frequent this place.    The Good:  The decor and design.  The interior is very classy  The Bad:  Their current clientle has completely missed the point.  Tuck in your fucking shirt, or don't, but do it with some fucking style.  You look like shit and you're making this fine bar with some massive potential look like a dive.    The Good:  They have a DJ  The Bad:  He plays bad Hip Hop/Rap.  I don't mean that i hate Hip Hop.  The exact opposite, actually.  He just plays all the horrible shit.  Would it kill you to update your selection from "irrelevant" to "marginal"?  How about going beyond that to some indie hip hop like Spank Rock, Handsome Boy Modeling School, M.I.A., or Ohmega Watts?  How about something everyone knows dispersed in there, like Common, Jurassic 5, Lupe, Nas, or OutKast?  The music upstairs is straight up boring.    The Good:  You can have a fantastic time here with all of your friends  The Bad:  You need ALL OF THEM there to make this possible

This place is still a whisper in the downtown scene, which is both a positive and a negative.  This place is pretty small, so the more people who crowd this place, the worse off the rest of us will be who don't want to stand around a narrow bar.  Yet, places like these need to thrive and the more who frequent the place the better, obvs.  I really enjoy the deep-dark basement this place emulates.  The bartenders are friendly and quite literally VERY skilled at their craft, being able to understand your drink order over the Krakatoa-volcanic-eruption-like noise level that is the Ruby Room.    I like the cheap drinks and the accessibility to the smoking 'patio', which also doubles as the parking lot.  Nonetheless, the bouncer here is really friendly and chatty during those sometimes-lonely smoke breaks.

I'll admit a flaw when dining: that is, atmosphere goes a looong way with me.  Even if the menu is mundane, the wine is uncreative, or the waiters curt, you can still win me over with making me feel like a badass in your restaurant.  After all, most of our palates aren't refined enough to decipher the differences between feral rabbit and wolverine paws.  Not that they serve either of the two here, but you get the point.  Radio Milano, in fact, DOES NOT have a boring menu, average wine or rude waiters ... but there is nothing here to absolutely THRILL you.  What it is, is creative food that is presented magnificently, but lacks a certain flair.    When i went (date night), we had the roman artichoke with bread crumbs (great), vegetable antipasti (good), and the meatballs with some spaghetti (average).  Their portions are pretty small, so luckily my gf is a light eater and is just as thrilled with atmosphere and booze as I am.  For dessert, we had the olive oil cake, which was creative, but slightly above average in taste.  What IS awesome are the drinks.  I had a Ginger Press (They use Tito's Handmade Vodka!) and my gf had the Sauvignon Blanc.  Both delicious and unique to the Valley.    I wanted to have another, but we decided to head over to Postino to continue on a little wine tour, however, their cocktail and wine list is impressive.    All in all, i was mildly impressed with the food.  They do a good job creatively, but they need to really improve on their specialties.  Their staff is VERY cool and I would certainly go back to visit the bar.  Also, i like that they are part of the LGO people, cos, face it, they've increased the cache of Central Phoenix one million fold.

Palette has the advantage of being mere steps from my place, so its the type of review that starts with 5-stars and works its way down.  Coincidentally, it also happens to be a fantastic restaurant, so no need to demote any of those illustrious pentagrams.  First, the building is an absolute gem in DT PHX.  Anytime I get to eat in a restored historic home, it just feels cool and legit ... especially given their classic French bistro/brunch fare.  It just fits.  I've had their french toast which i really enjoyed, and I have to hand it to them, they make a MEAN, i say MEAN, Bloody Mary.  Its probably the best one I've ever had at a restaurant or bar.  Yeah, i was surprised how quickly the tab could add up, but having been here several times in the morning for coffee before work, the quality of the food and friendliness of the staff makes it worth it.  Oh, and their pastry are insanely delish too, but they tend to run out quickly.    I noticed recently when i was passing by around 7pm on a Friday night that they were open ( and BUSY!), and was wondering if they have expanded their hours from just a breakfast/brunch place.  Anyone?

This place is gayer than a box of birds.  No, really, everyone in this place is denying themselves the reality of their sexual ardor; from the c*ckhungry bouncers whose cheap Express suits are actually managing to drape their puny frames like a weakling gang of pin-striped Ciceros; to the hypersexulized female bartenders, who lend their primary attention to the fraction of the clientele NOT ordering drinks (erm, the women who are looking for men to buy their Strawberry-Guava-Valtrex Mojito).  The bar itself is sorta cool.  There is a long L-shaped bar and a decent prom-style dance floor, that puts the d*ckheads dancing on parade for your entertainment.  But, then there's that damn 90's inspired decor that f'ing Scottsdale can't seem to get over.  Freaking couches in the bar, man.  Are we supposed to feel important because we're sitting on a g'damn suede sofa drinking a mid-range scotch?  Overall, everything but the booze here sucks.  The f-faces out front actually made me and the wolfpack group of 4 dudes actually wait in an invisible line outside of the door for at least 20 minutes so that they 1) could teach us a lesson that 4 dudes should not be rolling solo to Scottsdale clubs (they were right, but we were meeting the rest of the group inside, which included females) 2) give the impression that their club was worth a shite (they were wrong) 3) compensate for years of penis torment with this new-found power while making $8 an hour plus whatever crappy tips the bartenders decide to admit to them that they made that night.  Fucking avoid this place if you know what's good for you.

In fitting fashion for the Glam frequenter, i didn't take the time to actually read any of the other reviews.  They're probably not as good as this one anyway.  So, i'm going to skip them.  Yes.  I'm going to do that.  Maybe I'll read them later, when i wake up around 3pm, which will be an hour earlier than my usual time.  Oh yeah, Glam rocks the block.  Or it used to.  I don't really know.  I've moved on.  But at one point it was my church and Faux Show DJs/Devon on the bar were my holy trinity.  But that was a long time ago, and as I've already said, it probably sucks now.    If this place was any LESS pretentious, it would be a Scottsdale Ultra-lounge, but since i forced myself into 'The Scene' one time a long time ago, it wasn't I who was looked down upon.  Fortunately.  Because God be damned i had a kickass time here.  You know, a long time ago.     But yes, their drinks are strong and prices cheap and Devon is a twink who can make a drink.  Plus they play lots of CSS, LCD Soundsystem, Datarock, Los Campesinos, and Mickey Avalon, which is nice.    Sigh.  I miss this place.  Or I don't.

I see the lot of people whining about this venue, but the truth is, places like this keep the 'soul' of Phoenix from becoming sterile, banquet halls fit for quinceneras and not shit like Of Montreal, Nada Surf, and Stereophonics.  Does anyone suppose that CBGBs (RIP) had multiple, opulent bathroom stalls with a flunkie to hand you a crisp towel with super absorbent fabric to wipe your delicate lil hands with and maybe some Michael Jordan cologne to spritz on your Threadless tee?   Come on now.  This is what matters:  They get the best mid-level indie acts to the Valley.  They have a VERY convenient bar to navigate from multiple angles.  Better than decent sightlines and you can essentially 'make' your view of the band from 2 feet away to 40 yards away  Good quality sound.  They will let you open a tab and the bartenders don't persecute you for it.  They set aside the teens and their ambient noise.  Parking is mostly convenient.  Generally inexpensive shows.  They have an accessible 7-11 for cigs and mixing Slurpee/Boone's Strawberry Hill pre-concert drinks (don't ask) for an improvised trunk party.  They have no problem with in-sies and out-sies for the smokers.  The door guys have historically been cool as shit (its a secret, shhh..)  I always look forward to a band who's Valley stop is gonna be The Clubhouse, as its more intimate than The Marquee and has a little bit of fucking character that I need for ambiance.

This would be the perfect place to see a bunch of old broads crowing about the Sex and The City movie, comparing themselves to fictional, empty, pathetic, meaningless women, and guffawing over a disappointing assortment of wines about how the sequel better show a full-frontal of Big (unless the first film had it, I wouldn't know.  *shrug*)  The only thing more of a headache than Old Town Scottsdale is Old Money Scottsdale.  Skip it unless you are an old broad or have future aspirations to become one.  The service sucks too.

[Edit/Update]:  Okay, Hazelwood's has stepped up their game.  they now have flatscreens outside for a perfect outdoor gamewatching experience -- or if inside is the way you swing, then each booth boasts its very own 15 inch LCD.  Their wing selection has grown and their beer continues to be on a rotating special.  This place is a premier game watching spot.  I really love this place as a happy hour spot especially because they have the tastiest wings in the valley and because they have a specialty beer on sale every day (maybe its a weekly sale -- don't go consistently enough to know).  Oh, and these beers are huge too.  Some nights, Thursdays i think, you will run into the Roller Derby Girls post-practice or post-fire-bombing, whatever.  Frankly they frighten me, but I find it pretty intriguing that they go there to get lit.   If the Roller Derby ain't your thing then they have plenty of large flat screens to watch a sporting event.  Their set up is pretty conducive for good game-watching.  They have some table games like shuffleboard (fun) and foosball (fun) and videogames like Big Buck Hunter (dumb -- for my dweeb friends only).  Hazlewood's also has one of the best smoking patios in the Central area -- its huge and you can usually find a good seat.  Typically, we park it out here for the majority of the night.  Trivia night used to be pretty cool as well, but got to be sooo cool that everyone we knew would join us on Thursday nights and fuck up our sweet answers.  Stupid friends.  The four star ranking is a result of: ~ Great wings ~ Good beer specials ~ Good smoking patio ~ Interesting clientle  ~ Good game watching

Disclaimer:  The following review was made prior to the recent changes (including the menu) at C4.  The review has been updated following the old one ...  The two times that I've been here was to both eat and drink.  The Food: Completely average, but the prices were a pleasant surprise for the Central Corridor.  To start, my gf and I had edemame, which tastes like every other restaurant edemame, only cheaper, which made it taste immediately better than any other.  We then had sushi, which was pretty forgettable, which is another way of saying that i literally don't remember what it was.  For the entree, I had the Mahi sandwhich which was decent, but tasted almost swampy, which was weird.  My gf had the fried tofu, which she did not finish due to her dissatisfaction with it.  Oh well, I considered it inexpensive "bar food" anyway, because the main reason we were there was to drink.  The Drinks:  Are good and the atmosphere is pretty cool.  I actually preferred the set-up of Camus much more however, because the low tables in the bar dining room are waay too short and feel misplaced in there.  They need to invest in some high-tops, and i really miss the cushion back couches lining the wall of Camus.  Oh well ... because then we headed up to the rooftop bar.    Okay, so on our first two visits, its incomplete.  There is no bar up there or even any service, but according to the staff, its in the works.  When this becomes available, this will be a very cool, very chill spot.  It has the striking urban views of our city's best scraper-lined street, Central Ave and really comfortable couches.  You can take your drinks up there, and they want you to put them in plastic, but just casually sneak your wine glass up there with you and no one will give you heat.      The three star ranking is a result of:  ~  Below average, but inexpensive food ~  Average drink prices ~  Good location ~  Good views ~  Cool rooftop patio   NEW REVIEW:  So, we returned to C4 to check out the new menu and it has been upgraded tremendously.  The food is much better, I had the chili beer short ribs which was smothered in a tasty sauce and fell right off the bone.  Good choice!  My gf's chopped salad was serviceable, but rather dinky.  When Ben, the owner, stopped by to inquire about our thoughts on the food, he said that he agreed with the opinion on the salad and that he would upgrade it immediately.  THAT'S service!  The prices have gone up slightly, but you get what you pay for.  Quality food worth returning for.  We had a delicious frozen lime tart to complete the meal (made in-house!) and we were very sated.  We returned to the rooftop to catch the end of "Sunsets", and lemme tell you, this will be a Valley hot spot in no time.  Word just has to get out.  Its been greatly expanded to cover most of the roof and the views are like no other drinking establishment in town.  People just love to drink up high.  The seating has also been reconfigured to maximize space and the sightline.    I'll definitely be returning to this place for both the food and atmosphere up top.

Sun Devil Stadium exemplifies the scabrous spirit of major college football.  Hugged by treacherous buttes and capped by an unfriendly sun, the stadium promotes one of the most overstated home-field advantages nation wide.    Unfortunately, this is pretty much where it ends.  The advantage, I mean.  While the gold-fit student section can get raucous and humorously nasty to visitors (I know -- I used to drink 40ozs in there -- hey it was college *shrug*), the donators, alumni, tee-shirt fans, and casual observers make for an embarrassingly flat atmosphere.  Sure, during the big games, there's all that standing and cheering, and drinking and  ... but EVERY game in the PAC is important when we're discussing Rose Bowl implications.  Still, this review should be more about the stadium itself, and the glory that she adds to the history of the game.  I'm delighted to say that she's aged perfectly, and truly has the best sightlines of any college stadium I've been.  It was a sad day when the cozy confines of SDS lost the Fiesta Bowl to the money-crapping machine over in Glendale.  College football needs to persist in environments like these, where amenities beyond a flask and an aluminum seat are unnecessary.  The concourses are still breezy and wide and getting around the stadium is very easy.  I'd like to see the concession lines shorten a bit by actually employing slightly competent service workers.  But that is a minor flaw.  I'm only here for 3 hours, 6 days a year at maximum, anyway.  I hope SDS never comes down.  It won't.  College football is a different animal, supported by a different kind of sports fan.  Even the demented minds behind Valley planning can't muck this place up.

Yeah, i'm just going to echo everyone's general sentiments, and that is that nextDOOR, despite its hokey name, is the new "it-bar" in downtown PHX and possibly the entire valley.    Their set-up is phenomenal and it has the feeling of drinking on someone's patio that has much more style than you.  I love when genres are crossed, and nextDOOR's can be described as classic/mod.  Classic in the sense that the structure is in a restored historical home and traditional cocktails, but mod in the sense that there is a DJ in the attic, rebar artwork, and infused vodkas.  Pretty freaking cool.    Then, there are the city views.  Despite our embarrassing (for the nation's 5th largest village) cityscape, it does really shine from the patio of nextDOOR.    Speaking of that patio, its beautifully shaped, and VERY spacious.  The bar itself is interesting, and the service is really good.  The bartenders here are really current and stylish, yet pleasantly avoid the pretentiousness that this bar could potentially convey.  The only negatives about this bar is that they don't open until 7 pm, as I went for a happy hour drink one Thursday with my shorty only to find it closed, and the exorbitant pricing for generic vodka with lychee wedges infused.  While its a superb drink, it really shouldn't be $10 a glass.     Neither of those two things has kept me away, nor the cold as they make the patio warm with open-pit fires and heat lamps.  Good street scaping and semi-frequent foot traffic really give this place an over-the-top cosy and relevant vibe.    In a few years this place will be a staple once the Roosevelt Entertainment Dist expands further.

i hear it will be open by friday, Dec. 21.  Edit:  Well, i finally had a chance to check out The Rose & Crown on two separate nights, one being opening night, and the other a Thursday night in early January.  Because i live downtown and pretty much crave ANYTHING new, this review will be completely bias, although I'm fairly certain that other central area denizens will agree with the tone of the review.   As you walk in, there is a greeter, which is pretty awkward at a bar, especially since the front room is commanded by the bar only a few feet from the entrance.  Its a unique but awkward set up, though convenient if you are sitting on their amazingly sweet patio or on their cleverly placed benches overlooking Pizzeria Bianco and Heritage Square in general.    When i was there with my gf on a Thursday, it was pretty dreary and about 10 other people were in there whispering.  I was slightly disappointed in the atmoshere, but since the bar offered a bunch of new things to look at and talk about, i was entertained.  Business really needs to pick up in order to help the vibe of this place.  Their dart board nook is really cool, though it could be dangerous (ha!) as the only thoroughfare to the loo.    I had their fish in chips, which were nice and the proportion big, but i STILL prefer Rula Bula's (still looking for something comparable ANYWHERE else).  Still, the fish and chips were far superior to George and Dragon's.  My gf had the chicken ceasar salad, which is about at boring eating it as it is typing it.  Still, it was serviceable fare.  I enjoyed a Tetley's (which i'm impressed they had on tap) and my gf got a classic Guinness - 'cos she's cool like that.  All in all, a nice environment to drink strong ales in.  The music was obviously satellite radio, but it fit the environment, and i heard New Order, Morrissey, and your requisite Amy Winehouse.  All SOLID Brit-pub tunes.  I'd like to see a DJ night to breath some life into a stale night, or (gasp!) live music on their sizableoutside property.   When i go back, i will mos def decide to sit on the patio or on the benches in front.  That is a pretty unique feature of the R&C and as a downtownie, i'm pleased its in the neighborhood.

I'd been anticipating Tesco's new concept entering the Phoenix area for quite a while and after visiting for the first time, I'm unabashedly hooked.  I will not likely shop at any other place for groceries -- as the produce is gorgeous, their meat is proportioned into perfect dinner servings, their selection of national, name-brand products are concise but available, and their wine is CHEAP.    Those are all the makings of a perfect grocery experience, especially since i'm spending about 1/3 to  1/2 of what i would spend on a typical grocery trip to Safeway or Trader Joes.  Did i mention that their wine is CHEAP?!  The Recoleta Malbec is FOUR FREAKING DOLLARS!  I buy 5 at a time to last the whole week ;-)  I also recommend their artichokes, which are jumbo sized and quite unavailable in the same proportions at Safeway or TJs.  And, as i mentioned before their presentation on all of the fresh produce makes you want to stock up on EVERYTHING, and at farmer's market prices.  It really is amazing, this store.    Good selection of seafood and other meats.  I particularly enjoy their pork chops, and i bought 1.5 lbs of top sirloin the other day to cut up into kabobs for about $8.    All your basic needs are present here, and they have a nice selection of everything you need, from name-brand to Tesco's own Fresh & Easy brand as a generic (but still quality).    As I mentioned already, I won't do my grocery shopping anywhere else, other than to pick up a few random items (beer, breakfast cereal, water -- because F&E's selection is poor) at Safeway.

You know those tacky "Point of Pride" signs that you see spread out around the Valley, the ones with the hokey Arizona flag emblazoned on an oversized oval marker denoting a place that we, as locals, should take an extra moment to admire, lest we have a reference for culture when (if) that point itself ever arises when in the company of our non-local friends, be they friends, family, vacationers, snow-birds, banditos, and the occasional Sheriff Joe pop-quizzes, where failure would bring you 8-to-10?  Yeah those.  City officials need to walk out into the Oval Tree forest and chop down the biggest one for the 16th Hole at the TPC, home of the FBR open and drunkest, rowdiest, and most exceedingly absurd Point of Pride in the Valley.    There is no other place or event that exists like this one does on the face of the planet.  Isn't that what we Phoenicians are always searching for?  Something completely Phoenix-centric?  We lay claim to the only event of this kind, and as ridiculous as it is, unequivocally OURS.  So, the 16th hole can be reviewed as an event ... however ... those who go to the FBR are drawn to this 162 yards of fun ... and since it has a definitive boundary, it should be reviewed as a bar/lounge/dive.  Okay, so the best part are the people.  Fifteen thousand of them, sitting perched on either $5K suites [for the highbrow drunks] or on the hill above the green [for the lowbrow drunks, aka, you and I]  These are people who bring dates to a golf event.  They wear Plus-fours, and Tam O'Shanters, and knickerbockers ... layered pastel polos, firecracker shorts, and stilletos.  Heck, even the people who put on the event brazenly wear head-to-toe midnight blue velour track suits.  Its fabulously odious!  These are the people who are tailgating for a 'gentleman's game', and to take it a step further, post-game celebrate in a tent hosted by all of the valley's big nightclubs.  Right there in the golfclub's parkinglot.  This is almost like the scene in Dazed and Confused where Mike opines to Tony in the school parking lot:  "Not only are they allowing this, they are selling concessions!"  Whatever man, everyone here is just L-I-V-I-N.  So, you park your crew on the side of the hill, because remember, we're saving our change for beer money and not corporate suites, and the big deal is, IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO HECKLE!  Craziness.    Now, don't get me wrong.  Most of it is your typical, uncreative monkey-flinging shit-talk from Chad and Brent (who's friend call "Cheddar" and "Muledick", respectively), but every now and then, it gets good, particularly when someone says something creative without cussing.  After all, its just kinda cheesedick to curse at a 1,000 decibel  banshee yell in front of families and shit.  The cheers are really cool too, when someone deserves it, and the boos still make me chuckle when a golfer takes too many practice swings.  Hell, Justin Leonard flipped off the gallery one year to much applause.  Hook 'em, Justin!  Then, there's Cheddar's date Bryce, puking into her Salvatore Ferragamo bag and a little on her girl's Marc Jacob spool heels.  They are the role players to their Superstar boyfriends, perfect game time teammates like Nash and Amare.  Last year, I saw one particular glory girl clothesline herself on a fairway boundary rope.  Just absolutely priceless moment.  I cheers'ed my $7 Mich Ultra Amber to her in a salute to performance comedy.  So, anyway, this piece of the Valley is quite the unique gem.  Its ours.  No one has one just like it.  Not even close.  And you know what?  We treat it like we fucking own it.  For once Valley residents don't have to explain the cool-factor or the uniqueness of something here to those uninformed.  It speaks for itself.  And boy, does it.

Canvas was originally Phoenix's first strip mall, and my, what a legacy it has left upon the Valley.    Luckily, it has now turned into a First Friday destination as an art space and a small concert venue.  Well, according to the Arizona Republic in an article dated 1/31/08:  ----------------------------- "While the northeast corner of Third and Roosevelt Streets has previously been an open area where local artists and musicians have performed for First Friday, last December was the first time in recent years organized entertainment has taken place at the venue. Construction on the land, which covers 90,000 square feet, began in October. Within six months, CANVAS will become a nightclub, a 24-hour newsstand, a grocery, an art gallery and home to three restaurants and a miniature skate park." -----------------------------  Seriously?  This is one of the most visible spots in downtown and just about the most prime spot for a min-entertainment district.  THIS kind of grass-roots activity is why Roosevelt Row will absolutely demolish the completely manufactured 'Jackson Street Entertainment District' proposed for later this decade.  So, by June-ish, there will be:  ~ A bar/nightclub ~ 3 restaurants (I hear that one of them will be a sushi place) ~ A 24 hour newsstand (unheard of for DT, that something will be open 24 hrs) ~ A grocery (another much-needed commodity) ~ A mini skatepark (bringing the 'urban' element to RR)  They already hold concerts here, and withing the next few months they will hold one with 15 bands.    I can't wait to review this place once its fully developed.  In the meantime, I'm giving it 5 stars for the proposal.

Breadfruit is the truth.    This is corroborated by the fact that Exhibit A, i.e, the Jerk Chicken will make you a believer in a deity, be it God, Buddha, Allah, Brahman, Akal Purakh, Zeus, or Marley.  The bird is marinated in hot and spicy seasonings and finished to perfection on the grill.  It remained tender and juicy throughout, except for the masterfully charred ends that added a slight smokiness to the entire dish.    But lets back up a second.  The space itself is brilliant in its simplicity.  The walls are lime and slate gray with classy darkwood furniture.  The glassed walls look out onto the stoic skyline of downtown Phoenix and onto the hidden pave of Pierce, an homage to side-street gems that one would find in cities like NY, SF, and Seattle.   It is comfortable and cozy inside, with exposure to the cuisine sharks tending the kitchen.  At all times, there is activity, but just enough so that you feel the life of the kitchen spill out onto the dining area.  I love restaurants that pull this off.  For an app, we started with an order of the Curry Chicken Patty.  It was sensational.  Within the pastry was a harmonious balance of chicken to curry with a noticeable, but slight burn throughout.  Two came in an order, which must be shared with a partner because two pre-meal would fill you up too heavily.  When the grilled jerk chicken was presented, it was glorious because you find the Caribbean influences presented on the dish; a white wine vinegar drizzled slaw, roasted pineapple, and a succulent, savory corncob.  Where the chicken is the heart of the meal, the corn was the soul.  Paired together, I couldn't have been more delighted.  To drink, we had the D&G Spicy Ginger Beer imported from Jamaica.  Erm, I typically like Ginger Beer, but this one was branded as spicy and they f'ing mean it.  Be careful that you are prepared for spice-on-spice if you order it.  Looking back, i probably should have stuck with water, although the Ginger Beer was rudimentary for palate preservation as you meander through all of the various flavors of this cuisine.  Honestly, I cannot wait to go here to grab a Guinness (a Jamaican staple according to Zane Lamprey) or a Red Stripe.  The surging spiciness demands a brew that could handle this oral development.  Overall, I'm very pleased Breadfruit braved the Great Menace that is downtown development.  Here's to them gaining credibility as they continue to master their art (its not perfect yet, but please believe, its in the mail) and invigorate a local following of foodies and tourists alike to sample some mean Caribbean food.

Digestif is the masterwork of Valley restaurateur Peter Kasperski (Cowboy Ciao, Kaz Bar), which he describes as farm-to-table rustic Napa-Italian with up-to-the-minute ingredients in a gorgeous brick basement setting.  The mood is casual, loud-ish, and jovial.  There is a wide age-range represented and there appeared to be celebrations from girls-night-out to date-night to family dinner.  The overhead speakers set the mood (particularly for me) with indie music and the servers rock tees from their favorite bands.  The service here is impeccable, as the waiters seem to share responsibilities of each table, led by a main server who takes your order and makes sure everything's tip-top.  Pretty cool concept, i think.  My gf and I started with a bottle of the Chariot Sangiovese ($27), which was probably the second best bottle of wine I've ever had in a restaurant (behind the 2005 Escorihuela Gascon Malbec shared with Jason C and Graham C in a Buenos Aires steakhouse, but I digress).  This was a magical compliment to our starter of the meatball/parma/stewed onion Bruschettone ($9), which had such a surprisingly fantastic flavor, I actually smirked to myself in shock.  Next came the mixed greens salad ($6), which was an average salad with a red-wine vinaigrette along with a bacon & pinto soup in beef stock with a garlic baguette soaking inside.  Blown.  The Fuck.  Away.  Its fairly hearty for a starter, but I couldn't stop scooping it up until the last slurp nonetheless.  For our entrees, my GF order the seared sea scollops ($22), which came with 3 giant scallops with roasted and pureed cauliflower, pine nuts, raisins, and some other fancy things I didn't determine.  She indicated that she LOVED her dish, and this coming from a master-scallop-binger.  I tasted it ... twice it was so good ... and she was right.  The scallops were perfectly seared and very fresh.  I had the penne pasta (made fresh daily) with lamb meatballs ($17).  Amazing dish, especially for a lamb partisan, like myself.  The portions were 'just right', so that we could sample quite a few things off their menu and not feel obscenely full.  Good thing, because that Olive Oil Cake was staring me right in the face, daring me.  And yet again, ANOTHER amazing treat from pastry chef Tracy Dempsey (of Cowboy Ciao).  This was presented like a pound cake with a denser quality, warm berry black pepper sauce, roseberry sorbetto, and rose sabayon.  Now THAT put us over the top.  We were absolutely satiated at this point, so much so, we didn't even get a chance to try a digestif -- and they have quite an impressive selection, (even Gammel Dansk, which I hadn't seen in 12 years since I lived in Denmark -- I didn't even know they imported it in the US!)  So, you would expect this dinner to come out to some outrageous sum, residing in its moddish space in the epicenter of high-crust Scottsdale society in the most posh development on a Saturday night at dinnertime, right?  Nope.  Total, including a bottle of wine, an appetizer, soup, salad, two entrees, and dessert was JUST slightly above a hundo.  I will be HIGHLY recommending this place to friends and visitors, particularly because the night doesn't have to end once you leave this fantastic restaurant, as it is in the heart of the valley's most walkable entertainment district.

This place is such an easy target, its like piling on the fat, pimply kid in high school.  Here's what you need to know  1.  Girls in uniform with things out that you can sadly and quite accidentally observe 2.  They have hamburgers, hot dogs, and beer 3.  Beer is PBR or the Champagne of Beers.  No other choices. 4.  Diner style seating, long high tops, patios with umbrellas 5.  Three high quality HD LCD screens in a decent, elevated spot. 6.  There will be some shiesty characters present.  7.  Don't go here with your girlfriend.  Their screens and ironic selection of beers earns 'em two stars.

This place DESTROYS any other quick-dine at every airport I've been to around the planet in terms of quality of food and making it not feel like you're waiting for the 3:35 to Tulsa for some lame family thing.  But take this review with two scoops of salt -- this IS an airport bar after all and drink tabs here add up quicker than Rainman.    First, let me inform you that this spot is in the gate 1-13 (I can't remember how high the gates go before you move over to the neighboring set of gates) in Terminal 4.  Usually the destinations I travel to using Southwest fly out of this area, which is great because I NEED a bloody mary and Terry Bradshaw cheese fries before a flight.  Kind of my tradition I guess, but both are freaking GREAT before a flight.  You can get a double for $1 more to get that extra kick of vodka.  There are a ton of TVs and a whole lot of tables despite its tiny square footage.  Every time I've been in here it was crazy packed, but have had no problem finding a table either immediately, or with in a few minutes.  Turnover and service here is quick.  I will also add that this place, despite its name, is NOTHING like the similar monickered spot in North Scottsdale.  In fact, I wish that the place up north was more casual like this one.

As told by Damon Gogh:  There's nothing I could say to make you try to feel okay, And nothing you could do to stop me feeling the way I do. And if the chance should happen that I never see you again, Just remember that I'll always love you.  I'd be a better person on the other side I'm sure. You'd find a way to help yourself, And find another door. To shrug off minor incidents, And make us both feel proud. I'd just wish I could be there to see you through.  You always were the one to make us stand out in a crowd, Though every once upon a while your head was in a cloud. There's nothing you could never do to ever let me down, And remember that I'll always love you.

Al-Hana is the cafe located inside the Baiz Market that serves amazingly genuine middle eastern provisions ... this according to my fiancee who hails from Michigan, worked in a Middle Eastern restaurant while going to MSU, and considers it her favorite cuisine.  Wrap that into one giant grape leaf, and you have one crazed Middle Eastern food enthusiast.    We went here to pick up a few groceries and some take-out from the small cafe tucked in the front corner of the market.  I had already called 'dibs' on the chicken shawarma while on the short car-ride to East-Central Phoenix, and I fist-pumped in her face to let her know I just shook her down.  Um, no worries for her because she dominated the rest of that menu, ordering a falafel sandwich [in pita], za'atar bread [dipped in labne purchased at the back deli], and six veggie grape leaf rolls.  Lunch + leftovers = $20.  All of it was fresh, delicious, and enormously stirring.  Their blends of spices and dips are phenomenal.  I considerably recommend Al-Hana as a quick stop for genuine M.E. grub.

All-In-Entertainment is a company who hosts free entry No Limit Texas Hold 'Em poker tournaments Valley-wide at area bars every night of the week.  Depending on the day-of-the-week, you may have up to 12 options where to play in a tournament around the Phoenix metro and they typically have at least one selected bar in every reach of the Valley -- even the sticks like Goodyear, Surprise, and Peoria.  Back when this company started during the NL craze [maybe in 2005 or so], there were masses of people nightly at each spot.  Now, attendance has died down a bit, but there are still plenty of participants and a semi-regular tournament of the board leaders to showdown against each other for prizes like, oh, entry into the WSOP satellite events.  Yeah, kind of a big deal.  The dudes who run this impress me as they have really built up their business despite the fleeting phenomena of NL Texas Hold Em, but it appears they are still going strong ... and that small venture that started in Phoenix has expanded to 7 other cities in 4 other states, including Oregon and California.  Pretty impressive.    If you want some practice for Vegas, you should use the opportunity of going against real-live competition for minimal risk [actually, no risk, as it is completely free except for the beers and possibly food you buy at whatever local pub you happen to be playing at -- and you should bc its how they keep their business thriving].  IMO, it is much more valuable of a Vegas prep than going against some aggressive online dweeb in Elk City, Oklahoma.

I have a notion that over time the reviews for this place will get significantly more positive.  It just needs some time time to infuse into its new surrounding ... because this is all I'm really gathering why people have the most beef with the Willow House.  The building is interesting and quaint, which is suitable for an indie coffee house and a pretty killer lawn out in front.    The coffee itself is above average.  I'm not particularly blown away or anything ... but then, no coffee REALLY blows me away anyhow.  I'll drink motor oil if the place has a cool vibe and is local and is some sort of vehicle for the local arts.  Willow caters to all three of these requirements.   Plus, they DO have a delicious drink -- their Chai Charger -- basically a Chai latte with a shot of espresso ... hot or cold seems perfect for sitting on their patio and smoking Parliaments.  I wish they would bring back their afternoon happy hour.  Those large Chais were $3.

Hey, hey Chandler, what the F?  Why didn't someone inform the rest of us that you had a cool little thing going on?    As per usual in cases like these, we were bat-signaled to the nethers of the East-Valley to meet up with my gf's family for a night out on the town.  I was expecting Applebee's-east, set in a beautifully stucco'd historical building circa last century Lowe's vintage 1999.  Glad I was wrong.  Oh.  So.  Wrong.  Instead, we ambled over to 98 South (set in a historical 1912 bldg) after learning of  El Zocalo's hour-and-a-half wait.  No worries.  This joint had pretty much everything we needed (except one, more on that later).  So the six of us sat down immediately and were presented with a pretty nice wine list.  Nothing extraordinary (kind of surprising), but they did have a Spanish Crianza, which I found pretty nice.  This was a default choice, however, after they (gasp!) ran out of Oak Creek Pale Ale.  This should be an immediate soap-in-the-sock-flogging-penalty for any 98 South waiter of choice for cock-teasing patrons after said keg has floated.  Again, no worries, the Crianza was good enough to have ordered a second glass, and who am I to deny myself quaffable libations?  I ordered the Pinwheel, which despite its goofy name, is a serious meal!  Its 4 rounds of skirt steak (seasoning made classified for patrons, obvs) on a pillow of garlic mashed and sauteed spinach.  Fucking num num!    The others around the table appeared to enjoy their meals as well, evidenced my several "Mmm"s and a couple "you've gotta try this"es -- and you know how hard it can be to please the home-cooking-for-life-crew in which older-generation family members have lifetime memberships.  My gf had the salmon and after my requisite 'boyfriend' sample, i was highly impressed.  The ambiance was pretty cool -- lounge-y and comfortable.  They had a lounge singer doing some raucous covers of Van Morrison and even Coldplay.  Slightly weird, especially the dudes attempt at a Chris Martin falsetto, but I appreciated the effort and all-in-all he didn't take himself too seriously.  This made it actually pretty fun to listen to.    Overall, pretty freakin cool experience, especially with deflated expectations of our long-lost-cousin, Chandler.  But boy can he throw one hell of a dinner party!

Dining at Arcadia Farms reminds me fondly of the "L'Idiot" bistro in the movie L.A. Story, where Steve Martin and the cast enjoy an absurd brunch in a satire-like restaurant and order daft items like "a half double decaffeinated half-caf, with a twist of lemon" and "decaffeinated coffee ice cream".      Its exactly like this at AC.  Slightly cartoon-y, almost a parody of itself, but kind of charming in a way that makes you realize that you sit firmly on the outside of this demographic.  I find this kind of setting immensely charming, as did Steve Martin, and wryly grinned his way through haute fare and caricatures.    My gf and I smartly decided to pinch our way into Easter Brunch here after failing at Cafe ZuZu (fortunately) and Trader Vic's (thankfully), and ended up having, what can be described as the most exemplary Easter Brunch imaginable; wrought iron bistro table-tops for two, shady oaks, white linen table cloths, brick pathways, french doors, and aproned servers.  Brunch started off with breadrolls and a bottle of Fume Blanc, which was very crisp, but not tart.  A perfect brunch choice.  My gf ordered the raspberry stuffed french toast (which, as selections go, was my first choice, but was nice enough to concede the dish to her) and I chose the Breakfast Bruschetta.  We sipped our wines and waters on a very calm and cool back patio, thankful that we found a perfect spot for such an occasion on the fly.  About 20 minutes later, our meals were delivered and i was immediately satisfied with the presentation.  The bruschetta consisted of egg, sausage, and mozza on french baguette slices.  It was delicious.  The french toast was seasoned perfectly, and the raspberry and strawberries on top were a nice compliment, although, the menu claimed infusion of raspberries, and I could not detect anything resembling that.  The desserts were tempting, but we were satisfied with the wine as a digestif, though we ended up gorging ourselves shortly afterward with mechiladas and Belgian beers at the Vig, anyway, so dessert should have been in order.    Just something to make up for on our next visit.
