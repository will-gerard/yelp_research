Ok, this was my first time there. A little pricey, but it is all served family style. It is not the best Italian food I have ever had, but it was pretty good and definitely filled me up, with some leftovers for sure. The service was great and will definitely be going back. Go with an appetite and if you are not on a budget.

Well it has been a little while since I have been here for lunch or dinner. I did come here for a networking meeting about 6 months ago and that was pretty good, but I didn't pay anything for it, but would have. My girlfriend and I ran in here the other day and wish I would have went to Golden Corral, but didn't have the time. There is really no selection and it hasn't really changed in 10 years or so. The manager was sitting at the table as you walked in and talking to a few people, one who used some foul language. The waitress was actually great though, I did tip her well for her service. The quality of the food was ok, but just not the selection or quality of Golden Corral and they charged us $23 for both of us for dinner with 1 soda and a water with 2 dinners. I just don't think you can compete with Golden Corral, so don't charge their prices. Keep up the good breakfast though.

Wow, these guys were great!!!! I had a few minutes to kill waiting for a restaurant to open and remembered driving by many times. Pulled up to the automatic cleaner and the guy started spraying the front of my car, so I rolled up my windows and they continued all the way around, rinsing and scrubbing. When they were done, I paid the guy $7 for a average a little above basic wash and went into the machine. When I got out, 2 guys were there and dried the rest of the car and used an air pressure thing to get the water out of the little crevasses they get into and leave water marks. They did an excellent job and will continue to go there when in the area.

I have to say I am not a big Valentine's fan. I don't like Hallmark holiday's. We ended up by chance going to MiMi's for Valentine's Day and they had a great menu and price for that menu for the evening. I am just impressed by their service, portion size and just the overall experience. I just love this place.

Steve and his crew over at the PostNet office are great. They have done business cards, brochures and have done and exceptional job. Steve does whatever he has to do to make sure his clients are happy, he is very detail orientated and I recommend him to everyone.  Everything has been done in a timely manner and they have went above and beyond, as both times I have used them, they were things that needed to be done yesterday and he got them done faster than he originally promised and they looked amazing. Thanks Steve and PostNet. Give him a shot for all your printing needs and stop in cause he offers so much more that I thought.

This is one of the best places and by walking in the door you can tell there is no secret about this place. It is awesome and again I sit at the bar a lot because then I don't have to wait in line. This is real therapeutic because I am realizing that I am just a spoiled brat and just don't like waiting in line, I want to just be seated. Anyway, the food is great, prices are just as great and the food portions are awesome too. I am 6'3" 260 pds. with an athletic build, so I can afford big portions cause I burn most of it off. I will get off of my soapbox and finish. Great job at MiMi's all of them are great.

I have to admit, I am not a big fan of waiting in lines. I have to say that this was some of the best mexican food I have ever had. It was worth the wait. Their service was great. I have lived in AZ for 20 + years and have never heard of this place, wow. I will definately be going back.

I am definitely impressed!!! I mean this is Mesa, conservative, boring Mesa. Don't get me wrong it is not Scottsdale, Tempe, Phoenix or maybe even Chandler, but Mesa is starting to get it. I am amazed by the Arts Center it is bigger than the little house they used to house all of these activities in. There outdoor concerts on Friday I have been to a few times and am impressed by the difference in people, just a good variety and every seems to be having a good time. Keep growing Mesa, a couple more little hot spot down and around the area wouldn't hurt.

WOW!!! What a surprise this place was. A friend of ours invited us to go to some wine tasting over on Country Club and University and I couldn't think of a great place that you might go to do a wine tasting. When they told me Sun Devil Liquor, I was taken back, thinking what a dive it might be.....Well What a surprise when we went in and then down in the basement. Everything about this place is just cool. John on the keyboard/piano on Thursday is unbelievably awesome and has a great following as well. If I am looking for a fun place in Mesa(I know I just said fun place in Mesa)this has to be at the top of the list. Very inviting place inside and helpful staff. Would recommend this place to anyone looking to buy liquor, beer, wine or go to beer or wine tastings that they have.

Wow, I always have driven by and they have always been packed. My girlfriend and I spent 30 minutes or so just browsing their deli and sweat treat area. Then ended up going to have a late breakfast. It was awesome I am a big breakfast fan and I will definately being going back. I want to try their deli and desserts, but the people working there were absolutely outstanding. Great Customer Service.

I have to say, the first couple times I went there. It was about a 45 minute wait and I do not like waiting in line to eat. So that always throws me off of a lot of places, but I have to say after the 3rd time we finally got in within minutes. The food was pretty good and the prices were reasonable. Eventhough I don't like lines it was well worth it to finally get in there. Remember it is out in East Mesa and a lot of snowbirds go there and they are on there way if not already here.

I have to admit. I have never heard of this place. A friend of mine, his dad was playing there. They were busy in the Restaurant, but had a few tables on the back patio empty. So we went back to the patio where we had people waiting for us and there were actually 2 additional people there as well who were not eating, but when the server walked by I tried to order and he told me I would have to wait 30 minutes because that is the waiting time.  Well by the time I told my friend's dad who was singing there, we finally got served our food. It was pretty good and a decent price. The Owner seemed to be a real nice guy, but his employees were terrible, awful. I always give a place a second chance otherwise I would have only given them one star.

I am being very generous here, because the expectations were so much higher. They jam packed us among a heard in the middle of the room. They couldn't  remember whose drink was whose and they brought my girlfriends meal out wrong, oh yeah, and it was her birthday. Well I just dropped the rating again, just remembering the experience we had. Then as they went back to fix her meal again, they just let mine sit out in front of me and get cold, cause you know if I started eating before her, not a good idea. When they finally brought her meal, we told them that mine wasn't hot anymore so they went back and nuked it, nuked it, I am paying $150+ for the 2 of us. Oh hell no!!! So we choked down our meals which were all right, I have had better. No apologies, no manager apologies, nothing. Might not ever go back!!!!!

Well, I own and operate a carpet cleaning company in the valley and was in a car accident and had a whiplash effect  with some minor annoyance and just wanted to make sure that I was able to get back to normal and not have any effects down the road and they were nothing short of professional and helpful. They took the time to answer any questions I have had, explain things to me in detail and watched out for my well being. They are a well oiled machine there, so many options to help you get back on your feet and back to normal. Dr. Genet and her crew over there is outstanding. Dr. Tom did most of my adjustments and he is great as well. Thanks guys. I will be back for normal adjustments and will refer anyone to you that I hear needs your services.

My girfriend and I love this place. Anytime we are in Tempe, we go to Gordon Biersch, anytime we have someone in town, we bring them here and never have a problem. The food is great, the beer is Great, the staff is great!!! Did I mention that the beer is Great, they are a brewery, so you can watch them make beer and wish that you could go swimming in that big pool of beer, mmmm, beer. Love it!!!

Jake is my auto guy and is over at Shuman's Auto Clinic. For years I have trusted Jake with my personal vehicle's and Business van. He is working for Mike over at Shuman's and I didn't think I can trust a car guy like I trusted Jake and then Jake introduced me to Mike and his crew over at Shuman's and they are great. They fix what needs to be fixed and they look over what other things look like they need attention and let you know the REAL Story, not a strong arm sales pitch, just real honest advice and GREAT work. Thanks Jake and Mike!!!!!

I went to my first broadway play at gammage to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. I have to say the place was pretty clean, there didn't look to be  a bad seat in the house, the staff was real helpful as it was my first time there. The bathrooms on the main floor are very difficult to get in and out of as everyone shares 2 bathrooms on the main floor, but if you go upstairs it is more accommodating. I would definitely go back for another show here.

I have referred Roofing Consultants of Arizona on many occasions over the past 10 plus years. They are quick to come out when it isn't raining, but that is to be expected. Very helpful though in those moments as I had a customer who had a leak and the roof was ceiling inside was bubbling and they told them to put a screwdriver in the bubble to relieve the water that was building up.  They have great prices and do an excellent job, you don't get that way being in business for over 30 years. I don't ever hesitate to refer these guys as I always get my customers calling me THANKING ME for a Great Referral!!! Keep up the great work Dale and Jason and Company!!!

I have to say I don't know too much about computers. I actually brought my old computer in to Michael at Red7 and before even looking at it, he told me it was junk. I have had others look at it and they have wanted to dump tons of money to fix it. Thanks for being honest Michael. Oh, yeah I also got a new computer there, folks if you haven't dumped windows and got on UBUNTU, free software, you have got to check it out. My girlfriend is the ultimate cheap ass and to have to never pay for another $300 to $500 program, what a relief. Thanks Michael and Red7!!!! Awesome work!!!!

Really like this place. The environment is great, reminds me a lot of Mexico. The food is pretty good and never really had a bad experience here. I watched a show on the Mesa channel on Cox and is displayed the owner, I can't remember his name, but I always love to know who the owner is and the story about the restaurant. I wouldn't say that the food is the best I have ever had, but pretty consistently good. Excellent chips and salsa, the fried ice cream is great, but had the cheesecake, next time I will pass on that, but their key lime pie is pretty good.

I like this place, now I am not a big fan of overly busy, jammed packed restaurants. So I liked that I wasn't waiting for a table too long, even though I think they have the opportunity to do so. I thought the food was great, the service was great and would recommend this place to anyone. Angel, the owner is very friendly and nice. I am excited to take my girlfriend there on Wednesday's for Salsa dancing, which Angel said they started a month ago. Good room for meeting space as well!!!

This is one of my favorite spots to go on a weekly basis or pretty close to. My wife and I go here for the salad room most of the time with a glass of wine and usually a dessert and have never been disappointed. They use to have a more regular staff, but they are pretty good with their service. Never had a bad meal or experience here.

I love this place, I forgot how I found it. Maybe by accident. This place is great. Pizza is awesome, Calzone's are out of this world. They have daily specials we have taken advantage of and I still want to try their LARGE PIZZA, the biggest one I have seen. Very relaxing atmosphere and have always had a great experience.

Wow, I am kinda suprised by the recent reviews of this place. My girlfriend loves this place and has been going for the past 5+ years. She would probably give it 5 stars. I really like this place, the atmosphere, we always get great service. The food is really, really good and the prices aren't bad. Sometimes, very crowded, but haven't ever waited too long. We love going back and can't wait till our next visit.

Yeah, I made it for Taco Tuesday!!! Wow, $1 beef taco's, my girlfriend and I put down 7 tacos with an appetizer. This place was great, very busy and a little loud, but we didn't have to yell at each other to have a conversation. The only bad part is our waitress was a little slow in getting us refill's and we asked for more salsa and didn't get it, but will definately be back for $1 beef taco's.

Oh, YEAH!!! Coming to Scottsdale. I have used RedSeven in Tempe and Mesa and excited to know that they are coming to Scottsdale. I work on the roads throughout the valley and have a lot of customers in Scottsdale that I continue to brag to them about RedSeven's Super Quick Service. Getting the job done quick and right and guaranteed to be the fastest to get you back to work!!!! Oh, and they talk to you so you can understand, not computer talk. Can't wait for Scottsdale!!!!

Well I will start with the good. A friend told me to go there and try their cookie ice cream dessert and it did not disappoint The belly dancers were pretty good too. So then we came back for dinner and our food was cold and they served other before us and the owner wasn't very friendly and was very loud, yelling at employees. So if you like good desserts, give it a shot, but not for a meal, unless maybe they just had a bad night, just one too many for me. A greek brother.

NOW I know why this place was getting bad reviews. Actually I am still not sure because I got great service the first 4 or 5 times I went there and now saw a new owner sign up about a month ago and decided to go there again after being told a 45 minute wait across the street and Zushi was dead and I know why after this experience. They had one waitress on the floor and it took a long time to get her to come over. Ordered and told her no on the soup and she said it was free and still brought it, VERY DISGUSTING!!! Then a large table came in about the time the guy finished making our sushi and she went over and took the other tables order about 15 minutes and they guy didn't bring our food over, the waitress did after 20 minutes after it was rolled. It wasn't even rolled very tight, kept falling apart. I will NEVER GO BACK AGAIN, Unfortunately.  I liked the atmosphere, but seems like the quality of food and service has went down hill.

My wife and I love this place. The only bad thing is not getting a table and getting sat in the crowd of people around the main conveyor belt and prepping station. Most of the wait staff is pretty friendly, there a few who just go through the motions and don't give such a great experience.  We love the sushi here and it is great bang for your buck.

Again I don't like waiting for my food, so when I started going in to this location there was a few seats open at the bar, so my girlfriend and I sat down. The bar staff there was amazing, like more amazing than the regular wait staff there. I am always amazed that they have to memorize the menu, the whole menu and get special long training to be able to work there. I am not sure the bartender's name but he has long hair and is very friendly and definitely a Great Waiter/Bartender, you just don't find many these days. The food is always good, no matter what Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, but I just wanted to comment on the bar staff and their extraordinary friendly and knowledgeable service they offer.

This place is great!!! Michael has been telling me about this place for months and I finally showed and I am glad I did. What a great hang out. I am not the typical big bar, dance club, scottsdale type. So this place for me was perfect. Nice and cozy, very inviting. The owner was there working making sure everyone was happy. It was his wife's birthday, so they had food. Don't know if that is normal, but it was nice to see. I personally like the layout. The prices are second to none, especially in Scottsdale. Definately a must for everyone. Thanks Michael for the recommendation to this place. Great job Brackin's!!!

I have to say that I am a business owner and have the potential of buying a lot of tires, but will not be buying anymore tires from this location and unfortunately they have put a bad taste in my mouth for other Big O Tires locations.  I had Michelin tires on my work van when I went in with a problem and I told the manager that I was working with that I wanted Michelin or Michelin comparable tires put back on. I guess the cheap Big O tire that they decided to put on he thought was sufficient. After 3 months I had one of the tires go out, and had to pay money to get a new tire put on and I decided to upgrade to a Mesa tire. Then 3 months later another tire and you guessed it, even though I had bought the extra insurance another fee to get another tire.  This was a disaster, I have since taken my van and got Michelin's back on at the Discount tire at Greenfield and Baseline location and the sales guy couldn't believe the crap tire that was on. We were guessing that i helped get the Manager a bonus buy selling their crap tire or something.  Big O, You suck and will never get my business and I will shout from the mountaintop how crappy of product and service I was provided.

I came here for a networking event with the Tempe Chamber and this place blew me away, just pulling in and knowing they are that close to In N' Out, j/k. Really though, walking in the door and the talent at the front door was very nice and the layout was great, no wasted space. Very clean, everyone was very helpfull. We got to check out a few rooms and talked price with the GM and Wow, thinking I should put my girlfriends mother there to stay, j/k. Their meeting room seemed to be top of the line, loved all the extras that we got to see, would definately recommend this place to anyone that comes in town. Nice central part of town.

Judy is awesome!!!! Her knowledge of the body and how it works and how to help those nagging pains and aches, is the best I have found. I am an owner/operator of a carpet cleaning company, so you can imagine the work my body gets, Judy has a great touch. She has got the best touch in town when it comes to getting a great massage and I hear from friends that maybe the best feet in town as she does some kind of massage with her feet. She has moved her office to Miller and Indian School, so that will be very convenient. Thanks Judy and keep up the GREAT WORK!!!

Well my dishwasher had a recall. Lucky I was watching 15 news. I went online and directed to the recall and all the dealers that could fix it and went to Yelp and Dino's was the best so I thought I would try them. I asked for the 8-5pm window. Got to love that. Andy the service guy called me the day of and told me that he would be there around 3:30 to 5:30pm. I asked if he could call me closer to the time as I own my own business in the service industry and wanted to make sure I was there for the appt. He called 15 minutes before and came over right around 3:30pm. Andy was very professional, very clean, did a great job. Told me all about Dino's and how great of a company it was, were they were going. As I said I own my own business and work for myself and don't hire anyone because of most service people that come into my house, but Andy is an exception and gives me hope that I might be able to find a worker like Andy who cares that much about what he does and who he works for.  Keep up the great work Dino's!!!!

I have to say that I own a carpet cleaning company and have worked with a bunch of other movers in the valley and there is no other company like Just-In Time Moving. Justin and his crews are outstanding. I have referred him to many of my customers and they have always called back with utter amazement at just how professional and courteous Justin and his crews have been. How reasonable and hardworking they are and it is always nice to know that you can refer someone like Just-In Time Moving & Delivery to your customers without being worried about being embarrassed. Also the customers Justin has referred to me have had nothing but good things to say about Just-In Time Moving and I am not surprised how many have used his service a number of times. Great Job Just-In Time Moving & Delivery.

Troy is the man. I was getting my house painted and was disconnecting my power to my fax, telephone connection and it sparked my outlet and made the wall black, but what I forgot to mention is that we were getting our house painted during this time. So I called Troy, told him the situation and took a picture and sent it to him, he called me back and explained everything he was going to do and he was there early than expected, worked around my painter. Moral of the story.... Troy is a life-saver and I definitely have him on speed dial, wouldn't call anyone else. Thanks Troy!!!!

Well, wow this place is getting slammed!!! maybe rightfully so, but I have never had a problem with their desserts, my girlfriend and I will sometimes go there just for dessert and that is it. We ate there once and they did take a few more minutes than I thought they should have, but wouldn't stop me from going back again.

I was greatly surprised by this place. As a lot of restaurants in this area are closing down, this place opened up 7 1/2 months ago. An older gentleman was working the counter and told my girlfriend and I all about the place, the food and answered all of our questions and even gave us some history on a lot of the foods. Not only did he take our order, but he cooked the food and delivered it to our table, 3 courses and took them away. Some Great Mediterranean Hospitality. This place was a breath of fresh air as we go to restaurants who don't greet us and don't care about us or even have time for good conversation, this place was Great and will be on my dining rotation for sure. I can see myself eating here all the time. I had the Gyro and it was GREAT and even reminded me of when I was a kid in Chicago eating a gyro, it was that good and I helped my girlfriend finish her Veal sandwich, that was so tasty and smelled great.  My ethnicity is part Greek, so I love this food anyway, but this place was GREAT and will recommend it to many people in the future. See you soon. If you are going there for a quick meal, probably not the place, but give it a try, I know you will love it as much as I do.

I have to say that this is one of my favorite places. My only hesitation is that my brother was in Army at basic training in South Carolina and said they are better out there, but still good. So I am holding out a star for a little inconsistency across state lines. The burgers do take a little long, but at least I am not getting a bloody burger, the jalapenos are the freshest I have ever seen and very tasty. The fries are big enough for 2 or 3 people. My girlfriend isn't a burger person and absolutely loves this place and actually recommended we go there one night.

Well I was definitely surprised when eating here. Like many from Chicago, it is hard to find a good quality pizza. I called ahead and told me it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. Surprising, when I got there it was ready. I told them I was going to eat it there since they had a high top, the only one in there ( I think). I sat and enjoyed the best pizza I have had in Arizona to date. It was a thin crust, with cheese, onions, peppers, sausage and I forgot what else because when I finally looked down, it was gone. The owner was in the day I was there and what a nice guy. I love supporting small business as this guy is working hard and is of good quality. We talked for a good 15 minutes, I always like talking to people, especially if I am spending my money, I want to find out what makes them tick and if they are good quality people. I will definitely be back.  Side note, the deep dish looks amazing, just by the pictures. I did read it takes about 10 minutes to prepare and 45 to cook, so I will order in advance. Thanks again and Great Job!!!!

If there is anything I hate is someone charging me when they didn't do a damn thing. My heater part of my a/c went out 2 years ago when we got that freeze. So I called my warranty company and they recommended Wolff Mechanical, so they came out cause no one else was available. Just so happen when they came out, they determined nothing was wrong with the unit eventhough my girlfriend was sick and it was ice cold in my house. They still charged me for the service call, but told me to call them back when it happend again. So less than an hour later, I called them back and they came out and said that everything was fine and was about to leave and I demanded I get some answer. Unfortunately, of course everything was just fine, but I was freezing my ass off and will never call them again and will tell everyone I know never to call Wolff Mechanical.

Ok, so for the most part of the almost 26 years I have lived here in Mesa I never knew there was a Mexican Restaurant at this location. Now I know this is a new owner as of this past January and was under a different name, but come on. I used to go to the Chinese Restaurant right off of Gilbert in the same shopping plaza, this place is kinda hidden, but wow I think you will all like this place.  Once you walk in, it is a bright and colorful decoration, bar to the left and main restaurant ahead and when it cools down a patio out to the right outside the restaurant. Very nicely decorated patio, I must say, I can't wait till it cools down.  On to the food.... I got the tacos and my girlfriend got the chimichanga and that came with fresh salad and fresh meat and vegetables in the chimi. The tacos were just as good. The manager of the place, Everett was probably one of the nicest guys, not fake either, which is a change for the restaurant industry. Cause you know how that goes, How is your meal, folks. Like you really give a crap, just shut up and let me eat in peace. This guy really cared and wanted to help grow this business. He also introduced us to the Michelada con Cervesa, A fancy way of saying adding your beer to Clamato Juice, lime juice, hot sauce, soy sauce and pepper and other seasonings, WHICH was awesome!!! Never would of tried it, Thanks Everett!!!  Good Luck with the place, We will definitely tell everyone we know and recommend this to all. Please drive pass Serrano's and Tia Rosa's and check this place out.  Great flavor, Fresh food and not watery and running all together on your plate, like the normal places.

Wow, What to say about the Hill Group. I have referred work to the Hill Group from a customer of mine, who wanted to use another Realtor because the other Realtor organization was going to give her money to buy a house or something, what I call a bait and switch tactic. I told her of the qualifications that I knew of for the Hill Group and told her that they were the best I knew of. They got her house under contract in 30 days. I have been in their office just to see how it all runs, I tell everyone it is a well oiled machine, There is a reason they are in the top percentile of Realtors Nation-wide, not just Arizona, but Nation-WIDE!!! Keep up the great work Hill Group. OUTSTANDING!!!!!!

I am all about supporting great local businesses and Lo-Fi didn't disappoint!!! Love when the owner is working and you see him everytime, Sam is a great guy and easy to talk to. Serves I think the best coffee in town. Very cool decor, very relaxing. We love stopping in when we are in the downtown Mesa area and even when we are heading in a  different direction. I am telling you, the Coffee is worth it. Good quality stuff!!!! The prices are very reasonable, I was surprised for such a great cup of coffee.  Keep up the GREAT WORK SAM!!!!

I own a carpet cleaning company here in the valley and keep a number of Chris' cards on hand and pass them out to any and most of my customers as often as I can. Chris' knowledge is incredible and he is a good, honest, hard working, straight shooting individual who I am privileged to know and work with.  I refer Chris on carpet, tile and wood flooring sales and installation as well as repairs and stretching of carpet. He is really my go to guy in the carpet industry. If I have a question or need information on carpet, he is my first call.  If you need Chris' services, He is a Must Call!!!!! You won't be disappointed.  What are you waiting for, Call Him!!!!

I own a carpet cleaning company and when I am busy or can't accommodate a customer I am always happy to refer them to Todd at Dunway Cleaning Service. Todd has his son work with him, his father, sometimes his brother. So you get were I am going with this, It is family owned/operated and on the occasion he has close friends work with him. Todd is heavily involved in his business. He has a truck mount steam cleaning system and does a great job. How do I know, cause he taught me. Keep up the Good Work Todd and Dunway!!!

Just went there and was one of the first customers in the door. They hoped to open at 1pm on New Years Eve and opened before noon. Very cool atmosphere, a roll open door and very cool place to hang. You can't go wrong with D&D coffee!!! AWESOME and glad to have them close, we have been putting up with Starbuck's and Dutch Bros, but now we got DUNKIN!!!!

Aweful experience.  Couldn't get anything right from our sandwiches to coffee to a water cup. It pains me to say, but I will never go to this Dunkin Donuts again. If I could give them 0 stars I would. Fire everyone and start again. Never felt so bad for spending my hard earned money.

We have been waiting for this place to open for months. The service has been a little slow, but everyone is trying to get used to the new system. The food has been great, not a complicated menu, very simple. The parking isn't the greatest, but we live close so we usually walk. The owners are extremely nice and friendly and they have a great following. We are actually going there again tonight.

I hate going to this place. I own a business and now I know why the Post Office is losing Millions and Millions, if not Billions of taxpayer dollars a year.  Very few times has this place opened on time, people are walking to open the door at a few minutes after 9am, I did wait 1 time till 9:05am. Most of the time you will get 1 or 2 people who are there to open up front and it looks like they are just getting to work and then 5 or 10 minutes you will get another person, again just getting to work. Oh, and are they just the happiest people in the world and want to work just fast to make the customer happy and do an outstanding job to help make the company more money.  GRRRRR, another reason I hate union and most government employees. I wish I could FIRE YOU ALL!!!
