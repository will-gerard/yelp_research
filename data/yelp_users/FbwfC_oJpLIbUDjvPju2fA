Quite simply this is the best gaming store in the Phoenix Valley. Period. It is clean, well-stocked, friendly beyond belief, well located, and constantly running a vast selection of events. The store is owned and operated by a married couple who make it a point to know their customers well and encourage a merry, welcoming environment. Fully a third of the store is dedicated to gaming space where customers can break out games, play in tournaments, or use the store's impressive selection of terrain for miniature wargames.  Their selection of RPGs is top-notch, with a focus on all the major titles (D&D, Shadowrun, White Wolf) but also includes many smaller lines and the occasional indie-rpg.  For miniature gaming they have an excellent selection of both Games Workshop, Privateer Press, Flames of War, and Reaper miniauters, as well as a variety of historical minis.   Boardgames and cardgames are also well represented and the owners are able to provide fair and accurate reviews of nearly every title in the store. They're not afraid to discourage someone from buying a game that isn't what they're looking for (as they've done so for me) and will make a point of remembering who likes which style of games, to help with birthday gift buying.  If you're a gamer of any sort, you owe it to yourself and your gaming group to swing by Game Depot.

While their prices are good, the low cost is reflected in the quality of service.   They did a good job on my pants but PINNED their tracking label through the cuff of BOTH my dress shirts. $80 shirts with a NEEDLESS hole in the cuff now. When an attempt was made at discussing this with them, the manager pointed out how one of the shirts was 'already pretty worn' and so they wouldn't do anything.  I can not recommend using them anymore, as having needless damage done for the sake of their convenience is unacceptable.

Update: When the management contacted me I went back in to the business and showed them the damaged shirt. He agreed with me and paid me the fair value of the shirt. While I'm not sure if I'll use them again, they certainly did right by me in refunding the cost of the damaged garment.

The Good: I could state a few mediocre points, such as that the office was clean, but they aren't really of any great import.  The Bad:  The doctor only addressed part of my concerns, as I was very interested in seeking help on 2 different-but-related medical issues. Most of his focus was on one issue, with the other being set aside for another time. Though the first visit wasn't rushed, the second appointment did not feel the same.   The doctor seemed eager to use scare tactics during our two conversations, focusing on the possible lethality of a condition, ignoring questions of severity or likelihood. He comes across as patronizing behind a slightly jovial veneer and attempting to scare someone as part of pushing a treatment plan is unprofessional in the extreme.  The doctor suggested I obtain a basic blood test, which could be done via a blood draw at his office. I asked how much the testing would cost (I don't have insurance yet) and was told it would be between $100-200. The doctor was horribly wrong, as the bill was slightly under $500. Though his office did pay part of the bill and help reduce the total cost to me (after I complained), I still paid over $150 more than I had been led to expect.  The Ugly: During my first visit to the office I handed the receptionist my driver's license to be photocopied. It wasn't until 3pm the next afternoon that I realized she'd never given it back to me. When I called back to see if I'd left it there her response was, "Oh yes! We have it right here for you in the desk drawer." Glad it wasn't lost, but if you'd had my card sitting around all day and you HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER, I believe a call back to me would be in order.   In summary Dr. Marks is not a bad guy, but is not a doctor I intend on seeing again. I would not recommend him for your use as a general practice DO.

With a franchise like Denny's I usually expect two things: Reasonably decent fare and reasonably cheap prices. I didn't get either during my visit earlier today. The biscuits were obviously several hours old, the sausage unimpressive, and the hash browns not quite crispy.  Far worse however was the service. I asked for gravy on my biscuits and was cheerfully told she'd bring some out. The waitress then asked if my friend would like ranch with her fries and brought everything out reasonable time. At the end of the meal we saw an extra .50 cent charge for ranch and $1.79 for gravy, which the waitress had neither informed us about, nor did anything about beyond mumbling an "I'm sorry."   I would not eat here again as there are far better options nearby.

The Good: During happy hour (which ends at 7pm) the prices on most sushi are quite reasonable for a restaurant so close to ASU. The quality of the dishes can vary, but I do consider their chefs experienced enough to take a first-time sushi diner here. The selection is reasonably good, though many of the unusual names will have guests double-checking the menu to see what's in an ASU roll or a Wildcat roll.  The Bad: Consistency is NOT common here. I've had evenings where I was promptly seated by a smiling waitress and served delicious sushi within 10 minutes of ordering. I've also been seated and had to ask for service after waiting 15 minutes for a server to stop at my table (during a moderately busy night). During non-happy hour service the menu is considerably overpriced given the quality of the food, service, and dining experience.  The Ugly: The waitstaff are 70% inexperienced while 30% actually know what they're doing. After a poor dining experience I asked the waiter if he could do something to help make it right and was initially given a surly response. He did not offer a solution so I suggested waiving the charge on my appetizer (given that I'd waited so long for service after being seated). The manager did waive my $4 chicken karaage which I felt was appropriate given the poor service and disappointing quality of said appetizer.   If you go:  Go during happy hour or prepare to be overcharged. I strongly recommend trying the seared salmon nigiri and the sweet potato roll. Of my several visits there those have been 2 stand-out experiences in a selection of good, but not great, sushi.

The Good: Top-notch selection, be it in RPGs, miniature wargames, or board games. The store is CLEAN, well lit, well laid out, and is a place I don't feel awkward taking my female gaming buddies. The annual Gamer's Garage Sale is a fun event and while I can't make it to most of the regular events, when I do stop by I always get a good feeling of community from the store. Bonus points for carrying an excellent selection of lesser known RPGs!  The Bad:  Some of the customers from the neighboring Manaworks shop can be a bit on the immature side. I can't really fault Imperial Outpost for their behavior however, and the store has clearly taken pains over the years to discourage anti-social customers from coming around.  Overall: For the west side of Phoenix, this is quite simply your best option for a gaming store. If you are a gamer, or curious about joining the hobby, stop by. Its that simple.

Let's cut to the chase: If you like Asian teas or tea shakes, you should be going here.   The staff? Friendly and quick to make my orders.  The prices? Cheap and a great value for the money.  The atmosphere? Urban, upbeat, clean, and enjoyable.  The desserts? Tasty and excellent for sharing with friends.  Oh, the tea? That's also delicious. They don't have the same selection as some other tea shops, but what they do have is excellent and I've never felt that I lacked for choices.  If you go: A melon smooth with lychee jelly. Trust me, on a summer day you'll thank yourself for getting it.

The good: As has been mentioned before, you're not going to find another gaming store anywhere that boasts 24-hour service or as many open tables. Their selection is top notch for most things, especially miniature gaming and CCGs.  The bad: Sometime in the wee hours of the night the Inn can get pretty rowdy. With a 30-seat LAN, there can be people who might need to go home and shower... Three hours ago.  The ugly: This isn't the gaming store to take your impressionable wife and kids, but if you like the crazed clubhouse feel, it won't disappoint.

The appetizer selection is quite good and ever entree I've had has been flavorful, fresh, and enjoyable. The shrimp & sweet potato tempura is one of the best I've ever had and the noodle dishes and the spicy beef salad is excellent. This restaurant has been a favorite of my family's for quite a while and the only thing keeping them from being a 5-star rating is the occasionally quiet atmosphere and the slightly higher cost for some of their entrees. The service and quality of the food remain top notch.

The Good: The food is flavorful, fresh, and the menu contains a LOT of options. I've taken several different groups of friends here and no one has come away unhappy thus far.  The Bad: The worst I can say is that a few of the wait staff aren't as on the ball as other members of the staff. I've had both attentive service and so-so service here. Definitely good enough to keep coming back, but occasionally a crap-shoot.  Overall: While not a place for elegant dining, no one comes here looking for that. The food is delicious and the prices are absolutely worth it.

Why 5 stars? Because this is one of my favorite regular stops in the East Valley. Of all the restaurants and cafes in Tempe Marketplace, Tea Infusion is the only one I'd choose to make the trip FOR as opposed to simply stopping by, because I happened to already be in the area.  Tea Infusion combines good service, a pleasant atmosphere, the BIGGEST selection of tea falvors I've ever been offered, delectable desserts, and an overall happy feeling. The owner is impressively knowledgeable about her tea selection and can provide excellent recommendations. For those who (like myself) enjoy contaminating their tea with little bits of tapioca, the boba here are fresh and just the right level of chewiness.  If you go I'd highly recommend trying the Cookie Monster tea and a miniature chocolate mousse cake. Both make for an excellent dining experience. If you're a pastry fan or a fan of cute cupcakes in specific you won't be disappointed either.

I was not disappointed by my trip here, even after the stunning review from several of my friends.   The Good: Price-wise this was one of the best options I've ever seen for sushi. Items are served via conveyor belt (if you're sitting at the bar) and plates are color-coded to indicate price. With the plates ranging between $1-$2 each, this is definitely a great bang-for-your-buck restaurant. Between 4 diners we came away with PLENTY of sushi for $10/head.  The Bad: The selection of sushi is certainly far from the largest I've ever seen. Should you be wanting a wide sampling of the cuisine of Japan, this is no the place to go. None of the sushi was gourmet-level, but everything I had was delicious.  I'd highly recommend Teharu to anyone who wants to sample various sushi without comitting to $7-$10 per item. This is also quite the novel change of pace for sushi afficianados looking for a very different serving style.

The Good: This store has hands-down the widest selection of Warhammer, Warhammer 40,000, Hordes, Warmachine, and Flames of War miniatures that I've seen. You'll note I did not say, "That I've seen in Arizona."  No, outside of GenCon or Origins these are THE most miniatures available to choose from I've ever seen in my 18+ years of visiting gaming stores. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the atmosphere of the store is welcoming and clean, and there is AMPLE playspace with lots of good terrain.   I also have to point out that for newer wargamers this store is a great resource on HOW to get into the hobby. The staff aren't afraid to take some time and demo a game or explain how each of the different armies behave on the tabletop. The community attracted by the store is quite willing to help a new player figure out which figures are worth their time or which to avoid.  Finally I'm definitely impressed by the calendar of events that Empire has each month. Usually several large tournaments will be on the schedule as well as weekly league nights. This really creates a feeling of community for the local gamers who attend. They DO carry Magic and run draft tournaments, but I haven't had a chance to attend any of those yet. Reading through a few of their monthly calendars it is clear that wargaming events are the primary focus, with collectible card games coming in a definite second.  The Bad: Parking can be a little troublesome during a tournament, though this is understandable. When I see 30-45 gamers in a store, I know that the parking lot is going to be pretty full. Fortunately the nearby shopping center has plenty of overflow parking a few hundred feet away. Oddly enough Empire does NOT stock Reaper miniatures, my favorite line of character minis or any of the various smaller-name brands. The Ugly: Empire is a focused store. If you're looking for RPGs or boardgames, they DO have a selection but its tiny. What they do have are all excellent games (D&D, Pathfinder, Deathwatch, Shadowrun) or some of the bigger titles (Carcassone, Ticket to Ride, Dominion, and so on), but the non-miniature side of the gaming hobby is NOT where this store's focus lies.   In summary I'd say that Empire is absolutely worth your time if you enjoy miniature gaming or wargames. If you're curious about them, its a great place to toe the water of the hobby and see if you'd like it. If you're looking for a more general game store this won't be your place, though I'd still suggest stopping by just to see a really fun store with a happy crowd.

Simply put, The Grind provided one of the top five burgers I've ever eaten in my life. The peppercorn burger was piled high with toppings and as amazingly flavorful as I'd been told to expect. The service was friendly, attentive, and fast. The food was juicy, flavorful, and reasonably priced. Their hot wings were flavorful and the bread pudding made a grand end to the meal.  Though my initial order was brought out slightly off (with cheese despite my request) they cooked up a replacement in under 5 minutes and had it out to the table in no time. Similarly, when a friend's drink was a bit too bitter for her taste the bartender mixed up a second version more to her liking, but did not charge her any additional fee.  The only downside: I found the fries a tad unimpressive and overpriced. Ah well, not the reason I came here.   If you're near this end of Phoenix I'd highly reccomend giving The Grind a shot.

If you want a tastey noodle dish, possibly with boba tea to follow, this is a great new option for North Tempe. I've only been there once so far, but intend on making this place a frequent stop. They've upgraded a bit since some of the earlier reviews and you can now order cafe items from the main restaurant's register.  The service was fast and friendly, the noodles were excellent, the portions were generous (though the meat could be a little MORE generous, given the price of the dish), and the honeydew milk tea was refreshing.  During the meal the chef came out and chatted with our table a bit. Sounds like they'll be adding more types of noodle dishes to the menu shortly. If you're a fan of Asian noodles, this place is definitely worth stopping in at.

What's the lowdown? Amazingly cheap, amazingly flavorful Indian food well-prepared and served at excellent prices by a friendly and attentive staff.  Oh, you want more? Why aren't you eating there yet?  The only thing keeping this restaurant from being 5 stars is that the atmosphere can be a bit odd at times. High-backed booth seating can make for a nicely intimate dinner date, but the presence of 2 large flat-screen tvs can become distracting for 1/2 of the table (depending on where you're seated within the restaurant).  The staff are unfailingly polite and attentive, as well as happy to explain the dishes for someone not familiar with Indian cuisine. The buffet comprises a very good selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Many of the staples don't change but there is enough rotation that I've never felt bored with the offereings. Beef, chicken, and lamb are all cooked equally well and the various sauces and curries exemplify the flavorful cooking tradition of India.  Back to what's important, I now want Indian for lunch. I hope you're happy...
