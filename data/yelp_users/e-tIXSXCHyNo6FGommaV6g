I have been going here for the past 10 years after getting one too many Great Clip haircuts. I haven't had a bad haircut since I've been going here. A vast majority of the people that work here are mainstays, so you get consistency here. Kathy and Peggy are great people and will treat you right.   The place is always clean and the extra touches are well worth the money. The midway feature is worth the price alone not to mention added assurance that you're getting a quality haircut. I've read a few negative reviews about wait times. I'd rather wait a few extra minutes to get a quality haircut rather than getting in 5 minutes earlier and get butchered by someone who just got their license.   This place is very well run and I like the people complaining about business practices. Listen they've been there 10 years, I think they're doing something right. Take it from someone who's been going to both Athleticuts for the past 10 years. This place is outstanding.

Almost too much to write out but hands down the worst fine out experience in awhile. We went out for dinner for two birthdays. We got seated quick because of the reservation but they was about the extent of it. The place was piping hot and the air conditioning was clearly not working on that side of the restaurant. The waitress kept saying they'd get to it but...  Thanks for the bread and cocktails cause our ordered appetizers came out about an hour later. The waitress told us everything was coming but nothing. Everyone else around us was getting everything they ordered on time. Our appetizer was burnt so they had to make it again. Well about 30 minutes later it came.   Another half hour later our entrees came two hours after we sat down. All 8 plates were cold. The cheese had clearly melted but got cold again. We told the waitress to just pack it up. Pretty simple right? Well she packed up the  wrong meals for everyone at the table. Even the desserts that came with our meal.   We complained to the staff and the meal was free which was good but what a waste of time. This place used to be good and maybe it was just one of those meals, but this was a comedy of errors by everyone who worked at Maggiano's.   Too bad. Go to Avanti's and skip the hype of this place. It's more of an Olive Garden now.

I wanted to commend your staff on the outstanding job they did on my car. Especially, my change holder that they completed cleaned out. Thanks for leaving the pennies and nickels though. I really appreciate that, but the manager Manuel is going to find out who did it. Once you crack that case Columbo come see me for some additional work. Thanks, I can't wait to come back for the free car wash you offered Manuel. I'll make sure I clean out my car of all valuables before I return.

We stopped there cause it smelled so good, but it tasted even better. The owners were there and bought each of my kids rides on their old fashioned mechanical horse. Bring a bunch of dimes for the kids.  Good prices and very kid friendly. I wish I had time for a beer. Great beer selection and great prices per pint. I'll be back.

I brought my dog here the other day to thin out her winter coat. I tried it out since it was it was close to home. I picked up my dog a couple hours later and was pleasantly surprised. This place is great. They thinned out her coat and she looks great. The staff was professional and courteous. They took great care of my dog and I will definitely be back.
