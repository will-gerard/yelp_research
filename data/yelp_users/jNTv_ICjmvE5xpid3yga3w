Home made tortillas!!  Some of the best tortillas I've ever tasted and i grew up in the southwest.  price is cheap too.  i recommend ordering the Oaxaca (pronounced...Wahaka) burrito or the #13 combination plate.  The Oaxaca is filled with homemade chorizo, beans, potatoes and cheese.  The #13 plate comes with a beef enchilada, a beef taco, a bean tostada and beans and rice.  All for about $6.  Also, did I mention their tortillas are that good??  order the butter-tortillas for about 90 cents.  Place is located in the heart of the barrio, but around lunch time you'll find people from all walks of life in there.  firefighters, police officers, academic counselors, business men from corpo america, etc...

Thanks to this place, I can not enjoy Japanese take out food anywhere else in the entire Phoenix area.  This is your mom and pop's style restaurant that gives you much more for your dollar.  The quality and quantity of food that you get at this place is superior than your...let's say than like a Panda Express?    Let's just do a quick comparison of the Orange Chicken. Yoko's: you take a bite out of the deep fried chicken and you will find quality white meat. Panda: you take a bite out of the deep fried chicken and you will find a "what the hell is that??" type of meat.  Enough said.  Also, this is probably the only place you will find handmade gyoza (potstickers) in Arizona.  The owner prepares each gyoza filled with pork/vegetable stuffing and he also makes his own gyoza skin!  he rolls out each gyoza skin by hand, which is a lost art form.  For an order of 5, it'll run you about $6, but they are well worth it.  At other restaurants, you'll most likely find frozen gyozas from costco that are just deep fried.  Again....enough said.

This location (Dobson & Elliot) was one of the first Filiberto's to open in the valley.  I believe (not 100% sure) but it could be the original.  Anyways, this place has changed my life.  The first time I had it was 13 years ago, I was 13 yrs old and in junior high (Hendrix Jr. High stand up!!).  My buddies and I would save our lunch money and come here after school.  A good friend of mine asked me if I like guacamole....ignorant to what it was I replied "no."  Little did I know that this "guac" would change my palate forever.    I started off by eating carne asada.  steak, guacamole, pico de gallo, cheese in a giant, light tortilla. what's not to like?  Then I moved on to the Arizona Burrito.  steak, potatoes, cheese and pico de gallo.  Again, what's not to like?  I was later introduced to the Steak, Egg and Cheese burrito; really good, but now I always ask for this with potatoes.  Which would make it the ultimate breakfast burrito that you could eat anytime of the day.  whenever I need to switch things up, I'll order the chile relleno or the fish burrito.  I know, I know, fish burrito in AZ?  But trust me, the fish is fried to perfection and is really delicious.  If they opened up a fancy sit down restaurant and served their dishes on plates and bowls, they could easily be the best Mexican restaurants in the valley.  I kid you not, I'm a Mexican food connoisseur.  I've lived in the southwest for over 20 years and I grew up with my latino brothers.  I got this...  Other than the carne asada here, the next best would be El Pollo Supremo in Tempe (another Yelp, another day).    Since moving to Honolulu, I've been feeling so deprived of Mexican food.  People could hate on Filiberto's all day, but they are only fooling themselves...Filiberto's is KING in Mexican take out.

with a name like Fat Burrito, I had really high expectations.  I'm not sure how this place exists.  I couldn't even finish my carne asada burrito because it was so bad and I usually can put down anything.  its a poor bootleg version of chipotle, assembly style...but its terrible.  I don't recommend this place unless you want to taste a terrible burrito.

So a couple that we know, experienced foodies might I add, brought my wife and I here to celebrate an occasion.  On weekends they have homemade soul food!!  Prices aren't too bad, for a plate of St. Louis style ribs with two sides will run you about $11.  But make sure you call ahead to see if they have any soulfood left because they do and most likely will run out.    I've been here a couple times since and have recommended all my friends and family to try it.  They have fried catfish, which is pretty good.  Their smothered pork chops are fork tender and simply delicious.  their homemade mac and cheese is pretty legit as well.   They had a live jazz guitarist that plays on Saturday nights.  If you're looking for a great date spot with really good soul food and desserts, come here.    Their dessert menu is extensive...scones, decadent chocolate cakes, rich cheesecakes, etc...all home made and which you can see through a glass window.     oh yeah, their tea is really good too!  try the strawberry white tea, it'll make you feel really relaxed and chill.

The Hob Nob Sports Grill is on of the best places to watch your local sports team in action.  I believe during Suns games they offer half off of their wings (insider tip: order these wings sauce-less and get the sauce on the side, trust me....you won't regret it).    The owners are from the windy city, so if you're looking for a place to watch the Bears, Bulls, Blackhawks or the SOX, this is your place.  The beers are always cold, the liquor is always flowin, the DJ is usually spinnin and maybe if you're lucky, the owners just might let you play some beer pong or WII on the big screen!  I also recommend the burgers here, they hand roll their patties, the burgers are fresh and juicy, just like dad's backyard BBQ.
