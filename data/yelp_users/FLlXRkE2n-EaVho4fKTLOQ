Staff and Doctors were very nice and helpful.  I enjoyed the experience with choosing my frames.  I also enjoyed the frames they carried.  I am a guy that likes more of a sporty look and I loved that fact that they carried some nice Oakley frames.  I will definitely continue to be a patient of their's.

This place is HORRIBLE!!!!!!  I work about a hundred yards away and have eaten there twice now.  The first time the place was empy and it took 30 minutes to get our food.  The second time there were people there but still not full and it took an HOUR and FIFTEEN MINUTES for them to bring out burgers, fries, a pork sandwich,and wings!!!!  Nobody came back to apologize or see how we were doing, and then when we did talk to a manager she was a complete BITCH and offered us coupons for a free fountain drink.  This place is a joke unless you have 2 hours to kill for lunch and enjoy mediocre bar food and bitchy bar managers.  They will never see another one of my hard earned dollars and I hope they do not see of any of yours!!!!
