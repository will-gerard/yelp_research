This target is HUGE! It's very clean and has just about everything here. This would have to be one of the better targets I've been to. I wish though, that the staff would smile more and be more nice. They look irritated all the time! Just smile a little, it won't hurt lol

The half chicken here is huge! They give you a lot of food and it always tastes fresh. The chicken is good but I wish it wasn't too dry. Other than that it tastes good and I really like the amount of food they give you!

This is a real legit theater. Weekends is when its pretty busy, but other than that its usually never busy.   Good for people who like not so crowded theaters.

Very good food here! Pretty good staff, though some waitresses there are a bit too ignorant and rude, overall experience isn't bad when you get past the greet counter in front.

Got my car "detailed & washed" here and let me say it was the worse experience ever! We paid close to 150+ because they said it was going to be an inside and out full detail and clean up and assured me that the car was going to look close to brand new and all. I haven't had my car detailed in such a long time so i was like what the hey lets do it! Well not only it took nearly 2 hours, but when i got my car back, the carpets had a dirty water odor, my car just looked like it got wiped around with grease and the inside wasn't even fully vacuumed. The guys washing and wiping the car wasnt very nice either. We asked him how come the doors looked greasy, like it looked legit with smears of white from the stuff they used. He answered oh your car is prone to grease due to the type of paint. WTH!? No thanks, ill just stick to maybe washing my own car or even te 10$ car washes. They do a better job and they dont talk back.

This place is a great place to enjoy fresh burgers or breakfast! They staff is very friendly and they work very hard to make your order get to you as quick as possible. I enjoy this diner because it gives you that old school feel haha. Definitely will come again! Everyone should try their hamburgers and fries because it tastes so fresh! Definitely a must go to!

Horrible just horrible. This is for a to go order. First off, the wings we ordered were all too salty. It really tasted like it was thrown in a bucket of salt! I was so disappointed. We had ordered extra sauce and veggies and ranch and did not have any of it. When we called in to let them know, the first person to answer was so rude! We were trying to explain what had happened and he cut us off and said do you want to speak to someone. And then just transferred our call. Disgusting! To top that off the manager didnt quite seem all that caring about our bad experience. Will never go here again if they dont change the attitude!

Love starbucks! Service is fast and efficient. I love being able to just drive thru lol! One thing that kinda sucks about this location is that its kind of hard to hear the employee and take your order because you're right at the corner for the stop lights. Other than that, the employees here are very cheerful, nice and polite. Love the drive thru location!

This place is awesome. I am so glad i took my Acura TSX here to get tinted. I got it done the first time and there was a hair that made a bubble on the back window, so i took it back and they fixed it right away. i don't blame this mistake because hey, stuff happens, and nothing is perfect. Though, when they fixed it, it became PERFECTION. Had my tint on for about 2 years plus now and is still beautiful as when i first got it done. They are also real great when it comes to any problems you may have with your tints. Thank you A Better Tint!

I was so scared and nervous to have my colonoscopy done but everyone here made you feel very cared for. I had my procedure done with Dr. Amin and he was amazing. He's so genuine and takes care of you really well. He answers all your questions and makes sure you are doing well even after the procedure. If I have to do this again, I know I will... I will definitely go here again. Great staff!

Wings on point. I ordered take out and it was very fast and efficient. Only thing I'd complain about is the guy taking my order. He did not give me time to just say what I want to have ordered. Keep rushing me! But other than that everything else is good! You win some you lose some! I guess as long as the food tastes great.... :P

Mmm ice cream! This is a tiny place but it has everything there that baskin offers. The ice cream is very good and the smoothies are on point. Staff are nice and don't rush you... Though on dollar scoop Tuesday's you can tell they are stressed due to the line out the door. All In all they are very nice people who run the shop :)

The donuts are really good! They aren't out of this world amazing but they are good and are at a fair price. The service is also just good and not over the top but it isn't really bad either. Cronuts are amazing. And the best time to get the donuts are early in the morning when it's still fresh and soft!

This place is not bad. It has reclining chairs and you reserve your seats, so no fighting over finding seats here lol! One thing is that I feel this place needs to be brought to life. It feels kinda dead but not to the point where there's no business. Oh and if you bring your cup from Harkins you can fill it up for free!   A little hidden in my opinion but I do like this place! :) the area in front has little benches that are cozy, and it is surrounded by a variety of stores :)

I would give this place a 0 star rating but it won't work so anyway, this place is awful. The girls working in there are rude. Talking smack about customers behind the counter. Appalling. I will never go back there again. Worst customer service in the world!

So this was a very bad experience for my husband and I. We came in and it was empty, dark and gloomy feeling. The waitress placed us at a table in the dark! I could barely see my food! All that aside, its a bit pricey. We asked if the 20 something worth had a good decent amount of meat, she said its quite a lot. She brought out the meat and it had only 4 pieces. The rice was really soggy. The table was real sticky. I was just expecting way more out of this place i guess. I think it could of been better if they just clean it up a little bit more, make sure that they give more meet if we are paying 20+... i know meat isn't cheap but wow 4 sorry pieces.. sad sad sad.   Overall i mean, the people seemed nice but it just was not a good experience overall. Hope they can make some adjustments to make it better. It has potential.

This place is ridiculous!!! Never had an issue until now because I usually just run in and grab and go. This time a friend of mine came down and we went here to shop for nail polish and nail stickers. The idiot woman who was working in beauty was all nice in the beginning until my friend needed to use the restroom. She gave me her products before she went to use the restroom and came out and was accused of shoplifting. The dumb manager man was a jerk and was clearly judging before even getting any evidence. He clearly felt like an idiot after the fact that he realized he wrongly accused her. My friend took the product to the woman in beauty and she said to her that she wasn't  interested in buying the product at this store anymore and the lady said "maybe next time you won't put things in your purse!" Damn check your cameras, check everything before you come at us like an idiot! Never going to shop here. Place is run down and clearly has some idiots running the store.

Sushi tasted amazing! We got the medusa, golden California and popcorn shrimp. It tasted very fresh! And they give you a lot! We also ordered the fried calamari but it tasted a little funky. Once you bite into the calamari it had a weird soggy taste to it. Not sure if it's how it's supposed to taste but I never tasted fried calamari like that. The green iced tea was delicious! My husband also ordered himself spicy chicken bowl and it tasted amazing! Overall not bad and definitely will be back! :)

Sushi... Tastes...so...good!!! I love the variety they have. Sushi always tastes fresh and flavorful! I love the popcorn lobster roll, I think that's what it's called. They give you a lot and it just tastes so amazing. You can tell they don't give you old fish with your sushi.   One thing I'd have to complain a little about though is their service. Not because they aren't nice, but because they have a problem communicating with each other and mess up orders. I live about 25 mins away and had to run back a second time to pick up almost half my order because it was wrong or they didn't give it to me at all. But! They do fix their mistakes and they give you extra goodies when they mess something up. I like that. It's fair for your inconvenience.   All in all, great restaurant and great food!

I am not sure what has happened to this restaurant but the service is horrible. I have been here numerous times with my family but for the past couple times I've been out here its been so terrible. They don't offer you free water anymore as you wait, the people there look miserable, they aren't personable as before, and the food tastes bland. I really feel that this place has some personal issues because the service speaks for itself, horrible. I am definitely searching for a new place to take my family to eat pho.

Sushi was alright. Wasn't the best but it was decent. The pricing was not too bad but not too great either. The atmosphere was nice and cute. Though, the service was just ok. They aren't really personable. They were more like hi what u want , ok here you go, ok bye. lol. But overall it is okay and I would go back again.

This place is ridiculous! I went in to get a smoothie and there was no one there except me and the two friends of the employees there. They finally noticed me and asked me what I wanted, made it and the guy just put his hand out for money when he did not even tell me what the amount was. This happened on September 1, 2014 at about 230pm. Unprofessional and will not be going back to this place!!!! Horrible! I hope management sees this and does something.

Very good place to find some of that asian goods. I love that there are a lot of stores within the grocery store. It really helps the place have more life to it. The only thing I'd say badly is that I wish there were a lot more selections. They basically have what lee lee supermarket doesn't have. But definitely loving that they kept the 10% discount !!

Food is  good but it is only better on occasion. I feel that sometimes the cashier ladies aren't happy and take it out on you if you don't make a speedy order. Overall the place is very neat and clean and great to sit back and enjoy some lunch but I'd say it would be superb if the staff was more energetic. Though, food quality in a sense is what is probably keeping this place alive.

Christine is just amazing! Ranging from her personality to professionalism she is definitely a gem! All us asian gals, we all know the pain of getting a bad haircut for our super straight, curly, etc type hair. Christine did an amazing job. I gave a picture and she gave me advice. She didn't push it on me, she asked me if what she advised worked for me. What i loved when i first came in was that she called me and greeted me by my name. Btw this is the first time meeting her so it was refreshing to know she took time out to take down notes and remember me after i called for an appointment. She listened to my needs and i came walking out with a great haircut. She is definitely amazing and i am so thankful to have had her do my hair! Hope she doesn't leave this place!

Not a bad place at all. The prices for meals and such aren't bad. The food tastes great and the ice cream... They make a tower for you. The employees working here are very nice and they usually make sure you have everything you may need. Try the fish and chips! It's not bad!

What can i say? This company provides excellent and polite service to its customers. Towing is always going to be another hole in your pocket but this company gives pretty good rates. We were served by a driver named Bryce and he was awesome! He was not only as fast and efficient as he could be but he was very nice and sympathized our car troubles. I will definitely be calling this place again if i ever need to be rescued :). Thank you for everything phoenix towing!

Being a thai girl growing up on thai food this place is amazing. You know how it is... Nothing beats home cooked meals but this place is close! Love the waiter there. He has his special sauce and entres you should all try. Very nice staff and very great service. We tried eating there at lunch and dinner times and was always busy. Definitely a great place to get some thai food! Take advantage of their coupons! It is a bit pricey but worth it if you're hungry! Try the Thai tea :)

The food is okay. It doesn't taste that fresh if you come late. The employees there need a smile and a hug. They are rude. My mom and I sat there and was waiting for my husband to get a to go duck and chicken. An employee walks by and kept staring at our table just to tell us that the bill didn't include a tip and that we should tip then. They didn't even deserve it. Came by our table ONCE didn't ask us if we needed more water or anything else. Appalled. Finding somewhere else to eat dim sum.

Pretty good food, service was great, and had a blast! So glad to have had good company while enjoying the entertainment of our cook at the grill. Only complaint was that the food had a little too much soy sauce or whatever sauce they used that made it salty... But other than that it was amazing! Definitely will come again :)

I go here all the time for my brows! If you can, see Senita. She is awesome and very nice. She is a bit rough when she threads but she gets it done right. Just explain everything to her in the beginning and she will do it how you like. She basically runs the shop because I've never seen the owner there once! Hands down only reason I go is because of how good Senita is at threading.

Park is pretty big. They have a small dog and medium and big dog side. The set up is good. Large play area for the dogs to run around. Only thing is that people still don't know how to clean after their pets! Smh... But other than that there's good space for dogs to roam freely. Also the park is pretty big as well so if you just want to walk around it's pretty nice as well.

Really liked this gym. At the time that I had done fundamentals it was in the process of getting painted and fixed up. The coaches here, Apollo and Ryan are incredibly nice and really do motivate you to be the best you can be. I would have stayed but the price is too much for me, and my husband, and I just simply could not afford it.If I could, I would definitely stay! With that being said, if you have the money go HERE. Most of the people at this gym are pretty nice. All in all, this will help you become powerful and show you, you are capable of doing much more than you thought :)

It's so hard to find good legit Chinese food but I absolutely love this place! It's a bit of a drive from where I am but it's worth it! My husband and I go here and get good affordable food! It's a family owned restaurant I believe, and it's usually not too packed but most people order take out here instead of eating here. They give you good amounts of food, but a little less on the rice... But still ... Plenty of food. I could never finish haha! The generals chicken and honey sesame chicken are my fave :)!

Loved this healthy alternative for dinner! Went in with my best friend to eat and chat. Atmosphere was great. Had fun being able to enjoy healthy food and just hang out. I had the chicken pesto sandwich and it was really good! Also ordered the clam chowder. It was good but i had better. It was a bit plain to my liking but it wasnt horrible. I loved that they had a lot of varieties of foods there and even delicious looking dessert! Will go again :)

Great tasting pho and staff is very friendly!!! We came here after having a bad time at pho van near Lee Lee. Hoping for a more friendlier atmosphere and better food, this place delivered. I am glad that the waiter there, whom came from Seattle was very approachable and attentive to everyone as best he could. We had pho with chicken, bun no hue and pho with meatballs. All were flavorful! Only thing I'd say is that if the additional items are going to cost $2 add more than 3 pieces please!!! Will be going back.

Staff is very nice as well. Very upbeat and a great place to hang out. Wish they can expand though, it is a bit tight when there are a lot of people. But everyone doesn't mind to cram inside to grab delicious drinks! Yum!!!

So  we just had our AC "repaired" and its still doing the same thing it was before. Blowing warm air then blowing cold, then blowing warm again. The tech guy that we had was very unfriendly. He did not even make or TRY to make conversation or even explain to us what is wrong with our ac or why it was doing what it was doing. I think if you are going to fix something for someone atleast explain what the issue is so your customer understands what is going on! From the reviews so far, it looks like its just that one tech guy that is not quite loving his job and is giving a nasty experience to this company's service. Need to find somewhere else who will not only do a better job but will take care of their customers better than this.

Came here because its pho weather Lol. So, overall the pho was delicious. The broth had lots of flavor and they had generous amounts of meat. A few things why I didn't give 5 stars. The drinks, any kind from soda to Thai tea, tasted horrible. Soda drinks tasted old... Thai teas tasted like powder. I also thought the service could be worked on a bit. The guy clearly was paying attention more to the "regulars" than us. Also, the interior is standard but not bad. Overall if it wasn't for the good pho, it would have gotten a lesser rating. Will definitely be coming back for pho but may bring my own drinks Lol.

Food is good, not great depending on what you order. Some of the shrimps and snow crab and crawfish were either too salty or did not have much flavor. The staff are very very nice though! Fried calamari and onion rings and fries were amazing. I'd just try to get the flavor right, or maybe it was just this once. Overall very good and will be back.

I really like how cute this place looks. Its simple and amazingly refreshing to walk into. I like the decor and feel of this place! The cake bites are a tad bit too sweet for my liking but it tastes great. The cupcakes are good as well but a bit too sweet. If the sweetness were taken down a little i think id enjoy it better. I tried the strawberry shortcake cupcake and the frosting was a little too much for me but overall it wasnt horrible. My husband had the cupshake and he said it was good but mentioned they should provide a bigger straw because it was real hard to drink it when the chunks of the cupcake were clogging the straws. I gave only 4 stars due too it being overly sweetened but i would definitely come back again!!! The pricing wasn't cheap nor too bad.

Came in for a hair cut today. I got a haircut with Julie. She is very nice and did a great job. She didn't talk to me much. maybe because shes a bit older and there isnt much conversation to do lol. Not exactly what i wanted with my haircut but it wasn't bad at all.  This is a cute little place and very nice and chic inside. Wish they had some music or something on though. Very very quite, i was falling asleep lol. It is kind of in a somewhat deserted lot, but not too deserted!   The girl at the front desk is very nice. She was kind of struggling maybe due to being new?   All in all, this is a good place to go and get a haircut. They also have a mini nail corner if you want to get your nails done. The owner Renee is very nice, i can see why most people call in and request her. Shes more talkative :)  Pricing is not bad at all.

Place is very nice and clean and pretty! Love the way the restaurant looks and feels. Its a relaxing environment that allows you to enjoy lunch or dinner! The hours they open are from 11-3 then reopens at 5-9. The service is wonderful and staff is very friendly. Gotta give them some slack these first few weeks as they are learning and coordinating their routine but overall they are  doing great. Will come again! Try the coconut ice cream!!!

Just brought my little pup in today to get nails trimmed. The price is 10 dollars, cash or check only. The owner, I believe it was her, is so sweet!! You can see the levels of care she has with all the pets there. I will definitely be coming in again for my pets nail trims and even grooming. I believe it's a pet boarding place as well. All the dogs in there looked so chill and happy. They didn't look frustrated or scared. They all were very obedient when the owner spoke to them. They respect her :)

Oh my gosh! So good! So fresh! I can't get over how fresh the donuts are here. We got a dozen at 1030 and its 9 pm and its still soft and fresh! The owner is so sweet and nice! She really gives a refreshing first impression. I have been trying to find a local place to get donuts and I can definitely say I'll be coming here from now on! I love the variety of donuts! Variety is big to me and I am glad she makes different fun donuts to eat! Come here for fresh donuts!!!

The food here is okay. Nothing special really... But it's not bad either. Pricing isn't too bad as well. The staff are super nice and the setting feels like another Denny's but very clean. I believe they are fairly new to the area and convenient from where I live. They are in front of the target. The eggs were a little too gooey for me but everything else tasted fine. All in all not a bad spot to go eat, and it has a very upbeat vibe.

Very cute place! I like the cute decor and vibe of this place. Place is a bit tiny and tight but not too bad. Good place to just hang out. We came in and they were just about out of everything lol... No coffee no Thai tea, no boba... But we tried the fruity drinks. Forgot what they were called but they had the popping boba and it tasted real fresh and fruity. I definitely would recommend this place. It is a bit pricey but it's not too bad. Overall pretty good.

Food tastes pretty great! Less greasy than Panda Express. The delivery time was quick. They employee delivering was nice too!   Food tastes good. I had the sesame chicken and fried rice. The rice tasted a bit different but it was bad. However, the sesame chicken tasted very good! I'd like more chicken in there though. They give a good portion for a decent price. I'd eat here again :)
