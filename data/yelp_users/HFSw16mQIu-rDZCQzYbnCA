I can't rate the food - the people at the counter were so rude to me that I decided to leave before ordering.    Is this part of the "Essence" of this place?

I love this place, I have tried several things on the menu and have never had something I didn't like.   The seafood is fresh, and there are a lot of options for preparation. If you are unfamiliar with something, dive in and try it!  Plus:  The servers are always friendly.  Food arrives fast and hot I have been there a couple dozen times, and there is always something I haven't tried yet.  Minus:  The music can be REALLY LOUD. Being a nerd, I started the decibel meter app on my phone - it reached 101 decibels at times! I found this on Yahoo Answers: "100 decibels, equivalent to a chain saw, pneumatic drill, printing plant, jackhammer, speeding express train, some car horns at five meters, farm tractor, riveting machine, some noisy subways [about 20 feet]." So yeah, the other reviewers are not exaggerating when they say it's loud in there.   The lighting is super bright fluorescent bulb style. These 2 things combine to make this not the place for a relaxing dinner after a long day at work. It's more of an adventure, so find something you haven't tried yet, shout out your order and enjoy that michelada!

I'm conflicted. I've been here before and enjoyed it, but took a friend there this morning and was pretty disappointed. Gave the friend the big build-up so was a bit embarrassed by the poor showing.   We ordered 2 Plain and Simples and they showed up pretty quickly. So far so good. However, the food was not hot, the bacon was undercooked and the potatoes were way overcooked. Not sure how the potatoes were overcooked, and still served at room temperature - but that's how it was. To cap off my experience, I found a long hair on my plate. I'm not squeamish, but I gotta say, "yuk."  Restaurant 101: Someone needs to scrutinize every plate before it leaves the kitchen. Is the food hot? Is there a big friggin' hair in it?   We were the first customers on a Sunday morning, the cooks were probably hung-over college kids.   Oh, and while I'm at it - the coffee was weak and nearly devoid of flavor.  I'll be downtown in a few weeks, so will try it again and revisit / revise this review in the interest of fairness.  UPDATE: Went back a few weeks later, and it seemed to be back to it's usual quality. Would probably go again.

I was skeptical of the fast style carwash - but my truck came out looking great! The free vacuums are nice too.

Love this CF gym. The coaches are really involved and there's a big emphasis on form, mobility and avoiding injury so you can train for the long term.   The facility is very basic - but all the essentials are there. I like it that way, the foo foo gym with the latest ellipticals etc is not my cup of tea.   There is also a good community here, that is a welcome change from other gyms.   I am pretty new to CF - so I may not be the best reviewer, but I really like the feel of Crossfit 602.   Keep up the good work 602'ers!

I took my dog to AZ Canine Center while I was on vacation, and I think she had more fun than I did. When I got her home she was happy and very tired. (A tired dog is a good dog!)  The facility is big, bright and clean and I felt very comfortable leaving my girl there. The owner showed me around and let me know that someone would be on-site 24/7.  The boarding area is cage-free - the dogs get to run and interact with other dogs the entire time they are there. At night they sleep in a cuddle puddle on one of the couches.   One tip... call ahead and set up a time to bring your dog in for an orientation. They need to be sure they have suitable temperament for living cage-free with other dogs.
