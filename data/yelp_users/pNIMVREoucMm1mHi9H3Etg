The food is pretty good, especially good for vegan fare, they've got a decent gluten free menu set up too!  Problems are in the service, since the start of summer 2011 it has gone way downhill. Today I waited for 35 min for my food, had other people who ordered after me served, then when they finally noticed me, they came over and told me to come up and ask if my food is taking too long. Isn't that their job to serve in a timely manner? Since when do I pay $10 for $4 worth of food to not get served?  On top of it, they screwed up my order, I had to go back in and get it fixed (more waiting time). Being late, being stupid, and being wrong? Three strikes in one visit - this place is done.   I won't be going back.

Went on a Monday night to meet two friends for dinner - parking is very limited and there are no available overflow areas close by.   Promptly seated, server did a good job, menu had a number of Gluten Free options (important for me!) friends got salads, I got a gluten free pizza. Salads were good, Pizza was good, if a little rubbery.   Bill came to about $45 for the 3 of us, which was totally reasonable. Would definitely recommend this place!

Had a reservation for a large party on Sunday afternoon for lunch - had 5 tables which were served by individual waiters. Had to wait a very long time (about 30 min) before the waiter came by to take our drink order, ordered food at the same time.   Didn't see the waiter again until the food came, got a vegetable frittata which was very undersized for what it cost ($11) but did have good flavor and was gluten free as noted on their menu.   Never saw the waiter again until bill time, and I had wanted a second drink. At that point, every single person at the other tables had paid and started leaving before our waiter even came back to give us our bills. Worst part - I was automatically charged an 18% tip for terrible service.   While i understand that waitstaff should be fairly compensated for handling a large party, this waiter was responsible for 2 tables, not a very hefty work investment. That I couldn't elect not to tip when given bad service was an insult on top of it all.

Best fast food burger join in phoenix - can get busy at lunch time, but they have always gotten my order right!

Eaten there several times - been sick feeling after 3 of them. Not a clean place, service is slow and with the exception of a few beer specials the menu is overpriced ($8 for a dozen overcooked wings?)   Had hope for them to get better after they remodeled about a year ago but I won't be giving them another chance.

I have been involved in martial arts a long time, and currently am an instructor in my own right. My quote to the owner of Sitan Gym after my first class was "I've been walking around thinking I'm pretty good for years... then i came here." Their fitness preparation and conditioning blew away anything I had done previously.  Their instruction is top notch and they are verifiably legit as their fighters compete often, and often win. I am very proud to be able to say I trained there for a short time.  If you want to learn straight-up Muay Thai in Arizona, this is the place to go.

A great little bar with a selection of Gluten Free Beers!   Went in there with a large group of 40+ people, staff were a bit sassy at first (I asked for a liquor drink which they don't serve - beer and wine only) but handled the large crowd really well.   Prices were reasonable, and I found some new GF beers - can't go wrong, right?

A nice but cheap asian food place - they combine dishes from japanese, chinese and other asian cuisine. Have eaten there 4 times now and can say that it's reasonably good for a cheap price.   Though I am limited when eating there due to a gluten intolerance - the chef and server have been very kind to help me find dishes that work for me and have been willing to modify dishes when necessary to help me out.

I really wish this place was better - at first glance it's a gluten free diner's dream (I have celiac). Having eaten at Nourish on 3 separate occasions, it's decidedly "meh."  The menu is nicely varied and has a number of excellent options for anyone with specialty diet needs. I really applaud the owner for putting this place together - though the space is somewhat oddly shaped (the entryway is not inviting) they do have an OK decor.  The service however is the breaking point - it is very poor. The food has gotten to me cold 2 out of 3 times, we were rarely checked on by server and they were very slow to get the bill 3 out of 3 times. During lunch hour time is of the essence for working individuals, this is obviously not a priority at Nourish. Additionally, price/amount of food ratio is out of whack on a few dishes, nobody likes to spend a lot and walk away hungry.   They have promised a new menu beginning in April 2011, I hope some of these problems will be addressed then.

Went to go to cheeburger-cheeburger and found out they were out of business, so gave it's replacement, Stella's Kitchen a try. Decor has changed to a more modern red/black theme from cheeburger's 50's diner feel. Overall, it seemed pretty nice on first viewing.  Service was ok, however they screwed up my order (i have a gluten intolerance, i notified the server and asked for my burger without bread, and it came on a bun). Also, my friend ordered a sandwich and asked that they leave the tomatoes off, to which he received the reply that they don't make the food there, it's shipped in frozen and they can't alter the sandwich.   Food wasn't terrible (fries were pretty good) but to be served frozen food reheated and not be compensated even slightly for screwing up my order in a way that makes it inedible to me (and for over $10 a plate) is a little much. I won't be going back.

To those of us recent and longtime sufferers of either wheat allergy or celiac disease this place is a godsend. Their breads, bagels and donuts are way beyond anything I've been able to get at either whole foods or sprouts.   As other reviewers have noted they have several sandwiches they can make for you and every one I've had is good. By far my favorite is the philly cheese steak.  Additionally the staff is very friendly and helpful, and the decor of the bakery is bright and cheery. I cannot recommend this place enough!
