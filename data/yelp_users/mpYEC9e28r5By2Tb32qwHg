I saw today that Babies R us is offering a 20% off on ALL Glider and Ottomens, Which is fantastic! Except for the fact that I also noticed that they have not only increased the prices of both but a COMBO that I was looking at on January 4th 2012 and saved the link to (Which no longer works) is now not available as a combo (Actually there aren't any combos available) and is now priced at a total of almost $400 (Originally $239.98 for both).  So that got me thinking (Though I LOVE BABIES R US)- do they usually jack up their prices when coupons come out and try to make more money and pull a fast one....Ummm!  I will be following up on this!  I called Shermag (French Company) and hopefully they will return my call.

I LOVE the food here!  I think that they need to probably work on turning the tv to some thing everyone would enjoy and keep it off of Roping- Not to keen on that. Also as much as I love kids there are sometimes when you don't want them running through the dining room.  All in all the food is great but don't expect it to be a quiet romantic dinner :)

Wasn't that impressed.  They were "out of" sausage gravy though if it's homemade that's super easy to make.  Eggs and sausage were all over cooked.  The potatoes were bland!   They are way over prices with the specials also... $16.99 for one breakfast plate!?!?! We were told they didn't have any forks because they were in the dishwasher- (take one out and wash it by hand).  The vents are disgustingly dirty which makes me question everything else.  Won't be coming here again, which is a bummer since I really wanted to support a local deli. :(

NASTY- MOLD--- GROSS!!!!   Everyone was standing around talking when there was Plenty to be cleaned everywhere!   The food was- regular food.  I went to put ice in my toddler sons cup to get some water and there was MOLD all over the ice spout!  I showed the manager- they put an "out of order" on the machine but then decided to mop the floor instead of cleaning the machine. Mind you this is the floor that they would need to stand on to clean the machine!!!  Will not be back here- if something as simple as the soda machine is nasty, what else is nasty in this place!  GROSS!!!!!

Eggs were over cooked, potatoes were bland, biscuits were dry and seemed like they were two days old.  Eggs Benedict was Sour!  No refills offered on any drinks, had to ask them to Pre-bus the table  Butter was extremely salty!  When we told the waiter that our food "wasn't as good as expected" he said "can I get you something else?"  I said "no, it's fine" (had two small kids with us-didn't have time) he then said "I hate that word (fine)" and walked away.  They did discount our bill which is why I even have them 2 stars.

We read the bad reviews and were reluctant to try this location but we are glad we did!  Though we did not order chicken, we ordered a thin crust super supreme pizza and side salads. The side salad was a great size, possibly big enough to feed two people, the pizza was so good and hit the spot.  The waiter (Danny) was really attentive and made sure that everything was perfect.  Joked around and made it very comfortable.  While we were here they received multiple phone orders and they were very professional and polite each time.  I highly recommend you try this place out!

This place must be under new management or something, we have been here a few times and it's always been pretty good! Today we came in and not only was the food mediocre at best but, the customer service was horrible.   No greeting when we entered, then as we got ready to order they told us for an extra sauce it would be an additional $1... Once the sauce came it was about a tablespoon possibly less... For $2, I could have bought a BOTTLE of plum sauce!  Then they yelled at our kids because they were STANDING by the fire alarm, they were not touching it at all just standing there, you don't yell at my kids especially if I'm standing right there watching them, they were fine!   So, we ordered the Indian Butter Chicken, it was NOT at all the same as before, it was bland with very little sauce!   I ordered the Singapore cashew chicken, it was pretty good (the only reason for the 1 star).  We also ordered a kids Chicken which came with about 1/4 of the rice as normal and the chicken was super dry!  We had a stamp card that they stamped once, when asked why the one stamp and not three the "cook" came and said "actually you shouldn't have received any", apparently you have to order the regular size and not the lunch, which is fine but speak kindly and explain that, no need to be rude!   Had we not had two hungry kids we would have went elsewhere.  Won't be coming here again!

Great coffee, tried the Sugar Cookie Latte and the Red Velvet latte- both were amazing!   We also tried the turkey sandwich, Cuban sandwich and the chicken noodle soup- all were AMAZING!!  Becky is so sweet and made us feel like we were at home, she was very personable and just someone you can chit chat with while enjoying your coffee and sandwich!   Their coffees are a proprietary blend and you can definitely tell they took their time selecting just the right coffee beans! Wish this place was closer to my house but oh well, we will definitely be back soon!  I highly recommend you try this place it!
