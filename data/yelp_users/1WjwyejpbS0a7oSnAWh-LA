Just revisited the Oceanside Ice Arena. New glass, new bleachers and new paint. What a treat. Good ice but still no restaurant.  All around good experience.

It was very difficult placing my order as the person on the other end of the phone did not speak very good English.  However, with two different toppings on each side of the pizza, they got the order correct.  The pizza was delivered sooner than expected and was very good.  I would recommend Rosatis for a good pizza pie.

Great food here at Reds as well as a fun atmosphere.   I highly recommend the fish.  Best fish and chips I have ever had.  Lightly breaded with tempura.  More fish than breaking.   My son loves the BBQ beef burger.  Bring your putters as there is a putting green adjacent the patio seating.   Great place and lots of fun.  Ashlee was a great waitress and a lot of fun to be around tonight.  If you can sit in her section you will enjoy the experience.

My wife and I played the Gold course.  Greens were in excellent shape and rolling pretty quick.  Winter rye grass everywhere.   Course was in great shape and the fee ($60.00) after 1:30 was a bargain for this championship golf course.   The course was redesigned a bit and fairway bunkers were removed to make the course more user friendly and to speed up play I'm sure.  I would highly recommend The Wigwam Gold course for a good challenge.

Go anywhere but here.  My wife and I went to the Barrel Grill last week for dinner and after sitting at the bar for over 10 minutes with not even a hello from the bartenders we decided to leave.  Not only until we got up and started to walk away did the staff recognize us. At that point it was too late. Unfortunately for us this was the second chance we gave the Barrel Grill.  The first time the wait before being acknowledged was just as bad however we continued to wait.  The food was okay but not worth the wait and very poor service.  That being said we will never give the Barrel Grill another opportunity.

What a great breakfast restaurant.  I love the fact you can order different types of Benedict to try each one which by the way were incredible.   I liked the food so much on my first visit I have been there three more times and make this my Saturday morning breakfast stop.  They have a very big menu with quite a few different breakfast options.   So farming my four visits I have had excellent service and excellent food.  Now it is finally warming up so you can enjoy the patio seating.  I highly recommend Snooze for breakfast.

Snooze is my favorite breakfast spot.  The food is not your traditional breakfast recipes.  Everything is made with a flare which is just delicious.   It's so hard to decide what to order each time because it is all so good.  I only wish they offered a sample plate so you can have a little of everything.  They actually offer the eggs Benedict that way singly can order two different types.  I recommend the Chile Verde Benedict and the Bella Bella but if your a potato lover the Snooze spuds are awesome either the pulled pork and jalape√±os.  Never a bad meal here.

New restaurant in Surprise in the old Hayashi building that closed down. Started off poorly by being seated in the back of the restaurant in a secondary dining room where they stacked the glass trays they put in the dishwasher.   Problem is there was plenty of seating in the main dining room where there was much more light and life.   We requested a seat change and they obliged.   Much better seating in the main dining room.  Good atmosphere.   Still some old Hayashi decorations hanging around so some more work to be done.  The food was very good.  Had the best salad and the grass fed burger.   Both were excellent. I would not recommend the homemade ketchup or the "fancy sauce".   My son had the fish and chips which were really good but they had no malt vinegar.    They just opened 3 days ago so still trying to work out the kinks.  Wait staff was very nice and punctual.  All in all I would recommend State 48 Brewery and will definitely give it a second try.  Well I've been waiting for 15 minutes after giving the server my credit card.    Also forgot to mention how random the decor is.  They are rocking about 4 different styles in here.
