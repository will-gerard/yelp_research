The Magic Wok is hidden in a strip mall with Bashas at the corner of Warner and McClintock.  It's facade may not be the most appealing, and the same goes for the interior of the establishment as well.  That being said, they have the best Chinese Food in the Valley, and this is coming from someone on the East Coast.  If you're from back East, you know how hard it is to find good Chinese.  After 10 years of living in Arizona, I was resigned to the fact that I would have to settle on mediocre Chinese Food.    Words do not do this place justice.  We've since moved out of their delivery range, and it's now roughly a 30 minutes drive to their restaurant.  We tried three of the local Chinese Food take outs by our new house, and not one has come close to replacing the Magic Wok.    If you love Chinese Food it is worth the drive, even if they do not deliver in your area.    Taste:  Exceptional Value:  Fantastic Portions:  HUGE Service:  Very Friendly (Family Owned & they always smile and ask how you are doing) Highly Recommended

Absolutely the best place to get a haircut in Arizona!  I'm making another appointment to see Chelsea today.  I was in need of a haircut, and was tired of going through the process of finding someone to cut my hair.  I tried local barber shops and salons, from Great Clips to high priced salons and regardless of where I went I always left disappointed.  I finally checked Yelp, and saw the reviews of Arizona Hair Co in Tempe, and decided to give it a shot.  The reviews were spot on!  5 plus stars!  I can't say enough about Chelsea, and the fabulous job she did.  I have and will continue to highly recommend them!  Thank you again Chelsea!

Two years and counting, and I'm still coming back to Arizona Hair Co.  I'm thankful I checked Yelp, and even more so that I came across Chelsea.  She is one of the best.  Very professional, friendly, and is knowledgeable about all the different cuts and styles.    I love how I can sit down in the chair and trust her to give me the best haircut.  She knows which cuts work with your profile.  If you're looking to get a haircut today, call and all for Chelsea.   I promise you won't regret it.

If you have experienced the cookies at Paradise Bakery you're probably hooked.  While you can find several locations throughout the valley, the one on Germann and Gilbert is by far the best.  What sets this location apart from the rest is the staff.  It is apparent that they love their work, and they greet you with a sincere smile.  In this day and age it is rare to find employees that consistently offer superior service, and make you feel that they are truly honored and grateful that you choose their restaurant.    As for the location itself it is well kept and clean, and the food is fresh and always top notch.    So the next time you have that rumble in your tummy, treat yourself to Paradise Bakery.  And don't forget to take home a few cookies...the one that you get with your meal will have you craving for more when it's gone.

Does it matter what towing company you use?  Before my experience with Quik Pik I would have said no, "They're all the same."  Unfortunately that is definitely not the case with this company.   The driver, David, was rude and abrasive,  suffering from some inferiority complex that made everyone around him cringe.  When I called the main line to voice my concerns and express my issues with his conduct and professionalism,  I was dismissed.     I cannot stress enough or warn others to avoid this company.   I would rather push my car over 100 miles in the middle of an Az record breaking scorching summer, burning my hands in the process,  than call these incompetent, negligent "tow specialists."

I'm a huge fan of Barro's pizza, and I have to say, this location is back!  They made a couple of changes to the way they make their meatballs and its spot on!  Fantastic customer service, great managers, and nothing less than the best pizza anywhere!  If you haven't tried Barro's pizza, do yourself a favor and place an order tonight!  Thank you again Barro's - one very happy and loyal customer!
