I have been a lucky patron to Giant Hamburger for nearly 10 years. It doesn't get any better. I have experimented with other burgers but they always dissapoint after experiencing this place.   Probably the biggest competition for them right now is Five Guys. Five Guys is good. No doubt about that but Giant Hamburger easily beats them.   Also, Giant Hamburger has delicious, flavorful and crispy fries that shadow most competitors.  I recommend getting a green chili on your burger. Just a thought. It isn't on the menu but they are happy to accomodate.  Speaking of accomodations. This isn't the most fancy place. It has 4 walls, about 10 booths but fancy is not the intent. This is a burger joint. The employees hardly ever turn-over. If ever. So they are all experienced and have great attitudes.   Writing this made me hungry for another Giant Hamburger. I can't wait to go again!

I used to shop there frequently. I usually found what I needed. The prices were competitive and the employees were helpful.   Lately however (probably 4 visits in the last year) I have left annoyed by the service. The employees are rude and unfriendly.   I will try again in another year or so and allow turnover to, hopefully, bring in some friendly and courteous employees.

This was not in my neighborhood but my archery instructor recommended it. He advised it had a wide selection and a helpful and knowledgeable staff. We decided not to go the internet route or the big box store route, based on his suggestion. In hindsight, I totally disagree with his advice.   He told me they had a large selection of recurve. Not true. They do have a large selection of compound bows but recurve selection is very limited. They did have some quality recurve bows at competitive prices. They did not have exactly what I wanted but advised they could have ordered for me. This did not matter because I decided to walk out due to poor service as described below.  My friend and I are both taking up this hobby at the same time along with my wife and daughter. My friend and I were ready to make some big purchases. I told the employee when he first saw us that we were ready to buy a bow. You would think, in a retail business, we would get prompt and willing service. You would be wrong. He did not want to spend time with us. We waited for a very long time. We even had time to look through the entire store before he finally came to us. When he did come to us his advice was short, rushed, rude and perhaps more importantly, contradictory to most everything I have studied and been taught by the very guy who recommended this store. This employee even went as far as to say he did not have time to work with us because they were busy. There were 2 other people in the store and they were looking around. Regardless, at 10am on a Saturday they should have more employees available. NOT MY FAULT. A prior review advised Archery Headquarters was condescending. Yes. A very true description. Condescending but I also want to emphasize that their condescension is not even warranted because their advice was inaccurate.   My friend and I wanted to leave, regardless of his attitude, when we recognized his inaccurate advice but we are patient and wanted to give hime a chance to win back our business. When he straight-out told us he didn't have time for us, however, we politely thanked him for his time and got the heck out. We went to Lancasterarchery.com, purchased what we already knew we wanted... without tax or shipping costs and moved on with our lives.   We will pay someone else to set up our bows... or maybe just research a little more and do it ourselves. Lancasterarchery.com benefitted with 3 bow sales from me and 1 from my friend. The cold internet service of a "dotcom" was way better than the service at Archery Headquarters.

I have gone here for years and I was very happy. The staff was awesome my dentist was nice and calming. I never had any major troubles except one time I had a superficial cavity which was easily filled.   However, I came in this time and my dentist mysteriously retired (no notice to me) my hygienist retired (she was only in her 30's?) and the receptionist retired (she was a little older but not of retirement age.)   I don't know what happened but this isn't a nail salon. You can't just change out the staff and especially the dentist without warning me.   Then, the new receptionist required me to take a web cam photo? and then fill out a lengthy health questionnaire. Why wasn't this in their records?  I told them no thanks and left before my appointment. I will do some research and make my own decisions on who will work on my teeth.  In summary, I was a fan before but now I've experienced better.

I used this place about 10 years ago. My experience was good so I came back when I purchased my new car. The installation was quick and professional and the product is quality.   *Note: I just purchased a brand new vehicle. At the time it only had about 300 miles on it. After the tinting with "Made in the Shade" I noticed 3 scratches on the exterior of the driver's window. I brought my car back to look at it. The owner said they only work with the inside of the window so those scratches must have been there before they serviced it. Also, they advised I probably did not see the scratches without the tint but now the darkness of the tint made them more noticeable. I cannot verify the truth of these statements but thought it should be noted in case others have similar circumstances.

This location has 2 businesses. A bar and a grill. I never entered the bar. I only eat at the grill for breakfast. I love the food though. This is a great, greasy spoon when you don't care about exotic "gourmet" concoctions an upscale location or an eye catching electronic sign. This place serves your standard menu items. Quality food,  reasonable prices and low overhead. Just the way I like it! The other reviewers commented on the owner and her abrasive nature. I agree she is abrasive but only at first glance. She is funny and sweet if you give her a chance.

Parking is crap. I had to pay for parking. I couldn't find a spot initially because the lot was so full. I sharked for awhile before finally finding a spot. I can't believe I had to pay for this. It isn't like the property is worth so much that they lose money on the lot. Whatever.  Service fee at the box office. What up with that? That is "Bait and Switch" because there is no cheaper way to purchase the tickets. They advertise one price and then you learn there is an unavoidable fee. Bait and switch.    The security line is a joke. You get the full pat down. You need to empty your pockets too. I felt like I was entering some jail at a 3rd world country. I hate being treated like an animal.   They scan your ids and retain the photos. Feel violated much?   Alcohol is expensive. The AC must be broken because it was hot like a mutha. There are virtually no seats in the entire venue; including the bar and the outside area. The only place to sit is a low brick wall outside, in the heat with the smokers.   The theater has no seating as well. The floor is concrete so that is super comfortable for any show over 30 minutes. Nothing like standing for hours on a slanted concrete slab.   The security are jerks. They seem to forget we are the customers paying for their part-time salaries. The Marquee is one of the few businesses that don't want to cater to the customer. I have skipped out on several shows hosted by the Marquee. My decision was strictly based on the venue. I hate that place and hate giving them my hard earned dollar.

Food was awesome, the service was not so much. If I come again and the service lacks I will take off a point.

The outdoor area was beautiful. The indoor as well but the indoor acoustics were so bad I couldn't understand the toasters or the music. The acoustics were bad because there was nothing to absorb the noises. By the tlme everything reached my ear it was a mishmash of echos. The water glasses had floaties like I have never seen before. It was like a an appetizer before the meal. My table was nervously playing with them by swirling them around our glasses like snow globes.

Debi is our current property manager and has been for the last few years. Of all the property managers I have worked with; of most people I have worked with for that matter, Debi stands above them. She is smart, professional, organized, timely and friendly. She makes property management seem easy (and I know it is difficult.)

Sports Exchange has been my go-to sports headquarters for years. The prices are very competitive and the selection is awesome. Also, I recently returned to find the floor space had doubled for even more selection! I have purchased softball, racquetball, and golf equipment as well as weight training equipment and kettlebells. Kevin, the owner, is very knowledgeable and can help with any sport he carries. He takes the time to discuss your needs to provide the best recommendations. Shop here first for a one-stop experience.

I came in to replace my back 2 tires and my spare. Bad news and good news. My front tires could not be balanced because they had bubbles on them. I agreed that they were old and needed replacing. They would not do the work for me without replacing all 4 tires (safety/liability concerns.) The good news was: they worked out an arrangement to lay-away my front two tires, replace all 5 (with the spare) and allow me to drive off on the unpaid front tires. They trusted me to pay them at my convenience without collateral (or financing.) I really appreciated their trust and all parties benefited. I have my new tires and as of this posting, I have returned to pay a hundred dollars toward my balance.

After shopping IKEA we found this nearby hotspot. Come ready for cheesesteak because the menu is very simple. Choose your size, meat, toppings and if you want fries. That's about it. Simple and sweet. The place is clean and the service is enthusiastic. Also, the portions ensure a good value.

I have been going here for years.  This location has its good times and its bad times (depending on management and staff.)  The food is mostly good as far as sports bars go. I love their black and bleu burger!!! Again, depending on staff it is sometimes better than others. The long term servers are excellent! You know right away which will stick around. I totally agree with the service reviews from prior posts but those servers are the short-timers.  This location recently got a facelift, newer tv's and some seating re-orgs. This makes it a little easier to see the TVs but the tv's have never really been easy to see based on the seating arrangements. Still, many tv's means many channels so your team will, likely be playing and I'm sure they will change your TV channel to accomodate your preference.  I'm giving this 4 stars because despite its occasional flaws *servicecough the standard servers are really very good (friendly and accomodating.) The food prices are decent but if you get their specials the prices are awesome!

K, so I am a moron when it comes to health-care. I'm in my 30's now and things are coming up.   So now I need to start getting blood drawn and I need to use my health-care.   I went to 2 Labcorps now. This one and the location on Greenfield and US 60. Both were horrible. I made appointments at both (thank God because the wait time without appointments were about 1 1/2 hours!!!)  Also, I never, ever, in all my experiences with businesses experienced more mean, uncaring and unprofessional staff.   I say incompetent because right off they demanded my insurance information. I gave to them. They took it, photo copied it and then put it in my file. I have a major health-care provider (top 2) but never was I told Labcorp was out of network. Talk about a courtesy! This happened at 2 locations. I did not learn about it until both claims were denied by my insurance (several weeks later.)   Depending on your insurance, Labcorp pretty much has a monopoly and you don't have much choice but I can recommend you avoid this location and the Greenfield and US 60 locations. Yikes!

Alice's Cuisine has been a vendor with my company for several years and hope they never go away. Their menu is diverse, their prices are competitive, and their service (professional, friendly and knowledgeable) is A+. Reliability and timeliness are unmatched. Their flavors are always tasty and range from comfort-food favorites to new and exotic; always fresh ingredients. I cannot wait to see what is on the next menu!

My family and I often go here to play on Jester's quality tables and enjoy their competitive prices and friendly staff.   Jester's has an awesome selection of beers and their partnership with a neighboring Italian restaurant is a genius business model.   I come with my family (women except for me) and enjoy their lady's night special (only I have to pay.) This makes for a cheap and fun family night.   This is not a perfect rating for two reasons:  1) There have been a few occasions when we have shown up ready to play but all the tables are booked for leagues and tournaments. This is a good thing for Jester's but a bad thing for recreational players. I cannot think of a fix except to purchase more square footage and add more tables. Maybe get rid of the plastic tip dart section since I never see people use those.   2) I have witnessed one occurance (but other customers have told me this is common) where the opening shift is late to open the doors for business. I waited and hour for her to arrive and let us in.

Never even called me back to quote me. They warn it can take up to 2 business days but it has been a week. Oh well, I went elsewhere.

The wait can be long I have spoken to other customers, waiting in queue on a Friday night, and we decided we were at fault for spreading the word and increasing their customer-base. Oh well, at least they are making profit.  This place is bomb. I usually go on Friday nights with my friend or my family but I have also enjoyed their cheap, high quality, lunch specials. Their lunches are the best buy in the neighborhood! The service is friendly, the ambiance is surprisingly lush and exotic (especially for a strip-center restaurant) and their sauces. OMG! What separates this Thai from others is their seasonings. My meals vary, Panang Curry is my old faithful but I have also had their peanut sauce dishes. Finally, they have a pretty cool loyalty card so frequent customers get the occasional free meal (Excellent!) After reviewing this place I suddenly have a craving so I know I will be there tonight :)

I've practiced at this facility for about 30 years. It changed names several times but the current owners have kept it up the best. Do not expect anything fancy (only the bare essentials) but you will get batting practice from well maintained machines. Also, you can pay by the hour, which is an incredible convenience!

We came here with a party of 12. We knew to get a reservation in advance but when we arrived they didn't know of the reservation. That was a huge inconvenience. Also, do NOT get the nachos. $15 for a huge mound of chips with just enough toppings to classify as nachos. I posted a photo after eating off the small quantities of toppings. Note the still-full plate of chips.

I went there for team trivia. Otherwise I would not have heard of Tukees. It is a sports bar with plenty of well placed televisions. The seating, however, was very uncomfortable because the seat was hard on my rear and my back. The tables were uncomfortable because they were small and without legroom. This made sitting side by side difficult for my wife and I.  The service was ok. The hostess was very accommodating. Once we sat I waited awhile for the server to take my food order but, otherwise, she was ok.  The food was horrible. My wife and I ordered spinach dip and nachos to share.  The chips were too thin, even for their spinach dip, so they constantly broke. The nachos were very bland and all the ingredients came from a can. It came with mild salsa but I wanted more spice. The only hot sauce available was Tabasco. I don't drink so I cannot rate their drinks. I would go back if the tables were more spacious but I would not eat there again.

This place takes me back to cafe/bakeries before Starbucks drove them all out of business. This is a restraunt where you can have a cup of coffee (real coffee,) a simple breakfast and/or a bakery item in a friendly atmosphere. This is the type of restraunt were the owner knows your name and where the customer's interact with each other and are not too busy to say 'Hi.' The menu is simple but effective. I recommend their breakfast burrito, their biscuits and gravy and any of their bakery items. They have other breakfast items and also a sandwich menu but I have not tried those. Again, don't expect Starbucks but, in my eyes, that is a good thing.   Tables sit 4 but if it isn't crowded you can move them together. probably only about 20 seats in the restraunt (it's small.)  Most menu items are under $5. The sandwiches can be more. Of course, as a bakery, you can also purchase baked goods.  The high quality and low prices make this restaurant a "Best Buy."

I was a big fan of this place. I very much enjoyed their happy-hour food, their unique salsa with chips, their drinks and their live music. That was a then; now, they completely changed. Their happy-hour food-qualities greatly diminished with new recipes and lesser quantities; simultaneously, they increased their prices. Their unique salsa (I know people who would showed up just to buy to-go salsa) was replaced by a very average (almost no good) recipe and the chips are now store-bought quality. Finally I haven't seen any live entertainment for quite some time. My wife and I both feel the same about TQLA and have verbally agreed not to go back after our last few experiences. Adios TQLA.

I have been here about a handful of times. I always get the gyro so I am unable to comment on their other meals. This is a compliment to the Gyro House because their gyros are so good I haven't tired of them. The meat is well seasoned, juicy and plentiful.   I can also comment on their side salad and falafel because I get them to compliment the gyro. The side salad comes as an included option with the gyro meal (along with a drink.) When I'm with others I buy the falafel as an appetizer. The salad is made of the good cuts of lettuce (not the average crappy oversized chunks of iceberg lettuce I get at many other restaurants.) It includes peppers, onion, tomato, cucumber and some kind of homemade oil and herb dressing. Awesome! The falafel is also homemade (not made from a mix like with many of their competitors.) This gives it a unique taste and freshness.  The service is very friendly, professional and accommodating and for all this quality the prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend it.

I had two of their empanadas and my wife and 2 others so I was able to taste 4 of them. They were all awesome! I don't have a favorite. I can see me getting different ones for my different moods but they will be perfect.   We also shared plantain chips. Yum! I haven't had plantain since our honeymoon cruise in the Caribbean and these did not disappoint. Probably better.  They also had some very tasty salsa-verde. Yum!  Note: I was also very impressed with clean, hip atmosphere. The large HD TV's playing "Back to the Future" was an added bonus.

Cantor Nesis is amazing. She was professional. Also, she took time to prepar my fiance and I to prepare for our very special and important wedding ceremony. I heard more compliments about Cantor Nesis than any other aspect of my wedding night.   Highly recommended

I came here because I was leaving a nearby event and my group was hungry. I used by trusty yelp app to find a nearby place with good reviews. For a casual dinner (we were dressed up but this wasn't date night or anthing) this place was overkill but the data on yelp seemed to be a fit. The Yelp data needs correction. This is not a $$ restaurant. This is at lease a $$$. They have several courses for their meals and the owner advised their proteins are flown in fresh so that would also influence the price.   The waitress was very accomodating but the hostess was pretty stuffy (I understand the hostess was replaced so that is a good thing.) I am not frugal. I just do not typically dine at these places because I don't need 4-5 course meals or high-end proteins on average days. After looking over the menu I realized yelp's mistake, paid for my drink and went a few doors down the street.   I understand The 2nd Story Liquor Bar has happy hour and late night drink specials so that helps. I didn't have a perfect experience but what I did experience but I understand some things were corrected since my visit.   I probably would have stayed and enjoyed it if the 2nd Story had some lower cost alternatives on the menu for average nights.

I recommend this place based on the quality of the food and service. 1455 offers juicy burgers, friendly service and an industrial interior design.  The ingredients are definitely high quality. I had a burger, my wife had a tri-tip. We were both pleased. Most the seating is made up of 4-seater booths (in the restaurant section and pub tables in the bar section. We sat at the booths. 1455 has televisions displaying sports but the booths, walls are high and the tvs are situated so that you really need to sit near the bar to comfortably see them any way. There was an outdoor section that overlooked the parking-lot. The prices for some of the food, like our parmesan fries, were a little high for the quantity provided. The wait, for their grand opening, was worth it but I probably won't be able to frequent this place as often (based on the price.) This will be more of a weekend restaurant than a cheaper weekday restaurant.   ****Update**** I have not, yet, been back for another try but I did just get a tip from another yelper.  "They now have a lunch menu that will beat any other prices as well! Check out their Facebook page for the menu. I'm sure you will be pleased with the prices and the food."  So I will check out their lunch menu and see what we see.
