This used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant near downtown now they raised their prices and are charging for bland fried rice for lunch and the soup looks like a bowl of snot! I will not be back!!

Terible costumer service from the manager! I found a set of pots and pans that clearly said it was on sale but the guy was a total jerk and refused to give me the discount.

Probably one of the worst experiences of my life! Keven is a complete condescending jerk!!!! All he did was talk about how he couldn't work with my budget and how my credit isn't great but he might be able to find someone to take me but I drew the line when he started talking crap about my income! I make more in a day the this moron makes in a week and he's talking crap about my income? I would give this place a zero if I could!!

I've encountered some pretty bad karaoke hosts in my life but this dude is lucky to have walked away without an ambulance and ER visit! He disrespected me and my friend so much I will never come back!

I love this vet office!!! I have a little Chihuahua and she is like a child to me so it helps to know that she has doctors and nurses that are there to take care of her when she's not feeling well. Lauren Monte is the sweetest kind person with a heart of gold I feel they could never pay her enough!!! I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good vet for their pet!!!

I'm 90% sure the owner of this burned it down rather than doing the right thing and selling it or closing it and now he isn't giving his employees money that was raised for them to get them through the holidays. This guy is a total sleeze ball!

This is by far the best Dentist office I have ever been too! I live and work downtown and I always pass by the office on my way to work. One day I ate a piece of candy that broke a crown I have off. I don't have dental insurance so I was freaking out! I called one place and they quoted me $1000 to fix it and I was like no way! My boss said I should stop in this office because he had heard good things about them. When I stopped in Robin was SOOOOOO nice!!! She said they could just glue it back on (which I hadn't thought of DUH!!!) for significantly less money. When I came in for my appointment Dr. Berscheler was very professional and nice. I have a lot of anxiety with dental work and I was relieved to find that he actually realizes that there is a person attached to the tooth he is working on! He is so gentle I swear it was the most painless dental appointment I have ever had both financially and physically. Please do yourself a favor and book an appointment with them ASAP!!!!

I love this place! It's right down the street from my apartment so I order to go all the time and everything I've tried is so good! Their pasole is fantastic so is their Bombero burrito. I tried the El Pastor taco today and it was the best I've ever had!

I can't say enough about how helpful the employees of this store are! I have a 4 pound chihuahua who is the pickiest eater on the planet! I've struggled to find food that she will eat as long as I've owned her! She is basically like a toddler that will never grow out of that phase. So after the latest hunger strike because she got tired of the last food I found that she will eat they gave me some samples so I can hopefully find something she will eat!
