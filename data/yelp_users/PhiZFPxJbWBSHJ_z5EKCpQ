I LOVE the Bacado. There is nothing better for nursing a hangover than the Good Egg.   We try to visit every few weeks. Yes, the wait for a table can be long, but it's totally worth it!

Mi Patio is a great place for a quick meal or happy hour with your friends.  Inexpensive, quick, consistent.  You can't go wrong with a meal here.

Copper Star is my go-to coffee joint. Their coffee is great, their iced tea is great, and their sweet treats are great.  The GIANT rice crispy treat is gooey and buttery and delicious - just like it should be.  Nice counter staff & baristas. The owner is super nice too.  Can't beat the location and the price - and the free Wi-Fi.   Also the band that plays on Sunday mornings is AWESOME!

$5 burgers on Mondays?!?! Awesome. They have great pretzel buns! For some reason, we always end up on the patio, which can be a little packed, but that doesn't ruin the experience. The only downside to the place is that service can be a bit slow sometimes, but I generally attribute that to how packed it is and they seem like they need one more server.  Parking sucks here. More often than not, I've had to park across the street by the old gym (and not in the "reserved" spaces, they'll tow your ass!) and jaywalk.  PS If you are into douche-sighting - you're in for a big treat. Ladies with postage stamp miniskirts and dudes with over-gelled hair, spray tans, and Affliction shirts galore!

Stopped in here for a Friday happy hour with co-workers. The beer was decently priced for happy hour. The appetizers were decently priced, which would be awesome if they were good.  The chicken strips were terrible. I have never eaten something so greasy and yet dry all at once. They are beer battered (like fish) which could be good, but the execution on this was terrible. The outside was really greasy which took away all of the crispy goodness that usually happens when things are battered and deep fried. The chicken itself was dry as a bone. We also got an order of fries that came out cold and were just below mediocre.  The place was really warm, which could be attributed to the summer heat, but we were sitting inside, so there is a fair assumption that air conditioning would be involved.  I'll pass next time my coworkers are planning a trip here. I'd be better off eating at McDonald's.

I really liked this place. The iced tea is great and you get free refills!  The decor is cute and inviting and the staff is very friendly. Free WiFi too!

This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Actually, the world. Yes, the neighborhood is crazy by some people's accounts, but I guarantee the food makes up for it! The green chile here is awesome. Best breakfast in town, the Nana's Special rules!  We had our wedding catered by La Canasta. The food was awesome and the service was impeccable! Richard is the best!

My dogs and I love Smelly Dog. The store is so cute! Since the new owner has taken over, they have expanded to twice the size, and they now carry tons of food, toys and accessories for your pooch!  We usually do the self-wash because our doggies are scaredy-cats, but the awesome staff will cut their nails for you if you can't!  You can't beat the price, the environment, or the service!  Smelly Dog gets 5 very big stars from me.

We have eaten at Sylvia's many times over the past few years and there are always two constants...the food is decent and the restaurant is hot as hell.   Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you will usually get a good meal for a good price. All restaurants do have their off days and Sylvia's is no exception, but we have been pleased more often than not.   The things that really irk me about the place is the fact that they charge an additional 75 cents if you want a "to go" cup. I understand that everything costs money, but 75 cents is a little steep. Also, the place is really hot everytime we eat there. In fact, that is one of the biggest reasons we avoid the place. I don't know if their air conditioner has been broken for four years, or if the management is just too dang cheap to keep their customers comfortable.

It's still hot. They now have table service, and it is terrible. It seems like morale is really low at this place. The hosts and waitstaff look like they all can't wait to leave, and that shines thru while they're "helping" you.  If you are looking for great Mexican food, take a trip 8 miles south and go to the Original La Canasta.

Humid.  The edamame was served cold, when we asked for it to be warmed, it still came back cool. The rolls tasted ok, but they were rolled so loosely that they fell apart.    I was really bummed to have such a bad experience. I will go back again to give them another chance.

I have been back a few more times since I last reviewed Switch. I will say that the service has definitely improved! Also, try the drunken Italian sodas. They're great.   I think it is a great place to go if you are looking to have drinks.

Awesome value. In fact, we got so much food  we couldn't even eat it all. I think we're going to have to go in with friends on the next basket so our produce doesn't rot in the fridge.  Fresh and delicious, I couldn't ask for more!!

The big ass storm last night knocked our power out, and 18 hours later it is still out, so while taking refuge in a friend's AC, my spouse and I popped in for a late lunch.   We both ordered the 1/3 lb International Burger (I guess 1000 island dressing makes it international) and fries with a large Coke. Not too bad to get all of that food for about $12.  The burgers are charbroiled, not fried, which is good. You can only eat so many fried burgers.   The fries were just ok which knocked off one star, but I'm definitely going to go back and try them again (fries can be hit-or-miss).  Overall, very satisfied. Taste, quantity, price all good!

The ambiance is super cute, but unfortunately that doesn't make up for the bad sushi.   I mean, a conveyor belt is super fun, but raw fish riding around the restaurant without any refrigeration is a scary notion.   I am not a fish person, so I stick to shrimp and krab/crab (yes, I know krab is pressed fish.. ) and didn't try any of the fish rolls, but everyone else at the table mentioned that their rolls were all fishy.  Fishy fish is a sign that it isn't very fresh.  A lot of people complained about the service...I didn't think it was particularly bad. You would get the same type of service at any other buffet-type restaurant.  It is cheap, but so is Taco Bell.   I wanted to like this place because my friend was so excited to go there for his birthday, but I really didn't.

The best. Hands down.   Found the place by accident. The strip mall is crazy but the food is AMAZING! You'll never waste your time looking for a great Italian place ever again!

Yuck. The chicken in my tacos was dry and tasteless. The lemonade was pricey and tasted like Countrytime powder. The people that were eating here apparently thought they were awesome, and I was not, so they gave me the stinkeye the entire time I was there.  Came here on a friend's suggestion. Was definitely not impressed. Bad food, bad clientele...not coming back ever again.

We popped in on a Monday night. There were only three or four other people in the bar. The drinks were good, but a little pricey.  Unfortunately, the air conditioner was on the fritz that night, so it was hot as hell in the bar. However, the owner/manager was so sweet and apologized and sat and talked with us for a while.  The decor is welcoming. I spent several minutes zoned out staring at the color changing art on the wall.  I will definitely be back on a night that is busier to check it out again!

Yum.   My spouse and I got 3 tacos each (don't judge, they're small!) a side of rice, a side of beans, and 2 sodas for about $12!  The place is tiny and a bit on the warm side, but the food more than makes up for it. I had the carne asada tacos and they were amazing. Very simple - 2 small corn tortillas, carne asada, onions, and cilantro, and delicious!  We got 3 types of salsas, one red, one green, and one cilantro saucy good thing. They each had the perfect amount of flavor and heat.   Our meals also came with a nice little side of grilled onions and jalapenos. They were amazing. The onions were perfectly sweet and the jalapenos had crispy, salty skin.  We will definitely be back again next time we are in the area.

I made a mistake by booking a rental with Fox on Orbitz. Well, I made 2 mistakes. The first was booking with Fox, the second was for not double checking the date I scheduled it for (which happened to be in 3 weeks, not sure how that happened).   I understand that I made the mistake in the first place, but the events that followed prompted me to make sure that I tell everyone I know to avoid Fox.  Since we were planning a drive to San Diego, we arrived at pickup at 5am. There was no counter agent (as expected that early) so I headed down to the garage for pickup...but there was no one there either. I had to wait ten minutes for the grubby lot attendant to "help" me. After we were told that the reservation was made for the wrong date and there was nothing he could do about it, he told me to "call Orbitz" and change the reservation. I cancelled my original reservation and attempted to make a new one, but by then they were out of cars (which they weren't because said lot attendant said they had plenty).  I tried calling their 24 hour customer service number and they did not pick up. I went back down after finally being able to make a reservation online and then they said that it takes 2 hours to populate in the system.  Had to cancel that reservation. By now, it is 6 am  and the counter agents still hadn't arrived, but I was able to get thru and make a reservation on their reservation line.   Then, back downstairs to pick up the car since it was now 6:20 and the Fox employees still hadn't shown up for work. The lot attendant then told me that he could do nothing for me since it was after 6, and the counter agents were now on duty.   Except they weren't. They were gabbing in the garage.  I go back upstairs. Only to find out that all car rental companies have changed their policy to: if you don't have a credit card you're screwed.   I guess people steal their cars all of the time, so the standard $250 deposit they usually take from my debit card wasn't enough.   ...and the worst of it? They were going to do a credit check. Like I want a point taken off of my credit score to rent a car. So I left and thought it would be better to chance a trip across the desert in my 15 year old Buick.  We made it and had a blast.  To sum it up, yeah, I made a mistake, but Fox's customer service is absolutely horrible. If you are in a rush or don't want to have a credit card, AVOID FOX AT ALL COSTS.
