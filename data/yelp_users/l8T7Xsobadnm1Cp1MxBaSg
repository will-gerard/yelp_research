This place is truly a "compound," with multiple buildings of hotel room suites, 6 pools, a few restaurants, and an entire waterpark.  It takes a lot of walking to get around, but if you can find your way back to the main lobby, they will shuttle or golf cart you wherever you'd like to go.  The staff is friendly  and they have big baskets of lollipops in the lobby, which was cute.  My suite was bigger than some apartments I've lived in for years.  It was clean, quiet, and nicely appointed.  It did smell of smoke, but didn't keep me from sleeping soundly or enjoying my time there.  My work pals tell me that local families stay here sometimes just to use the waterpark.  Sounds like fun to me!

It's always interesting to visit places where real estate isn't at such a premium... you get bigger hotel rooms and enormous one-story malls.  This is one of the latter.    Some of the stores are true outlets, but others are just their regular selves without any noticeable discounts.  I did find some good deals and got quite a workout trying to hit most of the shops in the 2 hours I had there.   Plus one star:  I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the bathrooms and the availability of maps.    Minus one star: I didn't like how it was hard to get from one side to the other -- there should be more places to cross through.

Ridiculously cute clothes, a good sale, a friendly cashier, and some truly outlet-priced items.  I had to make myself STOP and get out of there before I got too many teeny outfits.  It would've been sooooo easy to go hog-wild here.    And this is what I've become -- hog wild at a kids' clothing store?   (shakes head and mutters)

Huge store, great selection for the whole family.  Prices were really good and they had a nice sale in progress.  I didn't get anything, but there were plenty of sizes available and the staff was friendly but not pushy.

I was realllly tempted to get a hot little nurse's uniform (for Halloween, of course!), but I resisted temptation.  Looks like they had a good selection, though.

They had some OK clothes here and a few bargains, but terrible customer service.  Someone totally cut me in line and the cashier didn't do a thing about it.  I walked out without making a purchase.

"Customer service" interpreted by teen-aged mall employees = apathetic and barely a transaction.    "Coffee" interpreted by Paradise = barely a step up from awful.  Why does this enormous mall not have decent coffee in more findable/convenient locations?  Nobody should have to beg for swill from reluctant youths.

I went to a group thing here and had a better time than I thought I would.  Service at the bar was good, and there was a nice drawing-room style chill out room if you wanted to get away from the kiddie casino vibe of the rest of the place.  I also liked the row of old skool games for geezers like me that haven't played since we were kids -- Centipede, Pac Man, Frogger, Mario Bros, etc.  I never made it down to the skee ball area, but you know I would've taken the local kids OUT.

I love an airport that feels like a casino.  If they had free cocktails and waitresses in little skirts, I'd give 'em the full five stars.  There is good people watching here if you run outta quarters.

I don't know why you'd come here without kids, unless you were just in town for a short period of time and trying to combine shopping and dinner with an old friend before you head back to the airport.    If you had kids, this would probably be great -- there's plenty to distract them -- animatronic animals and booming thunderstorms and drinks served in blinky rocket glasses.  You could probably even finish your overpriced meal and knock back a drink or two before the critters started actiing up.  You could even purchase a toy at the gift shop on the way in and hope to finish a dessert.  This will only cost you an arm and a leg, standard amusement park pricing.  If you're just 2 ladeez trying to catch up, this is probably not your venue.  There are kids and families all around -- happily, their ruckus won't be too annoying because all you can hear are jungle sounds and thunderstorms.  For a "save the animals" themed place, there sure was a lot of meat on the menu.  The only veggie options were cheez sticks or a veggie burger.  I guess I could've gotten the shrimp pasta sans shrimp, but I balked at the $17 price tag.  I did like sitting next to the enormous fish tank and having them peer at the progress of my dinner.  I was just glad I wasn't eating one of their pals.  I don't think I could've handled the bug-eyed gaping.

Great ambience!  I especially like that they hire someone to deliver fresh-baked bread via bicycle along the cobblestone "streets" --  I want that job!  Yummy pastries at the boulangerie, but there can be a line.

Really pretty casino and nice place to hang out.  We spent a lot of time in the food court, even if we were staying somewhere else.  They have a good sandwich place that makes a fresh panini and a ginormous gelato stand with about 40 different kinds of frozen goodness.  We also ate at the Asian fusion restaurant that was upstairs.  There was a lot of sake involved, but I think I recall the food as being tasty.  The gondola rides seem a bit like getting paddled around a mall, but it could be fun, I guess.

I haven't been to "TI" (sigh) since they've gotten rid of the pirates, but it used to be a pretty hip casino with full-strength free cocktails and a lovely skull decor.  I'll post an update the next time I get a chance to check it out.

It's cheap, they usually have rooms, and they have $1 Blackjack!  It's not new or fancy (although they did recently renovate the rooms), and it's up at the end of the strip near the Stratosphere, but it's a good home base for your wild Vegas stay.  Spend the money you'll save on gambling instead.

It's a lounge, baby!  This is old swanky Vegas at its trashy best, complete with indoor fireplace.  You must go and have a cocktail.  Heck, stay for dinner.  Or do as this website sez and have a nice makeout session:  http://www.vegas.com/nightlife/bars/peppermill.html.

I didn't stay here, but hung out in a friend's suite, which was pretty nice.  Another friend won big at the slots, so that was good too.  The pool is super neato, and the location can't be beat.  We went to the house burlesque show and found it to be ridiculous and highly entertaining.  http://www.hilton.com/en/hi/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=LASFLGV

OK, so I'm a sucker for the Old Vegas style.  The New Frontier has great room specials and sometimes you can get a HUGE suite for the same price as a room somewhere else.  (I'm serious -- it was bigger than my apartment in SF!)  They have $1 frozen margaritas downstairs and the biggest country bar in Vegas, complete with two-steppin' cowboys and their ladies.  It's hard to find food after midnight, but that's not why you're there...  http://www.frontierlv.com/

I've only been here for breakfast/brunch and lunch, but it was an "egg"cellent experience every time.  Big portions, really friendly service, casual homey atmosphere.  They did a great job accommodating our large group (we called ahead to warn them we were on the way). It's a nice spot  to get away from The Strip and have some comfort food.  http://www.eggandi.com/

3.5 stars, but I'll round up.  For airport food, this was a great find.  There were a number of vegetarian options, a place to sit down, and OK margaritas.  I had 2, and they each came out quite differently -- not sure why.  The lady next to me had an issue with her salad and they took care of it right away and checked in to make sure that the replacement was working.  I'd go back.  I'd like to see the food be a little spicier, but it was nicely flavored other than that.
