I dropped off my dress feeling good, thinking it was in good hands.  But when I went to pick it up (two weeks before my wedding), she hadn't even worked on it.  She completely forgot!  It was a detailed alteration and it was supposed to happen in two stages.  And she knew my wedding was fast approaching, I even saw her mark the appointments and deadlines on her calendar.  When I showed up, she was in the middle of another appointment and did not seem to know that we even had an appointment.  So now, I have to scramble to try and find an alternative.  She had my dress for a long time and I could have left it with someone else, but instead it was sitting at her place not being worked on at all.  I would not trust her to meet a deadline.  Not sure how well she sews as I just left with my dress and requested my money back.  Would not recommend.

Very delicious pulled chicken tacos. The rice was undercooked, but the tacos are so good. It's my new fave taco place.
