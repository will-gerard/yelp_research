LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.   What a great place this is! I mean wine and bruschetta? You can't get better then that!     On Mondays Tuesdays they have a bottle of house wine and a bruschetta for $20!! What a steal! The only down side those days WILL be busy but it's totally worth the wait! (And you can start drinking your wine while you wait. They have little tables you can stand around or sometimes areas you can sit!)The outside patio at night is to die for! But it can be a bit noisy!   Wonderful "girl night" get together spot!

Hands down the best BYOB and restaurant in Scottsdale! I have never had a bad experience here! Todd does a wonderful job here and the service is always spot on!   This is an amazing place for every occasion! I had my wedding reception here and I couldn't of asked for a better night! My Guests still talk about my wedding night, and how good the food was. This is a place everyone should try, it really is exceptional. Any duck menu item is always one of my favorites!  I can't say enough positive things about this place!

Wow. What an experience this restaurant is! I'm so happy I finally tried it! My husband and I took his mother out for her birthday and all got the 4 corse tasting menu and I was so full! Haha! I never though a ton of little dishes would fill me up but I was wrong!  This is one for the books! I would highly recommend it! Such creative little dishes will blow your mind! A great anniversary spot, date, or a romantic dinner! Make sure you look nice and make a reservation!  The service was wonderful and I am very excited to go again!

This is the best salon in Phoenix, hands down. I have been coming here for at least two years and I will never leave. Forest does an amazing job and my hair always looks and feels wonderful! I get complements on it all the time. She also did my wedding hair!! Everyone here is so nice and they really make you feel welcomed. The new location is top notch, clean, bright and very functional! (It looks functional to me at least being a customer lol! )  the staff is also very knowledgable about products, so if you looking for something specific ask! They will point you in the right direction! I really can't say enough positive things about this salon! Seriously get your hair done here! You will not be disappointed!   (I drive 45 mins to get here and I would drive even further!)

I adore the concept of this restaurant!   I have been here twice now and I am hooked! Both times I have gotten the 5 corse and it was awesome! I love the "menu" and just being able to cross off what you won't eat. The element of surprise here is what really makes this place fun. I have never been disappointed here, the food really is wonderful! If you are willing to be adventurous and try new things, this is the place for you!   The service is always great and the atmosphere is awesome! Make sure you look nice! This would be a cool place for a first date or a birthday dinner!

My favorite Italian restaurant!   Each time I come here I become more and more impressed! Franco is so wonderful and inviting! The food is so wonderful! Fresh, full of flavor and just delicious. I would recommend everyone trying this gem!   The service is awesome, very attentive and friendly staff! They always have wonderful suggestions if you can decide what wonderful entree to pick! Lovely atmosphere as well! I can't say anything negative about this place!

Meh.   The place is cute I'm sure I could have a better experience but I'm not going to go back. The waiter forgot my wine refill, so I had to ask twice. Then my friends ordered the bruschetta that was very small and not worth the $12. I had ordered a grilled cheese and the waiter forgot that as well. He offered to bring it for me and I declined. I would have been more understanding if the place was busy but it was pretty much empty. So needless to say don't waste your time.
