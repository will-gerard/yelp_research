Not only the slowest Starbucks, but they were out of every food item I asked for. Horrible when you're sent on an office run and you don't know the alternatives your coworkers will like. Usually Starbucks will do SOMETHING to make up for lack of an item. Never going to this one again. This one also doesn't have a drive through so you may as well go to the one in Target across the street

I'm not usually one to write a bad review, but the only positive thing about this place is that they got me in fast. My nails look like a 5 year old did them. No cleanliness is applied here. The technician cut my finger and it was bleeding and then proceeded to brush it off with a brush I'm sure she uses on everybody, spreading the blood everywhere. Paid $25 for a gel manicure but that's pretty much all I got. There was no care taken, no massage, nothing. I still tipped decent but not near what I would normally pay. Should've just gone somewhere closer to home. Still bleeding FYI..

Woah. This place is fire! Starting with their salsa actually having flavor and spice, to their friendliness, to their enchilada sauce! First time eating in casa grande and I will definitely be back! I am usually not a fan of enchilada sauce, but they use the owner's mom's recipe, and it is honestly the best I have ever tasted in my life! And to top it off, their service was phenomenal and some of the nicest people. Can't wait to have another trip down here!

Holy moly Philly cheesesteak!! I have never felt so excited and happy to be at a restaurant. Cindy was one of the best servers I've had. First time here and definitely won't be my last!!

Wow! Definitely the best salon in the area. Just recently moved to cave creek and I've been looking for a place to do my eyebrows. I am very particular about them and it takes a lot to trust just anyone with them. I walked in thinking I was just going to make an appt for a later date, but needed them done today, and Niki was at the front and told me she had a cancellation and took me right in! Not only did a better job than my previous aesthetician, but was probably one of the coolest people I've met. Definitely coming back to see her!!

This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant around us. The service is top shelf, just like their delicious margs. The food never disappoints. Seriously every time I try something new, it becomes my favorite thing to get. The staff treats you like family, and it is always a pleasant experience every time we go

This was an awesome salon!! Went in because of a Groupon deal for nails and now I think I will try it out when I get my hair done. Leah was the sweetest and did a fantastic job on my nails. The whole staff seemed really nice and welcoming. At first they couldn't fit me in for an appt but asked for my number and called me back soon after and got me in! Beautiful salon and extremely clean. I can't wait to try everything else out!!
