I love this place! By far the best sushi in town! Best noodle bowl too! Check it out!

For an establishment as highly ranked as the W Scottsdale, I was very disappointed with the food at the pool and the breakfast both served from the Sushi Roku kitchen.  The food was unpalatable, over garnished with lettuce, and sub par for a restaurant anywhere.  When I returned my food I was told that they know that the "huevo ranchero is bad, but you know how proud chefs are of their food..." Huh! Interesting...

Sri- I've been coming to Sri at beautif-eye for a couple of years now.  She has worked with me getting my eyebrows where I want them. Listens to what I want and remembers my special quirks and details. I'm very specific in who I let work on my face... She is the best! My eyebrows love her!  Ask for her!!!

Had cocktails and apps here a few nights ago. Loved the menu everything we had was well prepared and delicious.  The cocktails were unique and the bartenders were great.  Will definitely be a regular here and bring all my friends to check it out.  Well done to the Chef!
