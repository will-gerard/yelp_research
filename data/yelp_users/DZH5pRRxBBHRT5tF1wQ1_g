Love this place! They've got great food and ambience - just a perfect place to sit outside, grab one of their honey lattes, and anything to nosh on. Love the Tammie Coe offerings! Favorite salad here, their Nicoise. Favorite sandwich, their Croque Madame. Favorite breakfast, their Birchemuesli. Also love the little knick-knacks they've got goin' on everywhere, just adds to the funness. Pet peeve - ocassionally coffee is not consistent, does get ridiculously crowded - and parking's a real hassle. But if you're in walking distance, then you're all set!

Awesome food. I've gone here on several occasions so I've tried a variety of dishes. The sides are great. I've had their bulgogi, bibimbap, a hot soup (can't remember the name), and a cold noodle dish (it was spicy and sweet) - all were delicious. Service is slow, but the boys are polite - the ladies can be a bit frustrated with you - once my family and I asked for wooden chopsticks, we hate the metal ones, and the waitress seemed annoyed. But honestly, the service doesn't bother me - not when the food is this good!

Had to go out of town and looked for many different places to "board" my dog - he's about the size of a Corgi so he didn't need a lot of space, but I definitely preferred to not keep him in a cage. Petsmart's Petshotel is the only place I found with incredibly reasonable prices for the type of boarding spaces they offered. We got him a large room with a regular glass door - not a cage/crate - that had a cot and a television! We also booked a couple of doggie play dates as well as a frozen treat. We were also able to call up and check on him to make sure he was doing okay.  At the end of his stay, when we picked him up, we got a report card detailing everything he did, including the dogs he played with, how he ate, etc. I loved this! It was just the kind of attention to detail I was looking for. Best of all, I felt good that everyone that worked there seemed to exude a love for animals - it may be crazy for me to assume, but if you want to work with animals, I hope you love animals, and know patience, understanding and compassion.  I know that based off this experience, I would definitely keep them on the top of my list for boarding. And I think it's well worthit getting the bigger space with cot and tv - I know it may seem excessive, but I just never felt comfortable with putting my animals behind "bars." And Petsmart makes this very affordable.

I am a nice person, and I prefer writing good reviews, and rarely want to leave something negative. But I gotta say, I've been here twice - with a good enough span of time in between both times, and I've been disappointed twice now. Actually, I attempted a third time in between the two different instances and was turned away - never have I been turned away by a small business. This was close to closing time, but still before, and though normally I would not want to keep people, I figured a small business such as JP Pancake could use the patronage.  At any rate - the last time I went, I ordered french toast - and what I got, I could have made better myself at home. Two tiny, flat pieces of toast, with hardly any flavor and forget presentation. Service was poor as the people waiting and cooking were unattentive and slow - not just to us but in terms of cleaning the tables of patrons who had already left. We walked in and it was litterally, find a table that wasn't strewn with dirty plates and glasses. It was not a pleasant site. And, just as we had been turned away the previous time we had attempted to visit this establishment, we watched them turn away an elderly man about 15 minutes to close.  It was just a bummer - I'm not sure who enjoys this place when literally right down the street is a fantastic breakfast place over and Hayden and Via de Ventura.  To break it down, I would not visit them again. They were: - rude - unattentive - slow - messy/dirty - poor tasting food - poor presentation

My fave grocery store! They have a great selection of produce at amazing prices. I mostly take a trip to Sprouts when I am in need of fruits, veggies, and chicken breast. They do have a great selection of other products as well, including sprouted breads - my favorite being the Alvarado Bakery Flax bread. They also have great prices on bulk items and their nuts, like raw almonds, are frequently on sale. They aren't as bountiful in their selection of meats/deli meats - such as grass-fed beef - as some other stores may be, but I don't doubt this will change as more shoppers visit and the demand is higher.  Overall, Sprouts is always my first choice for groceries!

Yum! I visited this place after hiking Camelback one morning, and it was just what I needed.   It's a relatively busy place, especially on a weekend morning, so even though it's been around for a while, I hadn't decided to check it out until recently. And I'm glad I did. Definitely expect to wait, but if you've got good company, you can hang out in their waiting area - the coffee bar - and get yourself some drinks to start with and just chit chat.  The atmosphere is lively but relaxing; easy to zone out and be in your own little universe. My friend and I ordered two different dishes we were interested in trying and split them - a challah french toast dish and an eggs benedict dish. Both were amazing! We were not disappointed. Though probably not my most favorite french toast in all my life time (I love challah french toast, only way to go), it was quite memorable and something that would encourage me to return so that I can try some of their other items; though knowing me I always seem to go back to what is tried and true.  Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed. Service was fast and friendly, so even though you'll most likely have to wait for a table, it's worth it.

Okay - I went here with the mum and sis. We're not the bar or old town scottsdale types (well, maybe mum was back in her hayday, but the sis and I - we stay away). Really wanted to try this place out and it was fab. Had the Stetson salad, that was cuh-razy good - my sis had some burger she said was "okay," and mum had their mushroom thing (there's only one on the menu, lol) - and that was awesome too. Service was slow, but courteous - they were packed and we did sit at the bar cause we just walked in, no reservations. Atmosphere is "eh" - bunch of people who think they're superstahs but they're not, lol so it's a bit overbearing - but worth braving at least once.

You know what, I like it. It's good, it's fun - the flavors are interesting. My favorite thing is their Soynamis though! Delicious! And so many different ways you can make it. Ambience is okay - the way I see it is I can be surrounded by snooty vegans or snooty carnivores at some fancy schmancy restaurant - either way, the two extremes seem to have the same sort of "air" about them. So I'm not so crazy about who I'm sharing my meal with, but if the meal is good, I am down with it. Service ain't to shabby - not the best, they seem ocassionally bothered that they have to take your order or that you're not entirely sure what you want, but when you give a person a multitude of ways to make things, you're gonna ask, is this gluten-free, is this dairy-free, etc. You'd think they'd be use to those questions by now. But overall, a definite must-try for the adventurous, and staple to my list of faves.

Awesome - love breakfast and this place is great. Love their Apple Pancake, but usually I order omelettes or just regular pancakes. They're omelettes are very fluffy and generous, and come with great sides. Pancakes are super fluffy too. I also really like the atmosphere, it's just a very homey, breakfast place - comfortable, not over done but not a hole in the wall either. It's always packed, so expect a wait for a table.

Hello awesome! Love this restaurant - their dim sum is delicioussss! They've got great selections, and I love being able to head over to their bakery area and snag a couple bun things to go. Service is not so great - but seriously - what do you expect, it's really not unusual for this sort of setup. I would give it 5 stars except that I hate their char-siapao - the bbq bun - this is one of my faves, since I was a little kid and theirs taste blech. I go here often, and stuff my face - awesome food for an awesome price.

I don't know what you'd call this place - fusion Indian food? Definitely a westernized take on Indian food. The only upside being that they really seem to cater to vegans, vegetarians and gluten-free diners. But the food was just not a good representation of what vegans, vegetarians or even Indians, eat! Terribly bland. I had the mango salad - which had NO mangoes in it. I am pretty sure it should have been called Pseudo Mango salad. If I order something called Mango Salad, I fully expect some nice juicy chunks of the fruit. The boyfriend ordered a Chicken Tikka wrap - supposedly wrapped in naan. Seemed more like a regular tortilla. I had a bite, the flavor was okay. I much prefer the nann wraps at Tandoori Times - they are, for one, definitely wrapped in naan, and two, exploding with flavor - and at the same price.  The ambiance was okay, a modern sort of cafe. The service was no good. Really slow, and I wouldn't say particularly friendly. This was the first and last time we'll ever go.

Super yummy! My mom and I went to Noca during restaurant week, this gave us the opportunity to try an appetizer, entree and dessert - and of course share our choices with each other. Everything was amazing! I had the mussels and loved that. Dessert was the best, I've got a big suite tooth - and I had ordered some passionfruit coconut thing and my mom had the strawberry something or other. Names escape me - but the taste and textures were incredibly memorable! And of course I was excited to have gotten a big fluffy ball of blue raspberry cotton candy!  They were quite busy but the staff was incredibly cordial and attentive. We were promptly greeted with the door opened to us, seated immediately (we had a reservation). The space is intimate and a touch raucous but the atmosphere was fun, and made you feel like you were in a "real" city. Love and definitely recommend this restaurant - can't wait to go again!

So good! We had two different sweet crepes, both were excellent! Our crepes were accompanied by coffee, which was also pretty amazing. The cafe is very charming and comfortable, we definitely had a good time getting dessert here. Pretty much the only french food the boyfriend eats are crepes, lol. I'd love to come back and try their savoury crepe selections as well as a sandwich or two as their menu offerings all look quite tasty. I'm sure once I return I will end up giving them 5 stars! Service was awesome as well.

Well, I gotta say, pretty amazing! The decor of the restaurant is modern and chic, but very inviting. The views of the AZ mountains, really help set the mood. Service was fast and friendly, and definitely what I would expect of a restaurant of this caliber.  The food, was exceptional! We had the Tuna Tartare for appetizer, and I normally don't like to order tartare - but this was fabulous. I loved the spicy oil drizzle on the plate - I can't remember, but it might have been a truffle oil. And for dinner I had ordered the Crab Stuffed Shrimp and my friend ordered the Scallops and Mushrooms. Both were amazing and I would order again in a heartbeat.  Definitely a fan, definitely a must-try for those looking for something new and fun, and palette-pleasing. And yes, it's pricey, but worth it - make a date night out of it and catch a movie, it'll be a fun and classy night!

Great breakfast place! It's actually right down the street from where I live, so I can walk there, fill up, and then walk off everything I just ate! It's conveniently located on Hayden in the Greenbelt area, so there are lots of bike paths and wide sidewalks for families - and right near the lakes too, so you can make a great weekend morning out of going here.  Butters is part of Butterfields, so if you're familiar with their menu and service, you'll probably see the similarities. Butters does have a different sort of ambience - a bit more modern, rather than down home and cozy like Butterfields. But equally clean, with fast and friendly service and most importantly the food and presentation is fabulous. I always go for their egg white omlettes, always fluffy and healthy and lots of different side options. One of my faves though is their french toast - if I wanna indulge in something delicious, a feast for my eyes and stomach, I definitely go for their french toast.  Gotta give it a try - there's no other breakfast place I'd go to - except their sister restaurant Butterfields!  EDIT: 8/22/2014  Upped it to 5 stars because I've been here enough times as well as other breakfast places to say that this is definitely my fave. Fast service, consistent food, always delicious, friendly, and I could go on.

I was looking for a photographer to just do a fun and quick session of me and my daughter. She's growing so fast, and I had some photos of us done when she was 8 months and thought it would be nice to get some done now that she's 2.5. I contacted Jacqueline through her website and she responded quickly and even had a date/time and place suggested. She kinda pulled it together faster then I expected, and I was grateful she made it so easy and convenient. I'm terrible in front of a camera, but my daughter is pretty good and she managed us both with ease, lol! Definitely professional. And in only 30 minutes she captured so many beautiful photos, it was difficult to narrow down my favorites. I highly recommend Jacqueline. Professional, timely, and so easy to work with.

Really liked this place! Can't wait to go again. We went for happy hour, and was excited to see that it was family friendly as I have an 8mo old. Other families were in there too. Very relaxed and hip sort of atmosphere. HH items were great! Had the dump truck salad and brussel sprouts and was quite full after my meal. The brussel sprouts were suprisingly rich too - in a good way.:D

Went for restaurant week and was impressed. I had the beef carpaccio with kimchi slaw, the shrimp and pasta, and their peanut butter tres leches for dessert.  I normally don't eat beef, let alone eat it raw, but the carpaccio was really good! The spicy, tangy asian flavors were refreshing. Not too spicy. Loved the wasabi horseradish. The pasta was delicious! I don't usually like pasta because of how heavy it usually is and how I feel after eating it; I finished the whole bowl and was pleasantly full, no doubt, but did not feel weighed down. The flavors were light, despite seeming like a creamy sauce. There was some kind of bread served with the pasta that I loved the texture of.  The tres leches was good. I don't feel like it had the texture I was hoping for - the cake seemed very dense, and I was hoping it would seem more soaked. It was a moist cake, just not what I expected for something that was described tres leches. Did enjoy the peanut butter flavor, but liked their Pear Sorbet better (my mom had that).  Definitely will go again!
