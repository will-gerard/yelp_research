I went here with my male friend to take care of his really cracked and dry feet and relax myself while getting new polish. They were very respectful and did a wonderful job with his dry feet and I know they've seen males before as well.  NICE PLACE I really appreciate the thoroughness of the pedicures here. I choose this place because it has fair prices and lots of options to soften your feet like callus remover, paraffin dip and sugar scrub.   MENU ERROR Although, on their menu in salon and on the website it lists a "sugar glow scrub" for #3 and above, it's like sugar gel high end spas use, but the techs had never heard of it. #3 is one option, callus remover or paraffin dip, #4 is two option, callus, paraffin or citrus sugar scrub, and so on. You have to specify or they default to callus remover.   MASSAGE The massage was nice, not that deep tissue or hard though and didn't pay much attention to the heels, fortunately it was quite long. Massage chair was really nice too, the auto function is short so use the kneading function. *thumbs up* : )  POLISH They mostly have OPI, some China Glaze and Gel colors. They have a lot of unique colors like glitter and crackle but I was surprised they didn't have too many pinks in the OPI.   STAFF Staff didn't say anything to me other than the techs. They were very descriptive on the phone and even made/keep appointments. Walk-ins welcome as well.

Back at it again... with the white tipsss! Just kidding. Getting a pedicure for him and her. Slight quam/correction about the menu. Also during non peak days they're lacking in full staff so they'll be no one there, which I find quite calming... but you may wait awhile to be seen.

First things first, I totally get why the wait times are so long. I waited 50min to go into the room, another 10 for the nurse. They really sit with you and ask you to tell your whole story in your own words, which is good! The check in lady was really nice and patient with me. The nurse practitioner was working with me when I struggled to find my words and I totally thought she was a doctor. I'm not sure if they can do much for me because my brain scans are showing normal but they did help explain my symptoms.   After I saw the doctor I felt really at ease, he came highly recommended and normally I'm very skeptical about doctors and the medical field in general. However they really wanted to hear my case and asked if I preferred medication or a scan or what. My case is kind of an anomaly so I chose no meds. He also insured me I could still drive legally as that was  major concern.

Amazing service! Most of the staff and the owner are always friendly and remember me, they're pretty talkative, not really my thing, but I can deal with it. Only exception is one of the older receptionist girls always seems to be in a foul mood, esp towards me. I use my time there to relax. I get a Shampoo and Style for around $55, the price has been changed on me 4x, 1 high, lowered, 1 higher, 1 higher again. Always around $50 - $65 at one point I believe. I'm told my hair is very easy to work with and it takes about 45min but the receptionist insists on charging me more than the average quote.   I've always gotten a brow wax here, was very good, good shaping and didn't hurt. They're got some nice products and a great boutique, it's for older women with a lot of time and money to spend, their sizes are also slightly above average, a bit larger, the shoes are for small feet... I find it ridiculous over priced but ::NELLY:: is the best stylist ever! She can work with short, long, damaged, healthy, curly, wavy, straight... Black, White, Hispanic, Asian...whatever hair! She's very helpful with you maintaining your own hair and suggesting services or products that actually with work for you! She does amazing color and cutting as well. She's a very creative stylists with a lot of techniques (hair, nails, brow) under her belt, throw anything at her for wedding, prom, date night - she loves it!  * * * Nelly no longer works here, think there was price increases/pay uses. * * *

I went during the day in the middle of the week and ate outside, was pretty slow so I was really surprised it took over 30min to get food. I got the fish and chips which I don't really like fish that much but I like cod, catfish and salmon if it's fried and fresh. The fish tasted... old, it was soft and blubbery. However I should say the best fish I've had has been from the bay in Cali. I've even had box fish that tasted better.  They were sweet and kind enough to give me chicken instead, but the chicken was soft and it tasted like they fried it in the fish oil, even the next day at home it tasted fishy, I wanted to like it, but I couldn't.  Although I will add my friend thinks this place is the greatest, but he's always drunk when he's there, so there's that.

The owner and manager are absolutely obnoxious. The owner has private little parties in the pool area (very annoying because guests can't really gather there or would get yelled at) and the manager seems to have no idea what he's doing.  The rate range from really cheap per what app/site you go through to insanely pricey especially for that area. They have so many different rates depending on it's remodel status and specials and just because it seems. Most guests actually kind of live there which is apparently illegal because at one moment there were these people monitoring the out of state license plates.  The rooms they show on the site / for review are the nicest because they're very artsy, however most of the rooms aren't very nice, old school kitchens and appliances, they think they're being charming - they're not. There's only a couple employees and like one maid? Way too much for a few staff to handle. Sometimes drunks come through in that Scottsdale area so there can be a lot of noise or none at all as it is tucked away.  The grounds have trees with rotting fruit that attracts flies, bugs and I think I overheard "roaches" (didn't see any, but gross!), they don't clean up enough which I don't blame because they don't seem organized. NOT a resort, NOT a bed and breakfast, just an overpriced, over glorified crash pad.

I LOVE THIS BRAKE MASTERS! Paul and Khaled are amazing!   I've been to a lot of mechanics, lived several different places with different cars and I've been jerked around before, but not by Paul and Khaled! Best mechanics I've ever seen, they'll give you the straight facts on what you need and how much it is, plus they'll always try to save you money and get the fairest price for service/parts possible.   I've taken cars in to look at to buy various times of the day, during the week and weekend late afternoon usually and they wait is never more than 40min for them to be done with a full diagnosis.   They will also actually talk to you like a real individual with all the correct terms and show you on the car what they mean, despite myself being a petite lady. My whole family trusts them and I'm pretty ashamed I haven't written a review yet because it's the least I can do other than tell everyone I meet in person if they have car issues! Go here!

Pretty good for takeout. Decent prices especially since all orders get garlic bread and whole orders get a salad. Salad would be nice if it didn't have onions, I always throw it away. Ive had a few of the dishes and some are excellent whereas others are average.  Stuffed Shells, pretty good but made differently each time it seems, sometimes they're more open face and melted or titled to the side with crumbly cheese in them. I prefer closed and stiffer shells myself.  Mac n Cheese, all the rage in the reviews but I can't see why. Penne with melted cheese on the bottom. Some of the top pasta was dry with no cheese. I could melt a cheese blend in a pot and pour it over pasta myself. Making a spice blend or crumbly baked mac in cheese is more effort so I'd pay someone to do that. I'll eat it but won't order again.  Meatball Sandwich, very decent, big, saucy.  Pizza, decent, would order from time to time.  Quaint (but very small and busy) eating area. Great alcohol selection but I couldn't find much merlot next to the wine. Great deli and for picking up your own ingredients.

Seriously the worst Cheba Hut ever. I've been to all the AZ ones multiple times and I still think the Mesa one across from MCC is the best.  The staff are disorganized, talk about each other behind their backs or right in front of each other, the cashier repeatedly asked for my order although I told her all the specifications as soon as I got up there and they STILL got my order wrong and my friend's, horribly wrong. There were 2 people ahead of us and we had to wait over 40 minutes. I could imagine they'd be slow with how much slacking they were doing. On top of that they got my name wrong, like terribly wrong, just not even possible to get that name from my actual name, which I said slowly and looked the cashier in the eye while doing it to make sure it was right.  Also a girl with dyed hair insulted me while I was standing right in front of her and looked directly at me and I hadn't even said anything to the staff or customers. It made no sense. I felt like I was transported to another dimension on crazy pills like everyone was out of touch with what is acceptable and decent and what is not.  I've included a photo of my friend's sandwich that has items on it that don't even come in that combination, that he didn't ask for, the wrong main meat and extra pepperoni with sauce for no apparent reason with one half piece of soggy bacon. It was also ice cold and he threw it out with a grumbling tummy. If you've got the munchies you want a reliable sandwich shop! #icanteven  Funny enough I was there as a business rep for a popular industry company that will remain nameless and they sure we nice to me then, guess they don't care about their "average consumers".

If they weren't at a convenient location by ASU I swear...  This one is not on the ball. The sandwiches were correct(ish) and timely but the staff left me perplexed. I wasn't asked at the beginning or end if I wanted any added toppings, which I thought was standard practice but whatever. Then when I asked for toppings I was looked at like I was weird... Excuse meee! Tasted good but the "Dank" is always sloppy, maybe people like but I don't, the bread is not crisp, soggy somehow, with sauce that spills out when picking it up and that makes the pepperoni slide out with the cheese... But this that the offense deserving of one star? No, but their communication is.   I got a PRIVATE message from that manager/owner asking for my PHONE number to figure out what went wrong when my review is pretty black and white spelled out. It's not my fault or my job to talk about what the staff did wrong. Whatever needs to be said can be in an email or message. If I was just believed and spoken with decently I wouldn't be so disgruntled. I still drive 30min+ to visit the mcc one so the ingredients aren't the issue.

If I could rate it 2.5 I would, and in my opinion it's 3 stars, but 2 = "Meh" on yelp.  The food here is average, a little quick and sloppy, especially at night with the college frat boy kid rush. The security / ID checkers are pretty nice, the waitresses and hostess are pretty air headed, I've been here around 5 times, same experience each time. For example, I asked "Did you see me come in here with ___?" Both girls at the front stared at me blankly, "Umm... I dunno, I don't really pay attention, ha sorry." Then they went back to talking to each other before I could respond.   Macayo's always has pretty cool events though, but those are separate producers of course, they never have enough events at the back area events either... staff is also pretty rude to me, and I'm always event staff, ignoring me and complaining when I said the main staff didn't get any food.  This place is good for people looking to scarf down some quick faux Mexican food, preferably a young person, college crowd, "bro", "frat", idk I assume someone that likes fart jokes. I does not appear to be good for children or families to me... not good for dancing. Get's 21+ around....7pm I think. Awhile ago I went with some older friends around 9, there was literally no one there, odd night, and 1 security guard with the kitchen still open. My friends went inside and used the rest room, got a couple drinks and I stood outside shouting to them by the ledge. Then we left.

On any day I'd give Spinato's a 5 star, the pizza, the best and that's all the matters to me. Great thin crust, sweet sauce, savory cheese... However I called the Tempe location for 20min straight while driving only to get there and see they're closed for a kitchen remodeling. What the hell? I checked Google hours, Yelp and the site to make sure of the hours and there's NO NOTICE. Told everyone I was bringing zah and I was by the Phoenix location but decided to go to Tempe because my final stop was closer... Thanks a lot.

TERRIBLE place. Awful styling, poor manners, and poor morals. RUDE. RUDE. RUDE. Lies! Hate disabled/handicapped people.  PREFACE I recently had an injury that left me disabled, I can't stand for that long or move my arms essentially above my waist without serve pain and strain; I walk with a limp and I have no strength for pushing, pulling, lifting, etc. Therefore, I can't wash my hair on my own so I went in for a simple hair wash only.   FRONT DESK  I originally went to Sport Clips across the street because I had been to their other locations and thought it was nice... but  I wanted them to use my own special order shampoo and they said SC can't do it, but  FS *can* use shampoo you bring in and "do it all the time". So I struggle into FS huffing and puffing, door hitting me because I couldn't open it all the way... arrive at the front desk to ask for a hair wash and explicitly state I have my own shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo was open but the conditioner was sealed with all ingredients listed. The woman at the front assured me 3x it was completely OK and yes they've done it before.  STYLIST The "stylist" I got was "Ariel", she had dyed red hair, who btw asked me repeatedly if I wanted a style (more money) but I explained the disability again and hence why I'm only coming in for a wash. She set me in a chair that the leg rest was down, I asked her if she could move it up and she told me it was broken. I informed her again I'm injured and can't sit with my back in a curve and legs down. Didn't seem to care, just said oh we'll do it quick. I then asked her to use my shampoo because it's for my sensitive scalp and curly hair. Ariel said they never do it and never have done it for illegal issues because they "don't know what's in it" and could be sued, and I said the front desk woman said you did. She flippantly said oh she's new... then I told her the SC people said you do and she brushed it off. I expressed I didn't like the SC shampoo although it seems to work for other people. She also bashed SC products, saying it leaves you "dry". She refused to tell me what was in the FS shampoo too.   SERVICE/SHAMPOO Worst shampoo/hair wash ever. I didn't feel her touch my scalp once and I very clearly have thick dandruff/product on my scalp. I didn't get a head massage or scratch either. That's no way to get hair clean. I said I didn't like menthol either and it really smelled like it to me. I didn't want to say anything because I was in such pain I cried a little. Every other hair wash station opened up so I didn't get why she didn't move me. I got it combed out and was left with a cheesy menthol/mint smelling film in my hair. I didn't get help with the door either and everyone just stared at me.  PRICE It was $8, wasn't worth $2 or my $4 tip.

Took over a hour to get our food,  order was wrong so had to wait again... Didn't take it off the menu with either wanted to charge us for a refill too. Didn't check on us much, no apologies and we had to ask for the check. Soda was still almost $3. I got water, I know how nickel and dime this place can be. Used to love them, now... Nevermind. Server was chill but lacked emotion and enthusiasm, tired maybe, but dealing with that wrong order was wack...

David's seems kind of hit or miss. I've been several times and the first time was definitely the best that got me hooked. I always get the burger (plain) with fries and a milkshake. I love the food, cooked well, nice seasoning and great shakes!  I think the price is right for what you get, the decorations are really cute, like diner and pinup-ish, however the staff seems really annoyed by idk questions about the food or asking for a side of sauce or whatever. They looked at me like I was crazy when I asked to get my menu back to see what kind of flavors they have for ice cream, "Well, you can just go look..." OKAY, but I'm asking you now, then I explained I wanted shake flavors and she told me a couple. I got up and looked at the menu later and would have ordered different ones if I had gotten my menu back. Shake my head. I definitely don't let that get me down though with how cozy the place is and yummy the food is!  Usually it's not that busy with plenty of seating and occasionally they have obscure performers, first time I was there they had a duel piano player, haven't seen him since though.   Decor: 4/5 Staff: 2.5/5 Food: 4/5 Wait: 4/5 Price: 4/5

4 Stars because there's nothing terrible about them, painting was precise but also not wowing me.  Location The crossroads are Scottsdale and Curry on the west side. It was kind hard to find... it has a private lot which is about car lengths width, so be careful.  Interior  There was nice modern nice deco, it was clean and smelled pleasant. Spacious as well for a small place.  Pedicure I got a basic by a younger soft spoken tech. It was a very delicate massage, almost made me wish for another massage.... maybe you'd have better luck if you asked for it harder. I found it odd the used cuticle oil for the massage as well. The hot stones included in every pedi were warmish and more like brushed against me... I've gotten hot stones on my back and it surprisingly hot with deep kneading which is what I hoped for. They didn't use foot file like other places I've been to at least not with the basic. I didn't get the  callus remover  because the bottles are no name without ingredients listed which can be dangerous.  Used latex gloves which I found weird as a lot of people are allergic, including me, just not severely. However the painting was very precise, he took his time and wasn't rushed by 4 people waiting like I see other techs react sometimes.  Chair The massage chair offers a slow and light lull, no lumbar option although the remote has one, and it turns off after 10 min.  Prices They had really good refill full set prices in my opinion, and some of the pedicure and manicures have different prices than online, some higher, some lower. Maybe call ahead to be sure.

I am not getting these good reviews... Maybe they're just not as on the ball in the morning as they should be... I felt like I was being talked down to the whole time. I entered and others followed, I made sure to walk far away from and turn away from the counter to signal I'm not in line but instead of a ma'am I realize I'm just being stared at by staff and I think I could have kept staring for awhile so I just said they can all go. Then since there are no labels and I'm not a donut connoisseur or psychic I had to... I don't know ask what they were with filled with? I asked for what flavor something is but I got it on my other donuts instead and had to repeat over and over that it was a question.  Next I attempted to order a sandwich, I had to explain I only wanted one sandwich even after saying the specifics and describing the picture. I asked what was on it and like duhhh "everything you see there" oh I'm sorry the tiny picture across from me that is CLOSED face tells me everything. Whatever, fine... I finally pay and wait for it wait for it, because I sure did, I'm asked why I'm still there, I don't know... Waiting for my sandwich... Got it, wasn't appetizing, thank you, bye.

This gas station DOES exist and they are the best! Now, to be honest because it's on the reservation the gas, soda pop and food prices are slightly high and the soda fountain is lacking. However, the parking lot is well lit, well maintained, wide for trucks with tons of parking. There's also a drive thru for tobacco and huge selection inside, can't say what because I've never been but looks massive.   Above all, they're the best because the staff is very considerate and seem tight knit, I'd say it's quite likely they do all know each other. When I thought it possible I lost something in the parking lot they went out of their way to ask all the staff and check security footage for me. Didn't find it, but I was so grateful for the peace of mind!

Don't go! I wished I read the reviews before ordering my coupon. The desk staff were actually super nice, or so I thought, and let me redeem before it expired so I could get my massage in. I had to fill out what looked like a doctor form although it was just a massage! I didn't fill in my address because I didn't see the point, I wasn't getting mail or a bill. They seemed really irritated by that, nothing I've experienced at a spa / office doctor massage appt either.  The pressure from the massage was out of this world hard, I normally have to tell my masseuse to do it to the point where they think it actually might hurt, but during this I shed a tear. I wanted some areas that much pressure and others not, and she kept told me to stop tightening and said when I go over a knot people often stop breathing and tighten up - uh, yea, that should tell you something. Always respond to your client and adjust accordingly. I told her I wanted full body, but she just focused on my shoulders and didn't even go over my feet and tailbone which I circled as concern areas, didn't go over my front legs, arms, hands, temples, and I had to ask her to do my back legs. Then she finished 4 min early, most masseuses are super nice and tell me they're going right up to the last minute.  I've never thought, "I wonder when this will be over..." during a massage, I'm a massage addict, I've been many different places all over the world so I have a good idea of a "good massage".  She used a mint smelling lotion, I didn't get any options, surprised she didn't use or offer oil, I mean, I figured I'd be asked if I had any allergies like they usually do on their forms in offices and spas. I like that oily soft feeling afterward, but I didn't get that with this lotion.

Great service on the phone, friendly staff and knowledge esthetician. Wanted an under arm wax and was pleasantly surprised that first brow or underarm is free! Very quick process. I said I hated hard wax and prefer soft so that's what I got. I tried the Euro Wax Center awhile back and they said they only use hard wax so I wanted to try somewhere else. I've tried soft honey, soft pink and blue hard wax and I'm a small portion of people that find hard hurts way more! Very accommodating.

Helllooo... Thirsty Lion! I feel welcome back. Their happy hour is the place to be, reasonable prices for quality food and portions. Plus, it helped that the server was cute! So I'm a little biased but he was also funny and charismatic. He said something very real that I won't repeat here that made me like him more.   A lot of restaurants lack servers who can make you feel comfortable. Very patient with giving me time to look again and again andddd order and to ask questions. Got the chicken strips which were seasoned awesomely and some pulled pork I was ready to hide because I did not want to share! Plus fries were great as always. As for my beverage I tried a yummy Grapefruit Greyhound, I'm usually really particular about my alcohol and I don't normally like bitters but this might be a new favorite... Having such a wonderful experience I now have a lot more to try on the menu.   Only thing that kind of threw me was that the staff were all having their snack, break, lunch whatever in the cushioned window corner which is my favorite place to sit. It makes sense for that location and I would totally sit there if I worked there but it distracted me and I still wanted to sit there. I saw a lot of long reserved tables for business meetings and people at the bar so I figured most people wouldn't notice or sit near the windows like I would.

This place is still awesome! I love you, Thirsty Lion, and that's a very difficult compliment to get from me. This place always turns it out, staff is always attentive and on point and every time I try something new, it's good! Tried the Fresh Fruit Sangria, bit odd flavor choice of you ask me, only order of you like brandy as that's the main ingredient, not as fruity or sugary as you'd think.

I really wanted to like this place, I really did. I've been to the ASU location once before and it was pretty good however this one did not live up to those expectations. The staff were good at explaining what everything was as I was confused on the order. Ordered pulled pork sandwich, Mac and fried onion strings. Also my friend got a rack of ribs and a sandwich. I was so excited but when I got home to eat I realized there was no sauce, my god, isn't that what they're famous for? BBQ...with sauce?   Who orders all that meat and doesn't expect sauce? Which I'm told they always provide. No thanks. Meat was very dry otherwise and bun was spongey... And they have free ice cream? No one told me that... I love ice cream. Plus my sandwich came with onions and pickles on it, meanwhile I said several times I hadn't been there before and didn't know what all came on the sandwich and I was assured it was just meat. I would have specified just meat yet again if I had been told that or read that.   I didn't finish the sandwich, the strings were good and the Mac was alright but it's really glorified melted cheese on pasta.  **Comment Response**: I don't know how to private message nor did I think users could message establishments. I think they/you can message users, if you want any more information you could always message me your contact info (phone, email, times to call, etc.) to discuss it.

This place is just not that good, I don't know, just saying. The staff was pretty rude and sarcastic, they constantly were asking for our order when I was clearly visually upset and not ready, was having a bad day is all, still I felt rushed. The brat was average, fries were pretty good, but I wouldn't care to have them again. I liked that they had RC and various sodas. Also there's no parking and rude people block the path out and street by taking pictures, so plan accordingly. ; )

Literally might be one of the worst hotels in the world, minus 3rd world hotels and cockroach motels.   Basically, it's dirty, smokey, has sketchy strange people... and the hotel staff are very rude. I went to the pool for an event, it was free for hotel people, around $25 per person to the public, hotel raised the price that the producer had set.   They didn't know what event I was talking about or who the producer was, I asked if I could look around or look for them and they said no even though I was fine going with security so I didn't run off. I couldn't have run off, the event was 3 areas, 2 rooms, 1 HIDDEN (my friend's area) and 1 outside. Was too loud to call my friend, no DJ, but a metal band. They wouldn't let the DJ hook up the music and refused to get a liquor license. I also got patted down, saving myself from less of a pat down by pulling my pockets out and shaking my clothes - I'm a small girl with skin tight girl shorts and spaghetti strap... yea I'm packing?  I hear they're under new management since then, hope so!

I've been to this Hooters at least 5x and I don't like the wings, but I don't like wings so what do I know.   I always come with a large group and they all enjoy the heck out of it. They're very accommodating if you plan in advance or one the spot as well. They also take great lengths to make gluten free wings and non seasoned fries. Which the curly fries are rather nice.   I tried my luck with a Tom Collins and although it tastes quite sour, maybe too much lemon or the club soda, it has the proper alcohol ratio and garnish. No one everrr gets the garnish right, most people think it's a lime but it's orange and cherry, so well done.   Tried the key lime pie, my fav, and it tasted a little staticy like a refrigerator if that makes sense so I won't order again but I ate it...well half of it   Finally after yrs they did the birthday song I've longed to hear and the women were great. Very funny. Normally I get a better than you, vapid vibe from the competitors waitresses but they were fun to talk to and didn't seem "down" on me.   Only problem I have with them in general is my several rejected applications despite sales, marketing, hosting and bar tending experience and my friends telling me I have great hooters, it was implied to me I should apply without curly hair... Do you ever see particularly dark or curly ladies? Wish I did.

This is a really nice Spirit, they have everything it seems organized and crammed into the little hallways they make. I think the jewelry, hosiery and goddess section is more extensive than the Tempe one. Oddly enough, these items are $1-$2 less on the Spirit website, and don't they have the in store pickup option?   There's a lot of mannequin halves showing off costumes in every section, I'm not sure the Tempe location has that. The decorations and outdoor display section was smaller, hence the smaller space than the Tempe location but still really good. Same children's costumes too.  All the staff were really nice, asking me if I needed anything and engaging in playful banter. The cashier was patient and kind, took no for an answer to email and accepted my coupon very quickly. Sometimes the other Spirit stores hassle about either.  Only issue is it's by a Hooters and intoxicated people as well as up too late cranky children come in.

This place should be ashamed of themselves! Waited 15min for someone to take my order, writing this while waiting! Where are the wait staff? Finally someone comes up to me and I'm too ticked to give this place my business... Got dressed up with my date and had my whole menu planned out. Disappointed. I saw 3 waitresses come next to me but they were too busy having their friends over like chatty Kathys. It's dead and I wanna give you my money but the 20 waitresses (not literally) won't do their jobs! No thank you.

I went back for a shampoo and style and I'm glad I did. Ms. Charlotte was more through and my hair was left squeaky clean and fairly straight. Overall the whole process took about 50min I'd say.   I was pretty comfortable, both the wash and heat from the blow dryer were adequate. A hands touching scalp wash is a sign of a great cleaning. I also didn't feel like the heat was too much or hurt. The flat iron was pretty quick right at the end. Now I need a cut and I'd look forward to going back!   Oddest thing happened, after I got home, that night, my neck nape or under hairs started to get a little wavy, no big deal. Although, the next morning it was all puffy and curly but I ran over it with my flat iron to get it as flat as a pancake and it stayed straight just like that for over a week with any iron. Not sure why that is.

What's the fuss about? Oh, nothing.  I was so excited when I heard a Portillo's was opening in the Phoenix area! Oh my gosh, I loved the Portillo's in Chicago, but... this is just, no. I don't even know if I should really be reviewing it under the same umbrella because this new trend of taking quality sit down Midwestern food (Steak n Shake, etc.) and turning it into... well, whatever on the west coast is disturbing.   Where to start, well for one every time I've been there they've gotten mine or someone else's order wrong. The burgers are not what I remember, some flavorless non-juicy knock off. The shakes taste worse than fast food syrup concoctions sitting out overnight and the hot dog is sub-par at best. I am all for people enjoying whatever they want but I respectfully think you're wrong. In addition, there's something about the onion rings in that every time I order them they don't agree with me in a way I don't experience else where.   Although, on the bright side, usually the cashiers are very pleasant, patient and suggestive. The deco is alright as well. However the wait is fairly long, I remember this from before but I figured I'd get the same quality. The outside area is very nice but on several attempts some staff has attempted to take my food... I don't know why, hyper eager preemptive cleaning?

Actually kind of surprised this place has such low reviews, but I'd agree. Let's be honest, a lot of AZ and Cali natives don't know a good hamburger when they see one and hop onto the new hype easily, no offence! I'm from Chicago and we are all about keeping good food and service around in the Midwest!  I used to eat at SnS in Illinois pretty often, I liked that it was sit down and diner style. Kind of disturbed at this new trend of making nice quaint restaurants into impersonal fast food shacks. I had a plain burger and fries and my friend had some toppings on the burger with fries and a shake. I was kind of shocked at how mediocre the shake was, really disheartening. The burger seemed slightly undercooked and the bun was cold and soft/mushy... fries were average, not what I remember! They messed up our order 2x times and had to wait over 30min to get it right, thank goodness we had time or I be really p-oed. Actually found out they had forgotten about us as well (idk how that happens!).  I finished the burger cause I was starving by then but I couldn't finish the fries and that never happens! Ouch. Oh and by the way, it is most certainly NOT* the "In n Out of the Midwest". I like I-n-O alright but the actual SnS in the Midwest is a much higher supreme creation.

Moonshine aplenty here! They use Ole Smokey in a lot of unique cocktails. Was here before working as event staff and the weekend crowd was definitely rowdy towards the staff ladies so I didn't know if I'd go on a Saturday. Really peaceful during the week. Great happy hour prices.   The patio is warm with 3 heaters and a fireplace but I'd recommend closed toe during nights.   Host was very approachable and accommodating. I believe I spoke with the manager for my order and he was very patient and chill.   We ordered the "Flapper" which is basically a strawberry mimosa with Ole Smokey. Pretty good, cute presentation. In addition the pulled pork and honey wings and beef brisket.

I'm going to start off this review by saying I did NOT receive service at this salon. Here is why - I called late morning and the women who answered had a thick accent and seemed not to know English too well. That's not a problem with me, my old stylist is Russian... but this new woman was hard to understand.  I started off by asking, "I was wondering do you have appt today at ___ for ___. I was asking about hair styling, she said yes, then she said okay you'll come, and I said well just wait a minute, I need to clarify my services, and I described what I wanted, on the website there was a listed price, she spoke in what I assumed was Russian to another woman and then quoted me at $10 more than their "max" price.   Then I went on to say, "Okay thank you, I'll think about it." She said so you're coming? Again, I said, no, I was just wondering about your pricing. Yes, you're coming today? Again I said.... No I was merely "curious" about your services. Silence... I said, "I was just curious about the price, thank you." So you are okay with appt today? I said, "I would be okay with it if I was booking, but I am not booking I'm calling other salons." I had to explain 3 times "I am calling other salons, I was just curious, just wondering." Then a long silence, and she said "(my name)" and I said yes? Then she said, "Goodbye!" It seemed like she didn't understand English because that's not a good selling technique, it's poor customer service.  The reviews on here seem to only be about eyebrows, maybe that was a clue... and all they're good at. I judge a business by their respect, patience, and fairness in pricing, i.e keeping their word on their OWN website.

This place is amazeballs. I can't believe I drove by this place and went to the plaza so much without going in. There seemed to be a language barrier in figuring out what I wanted. I've never had fakes or acrylics before and I was asking about polish versus gel and what have you. Just in case you're wondering, acrylics can be tips or full cover and require no polish other than the clear top coat, and no gel and especially not the mood color changing polish that was attempted to be pushed on me.  The chairs are pretty comfy with a nice massagers but not all remotes are responsive. The tub has cool varying lights and powerful jets. Granted, circulating jets (without a plastic cover aka directly on your feet) can be unhygienic.   Glitter, clear, solid color, holiday designs are just some of the tips they offer. The techs can do a variety of designs as well. A lot of polishes to choose from, OPI too. Oh and just a nail salon tip is sometimes there's germs or diluted bottles so I recommend bringing it from home if that concerns you.  I don't think the pedicure was that amazing, although I take really good care of my feet sometimes some skin becomes rough so it's not that difficult to scrub off but so far Tim hasn't gotten it. I actually look forward to an appointment with Kimmy some time in the future.  The absolute best part is the acrylics are amazing. Even doing the quick and bubbly under the nail version we've seen techs is these babies do not come off. I try to dry my fingers of moisture and use gloves when using shampoo or washing dishes and I use my skin and not fake tips to type/pick up things... but still, I've grabbed things, slammed my fingers and opened bottle tops without any ripping. Although I did have some pain that lasted weeks under my nail when I dropped my hair brush on my finger. Oh wells - they're so pretty! I can see my nails and saw them without tips recently and there's no residue, damage or peeling.  There's several things I don't like, for example, the techs judging other people and talking about them, but the quality is overshadowed by my moral qualms. Keep in mind there's only 2 techs, I know the quantity of chairs is deceiving.   They accept credit, debit and cash, they, like all nail techs prefer cash tips.

Still love this place, very regular, came more times than I've remembered to check in. Only place I trust with acrylics, quality of nail doesn't matter as much as a good tech does. Great glue and nail work. Tim is a bit absent minded and doesn't always recognize me but I notice that with a lot of males in general.  Finally had a few pedis with Kimmie... She pays attention to my toe health and explains her steps. Had a nail injury and she fixed it and explained how to care for it at home. Very meticulous about her work. Loves to talk family and kids, comes off like a real person.  I recommend the Classic Combo (Basic Mani n Pedi for $30) then try add ons like paraffin wax or callous remover, I don't like Sugar Scrubs myself. Also if you make an appointment it might not start on time, could be 5 to 30min delay but you're in the queue still.

I don't know how there's so many good reviews. Maybe they just offered a discount for a good yelp review, I've seen a lot of salons do that.   I arrived 10min early for my appointment to be polite, I know that walk-ins welcome too though. I probably stood at the reception desk for 5 minutes straight. No one greeted me or asked if I needed help but everyone did look at me; the girl I found out later to be the receptionist finally stopped talking to the nail tech and said, "Yes? What do you want?"  I told her I was there for my appointment and it was my first pedi ever, which I actually called earlier that day to confirm again, and she then asked if I had an appointment. After some silence she told me to pick out a color, I actually thought there'd be more color choices, it was mostly pink and red, so I did and came back, then she told me to sit down, looking at me like I had 2 heads and I was totally stupid.   Finally I waited 10 more min and got seated with Richie. He seemed distracted the whole time, I think looking at the owner or head woman, he even dropped the nail polish while mean muggin' her and she wasn't even looking. It seemed to have a catty, selfish, vibe, I gathered they were arguing about money and the receptionist was trying to overcharge and had to be scolded. Then I was told move down while I was drying even though there was only 1 person at the opposite end because a family came in, and they didn't even all have pedi appointments, they actually said that in front of the techs, not surprised they wouldn't pay attention though.   I saw my same tub kind of splashed with what I thought was alcohol, but not wiped at the bottom or at all and filled up with the blue flake stuff. I really hoped I wouldn't get an infection after I saw that. When I was drying Richie gave my coupon to the receptionist and when I paid and asked for it back she said she never got it, even THOUGH she explained I got a discount. Then she went back to Richie and came back and gave it to me so I could use the other coupons on the flyer. Like you don't want me to come back or get $2 off? OK? Also, cash only tips.  There was a weird scuff left on my nail that's not natural and some polish left on my skin, but I thought it was pretty.  I would only recommend to go if it's a surprise gift or you have a coupon and really really really need it. I didn't get the point of the basic spa pedi, basically it looks like what any girl could go with a small tub soak, scrubbing pad/stone, and nice polish. It didn't look or feel different, just glossier because of the bottom and top coat used.   Decor: 3/5 Staff: 2/5 Clean: 3/5 Wait: 1/5 Pedi: 3/5 Polish Staying Power: 4/5

Pretty good. Loving the reserved seating. Staff is always great, lots of breathing room upstairs and in the halls. Wide concession and drink selection. Usually clean, 24hrs customer service.

414 is actually pretty awesome. Look at my other reviews and you'll notice I'm not only through and conclusive in my ratings but harsh sometimes too. My friends are like wow, if 414 impresses you...!   I've only ever had the pizza slices they have under the heat lamps and the soda I guess. So my experience might be a bit different but I think it's the best grab and go thin crust style in the Phoenix area. I used to be all about "Slices" but now I'm like 414, 414! They have a great lunch special and pretty reasonable prices.  I've been about 8 times before and it's a nice place to relax, eat and not get bothered (ahem ladies) or party and have a laugh all night long. Security here is very personable and alert so that's good on Mill ave. I actually had an annoying recent experience which is why it gets 4 and not 5 stars. After Summer Ends music fest I got 2 slices and the prices were outrag-high plus I stood there for 10mins exhausted just staring until anyone talked to me and then waited another 10 to get my food *and* waited to pay. Points for not running off?  They also have karaoke which I hate, just loathe as a concept and I think most people can't sing, but a lot of band geeks and opera nerds trickle in from End Game bar to eat so you actually can get a better good show.

Ashley the stylist was amazing! I saw she was recommended a lot and for good reason. I'm always worried about younger or new stylists being lazy or inexperienced with very (black) curly hair but she was very quick and got it almost totally straight with the blow drier. Was there about a hour, washing, deep conditioning and five min. scalp massage included. She was very nice as well, I felt like I was talking to a girlfriend. Would definitely go back!

Please DO NOT stay here, I urge you! This place is HORRIBLE. No lights in room. 3HRS+ wait for a TV tech. Staff that LIE.  WOW. Just, wow, I am astonished a popular hotel in a popular American city could be this horrible. I've stayed in hotels all around the world, the WORLD, the East and West coast of the US, Southern US, several South America locations, and the Caribbean/Islands and I can honesty say this is by far the worst hotel I have ever seen. You'd think with how much money they make from tours and the casino they could employee competent staff. Think again!  The staff really make this hotel an awful experience. I had to call the front desk at least 4x for problems with my room. I couldn't see anything in the bed/living area because I only found a bathroom light and a shadow dim light pointing downward on the wall. I have no visions problems, but I couldn't even read the phone buttons it was so dark. The woman at the front desk said that's just how they are designed, but house keeping told me the rooms are supposed to have lamps. YA THINK!? It took 45min to get the lamp so I sat there waiting to be able to unpack. I was told I couldn't be comped anything until I hassled and got the resort fee taken off ($25) when all I wanted was a $7 breakfast item in the morning. How does that make sense?! But sure, take the more expensive route.  Next, the TV doesn't work, after being wrongly transferred and stuck in a queue for 10min, I'm told twice a tech will be out "right away", and all be damned if it's not 3 hrs later and I'm writing this review waiting for that tech. The words I have for the West Gate cannot be written here. I am shaking with anger and frustration, I started crying on the phone because the staff refused to help me and all I wanted was to get a lamp and working TV so I could go out to get my first meal of the day after working 10hrs at a trade show.   UPDATE: I left and never get a working TV. It's weeks later and they didn't refund me the resort fee. I will be calling to complain.   Outside appearance The grounds and foliage were neat. The lots were well lite with plenty of staff around.  Inside appearance The hotel appears clean and polished, help desks and resources anywhere, although that apparently means nothing.  Parking Parking is complementary, no paper to put in your window, just valet or self. Even on a fully booked night you could find first level parking.  Room The room was clean, mine had pretty big floor space with a queen bed on a high up floor. The room was a connecting one and I could hear word for word the neighbors conversations. They charge you for bottled water, don't be a fool and drink it. There's a Keurig coffee maker for free use I believe. The view on some sides can be pretty dark so the lights won't bother you. There's a LG TV and Energy-Star fridge. There's little soaps and such, all in one shower and tub. Minor modern deco. Thick curtains for blocking the sun.

They staff here are really great and accommodating. There's an amazing selection of main dishes, beverages and baked goods. I wanted to try it all. Went in the evening.   I went with a hamburger and fries. The steak fries were a little soft unfortunately. The burger had a cool croissant bun but I wish they toasted it more because it made my burger soggy, which was a little pink although I asked for medium well, I'm assuming I'd have to ask for well done to be medium...   I tried the house coffee black, which was excellent, and Noreo house made oreo, was like a sugar cookie without sugar and cream paste, was really cold after sitting out, but dipping in coffee helped. Although I still didn't like it. I used the check in yelp deal which I was told they had never heard of...   The wait staff asked if we were good, refills, whatever, but the male at the bakery counter was kind of rude and matter of factly. The woman I'm assuming is the manager was lovely, very kind woman, there were also fire fighters taking care of an elderly man who seemed to have been there before so that was nice of the restaurant.   I look forward to trying their refined drinks, they have a lot of older drinks I'd think young people aren't familiar with which impressed me for an ASU area establishment .

I was so happy to see this place pop up but my excitement was short lived when I saw the prices. $6 for a small box of cheese curds? Oh honey! They're bomb but it prevents me from ordering anything else. 3 star for the prices and slight wait, but 4 stars for quality, staff professionalism and ambiance / decor. Just remember fries (and curds) are a meal! But that's it, don't fix yourself to order anything more or you'll question if that total was correct.  In response to the owner's comments: I didn't want to mention the poutine because I hate poutine, I've had it before, unlike other people it's not a wacky new thing to me. I generally do not like toppings or condiments and I hate gravy. If they even scaled their prices back by .99 it would be that more affordable. OR give even 30% more cheese curds because what you get for the mandatory large size is not a lot compared to the other sides.

Walked in and had to look at staff to get them to greet me. I'm the only person in here and I'm trying to use my $20 Groupon, I have to explain I can only use it one time and I want the max amount, but instead I get a $5 of food. The cashier tried to insist I can only get 1 order and I read the fine print back and forth myself. Then they confess to not listening to me. Well, that explains it. Overpriced food too, I've tried this establishment so many times and it's always something. One guy was nice awhile back but I don't see him anymore.

It wasn't my cup of tea. My water hurt my lady bits like hell, all the salt and it was cold in like 5minutes and only luke warm when I got in. I'm a master at soaking myself in big tubs but I kept bumping the sides and could barely stretch out and I'm 5'7.

Dumb, dumb, dumb as rocks here. Ordered a combo and it ended up in 3 different bags separate with another meal, wasn't spicy like ordered either. Then tried to order a single item off the kids menu which I know they can do but they insisted that item didn't exist as a meal OR item and I'm staring right at it. Ordered a side, didn't get that in my bag either, also ordered a drink and they neglected to tell me they removed it from the order but we still ended up with a kids meal bag? I have no idea... We even said we'd wait and we did wait a few minutes, I'm fine with that but don't tell me you don't have items I can see,  convince me to get something else and then not even give it to me properly.

For some reason Yelp will not update this page to help patients get to the new location. Even people I know who went to the Bell road location didn't all know it is now at Scottsdale and Shea.  As far as the review goes, Doctor Reynoso is amazing, and I'm always skeptic to endorse a doctor because I've had so many fall short. I have several conditions and the combination of which plus my age makes my case really rare. This is the only doctor that believed me when I said something was wrong. I've been to countless doctors, specialists, physical therapy, etc. and after a few visits and implementation of suggested treatment I feel like a new person. He also understands who has good intentions and who doesn't. Old doctors accused me of making stuff up although I wasn't asking for anything, he actually believes I experience the pain and fatigue I do and is careful to work with me on it. The office staff and billing program needs work. I have heard of them making appointments that could be solved via mail/e-mail, overbooking and have 1hr+ waits, but I'd wait 2 hours to see Reynoso. I don't think a lot of these problems are his fault.
