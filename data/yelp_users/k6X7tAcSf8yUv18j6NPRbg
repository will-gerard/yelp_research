OMG, what a nightmare!!!   They are super nice guys but have no clue wtf they are doing!!!! I was having such problems with my iphone 6, a phone I purchased in Jan of this year and kept having weird issues, such as it not keeping a charge or running hot. The apple staff readily admitted there was an issue with the phone but did NOTHING to make it right. I had already taken it back to AT&T a couple times and they kept telling me it was fine, but it wasn't. Eventually I went to another provider and purchased yet another apple product - the iphone 6 plus - which I can only blame on my own stupidity but I have an ipad and have been using apple products for years.    However, I needed the info from my old phone to be transferred over to my new phone or at the very least backed up to the cloud before trading it in for a nominal fee/credit, much. much  less than what I had paid just a few months prior. Regardless, since I was having such difficulties I went over to the apple store in Chandler and 3 hours later walked out with less than 25% of my data backed up or moved and my old phone completed wiped clean, with a explanation that now the phone would probably work properly...which is complete bull crap!!!   It's so disappointing that apple really doesn't stand behind their products, that you have to wait for hours for service, that you get conflicting information, and that the cloud doesn't always work as intended. I am screwed, again more than 75% of my contacts, pictures, text messages and data on my phone is just gone. The back-up (that the apple employees conducted not me) shows as not complete - it didn't work!!!! Thus, I trusted people who are suppose to be trained and fully knowledgeable on their product, when in all reality they have no clue what the hell they are doing. I wonder how they would like it if i took their phone and wiped 75% of all their information then handed it back and said "here you go, you are all set to go." Needless to say, I'm not at all a happy apple consumer

Pacific Moon may appear to be your typical Chinese restaurant, but the food and flavors are anything but typical. Having had the Hot & Sour Soup as well as the Szechwan Chicken, I found both to be very fresh and super delicious. I would without hesitation recommend Pacific Moon to anyone looking for exceptional Chinese food in the Fountain Hills area. I know I'll certainly be returning in the very near future.

I called Freedom movers at the last minute and they were able to accommodate my move with no problem. In addition, they were on time, professional, fast and extremely efficient - they did a great job!!!  I would highly recommend them and will definitely use them for my next move.
