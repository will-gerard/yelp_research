Stopped by for dinner after going to the Phoenix Zoo.  This was a great find!  We had two large thin crust pizzas and orders of bbq and hot wings.  The pizza crust was the thinnest I've ever had and it was wonderfully crispy.  The toppings were great and fresh parmesan tossed over the pizza after it was served to the table made it perfect.  The hot wings were some of the best I've ever tasted.  Outdoor seating in the courtyard was neat with overhead heaters, but we had a party of 10.  Long wait for outdoor seating made us decide on an inside seating.  It was still great, although I think the outdoor seating would have been even better.  They don't take call in reservations, by the way.  Great service, great food.  We'll go back again for sure.

Food was decent but the waitstaff absolutely sucks.  Super rude and condescending.  Not worth the time or money.  Stay away.

I've eaten here twice and had sandwiches both times.  The Philly Cheese Steak is really good here.  Had a house salad with it to share and it was large and fresh. Overall a good experience and will go again.

Great food and service.  I was impressed with the quality of the frybread.  The salsa samples were great too.  Good selection of toppings from very mild to spicy hot.

Good deal on color printing here. They charge by the amount of coverage on the page, so color prints can be less expensive if there is a lot of white space in your document.  Quick turnaround and personal service. Definitely worth using and a local small business as well.

Great food here. Super meaty ribs and tasty sauce.  I was impressed with the rib meal. Bought a rack to take home as well.

Great burgers and lots of fries in the meal. Not like fast food burgers.  These are like the old school loaded up diner style burgers.    Friendly and attentive staff.  Been a pretty solid line since we got here.  I'd recommend trying it.  We'll be back again.

Great food in a nice,  almost upscale atmosphere.  Attentive, but not annoying service.    I had the kung pao chicken which was spiced perfectly. Like that slow burn,  hurts so good level but not burning your lips off hot. Really nice portion sizes and the egg roll,  cheese puff and egg drop soup are all nice included additions.   What's amazing is the price! $5.95 lunch special makes if almost too good to be true... But it is.   Needless to say, I'll be back.
