I went to this place because it was the most reasonably priced Hotel in the area and I only needed it for 3 nights. I only need a one bedroom for one person. They agreed to give me an upgraded room for the same price as a one bedroom, so I thought great! When I got to the room it was a two bedroom, and there was a terrible odor in it, and the room was very cold. I turned on the heater, but after an hour it never got warm at all, it just blew cold air. I called the phone number on the card and nobody answered so I called a couple more times double checking that I got the number right. No answer. It is already 2 in the morning so I decided to just tough it out. At 8 in the morning I go to take a shower and there's no hot water either. I called the front desk and they said they were sending a maintenance person who never showed up. At 11 o'clock I went down to the desk to tell them what happened and they said they would change my room. I asked what they plan to do about the prior night's inconvenience. The lady at the desk said that she was the owner and manager and that since I had two rooms for only the price of one that I should feel lucky. I told the lady that I could have 100 rooms but it's still miserable if they're cold and have no hot water either. The owner said that she didn't even turn her heat on in her place overnight and I have nothing to complain about because there were two beds with sheets on them I could have gotten under. I didn't mention to her that it was a little unsettling when there were three police officers on top of a guy in the parking lot or that there was a crowd of people having a party in the back of the complex. I wasn't looking for anything major from her I just thought she might at least apologize and offer a small credit towards the bill. Instead she insulted me and told me that I dialed the wrong phone number to get help and that I was lucky to have a place to sleep. This could very well be the worst hotel experience I've ever had.  Do yourself a favor, be safe, be treated with at least a little respect, and pay a couple more dollars to stay somewhere else. I know I will!

This place is great for ambiance food and service. The adovada is hot but wonderful and the chocolate bread pudding is amazing. Its a dark cave on the inside and waterfalls on the outside... wonderful for a date or a family gathering. Just make sure you like food a little spicy :). Would have been full 5 stars, but the price is a hair high for what you get. However, the place is always busy, so I guess it may be priced right for the area....

This place came recommended by a friend. I went and was not impressed by the parking lot....double checked to make sure my doors were locked. Went in- nice little place, great beer selection in the cooler. Ordered the little Joe coconut coffee stout made on-site. SO GOOD ordered another. We had the Margarita Pizza and the Caprese Crisp to boot. Both were excellent brew-pub style food. Good food, good beer, good friends, good times etc. The wait for the food was a bit long but the beer was right on time and lets face it.......my priority was the beer at that point. I'll be going back for sure. Would have given it a 5th star if the service on the food was faster. Wait staff was very knowledgeable too.

I've been going here since I was a kid.....um a while ago. They are the lease expensive place to go for glasses by far, they take there time with you and their selection is always great.  You sometimes have to wait since they are very popular, but they are popular for great reasons. I don't go anywhere else.....its the very best bang for your buck for something noone wants to have to have.

I have been taking my cars to Pete for 15+ years. He's always been great to work with and does a great job with the repairs and is always more than fair with the price. More importantly,  he stands by his work. I had a paint job fail after 2 years due to defective clear coat. I showed it to him and he insisted on taking the car back to repaint free of charge and had it back to me in  a week- no questions asked. Nothing in this world is perfect all of the time, what really matters is integrity. He proved to me he has it by standing by his work and earned my business and referrals.

I was refereed to Dr. Tricoli by a friend when my regular dentist moved too far away. I couldn't imagine finding a better dentist now. He doesn't try to push anything that isn't needed, I've never had to wait past my appointment time and now he is the dentist for all of my family and several other friends.

Just as everyone has said. Great place for kids and adults. If you order wings you MUST get the smoked ones. They are great! Wait staff was very attentive and we were seated quickly even though we had 19 people in our party.

Best burgers in town and reasonably priced! Good service too. Try the Know Poblano Burger.....Its wonderful! Be ready to wait though, the place is not huge, but has a lot of people who love it. I've been sat right away and been waiting 45 minutes depending on what time you go.

Not sure why there are so many rough reviews on here... I waited in line, but it went quickly. I waited for my food, but it was less than 10 minutes. Everything came out exactly as I ordered it. The burgers were GREAT....The price was a little high, but it was a big step up from any of the fast food burgers too. We had a pretty big order with no mistakes, so I'm wondering if they are improving since the dates of the prior reviews. I've even gone back a couple of time with other family members who came to town and it's been the same. Hopefully I don't ever have the experiences the other folks who downrated the place have had....

OK went back and boy did they drop the ball. We waited 20 minutes for the food and there was hardly anyone there. They got the order wrong. The only thing I can say for them this time is that they were friendly and nice at the counter. What a bummer, I was really looking forward to going back there too :(

Yummy! I had the Dirty Burger. Great chili and the burger was tasty all by itself. NO WAY you can eat this beauty without a fork. They also have a nice selection of Mexican Coke in bottles and Cactus Cooler which I can't seem to find anywhere. Definitely the least pretentious place around here and very friendly owner and staff. I don't know what stick went up someones rear with the negative reviews, but I noticed that they are mostly people that have few reviews and friends so I question their voracity. Either way, give it a shot, it's great backyard BBQ food in a cute little place by nice folks. Give it a shot. Also, BTW they have free WIFI, Thrifty Ice cream and a nice candy collection for the kidos!

OK so they opened and I have someone very close to me that is VERY addicted to things like escamochas and raspados and such. I get roped into going and I can't believe how much I fell in love with this place. I get the fire cheetos with nacho cheese and the tostitos with Chicharon and Pepihuates....All really good. My kids love the ice cream and I have to say that is not regular ice cream. The cotton candy in particular is very good. Everything appears to be very fresh there and we met the owner. She seems really nice too. I'm really happy to have a great place like this so close to where I live so I don't have to drive really far into Phoenix.
