Great little place to unwind for a staycation and have a great time!!! LOVED IT HERE!!! I will definitely be coming back soon!! Only place in all of Scottsdale that doesn't charge you for Cabana use!!! Lots of places to hang out by the pool free of charge! Great room options all differently decorated! Covered FREE parking too! The staff is also exceptional!! Can't wait to go back! :)

It crowded, super dirty, girls bathrooms SUCK, expensive drinks (quality doesn't match price) and not a well mixed crowd (not very much ethnic variety & lots of ratchet & average guys).  For $10 to get in it needs to be better!  It's too bad because SOR (School of Rock) used to be THE place to go to on Mill  but not anymore.  They should close down and COMPLETELY remodel and revamp the place.  SOR was Hot Hot Hot a few yrs ago but the last 2 yrs its really gone down hill.  It was sooo much better when it was Cherry Lounge or even The Level!  Sorry SOR, step your game up and I'll happily come back!

I love everything about Jane!  She really thinks outside the box when it comes to helping me.  She never gives me that "And how does that make you feel" typical therapy answer.  She is always invested in helping to me become better.  She has definetely been there for me many times in my times of need.

Love the drinks at Hi Fi!  Consistently great and nicely priced for the area.  Not usually a very long line on weekends or long wait for a bartender to get to you.  Music is pretty good too!   Nice mix of EDM and hip hop music. :)
