Love me some Qwik Chinese. Gary and his wife are beyond warming. We want to Gary's new location on via Linda because my father in law was in intensive care on 90th street. Gary and his staff were so nice, asking how he was every time we went in there. Coming from the east coast, this is bar none the best Chinese food in AZ.

I was a walk in, they were not busy at all and they sat me with the new guy in "training."  Not sure why you want to put a walk-in with someone in training, but they did.  He totally made my nails thick - for a full set with natural nail color, its $25.  To add gelish on top, it was an additional $20!  He never disclosed the upcharge and I paid $45 for bumpy and thick nails.  When I got home, I had to file them down, smooth them out, then add gelish to them again (since I own gelish at home and know $20 is a rip-off! - an entire bottle costs $18).    Since the appointment lasted 1 hour and 30 mins and the ladies doing pedicures were obviously noticing the inexperienced man's flaws, I decided to pay and just leave - I called later to provide feedback and that I will not be returning again although I have been going there on & off  for about 4 years now and the manager didnt take my call.  I told the person on the phone about my experience and she translated to the manager who didnt seem concerned.    Horrible service from inexperienced nail tech - this place has gone down hill over the years and newer salons are worth the slightly added cost.

Went there this morning and our waitress was Kathy.  My husband ordered steak and eggs medium rare. Our order came and his steak was well done.  I noticed the girl at the other table had a long, thin steak and it was medium rare although she ordered well done. Both tables sent back the steaks (after our waitress confirmed our order as if we said it wrong) and moments later new steaks came out, only they were the same ones delivered to the correct tables, meaning my husband got the other girl's steak. As Kathy placed the steak down, she said the chefs cut into the side (over a 2 inch cut) to confirm the temp. My husband and I both looked at each other in shock!  This is a health code violation to place food on a table, then reserve it to someone else. Our waitress kept eyeing us because she knew we knew what she did and after she asked if anything was wrong, she argued that both steaks were in the window. We said we don't want it and she said I'll remake it.   Needless to say, we are beyond shocked with the professionalism of our waitress and the level of service this place conducts. I would seriously think twice before going here ... You might get someone else's leftovers.

Tommy V's never disappoints. Linguini with clams and red sauce (ask for the red over the white) is a must. Beef carpaccio is amazing!  Great date night.
