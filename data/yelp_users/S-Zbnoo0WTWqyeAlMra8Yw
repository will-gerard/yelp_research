We have 5 dogs and have been using Deer Creek for vet services, as well as grooming, for over a year now.  They are always helpful and answer all of our questions.  They also have boarding and day care.  If there were ever I time I needed those services, I would feel almost as comfortable letting my fur babies stay there as I would with one of my relatives.  The staff is caring and does a great job.

Shogun is one of my favorite spots to grab a few rolls.  It is the only place in the valley that I have found that serves Wahoo (otherwise known as Ono).  The spicy Wahoo roll, the Wahoo sashimi and the Sunset roll are two of my absolute favorites.  I have been stopping by for years and it is consistently good.  I have a lot of friends that are fans of the Godzilla tails too.  Oh, the tempura onion rings are the best onion rings I have ever had!  I will continue visiting this favorite little spot.

This is our favorite spot to catch a movie.  There is a theater closer, but the seats are awful!  Harkins has good seats and always has the movies we want to see!

The Keg is a great spot to have a nice dinner.  We enjoy it because we can get a great dinner in a somewhat casual setting.  The baked garlic shrimp are delicious and so is their French onion soup.  The steaks are usually cooked perfectly, and if for some reason they aren't, they are quick to make it right!

The Pizza Blanco rocks my world!  I crave it!!!  THere is something special about the delicious ricotta with the other flavors.  I don't like it with spinach, but go for the tomato instead and have them add fresh basil.  SO delicious!  The salads are also great and the service has always been good.

This is one of my favorite places to grab Mexican food.  The food is good and it is fun to see the ducks and turtles!

BJ's is a great spot to grab a bite or even catch a game.  The parmesan crusted chicken is so yummy and they brew their own root beer!

I have been a Chompie's fan for many years!  Whether I am stopping in to pick up a bialy and an iced tea or sitting down to grab a sandwich in the restaurant.  The triple deckers are awesome!  I can't get a Rueben anywhere else because they are never even close to as good as Chompie's!  Service in the restaurant can be hit or miss.  We have had the best service, and other times it left more to be desired, but it has never been bad.  Definitely suggest stopping by the bakery and grabbing a dessert to take home for later!

This is a favorite spot to grab a yummy pizza!  The pizzas are great and so is the service.  The strawberry gorgonzola salad is delicious and you can't resist their Pizza cookie hot out of the oven!

Oh, Pita Jungle!  Dining in or carry out, I have never been dissatisfied!  It is so wonderful to find a quick, inexpensive, healthy meal, especially when pressed for time and needing to call in an order to be picked up.  The chicken Philly pita with a side of tzaziki rocks my world!

EDIT:  REFER TO UPDATED REVIEW !!!  I absolutely love Verde Maison!  One of the reasons I first began shopping here was due to the largest selection of Jane Iredale products in the valley.  It is the only makeup that I use, or will use, and I am a licensed aesthetician (although not practicing).  I have found that I originally only purchased cosmetics, but have found wonderful bath bombs, soaps, and other goodies that I absolutely love here.  I haven't experienced spa services, but imagine it would be great too.  The owner is almost always there and couldn't be any nicer or more accommodating.  Definitely sign up for her newsletters.  I have gotten some really great deals with her sales!  Happy to have a spot like this close to home.

After reading such amazing reviews, I decided to bring two of my fur babies here to have them groomed.  I dropped them off and came back later to pick them up when I was told.  The man, who I believe is the owner, reeked of cigarettes or had been smoking inside of the shop!  My dogs were shaking and scared.  He only groomed ONE of my dogs and told me that he couldn't do the other because he was afraid he would bite him.  What?  He has been groomed for years at other establishments and there has never been an issue with either one!  BTW, we are talking about a 4 lb Toy Poodle and a 12 lb Papillon mix.  The owner suggested I bring him back to be groomed by another groomer in his shop that was better with working on difficult animals.  What a waste of time and money!  Needless to say, I wouldn't dare bring my babies back to this place and found a great place that is friendly, does a great job, and my dogs and I are happy when I pick them up!  Highly suggest going somewhere else.

Oh, how I love gelato!  This 'spot' really does it right.  What a nice treat!

While it wasn't 'bad', there are far better places to have an enjoyable meal in the area, even if you want to catch a game.  We went once.  We saw.  We haven't been back.

I love True Foods!  Whether we are having an appetizer with drinks or enjoying a meal, the experience is always wonderful.  The organic tomato and kale pizza is SO yummy!  I love to sit on the patio next to the fountains on a nice night.

We love Grimaldi's!  One of the best pizzas around and the service has always been great too.  From time to time, I also enjoy a salad when here.  We have never been disappointed.

I had a really nice experience at 101 Hair & Nails.  I received a manicure and  pedicure by Tricia.  She is friendly, very nice, and quite knowledgeable.  She has been doing nails a very long time and it shows.  I especially love my Rockstar toes and can't wait to go back for more!
