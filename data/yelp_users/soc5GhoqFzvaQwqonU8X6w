Over cooked lobster and very fishy mussels and clams. This is the not the first time we've been let down here. We will not be coming back.

Diamond in the rough. This was our first time to Mark's, it won't be out last. We came for breakfast based on a recommendation we were NOT disappointed at all. The service was friendly and always with a smile. We were invited to sit wherever we liked and immediately were brought water. The eggs were cooked and seasoned perfectly, the most amazing part of breakfast was the pancakes. They were huge, airy and cooked all the way though. They had amazing flavor and really hit the spot. This little cafe in Tempe is a place that should not be missed.

1st time here today. We came in for brunch since our first choice wasn't open yet. We had a FANTASTIC experience. Great service, good hot food, very clean and efficient. Can't wait to come back and try something else.

The first time was great. The second time..not so much and this 3rd and final time SUCKED. Sunnyside Breakfast Lounge is nothing special, honesty Denny's is better. The service was slow, getting excuses from the server, drinks took over 45 minutes to get. Breakfast came out the same time as our drink and it was cold. We've decided that we'll never go back again. They have not only lost a customer, but we'll tell everyone we know how bad it has been consistantly.
