Their sonoran dogs are delicious and only $2.50 apiece! This is the only place I have had them so I don't have much to compare them to but I think they are AMAZING.  I really enjoy their tacos as well, and they are only $1.35 each. I love that they have the salsa bar set up with pickled onions, avocado sauce, sliced limes, and pico. Did I mention pickled onions?!? That is something I am only used to getting at nicer, sit-down restaurants. They really make the tacos.  Glad I don't live super close or I would be here all the time. CASH ONLY!

I love this place. So much.  Ever since Texano's in Tempe closed, Fiesta Burrito has been my go-to place for adobada burritos. A side of sour cream is a necessity with the adobada burrito and they give you a good portion for the price. I also like lots of pico and they have a big container of it inside at the salsa bar.  The machaca plate with egg (#11) is my second favorite. I always use the accompanying tortilla to make my own burrito, plus I get the rice and beans on the side. Yum.  The quesadilla supreme is also very good, but I would recommend eating it with a fork and knife, they really load it up.  Overall, I have never had anything bad from Fiesta and the staff is always super friendly. Plus there's a drive-thru. Awesome!

It pains me to give this place 2 stars because I am in love with their tacos, the sauce they put on them is so delicious.  However, what kind of place with a full service menu starts carding at 5 pm everyday!?! I used to come for Taco Tuesday last year, when I was only 20, and have tacos. Sometimes they started carding kind of early (7 pm-ish) but normally they didn't start until around 8. Still a bit early but not outrageously so. I attempted to bring my friend for tacos last week. Even though I am now 21, she is not. We arrived around 6:30 pm, and were told that we could not enter the establishment because she wasn't 21. The bouncer told us they card at 5 pm everyday (earlier on Sundays) and  we could come back with a parent or guardian. UM, not only are we college students whose parents live out of state, even if they were nearby, what 20 year old would even bother doing that?! It's like being under 13 again and not being able to go to the public pool without your mommy or daddy....it's just ridiculous.  The logic of this policy baffles me...there were young children there with their parents eating dinner. I really just don't get the point of letting 10 year olds in with a parent but not someone who is 20...not like it was prime drinking hour!!  Carding at 8-9 makes sense when it started becoming more bar than restaurant, but if you are going to have a full service menu, it's just stupid.  Since Loco Patron apparently did not want our money, we went across Scottsdale Road to El Hefe and had delicious tacos and guacamole. :) They impressed me there, giving us the happy hour deal on tacos even though we arrived just after HH technically ended. Fabuloso!

Sprinkles has amazing cupcakes! The cake is always moist and the frosting delicious. I have had cupcakes from other bakeries where they pipe the frosting on using a pastry bag, and there is wayyyyyy too much frosting. Sprinkles does it by hand, so the frosting amount is always perfect for the cake size. I love the simple decorations they use as well.  The only downside I have noticed is that they use a lot of oil, and if the cupcake is touching the box the oil will actually seep through the cardboard. But I guess it's the price you pay for extremely moist cupcakes! Also, the frosting is super sweet and it sometimes makes my teeth hurt. It's so worth it though!  My favorite flavor ever is Chai Latte! They only have them on Fridays though, and they often run out before dinner, so get there early if you want one!  They also have amazing seasonal flavors: salty caramel, dark chocolate raspberry, eggnog spice, chocolate peppermint, and the best: brown sugar praline! That one is an Easter flavor and I love the crunch of the praline combined with the brown sugar! YUM!  Yes, it is a bit pricey, but if you like the "Sprinkles Cupcakes" and "Sprinkles Cupcakes Scottsdale" Facebook pages they each do a daily whisper word that will get the first 50 people a free cupcake! I always try to buy another cupcake when I use them, so it's about $2 a cupcake then. Many times the whisper word will get you an off-the-menu cupcake, either a seasonal offering from a different part of the year or a cupcake creation. I had a lemon cake with strawberry frosting once, and it tasted like strawberry lemonade...delicious!

George's has the best gyro meat! It has so much flavor and is very moist. I've had it in a original gyro as well as a daily special called a 'greeksteak' [I believe] that is basically a cheesesteak with gyro meat. Both are awesome! I still need to try the italian style with marinara and mozzerella. The portions are extremely generous, I usually have leftovers unless I am super hungry.  I also really enjoyed the hummus. They serve it with warm pitas, which is a great touch that sets them apart from a lot of other places. Also, the greek salad that you can sub for the fries is fantastic! I'm not a fan of fries with a gyro, too much starch, so it is nice to have another option.  They have a rewards program called Belly. Each time you eat there you scan your card and get 5 points. You can save your points and redeem for different rewards, like a free drink, free meal, or even creating and having a gyro named after you on the menu!

Favorite menu items:  -Pretzels & Fondue (half off on happy hour M-F 3-6) The BEST pretzels I have ever had! -Shaved prime rib dip -Pork belly cubano -Monkey bread  Everything on the menu is yummy though. For a drink I highly recommend the clown punch. The pomegranate foam is so unique and delicious.  The decor here is awesome and service has always been very attentive!

Dinner last night was incredible! And so reasonably priced.  We started off with a small piece of filet and artichoke, compliments of the chef. There was a white sauce with a hint of horseradish on top and the meat was delicious. Then the bread was brought out. It came with whipped butter and a pesto dip which was so yummy. There was several different breads: a pepperoni roll, a wheat, and a slice with what I think were sundried tomatoes. The pepperoni roll was incredible and I am not normally a fan of pepperoni...  For appetizers we ordered the bacon-wrapped dates ($8) and the calamari ($7). The calamari was nice and crispy and the lemon pepper tartar sauce had a little kick to it. However, the clear winner of this round was the dates. They are stuffed with chorizo and a water chestnut, then wrapped in bacon and served with an amazing hoisin dipping sauce. The water chestnut added just the right amount of crunch and the dipping sauce was fantastic. These are a must-order!  Next, the bowl of seafood bisque ($7) I ordered came out. The manager warned me that it was a big bowl of soup but the size still surprised me! It was probably the best seafood bisque I have ever tasted, loaded with chunks of shrimp, scallop and crab that I could actually identify, unlike some that I have ordered in the past. At only $7 it's a steal! I had to box at least half of it up t leave room for my entree.  Next came a mini martini glass with a small scoop of orange sherbet to cleanse our palettes. I am normally more of an ice cream fan, but this was some of the best sherbet ever! I found myself wishing the scoop was just a little big bigger :)  The entrees were brought next. I ordered the filet with prawns ($26) and my friend got the lamb ($22). My filet was cooked perfectly rare and the bearnaise on top was to die for. The prawns sat on some tomato lime coulis which was great. My friend let  me try a piece of lamb and it too was cooked perfectly to medium rare. It had just the right amount of fat in the cut of meat. Our sides included broccolini (also cooked perfectly), au gratin potatoes (yummy), creamed spinach (not as creamy as I am used to but the crunchy topping really elevated it), and lobster mashed potatoes (with chunks of delicious lobster in nearly every bite, $7 upcharge).   At this point I was too stuffed to eat anymore, but my friend ordered the dessert special, a baklava cheesecake ($7). The round cheesecake had the sweet honey glaze on it and crunchy filo and nuts piled on top. I only managed one bite but the contrast of the cheesecake with the crunchy filo was amazing!  Finally, we were brought two small chocolate espresso cubes to finish up. I ate a bit of one and it was creamy and delicious.   All the food we were served was soo delicious and the best part was the price: Just over $100 WITH TIP.  I mean, we basically had an eight course meal for two people, so that is an incredible deal. Plus I was so impressed with the quality of the food. The filet was one of the best I have ever had, the seafood bisque was absolutely loaded with seafood, and I will dream about those dates until I can go back. This is a great gem of a restaurant.

The food here is amazing! All the ingredients are very fresh and high quality and it's a great value for the price paid. The orange chicken is addicting and the beef is so tender and juicy. Why go somewhere else and pay the same price for inferior food?
