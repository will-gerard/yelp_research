I come here often and up until today I was pretty happy with my experience. Today however, I paid $6 for a burger patty. No fries, no bun - just a patty. When I brought it to the attention of the owner (who was cashing me out) she just offered a receipt. O.K - Her English is not that good so I figured she was hiding behind that. I will no longer be eating here since I can make five hamburgers with $6.

Ana is a fabulous piercer and is the ONLY place I would recommend. I got my tongue and nose pierced in the same day by her and she made it so comfortable for me and I hardly any pain at all. She is so good at her job and she loves doing it. She stays on top of the latest information to supply her customers with the best way to treat their new piercings so they heal properly. I have had both my tongue and nose pierced in the past by other people and it just didn't work out. I will never go anywhere else now and I'll only tell my friends and family to use Ana. She is clean, safe and has the best personality! I had no problem with the wait time as I was in and out within 30 minutes, so no complaints there.
