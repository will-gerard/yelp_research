Horrible. Food overpriced, no service, dark dingy atmosphere. The only good thing about it is the location.

I have to wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer. I just literally waited an hour sitting in a dirt field across the street waiting for the Shell to open rather than spend another CENT at this place.  What happened this morning? I walked up to the Shell to pick up a pouch of Bugler tobacco - $3.21 after tax. I brought $3.50 with me. Well, apparently they're closed between 2-4AM for stocking of the store.  So I ventured across the street to the Chevron - NOT my first time there either.  I've been to this place on numerous occasions.  And EVERY time I've bought a scratcher ticket here, I've heard the same nonsense. Clerk: You can only pay cash for scratchers. You cannot pay debit or credit.  Me: I have cash.  Clerk: You can only pay cash.  Me: I only have cash.  Clerk: You cannot pay with debit/credit. Only cash.  Me: I ONLY pay with cash. NEVER with a card. I HAVE CASH!!  Well...back to tonight's straw that broke the camel's back.   Me: What is the cheapest pouch of roll your own tobacco? Clerk: I have Bugler for $4.00 and I have top.  Me: Which is the CHEAPEST you have? Clerk: I have Bugler for $4.00  I don't HAVE 4 bucks on me, and just walked 20 mins to get there (early morning exercise is the BEST btw).   Me: How much for a single cigar.  Clerk: $1.65 Me: Do you have any multipack cigars for $3 or less? Clerk: No, no, no.  Me: What are those packs of Swisher cigars that say "5 for 3"? Clerk: They are $5.99!! Me: But it says "5 for 3".  Clerk: It was the old owners price. I charge $5.99.  Me: But it says "5 for 3". You're charging 5 for $5.99. Maybe you should take that down. It's false advertising.  Clerk: I charge $5.99. That was the OLD price.  Me: That's DOUBLE what is advertised. That's like advertising $3 for a gallon of gas and when I come to pay, you charge me SIX!! Because that was the OLD price.  And, let me state: This bastard (as ALWAYS) gave me attitude from the get go.   I told him that I work hard for my money, and I DON'T have to spend it there. That I could go across the street.  He tells me to go.  I them proceed to tell him that I am the CUSTOMER. I can take my money to any other gas station. What happens if he does that to everyone? You won't have a business. I told him that I proudly served my country for him to be able to move here to live. I told him that I didn't want to ASSUME he wasn't from America, but it was pretty obvious he wasn't (India).  He then try's to scan the cigars to show me what the ring up as.  I told him that I would never spend another CENT here, and would inform everyone I know to do the same. I told him that he could watch my money walk out the door and wait an hour across the street.  And I did.  I encourage YOU to sit in that dirt field too, my friend...

I came here with a buddy of mine around 6:00 in the evening on a Wednesday. Against my wishes, we sat in the dining area instead of the bar.   The booth - WAY TO SMALL. I'm a skinny guy - 6' tall 165ish. I had to sit "side saddle" to feel somewhat comfortable. For those who don't know what that means, I had to sit SIDEWAYS with my legs on the seat, and my feet hanging off the end.   The atmosphere was devoid of life, and completely drained of energy. There were two other tables seated in the section.   The waitress had no idea what beers they offered, and had to read off a list. She also had no clue if they offered any season selections that might of had fruit flavoring of any kind.  When she came back from "investigating", she said they offered a hard apple cider. I ordered one along with an Italian beef. I've worked for a NNY in the past, and thought it to be a safe bet - bread, meat, cheese, au jus, fries. The sandwich could of been taken out of the salamander sooner, as the top had some burning to it.  My friend had boneless wings - I'm not even going to waste time talking about deep fried, frozen commercial "meat chunks".   I don't go out to eat very often, but I do work as a chef. In aware of the difference between a horrible-great place is; I've worked for all in-between.  I knew I was in for low quality food, but for as DEAD as it was, I'd expected to see them at the top of their game.  This was mediocre at best.  At least the hard apple cider was good.

I haven't stopped in for a couple/few years - still as good as I remember! I cook for a living, and I very seldom eat out. This was well worth my hard earned money.  Keep up the good work chefs!!
