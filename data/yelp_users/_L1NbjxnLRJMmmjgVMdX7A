The only thing saving Grapevine is the awesome karaoke DJ James. Service at this place is terrible. I'm usually one to give someone the benefit of the doubt the first time as everyone has off nights.  But, where I draw the line is bartenders on their phones behind the bar and grabbing my beer before I'm finished.  To add to that, the level of service has been consistently bad a few times in a row.  What's worse is that the waitresses and bartenders are never really that busy and always seem to be inconvenienced by patrons who just want another cocktail.  I've drawn the line and will not be returning. I hope you do the same.

So I haven't been to the dentist in over 2 years so naturally I'm a little afraid to walk through those dental doors and meet my fate.  On top of that, I am not looking forward to being lectured about how I don't floss enough or exactly how I need to brush.  But, I needed a good dentist in my area so I made an appointment with Chapparal Dental.  First of all, his staff is amazing.  I had to reschedule my appointment a couple times and Christy was really flexible and always very nice.  His office is clean, with a good selection of magazines and good music to boot.  As far as the actual dental experience goes, Dr. Tricolli is the best dentist I have had.  He was pleasant, funny and incredibly knowledgeable.  He actually walked through my X-Rays with me and explained what was going on in my mouth.  His bedside manner is excellent as well.  He had suggestions as far as my oral hygiene went but never forced anything on me and didn't judge me on the fact that flossing is not necessarily an everyday activity for me.  I actually walked out of his office looking forward to coming back in 6 months.  That doesn't happen often I'm sure.

We've brought our dog in for training and grooming and we couldn't be happier. We took Larry in for obedience training and we gave Tammy the challenge of trying to correct our 10 year olds wayward habits. Needless to say, she is one of the few people (outside of his mother and father) that he likes and she whipped him into shape.  Onto the grooming. Larry sheds like its his business and tends to leave his hairs on everything from our cars to clothes. We take him in every once and awhile to get trimmed and shampooed and it makes a tremendous difference. They really know what they're doing  Tammy and her staff are extremely friendly. As a dog owner it can be nerve racking to leave your canine in the company of someone else. Tammy puts that fear to rest and makes you feel at ease. I trust her with Larry's life. Thanks Tammy.

The atmosphere here is tremendous. You feel at home as soon as you walk through the doors and are welcomed by friendly people who actually know something about coffee.  The coffee? Excellent. Keep in mind, this is not a Starbucks.  Be ready to wait a few minutes for your caffeinated beverage but it's worth the wait.  I haven't tried and of the food yet but there was a quiche brought to a table nearby that looked delicious. I strongly suggest sitting on the patio while you have your coffee. There's lots of comfortable seating.    Overall, this place is my new go to when I want a good cup of coffee. You should try it too.

As we all know, DJ's are paramount when it comes to the success or failure of an event.  Our event was a wedding so we were naturally nervous.  Jermaine was nothing short of amazing on our special day.  There was not a single person who didn't enjoy themselves at our reception.  Most know that about 1/3 of the people at an event will be comfortable to get up and dance at an event.  It's difficult to keep the rest involved and get them to comfortably participate.  Jermaine kept everyone involved from doing little games before dinner to actually getting the wallflowers at our reception out on the dance floor.  Jermaine worked with us every step of the way, even when we dragged our feet and got our playlist to him the night before.  He was spot on with the music and made everyone very comfortable.  He was a huge piece of our wedding/reception going as well as it did and I'd have him back at any future event in a heartbeat!

Strolled in here and ordered a tri-tip sandwich and a beer with my wife.  The Tri-Tip was perfectly smoked.  The bread they put it on was delicious and grilled to perfection. It was served with a side of BBQ but it's almost unnecessary as the meat is flavorful enough.  The service was great and the beer was ice cold.  There's plenty of TV's to watch whatever game is on.  Mill needed a new spot and this place answered the call.
