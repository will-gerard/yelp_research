Great customer service. My food was messed up and the manager remade it and took it off my bill. I'll be back.

The tuna poke is great. Unfortunately it's a dinner item so sometimes they don't have it for lunch.

Very bad customer service. I went to their website and I saw they had a candy that I wanted in stock; so I drove there. Upon getting there, I asked their representative if they had the candy and he told me no. When I told him I saw on the website that they sold it he told me I was probably on the wrong website. After we confirmed I was on the right website, he told me that the company had stopped making the candy. When I told him they hadn't - I buy it all the time,  his site merely advertised them for cheaper he said well something was wrong with the site. Very bad customer service.

This Dunkin' Donuts is horrible. They almost always get my order wrong. The employed always have an attitude. They have the worst customer service ever. This Dunkin donuts needs to be under new management and have extreme customer service training. I've had no less than three bad experiences here.

The Henhouse Cafe has horrible customer service. Terrible management.  At first glance, the place has decent food. However, the lack of customer service and the lack of management skills at this restaurant makes it one that you should skip at all costs.   I used to patronize this place at least weekly, but never again.   I was in a referral group that met there every other week, but management could never remember to put our meeting in the books so the room was never set up for us.  And now, for today's downer. I like my potatoes crispy and my sausage done; after all, it is sausage.   I expressed this to my server stating "I want my sausage well done and my potatoes crispy, like burnt."  My food came to me and the potatoes were not crispy and the sausage was not well done.   The server asked, "is that crispy enough?" I said, "no." And before I could even tell him about my sausage, he took the potatoes away. Five minutes later, with no server interaction in between, my potatoes came back. The server asked, "is everything else, okay?" and I told him about the sausage. He took the plate and walked away, sans comment. Had he waited 2 seconds more, I could have told him that he forgot to bring butter for my pancakes, but he didn't.   5 minutes later, the sausage came back and it was this weird color brown, as if it had been in a deep fryer. I don't desire to die of a heart attack from grease overload, I just don't enjoy eating raw pork. When the server dropped the sausage off, he dropped it as he walked by, so I still did not have a opportunity to say anything about wanting butter.   5 minutes later, he returned and I asked for some butter for my now cold pancake.   He brought the butter.   5 minutes later he dropped off the check and I asked to speak to the manager, and this is where the story gets even worse.   The manager, Bo, was very defensive and repeatedly interrupted me when I tried to tell him about my experience.   For instance, I stated, "I like to eat my food when it's hot and all together." He stated, "well it was all together, you just sent it back."  Me - "Well I want to gauge what should I say to get my potatoes crispy, the way I like them, on the first time?"  Him - "say you want them so burnt they are inedible." Me - "That is rather rude." Him - "Well, I can't tell you what you like but my kitchen did nothing wrong." Me -"Bo, I am just trying to tell you about my poor experience in your restaurant." Him - "No, you are telling me you had a problem with the food, not the experience." Me - "Well, it was a poor experience, the server set the sausage down while rushing by and I couldn't tell him about the other missing items." Him - "No, he didn't.  At that point, I was deflated and frustrated about the experience so I simply paid and left.  I hope whoever reads this does NOT patronize The Henhouse Cafe, located at 3244 E Guadalupe Rd, Gilbert, AZ 85234.

Bad customer service; skimps on serving size.  I visited as I am from the east coast and I remember the Rita's of Philly. However, they skimped on the custard in the gelati and when I commented on it, the worker rudely told me, "I think that's enough." Epic fail. I'll take my $5 to the grocery store.
