I have been going here for at least 25 years!  This place is great!  The service is awesome and the food ALWAYS tastes great.  We have also been to the other locations and experience the same great service and food.  The original location has barely changed at all since I started going there.  Some people might think that is a negative but it brings me back to times past!    Its a must go!!!

So, I headed up to north Phoenix to visit my 88 year old dad.  He is bored because his wife wont retire so they can travel and have fun, but that is a different story.  I needed a excuse to stop at Uncle Sam's and that was it....   I walked in about 1pm and was seated promptly(big word)....    The nice young lady brought me a Diet Coke and a menu.  She returned two more times to refill my drink and then FINALLY asked me when the rest of my party were going to show up.  I told her that I was it....  She then was somewhat embarressed and offered to buy me a beer or something, so I excepted the free Diet Coke.    I really came to Uncle Sam's to have a Meatball Sub but this time and the first time ever I ordered a pizza.    I waited................. and then she brought out a personal pizza for me....O-M-G!!!!!!     Now I know why people love this place!   It was incredible!!!!!    I cant even desribe it....  just perfect....  flavor was A-W-E-S-O-M-E....           so much so that I have been back one more time since then to have another.!!!!!!!      BTW-- I think they have some good beer specials also.... BUT go for the pizza and enjoy..

The Peppersauce is reopened with new owners.  My wife and I stopped for lunch there today.  The inside has been painted and some things are moved around but basically it looks the same.  Only cleaner!  Not that is was dirty before but it was worn and needed fresh paint and spiffed up.    I had the Bbq beef sandwich with coleslaw.  My wife had Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The flavor was really good on both meals.  The service was excellent.    We will be returning for sure!   Give it a try, you wont regret it..........

My wife and I eat here frequently and the quality has gone down lately.  I had the Meatloaf and it was not so good.  That visit was a couple of weeks ago.  This last week we stopped for lunch and I ordered a burger.  The patty tasted like the frozen ones you buy at Safeway.  Really??  Come on guys, put some effort into it.  It was tough and tasted like it had been frozen.     Peppersauce could be a great place but it seems like they are cutting corners......

We rode the Harley last weekend to Casa Grande to have a look around.  There is not a lot of selection for breakfast so we ended up at Dennys.  What a surprise we were in for!  The place was clean, the service was truly amazing!, the food was very good.  If you read my reviews you know that I am picky when it comes to eating out.    They did a great job and we will be back!

For the people who write reviews on this place and say its a tourist trap...  DUH!!!!     I have been going here on and off since I was a little kid in the early 70's...  The steaks are always great!!  I have never had a bad meal here and I dont know of anyone who has.  You will not be disappointed coming here.  Dont bother to call for a reservation because they have 3000 seats.

We were out in Tempe today so I planned a swing by Ted's for lunch.  I have driven by it for 20 years and never stopped before.    We arrived with only 2-3 people ahead of us in line.  Our order was promptly taken and our food was on the grill in no time.  We then proceeded to order fries and onion rings.  This was sort of overkill since the portions are quite large.    I ordered a regular burger and it was tasty but the patty was thin.  My wife had the foot long hotdog and couldn't finish it all.  The place is clean and the walls are covered with awards from years past.    Overall:  Great service, Good quality food, Clean and well kept dining area, Good value for the money.  I am sure that the owners opened a location in Tempe so they could visit in the winter time and write off the trip as a business trip..

So, its Friday night and we decide to drive 40 miles to try Lone Star.  I asked my daughter to call and see if she can get us a reservation since I hate to wait.  She made the call and was told that we didnt need a reservation and "they would take care of us when we got there".  Okay?   When we walked in to the Lone Star there was 3 or 4 couples waiting to be seated and I was told it would be 15 minutes.  I asked if they accepted reservations and was told "only for 6 or more people".  How nice.    We were seated about 15 minutes later and promptly waited on.  The server had no expression, no personality, no nothing....  Like a robot.    Our food was average and best and very salty.  It was nothing special and the bill was about $75.00 for two adults and two teenage girls.     We will not be returning....

WOW!!!  --  We just returned from lunch at Thee Pitts.  We arrived around 11:15 and must have beaten the lunch rush.  The place was almost empty and we were seating as soon as we walked in.  The service was prompt and friendly.    I ordered the Brisket Sandwich with a salad.  The salad was brought out very quickly and I was surprised that it was a full size salad.  It was fresh and tasty.    My wife ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich with Coleslaw.    Our lunch order was in front of us in about 15 minutes.  The protions were big.  The Sandwiches were about 3-4 inches thick, served on fresh rolls.  The sandwiches were covered in bbq sauce but not drowning in it.  You could always add more if you like.  We thought the flavor was very good!  Lunch was a little pricey but worth it.    We have been to many different places for lunch and sometimes leave feeling like we didnt get our monies worth or that the expreience could have been better.  We did not feel that way when we left The Pitts.  Our lunch tab was about $25.00 for two people.

We made a stop here yesterday.  We took our seats at the bar and the bartender was very busy watching soccer on TV.  There were dirty dishes all over the bar.  The a/c was very cold so we moved to the other end of the bar which was much better.    I ordered a beer and my lovely wife had ice tea while we munched on chips that had good flavor.  I looked over the menu and was surprised to see most of the appetizers were priced in the $9-$12 range.    We decided to split the Chicken Quesadilla.  The bartender asked if I would like Sour Cream and Guacamole with it and I responded "yes": The plate came out in about 10 minutes.  The Quesadilla was one flour tortilla folded in half.  That to me is really a half of a Quesadilla not a full one.  Especially for $8.99.  The flavor was okay, nothing special.    We finished eating and asked for the bill.  That was after the bartender pulled himself away from the TV.  I took a look at it and was shocked.  We ordered one draft beer, one ice tea and one Chicken Quesadilla and the bill was $22.89!!!!!    I then realized that the adding Sour Cream and Guacamole added $1.49 and $2.49 respectively.  That is the way they make a $8.99 appetizer turn into a $12.99 appetizer.    I was not impressed with the food of the cleanliness or the service here.    We will not go back here or to the new location in Goodyear when it opens.

Bill Johnson's has been in the valley forever.  I think its time for them to go.  My wife and I have tried it twice and both times it has been horrible.  The service is bad.  The waitress was rude, slow and needed work on personal hygene.  The food was not very good.  I ordered a hamburger and fries.  The burger was very dry like it had been under a heat lamp for a long time and the fries were pretty much the same way.  I still cant figure out why whenever I drive past this place the parking lot is full.

We took our daughters here to celebrate a birthday last week and it was A-W-E-S-O-M-E....        Great Food  Great Service  Great Experience  If you would like to have a great meal at someplace besides a chain restaurant this is this worth a visit!

I am a HUGE fan!  I spend a ton of money here each year.  Thats what happens when you have teenagers with cars and numerous other "toys".    The staff always take their time to make sure you have a great experience.  They pass out free water and greet you with a smile.  If they are busy, you can leave your car and return later to pick it up.    I sent my wife in recently with her company car and they fixed a flat for free and even rotated the tires on my truck even though the tires were not purchased there because its new.    These guys are a class act!

We made a trip to First Watch on the way to the airport to take our daughter so she could catch a flight to Texas.  I know what you are thinking..."why would anyone want to go to Texas on purpose?".  She really does have a good reason, so off we went.  We walked in and they seated us right away.  Our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink order.  She introduced herself as "Lindsay", and I am sure she is not the "Milkoholic Lindsay" from the E-Trade commercial.  She did a great job for us.  Our food came out quickly and it was quite tasty.  Lindsay checked on us quite a few times as we ate and refreshed our drinks.   We will be returning for another visit.     The valley needs more places that have a good to great breakfast...!

Never again!   My wife talked me into trying it while we were getting the oil changed and the truck washed across the street.  I told her that I had a bad feeling about it before we walked in.    So, in we walked and sat in a booth.  I started for the buffet and grabbed a plate.  The under side of the plate was not clean.  It had a gritty feeling like it was not totally clean but I tried to put that aside and just keep a open mind.    The buffet was lacking in a lot of ways.  I was not impressed but did not say anything to my wife.  She went to the buffet and returned with a plate full of food.  I took a bite of the Broccoli and Beef and it had a "different taste" but I didnt say anythng.   I decided right then that I would not be returning for anymore food and that I really wanted to go somewhere else for lunch.  My wife told me a few minutes later that she was sorry for making go here for lunch.  The food was horrible!!!!!  It was a really bad experience.    I returned to the office and made a frozen dinner to eat which was MUCH BETTER than lunch at the Bamboo Buffet.     Yuck!!!    I will never return again!!!

We have been to Raul & Theresa's a few times.  Let me start by saying that my wife is hispanic and has spent alot of time in Mexico eating authentic Mexican food.  We are not impressed.  The decor is old and not very clean.  The whole place smells like cooking oil and so will your clothes when you leave.  The food is over spiced and still not very tasty.  I dont think we will be returning.

I made my second trip to Matt's this week.  I took my wife for breakfast once before.  We waited for about a half a hour but the experience was very good.  So, I found myself downtown with my daughter who was signing up in the Army National Guard to be a Air Traffic Controller.  I left her at the Military Entrance Processing Station on 1st and Washington at 0530.  With alot of free time on my hands I decided to walk to Matt's.  I arrived just after it opened and there were about 8-10 people already inside waiting for their food.  I sat down and was served almost right away.  I ordered eggs and sausage along with wheat toast.  I then called my wife, who was getting the rest of the girls ready for school, to tell her I was at Matt's.  She was not happy!  Oh well......     The food was great!  The service was great!!!  My total bill was $12.50 including tip.   I then proceeded to walk back to meet my daughter and spent the rest of the day waiting for her to finish her paperwork.  She leaves on June 1st and I am very proud of her!

We decided that we would take in another great breakfast this Saturday at Matt's.  The food again was awesome that is not my beef.  We arrived at 0600 and our course there was no one else there since they still didnt open until 0630.  The employees were busy getting ready for the day.  Meanwhile some other customers started showing up and it seemed that a few of them knew each other so they must be regulars there.    The door opened and 0630 and a young blond lady invited us in with the others that were waiting.  This is were it happened!   I walked in the door and chose a table to the right and was informed that "that table is set for three".   WTF??    We were the first people in the door and anyone who has ever eaten knows that it is open seating and if seats are not available then you put your name on a notebook sheet of paper by the door and wait.  So, we sat down and watched three "men"  cruise over to the table "set for three"....   I guess that they get prefered seating over other customers.   I know it sounds petty but the tone of little blondy completely pissed me off.......  I dont think it was right and I think her tone was rude and you could tell she really didnt care what we thought about it..  I will think again before returning to eat here.   There are a lot of choices alot closer to home for breakfast.

We took all 4 girls to Dick's for lunch yesterday.  We had a little trouble finding it.   Dick's is very small and was quite busy.  We were lucky and they sat us at the bar without waiting.     This was our first visit and we really had no idea what to expect.  I did read the reviews and took a look at the menu so we thought it would be a good fit for us.    The server brought us menus and took our drink order.  We noticed that the cooking was taking place right in front of us at the bar.  The area is very small but they seemed to make it work.  We couldnt believe how large the servings were that the cooks were preparing.  We ordered and our food came to us about 15 minutes later.  It was VERY good to say the least.    The atmosphere was great.  The food was great.  It is a little pricey but worth it.  The best way to sum it up is that my wife said "if this place was closer to home we would eat here alot".

We  have been back to Dick's twice recently.  We went both times for breakfast.  Both times were amazing.  The first time I had the green chile meatloaf and eggs.  The second time I had scrambled eggs.  Huge portions and excellent taste.  The service on both visits were perfect.  We will be back again soon.    Do yourself a favor and try it out.  You wont be sorry.

I took my wife and the girls last night to happy hour at Buffalo Wild Wings. The place was very crowded and loud.  The waitress was not that friendly and started by asking for my i.d. along with my wife's.  I find this somewhat irritating since I am in my mid forties and it is obvious that I am not under age.  We service was good but not exceptional and it matched the food.  Nothing special!  I think if you look around you can find a better deal with better quality food.

Is it just me or does this place smell???   We stopped for a pitcher (or 2) the other day.  We sat in the bar and the service was pretty good.  The beer seemed flat.  The food always seems like it was frozen and just warmed up in the microwave.  I think they need to revamp this place if they plan on competing with the new places that are opening around it.   Good Luck!

This place left me asking what I got for my money.  I took my wife and two of the girls.  The place was clean but the staff was not very friendly.  We spent about $30 for four of us to eat dinner on stryrofoam plates.  The quality of the food was ok but nothing special.  I am sure that we will not return.  I am sure with the economy the way it is that we can do better than this!

I took the wife and kids here for happy hour/dinner.  We experienced friendly, great service.  They brought us a huge bucket of chips that I couldn't even finish.  The rest of the food was tasty and portions were large.    Not a bad place to stop for a snack and a beer.

I make a trip to Food City on occasion for mexican spices that cant be found other places.  I also buy birthday cakes and some other stuff that is way cheaper than other stores.  I do get some strange looks being the only white guy in the place but I am ok with it.  The store is clean and the workers seem helpful when needed.

A stop a BevMo will get you all the drinks and related items you need for a barbeque or party or just drinking at home.  The employees at this location are very helpful and courteous.  This is like the Costco of liquor stores.  Enjoy.

I just stopped at BevMo to purchase a few items.  They carded me!  I asked why and he stated that they have a policy of carding anyone that looks under 50!   That is a stupid policy and I have a policy of not spending money at places with stupid policies.    Bye bye!

So, I ran out of gift ideas for Christmas.  I found myself at Fry's at the gift card section.  I decided to buy my wife a couple of gift cards (cheaper than jewelry).  I picked up a Carrabas and one to BJ's since we had never been there.  Our friends did tell us that they liked it so I thought, why not.    We stopped in for lunch yesterday and sat at the bar.  We were greeted as soon as we sat down by the bartender who took his time to go over the menu and the beer selections.  We did sample a few different beers and they were good.  The menu is very complete and looked good.  We decided to try a sampler plate and a couple of side salads.  The food was fresh and prepared perfectly.    I am sure we will return again.   It was a great experience and total cost for "lunch" and "some" adult beverages was under $40.00

We made a stop here after seeing "Shutter Island".  Great movie, not a great experience here.  When we walked in and sat at a table in the bar we were promptly greeted by the bartender and placed our order.  She returned quickly with our pitcher of beer ($8.00).  The music was playing and the atmosphere was nice.  Not to loud to talk and sports on the big screen.  I figured this might be a nice place to hang out.    Well, it went down hill from there.  My lovely wife decided that we should split a sampler platter so we did.  Our food came out within about 10 minutes.  The "platter" was a small basket containing the following: 3 onion rings, 3 mozzarella sticks, 3 potato skins and 3 stuffed peppers.  The quality was on the order of the freezer section at frys......    The price on this was $11.99!   Now, I could be a little more understanding if it was $5.99.....  So....   We ate and worked on drinking our pitcher as it started to rain.  I then made a visit to the bathroom which was filthy and without paper towels.   I returned to my seat in the bar and watched the platinum blond, that appears to be known by most of the customers, as she tried to find someone that might be willing to take her home for the night.    I guess my opinion would be that this place is not worth a return visit.    I am certain that we can find a better place to spend our money in the future!

I think it may be possible that we are eating out too much!--  With that being said.  I called and made a reservation for 7pm on Saturday night.  We showed up to a crowded waiting area and checked in with the hostess.  She proceeded to hand me a pager.  I thought to myself "Wth? I thought we had a reservation?".  We sat down and waited about 3 minutes and we were them promptly seated in a booth.    I think the booth makes a big difference here because the tables are very close together.  The tables are so close that I feel like I am having dinner with the people at the next table.  Anyway, the booth is super nice.   Roxanne was our server.  She was polite and friendly.  We decided to try the two dinners for $39.95.  We started with soups and they were very tasty.  We then had Chicken Lettuce Wraps which were also good.  I forgot to mention my wife had a white wine spritzer and I had a beer(both good).  The main course was Sweet and Sour Pork and Mongolian Beef and they were both excellent.  Our experience here was near perfect!   We had a great meal with two drinks and our tab was $60.00 including tip......

We made a trip to the Auld Dubliner after the movies a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived about 10 pm and the place was crowded.  They had a live band and it was so loud that I couldnt hear anything!  We sat down and ordered drinks and waited about ten minutes for them.  After that we ordered off the limited late menu and I had the Corned Beef Sandwich and it was one of the worst meals I have ever had.  The texture and flavor were horrible.  My wife had wings and was not impressed.  The prices were very high for what you received.    We will not be making a return trip here.

I went to this location and ordered steak and lobster after having a great meal at Red Lobster in Southern California.  This trip was not so good.  The lobster was tough but I managed to chew thru it.  The worst part was when I made it to the steak and found a hair on it!!!!   Grossed me out!   NEVER AGAIN!

I went to Majerle's for happy hour with my buddies about 6 months ago.  The beer was cold and I ordered the nachos.  They tasted "different" but I didnt think much about it until about an hour later.   I ended up puking my insides out for the next two days.  Needless to say I still cant eat nachos anywhere......       I think I will not be returning...

We decided to try Garden Pizza for lunch today.  My wife and daughter and I each had two slices of Peperoni and a pitcher of beer.  The pizza was good especially the crust which was crisp but not over cooked.  The beer was cold and served with chilled mugs.  I noticed some subs that were being prepared and they looked very good.  My only complaint would be that when we ariived there were two or three tables had not been cleaned up and the dirty plates were just sitting there.

My and I have been to Augie's twice in the last week.  The first time we tried it for lunch and had the following results:  I ordered a meatball sub and it was good but was short on flavor.  My lovely wife ordered a hot dog with onion rings.  She said the dog was good and I sampled the onion rings and they were great!  The only bad thing was that we sat at the pub tables in the bar area and they are too small for lunch.  The second visit was on Friday night for happy hour and here are the results:  We arrived around 6pm and the place was full of people.  We sat at the bar and the service was very good.  I ordered Southwest Eggrolls and my wife had Buffalo Wings.  They were both great.  The manager stopped and talked to us and mentioned that he had seen us earlier in the week for lunch.  We rated our visit very highly and will return soon!

We have made numerous visits to Augie's in the last couple of months.  Each time we stop the service is great along with the food.  Today was another visit for happy hour.  Upon arrival we sat at the bar and the bartender had our drinks in front of us with in 3 minutes.    The lady next to me had just ordered the Border Burger and it looked super tasty, so we decided to split it.  I can honestly say it is one of the best burgers I have ever had.  It is a half pound burger with cheese and guacamole with onion, banana pepper, lettuce and maybe a little cilantro!   The burger came with onion rings which could be even better than before.    So, we ate and the bar started to empty out a little bit.  The manager stopped by to say "hi" and thank us for stopping in.  We always feel welcome and like we belong there whenever we visit.     One other observation is that all the employees seen to work as a team.  We noticed the bar manager taking food out to the people on the patio.  The manager was involved in the kitchen area and also serving food.  Everyone was making sure that the customers were happy.     Overall another great experience!

My friends read my review of Augie's and didn't not feel the same way and asked me to try it again except not at happy hour.  We returned and sat at the bar on a Saturday afternoon about 5pm.  The place was very busy.  The manager noticed us but said very little.  We placed our order of: One Border Burger and Chicken Tender Appetizer with two beers.  The burger came out and was terrible and cold.  The chicken came out and was four pieces of average sized chicken for $9.95!  So, we ate and each had another beer.  When the bill came I was not very happy!    It was very close to $50!        Now, I can see what my friends were talking about......     Too expensive for what you get!   Next time we will try the 2 for $20 special at TGI Fridays.....

I am not sure where to start......  After meeting some friends for a bbq my wife suggested that we stop for a few drinks at Augie's.    We arrived about 8:15 and the place was pretty busy.  We found a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of beers and cheese sticks.  I guess they didnt hear our order because we received Pretzels and cheese instead.  Not a big deal but WTF....    They had music playing and a customer who looked somewhat like Jabba the Hut (seriously) wasnt satisfied with the volume turned it up many times and the staff kept turning it down.  This was happening while many families were there trying to enjoy there meals.  This bar came complete with a overweight drunk girl that was making her way around the bar and kissing multiple guys and trying to jam her tongue as far down their throat as possible.  She apparently was friends with the young female bartender who continued to watch her and give her shots.  I guess I expect this at other places such as Roman's Oasis but what a treat to see this while enjoying a few beers and Pretzels.    Dont stop reading......  We are just getting to the good part.     I noticed a drunk young guy sitting at the end of the bar.  He had a baseball cap on and his face was very red.  His eyes were closed from time to time while he was waiting for his friends to return.  I could tell he was trashed...  I told my wife to take and look and sure enough when she did, he threw up a little bit on the bar and his hand.  He cleaned it up a bit but just sat there.   I told both the bartenders and they did NOTHING....   A few minuted later he had major projectile vomit at the bar.    I told the manager (who apparently couldnt see what we were watcing) and he went to talk to the customer.  The manager asked him to leave but I guess in not a very forceful way because the customer finished his beer and then left.     The end of our incredible visit was capped off by the following event.  The bartender came and told me that "the guy at the end of the bar wants to buy you a drink".  I asked "does he want to buy me a drink or my wife?".  She stated that he wanted to buy us both a drink.  I told her "no thank you".  My wife went to the restroom shortly after this and "the guy at the end of the bar" followed her.  He returned before she did and came over to talk to me.  He explained that he was a regular at the bar and continued talking to me about a bunch of nonsense and soon I just ignored him until he left.  I am confused why a self proclaimed college student would want to buy us drinks.   This place needs help...   I am not sure the owner knows this is going on.  If the owner is the manager I spoke to, then he is in way over his head.     It will not survive.....  If it does, it wont be from me spending money there.

Lunch today with the lovely wife at Smashburger.  The service was good.  We both had burgers and we split onion rings (or whatever they call them) and fries.  I had the Smashburger fries and they were ok but could have been better.  The are seasoned and have olive oil on them which is ok but there was a bit much for my liking.  The burgers were good and we sat out side which was pretty nice.  We will be returning.    The bill:   Two 1/3 pound burgers, one order of fries and onion rings and two sodas.  $19.00.  They also have a decent selection of bottled beers.  Almost forgot to mention that!

I stop for lunch here 2-3 times per month.  I order one slice of pizza, a salad and a diet coke for $4.77.  The pizza is always good, hot and served quickly.  The salad is fresh but they do kinda short ya on the amount of dressing they give you.    I dont think you can find a better place to grab a quick bite to eat for less than $5.  You could always try Taco Bell but does anyone really know what the meat is there anyway........

What can I say about Taste of Italy?   Good food, good service, friendly staff and always clean.  The girls love to come here and have pizza and wings.  The prices are reasonable and the food is very consistent.  They have pitchers of beer and wine is also available.    I also noticed that they now have delivery which tells me that the new Papa John's in Estrella is probably giving them some competition.  I vote to keep my money local and support the locals when I can.    Stop for a visit and I think you will be happy you did!

I was sitting at my desk today bored to death.  I began to think "what should I have for lunch today?".  I am completely burnt out on fast food, burgers etc.   At that moment I remembered Taste of Italy.  I figured, that would be something different so I jumped in my truck and headed that way.    I arrived and walked in.  The owner recognized me and took my order right away.  I ordered a meatball sub and side salad.  He made the salad right then and off I went while they worked on the sub.  I think you might be hard pressed to find a fresher salad.  It was crispy and clean and had excellent flavor.  So, my sub was brought out about the time I was finished with my salad.  The roll was perfect, the cheese melted and the meatballs were very good.  The only problem is that my phone rang just as I took a bite.  So, what to do?  I now have a scorching hot meatball in my mouth and trying to talk on the phone at the same time.  The cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and burnt, my eyes watered and I could not talk....   One slurp of Diet Coke and I was saved....   I am sure this has happened to all of you once in your life.     Well, to wrap up my review, I had an awesome lunch and a good price.  Clean surroundings and great service....     I think its as good as it gets!

We made it to Saddle Ranch a couple of times.  The first time was for dinner on my birthday.  The food and service was very good.    The second time was a few months ago when we had gone to McFaddens for drinks.  My wife apparently had a few too many 7 and 7's and decided(without my input) that she was going to "ride the bull" at the Saddle Ranch.  So, We made our way into the bar area and she paid the $3 fee and signed the release papers.  She was then taken to the bull and seated on top, awaiting the beginning of the ride.  I asked the operator to "take it easy on her".  He did not listen or did not care.  The bull started to move and made less than one rotation and she fell off, landing on her back, facing straight up looking at the bull.  I am not sure she knew what happened or how quickly it happened.  Needless to say her mechanical bull riding days are over.  Hopefully anyways!    This place is worth a visit.  You will have a good time.

We stopped for lunch this week.  When you walk in the door they greet you with a smile.  The place is nice and clean.  You pick up a small menu and mark with a pencil what you would like and hand it to the cashier.  You have many choices of different kinds of dogs with numerous toppings and add-ons.  Side orders are limited to fries, chips or potato salad.  For dessert you can have a fried Twinkie or Oreo.    The food was very good and the toppings/ add-ons were fresh.    We each had a hot dog with fries and two cokes.  The bill was $13.86.    The Ivy League is worth a visit.

I have taken my wife and kids here on numerous occasions and it is always a good experience.  The service is fast and friendly.  The portions are generous and tasty.  This place is just a old fashion family owned diner.

This place is way overpriced for what you get.   Everytime my wife wants to go here I think to myself "another $40 wasted"....      It just isnt that good....

We have eaten here about a dozen times in the last two years.  The service is always good and the quality of the food is good for the price.  We usually split the Sirloin Marsala and order a extra salad.  That is enough for both of us after we have bread with it.  The atmosphere is nice and it is always clean.  We take our four teenage girls and they always want to sit at the bar seats near the pizza oven.  I have found that sometimes we are treated to "samples" when we sit there.  Always a good experience!!

I stopped at Gus's for lunch today.  I always like to try new places close to the office.  So, I walked in and sat down at the bar.  The stools are too short which makes the bar way too high.  It is especially high if you have to eat off of it.  The rest of the place is pretty nice.  They have a few tv's and it looks clean.    I ordered a Meatball Sub with fries and a drink.  My food arrived about 5 minutes later at which time I asked for some Ketchup.  The sub was cold yet the cheese on it was melted....    Cant explain that....   The fries were almost too hot to eat yet I managed.   Overall, the food had very little flavor.  I finished eating and received my bill promptly.  I was somewhat shocked at an $11.11 bill for a sub w/fries and a drink.  Wait a minute, I was SHOCKED....    I mean really, come on......    There are literally dozens of pizza places to eat lunch and these guys are charging that much.    I guess I would think about returning to eat here if I could afford it.   Instead I think I will go to Barros and eat for less than half the price.     BAM!

My daughter and I stopped here for lunch about a month ago.  I had the brisket and it was really good.  I liked it so much that I took my wife back a couple of days later to eat again.   I will be coming back.

This place is out of business!  Proof that people in Goodyear wont pay $10 for a Panini.

I read the reviews and we decided to try it this past Saturday for breakfast.  We walked up to the counter, ordered and found a seat.  The young lady behind the counter was very friendly however they do not have Diet Coke.  I dont drink coffee and was bummed out when they told me "no Diet Coke".     The food came and the portions are big.  The presentation was good but the food itself is just okay.  It isnt anything special and I wouldnt go out of my way to make a special trip just to eat there. It lacked flavor.  Kinda Blah!     I think we will try it one more time to see if its any better.  Our meal with drinks cost $21.00, so it wasnt a bad deal just need to add some flavor.

Yesterday was our second visit.  I rushed home and picked up my beautiful wife to try Happy Hour at Tempo.  We had been here once before and it was above average.  This time we walked in and the place was EMPTY....  It was about 5:30 and we sat at the bar.    The bartender(female blond) had ZERO personality.  Seriously, I would have rather watched paint dry then strike up a conversation with her.  Anyhow, I ordered a draft beer and it was somewhat flat and unimpressive.  My wife ordered a margarita and she seemed to like it.    We decided to order some food.  My wife ordered Street Tacos and a side salad.  I ordered Flatbread with sausage and cheese in addition to a side salad.  My wife liked the tacos and my flatbread was so so.  The salads had to much olive oil on them and tasted slimy, oh and they both had tons of fresh sliced onion.    The place remained very quiet for happy hour maybe its because it is overpriced for what you get.    Our little stop for happy hour ran us a cool $43.00 with the tip.  Okay, I get it.  Its a trendy place with a non conventional menu but its not worth it.  In addition, I found the menu very limited unless I was interested in new age metro sheik(I just made that up), save the rainforests, reduce carbon footprint, type stuff.    I suggest that if this place is going to survive, menu and price change.  Trust me, even the regulars that "love" this place will quickly get tired of it.

We have been to Austin's 3 times....  The first two visits were pretty good..   The last one was enough to never return again.  $9 for chips and Guacamole..  They are overpriced.....    In addition, on the last visit there were two drunk guys yelling at each other as they sat at the bar....   kinda trashy...

We were at a loss yesterday to have breakfast.  We didn't want to go to IHOP, Crackerbarrel or Black Bear Diner.  I remembered that this place had just opened.    We walked in after noticing a full parking lot.  A smiling face greeted us and seated us without a wait. Our drink order was taken quickly and followed by our food order.  I don't think we waited more than 10 minutes for our food to arrive.  The food was good and prepared to order.  The place was clean and efficient.  My wife and I spent about 45 minutes eating and watching people come in and out.  By the time we left the entire place was full and there is a good reason for it.  Our bill was $18 and some change.  I think it was a very good value.  They have quite a few items on the menu for lunch and dinner.  I am sure we will be back to give it a try.

We had dinner here tonight because a couple of previous visits have been pretty good.  The place was busy and we sat at the bar.  The bartender was overwhelmed, not because it was overly busy but because she sucked!  Yup, I said it.....  She greeted us and proceeded to walk past us three or four times without taking our drink order.  Dirty glasses everywhere and the bar was trashed....  FILTHY....   The bartender finally took our order and we had our drinks after that but there was zero sense of urgency that's for sure.    It came time to order and I had the "wrangler" while my beautiful wife ordered the Salmon entrée and then we WAITED......   and waited...    Note to wait staff..  How about using serving trays...   I don't really like my plate squeezed up against your shirt and cleavage....  Just sayin...    My wife's Salmon was good as reported by her and my salad that I ordered with my dinner was pretty good...  Burger cold and not worth the price.   We finished our first round of drinks and placed them on the rail of the bar (a subtle signal that we might want more drinks).  The bartender passed back and forth and finally asked if we wanted more drinks... Dinner was over $50.....  Not that its expensive but you would think we would get good service and value for that price.     To the owners of the Haymaker:  People work hard and want to come to a play to relax and have a nice experience.  In addition, people are tired of bad service and food in the Goodyear area and that is the reason that your business is the third or forth at this location.  Cant ya do better than this???  If you want to know what good service is like in our area, go to Carabbas.  If you want to know what good bartenders are go to Native Grill...    I hope you are successful.  We need more choices for places to eat and drink around here, but I can tell you that you wont survive if this continues.    If you don't believe me, read my reviews and count all the places that are closed from bad food and service.

We have been here three or four times.  Each visit is good!  The drinks are cold and the service is friendly.  Try the salad pizza and thank me later......  It will change your life!
