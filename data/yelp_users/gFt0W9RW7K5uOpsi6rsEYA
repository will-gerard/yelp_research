I just went back yesterday for my second class with Carrie. I'm just shocked at how well my paintings have come out... she breaks it down so that it is so easy to follow along. For a person who has never painted in her life, this class has been just so much fun for me. I plan on going back since there are a few more paintings I want to try.  Carrie is such a great teacher, very receptive to what the class needs, and very kind! Supporting local artists is such a treat, the class is fun, and the studio is just fantastic!
