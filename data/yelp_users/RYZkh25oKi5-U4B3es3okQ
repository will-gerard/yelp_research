This is a really cute place unfortunately I had the worst omelet of my life here, the mushroom omelette. It tasted completely dried out and spongy like they cooked it in one of those microwave omelette dishes.  My friends that I was dining with enjoyed their meal.   The filet mignon Benedict was the favorite at the table. Service could have been a bit faster but it was adequate. My friends raved about how good their juices were because they were supposedly all homemade in house with juicers. My pineapple juice taste like anything you would buy in the supermarket so I'm not sure if that is really they case.

It's a biker bar. I love Harleys so this was so cool for me too see so many works of art lined up bike after bike after bike. One word... Beautiful. I was star stuck, I had just been to the infamous Jackson Barrot car show and there were a few cool bikes but this was like a showroom of awesome for the price of a tasty beverage.   At some point they announced,  "if you are the owner of an orange Harley, it just fell over" the crowd gasped including myself. It's ok it didn't even look scratched.  If you have a car and walk up they know so don't play they won't kill you unless you are a douche.   There was live music and a bunch of shops to buy things like corsets, patches, t-shirts, whips etc.  I picked up a cute set of pasties for $5

Too much noise from the hallway. At ALL hours of the night. Trust me. This place has potential with decor, location, pricing,(minus resort fees) and comfort. But the noise was unacceptable. We were woken up with everyone strolling in at all hours of the night and morning shouting epic things like: " WWWOOOHOOO VEGAASSS BABY" !!" That's cute, the first 4 or 5 times, but seriously at 4 or 5 am, it starts to get old.  Resort fees for anyone that is interested, is what makes your deal on priceline/internet go south.  Vegas adds resort fees. Which they say is for  'using the resort and getting the paper"etc.  We never got a paper, or used the "gym" and had to pay.  Mandatory fee.  But seriously if I am getting charged $25 a day extra I better get a paper at my door or something. I never did.  So, to me, the resort fee is a scam that you have to factor in while reserving a place in Vegas. This is apparently the "norm" in Vegas so be aware as your planning. I am sad, I didn't even get a deal on the new dolphin show.  If your gaming in their casino, well expect rude insensitive a-holes to neglect you. It was like a desert when it came to getting a drink while gambling. I spent quite a bit and nearly died of thirst. When I did get a drink,  I sat at the bar and they pre-fix the pouring spout to a 2 count (vs 4 count) and say they "can't control it" on the comped drinks.  The best deal was the giant cocktail for $20 we got before the LOVE show, in the love amphitheater . It was strong, good, and huge! The Love show was awesome. It made up for so much disappointment in the resort.  The bottom line in pricing: We paid for 2 nights ( Wed and Thurs.) and the 9:00 show with good seats, according to the web sites 'Love package" $358. According to their rep, that fee included taxes. Final bill in reality, was actually $448, with resort fees and other taxes that they "apparently did not include". Well, that is what the manager said when i questioned the price difference.

I liked this place. The service was excellent. The bread way amazing. The outdoor patio was great, it was a perfect evening in Vegas.  We had a couple of their specialty martini type drinks, they were all excellent with fresh juices and mixed perfectly.  The oysters were so fresh they seemed plucked straight from the ocean! I had my doubts ordering oysters and being in Vegas. But I had heard Anthony Bourdin has first pic flown in fresh daily, so I was confident they would be fresh, and they certainly did not disappoint.   The asparagus/prosciutto appetizer was strange, it sounded better than it tasted, I probably would not recommend ordering that due to some sort of odd seasoning they used.   I had a daily special appetizer, which had pork belly. I have never had pork belly so I decided to go for it, it was my favorite, quite delicious! It had crispy squares of pork with some sort of custard sauce in a pie crust with micro greens and white asparagus. The crust was addicting!  For main courses, I had the roasted chicken. I love roasted chicken, I make an amazing one myself, so I had to try what they did with it. Well, it was a huge disappointment. It was bland, flavorless, and dry. The sauce was so weak that came with it, well I could not tell what type of sauce it was. I would NOT recommend ordering this dish to anyone unless you are on a special diet that restricts seasoning.  My friend had the steak and frittes, and WOW that was so good! The steak was the best I have ever had. There was some sort of butter herb onion marmalade topping on the steak. The steak was so tender that it melted in your mouth, and with the topping, well it was sheer perfection! The frittes (aka fries) were crispy and delicious! I would highly recommend ordering this!  I ended up filling up on my friends steak and ditching the dud of a chicken dish. For dessert we had the profiteroles, I think. We gobbled them up so quick even thought we were stuffed that, well, I barely remember seeing them.  So the grand total with tax and tip was $230.90!  That was an awesome deal for the quantity and quality, and let's not forget being in Vegas!  Cheers to you Bouchon!

The worst Fairmont I have ever had the displeasure of staying in. First of all the beds are THE WORST. Mine was horribly uncomfortable and the pillows were worse. I tossed and turned every night trying to get comfortable. We had several rooms reserved under out group and 80% of our group said the beds were awful. (the other 20% said they could sleep anywhere and be fine). They actually had to put a board in my bosses bed because it was broken. At $250 a weeknight that is unacceptable.   They charged a coworker $5 to bring her a FORK! REALLY? I would hate to see what they would charge if I needed an extra pillow!  There were mosquitoes all over our room. I spent a majority of the time killing mosquito's trying to bite me. Mosquito's love me I didn't think I would need bug spray IN my room.  There was supposedly free wifi, well NO ONE could get or stay on the wifi it was constantly a "connection issue".   The remotes to the TV well you gave to stand within 2 feet of the TV pointing directly at it or they don't work. The phone in one room was broken with an annoying beeping, maintenance solution was to 'just keep it unplugged'.  There is only ONE trash can in the toilet area. Who has only ONE trash can? There is usually one in the front room and one in the bathroom minimum. It's very inconvenient to keep moving it around in the suite. I thought maybe it was just our room but they were all like that.  Whatever you do DON'T go to the outside bar in the main part of the hotel unless you want to be treated like a big poop by the management. (see my review)  Speaking of poop I think they allow dogs because there was a dog poop in the hallway they were cleaning off the carpet, which the oder totally permeated the hallway. It was pretty disgusting.  The only good thing was the maid service. They did a great job and I noticed extra nice touches, like folding our clothes in a neat pile and other extra details.

I have never been treated so rudely in my life. This is the outside bar at the Fairmont Princess near the pool. First off we were there for a work function after a hard day learning, our bosses treated to dinner at True food up the street. We came back to the hotel and all wanted to go on the waterslides at the pool and jaccuzzi. We were told the pool with the waterslides closed at 10, we managed to dart over at 9:30 in our bathing suits and cover ups on 3 of us, 1 had no cover up. We got to the pool and it was sad it actually closed at 5. So the staff misinformed us. We were told the other pool with the jaccuzzi was open all night. We opted to grab a cocktail then head over to the jaccuzzi.   All of us looked beautiful. I guess that is a problem at this bar NO HOT CHICKS in bathing suits. If that was a problem they should have told us there was a dress code. No one said a peep about our attire. But it was near 78 degrees and near the pool. No one said anything except all the old douchey men oogling us who stopped paying attention to their drunk girlfriends when we walked in. Several mad dogged me immediately and were making snide remarks which I ignored, while we waited for the bartender to come over which seemed like forever.   I told the ladies 'maybe we should not be here in bathing suits here' they said no it was fine. Anyway immediately guys were buying us shots (blow jobs to be exact) I passed mine to some guy next to me. I don't like them and felt it was an insult... Another douchebag guy comes up immediately and says "my friend will give you $20 bucks to see if your friends tits are real" REALLY? This is the Fairmont crowd? WOW.   Then after we just get our drinks some other betch who was making nasty remarks when we were ordering came over and asked to buy pot off us. Do we LOOK like drug dealers? In our bikinis no less? We blew her off and she went back to her friends who all proceeded to heckle us. Another obviously highly inebriated hag comes over and tells my friend to put her boobs away and something else I will not repeat. The drunk woman then goes to management points to us and the woman manager Tamara was her name I think.  Tamara (or Tanya) comes over with a large black bouncer and says 'I am going to have to ask you you leave" I was like 'excuse me? For what?" She says "you are all intoxicated and you have to go". I said we JUST got here check our bar tabs we have ordered ONE drink. We are paying guests at the hotel" She say says "Nope you are drunk you have to leave you are inebriated I say 'NO we are not drunk, how so? This is our first drink! I am NOT leaving check our bar tab we have only had one drink and I am finishing my drink." She turns to the bouncer and says "remove them now". I was like WTF? 'Touch me and we are gonna have issues".   I Iook over and the drunk betch is pointing and laughing and flips us off. The bartender agrees to refund one of my coworkers drinks who had just ordered and recieved a second drink if we leave. The rest of us had finished our drinks prepared to leave because of how douchey the whole scene was, and head to the pool. None of us had prior cocktails we were at a work dinner prior and a conference all day. This was ridiculous it was jealous drunk customers lying to the staff and they did not even TRY to investigate the situation.  Bottom line $11 for a bitter well drink and the management needs to be SERIOUSLY removed. I will NEVER come back to this hotel again. We spent several thousand dollars on accommodations this behavior was appalling and if it's any indication of how they now treat hotel guests well ALL Fairmonts are now OFF the list.

This is a great local little coffee shop located in a strip mall with some sort of a Zumba place next to it. It was thumping from the music of class next door when I got my coffee. Combined with the coffee shop music the two music's together were a little bit overwhelming for me first thing in the morning.   I'm glad I found a mom and pop type place close to my work. The large mocha was delicious and strong. I think it was $5. I honestly was sleepy and didn't remember.  I was humming around all day from it!  I love all the local art for sale. They had some pottery and jewelry for sale from local artists as well.  They have a really good iced coffee too. I wish they would get a coconut milk substitute but most places don't unfortunately.   Still I'm a fan!

100 times better than the True Foods here in Fashion Valley. Service went ABOVE and beyond, I wish I knew the name of our server for a shout out... she was AMAZING! She was such a great help she really knew her stuff and made great recommendations (a healthy brunette with beautiful blue eyes) and way on top of her game. The drinks came out slow but I am sure that was not her fault.   I had the scallops and they were SO DAMN GOOD and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this dish! All of our party of 12 seemed very happy with their meals. I tasted the curry and it was very good. We had a great crudette appetizer with a beautiful and delicious variety of veggies and hummus and pita. Everything was fantastic. I have to say I was not very excited when the boss wanted to go here because I have been to the fashion valley one a couple of times and was not impressed with any meal or beverage.   This location changed my mind about True Foods. It's just the fashion valley one that sucks.

We came here for happy hour and it did not disappoint they have a great happy hour and a large patio that's awesome for people watching.  I got a specialty cocktail for $4 called the fix which was refreshing and delicious. Vodka with mint and berry puree.   We ordered several plates of oysters, which adds up at $2.50 each. The mineit sauce came with the oysters was fantastic, but the oysters did have quite a few shells in them.  They need to be more consistent with the plating the first plate had yummy veggies on it second one didn't.  The pretzel fondue was very good too. I can't wait to come back and try dinner soon.
