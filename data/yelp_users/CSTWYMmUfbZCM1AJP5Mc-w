I've recently got into photography, so this was the absolutely perfect place for me to try out my new camera! I have never done anything in Vegas outside the strip, so this was a first for me!   There are a few reasons why I did not rate this 5 stars: - The cab from The Cosmopolitan to the museum was over $30. It really sucks that the cabbies rip you off so badly. Regardless of where you are, they always take you "around the strip" to reduce traffic... whatever.  - I did not feel that I had enough time to take all the pictures I wanted.  - A very short tour - only about an hour, which doesn't justify the prices of the tickets.    I booked my date/time on-line, which I would suggest doing because they seem to book pretty quick. We got there about 10 minutes or so before the tour started, so we were allowed to walk around the park directly across the museum building. The tour guide was great at his job, but I just felt that there was too much information to take in in such a short period of time. I was one of the only people taking pictures, so I had to quickly snap away while he was talking before moving onto the next sign. I really wanted to listen to the history, but I was focusing on the pictures and it took away from the actual tour.   Regardless, it was incredibly interesting and I love the fact that it is fairly new and a nonprofit organization. They focus on preserving the rich history of Vegas through old signs and art forms. When the tour was done, we decided to walk back... well at least as far as we can get. It was a great idea because we ended up walking through Downtown Vegas checking out Fremont St which is a MUST!   I am very happy that I found out about this place and I would def recommend checking it out if you have an extra hour or two!

I've been wanting to go to Mon Ami Gabi for a long time now, especially since my last visit to Vegas was a stay at Paris. I know all my friends always stop here, so I just HAD to check it out.  Anyway, we came here for breakfast on a Friday morning around 10:30. The patio looked full when we got there, however, we got seated right away! It was low 60s, maybe mid 60s, but the heated patio made it an absolutely amazing experience! Our table was directly across the Bellagio fountains, so not only were we enjoying the delicious food and great weather, but we also had a fantastic view! At that moment, life could not get any better ;-)  I ordered a mimosa and the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. I don't know if it was the mimosa, or just my mood, but it was THE BEST Benedict I have ever eaten ANYWHERE! mmm... My boyfriend had the ham & cheese crepes which he also said were amazing. Our server was very attentive and was super pleasant, so no complaints there! The prices were absolutely reasonable considering the fact that it is Vegas after all.  I know there is a M A G in Chicago which I will def check out soon, but nothing beats this Mon Ami Gabi's location on the strip... I will be back here next time and try their dinner menu. I want to give it 5 stars, but I will just have to wait and write an update :)

I heard about Grand Lux Cafe through a few friends, and I am very surprised I have never heard of it before (considering there is a HUGE location right in Chicago that I passed by yesterday). But anyway, I decided to check it out as our last lunch/meal in Vegas before we had to board the shuttle. It was a Saturday afternoon, and the rush of people on the streets was insane, so it took us a good 20 minutes or so to get to the Venetian. I love that hotel so much - so gorgeous, but we didn't have any time to explore, so we rushed over to the Grand Lux (very easy to find) and got seated right away. It's a very big restaurant, with plenty of seating and a very "grand" and beautiful interior, but it was PACKED!   With the little time that we had left, my boyfriend and I rushed through the menu and he ended up getting the Buffalo Chicken Rolls and I got the Spicy Flat bread Chicken sandwich - very good! My only concern was that the food took forever, so we literally had 10 minutes to eat and we had to go right away. The doggy bag came into good use when our plane was delayed for 5 hours...   Anyway, this place reminds me so much of Cheesecake Factory, but that makes a lot of sense considering it's the same owners. With that being said, the menu is endless, so I will def be making my way back here next time I am in Vegas. I LOVE the fact that it is 24/7, and I wish I knew that when I was there Fri night around 4 am when we were starving and everything around Cosmo had closed.   Service was good, but like I said, the food took way too long. I'd recommend this location and though it's a chain, the prices are very reasonable and there is def something on the menu for everyone.

So, I am planning my next trip to Vegas which I leave for next week, and I stumbled upon Le Reve on Yelp. I saw this show last time I was there - April '11, and I still remember it like it happened yesterday. The thing is, I haven't seen any other shows in Vegas, nor am I familiar with Cirque Du Soleil, but this was one of the best things I have ever seen in my life.   I was a bit confused as in what this show represents, or if there was a story behind it. If I knew that Le Reve meant "The Dream", it would have made a lot more sense to me in the beginning. You know how you can make up anything possible in your dreams, as crazy or amazing, or even scary? Well, that's how I felt watching this show. I was in absolute awe the entire time... I could not believe my own eyes! The music, the special effects, the acrobatics, and the lighting just kept getting better and better throughout the entire show! I was thinking to myself... how is it even possible for all of this to be happening!   The Wynn Theater is beautiful, and because the stage is designed around a circular pool, there are no bad seats in there. I heard it was one of the more expensive shows in Vegas, not sure if that's true or not, but you def get what you pay for. I know we bought them on-line while we were still in Chicago for a somewhat cheaper price, so there are discounts available if you look close enough.  We had a nice dinner at a cafe in the hotel beforehand, and had some time to kill before the show started, so we never felt too rushed. It was a gift for my dad's 60th birthday and we all had an amazing time during the show. I highly recommend this to anyone I talk to about Vegas, and I am even thinking about seeing it again next week with my boyfriend.

I normally would give this type of restaurant 4 stars, but because of the fact that it's in Vegas and it was a Valentine's dinner, I will go all out and give it 5 stars!   I had Sushi Roku as one of my bookmarks, and as I was sitting around waiting for my boyfriend, I realized that we didn't have reservations anywhere on Valentine's night. We had a show that night at the Caesars hotel, so I figured this would be perfect! I called and they took us in no problem. She did ask for my credit card to hold my reservation, but the machine was broken at the time. I wonder if they charge you if you don't show up..?  Anyway, it took us awhile to find this restaurant and I am pretty sure we went around and found every place you can eat at before we got to Sushi Roku. So for any future diners, the best thing to do just go through the Forum shops since it's located there, rather than the actual hotel. The atmosphere and decor is absolutely beautiful, from the lighting fixtures to the bathroom doors. We were sat at a table that had the view of the entire strip on one side and the other side looked out to Harrah's.. sooo cool! This is worth a visit just for the view alone!  The service was great but the food was even better...   For the appetizer we got the Tuna Sashimi Carpaccio - I have never had anything like it before. It was delicious and so fresh that the tuna pieces just melt in your mouth. For our entrees, we split a few rolls:  -Makoto Roll - It's a spicy Yellow tail & Shrimp wrapped with seared tuna in a creamy spicy sauce. It's probably one of the best rolls I've ever tried in my life.  -Rainbow roll, Crunchy Spicy Tuna, and one more that I don't remember. Every roll was unbelievably fresh and done to perfection.   For dessert, we both had cappuccino's and split a dessert - Raspberry bread pudding with Carmel... OH MY!   This was definitely the best meal of the trip and a perfect place for a date!

Giving this place a 3.5, but rounding it off to 4 stars...  While my boyfriend was getting ready at our hotel, I walked down to Caesars in hopes to score some tickets for the Absinthe show. After purchasing them, I had a sudden urge to get a drink at 10 am (hey, it's Vegas), so I stopped by here since it's right next to the ticket booth.   As I was waiting for him,  I got a small frozen Mojito for $13... It was good and hit the spot, however, I find this place to be ridiculously expensive, even for Vegas.   But due to it's AWESOME location for people watching and viewing the Bellagio fountains, this place gets 4 stars in my book.

This was my first time staying at a Hyatt and I couldn't be happier with my experience. This is also why I love Yelp so much... the reviews are almost always accurate, so I knew that my stay will be just as expected!   First off, one of the best continental breakfasts I've ever had at a hotel. There's everything for everyone with a very nice kitchen/seating area. There's oatmeal with 6 or so toppings to choose from, all kinds of cereal, a rotation of waffles, pancakes, and french toast, egg sandwiches, three or four juices to choose from, and bagels and such.   Secondly, an incredible staff that goes beyond and above to make sure your stay is perfect. My personal story that I just need to share - like the idiot I can be at times, I left my expensive camera/camera bag on the lobby floor when I was checking in. Obviously, I didn't realize that I was missing my camera until the second day, and after running around like a crazy person to our car and back to our room, I nervously came up to the front desk and asked if anyone found a camera from the day before. Not only did it not get stolen, the young man working at the front desk at that time, was incredibly happy to give it back to me and even said "I love seeing people's reactions" after a situation similar to mine. I wish I had his name, but he was genially happy to give me my camera back and you have no idea how great that feels for once...   Nice location too... plenty of shops and restaurants nearby. Spacious hotel, nice heated swimming pool and hot tub though we didn't get a chance to check them out.   I would mostly definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Phoenix area.

My boyfriend and I needed to grab a quick bite to eat in order to hold us over until the evening, so we stopped by  Pink's Hot Dogs. I've heard of famous Pink's, so I was excited to try out their food, though nothing beats Chicago's hotdogs, so I don't know what I was thinking!   I got the Polish Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog which sounds amazing, however, I couldn't have been more off! It had a very bland taste to it, despite everything that it came with. The hog dog itself is just OK, but the Pastrami pieces it came with were so dry, that it was almost hard to eat it. My bf had a regular hotdog which is hard to mess up, but he was also very disappointed. Besides the less than satisying taste, the prices are incredibly high as well.  It's in a great location inside of PH, which was convienant for us since we were staying across the street, however, I will not be back to Pink's. I have Earl of Sandwich bookmarked for next time, which I regret not checking out due to the stellar reviews it has on Yelp.

It's hard to put into words the experience I got from staying at the Cosmo, but I will try to do my best and make it as short and sweet as possible!! I can easily say that this was the best room I have ever had... or will have in a long, long time! I booked through Lasvegas.com for a 3 night stay at a Studio Terrace room. When we were checking in, the AWESOME guy who was helping us, asked if we would like an upgrade on the studio terrace with a view of the Bellagio Fountains for $25/per night. THE BEST $75 I HAVE EVER SPENT...!!! Seriously... we didn't want to leave our room. You also get a free, small bottle of water which is nice of them, but then again, this hotel can def afford it.   Anyway, our studio was amazing in every way possible. There is a huge bathroom, with a shower, soaking tub, and a separate toilet room. There is also a living room with a couch/desk, and the bedroom that is connected to the balcony. Everything is connected to a remote, so from turning on and off the lights to the XM radio on both flat screen TVs. Just one pointer i have to make, and we were def warned about this, but i am not sure how seriously we took him. The minibar/food in the room is all wired, so even if you move the food just a bit, the hotel may charge you right away. We were just messing around, looking through what we got and trying to find room for the food I brought from home, and i was immediately changed $75. Not exactly sure what the $75 was for, but all the food/drinks are hella expensive in the room. Anyway, we called the front desk right away and they removed the charges almost immediately, so the customer service we had at the hotel was great.   Like I said, our first night we were really tired and the view was so amazing, that we didn't want to leave. We ended up ordering room service which was brought to us hot and fresh within 30 minutes. The guy bringing the food even gave us a couple extra items for free, so nice touch :) We were starving, but the food was excellent and I was incredibly happy with our entire experience to that point.   The hotel itself is jaw dropping gorgeous... it's hard to put in words exactly everything it has to offer, but it's def a site to see. I can't comment on the casino since I don't really gamble, but I would probably recommend to go elsewhere to play. I don't think this hotel's main focus is on gambling, especially since I overheard that it's the only hotel that has a straight path from one side to the other, so people don't get mixed up at the slot machines/tables. We didn't get a chance to check out any of the pools because it was too cold, but I cannot wait to be back and party at the Marquee Day club. Speaking of Marquee, it was def a HUGE plus that all we had to do is take the elevator down to the club, but I really did not like the club at all - i have a separate review for Marquee.   As for food, when I was in Vegas two years ago, my family and I dined at Comme Ca and it was delicious from what I can remember.  Besides room service, i briefly checked out Holstein's and ordered food to go before a night out in Marquee. I ended up ordering the wrong thing though, and though it was good, I was disappointed. But I will def be back to this burger bar next time because the menu is insane! At 5 am, we decided to go check out Secret Pizza, but also to our disappointment, they were already closing. So, I def have a list of things to eat next time I am there.   Cosmo's location is absolutely perfect - right smack in the middle of the strip. It's very easy to get to other hotels from there and there a couple Walgreens/CVS very close as well.   I am still in awe of this hotel, and I truly cannot wait to come back and experience it all over again. Thank you Cosmopolitan for giving us one hell of a weekend!

There really is not much to say that hasn't been said already, but I will write my story/review anyway...  I flew Spirit a year ago to Ft. Lauderdale and had no problems, issues, or delays. This time, we flew to Vegas from O'hare Wed-Sat and it was a completely different situation. I knew about the luggage cost, so the additional $150 I had to pay for my boyfriend and I was something I was "okay" with. I paid on-line the night before because it's a bit cheaper that way. For carry-on, I paid $40 each way for his bag, and for my check-in luggage, I paid $35 each way.   We arrived to O'hare on Wednesday 2/13, with clear, blue skies in Chicago and obviously in Vegas, however, there was a two hour delay. So instead of leaving at 9:09 am, we ended up departing at 10:51 am. When we asked the extremely rude lady at the counter for the reason, all we got in response was an idiotic look and a "whhaaaaatttt?" At this point, my boyfriend was going crazy, but I was still "okay" with the situation because I've heard A LOT worse, and read A LOT worse.   Fast forward three days later... we arrive to the Vegas airport about 1.5 hours before our scheduled departure at 5:20 pm. We go through check-in and all that, get to our gate, and it says 5:54 pm. Ok.. fine... we can handle 30 minutes. I step out to get a drink, and my boyfriend calls me to tell me that it just got pushed to 8pm!!!!!!!!!!!! I get back to the gate, and they announce that the plane has a maintenance issue and is currently in San Diego. Not sure how much more time passes by, but we get another announcement that the plane is now delayed until 9:30 pm and that there is something wrong with the plane and is getting a part replaced in San Diego. WOW...   At this point, they called everyone up to receive a voucher. I got in line thinking it may be a voucher for a free flight or something (HA!), though my boyfriend was against getting anything from them, and we ended up getting a voucher for a meal in the airport for $7 per person... are you freaking kidding me?! We ended up using it and it was not even enough to cover two pretzels and two drinks... thanks a lot Spirit!!! It's more like a joke than anything...   At one point in our short stay at the airport, I walked by the screen, and saw that the departure now says 10:04 pm... these bastards didn't even announce anything until 15 minutes after I saw the time on the screen. There was nothing anyone could do but wait... and that's what we all did.   NEVER AGAIN am I going to fly through Spirit... I don't know how the hell this company is still in business or operating. I highly doubt that they were fixing the plane... they just don't have enough of them and what is a 5 hour delay to their passengers?!?! The staff is beyond rude.. I feel like that's a requirement when they apply for this job. I had a great trip, but this totally ruined everything and I am still recovering from exhaustion!!!

JoBot Coffee is a very cool and hipster coffee/breakfast/lunch spot. I was in Phoenix for a few days and found this place due to high ratings. We were going on a hike, but i wanted some coffee beforehand and we ended up here. We both got two iced coffees  (it was very strong coffee) and I also bought one Pear donut that was seriously out of this world! Considering the size of the shop, they have a pretty extensive menu and everything sounds and looks good.   The best part to me was the outdoor patio - coming from a city that's been under a polar vortex, I was in pure bliss sitting outside in beautiful weather, enjoying the view, and the nice crowd. There was a DJ playing some Indie Rock on the side of the building, so that just added on to the experience.   It's also a dog friendly cafe which always makes me super happy since I never see that back at home. I can't wait to come back to Phoenix and when I do, JoBot will be my coffee stop!

I stopped in twice here during my three day stay at the Cosmopolitan. The first stop was unexpected because I didn't realize that this hotel has a coffee/cafe shop, so when I saw gelato, I had to check it out. I got a small scoop of the Nutella gelato... Ahhhmazing :)   My second stop consisted of 3 min before I had to be on the shuttle back to the airport, so I didn't really pick and choose what I wanted. I grabbed three desserts  - a Chocolate cannoli, a delish looking cheese danish for the bf, and a raspberry tart pastry. Three pastries equaled to about $15, which is wayyyy too much for my liking. But due to its incredibly convenient location next to all the restaurants and stores on the 2nd or 3rd floor (don't remember), I give this place four stars rather than three. Also, everything I did try, was incredibly delicious and fresh.   I hope my next stay in Vegas will be at the Cosmopolitan, because honestly, it does NOT get better than that, so I will def be back to Va Bene for a quick bite to eat, or just some cold gelato to cool off in the heat!

My oh my... I've never been happier to accidentally stumble upon a restaurant. It was one of those dining experiences where everything was perfect from the food to the service. I was debating between this restaurant and Bandera since both have excellent reviews, but I realized there was a Bandera location in Chicago so that helped me make my choice.   Starting with drinks, I've always wanted to try a Moscow Mule, and at Citizen Public House, all of their drinks have a signature mix to them. I HIGHLY recommend it... it was done way before we received any food :)  Now onto the food...   I ordered the Pan Seared Scallops with Roasted Corn Grits - it was one of the BEST meals of my life!!!! I've had scallops numerous of times, but these were the most delicious and delicate I've ever tasted. The corn grits were an incredible addition to the scallops as well... just trust me and get them!  My fiancé had the Buttermilk Roasted Chicken - smart Chicken breast, sweet corn-butter bean succotash, roasted Brussels sprouts, truffle oil, pecorino Romano. It's a very popular item and I tried a bit and it was great (not as good as my scallops though). We both practically licked our plates clean... and he's not much of a food lover ;-p  We were stuffed, so no room for dessert, but I WILL be back when I'm in the area again. Our server, who's name I forgot, was excellent and very helpful. The entire night was amazing and definitely the best dinner of our trip to AZ!

Absinthe - I LOVE YOU! (not the drink, but the show) They did have a bar, so maybe they give drinks with Absinthe in it as well... I wouldn't be surprised ;-)  Anyway, I was looking for a good show to go to with my boyfriend and I really wanted to do a Cirque Du Soleil show after seeing Le Reve when I was there last time, but they are all so expensive, so I ended up keeping this one in mind. I think any show in Vegas is a great show, so it really doesn't matter, but can I just say how incredibly happy I am that we went here!?!  I strolled down early in the morning to the grounds of Caesars Palace because that's where my friend told me they sell the tix. I didn't know this, but there was a guy giving out coupons for the show just a few feet away from the ticket booth, so keep that in mind, however, the girl ended up giving me a discount regardless!   It was Valentine's day, so we had a really nice dinner at a Sushi restaurant at Caesars, then made our way down to where this tent is parked right near Serendipity 3. From the outside, it looks like a crappy Circus tent, so I was thinking.. "oh boy, what did we get ourselves into?!" But once you enter, it's an entirely different feeling. The only crappy thing I can think of was the wooden chairs that were hard to sit on and the columns that hold up the tent, since they were blocking my view, otherwise it was all just amazing!   The best way to describe Absinthe is that it's a mix of crazy things you can see in Vegas on any given day, but with an insanely hilarious twist of comedy and some damn good acrobatics!  Or as they have it on their website, "a acro-cabaret variety show." Just like many Yelpers mentioned, you really need to be open minded or have a sense of humor, otherwise, you will get offended. We were laughing to the point of our faces hurting for hours after the show.   There is no point on giving away details, but I whole heartily recommend seeing Absinthe. For the money, you get way more than your average show, and with memories to last a lifetime! I will DEF see this again, hopefully in the near future.

I originally wanted to rate this 3 stars as this hotel definitely doesn't deserve any more, but unfortunately, it's gone down a rating IMHO. I never ever leave anything in the hotel room once I check out, but for some reason, not only did I leave my coat in the closet but also a charger for my camera battery. I checked out of the hotel but my trip continued to Sedona, which is where I realized that I had forgotten my things. I called the hotel right away, but was put on hold for 20+ minutes and I hung up. I called back and she said "sorry, long line", which I understand, so whatever. She took my information so she can ask the housekeeping department, but of course, I never received a call back. Yes, it's my fault for leaving it in the room and I didn't expect to have it back, but she could have at least been nicer and given me a call at some point in the night.  The service overall was similar to my experience above - rude and unpleasant. The morning crew, maybe the managers, were the only nice ones we've encountered. When we checked in at 2am, one of the elevators was not working so the lady at the front said we'll have to just take the stairs all the way up with our luggage (we were on the top floor) and did not offer any additional help. It was only 6 floors, but we had a lot of luggage and we were tired as hell from traveling. There was also a very nasty smell in the hallways the entire time..   The good:  The free breakfast was probably one of the nicer ones I've had. They always had eggs, potatoes, gravy, different types of cereal, and excellent coffee. Each day they switched up on either pancakes, waffles, or french toast. No complaints there... it's definitely a nice way to fill up in the morning for "free". They have some outdoor seating available, which we took advantage of because of the BEAUTIFUL weather.   They have a pretty big pool area - two pools actually with a "waterfall". One of the pools is somewhat heated, while the other is not. It was too chilly to swim in the mornings and we were gone all day, so I only had one late night swim, which was pretty sweet!   The hotel room itself wasn't too bad either - big bathroom with a very spacious sink counter, somewhat nice view, and an OK bed. The bed itself was comfy, but the sheets were hard and unpleasant.   Overall, this hotel is OK for the money and is in a great location as it is super close to downtown Phoenix and a very quick drive over to Scottsdale. I am not sure if I'd come back though since there are better options in the area with a nicer crew.
