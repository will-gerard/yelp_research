My friend and I wanted to try some new Thai in the area. We chose Thai Food Corner based on the reviews. We were NOT disappointed. We ordered the Thai Toast, which we had no idea what to expect, and it was fabulous. It was served with their cucumber relish, which the whole dish is best when eaten all together. The Egg drop soup was decent. I chose the Pad Thai, mild (cause I'm a wimp) and it was fabulous. It has a great combination of chicken and veggies. My friend got the yellow curry which was equally as delicious. The portions are large and could easily be shared. Long story short, try this place it's delicious.

I can not begin to express how much I LOVE Spoonz Cafe. I am greeted every time I enter the shop and have only received great customer service. Where the gold is, is the soups. It changes daily and they're amazing. I have tried about 10 different soups and not one has been a miss. The coffee is average but where it lacks, the pastries and treats make it up. The online ordering is convenient and your food is waiting when you arrive to pick it up.

Not what I'm used to for Mongolian food. The meat was pre-cooked (I'm used to the frozen stuff) which I felt didn't pick up the sauces flavor. One of the charms of mongolian is mixing your own sauces to create something unique for yourself. Think you can do that here? Absolutely not. Being used to pouring my own sauces I grabbed the ladle to get my sauce which was ripped out of my hand and explained they don't put sauces on the grill.   At our table they had little tablets where you could purchase games and actually check out and pay for your meal. Even with the option of splitting the bill. Do you think that service worked? Absolutely not. We tried splitting the bill where only one person got to pay using the device, my bill wouldn't go through, my best friends bill only partly paid. We asked for assistance and no one knew how to fix it. It's a great idea that just wasn't executed.   If you're looking for true, yummy, make your own Mongolian.... keep driving past this place.

Awesome venue and atmosphere. This is a great place for a celebration or birthday. Yes they play a birthday song for every birthday but that makes this place unique. Its fun and the face masks are hilarious.   We ordered the Calamari rings which the portions were little (but with the rest of your food trust me you won't be hungry). As for the teppanyaki, we got two orders of the Steak and chicken to split between 4 people. There is a $7 share fee but this is so both people can get the salad, rice, and soup with the grilled meats. Well worth the cost. Everything was delicious. I suggest you try everything with their "Yum Yum" sauce/ White Sauce (even though they tell you its for seafood). Over all very entertaining.  If I had to pick a negative, I didn't like that they pressured you to take the sake. We had to pretend we weren't 21 to get out of it. It is a fun thing for the restaurant but no means no. But on a positive note, it's cute they do the same for the kids, but in a baby bottle filled with Mountain Dew.
