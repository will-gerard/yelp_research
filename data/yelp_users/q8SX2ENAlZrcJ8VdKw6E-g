Clients Beware!  My 8year old son was referred to go to this facility by our dermatologist since my son was not responding well to his wart treatments.  Apparently this place has a pretty powerful laser to treat warts.  Upon arriving (after a one hour drive)  I had to check the address a couple times to verify that I was in the right place( very ghetto)  Once checking in and filling out all the paperwork, I was instructed that the laser had been broken for over a week!!  HELLO- I just drove an hour and had to pull my son out of school in order to make this appointment.  If u could give 0 stars I totally would.  This isn't a facility that I would ever visit again!!!

What a great Practice!   Doctor Lokey's is an extremely knowledgable doctor and she has such a warmth to her, that it makes it easy for anyone to openly communicate with her.

Arizona's Dukes of Air joined the Chamber 2 years ago and it's been phenomenal to network with so many great businesses.  If you own a business and work in Gilbert you definitely should join the Chamber!!

I had breakfast here this morning for a business meeting and really enjoyed the entire experience. The food was great, the staff was wonderful and it was super cool to eat outside while watching the airplanes come and go!  I will definitely be coming back with my kidos.

My daughter decided that she wanted to come to the Rainforest Cafe for her 11th Birthday. We arrived close to 5 pm on a week night and it wasn't very busy. The atmosphere was super fun and kept the kids busy looking around. We ordered an appetizer and the drinks first and received them pretty quickly.  The thunder storms reminded us of the Midwest. Our food arrived in a fair amount of time and we all left full. If you are looking for a fun place to eat with your kidos and are ok w some noise this is the place to go!!!!

This that been a family favorite for many years.  The food is delicious and the Bellini is pretty tasty.  We recently visited to celebrate my birthday with our kidos and it wasn't a normal great visit.  I think our waitress was having a tough evening and our table was totally uneven on the patio so our food trays kept sliding to the side of the table.  We told the waitress however nothing changed :)  I might suggest it's time for a few new tables

I am sick to my stomach!!  I just had a bug on the lemon in my water.  When addressed with the manager Dan he was unprofessional and failed to provide any sympathy and or apology on behalf of the restaurant. He comped the POTATO CHIPS on our bill!!. I understand stuff happens however its the tact in how the situation is handled when something does go wrong that will make or break the after thoughts of your customer. I will NOT be returning to this restaurant

My daughter and I decided to try this nail salon for the first time last night.  Our last pedi was a month ago.  Unfortunately we were completely disappointed!  Our nails were trimmed to the point of pain, my callus/cracks weren't removed from my heal and the polish looked like like it had been done by an amateur not a professional.  Furthermore they don't use tub inserts and the cleanliness was less than par.  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone

I finally found my nail salon of choice!  My daughter and I got in right away without an appointment for pedi's and mani's.  The ladies were all very nice, knowledgable and did a great job on our nails.  I will definitely be back

Such a fun candy store!  This store has all your favorite candies from back in the day to the latest and greatest.  My boys absolutely fell in love with the candy Legos.  I have had fun purchasing some of my old favorites and having the kids try them out!  The owner is always very pleasant while we are there too

This review is long overdue!  Both of my boys were determined to have their Birthday parties here.  The scheduling process was super easy and the staff is great.  The owner Brian and his daughter Emily are extremely accommodating.  We had a party room designated for us so the kids could chill in between rounds and this was also where they were able to eat pizza and open gifts.  The arena is huge and so much fun to sneak around hunting your opponent.  Several of the kids who celebrated with my boys have since had their own birthday party at VIP Airsoft!  Both of the boys talk about VIP often and they are determined to have their parties here again.  If you have a child who loves being a "boy" and enjoys playing with toy guns this is definitely a place to bring them!!!!!!

I recently suggested that my mother contact Mr. Tobler about a personal injury.  Nathan took the time to listen to the story, offer honest suggestions and give feedback on how to proceed.  If you are looking for an A+ personal injury attorney who is going to be honest and work 110 % to get the job accomplished then you need to call Mr. Tobler!!!!

I meet a friend here for a business lunch. Probably not a good location choice.  It was poorly lit and the music was rather loud. I felt like I have to talk REALLY loud.  We ordered nachos and it arrived to the table dripping in Chili. They were so nasty tasting that neither of us could eat them. This may be a decent place to watch a sports game and grab a drink however it certainly is not a lunch spot!!!

I am super bummed!  I was excited to find a pool company that was close to my home with really good reviews.  I contacted the company to discuss rust colored stains that showed up rather quickly on my pool floor.  The owner was very nice on the phone and offered to come over first thing the next day to provide me with a free evaluation.  The next day came and I didn't hear anything by 5pm so I called the company.  The owner apologized sincerely and noted that he completely forgot to come over.  :( I totally get that mistakes happen so I accepted his apology and we agreed that he would stop over the next morning between 7:15-7:45am.  The day came and again by 3pm, I hadn't received a visit nor had I received a phone call so I contacted the company again only to receive another apology that he totally forgot about our appointment.  He offered to be over in approximately one hour. I can handle forgetting once however twice is unacceptable!!   If he can't show up for an initial visit how on earth could I count on this company to show up and maintain my pool!  Please note 2 stars instead of 1 because the owner was very pleasant on the phone and did apologize.

Tried this place out with a girlfriend a few nights ago.  We had 2 appetizers and a tasty beverage.  The service was great and our apps were tasty.  This might be a good place to try for a girls night out.

We rented the patio space for our company get together and everyone had a great time.  I was nervous about the buffet meal however it tasted great and  received positive feedback from our team.  We would totally recommend Casa de Mina for company parties and for a tasty meal

Eric and his team did an exceptional job on the vehicle wrap for Arizona's Dukes of Air!   They paid attention to the details that we were looking for and the truck turned out so nice that we get calls from people who see it driving down the road, who simply call to  tell us how awesome it looks!!  I will not hesitate to use Eric and his team again for my next vehicle wrap.  THANK YOU

I couldn't have asked for more when I needed legal assistance. Terry Fong's honesty and speed to assist me with what I needed was more than I could have asked for. If you are looking for a great attorney, look no further. Terry Fong Law Group is wonderful!!!

I was really surprised when I called to schedule my appointment and was told that Jen had been fired for reason X,Y and Z  I was sadly disappointed because she did a great job grooming my dogs and was really good with them.   Today when I arrived a woman by the name of Jennifer greeted me took one of the dogs and placed her on the grooming table.  Without conversation she buzzed the top of her back and asked me if that was a good length.  I said it was too short and she adjusted the cut.  I would have thought when I picked up the dog the hair on her back would have been blended not one patch shorter than the rest   The second dog was groomed shorter than normal however he looked fine.  Both dogs received a nice bath and were cleaned up when I arrived.  Jennifer handed me my payment slip and told me to go up front and pay before I could get my dogs.  This really upset me because of course they could see me thru the kennel and they were excited to be reunited.  I asked to see and have my dogs and was instructed that was against policy.  I walked up front, paid my bill and expressed my frustration with the two employees at the counter before heading back to get my dogs.  I gave two stars because my dogs did get cleaned up however I will not be returning!!

What a fun Irish pub if you're looking to stop for a drink.  We were starving and the waits were extended downtown on a Saturday night so we decided to try the food here.  Our dishes were filling and tasted ok.  Definitely not a dinner destination place by plan however not bad.

My Husbands job is very physically demanding and he has had a fair amount of aches and pains in his back, neck, shoulders etc.  He isn't someone to complain, however I thought it would be in his best interest for him to visit a Chiropractor.  I scheduled the appointment and sent him in to see Dr. Eric. My hubby was against the idea from the minute, I told him he was going however he went (for me).  After the initial consultation he had nothing but good things to say about Dr. Eric and his practice personally however he was still not sold on the need to see a Chiropractor.  I convinced him to stick with it and go for a second visit which he did.  After the third visit he had to call me (all excited) to tell me that he can move his neck further than he has been able to in years.  My Husband went from one Extreme to the other and know he can't wait for his next visit!  Thank you Dr. Eric Garst !!!!

BEWARE!!!!  I have tried this place a few times thinking that maybe the employee was new or maybe I hadn't communicated my expectations clearly however today was awful!  My Old English Bulldog went in for a bath, clean up, nail trim (bronze package) He got a great bath and smells good however his nails are rough ( they were suppose to grind them and didn't) and his ears didn't get touched.  My second dog is a schnau-tzu who weighs in around 5 pounds.  I asked for his hair to stay long (teddy bear) style however he got chopped (REALLY BUTCHED) The stylist Darci told me that they only trim the body with electric clippers.  I found this concerning as this has never been the case with any groomer before.  I just paid 49.00 dollars for my dog to be fully groomed not to have a clippers raced around his body.  The attached picture show what they did to my dog and the bottom left is how he normally looks.  This place is Horrible...

We were super excited to see Everest at an IMAX in 3-D however our experience at this theatre was not good.  First off it cost 77 dollars for 2 adults/3kids to get in which I would have been totally fine with had the following not been noticed - the rugs throughout were extremely dirty and gross - the bathrooms were atrocious!  There was what appeared to be pee on the floor and the smell was ripe - the chairs were ripped and in need of repair - something made my husbands allergies go out of control the moment we took our seats until we left.  This place should be closed down!  We will not be returning EVER and I strongly encourage anyone reading this to go elsewhere as well !!!
