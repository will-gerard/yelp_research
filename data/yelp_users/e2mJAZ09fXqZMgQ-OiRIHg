I've been eating at Miracle Mile ever since I can remember, initially at the old Christown Mall location.  For my youth, it was the only Jewish/American deli I knew.  It's still great after all these years and location changes.  I've since eaten at a few deli's that can top it, but not by much.  I'm not going to run down everything I've eaten over the years; you know what deli's have to offer and this place is no exception.  Get your matzo/pastrami/corned beef/chicken soup on, homey!

Many reviewers have already done a great job reviewing this restaurant so I'll just weigh in with my rating and share my two experiences.  To date I've ordered take out once and eaten in once at El Conquistador and was very satisfied with both experiences.  My first experience was ordering take out with my wife; as it was our first venture we both ordered the El Conquistador burrito (Chile Relleno, Steak Picado, Guacamole & Beans). The burrito was very good; the chile relleno was moderately spicy and firm, the steak was well seasoned and served medium and the beans were well prepared and likely scratch made.  One often overlooked but key item really delivered; the tortilla. It was a superb flour tortilla and if not scratch made then they're sourcing it from someone who knows what they're doing.  My second experience was group dinner in which I ordered Carne Asada tacos (soft).  The tacos were simple (as one should be), fresh and delicious. The beef appeared to be slow cooked in an oven rather than a traditional Sonora style grilled asada but that did not take away from the quality.  If you're a cabeza fan then you'll love their asada.  The obligatory chips and salsa were excellent. Homemade, thin yellow corn chips and two salsa options; a fresh, mild, traditional but tasty rojo and a smokey, spicy offering that was quite good.  The restaurant itself was very clean. On both visits I was served by the owners, apparently a husband and wife duo.  The wife was fun, friendly and attentive.   If you're craving some greasy, cheddar cheesy hangover curing Sonoran style gut bombs then hit up Mixtecca.  But if you want some terrific, homemade authentic Jalisco style food at a fantastic price you should get yourself to El Conquistador with the quickness.

In a word...grody.  The second I walked in the door I was lambasted by a serious stank. It smelled like sewage and industrial cleaners. I should have done an about face at this time but I foolishly pressed on.  I ordered the Red Devil white calzone, which was advertised as mozzarella, olive oil, fresh Roma tomatoes and garlic. The mozzarella was over abundant and flavorless, the tomatoes were mealy, underripe and were decidedly not Romas (likely Beefsteak or Mountain Pride). The garlic was nearly raw and jammed into the calzone by the fistfull.   I'm not a restaurateur but in my estimation the two most oft repeated sins of Italian restaurants is to not make their mozzarella in house and to overload every dish with garlic. Mozzarella is easy and inexpensive to make and I love garlic but there is definitely such a thing as too much.  I will not be returning to this location. However it should be noted that I ate at the Pinetop location last year and both the food and the ambiance were excellent.

When the original location at 75th & Indian School opened back in the 90's there were few places like it in the valley  (prior to the "'Bertos" explosion of the aughts) and it was, in the parlance of the day, the bomb. Super nachos, yo!  Ramiro's has since opened and closed several locations and lamentably the quality has suffered since the West Side (Wessside!) heyday. The food here is decent and fairly priced, but nothing that will knock your socks off. A good after hours joint to aid in soaking up the poison you've consumed all evening.

The old neighborhood standby is still doing it right. Pub grub with a twist, great beer selection, attentive service...even O.T.B. for the degenerates! The best pub option in the Bellair-rea (groan).

Are you a dude that needs a haircut? Then go here and ask for Lazar. He's the owner, he's good, he's quick, he's friendly and the basic cut is $14. Been going for a year or so and haven't had a bad experience yet.

I tried this place this weekend at the suggestion of friends who live nearby. The place is very clean and had an open kitchen, which is always a plus in my book.  The service was very good and we got our food quickly.  They are grilling some great looking beef and chicken here, yet sadly I didn't see any lamb on the menu.  I had the tri-tip kebab sandwich and my wife had the gyro.  Both were very tasty but what really made the meal was the 10'' pitas they are making from scratch.  They have a 6" pita that appears to be sourced from Kronos (the large Greek food supply company, not the young Titan and son of Ouranos and Gaea) but the 10" pita is homemade and ridiculously good. It has more in common with a buttery roti than a pita. Big-ups to my friend Emir for cluing me in on them.  We also had the Flaming Feta, it was fantastic, we'll definitely be getting it again.  If you like heat, be sure to ask them for their Greek hot sauce, it was a very spicy green sauce that had a unique flavor that I really enjoyed.  The only downside to the meal was the quality of the veggies in the sandwiches.  The tomatoes were pale and mealy and the lettuce was a little wilted.  I'll be returning to Greek Wraps, the 10" pita is something I'll be craving until I have another crack at it.  There were also several other dishes on the menu that looked to have a lot of potential.  If you're in the area stop in and get some very good Greek grub.

Mixteca is my go-to spot for Mexican fast food. It's primarily Sonoran and Baja fare.  All the staples are very good but a few standard orders are the Torta Cubana, Carne Asada/Green Chile/Machaca burritos and shredded beef tacos.    This place isn't going to blow your mind with anything new but as far as Valley Mexican fast food chains go, this is one of the better options.

The Prime lived up to its name.  The pevious reviewers have got it right about the great service, cleanliness and fantastic food.  I'm more just weighing in so that my rating is factored into the average.  On my first visit (of what will likely be many to come) a group of us ordered:  Kung Pao Beef and Chicken Mongollion Beef Spicy Chicken Yui Shan Chicken Crab Puffs Egg Rolls  All of them were spot on, the best I've had in the valley and I've been frequenting valley Chinese restaurants for 30 years.  If there's better Chinese food in the greater Phoenix area, please let me know!  Stop reading and get to The Prime posthaste!

Stopped in for some Ranchera, went home with a bunch of fresh and cheap veggies, snacks, beers and sodas.  This is a really good representation of a valley carniceria; penche gringos may turn up their noses but valley g√ºero's who know what time it is will dig it. They had a fantastic looking seafood counter, everything looked super fresh and you can't smell even the slightest hint of fish in the air. The staff was very helpful to boot. This is likely your best option on this side of town.  Heads-up on the address, though. It's actually 1708 W. Bell Road...there...that should keep you from crashing into the QT trying to find it.

Oh, Pong Pong, how far you have fallen...  I started ordering take out from Pong Pong about 8 years ago; then the food was of great quality, the best Chinese take out in the area. These days the quality is pretty lousy.  I just picked up some take out a few days ago and sad to say, I won't be coming back again.    It feels like the owners have given up.  The interior has gotten dirtier with each visit. Seriously, if you stop in take a peep at your surroundings; the caller ID box and phone on the counter, the register, the handles on the beverage cooler, etc., they are all covered in black grime.  The people who touch this grime also handle your food.  The quality of the ingredients and the preparation of those ingredients has taken a major slide as well.  It seemed that several years ago, those doing the cooking had a sense of pride in their work, which resulted finesse in dishes that's unusual for typical Chinese-American fare.  You could tell subtle differences in preparation from one cook to the next...one would do the egg rolls a little peppery and spicy, the other would do them more vibrant and acidic.  Now it's all bland mush.  If you're looking for decent Chinese in the area, try Golden Rice Express, My Corner or any of the other offerings. None are as good as Pong Pong once was, but all are better than Pong Pong of the present.  I hate to give what was once a beloved staple such a poor review, but that's the way the fortune cookie crumbles.

I've gone to Napoli a few times in the past month and I'm still digging them...a lot! First a word on my ratings; I rate within the genre.  So when I give something four or five stars, I'm taking into consideration the type of joint I'm reviewing.  I've had slices of the thin crust cheese, sausage and meatball pizza so far and have tried the meatball and sausage calzones.  All were seriously good, with the meatball being my favorite of both.  However my wife loves the sausage (...hmm, no good way to write that one).  We've had the wings once and although there were very good, they are the reason why I didn't rate this place a five.  They were extra heavy on the vinegar, but that may have just been an anomaly so I'll be giving them another go. This place has replaced Lucky's Pizza as my go to calzone spot and just may replace my preferred wing place too.  Time will tell.  One last thing, I've read some reviews by people attesting to the fact that the owners are authentic Italian immigrants.  I hate to break it to you but despite what you've heard or even what the owners told you themselves, they're actually Albanian.  But don't let that bother you though, you don't have to be Italian to make good pie!

I love Villa Deli! Always clean, always fresh and always friendly. A bit on the spendy side for a sandwich shop, but they use very high quality ingredients so ya gets whats ya pays for, capiche?   Get the chicken parm or the Italian, both are great but really anything would be good on their bread. Just wish they were open on Sunday. Oh, grab some meatballs to go too, they will supe-up any of your homemade dishes quite nicely.

I went to Don & Charlie's last weekend with my wife's family.  I'd been plenty of times before, but the last was...oh, let's say 1985-ish. I was worried that it wouldn't live up to my memories.  Fortunately the place doesn't look like it has changed since "We are the World" was tearing up the pop charts and the food hasn't either, in a good way.  First, the chopped liver is a must. They'll ask if you want it, just say yes, even if you think you don't like liver.  I think I don't like liver and I can tell you that I'm mistaken.  I had the fish of the day (Mmmm. That sounds good, I'll have that.); halibut, broiled.  My wife had prime rib, rare and we both had the Au Gratin.  We demolished it all and wished that there were more.  There wasn't.  So we had a hot fudge sundae and key lime pie for dessert.  This was the only minor disappointment. The sundae was good but the hot fudge they serve it with was nearly cold. The key lime pie was a little mild for my taste.  Give me my fudge hot and my pie bold, I always say (I've never said that).  Don & Charlie's is an old standby for a reason, so go check them out.  Or drop back in if the last time you visited was for your post Hands Across America party.

Top's - oh how I love beer so oh how I love Top's!  I don't drink wine, I've tried and tried but I rarely like it. So all the better that I review their wine selection. There's a lot and it's mostly in bottles. This is where I'd go if I was trying to locate girls, Europeans and/or winos.  Now, on to the beer!  There a lot and it's mostly in bottles...however the contents taste a lot better than that stuff over in the wine section. But be warned, there's nary a female, Euro wino in sight. Go here if you need/want/like a ridiculous selection of beer.  I'll pull a Stan Lee here, with a  "'Nuff said".

Some great barbecue here. We had the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches and both were pretty much perfect. The mac and cheese is straight up magic. This place is a bit of a mad house though. Always seems to be a crowd and a bit of a wait, but their food is worth it. The staff was on point, providing great service all around. I particularly liked the dinning room atmosphere. Barbecue should be simply and delicious, and that's what you'll find here.

This one is easy...PoPo's is the real deal, straight up.  It's been a institution for 46 years; I first ate there back in 1980.  This is classic, Nana's style Sonoran food.  I noticed that there are some reviewers here that rave about it but only rate it at 3 stars...por que?    Heed not any naysayers. You don't stay in business for half a century making bad Mexican food in a town saturated with Mexican restaurants.   It requires no further explanation; no "this was good but that was bland." "It's a shady part of town." "Parking is wack!".  It's a given that it's in Maryvale, the lot is small and in 46 years some individual dishes here and there are bound to be misses.  Just go there, order what looks good and you'll see for yourself why this place keeps packing them in year after year.

Not much to say about Valle Luna that hasn't been said. In my opinion Valle Luna represents Sonoran-American food as well or better than any other establishment in AZ. This is not "authentic" Mexican cuisine per se, but it is the authentic Sonoran food all of us valley natives (gringos and chicanos alike) grew up eating. Always great service and specials to boot.   Get your arses up there, you pinche gabachos!

The basics: Good selection of Korean, Chinese, Japanese and Indian goods Large produce department Small-ish seafood counter Small-ish onsite bakery  The pros: A nice variety of produce that is typically very fresh and very affordable Oodles of noodles! Good selection of Indian goods Bonus!  They carry German/Russian/Eastern European items Great beer, soda and juice variety Good, cheap Thai chile's!  Cons: The entrance can smell like Kim Chi (good if you love kim chi, bad if you don't I suppose) Staff isn't very knowledgeable Not enough Southeast Asian packaged goods  Overall I love Asiana, my wallet loves it even more. I can by some staple items, lunches for the week and enough fresh meat and produce for 2 large weekend meals for under $40.    The only major improvements I would suggest are to add a small restaurant or two and to devise a system to better organize staples, like sugar, rice, flour, etc.  If you're in the Northwest valley I definitely recommend you stop in and review the place yourself.

JT's is your typical gyro joint menu wise, but they're doing it well and keeping it clean.  I've ordered from JT's on about 12 occasions and haven't been disappointed, so I'll just give a quick rundown on the standouts:  Pita - The bread is great and toasted well, buttery and crisp. Tzatziki - Likely they best I've had from a gyro shop. Gryo - Great, fresh produce. Green leaf lettuce, tasty and never limp tomatoes, onions, etc. Kifta Kebab - Fantastic, the best I've had from this category of restaurant in the valley. Rice - The rice is always tasty, it's cooked and seasoned perfectly with a little dash of smoked paprika to finish Fries - Some of the yelp reviewers pan them, others love them; I'm in the love camp.  Always crispy never greasy in my experience. Service - JT is a friendly guy and the one time they made a slight mistake with my order, he corrected it quickly, gave me a discount and comped a drink and some baklava. Cleanliness - this joint is spotless, as proven by their county inspection record.  Skip the Greek Pita, the Pita Jungle and the other chains, the food here is far tastier and more consistent.  This is my second favorite kebab (gyro) joint in the valley.

This is my favorite fast food style burger joint. I'd fight a (small, tired) dude for their burgers. I've tried them just about every way, but the original double with cheese is best. Onion rings are the real deal, and although I'm not a shoestring fry kind of guy, the fries are always hot, salty and tasty and are perfect for dipping by the fist full in hot sauce (*hot sauce not included).  The deserts are great too, I love their custard. The Hawaiian sundae is a must have. I know, I know, you say you don't like macadamia nuts. I'm not a big fan myself, but frozen macadamias are something completly different than their room temperature counterparts. A crunchy, nutty awesomeness that I've never tasted in anything else.  The service is always great too. One time we did have a bit of a mishap, while in the drive through our shakes came out long before our food. Which obviously meant that they had melted by the time we got home. My wife contacted the manager, who showed genuine concern and was nice enough to issue us a gift certificate of a surprisingly significant denomination, sufficient for a few trips back to the drive through.  Contrary to what Curtis Mayfield has advised, I can assure you that Freddy is most certainly NOT dead.

Dr. Core and his staff are professional, friendly and most important, informative.    The last experience I had with a dentist prior to visiting Legacy Dental Group left a bad taste in my mouth (HA!).  While being examined the dentist and hygienist both ignored me and spoke to each other about me like I wasn't present.  At several points I asked questions, at appropriate breaks in the all-so exciting exam process, about what the terminology they were using meant and I was answered each time with disdain by the hygienist. At the end of the exam I began to ask the dentist questions directly and he cut me off, stating that I need to reserve my questions for the front desk staff.  My experience at Legacy, with Dr. Core and his staff, couldn't have been more different.  They clearly explained each step of each procedure they performed and answered all of my questions. They included me in their conversations and showed the utmost concern for my comfort.   The office is ultra clean and modern which caused my first impression to be that their prices would reflect the overheard of their office.  After my exam they explained and priced my treatment; I took that information home and did some comparison shopping with some of the "bargain" dentist offices in the valley and Legacy's pricing was actually a few dollars less than the lowest quotes I received elsewhere.  I was completed satisfied by my experience with Legacy Dental and will be returning.

I work near Ray's and it is my go-to spot for good, quick and cheap eats.  I usually go for the daily lunch slice special.  Around lunch hours they have several slice options (cheese, pepperoni and sausage) par-cooked and waiting, with some other variations and varieties thrown in.  The white pizza if very good and the pesto is the best I've had in the valley.  Just pick your slice/s and they'll throw them in the oven for a minute or two to finish them. They often have slices of Sicilian pizza too. If it's available be sure to snag some, the crust is excellent.   I've only ventured away from the pizza once, to get a cheese steak and it too was solid; shaved rib-eye and good, salty Provolone.  I've never had any issues with the service, it has always been prompt and friendly.  As far as pie goes, you can't go wrong with Ray's.

I rate this place a 3.5. My wife and I eat here often because we love the food, particularly their lamb dishes. The lamb kebabs are terrific and the lamb tikka masala is one of the tastiest dishes I've had anywhere. They make great naan (the chile and potato varieties are the real standouts). The onion bhaji is also a must.  A word of caution: Stay away Friday and Saturday nights if you don't like belly dancing. Having some proto-stripper clang loud-@$$ zills (finger symbols) in my ear while I try to eat does nothing for me...nothing good at least. Also, belly dancing is of Mid-Eastern origin so I have no idea why it would be featured at an Indian Restaurant. If I wanted to watch a stripper, I'd prefer to do so the old fashioned way. At a club of ill repute, in the dark, where the staff and I can both veil our combined sense humiliation and degradation. Also be on the lookout for the owner. Be prepared for endless conversation if he's there and drinking.  I'll will be returning to Tandoori Times often, but I'll be hiding out, averting my eyes and leaving my handful of singles at home!

I've been here once but I'm willing to give it a 4.5-5.0 rating. The food and service were both excellent.  Although they are the torta kings, I had the King Steak Tacos and they were perfect. I do know if they're making their own corn tortillas, but it doesn't matter because you're not going to find much better. They used skirt or flank steak and they wisely cut it against the grain. It was super tender and perfectly marinated. They topped the tacos with grilled jalapenos and onions, with a bit of fresh cilantro. No BS shredded cabbage or other whack gringo-garnish. All the tacos come with rice, which I could just sit and eat for a full day. Hands down the best Mexican rice I've had in this country.  This is simply central Mexican fare at its best, served in a family atmosphere. I can't wait to try the tortas!

Los Reyes has seemingly gained its reputation for good reason. I had the King Steak tacos and they were awesome and their rice may be the very best I've had in the valley. I've still only had one opportunity eat here but I can't wait to get back and put the tortas to the test!

It's a chain but a good one. It's been at this location for a long time now, they're still thriving, and it's all for good reason.  There are a lot of great options here but some of my favorites are the catfish po' boy, fried alligator and crawfish boil. One must try appetizer are the saut√©ed frog legs. If you haven't had frog legs before this is a good place to try them.   They've got great atmosphere indoors, a great patio that typically features live music and the service is always fantastic. A fine choice for lunch ,dinner, drinks or all of the above.

No reason to spin a yarn. Unbeatable prices and selection. The only drawback is that the aisles can be a bit of a tight squeeze, but it's because of their huge inventory so it's forgivable.

This was my second visit here; I bought my son for his first sushi experience. Although it's located in a shopping center, the decor is nice, Japanese themed of course.  For both my visits here I ordered off of the sushi menu; various rolls and negiri, and on each occasion the fish was very good. The service has always been prompt and friendly as well.   They regularly post sake-bomber specials, and although I haven't partaken in such (at this establishment at least) it appears they gladly cater to the boozy crowd. So if you're looking for some Kanpai camaraderie this is likely your place post dinner hours. If you're looking to bring some young ones (no, not Mike, Rick, Vyvyan or Neil - I mean your children) the lunch hour would likely be best.

Our friends took us here for lunch recently and the wife and I were very impressed. I'd totally tell ya'll about the great things we had here, but the menu was in Bosnian so our friends ordered for us.   The bottom line is the food was terrific. We had a great assortment of breads stuffed with meats and cheeses, accompanied with sour cream, tomatoes and onions. Beef sausages and an awesome bean soup with smoked beef.   It's a great,clean family style restaurant that is also a full service bakery and Bosnian market. When you stop in you have to get the Fanta Shokata. It's elderberry and lemon flavored and it is FANTA-stic. If you don't speak Bosnian I recommend you just stop in and ask what's good, grab a Shokata and enjoy some great food.

To date I've only tried Nam Sao a few times but I'm very impressed. I've had the Pho Ga and Pho Tai (chicken and beef pho, respectively), beef fried rice as well as a few appetizers and I've loved everything.    I've taken out each time and was quite pleased with the portion sizes, the price and the manner in which the take out items were boxed.  In regard to the pho, the broth is in an insulated container and the accoutrements (rice noodles, bean sprouts, Thai basil, chili peppers and hot sauce) were all packed separately, to be added when you get home.  Doing so prevents the produce and noodles from becoming waterlogged, making for a very fresh taste even if you have a bit of a drive ahead of you. The fried rice was better than any Chinese joint I've ever experienced and the spring rolls were crispy with fresh ingredients.  The service is warm and welcoming.  If you got a craving for pho, this is the place. I'll know I'll be returning often!

This particular location is a major disappointment. I work nearby so I've given it several chances, as I love Japanese and have had good experiences at the Bell road location.  I've been here 6 or 7 times and have had worse than poor service each visit.  I've never had a drink refilled, I've never received my food in less than 35 minutes, and I've never had anything other than marginal sushi.  I have many friends that have given this location a go as well and they all had the same experience.    There's not much else to say.  If you're thinking of eating here, give it a pass and hit up the original Bell road location.  The last time I was there the service and food were both great.

Good food all around but the best feature of this restaurant are their combination specials. For around eight bucks you get two entrees with hot and sour or egg drop soup, vegetable fried rice, an egg roll, two crab puffs and two fried shrimp.  The owner, Monita, seemingly takes great pride in her restaurant and the quality of service she provides. The only thing that this place is missing is delivery service.

There's nothing I can say about FnB that hasn't been said already, so I won't even try.  I can only add that the 5 star ratings are legit and nowhere near an overstatement.  You are NOT going to find better food in the valley, prepared as lovingly, with such attentive service.    FnB does everything right and if you haven't been you're missing one of the finest points of the valley dining scene.  Stop reading and make a reservation now - while you still can - or CAN YOU?    Too late, it's too popular!

This place seems to be everything you'd want in your neighborhood coffee joint. I've only been once and I had an iced mocha (yeah, that's right). The coffee was delicious and to top it off, literally, the whipped cream (yeah, that's right) was infused with espresso.   The atmosphere caters to the downtown hipster, wifi set. Which is smart 'cause if you've got fast throughput and good joe they'll lurk and linger in droves, doling our ducats all the while. It probably rates a five star review but I just did a hit and run.

Maybe the best chicken Parmesan sandwich in the valley. That's literally all you need to know. You can get very good sandwiches here, for certain, and their breakfast burritos are awesome...but if you're here for lunch just get the chicken parm, then come back and get it again.

With 234 reviews (and counting) there's no need for me to go into great detail. I'll just add to the weighted score. This place lives up to the hype, so get at it!

If you're looking for authentic, family style Middle Eastern food and market, I think you're going to have a hard time finding better than The Olive Tree.  It's run by a Jordanian family that couldn't be nicer or more on top of their food game.  They're making cheeses, curing olives, baking baklava...all the good stuff you want from a specialty market.  The market itself is clean, well stocked and appears to have solid turnaround on their products.  The grill can't be beat...the best kebab I've had (in the US).  Everything is super fresh and made to order.  The tabouli is awesome! Get the combo plate - choice of any three meats with basmati rice, salad, pita and garlic sauce.  The breakfast options are great too, for all you early birds.   Stop searching for good Greek/Mid-East/Kebab, you've found the right place!

Yay! I've finally got a local Chinese joint again. After a hit and miss journey New York Wok has become my go-to spot for Chinese American delivery.  It's all been very good here, but I'm a freak for their egg rolls, mei fun and chow fun. If you haven't had mei or chow fun before you have to try it here. However their most killer-est dish is the roast pork lo mein. I'm typically disappointed by pork dishes from AZ Chinese restaurants; regardless of the dish the pork is usually bland and/or dry. That's not the case here, the pork is seasoned and roasted well. Spicy beef it a close runner up to the pork lo mein (and is really done justice by a night in the fridge), so be sure to hit some up as well.  I've only taken out or had delivery to date, so I can't speak to the wait staff but the counter and delivery service has always been prompt and friendly.

I've been going to Joey's since they opened the Happy Valley location and have nothing but good things to say.  I've only bounced around the menu a bit because I've been so pleased with what has become my "usual".  What's the usual? It's this, and you should get it just like this...right now!  1. Italian Beef/Italian Sausage combo sandwich (don't go crying about calories...go big or stay home!) with hot AND sweet peppers, wet. 2. Pizza puff 3. Cheese fries (what did I say about the calories???)  Then put a fork in yourself...you're done for the day.

I'm upgrading Joey's from 4 stars to 5.  My reasons are myriad:  -The service is always exceptional. This is not hyperbole, go there and you'll see for yourself.  -They are going the extra mile to provide value, and then some.  From their deep discounts frequently available through the Groupon/Deal Chicken type resellers, Facebook/Email/SMS fan club to their discount stamp card that they'll combine with their other offers  -They are going the extra mile to improve the quality food.  They recently invited those in their SMS/email fan club to a taste test of many new products they were considering, allowing their patrons to choose the products they serve.  Oh, and the firedogs are a new favorite.  Totally an addiction at the moment.

The Greek Pita is my choice for kebab when I don't have the time for The Olive Tree Mediterranean Market (it's more fast food oriented).  To date I've only ordered the Kefta kebab, plate and sandwich, and the fish and chips.  All have been very good, but my recommendation would be the Kefta sandwich.  Be sure to ask for the Greek hot sauce, it's fantastic.

I was excited about the prospect of Ali Baba's. It's owned by the same folks who run Open Sesame Market, right next door. The market sells great products so I figured they should serve them well too. However that's not the case.  We ordered the lamb kebab and beef shawarma plates, the appetizer trio (choice of humus or babaganouj, falafel and dolmas) and fries. The fries were underdone and over seasoned. The lamb and beef were seasoned fairly well but were overdone. The dolmas were bland, the falafel was pretty tasty but, get this...no humus or babaganouj. They ran out! I'd go back to a joint just for the humus if it was good enough. You can't run a middle Eastern restaurant and run out of humus, it simply isn't done. The food is dirt cheap, I can give them that, and the service was excellent. Those were the only bright spots of the experience.  I definitely recommend a visit to Open Sesame Market but if you're hungry do yourself a favor, head across the street and hit up J.T. Gryos. He sources his stuff from Kronos Foods, but Kronos ain't bad at all and J.T. really knows how to slang it.

I popped in here the other weekend. I had just gotten back from a city renowned for its coffee and was looking for a decent latte.  This is a very nice, family run joint with some tasty looking treats. All I can speak to was the lemon bar and coffee that I consumed in a flash, and I can attest that both were quite good. Drop by if you're in the area, this seems to be a great local business that deserves the support of the community they service.

I frequently shop at Asiana on 43rd & Union Hills, so I was glad to see a new Asian market opening in the neighborhood. I stopped in a few weeks back and was not disappointed. The obvious standout here is the seafood counter. The entire store is impeccably clean but the seafood counter is immaculate. They carry a large variety of seafood and all of it appeared quite fresh. No odd fishy odors, which is always a good sign.  The store is smaller than Asiana, so they don't carry quite as large a variety of products. In particular they don't have an abundance of Indian products, but they do carry Gup Shup peanuts so that's enough right there to keep me coming back...oh, and the ice. A 20 pound bag of ice is always a must in my house (even if it is Reddy ice - Boo!).  A great produce section too, with all the items that a good Asian market should have and more. It's good to see a little competition in the neighborhood, and it appears to be working. Asiana's prices seem to have come down a little and it looks like they're trying to clean up their store a bit as well - hooray me!
