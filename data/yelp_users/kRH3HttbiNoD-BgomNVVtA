This place was uber cool. I grew up 10 mins from the Mexican border so I was fortunate to grow up with authentic Mexican food- from restaurants and taco stands to my friends Nana making homemade tortillas and rice and beans and well, everything.   We were in the mood for carne asada tacos to grill at home and decided to buy some meat here instead of food city or the carneceria up the street. I heard about the hype and great reviews but never got around to checking it out.   This place rocks! 100% authentic and has everything I need to make virtually any Mexican dish I can remember.   The place is so cool. I can't get over it. Bakery, deli, tortilla factory, cheeses, meats, seafood, veggies, spices and candy. It has it all. It's pretty much the Mexican version of Lee Lee's, only cooler looking and more fun.   Check it out.

Best tortillas in Arizona, not just Phoenix!!! Large, Fresh and sooo tasty. Reminds me of how my best friends' nana used to make. The beans are very tasty and love all the different burrito variations. You can't go wrong here.

BEST mexican food in the valley. Beans are the BEST. Enchilada's &amp; Tacos are the BEST. Pollo Fundido is very very tasty. I usually stick to my usual routine: the "Muchas Cosas" plate: cheese enchilada, folded taco (i always get beef), bean tostada, beans, rice &amp; a flower tortilla. You can't beat it. I LOVE this place. My only complaint, not really a complaint, just a preference, is that I love the FLAVOR of the salsa, but prefer chunkier salsa w/ fresh cilantro. But the salsa they have is GREAT in folded tacos. The chips are good, but i prefer thicker chips, but again, thats just a preference.  They are ALWAYS busy, so get there early (or wait til later to go). They have a take-out window if your in a hurry. Don't even worry about the neighborhood. We just moved near south Phoenix from Chandler, and its fine. The ambiance inside is awesome and the hostess is very friendly.   You just can't go wrong here. A++++ food!

Great selection of asian and other country foods & ingredients. I've never tried any of the meat or fish there, but have taken home quite alot of veggies, candy, snacks, & condiments. The staff isnt overly friendly, matter of fact, its hard to usually get them to even crack a smile. But I don't mind. The store is pretty clean (even though it smells like fish, lol), and they have TONS of items in stock. Prices are reasonable for the most part. I wish there was one closer to me in Phoenix though.

Solid pizza! Great prices and the HUGE 24" pizza is great for parties or, should I call it now... the 2010 SUPERBOWL PARTY feat OUR AZ CARDINALS!!! (one can only hope). Last superbowl, i ordered (2) of the party pizza's, and it was more than enough for 10 people.   The toppings are fresh, and the dough is excellent. The cheese and sauce are both above average.  After rennovating the interior, this place went from college late-night hang out, to modern semi-upscale establishment.   The employees are still friendly and the pizza, still excellent. Wings get a 7/10 on my scale. pretty dang good.

Great dogs here! Best dogs I've had in the Phoenix area. Love their fries too. Always fast and friendly service. So happy they accept debit/credit cards now as they used to be cash only. Very reasonable prices as well. They never disappoint.

Great beers! Four Peaks is my brewery of choice. The Kilt Lifter is my fav. Food is slightly on the pricey side, but good. If you don't know which beer to go with, try the sampler.   The service is great, staff is friendly and the crowd is laid back and chill. Its so refreshing to find a place thats not trying to bring in the snottsdale 'bros' and materialistic women.  I LOVE the patio out front when the weather is nice, but the inside has more than enough room.  Can't say enough about this place. My favorite watering hole.

Simply the best there is. From their hummus (the jalapeno-cilantro one is my fav), to the chicken pasta (my wife's fav) to the falafel or gyro's... you can't go wrong. Great service, chill atmosphere, decent prices and... the food.... AMAZING. I don't know why I don't go here more often. And I've frequented alot of them (the one on Apache, Ray Rd in Chandler & Ahwatukee)... They are often busy, especially weekends, but its well worth it. I like the diverse crowd too... its not like its JUST a haven for yogi's & hippies, which is nice. Nothing worse than feeling out of place, and this place, doesnt do that at all.

Arguably the best, freshest burgers in town. Staff is always friendly and food is always good. Probably my only complaint is that it's pretty small inside- but hey, the small cozy wooden ambiance is what adds to the experience. Tastes like burgers at at back-yard BBQ.

Great place! Much more knowledgeable staff and better prices than Leslies. Our pool cleaner stopped working, literally, on the bottom of our pool. We took it into Leslies and they said that everything looked good and for us to check our hoses for leaks and if there aren't any, to check our pool pump to make sure its working correctly. Lastly, if both seem fine, then they suggested we have the lines cleared out because maybe there are debris causing the pump/cleaner to not suck enough water to move it about.  Did what he said, checked everything, and everything seemed fine. Called a few pool companies around the valley, but none serviced my area. This ended up being a good thing, because we probably saved money in the end. We decided to take our pool cleaner into B&B and they said they would take care of it, took our name & number, and our pool cleaner and said it would be ready by the following day. It was and the cost to fix it was MUCH less than we thought. Approx $60 to replace some parts on the machine. We were expecting over $100. Shoot, a 'service call' fee from the local pool service companies would of been about $50 alone.  We took the cleaner back home and it worked like new.   Great service, prices and most of all, KNOWLEDGEABLE staff. That can't be said enough.

Love it, love it, love it!!!! Just.... not the space. SO small and always packed results in either a long wait or us leaving to find a different place to eat. However, the food and service is always excellent. If you've never had a pasty before, you need to go and try one. They are very filling and every different kind I've tried, has been excellent. If you don't know what it is, think of it as like a larger, tastier & fresher hot pocket. I normally stick with "The Oggie", "Bangers & Mash" or "Cottage Pie". All 3 are excellent. I also request an extra side of their red wine gravy. Its amazing!  Don't be scared off when you walk in to find dark walls, dim light and rock music playing. Nor the servers & chef's with tattoos and piercings... because you could easily miss out on one hell of a meal.  (I'd like to add that if you want to avoid the small, dark space with limited seating, you can always try out their other location off Dobson & Guadalupe).

It's ok if your hungry but taco bell tastes better. It's a buffet, so don't expect the best. Beans are dry and taste like they came from a can. Rice is bland. Enchiladas are gross. Sadly the best thing they offer is the sopapillas at the end. Drizzle with honey and your in heaven. For the price and amount of food you can get, it's ok. But if you want flavorful authentic Mexican food, keep on driving.   Also, a bit of warning. Both me and my roommate at the time, both ended up with upset stomachs after eating here. Did we eat too much? Its possible. Was it the food? probable.  Note: Please don't mistake this BUFFET place for the authentic, sit-down restaurant on Central Ave in south Phoenix. Ponchos in South Phoenix has excellent, authentic and really tasty 'home-cooked' style food.  This buffet place? Well, again, think of Taco Bell, cafeteria style.  While its not HORRIBLE, its not very good. Save your money.

Yeah, it's a chain outta So-Cal.  Yeah it's kinda similar to Baja Fresh.   But the original fish tacos rock.  Perfectly fried- beer battered fish. Fresh cabbage. And the white sauce is amazing.   Beans, rice and salsa are good too. And the staff is friendly and the restaurant is always clean.

Great pizza. The dough they use is excellent. Apparently they alter/filter the water they use to make the dough to resemble that of New York city tap water. The result is great!! Ingredients are fresh, sauce is tasty. Overall, NYPD ranks a top 5 pizza place in the valley in my book. The service for the most part is great. On busy nights, it can be a tad on the slow side, but that goes for any restaurant. I've been to both the Chandler & Scottsdale Rd locations, and love them both. The Scottsdale location I like slightly more, just due to the 2nd story seating. Fun place and great eats.

Pei Wei is like a fast-food version of PF Changs (same owner/recipes). There is something that is a MUST for anybody trying Pei Wei for the first time: Lettuce Wraps.  Absolutely worth the trip alone. I normally get this for myself as my entree, and my fiance likes the Honey Chicken. Both are excellent. I've also tried the Pad Thai, and it was just 'ok'. The dumplings were above average, but as stated, the thing to get is the Lettuce Wraps.  For a chain, its pretty good. The food has always been hot and fresh and flavors are great. I LOVE their Ice Tea as well. Service is always fast and courteous.

We recently moved to the area and actually bought our first home in the neighborhood behind Amanos. We decided to celebrate our purchase by walking to the resturant. The ambiance is cool, cozy. Waitress was friendly and helpful. The prices are slightly higher than they should be, but the quality and taste if the food makes up for it. Great wines, great pizzas. I recommend the large pizza on semenoia crust for 2. The cherry tomatoes are fresh and wonderful. We try to dine here at least once a month.

Excellent Boba's! I always get the Taro flavor wherever I go, and this place makes it the best! Perfectly blended with great boba. The staff is young, but very friendly and the service is always quick. Sucks that its far away from me now that I moved to PHX, but nonetheless, when I'm stocking up on Asian groceries from Lee Lee's, I always make sure to stop in. Especially during the summer. So refreshing!

Excellent pizza! It lives up to the hype! To rank my top 3 pizzerias in the PHX metro area is as follows: 1) Grimaldis 2) Rosatis 3) NYPD (actually- just as good as Rosatis, IMO, just differently made and I like them for different reasons. Cibo & Pizzeria Bianco are tied for 4th in my book.   The dough at Grimaldis is excellent. Airy and crispy and not burnt on the bottom. Cheese is really tasty and is laid down as thin slices, not shredded like most pizza places. The pepperoni and sausage were very flavorful and juicy. The sauce was not too sweet nor tart. Perfect balance. Too bad this place is soo far away or I'd visit more often.   Service was great and you can't leave without trying their famous canolis at the end. Came across these bad boys at a wedding convention and was sold. Even better straight from the restaurant.   A+. I will be back. You can keep your 3 hour wait at Bianco.

Best pizza in phoenix to date. It stinks this location doesn't have dine in, but its ok. My fav? The "classic combo" on thin crust. If you don't like this and the flavors don't explode in your mouth, I'm at a loss for words. The absolute best pizza money can buy. I have NO problem paying $20+ for a large combo pizza when the end result is this. I can't get over how amazing it is.  They are pretty busy so make your to-go or delivery orders early. The staff is really nice, even when they are super busy. On each pizza box, they have coupons you cut-out. Save 12 of those up, and you get 50% off any pizza of your choice.  The wings are also excellent.  A+

Some of the best cheesesteaks i've had. Should of went with the more popular original (steak & cheese whiz), but instead, tried it with my fav, provolone. While the meat and chesse tasted really good, the overall finish was somewhat dry. Probably my only drawback since all my cheesesteak consisted of was bread + steak + provolone cheese. I'm going back because the fries were some of the best I've had. The service was very friendly. My fiance ordered the kids meal (she wanted the grilled cheese) and said it was really good. Portions are right on, a little too much actually. I got the regular and couldnt finish it. But when I go back, I'm going to try the Steak 'wit cheez'.   A- vote.  01/11/2010 UPDATE: I've been back and tried the original (steak with cheese whiz). Oh my! Now THIS is what I'm talking about!!! Best cheesesteak I've ever had outside of Philly.  A+  Also- the employees are still as nice as the 1st time. GREAT service, arguably in the top 3 in all of the Phoenix metro. I've been there 6 times to date and haven't been disappointed.  Also- I must add that their 'fry sauce', whatever mysterious blend of tastebud utopia, is amazing. I don't know what it is, but I love that stuff. Far better than regular ketchup. Also- their fries are ALWAYS cooked to perfection. I've yet to have soggy fries nor old, stale fries.   LOVE THIS PLACE.  (request to owners- if you can, please open up a new location. maybe Tempe Marketplace?? you guys are leaps and bounds better than the Great Steak Escape or whatever they are called).

Can't even compete with YC's. Sauces were either blah or strange tasting and overall, just not very good. Its edible, just not as enjoyable.

Wow! This place was REALLY good Thai food! As usual, I will always base my experience on my go-to dish: Pad Thai. This place did not miss! It was very tasty and fresh and the service was excellent. The prices are acceptable, but they do have some lunch specials that we happened to just miss during our visit. The portions are large and again, the flavors were excellent. Both myself and my wife enjoyed ourselves and will return soon.

Its a chain, but its good (keep in mind, this review encompasses ALL different Chipotle locations- not just this one on Baseline). I absolutely LOVE the barbacoa (marinated & shredded beef). The flavor is superb. I normally get the barbacoa tacos, cuz I can't get enough of the flavor, and its just amazing. Once, I decided to try a combo of all 3 meats: barbacoa, chicken, & carne asada (steak). The Carne Asada was my least favorite, sadly. (I'm a HUGE fan of carne asada). Maybe I just tried it on an off-day, but just wasn't good. The chicken was pretty tasty, so one day I decided to sway away from my usual 3-soft taco barbacoa plate, and go for the chicken burrito.  Yummy. It was excellent. I love how you can pick and choose what goes into your burrito/tacos.... For the chicken burrito? I chose rice, black beans, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole (it costs extra) and their medium salsa. Excellent stuff.  Cant go wrong. Its always fast, fresh and tasty. Again, its a chain, but that doesnt take away from the quality of food. Matter of fact, being a chain, and being so tasty and consistent, should be a reason to go.

We just stopped in earlier today to try to cool off from the heat. We missed the 'free smoothie' by a day (yesterday 6/15/12 was National Flipflop Day, apparently), but nonetheless we wanted to break away from our usual stop- Jamba Juice, and give this place a try. I've driven past it before as its near my old work as well as one of the best Philly cheesesteaks in the valley (Forefathers), but just never got around to stopping in.  The one thing I really liked is that, as opposed to Jamba Juice, they ACTUALLY have food! Not just pretzels! They have sandwiches, flatbread & wraps, amongst other items. However, we ate a couple hours earlier so we just came for the smoothies.   We walked into your typical 'Hawaiian' ambiance, but at least it was clean and not OVERLY cheesy. The place was empty and we were instantly greeted as we walked in. The employee was very friendly and helpful. My wife got the Blue Lagoon and I got the Silky Peach (or something like that). Both were good, but I liked my wife's a little more. I didn't see if they had any 'free throw-ins' like they do at Jamba Juice, nor were we offered any, so I'm assuming they don't. They had some free samples of a peanut butter smoothie and flatbread sandwich on the counter, which we tried while we waited. Both were really good.   I'll have to go back when I'm hungry to try the food, but the smoothies were definitely on-par to that of Jamba Juice.

My mom was in town, and wanted to see where a relative got married a few months back, so I showed her The Waterfront. Next door, she noticed a restaurant, Pier 54. She mentioned she'd like to try that out for lunch before she left. So we did.  Service: Bad. We arrived around 11:40, 40 minutes after they opened. We walked onto the patio/deck, and didn't see a server at all, so we just sat ourselves. After a good 15 minutes, a waiter walked out and took our drink order. Another 10 minutes, drinks arrived, and we decided to place our order then. We didn't receive our food for another 20 minutes or so. We didn't mind TOO much, since it was a nice day and we had a nice view of the man-made lake.  Food: I ordered the Fish & Chips and both were pretty good. Sadly, the fries were probably the best item we tasted. My Fiance had the regular burger & fries, and her burger was over-cooked and very dry and lacked flavor. My fish, was battered to perfection, although, the middle of the fish (most dense area), was cooked, but the consistency was different from the fish on the outer edges. Kinda mushy and not as appetizing. I enjoyed the ends and outer edges of the fillet of fish the most. My mom had the 1/2 sandwich & soup- roast beef panini & clam chowder. I took a bite of the panini, nothing special. Not gross, but not GREAT. its just ok. The clam chowder had a great flavor, but was awfully runny and thin and not as thick as most chowders. There wasn't many items: potatoes, clams, etc in there either. I was mostly a thin chowder broth.  In the end, I don't think we'll be back. Great location and nice atmosphere (minus the annoying bird that kept squawking all day long), but it was nice to enjoy the weather, the view and the ducks in the lake). I dont know why the service was soo slow, on a sunday, with only 3-4 tables. (more arrived as we left, but we were still shocked by the slow speed of the waiter). He was friendly, so I give him that, but we were really looking forward to this place, and it let us down quite a bit.  If you dont' mind slow service and can use a very laid-back atmosphere, then you'd like it. The food was passable, but nothing to drool over.

What happened? I had Ono's at a different location and it was decent. This location? Horrible. First off, the staff consists of ghetto high school kids with attitudes and no smiles or even a personality. The chicken, on 2 seperate occasions, was REALLY fatty. You find yourself spending most of the time picking off the fat than eating. The rice wasnt cooked correctly one visit. The flavors of some of their sauces are ok, but that wont get me to go back. Especially when Chiptole is a few doors down. And especially when its vastly overpriced. Good portions, but too bad most is inedible.

Jim was great! Our water heater went out and he was able to come out the next day to install a new one. He was nice,  professional and best of all,  he didn't try to add on additional fees or try to upsale me. He was able to quote me on the phone with no strings attached. He was in and out within an hour and a half and now I have hot water. Support this guy! He knows what he's doing and it's always nice to support "the little guy" instead of these huge companies that just screw you over. Not to mention, he was about $300 less than what others quoted me. While I hope I won't have to deal with a broken water heater again, at least I know who I can call should I need to. Thanks Jim!

Great food and friendly servers. I think I even met the owner a couple times. Everybody is super nice. I absolutely LOVE the chips & salsa. The salsa is made fresh daily, and is usually a bit different every time you go. Not different in a bad way, just different. More chunky, less chunky. More spicy, more sweet, etc. The tacos are great, especially the barbacoa taco! My fav!   The ambiance is on the modern side with club/down tempo music playing on occasion, but nothing too loud or obnoxious. Its a small place, so don't expect to cram a party of 30 in there anytime soon.   The prices are decent, mixed drinks are a bit on the stiff side, but at least you get your money's worth, right?

Eh- it was just ok. I was told about the must-have Cajun fries, and they were just ok. Not spicy at all and appeared to be just like Cajun season salt sprinkled on regular fries. The fries were Kinda soggy and very greasy. Burger was ok. Tasted fresh, but I didn't know a "regular" burger was 2 patties. Yuck.   Sadly- my favorite thing about this place was the fact they had Mello Yello. Sweet.   It's good enough to eat- but it's no where near the quality of Chuckbox which is right up the street. Shoot- fatburger a stones throw away is better.   Its good enough to eat again if your friends wanna go, but its not a place that i'll be craving or want to search for parking to eat at.  Oh well.

Called them on a Wednesday when our garage wasn't opening. The chain was hanging a little and center beam seemed warped a little. Because I live in South Phoenix where they are located, they arrived to my house within an hour of calling. Gabriel showed up and was very nice and professional. He explained to me what was wrong,  and quoted me a very good price without trying to up sell me. He also lubed and tuned up track /wheels etc,  free of charge. Plus the parts he had to replace cane with a 1 year warranty that I wasn't even expecting. He was done within 30 minutes and our garage works again (and is more quiet now). Thanks Gabriel!! I'd definitely use him again.
