I've been here several times now (all for breakfast) so this review does not cover their lunch or dinner offerings.  Pros: Staff have all been very friendly and helpful. (Always a plus) Haven't had to ask for more coffee yet. They have been pretty good about anticipating the need for a "top off" Awesome muffins! I'm a bran muffin fan (I know... I know...) and I really enjoyed theirs. Blueberry muffin was great also Lots of breakfast options, from french toast, pancakes, waffles and omelettes to multiple types of quiche as well as a few different eggs benedict options, and crepes. Also has a lighter menu with less fat and more fresh fruit options.  Cons: A little more expensive than your usual breakfast place, but not by much. Bad experience with their cinnamon brioche roll. Came out dry and stale, and not nearly as warm as I'd have liked.  Although some might find it a little over the top. I love the faux-french decor, signs, and other little accouterments to be a nice touch, so plus points from me for the ambiance. To sum up, I like this place quite a bit... and would definitely consider becoming a regular customer.

A good selection of coffee and tea, as well as fresh pastries and generally an assortment of sandwiches and wraps (although quantity may vary by time of day). This place is definitely packed with local students, some getting there as soon as it opens to get one of the coveted 4-seater tables with outlets. There's still room in "The Vault" though if all of the main tables are taken.   The staff is pretty friendly once you get to know them, there tends to be live music from time to time (usually have a schedule up on the main counter) and the music piped in over the PA system can range from classic rock, to reggae, to psy trance, to Japanese "J-Rock".   Plenty of seating for smokers in a sheltered outside area. Bathrooms are separate from the main area, across the smoker's "hallway" and are usually pretty clean, which is nice. Some wear is evident in the place. Some of the carpet is lose and can be a tripping hazard if they don't have it taped down, some of the chairs and tables in the smoking area are starting to break down a bit, but all in all I like it here and I keep coming back.

First impressions? Student hang-out. Showed up around 7pm, and the interior was filled with students and their laptops, availing themselves of the free WiFi. Lots of options for both coffee and tea drinkers, especially if you have a sweet tooth. Our barista pointed out some of their candy bar themed coffee drinks, and there were easily a dozen or more. Ample outdoor seating with a smoking area for those who care to mix vices. All in all, not a bad spot, and I'm looking forward to going back and trying out their selection of baked goods as well.

Pros: A decent number of selections to choose from Many familiar choices (if you've been to a Chinese buffet before. Hand-scooped icecream in multiple varieties is a nice touch. I'm soooo tired of soft-serve machines.  Cons: The pitfalls that plague most Chinese buffets... food sits in steam table trays for far too long and gets dry and unpleasant looking if you're not there at a peak-hour when food is being constantly replaced. Unfortunately, the one time I was there during what I'd consider to be "peak dining" (around 6:30-7:00pm) it was still a similar issue. Mostly, I'd say this was due to the lack of customers.  I was also not overly impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant. It has a somewhat dingy look to it. Probably due to the age of the location  To sum up: As a Chinese restaurant, I would not make this my first choice. As a Chinese buffet, I've had both better and worse. Much worse. I would consider going back, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

Never thought I'd encounter a hole-in-the-wall Scandinavian restaurant, but that's exactly what Beaver Choice is. Situated between a hair salon and a dollar store, this newly-opened restaurant offers up traditional Scandinavian dishes as well as pitas, wraps, burgers and salads. Everything from their gravad lax (cured salmon) to their k√∂ttbullar (better known as 'Swedish meatballs') is made from scratch. The family that owns and runs the restaurant is super friendly, and really make the place inviting. A few things to note, however. The service is not quite what you'd expect, and may catch some off guard. While they are quick to bring you anything you ask for, (extra silverware, a drink refill, etc) they will otherwise generally leave you undisturbed during your meal, as they don't wish to interrupt your dining with a lot of "and how is everything tonight?" and things of that nature. Same goes with the check. There's no waiter dropping it off saying "Whenever you're ready, I'll be your cashier". It's expected that when you feel like leaving (and there's no rush) you'll just go up to the register and pay for your meal. That said, I'm definitely going to go back again, and soon.
