Great pizza! Great service! We called ahead and placed an order so it would be ready when we drove through town on our way to Vegas, it was ready right on time. We will be back. It is a small joint and without gps might have missed it.

I have had a horrible experience with Dr. Amiri Harari.  He almost sent me to an early grave.  Thank goodness for patient advocates that followed up with me after an inquiry to NORD and NIH.  Although initially I was grateful Dr. Harari suspected a diagnosis.  He then ordered two tests.  When the tests came back normal he said I did not have the disease.  I said wonderful, what do we do next?  He said there is nothing I can do for you.  I said I have to suffer? He said there is nothing wrong with you, I said so you are just saying I am fat, crazy and lazy?  He said you said it, I didn't.  I have since been diagnosed with Cushings Disease and would have continued to suffer based on his incompetence.  He ordered two tests, one was not even the appropriate test for the disease, the other requires several tests as one in four come back normal.  He did not follow any sort of protocol for diagnosing that particular disease.  His dismissive attitude came after weeks of only having one test result and I called twice to get the results as I suffer every day from this disease. I refuse to pay for the test that does not even meet the endocrine society basic guidelines for that disease.  The advocate said that that is a typical response from unprepared endocrinologist.  She did ask for his name.  I gave it to her in hopes she can send him some educational materials in this matter so he does not do this to another patient.  BEWARE OF DR HARARI
