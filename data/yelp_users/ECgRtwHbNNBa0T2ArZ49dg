Very disappointed! Good service but poor quality sushi!! Tons of sauce on the rolls Iike they were trying to mask the poor quality of fish.

DO NOT COME HERE!! I just spent $26 on a "supreme car wash" the didn't even wipe the dust off my dash!! Hands down the worst car wash I have ever paid for!! My passenger side window has oil smears all over it... Worse now then when I brought it in to be cleaned!! If I could give negative stars I would!! I went back and told the guy hey look at all thus dust still on my dash and dirty window and spots on the outside aaaa we can redo it. Are you freaking kidding me I just spent 45 min waiting and now you're telling me the only thing you can do is re wash it!! I will never give them my business again I recommend you do the same!!

Horrible customer service and over priced. I bought some bcaa's that were recommended to me by the guy there, they wouldn't even dissolve. Taste horrible too, I went to take them back and surprise they have a no return policy. Any company that believe and backs the products they sell should have a 100% guarantee. They will never get my business again! Also the first bcaa's the guy recommend to me had a warning on the label "this product contains chemicals that have been proven to cause cancer in the state or California" wtf? Branch chain amino acids should be a natural supplement?   I don't know how they call themselves a nutrition shop, obviously they only care about there profit margins and not your health or nutrition.

5 stars this place has the best milk shakes in the whole valley!! The burgers and fries are good but the milk shakes are exceptional. The people that work there are very nice too. If you're some what regular they'll remember you. I have recommended them to many friends and family!!!

This place it great a little on the expensive side but they did the best job out of any pet groomers we have taken your dogs to. I love that they have an open area for the dog to hangout and play together rather then putting them in a create in the back. I would recommend them to anyone!!
