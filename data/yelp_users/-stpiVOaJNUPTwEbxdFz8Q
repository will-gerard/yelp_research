Recommend, ordered delivery from here when I was working late and the food was great.  Had orange chicken, egg foo young, egg rolls, and white and brown rice.

Great place to get your hair cut, fun atmosphere, and they have beer.   I've been getting my hair cut from Paul Pace for the last 6 months, he does a great job.

I went here about 8pm during the week.  I really wanted to try this place.  But, I was unable to even swallow the pizza.  Once it touched my lips I was disgusted.  I ended up leaving and eating elsewhere.
