What happened to this place. I have not been here like a year, and everything went down the hill. No more banana bread  First, Bad Service. We stood up for 5 minutes in front of main door while inside was not crowded. Waiter did not bring us a bread. i had to ask twice. Order was slow. I saw our food waited in the counter at least 10 minutes. I was ready to go and pick it up.  Sushi quality was bad. Yakisoba noodle was burned.  Well, I used to go this place alot, but I will never go back again. What happened to Japanese culture - Being fast , efficent and respectful ?  I will never come back, there are lots of nice places in nort phoenix. just go check it out like Tokyo lobby, yen sushi. It will worth a drive, and   SAYANORA Cherry Blossom

It cannot get any better than this my favorite is mix of banana , hazelnut and lemon. It is quality stuff. If you want something better fly to Italy.

Excellent wings. I realized how much I miss this place when I ate horrible chicken wings in San Jose.   It gets crowded Tuesday and Thursday because of special deal on wings, but definetly worth it.   They do not have any Native NewYorker in CA :(

Ahh Memories... I miss here since I moved from Arizona. Literally, best beer you can find in AZ. I went to Germany for training. I  miss Four Peaks :) (Yes even in Germany)  My favorites are Kilt Lifter and Arizona Peach Ale. I can drink a pitcher of Pitch ale myself.  Food : I like veggie pesto pizza a lot. Also, Chicken strip with chipotle sauce is food for late night. They have a good burgers too.

It has been more than 1 year I have not been in Sushi Ken, but I still remember the taste of salmon Kama. It was like my home. This place is amazing. Owners are nice and so hardworking. I will be back one day and will say hajimemashite :)  PS. People who give one or two stars to this place please get california roll from safeway and continue to think that japanese cuisine is only california roll
