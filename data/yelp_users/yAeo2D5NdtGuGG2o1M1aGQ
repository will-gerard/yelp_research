I went here based on the Yelp reviews and from recommendations from my husband's co-workers. I won't be returning. I was already skeptical about coming here because of the multiple Yelp reviews mentioning the security guard in the parking lot and the shady part of town that it's located in.  My husband and I got the shredded beef tacos and enchiladas. The shredded beef was so dry and overcooked that I only ate half my taco and was over it.  The beef enchilada was filled with huge chunks of beef, which were tender but lacking in flavor.  The rice and beans were nothing special.  oh yeah....  the chips they bring out when you arrive come with tiny bowls of salsa that you can barely dip your chips in because of how small and shallow the bowls are.

I go to this store when i need to stock up on my Asian cooking essentials. This store is huge and has food items from around the world, it's an international supermarket. Every aisle is labeled with the country that the food items originate from. I was like a little kid on a field trip during my first visit and just gawked at all the unique items in every aisle. The produce sections rocks. They have just about every kind of fruit and vegetable that exists and at very cheap prices and the quality is always fresh and good. They also have a very good seafood selection.

Pretty good place. I went on a Saturday around 1130 and stood in line for 15 minutes and then sat on the outside patio since it was a nice day.  I ordered the veggie pizza since I seen a wood fired oven with bubbly pizzas coming out.  It was hard to make a menu choice here because everything sounded so good and you could see all the fresh salad fixings and side items in the glass window display. I heard from a lot of people that everything is good here. My pizza was soooo good. The crust was thin and crispy  like I like and it had a lot of yummy roasted veggies on top. I will definitely return soon!

Here is their website where you can view the menu: http://www.teakwoodstavern.com/   We went here because my hubby was craving hot wings and I seen all the good reviews for this place. He ordered the insanity wings and they were some of the hottest he has ever ate and he loved them! We also got the fried zucchini, was was excellent. I got the candlestick carver sandwich and loved it. It was basically a french dip on sourdough with horseradish and green chili made with prime rib and melted cheese.....2 die 4! We will definitely go again for some good grub and brews.

Delicious GIANT bowl of Pho that hit the spot. The herbs and bean sprouts were super fresh. The Pho broth was perfect and there was so much steak that I couldn't finish it all. The crunchy eggrolls were very tasty too! Accompanied with fresh crunchy lettuce and herbs. We finished the meal with their insanely delicious macaron ice cream sandwiches. They are seriously out of this world. Service was great too! You just have to get past the not so pretty exterior because the food is worth it.

I didn't like this place much. After reading all the excellent reviews I decided to go there with my hubby to celebrate my graduation and was disappointed.  I ordered the seafood platter over linguine and my hubby got some chicken with artichoke over linguine platter. The seafood on my platter was mediocre and the linguine was swimming in a oily puddle of bland tasting sauce.  It tasted like plain vegetable oil poured all over the noodles and for $20 I was regretting this choice. My husband's was also alright, his sauce was a bit oily also, but it had a little more flavor than mine. The portions are ridiculously huge also...and I mead ridiculous. It would be very wise to split an entree with someone if you go, but I don't recommend this place and will not return.

Yummy Japanese desserts. I just wish there was more of a selection. I've been here about 4-5 times and each time they have the normal 5-6 offerings. Not sure why they don't have more a variety, I think the majority of their business is from special order cakes or something. I really love their cream pan and hot dog pan. The bread is so airy and delicate. I also like their strawberry shortcake. I ordered one of their strawberry shortcakes for my anniversary and loved it, but it was a bit pricey. Next time I'm going to try their Japanese bread loaves, they look so good and soft.

I was excited they had Thrifty's ice cream, however ours has ice particles on it. Freezer burn maybe? Not sure but didn't seem totally fresh. Plus the joint reeked of Pine-sol.

I hardly ever give 5 stars, but this place definitely deserves it! I just had the best Mexican food at this joint and it was spicy as hell. We had no clue this place cooked everything super spicy, but that's exactly how I love my food so I was super duper happy. They bring you chips and 2 different salsas to start (red chili and salsa verde) and they are both spicy with chunks of chili peppers in them. We told the manager how much we loved the salsas and he went on to tell us how everything they make is from scratch, including the tortillas. I ordered the taco and red chili cheese enchilada platter with rice and beans. I'm a hard critic when it comes to enchiladas and they are super authentic and delicious here! Be warned though: the beans and the red chili sauce are really really really spicy! I wasn't expecting that kind of heat in the beans and I'm definitely paying for it right now as I type, but it was sooooo worth it. I'm a true fan and will definitely return very soon!

Went to Lee's 4 lunch before my shopping trip at Lee Lee's across the street. I read so many good reviews about this place so I had to give it a shot and liked it.  As soon as you enter the place the aroma of freshly baked bread gets your mouth watering. I got the #5 (bbq pork) because the employee told me it was their most ordered sandwich. I really wanted to try the meatball sub but he told me it was an acquired taste and basically talked me out of it. The bread was perfect and fresh. Nice crisp on the outside and moist on the inside with nicely seasoned bbq pork and cilantro, jalapeno slices, and carrot and daikon pickles. I thought for sure that the 10' sandwich would fulfill my hunger, but when I was finished I was longing for more! lol! I really really wanted to try Lee's famous iced coffee but I'm pregnant and didn't want my baby kicking the hell out of my stomach after that espresso kick :) Anyways I recommend this place!

Update: So I returned to try the Asian meatball sandwich and did not like it at all. I love meatballs, but these were lacking in flavor big time. They needed more spices or a sauce on them. I wish the same guy was at the register to talk me out of it again. Also, a friend of mine go the bbq pork sandwich (based on my recommendation) and they totally skimped out on the meat portion. The sandwich had a few little sprinkles of meat here and there, so basically his sandwich consisted of mostly french bread and pickles. He didn't like it and thought I hyped it up...LOL! After my yucky meatball sub I probably won't go back unless I'm in the neighborhood and really craving some good french bread.

Head to Fogo de Chao instead!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place is gross and not worth the price! You will spend a lot at Fogo de Chao too, but the quality and taste is sooooooo much better. My hubby and I tried this place out on a weeknight and we should have known to turn away when we saw only 2 other tables filled in the entire place.  The quality of the meat was so cheap, dry,chewy and tasteless. The salad bar was small compared to Fogo de Chao, but prob the best part of the entire meal and when you go to a Brazilian restaurant it's suppose to be all about the MEAT and the MEAT sucks balls here. Also our waiter was so damn annoying. We noticed they had a giant Brazilian flag and American flag hanging on the wall by the bar and the American flag was all half hanging onto the floor and we asked him if he could fix it since the flag was on the damn ground and he remarked "the owner is right there you can ask him yourself." My hubby and I looked at each other like WTF? so my husband did just that, he walked over to the owner sitting at the bar right next to the flags and asked him to fix the flag and he said sure right away and started fixing it. dumb waiter. Anyways, Don't waste your time or your money here the food is 2 thumbs down.

Yummmmyyy! The pizza is really really good. The crust is cooked perfectly and the sauce is really delicious and toppings were good. Finally I found a good pizza joint in east valley. I tried Oregano's pizza, Boston's, and others and none compare to this place. We also got the fried zucchini, which was not good and won't get it again. The breading was all soggy and mushy. We also got the caesar salad, which had the perfect dressing! The prices were so reasonable too....their small pizza is only $9 and it's the size of a large pizza from Papa John's. We left with 2 huge slices to take home. They also serve classic Italian pasta dishes like Chicken parmesan for $8 or spagetti and meatballs for $6!  We will definitely return to this pizza joint again and again.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been here about 5 times already and I've only lived here for 4 months. Everytime I visit it is more and more crowded...maybe word is getting around about their fabulous food. My mother is Japanese, so I know what good authentic Japanese food is and they have it here. I absolutely love the chasu ramen (hot beef broth soup with noodles and thinly sliced roast pork), it is soooo good. I also highly highly recommend their sashimi platter- the fish melts in your mouth and is so fresh! They don't skimp on their sashimi slices either...expect 1 1/2 inch thick slices! And the bonus is that the sushi chefs are from Japan and the owner are as well! True and delicious Japanese cuisine! They have all your typical traditional entrees: sushi, sashimi, ramen, udon, soba, pork kontatsu, curry rice, fried rice, broiled sama, gyoza, katsu-don, tempura....to name a few.

Wow I had a fun time reading all the reviews on here about this place. It sounds like some of you have had a really rough time during your visits. I've been here 3 times and must have lucked out because fortunately I never encountered aggressive dogs. If however during my visits I witness this behavior I will gladly walk up to the owner and ask them politely to leave. That is one thing I can't stand is a dumb ass bringing their aggressive dog to a dog park. When their mean dogs act up you can always count on their owners saying outloud, "he/she never acts like this, I don't know what's got into him/her." BULLSHIT.  My one complaint about this place is that I did notice crap here and there and you shouldn't see this in this park because there are plenty of trash bins and an abundant supply of clean up bags. BUt you know there will always be those people that ruin it for the rest of us. I think this place rocks though cuz there is a freakin lake for the dogs to swim! And I love how the entire lake area is covered with pebbles so your dogs feet don't get all muddy. I have 2 little pugs and they love to get in the water with all the big dogs and run around. I don't have any kids yet, but I don't see the harm in people bringing their rugrats as long as they keep an eye on them and prevent them from being trampled by the dogs.

I love this small mom and pop restaurant owned by actual Japanese! Right when you enter the place they have a glass encased display of a lot of their dishes just like they have in Japan. There are a lot of traditional Japanese dishes here in addition to sushi. They have very cool specials everyday and they are listed on their website. We went on a Sunday which is 50% off selected appetizers and sushi roll deals. There were a lot of appetizers to choose from for the special and we got the fried baby calamari on salad with spicy ponzu dressing ($3)and it was soooo good! We also got seaweed salad which was good and only $2.25! I got the combination dinner which included shrimp &veggie tempura and sashimi and it was all excellent and the fish was so fresh and melted in my mouth. My hubby got the Chirashi bowl and he loved it so much he ate the entire thing (big bowl).  We will totally return since it's in our neighborhood and they have a lot of different dishes to return for, including ramen!

I had a bad lumpia experience at this place. I went there since I had a huge craving for some authentic lumpia and I ordered the pork lumpia. It tasted freezer burned and the edges were burnt where the meat was busting out. My friend calls this kind of lumpia "lazy ass lumpia" cuz the edges are open faced and not enclosed....hahahahaa. Anyhow I might give this place a 2nd try if I'm ever in the neighborhood but highly doubt it.

Got the supreme pizza and wasn't impressed. It kind of tasted like a frozen pizza. We went in to order the pizza to go and their was no one at the counter for about 5 minutes...we almost left because of this. Then, while we waited for the pizza someone else came in to pick up their called in order and they waited 10 minutes at the counter until someone came out...bad service and mediocre pizza...won't return.

The atmosphere is really cool, but the food is mediocre. I ordered the veggie pizza and friend got the BBQ platter with garlic fries. The best thing was the garlic fries. The pizza wasn't good and the BBQ was average. Next time I think I'll try a burger with the garlic fries.

Small breakfast menu....probably a better place for lunch due to more choices. I got the San Diegan omelet (which the cashier said was their best seller). It was nothing spectacular and needed more veggies.  I also got the iced coffee and thought it didn't taste that great. However, the cupcakes I took home to eat later were pretty tasty. I might return for lunch one day for a sandwich .

2 words: not good. The mexican food here is as far from authentic as you can get, plus it is overpriced. I got the chicken tortilla soup to start off with and it was soooo bland and flavorless and loaded with tons of cheesy goop. Then I got a taco and tostada and both were of lower standards than taco bell (I would have preferred a taco bell taco). When I go to a Mexican restaurant in Arizona I expect a freshly fried taco shell, not your store bought Ortega brand taco shell and I expect shredded beef, but at Aunt Chilada's you get the store bought shells and ground beef! I won't return.

I believe this place is on the verge of shutting down. I went here the other night at 6:30 pm and the place was empty. I was shocked because during my last visit about 4 months earlier the place was packed at this prime dinner time. I also noticed that their giant chalkboard above the bar had zero beers listed or specials. Again, on our first visit this board was filled with special beers and other drink specials. We knew something was off. We decided on getting the Parmesan garlic fries appetizer since we remembered how good they were, but sadly they came out soggy and super greasy. I also ordered a pizza for my kids and an Asian chicken salad for myself. The pizza took forever but was decent, nothing special. My salad however, was TERRIBLE. So terrible in fact, that for the first time in my life I sent it back to the kitchen (to be tossed). The chicken was clearly cooked way earlier then when I ordered it and it was as dry as jerky. No joke, chicken jerky dry. My hubby actually thought it was grilled pita bread croutons. It looked old and dry. (SEE MY PICTURE I UPLOADED). I showed the waiter and he instantly knew why I was complaining and gladly removed it from our check. By this time, my kids were done eating so I wasn't able to re-order an entire new entree nor did I want to after my horrible salad experience. So basically I had to go home and make myself dinner. It is sad that this place has obviously went downhill. We won't EVER return. Quality went to shit.

Excellent and authentic Italian pizza from a wood fired oven. The crust is very thin and has to be eaten with a fork and knife like they do in Italy. It isn't crispy like American thin crust pizza. Only the crust is crispy and chewy. Don't expect American style pizzas where you can hold a slice and eat it. We loved our pizzas and it brought us back to our memories of eating pizza in Italy. They also make calamari right and tasty! Perfectly fried with a light batter (tentacles and rings)! We also ordered my all-time favorite pasta dish, clams with linguini in red sauce and it was to DIE FOR!! Next time I am trying the seafood pasta dish since I couldn't stop staring at our patrons eating it next to us. We got so excited when we heard our waiter speaking Italian to the cook. This is the real deal Italian food run by Italians!! We will definitely return very soon.

Great food and great quality. Super trendy restaurant with cool interior decor- super chic. I started off the meal with the calamari and it was soooo good. The breading was different from the typical- full of flavor and needed no dipping sauce. It was crunchy and spicy, how I like it. I also got some grilled mushrooms that were super yummy.Then I got various sushi rolls with the white miso soup, all very good.  I sat at the grilling bar and watched the cooks prepare all the meals. I saw them grilled these shrimp that were the size of lobsters ( a must try the next time I go) and I also seen them grill cod in banana leaves and my waiter said it was one of the most ordered items on the menu because it melts in your mouth....I was pissed she didn't mention this before I ordered! lol

I went for dinner and I'm a fan. We sat at the bar so we could grab items off the rotating belt. and it was so fun to see the different items swing by. It was hard to stop myself from grabbing everything.  I snagged a roll that had tuna tartare as a topping and it was delicious.  I also got seaweed salad and this was actually the only thing I didn't like at this place. It was really oily and lacking flavor (I've never had bad seaweed salad until I ate it here). I ordered some fried calamari and it was very good. They throw in the little squid tentacles, which are my favorite! We also ordered a few spicy tuna hand rolls, which were perfect with crisp nori and yummy tuna spilling out.  The main entree was a sashimi platter and the fish was super fresh and delicious (see picture and you will see what I'm talking about).  The service was exceptional. We will definitely return again!

After reading all the positive reviews I decided to try out the buffet on Sunday afternoon.  My husband and I loved everything! The quality was spectacular and everything was super fresh.  The buffet offers  deliciously seasoned basmati rice (my favorite in Phoenix), chicken curry, chicken masala, pakora, palak paneer, goat curry, salad, fruit, tandoori chicken, chai tea, and regular or garlic naan.  There were a few other items, but I don't remember what they were called.  We ordered the garlic naan and it was to die for. It was perfectly grilled and had just the right amount of garlic brushed on it.  For only $8.99 it was one hell of a bargain. The atmosphere is also very nice with beautiful paintings and decorative fixtures. They also play soothing music.  We knew the place was going to be good when half of the patrons were Inidan. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone on the east valley. We will definitely return on the weekends for the buffet!

Went to La Bocca  a few times and enjoyed each visit. Atmosphere is very cool and trendy. Really good artisan style pizzas with bubbly crispy crust and fresh toppings. Mediterranean platter is also very good (hummus, babaganoush with feta, pita triangles and rustic bread) as an appetizer or small dinner with your drinks (I got full of this huge platter). They also have really cool wine deals during their happy hour. Not a good place to go if you want to sit outside on the patio and conversate due  to the very loud and crazy sounding birds along Mill Ave. It's a freaking circus! But if you sit inside you'll be fine.

Yummy!  You will walk out of this place with a giant full belly, lol! We ordered the egg rolls and spicy chicken wings for starters. The egg rolls were really good and came with fresh and crispy romaine lettuce and dipping sauce. The spicy chicken wings were crispy and had a sweet and spicy taste- they were ok.  I then ordered the Bon Bo Hue to try something different and it was delicious! It came out with a nice plate of fresh bean sprouts, jalapeno slices, basil leaves, limes, and banana blossoms. The broth was so tasty and spicy. My hubby ordered some Pho and got a large and could not finish it because of the size--but he loved it. The atmosphere is really contemporary and clean--not what you usually see with Pho restaurants.

yuck! I'd actually rather eat Taco Bell then go to this place again. I got take-out from here the other day (beef taco and cheese enchilada combo) and it was not good AT ALL. The taco shell was store bought cardboard, not freshly fried and authentic and the beef was ground beef, not authentic shredded beef. It also had the tiniest sprinkling of shredded cheese and lettuce. The cheese in the enchilada was all rubbery and solid by the time I got home and ate it  (mind you I only live 5 min. away). The rice n beans were nothing to call home about. Definitely not authenic mexican food and definitely not worth your money. Will not return!

What is the hype people????I went here for lunch after seeing all the awesome  reviews, but I was disappointed. First, the menu is very hard to understand (see the pic that someone posted). I ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and hummus platter. There isn't much of a drink selection in the tiny fridge. For soda, all they had was the cans and they charged $1.00 for them. Later, while I was eating I noticed a lot of people were buying their drinks from the market, then coming over to order their food (pain in the ass if you ask me). Anyhow, so I was only 1 of a few people there and the food took quite a while. When they finally called my order I went up and asked for the "garlic sauce" that I heard so much about on here and the lady said it would cost $1.00. I said nevermind because I wasn't going to pay that for a small container of condiment! I was surprised at how small the sandwich was. It wasn't  impressive either. Just a grilled flatbread with a few pieces of  chicken, a few tomato slices, lettuce, and a little sauce. In my opinion this wasn't worth 3.99, but more worth 2.50 or something because of its size and how little filling there was.The hummus was good, but  nothing spectacular. This place is also in a dodgy part of town right across from project housing...literally right across the street. The market was pretty cool though and I'll prob return (during the daylight of course) for some olives, olive oil, and pita. BUT will skip out on dining here.

I've always loved El Pollo Loco. How can you not love yummy citrus marinated flame grilled chicken? sooooo gooood and getting hungry just thinking about it. Salsa bar is great and my favorite is the avocado salsa...I heavily douse that on everything. The pinto beans are a good side, along with the side salad (which is huge!), but have never cared for their rice, it is always a lil on the half done side and taste just like instant rice that they microwave or something. You get 3 tortillas with your combos and I like to make lil chicken tacos with them. For dessert you must get the churros...2 for 99 cents and they are always cooked to order and so yummy and fresh!

I went here to buy some pan de sal and empanadas and they were horrible! The pan de sol tasted like it was made dayyyyyyys ago, not fresh at all. The empanadas looked like like they were going to taste good, but the crust was so hard! I had to break it off to get to a decent part I could actually chew, but after a few bites I spit it out. Yes, it was that bad. I will never go back here again.

Very nice Asian market with a foodcourt. It's like a mini mall with different stores and restaurants and a food court.  I go here from time to time and love to eat lunch before I do my grocery shopping.  I just went the other day and there was a lot more vendors in the food court and the bakery finally opened up.  At the bakery I got a cream bun, which was yummy with airy and light bread and creamy custard filling.  I also got some cocunut bun thing and the filling was grainy and way too sweet. I also bought a bag of sho-pow with pork and veggie filling and it was pretty good, but later wished I got the honey bbq pork instead.

Love this place! They do Korean BBQ right and the best BONUS about this place is you get to pick 3 sides to go with your meal. You can pick from cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, glass noodles, broccoli, corn, bean sprouts, to name a few. Typical hawaiian bbq joints just give you rice and macaroni salad and I always crave the kimchi and pickles to go with it and this place gives you 3 options! I've had the kalbi, chicken bbq, and cold noodles. All very very good!

Great fast food order at the counter establishment. Very clean. I love their fish tacos and Mahi Mahi burritos. Rubio's never disappoints. They have fat free refried beans and they are so delicious. They also have a great salsa bar with fresh and yummy salsas. We love their $1.99 fish taco Tuesdays!

Delicious pizza! The pizza here is exactly how I like it, thin & crispy crust, with good quality ingredients! The salads are also very fresh and good and a small can feed 3-4 people easy! My hubby and I got a large pizza because it's only $2 more than the small and you get to take home leftovers :) The pizza is a bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for here! I just wish there was more of a selection on the menu. This place literally has 2 things (pizzas and salads).

Excellent Cajun food! We were very excited to try this place out since my hubby is from Louisiana and we love Cajun food. We ordered so much food since and it was all so delicious. We got some hushpuppies and a cup of seafood gumbo to start and thought they were both cooked perfectly. I wished I ordered a large bowl of that gumbo.....it was that good! Then we had the red beans and rice and a catfish dish and we were both very pleased. Their sweet tea is refreshing too! We will definitely return for  great meal.

Great place to board your bets! The staff is very friendly and genuinely care for your pets. I've boarded my 2 dogs there a few times and have been pleased. This facility is top notch and smells great! I was so surprised when I first visited that there was no trace of that dog boarding smell that I was accustomed to at other facilities. The floors and dog rooms were squeaky clean. I really love the play feature that you can pay for that gives your dog play time with other dogs and you can see them via webcam. I had such a blast seeing my dogs play and have a good time while I was on vacation. I definitely recommend this place!

Highly disappointed! This place charges high prices for low quality food. We ordered the fried calamari for an appetizer and right when it arrived I knew this place wasn't going to be good.  An Italian joint should have their calamari down to a perfection, this place not so much. Out came a small platter with about 7 rings of calamari that was completely flavorless and chewy.  The salads were alright, except for the few brown and wilted greens.  I ordered the linguine with clams, and it was mediocre. My friend ordered the orange roughy (fish) and it totally tasted like it was previously frozen. If your a fish eater you will instantly know that their fish isn't fresh when you bite into it.  It was very bland and had a watery texture to it like it was just thawed out and cooked. If your going to charge $25 for the fish entree you dayum well better be serving FRESH fish. I don't recommend this place to anyone and the only people that would actually like this place have really bad taste in food. The other people on here who wrote good reviews obviously have BAD taste in food.

I like the variety of food that this place has to offer, but I often order the pizza because it's really good. The service is always exceptional. On nice days it's really nice to sit in their outdoor patio area. Sushi is pretty good here too, along with their seaweed salad. I didn't like their calamari though.

Pretty good sushi in Queen Creek. We started out with the shrimp and veggie tempura $10.99 and it was very good (5 pieces of big shrimp and broccoli, bell peppers, onion, zucchini, yam). We also ordered miso soup $3.50, which was freaking huge! We thought it was going to be a small bowl like at most sushi places for like $1.50 but out came this giant bowl that could easily feed 3 people! We wish our waiter warned us. Then I ordered the sashimi platter $15 (disappointed that i had to order a bowl of rice $2.50 since it didn't come with it, non-traditional) and we ordered a rainbow roll $11.50. The sashimi slices were very fresh and thick cut and delicious. The rainbow roll was very good too! I probably wouldn't return just because I know of another sushi place where you get miso soup and rice with all your meals which equals a less expensive bill.

What  was I thinking when I ordered Pho at this place? sucked sooooo bad!!!! I was totally craving a rich broth and noodles on a cold day and out came this flavorless bowl of soup and noodles. Since I had two not so good experiences with this place I won't return.

Very similar to Filiberto's. Very small location with picture menu featuring all their combos...you know the usual suspects... 2 tacos w/rice n beans, or 1 enchilada with taco and rice n beans...get it? one downfall is that they don't have a salsa bar. If you want salsa you can grab some pre-packed lil containers of red salsa they have in this little fridge, but it's not the best. I prefer places with salsa bars where you can get jalepenos and carrots and a variety of salsas. Anyways, my hubby got the carne asada fries which were really good (how can you F#$% this up?) and I got a combo of cheese enchilada and bean tostada. The rice and beans beat Filibertos hands down, but the enchilada wasn't anything spectacular. This place is ok and I'll go back since it's right up the road from my casa.

Freaking disgusting! I moved into the area a few months ago and tried this place one late evening and got the asada nachos and it had zero flavor. The meat tasted like it was boiled with zero seasoning. Nasty. So then today, amonth later, I decide to give it one more try since I love the convenience of their drive-thru. Well same ending....gross! My son got the rolled tacos with guacamole and the guacamole tasted rancid and old. So after a few bites he threw his meal away. I got the two beef taco meal and again the beef had no flavor. I ate one taco just so I wasn't wasting all of my money and threw the rest away as well. I am praying that my son and I don't get food poisoning tonight. We will never return to eat here. Senor Tacos a few blocks away is soooooo much better.

I really love this gym. It is so nice and well maintained. There is always plenty of towels to grab before a workout.  The childcare is excellent and has the security part down. When you sign up as a member you and your child are given assigned wristbands to use during visits. The staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me. You can even tune into the cameras to watch your child on the tv's that are on the cardio equipment. Childcare is also open 7 days a week and doesnt close for lunch like most gyms. There is also plenty of group classes throughout the day if you are into Zumba or cycling,etc. I recommend this gym to anyone especially parents needing quality childcare.

We frequent Señor Tacos almost once a week. We absolutely love it. My two toddlers say it is their favorite place to eat. Anything you order here is going to taste good and the workers are always friendly.

Angela is awesome!! I just moved to the area and found the salon on Yelp and visited their Facebook page and saw amazing hair pics that showed off Angela's amazing work so I knew I had to make an appt. with her asap. I went in and showed her a pic of exactly what I wanted and she pulled it off to a T!!!

Don't be fooled by their 50% coupon. I went in for highlights and walked out paying $72 (after the 50% discount!). When I asked why it was so expensive after the discount was applied I was told it only discounted one service. I was confused since I only got one service (highlights), but was told  hey charge $20 for a blowdry and $10 for a toner. What kind of salon charges an extra $20 for a blow dry? Shouldn't that come standard with all services? My hair only goes a little past my shoulders and everytime I have ever got highlights the most I have paid was $75 at FULL price. I went in thinking I'd end up paying 40 for highlights with my coupon. This place charges way too much for their services. No wonder I was one of 2 women there on a Saturday, when most salons are usually jam packed.

Great pizza with a superb hand-tossed dough crust! We got fried zuchinni as an appetizer and we all loved it! Even my picky toddlers. Then we got a medium pizza and that sucker was HUGE!! Great sauce and dough. The crust was thin, New York style. Our waitress was awesome too and always made sure our drinks were filled and that we we had everything we needed. We will definition return since we had a great experience.

Food was alright. I got the clams with linguine in white sauce. I prefer whole clams with their shells in this pasta dish but the one here came with the canned clams. It was a little too greasy for my taste and it had too much parmesan cheese on top of it. The salad and bread was pretty good. Probably won't return.

Wow this place was awesome! I felt like I was whisked away to an Indian palace. This place was decorated nicely with Indian vases and paintings with lots of chandeliers.  They also play Indian music. NOW for the best part.....the food was delicious! I went on a Sunday for the buffet during lunch and I had a $6.95 coupon from the newspaper (which is in the paper every single week). Quite a bargain when we saw all the different choices. They also have all you can drink mango lassi at the buffet! When you arrive they bring you a plate of freshly grilled garlic naan and they ask if you'd like more when you polish it off...but we didn't need more after the first serving which was more than plenty.  All of the food was so fresh and hot and full of wonderful flavors. My favorite was the tika chiken masala, basmati rice, and spinach paneer. The goat curry was also fabulous and the meat was super tender. The waitresses and other staff members were very friendly and attentive. I am definitely a fan and plan to return for the buffet again very very soon!!!!!

Even better now....now with every buffet order they bring you a fresh sizzling platter of tandoori chicken to your table. Can this place get any better? My favorite place ever! The staff is super attentive and you are never out of something to drink.

Excellent Chinese food!! This place is way better than Panda Express in terms of quality and portion sizes. I haven't dined at their establishment, but have ordered take-out several times and it is always ready to pick up in 10 minutes! Everything we've ordered from here has been good. We always order the dinner combos ($7-9) and two of them feeds our family of four and we still have leftovers!!  They come with soup, an eggroll, a few fried wontons and your entree plus fried rice and chow mein. The portions are huge! All the stir-frys have that yummy hot wok flavor where the meat and veggies are seared perfectly. I am happy we found this place right in our neighborhood.

Just ok and HIGHLY overpriced for mediocre soft serve out of a food truck. Nothing special or different except my depleted bank account after buying a few kids a cone with sprinkles. Rip off.

I am glad we have this Pho establishment in the West Valley. The Pho has always been pretty good and plentiful and the staff is always friendly and attentive. The eggrolls are always on point! I have to try out a Banh Mi sandwich sometime. Everytime I come here I always see Vietnamese people eating here as well so that must be a good sign right?

Meh.....I've had way better. I ordered the Pho Tai and eggrolls. The bowl of Pho was very small compared to other restaurants with a very small amount of rice noodles and meat! $7.25 for what should have been called a kids bowl. I never been to a Pho restaurant that was stingy with their rice noodles (which has to be one of the cheapest ingredients). I ate all my noodles within minutes and was still very hungry. The broth wasn't that great either. You can immediately tell just by looking if the broth is a good one and this one was a murky color with no richness to it. The spring rolls were really good, but they came with a few iceberg lettuce pieces, which were too small to use for wrapping  around my rolls. I won't return that's for sure.

I don't ever go here because the drive-thru line is always crazy long and takes FOREVER!!! Not worth the wait in my opinion. I also think the coffee drinks are wayyy to sweet. i can do without half the sugar and it'd be perfect.

Great donuts! Always fresh and tasty. I just wish they made more donuts because they run out of a great selection very fast. After 10 am there is a small variety to choose from.

Disappointed. Bland. Ordered the chicken schawarma and hubby got the lamb shank. I thought the chicken was very plain tasting and a bit dry. It also came with a slice of pita bread which was hard like toast (stale maybe?). I didn't even eat half of the meal and tossed it. Hubby's lamb shank had a weird fishy taste, yes I said fishy taste on a hunk of lamb  Needless to say, we won't be returning.

Great authentic Guamanian food! I lived on Guam for three years and I instantly fell in love with the red rice and empanadas so I was thrilled to find out about this gem. The red rice is perfect just like I remember. They also make the empanadas fresh when you order them so it is a bit of a wait but totally worth it! So crunchy and full of flavor. The workers here are super friendly and always have a smile on their faces. I got a bbq platter plate and everything in it was spectacular. I highly recommend this place. You have to try the red rice and empanadas!

Really cool donut shop with unique flavors. I highly recommend the Samoa donut. Heavenly!!! The workers were very friendly and extremely patient while my kiddos slowly picked out a dozen donuts. I recommend getting their super early because selections dwindle after 10am!

Delicious!!!! 3 words: Hokaido milk tea!!!!! Oh and add the pudding. Out of this world. So milky and the pudding (which resembles flan) adds bits of creaminess. So yummy. Can't wait to try the other flavors out.

This place was delicious! The seafood tasted so fresh and that is because they fly it in daily and it is never frozen. We started out with a dozen oysters and they were perfection and tasted like they were just plucked from the salty ocean. I also ordered a pound of shrimp (whole meaty large pieces with the head intact) and chose the trifecta sauce at a level 2 (jalapeño spicy level) and it was spicy and full of flavor. My hubby got the shrimp and crab legs at chose level 6 because he is insane and loves super super spicy foods. Level 6 is the Caroline Reaper pepper (hottest pepper out there) and a level 3 is habaneros. So if you like spicy foods you will love the heat levels here. Besides their seafood by the pound selections you can also get fried seafood baskets like catfish and fries and their were also po'boys. The waiters were super friendly and helpful with the menu choices. We are seafood lovers so we will definitely return soon!

I heard about this place through a mommy friend of mine and thought it sounded so fabulous and so my mommy' group decided to have a play date here to check it out. There is a tiny pastry case with a few pricey options like $4 scones or $6 tiny pieces of quiche, but nothing really simple and kid friendly. I really liked the enclosed backyard play area for our children, however we got really turned off when one of our friends arrived late and came to greet our group in the backyard and she had only been there 10 minutes before an English male staff member approached her in front of us all and told her she needed to make a purchase of some sort if she wanted to be there with her kids. So embarrassing!!! She just wanted to say hi to us before she waited in the long line to buy some coffee. That left a bad taste in our mouths and I heard they have since added a $2 per child play tax to enter their property now!!! They even charge babies! So ridiculous. Even museums, amusement parks, and zoos don't charge babies (or kids under 2 for that matter) to enter their premises. This place had great potential, but parents aren't going to pay an arm and a leg for a cup of coffee. My friend went there after their new play fee was implemented with her 1 and 3 year old and after ordering a latte, scone, juice and paying the play fee for both her kids her total was $18. Ummmm no thank you.
