This is another place that is commonly suggested by friends that we end up going to, only to be disappointed afterwards.  Its a loud, boisterous sprawling place with a bar and plenty of large tables. Service is pretty good, and they handle large parties well.  The food...is uninspired and bland. The bread is commercial (not made in-house) but pretty tasty.  The red sauce is...pretty bad. Its watery and seems to have no spice to it, certainly no detectable garlic or oregano. The pasta was overcooked and the minestrone (supposed to be a specialty) was uninspired.  The veal parmigiana was HORRID. Pounded so flat that frying made it tasteless like a piece of breaded cardboard, covered in cheese and that tasteless sauce. The spaghetti side was forgettable. My wife's fettuccine alfredo was watery the first time and too thick the second, and both times gritty.  Next time we're dragged here I'm going to try the pizza, which actually looks good...they'll need to impress me quite a bit for me to ever actually suggest this place on my own.

Absolutely typical mid-range Chinese fair. The Pu Pu platter that other reviews raved about was middle of the road, with the eggrolls at the low end and beef skewers a bit better than average.  The House Special Sesame Chicken was good, but nothing special, and a bit too sweet for my taste. The Moo Shu Pork was not bad at all, but was absolutely typical of the dish.  In general, it was slightly above average for typical Chinese food fair. Nothing special to remember the place, and there are a dozen others like it in town.  At 6pm on a Saturday night, we were the only table when seated, with two other tables being seated afterwards, but there were at least 5 phone calls for takeout while we were there, there was certainly nothing about the decor to recommend eating in versus takeout.

People keep suggesting this as a great Italian place, and we keep going, only to talk about our disappointment later.  The decor is typical small-Italian place: fairly kitschy scenery, with the  wait-staff in ties and cummerbunds, which is a bit odd as it isn't a fancy place by any means.  We've been there 3 times now, and every time there is an older lady with a cane (she seems to be the manager or owner) hovering around. Never has she approached us, and seems to just concentrate on harrassing the staff. Our waitress this last time rudely interrupted our conversation every single time she came to the table.   The salads are ok, nothing special here. The bread is quite good (and plentiful - small whole loaves instead of pieces).  The food is mediocre: I've tried the pasta (spaghetti & meatballs), Italian favorites (lasagna), and the "specials" (it was so unspecial I don't even remember what it was). My wife had the gnocchi this time, which was a bit tough. They wanted to charge $3 to do half pesto and half alfredo sauce for her gnocchi, regardless of the fact that the pesto sauce was $2 MORE than the alfredo on the menu!  In fact, thats pretty much the best description: the food is bland and overpriced. Their red sauce seems unseasoned and the meat sauce had little meat in it. I just see no reason to ever go back, unless it's a friends choice, and then I'd do my best to talk them into a great Italian, like Il Posto.

The place in the Valley for upscale Mexican food!   The carnitas are exceptional and my wife regularly demands the chilaquiles.  Save room for dessert, as the flan and chocolate cream pie (made with Mexican drinking chocolate and cinnamon) are fantastic, both served with homemade whipped cream.  If your looking for upscale French-inspired Mexican, this place can't be beat!

Like many other reviewers, we tried Padre's because of a Groupon.   Wait staff was competent, and our drinks stayed mostly full.  We had the calamari as an appetizer: very overpriced at $10.95, I liked the flavor (its got a little chili mixed in with the breading). I like one of the three dipping sauces, and my wife liked a different one. When the waitress asked if we liked it, my wife indicated it was greasy and chewy. She apologized, but not really convincingly.  For entrees, I had the garlic shrimp tacos and my wife had the "Tia's Enchiladas" with spinach and cheese. My tacos were 3 small tacos with a decent amount of shrimp, cilantro, lettuce, and a pineapple salsa. They weren't bad, but were not very garlicy. My wife's enchiladas were good, nothing special. The ever-present sides of refried beans were typical of the variety, and the rice was well done with good flavor. Contrary to some other reviews, I would have called the plate sizes ordinary and not "huge".  For desert, my wife and I were going to split the banana epanadas with brandy caramel, but asked for it to be served without the brandy, as my wife has a severe alcohol allergy. The server checked with the manager and said they could do it, but that the caramel would lose a lot of its flavor without the brandy, and said it all burned off in the cooking. Well, from experience, my wife and I know it isn't true (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Food_and_cooking), so we asked for it anyway.  Then the server went to place the order and the cooks said the brandy was pre-mixed with the caramel. We cancelled the desert order. It was a bit frustrating that the manager didn't know how the dishes were prepped in the kitchen.   Overall, it was typical mexican food with a "modern" take (apparently if you put pineapple salsa on shrimp tacos and a fancy swirl of sauce on the enchiladas its "modern") -- personally, there are much better Mexican restaurants in town.

What can I say? Feeny's has quickly become one of our favorite places for dinner.  The hostess, Maria, is a star in every way: wonderful, happy, and its impossible to be a returning guest without a hug! Its just a bonus that she says "asparagus" with a Greek accent I find sexy, and my entire table laughs at me every time she says it! The busboy Nestor is usually our personal drink refiller, and a great guy all around.  The salad bar is exactly the same as every 1970s salad bar at the steakhouse your parents dragged you to, complete with GOOD jello!  Steaks are done really well, and its clear the chef cares about his customers. Maria will not hesitate to fix any that isn't perfect in her opinion, too!  The Beef Wellington is a nice treat, as is the Tornado Oscar and other specialties. Definitely try the Osso Bucco and the Greek lamb chops!  Decor isn't a strong point at all - its casual place and nobody cares how your dressed. The food is great and the staff is too!

My wife and I went here for our 15th Wedding Anniversary dinner. We chose the place specifically because of Mark Tarbell's reputation as a chef.  Everybody makes mistakes. It is how you handle them that shows what kind of a person you are. In the restaurant business, it's that attitude that turns a "we won't be back" into "we'll definitely be back!"  The story:  We arrived for our reservation and were promptly seated. We started with the Kale Chips as a starter, and both quite liked them.  I ordered the scallops and my wife had the halibut special. My wife's was excellent, she was very happy. My scallops were fairly underdone -- cutting into each of them it was clearly raw in the middle. The garnish of pea tendrils and morels was fantastic.  I informed a passing employee (I thought she was a hostess) as our waiter was busy with a large table,  and she agreed with a quite surprised look that they were definitely undercooked.  When I got the plate back, it had been reheated and not refired...I was a little surprised to have them reheated (at $38 a plate) instead of a refire, but they were well cooked now and quite good.  I informed the waiter after I'd finished that the round small potatoes had also been a bit underdone but edible, probably because the garnish was rushed by the undercooked scallops. To be honest, the waiter kind of ignored us a bit after this.  The employee that I'd returned my dinner to came back and apologized again. It turns out she was a manager, and she informed us that she was comping my dinner, as well as two deserts of our choice.  The deserts, by the way, were outstanding! My wife had the creampuffs and I had vanillabean cheesecake with a very unique and tasty rosemary caramel sauce.  After dinner, the owner and Chef, Mark Tarbell came by. He said that mistakes didn't happen often, but that he wanted to make sure it was properly resolved, and he apologized and specifically thanked me for bringing a mistake to his attention.  I said that it had, and I was happy, and my wife specifically told Chef Tarbell how pleased she was with manager's response and attitude.  We'll definitely be back to Tarbell's both because of the food (which was excellent, and that they fixed the error quickly) and the customer service!

Ok, I admit it: we're regulars...almost once a week regulars.  The bread and pesto is something both my wife and I always look forward to, as well as the friendly and very attentive staff.  My wife almost always has the baked tortellini: a great mix of tortellini and bubbling cheese thats always filling and satisfying. The linguini with clam sauce really should be clam with linguini -- the clams are so plentiful that you can barely see the linguini and quite garlicy to boot. The lasagna is huge and quite good, as are the regular specials of Zuppe de Pesche (a huge platter of seafood over linguini) and the Veal Sorentino, a wonderfully tasty dish of waffer-thin veal and eggplant with cheese and a delightful mushroom sauce. Recently they've had Manhattan clam chowder as a soup special, and its really fantastic -- I'm not a fan of the red chowder normally, but theirs is really top notch: plenty of clams, nice spicy broth. Its a must-order if its a special, as is the Veal.  The standout desert is the hazelnut tortufo, with the cheesecake and creme bulee being good and nicely dressed.  The decor is a bit odd -- they've recently redecorated with weird "fairy" wood and glass sculpture things that really need to be tossed out, and a few odd "rustic farm implements" that clash with the modern crisp decor.  But the food is top notch, and the decor is just a point of dinner conversation.

The difference between 4 and 5 stars, in my opinion, is the little things that make a restaurant just over the top. Tuck Shop has that, in spades.   We've been meaning to try the place since we saw it on some TV show last summer, and finally on a random Saturday night took the plunge.  At 6:15 the place was already packed, with a 45 minute wait for a table for two. Luckily, the host (John, I believe the owner?) suggested sitting at the  bar, which was open. The bar has nifty hooks for a lady's purse right under the counter (so the purse doesn't touch the floor) which made my wife smile.  Laura, the bartender, immediately made sure we felt very much at home with a friendly and very attentive attitude as we ordered, easily answering the questions of all the bar patrons.  My wife's smile got a lot larger as we ordered non-alcoholic drinks: I had iced tea (the Republic of Tea's darjeeling in a bottle, but only $3) and she had Ginger Ale: house-made from real ginger, with tonic water and lime. It was FANTASTIC, wow!  Based on the TV show, we first had the beer-battered cheese curds, which were quite tasty - peppery with a great light cheese flavor, and just enough for a taste for both of us for $4.  We then ordered two items off the "smaller plates" portion of the menu  -- think of them as appetizers. They are a bit pricy ($9 each) but two of them would make a nice little meal.   First was the stuffed mejool dates with chorizo. I would never have thought of the combination, but they were truly delicious! Served on a bed of arugula that had a great lemon tang, the arugulu really added to the flavor of the dates instead of just being a throw-away bed of greens.  Next was another TV Show mention, the Times Mac & Cheese. Very very good! A bit of spice and good high-end cheese choices made my wife's smile grow into tasty little yummy noises.  By now, we knew we'd be back.  We then decided to split a main course (the menu calls them "for sharing" but I'd call it a single person entree, in the $20 range): the pork chop with kugel (noodles) and salsa verde. The chop was perfectly cooked, and the salsa verde was clearly homemade and very very good. I'd have liked a bit more of the salsa and less of the sour cream, but thats really personal taste. The kugel was an interesting side and was good.  Finally, we decided to split the peach cobbler for desert. As you'll probably expect by now, it was excellent, with a nice cinnamon flavor with tasty homemade whipped cream and biscuit.  All in all, a fabulous meal for a decent price: Laura the bartender helped make this a great meal we've already talked to friends about going back!

Ok, we eat here almost every week!  The food is great (I've had exactly one item I wouldn't order again)...the burgers are top notch, the pizzas very good, the salads exceptional...I could go on and on...  The staff is awesome, really friendly and attentive. The owner is a sweetheart.  It's just a great local place...and definitely try the calamari, it's outstanding!

We'd been meaning to stop in here for a while, and now I wish we'd done so sooner! Great burgers (adding round short rib to the mix gives a great flavor!) and you can easily split an order of frys. My wife liked the homemade horchata as well -- we'll be back!
