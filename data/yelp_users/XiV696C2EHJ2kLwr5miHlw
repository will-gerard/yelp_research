Great service, delectable food, awesome atmosphere... What more can a girl say?  Venture to the basement -via a gorgeous stone-framed stairwell or the semi-sketchy elevator- for a cozy cabin feel and be sure to check out their specials (on the chalkboard)!  I dined there with a group of four on a Friday night and my entree came out later than the others, so our Server ended up comping our dessert, which was both unexpected and extremely accommodating.   Get creative, because the Rokerij boasts a full bar, but no Cocktail List; or simply go for a glass of vino.  For a filling and mouth-watering entree, try the Rokerij Steak, Chimoy Chicken, or Red Chile Pasta.  Got a sweet tooth?  The Creme Brûlée is guaranteed to put a smile on your face.  I pinky swear that this place is unlike any other Valley eatery...  Foodies, ASU students, and even Snobsdale peeps unite!  This is the place for you!

LGO is definitely a staple in Phoenix, especially if you enjoy the Arcadia side of town.  Friday night was my 2nd visit to Le Grande, and I have decided that it is where self-proclaimed BOHEMIANS and HIPSTERS alike can come to UNITE!  We (my boyfriend + his brother's girlfriend + myself) waited about 30 minutes for our table, which is on-par for no reservations on a Friday at 8pm anywhere... no big deal.  While you wait, check out the GROCERY STORE!  (Think Urban Outfitters' quirky gifts meets baked goods at Bertha's Cafe... and let's not forget the fine selection of Vino from around the world) :)  :)  Needless to say, that kept three of us occupied until our table was ready.  The Gladiator Pizza is great for all you men too afraid to put anything green in your mouths -meat galore- .  The Avocado Pizza is what I ordered during my first visit, and it was just as simple, tasty, and amazing as I remember... Ladies and gentleman: the perfect amount of cheese, avocados, proscuitto, fresh basil, and lemon zest. Mmmm..  Two pizzas were more than enough for the 3 of us and we did a bottle of Malbec to complement it all.  Our server was very helpful with a great wine recommendation, and we even ordered Red Velvet Cake to top it off.  Maybe we just weren't expecting such a rich taste, but the Red Velvet was not something to go back for, or ever order again, in that case.  However, the gelato (suggested on the menu to complement the cake) was phenomenal.. it was Almond flavored with a tart raspberry? swirled in and a hint of lemon zest.  By the way, they make their own gelato in-house and you can even stop into the shop and grab some if you're not looking for dinner or groceries.   All in all, LGO has a great Portland/San Fran vibe to it and food/wine/dessert/merchandise to boot!  So stop reading and GO!!!

Soooo I was checking out my Yelp profile and decided to up my ante with another review... this time, not so great.    I was starving (what else is new?) on a Friday night so I dragged my boyfriend out for some Mexican fare.  Let's start at the door: the hostess didn't look too excited to greet or seat us.  Our server took our drink order, we received our trusty chips and salsa, and got to work.    The menu was pretty standard for an "upscale" Mexican restaurant, seafood selection and all.  After the server described "The Monterrey" plate as one you could fit a turkey on, I was convinced.  This hefty entree consists of four different types of enchiladas, a chile cheese relleno, chicken taco, and guac... how could we possibly go wrong?  The plate arrived ginormous, as promised; I just wasn't particularly impressed by any of it.  As much as I love food, I am a quality over quantity kind of girl, and this entree was not cuttin' it.  I honestly can't point out anything in particular that I did not like about the plate, it just wasn't memorable, finger lickin' good, or (please insert cliche here).    When dessert was offered, we politely declined.  Our waiter dropped the check fleetingly and muttered a "Thank You" or something of that sort as he zipped past our table.  I do give the place props on decor, as the paintings, statues, and lighting throughout the restaurant are impressive and reminiscent of the culture of Mexico.

Would it be an overstatement to say this is the best food I have had in the Valley?... No.  Caffe Boa is nestled in a historic building off Mill and 4th Ave. Don't be thrown off by the college town location though; this place is definitely a hidden gem.  The food selection here includes Mediterranean, Slavic, and Italian influences, emphasizing the Adriatic region.  With a menu that boasts local produce, dairy, bread, meat, and even olive oil from nearby Queen Creek, high-quality ingredients are abound.  Oh, and did I forget to mention that their wine list is unparalleled, with over 500 selections from around the world?  Boa has dubbed this season the "Summer of Acid", amending their wine menu to selections with higher acidity.  These wines tend to cut through food and complement hot Phoenix days oh-so-perfectly.  WHITE SELECTION: Try the Colle Stefano Verdicchio for a light, crisp taste with notes of apple and a little kick at the end.   RED SELECTION: Go with the N2 Pinot Noir from Napa Valley if you're not afraid to try wine on-tap.  (No seriously, these wines come out of steel barrels, leading the way in wine innovation and reducing environmental impact!!)  I haven't even dusted off the cuisine... Charcuterie is a must.  Choose 5 and go with the:   *Pate (Meat spread made from rabbit and pork meat) *Pancetta (similar to bacon) *Burrata (rich, soft cow mozzarella with a creamy center) *Taleggio (semi-soft, washed rind cheese from northern Italy with a   mild flavor and fruity finish) *Bresaola  (air-dried, salted beef fillet which is aged 3 months then thinly sliced... comparable to Prosciutto)   FIRSTS: classics include the Shrimp Adriatico and Bruschetta.  For a  simmering Tempe night though, I say go with the Street Corn or Prosciutto and Peaches.  MAINS: the Halibut and Butler Steak are staples for the "meat and potato" type, but don't overlook the Vongole e Patate for unforgettable clams with a sweet and spicy zing.  PASTA: the Braised Kid Stracci outdoes itself with quality ingredients like Fossil Creek Goat Cheese and Maya's Purslane (local, small-leafed green with a somewhat bitter taste and tons of Omega-3).  Summer Squash Ravioli is great for just that: Summer; and Voodoo Penne is a classic dish with a mild Cajun Cream sauce.  What else can I say?  The menu is seasonal, so don't bet on my picks, but definitely test out the occasional frog leg.  Make sure you leave room for Dessert (varies as well) for a great homemade tiramisu, sorbet, or pannacotta.  Whether it's a first date, 6 month anniversary, grad celebration, or family dinner, Caffe Boa will never fail you!!

Decided to stop in here on a whim.  It was a Friday around 5pm and we were hoping for happy hour (dock a star for regular price menu).  That being said, we sat at the sushi bar and had the pleasure of being served by Richard, the owner.  Super nice guy who chatted us up and sent a few surprises our way.  Have you ever tried fresh wasabi? Mmmmm.  I can't remember exactly which rolls we ordered but... the fish tastes like it recently came out of an ocean (quite a feat for Phoenix), and I have officially been turned an eel fan.  Richard cares about his little business, and it shows.  Happy Hour(s) are being modified soon, so that fifth star may just find its way... with the help of some sake bombs, of course.

Suki suki nowwww... Time for some Pho!  Can you say delicious in Vietnamese?  WHO CARES?!  This place has got the best soup in town and unlike its neighbor, LoLo's Chicken and Waffles, this is healthy stuff!    I have ordered the Chicken, Broccoli, and Bok Choy Pho twice now and have no complaints.  They bring out all the fixins too... Bean sprouts, basil leaves, cilantro and lime mmm.  Rice noodles, chicken, broccoli, and Bok Choy are simmered in a mouthwatering broth sprinkled with herbs to boot!  If you haven't gone yet, you better put that fried chicken down and check yourself!

I don't like businesses that scam people.  And I especially don't like businesses that scam my mother... literally.  My mom went in for the advertised "$29 cleaning & x-ray".  What she came out with was an x-ray and a bill quoting $3449 for deep cleaning, flouride varnish, oral irrigation, and lots of other nonsense.  Here's an idea: why not advertise correctly and give your customers what they think they are getting?  Quoting someone a price for a cleaning, sending them out without a cleaning and instead with an insanely high bill is so unethical.  Stop preying on people without health insurance.  Start doing what you say you will do.

Can you say adorable?  No I don't just mean the cupcakes!  All the girls who work here are such sweethearts!  Don't get me wrong, their red velvet, vanilla, and chocolate are to-die-for, but it's the service that really puts the cherry on top.  Their cupcakes are rich and just perfect.  If you feel like a "sweet genius" (food network show with a very creepy host), buy the batter yourself and go crazy!   Definitely a staple in the Scottsdale area now, Sprinkles is a must.  Stop in, get your dose of sugar, love, and happiness and go about your day!  KEEP CALM AND EAT CUPCAKES.

Let me point out first and foremost, I am impressed by the CONSISTENCY at Yard House each time I dine there.  No matter the location, I can always count on delicious food and great service.  With such a large menu, it really is a wonder that they can get it right every time... and I was feeling particularly hungry after an arctic Coyotes-Hawks game.    Truffle Fries= heaven in my mouth.  Topped with parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, this "Snack" item was definitely worth the calories.  Regular fries will never live up to their full potential again.  On the appetizer menu, the Coconut Shrimp is a winner.  Four very generously sized butterfly shrimp are battered and fried to perfection atop a bed of shaved carrots, papayas, and cilantro.. give me a second while I wipe the drool off my keyboard please.  Mac and Cheese Squared is a personal AND House Favorite for good reason: cheesy noodles cooked in truffle oil with wild mushrooms, applewood bacon, and chicken breast.  Definitely a staple menu item.  The burgers are great, happy hour menu is awesome in forward and reverse, and did I mention that the selection of draught beer wraps around the bar? Thanks for being consistently awesome Yard House!

Soo just a heads up, this place is closed to the public... but that's not why I give it 1 star.  I had a Groupon that expired a while ago (October 2011).  HOWEVER, Groupon Terms & Conditions states that all Groupons, past their promotional period, are good for the amount purchased.  In my case, I had purchased two $15 Groupons for a total of $30.    I walk into this place at about 2:30pm on a Tuesday and see a sign out front: "Closed to the Public.  Wholesale Only".  There were still a couple employees inside, so I walked in figuring they would let me redeem my voucher and move on with my life.... not the case.  The girl behind the counter immediately tells me that they are closed.  I explained that I had an expired Groupon that I needed to redeem.  She responded that the Groupon expired in 2010 and they would no longer honor it.  After checking my Groupon app, I commented back that it actually expired in 10/2011 and I just wanted to grab my $30 worth of merchandise, which they had to honor.  She again said no, stating that the store was closed.  I asked if she could make an exception since the store was still standing, with employees and clothing in it.  "I told you I wouldn't make an exception" was her response.  That was it.  RUDE customer service.  I would never go back to this place if it were still open, which is sad because they had some cute items!  Best of luck with future endeavors (you're going to need it), read the terms & conditions before you put out a Groupon!!!!  Please excuse me while I call Groupon for my refund.... tata b&*^hes!!!

Ok so here's the 411.   It was my cousin's birthday so me, her and another cousin decided on F n B as our dining destination.  We got there around 9:25pm on this lovely Wednesday night, so you'd think they would be trying to shoo us out, seeing as they close at 10... But our dining experience turned out just the opposite.  I ordered pasta with lamb (delicious), and we also enjoyed Jidori chicken, a specially made vegetarian pasta dish, and to-die-for falafel.  Our server, Brian, was so attentive throughout our meal, offering wine tastings and checking up on us to make sure we were doing okay.  Yes, F n B is a tiny restaurant perched among many "trendier" spots in Old Town, but this was some of the best food (and LOCAL wine) that I have ever experienced.  Choose this spot for an authentic meal, some great vino, or just stop in to see Brian!  FnBest,   Natasha

I AM GOING TO EXCLAIM THIS IN CAPITAL LETTERS BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A TRUTH THAT ALL OF HUMANKIND SHOULD BE AWARE OF!! Fox Restaurant Concepts are PERFECT. Now, you should know, I don't say this about many places... Or people, or things.. But when it comes to Fox, one cannot go wrong.   True Food is just one of the many Fox Valley restaurants I completely adore. Craving Italian? Head to North Fattoria Italiana in Arcadia. Need your pizza fix at work? Sauce is definitely the place to be. Truffle fries and fine dining with a modern twist? Olive and Ivy. Super cool comfort food that will fill you up and make you want to frequent Downtown Phoenix.. every night? Arrogant Butcher. Gosh darn it, even the names of these hotspots are uber cool!  Sam Fox is simply a genius. His concepts are flawless, food is impeccable and staff? CONSISTENTLY the best service I ever receive at any establishment. Shout out to Brock and the accommodating/super-friendly staff who took care of me tonight at True Food @ the Quarter! I will be back... A lot.  What can I say Fox? You have stolen my heart.... And all the doggy-bag space in my refrigerator.  Thank you for the excellence. I refer you to everyone I know, and the keen attention-to-detail NEVER goes unappreciated...  FOX ON!

The only reason TK's doesn't get 4 stars is because the pricing could have been better for lunch.  Other than that though, I ordered the burger, my boyfriend got the salmon, and both were amazing!    Service was prompt and the atmosphere was just what you would expect it to be at Scottsdale Quarter: a few tables on business lunch, a couple families, and golfers ready to grub.  All of this amidst a small bar, brick detailing, and a fancily upholstered booth parallel to the kitchen, where chefs can be seen whisking, flipping, and plating away.  The burger was one of the best in the valley, with a choice of fries or arugula salad (I chose the healthy option this time).  The salmon was pan-seared to perfection, atop a bed of fingerling potatoes and green beans.  With many dining options at the Quarter, this is one that I am sure to taste again... and maybe even try that pulled pork that everyone is raving about.

Took me a while to write this review, but the time has finally come... DUN DUN DUNNN.  By far, WORST customer service I have ever received at a restaurant.  I walked in on a Friday night at about 7:30pm after getting my hair done at one of Quarter salons.  All I wanted was to grab a quick bite, since I had to rush to work soon after.    I approached the counter and waited for one of the many employees behind it to take my order.  I stood there patiently for a few minutes, watching as the servers behind it glanced over and saw me waiting, while they mindlessly polished glasses and did God knows what else.  A few minutes later, my patience was wearing thin and the old "Good things come to those who wait" idiom was not sounding so nice.  A young man finally walks up and boldly asks, "Have you been helped yet?"  I responded that I hadn't and he began to take my order.  I told him what I would like and he said that he couldn't put the order in right away, because the girl with access to the system was nowhere to be found.  I was confused.  He suggested, "I can go ahead and place the order with the kitchen, and we don't know where she is, but she will probably be back in time to take your payment before your burger is ready."  I thought this was extremely unprofessional and outrageous, but I was hungry, so I agreed.  Then this boy inquires "It's to go, right?"    I responded that I would be eating in.  He pointed me over to the hostess and said that she would seat me if that was the case.  I told him that I just wanted to enjoy a burger at the counter, and that I was in a hurry.  He responded that it was full service.  So a quick rundown.... employees staring at me instead of taking my order, my order unable to be entered into the system because the girl with access was "nowhere to be found", assuming that this was a carry out order because I was a solo diner, directing me to the hostess to be seated when he could have seated me himself, and refusing to let me eat my burger at the counter because it was "full service" and he probably assumed I wouldn't tip.  I can see why this place is closed.  This is horrendous service... take a hint from FOX Concepts and get your act together, Grimaldi's!!!

This place has GREAT food... one of the only spots in the Valley where you can find lamb kabob, and their rice is superb!  All of their dressings and sauces are made fresh and taste amazing.  They have daily specials like lamb shank, ghormeh sabzi (a persian stew) and pomegranate chicken.  This is the real deal folks!  Grab some tabbouli, get your gyro fix, or go all out with the lamb shanks.  Either way, I promise you can't go wrong.

We're planning our wedding on the fabulous rooftop at this modern wonder of a hotel.  Did you know the W modeled themselves after the Palomar? Yup, I said it.    The staff is, as everyone else mentioned, amazing.  Beside being super-friendly, they are extremely attentive and actually show genuine interest in their guests.  The concierge chatted up my fiancé and I, wanting to get  all the 411 on his proposal.. How cute is that?  We have looked at a plethora of venues, and I'm pretty sure nobody cared before.  Beside the five-star service, this place is gorgeous.  Attention has been paid to every last detail.  After waltzing into the impressive lobby, I promise that you will forget what city you're in.  Funny thing is, we looked at Kimpton hotels in Chicago and San Diego as well, but they really outdid themselves with this one.  Stay tuned for wedding updates!!!
