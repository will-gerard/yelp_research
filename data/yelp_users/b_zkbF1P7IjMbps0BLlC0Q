We have been frequenting this Native New Yorker for years and we have never been so disrespected as we were today. We sat down with our family which included a 10 year old on the bar area at 3:15 on a Sunday. The server came up to us and let us know that kids had to sit in the dining room.  We let her know that there was another kid in the bar. She told us it was the bartenders son. It was not the bartenders shift. He was there sitting as a patron with friends.  We are not the type to complain or leave a restaurant, but we are done with Native New Yorker for now. We understand rules, but they should apply to everyone. Even the bartenders and all employees. You can contact me at emily.liscom@gmail.com if you need any more info about this situation.

We have been taking our dog here since we got him, and we really like this store.  We went to Kathy for Intermediate and Advanced classes, and she was so wonderful, and our dog Oliver adored her.  Everybody in the store is very friendly.  We recently took Oliver here for a grooming, and we just loved everybody in the grooming salon as well.  All groomers the were so friendly, and accommodating.  Oliver also came out looking like a million bucks, so big thanks to everyone that helped groom him.  The only thing I regret is not taking Oliver here in the first place.  The drive is 100% worth it for us.

We came in last week because we wanted to see what the hype was all about.  This was hands down the BEST sushi restaurant we have ever been to.  We sat at the bar, and Saki, the owner made us rolls he thought we would like.  They were all excellent! We will be frequenting this restaurant a lot!!! I would recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone who wants really good sushi at an affordable price.  Great job!

So I tried contacting customer service, but waiting on hold for one hour is not for me. I tried calling three different times, and I kept getting transferred.  I went into this clinic two weeks ago due to a sore throat.  The lady in there told me it was just allergies and a cold, and she recommended some over the counter medications.  I asked her if she would make sure the medicines would be covered using my health savings account.  She ensured me they would be.  She also recommended an "over-the-counter" drug, Nasonex or Flonase, which is not over-the-counter.  I went and picked up the medicine, and the pharmacist basically told me the minute clinic girl did not know what she was talking about.  She told me I could go back over, but by that time, there was a line.  In my world, time is money, and I wasted a bunch of time at this place. I left after an hour with nothing.  And I still have symptoms, which is pretty inconvenient due to my profession.  I do not recommend this clinic to anyone.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else.  I will be going to an urgent care tonight.  Don't make the same mistake I did.    If you have any more questions, feel free to email me at emily.liscom@gmail.com

I am beyond disappointed in the customer service I received at this branch.  I had a major purchase on one receipt with $20 Kohl's Cash.  When I returned a $39 sweater, they told me they would have to deduct the Kohl's cash and give me the $19.  So what if I put the sweater on another receipt?  I earned that Kohl's cash! I had to spend $100 to get that and they took it away just like that.  I can understand if I took the whole order, then take my $20 back.  If you ever shop here, be sure to put your Kohl's cash item on another receipt.  They will take that $20 back if you have ANY returns.  I am completely disappointed in Kohl's.

We ordered many things, but one thing that really bothered me is we had a 10 year old sitting at the table who really wanted dough.  I had to ask the server for dough.  She brought some really hard dough to the table and he could barely pull it apart.  It wasn't even on a platter.  I feel like it was old dough from another table.  We also ordered the zany ziti with the big rig sauce.   It came with NO big rig sauce, so we decided we would be nice and not say anything and order it on the side.  It never came.  We mentioned it, and the server told us she put it in.  It came as she was boxing our stuff up.  We didn't eat it because of this.  But she told us we could take it home, and she CHARGED us for it!!! We could not believe it.  I love this Oreganos, but the server took no responsibility for this issue, and she took complete advantage of us as nice customers.  I worked in the service industry for 5 years, and I would have totally comped it.

Just walked in here. I needed something specific. Two ladies that were working were chit chatting in the back. I waited for them to finish. Then one of them goes up to a customer and reprimands her for "double dipping." I felt so bad for the girl as she apologized. The lady told her, "We're going to have to throw that out now." I would imagine she wouldn't have needed to do it if any one of them would have helped her. I walked around a bit more and nobody was around to help so I just left. This location isn't going to get my business.

This place is so top notch.  I love being able to see pictures of the sushi on the menu.  (That is how you know a place is GOOD) Always fresh, and tastes outstanding.  I would eat every roll on the menu if I could, but I highly recommend the Arizona Roll, and the Candy Cane Roll.  Can't wait to go again!

** Thank you Pita Jungle for getting back to me:)  They completely went above and beyond to make it right.  I will surely be returning!   I am so irritated with the customer service for Pita Jungle.  We ordered take out one night, and when we got back they put the wrong hummus in the bag.  One of my favorite parts of Pita Jungle is the cilantro hummus.  I emailed to see if we could get a voucher or something for the hummus and nobody responded.  I know it is a small request and it may seem petty, but it is the principal.  I could have gone back in, but we were busy!  Knowing they are blowing me off kind of makes me never want to go back.   I am not a fan of Pita Jungle right now.  A small email would have made it right.

I absolutely love this place!  We went in for Happy Hour and we got the Philly Roll, Atlantic Roll, potstickers, edamame, AND calamari.  It was awesome, and so was our bill.  The service was amazing, and the manager (Eddie) was on the floor helping out and assisting with the servers, which is something I always notice.  We left very full and very happy!! If you like sushi and happy hour, I highly recommend this place!

I had an appointment for a month to have someone groom my dog.  When I went in on 12/22/14, she was there, but she gave my dog to someone else.  When someone asks for someone specifically, they should never be given to another groomer.  We have a Goldendoodle.  No dog should not be groomed by someone else if their owner specifically requests a groomer.  I told her not to shave the bridge of his nose, and the bridge of his nose was shaved when he was done.  I found this visit very frustrating, and I will not be returning.   If you have any additional questions, please email me at emily.liscom@gmail.com.

Employees were very helpful with an exchange we recently made.  Although the person in the check out failed to tell us the shoes were $15 cheaper.  The shoes we were exchanging were never worn and still in the box.  I let her know at the checkout that I would like to return, and then repurchase.  She told me that it's an exchange and that I can not.  As a consumer, it is my right.   It shouldn't matter.  She went ahead and did not do what I requested, and told me that I will be able to use my $20 when I buy $50, so it doesn't matter anyway.  I am so disappointed in the customer service with this store.

Lauren really knows hair!  She is always up-to-date on the latest techniques, and she is very knowledgable on a wide range.  I have been going to her since I lived in Arizona, and I highly recommend her to anybody new in the area.

From the minute I walked in, this place was amazing.  I had a sinus infection, and it was getting worse by the minute.  I really needed medicine fast.  They got me in and out with medicine in a little under 45 minutes.  Service was fantastic.  I wish I could remember the name of the P.A., but I can not.  She was so helpful:) Thank you!!!

My visit here was probably the best experience I have ever had in a medical office.  Everyone was very kind and efficient.  I was greeted so kindly and I spent no time in the waiting room.  After the nurse took my vitals, she showed me to a room.  Shortly after, the doctor arrived.  She was very thorough and wanted to make sure she had my medical history correct.  I felt like I was in very good hands when I visited this clinic.  It was just the right amount of time to spend in a doctor's office.  If you are looking for a great medical center, you might want to check this one out.
