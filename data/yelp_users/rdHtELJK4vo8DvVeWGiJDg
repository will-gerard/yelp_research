The food is always good when I come here! I usually don't come very often unless I'm having ramen cravings, but the chashu ramen is always the way to go! So much flavor in the broth and the sushi is just as good! Usually you can tell when sushi is old or pre-made because the seaweed inside will be soggy and stringy, however I've never had a problem with that with the sushi here, it has always tasted fresh. I wish I knew the servers name who always waits on me, he's very very attentive and friendly and was always there with refills. I will always come in here whenever I'm in the area

I've been coming here for a few years now and the spicy pork bulgogi is just as amazing every time! The service is very friendly and the food comes out in a very timely matter. They also make sure your water is always full which is a huge thing for me! I always go with the spicy pork bulgogi but I also tried to kimchi fried rice tonight and it was good but lacked flavor, the fried egg on top was delicious however...

I came in at 9pm with two friends and prior to coming in I made sure to check the closing hours because as a server myself, I try not to be rude and come in to eat right before closing. Upon coming into a completely empty restaurant, I asked if they were closed, even though the hours said 10pm on yelp. The gentleman said they closed at 9:30... didn't seem right. I ordered the spicy pork dish, the Vegas roll and shrimp tempura roll. The Vegas roll had little to no eel, and barely any avocado or cream cheese. The rice tasted like old, re-cooked rice, would definitely not recommend the sushi here AT ALL, you are probably better off chewing cardboard. The pork was ok, not terrible. I enjoyed the side dishes of pickled cucumber and radish than I did the actual food... Our server was rude and although he did refill our drinks at the very end, during the entire course of the meal he sat at a table on his phone while the other female server seemed to do all the work. Clean the tables, give us our side dishes, etc. This review gets 2 stars instead of 1 because she was friendly and nice. I will however not ever return here, for good Korean go to Hodori or Cho dang

I've been coming here twice a month since I moved into my apartment down the street and I anticipate that even if I move I will drive the distance to continue coming here. All the staff is very friendly and are nothing short of phenomenal at the work they do. I have never once received a bad manicure or pedicure and always leave very happy. The staff makes sure you are taken care of and leave satisfied with your service and looking forward to your next return.

First things first: pork belly toast with the sriracha aioli is something I wish I could begin and end every day with. I came in on Tuesday night at around 7:30 with a party of 12 and our server (forgot to ask his name sadly) was off the bat super flexible when we asked to add another high 4-top to our now party of 14-15 and overall extremely accommodating, funny, and friendly. As someone who works in the service industry I understand the stresses that come with large parties, but he handled it very well. Our table shared the roasted Brussels sprouts, prosciutto deviled eggs (worth killing over), soft pretzels & provolone fondue (wish pretzels were a little more salted), ma...the meatloaf?!, shrimp & pork belly ramen (can't you tell I love pork belly?), prime rib dip, and some other stuff I can't remember the name of. Overall, loved the cool fusion of foods going on and how well they maintained an abundance of flavors in all their dishes. Especially thought it was cool my ramen came with chopsticks, that's how you know this place is legit! And one last shout out to our cool ass server

The inside is very clean and modern looking! The waterfall lux sign is a beautiful touch to the salon and all the workers are very friendly and always greet everyone with a smile! Great service and good music is usually playing. I am very satisfied with what they did to my nails and will definitely be coming back often! The receptionist Angela is very funny and helpful as well :-)

I've been here a total of two times now, both through the drive thru. The first time I ordered a guava smoothie, the club sandwich, and a lemon muffin top, I was very impressed and knew I would be coming back! The bread on the sandwich was what sold me, however the sandwich itself I found to be a little overly mayo-d. Today I picked up some pancakes with a side of bacon and sausage and I think they might be the best pancakes I've ever had. Thick, fluffy, and the home-made caramel syrup tops it off nicely by not being overly sweet. So far, so good. I will be back!

Good but not GREAT. Have been here a few times, twice for lunch and once for dinner. The first time I went, a co-worker and I went for lunch before our shift and ordered some specialty rolls (don't remember the names but one was on a bed of flames) and some other meat and rice dish. Service was friendly and for the most part, attentive. Specialty roll was just alright... found it to be mostly mayonnaise and crab meat. Second time I went I went for dinner with 2 girlfriends and we had drinks, assortment of sashimi, and some pork belly. The server was AMAZING, very very kind and polite, even asked his name (which I unfortunately forgot) and conversed with him. However, this most recent visit, is the reason for this review. Came in with another co-worker before shift once again and were sat in the very corner of the restaurant. We weren't greeted for at least 10 minutes which wouldn't have been as big an issue were it not for us to take notice to our server standing around chatting and laughing with friends. As soon as he approached us his first statement was, "are you ready to order?" said impatiently. We said not quite and (still without any drinks) and he said, "i'll come back," still without grabbing a drink order, or introducing himself. We had to ASK him for the sushi menu AND he had turned around so quickly to walk away i had to ask him if we could have waters before he was too far away. He came back one more time and we were ready to order, we ordered our meal without difficulty or confusion and once i finished talking and handed him the menu he snatched it from my hands and stared at me with a demeaning look. So obvious that even my friend asked if i knew him or if i noticed his mannerisms. Never refilled drinks, had to get up to the booth him and his fellow employee were sitting at, texting, and eating, to ask for a to-go box seeing as my friend and i were in a rush. He acted as if us interrupting his mid-day snack was so inconvenient for him. Sorry, let me come back when you are done eating okay? Anyways, i've had good and bad service from many places but this one was service bad enough to make me write this post at all.

Really awesome place, long open bar with huge projection screen playing random anime, love the concept and the bar. Staff is real friendly and there's great appetizers from 3-6pm. Lychee martini was good, strong, but good. For appetizers tried the ginger pork and the almond chicken, both were very flavorful and good amount of meat. Overcoming sickness so I was still a little stuffed up and I ordered the lemon grass soup. I must say it definitely swept me off my feet, perfect flavor and great amount of spice. It is a little on the spicy side, but I love love heat! I will most likely return with some friends. I can see this place getting real busy on a Friday or Saturday night.

I knew it would be love as soon as I heard, "all the ingredients are natural." I am always a fan of businesses that strive for local/natural product. What sold me next was the interesting flavors they offered. There was a Hop Knot IPA ice cream, at first I was skeptical but, WOW, it was actually amazing. I described it as a beer float. As someone who loves beer, I loved sampling this creamy, sweet, beer-flavored, frozen treat. I also sampled the mint chip in which they use REAL mint leaves and it makes all the difference! Very refreshing. I ultimately sided with my all time favorite (and apparently a favorite among most guests) the salted caramel. I loved that salt could actually be picked up when I took bites/licks of the caramel. A little pricey but understandable considering the ingredients used. The man behind the counter who helped me was very informative and kind, appreciated his service! I will come back whenever I'm in this area next and craving some ice cream.
