this is my favorite bar ever. cheap, quiet, good local live bands, a view of doofus' falling on an ice rink, and a nice patio with token alley cat. fav-o-rite.

I'm a huge fan of SMoCA! The museum is beautifully designed and kept. The staff/docents are wonderful and knowledgeable. SMoCA is a great place to take an afternoon trip too. Alway a fantastic and inspiring visit.

I went here for the first time this weekend after moving down the street.  I was super pleased with how great the interior looked and how clean and organized things were.   I found two adorable little dresses and a great button down for my boyf. In total, I think I spent $10 and am extremely satisfied.  I'll be back!

I go to Martha's as often as possible after a tip came from some girls i worked with- I LOVE it! Delicious sandwiches and salads. I highly recommend it to all of my friends and make excuses to have lunch dates so I can go there.

This place is wonderful! I was able to enjoy a sneak peek and loved every second of it. The menu was sensational and the wines were to die for.  I especially enjoyed the staff! They were extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Our server was so sweet and charming.  I will definitely be back when it opens (tonight!) regularly!

So glad to have an authentic coffee shop walking distance from our office! Great, open floor plan with a killer atmosphere. This will definitely be my friends and my new favorite place to head to for a coffee break. Welcome to the neighborhood, Sip!
