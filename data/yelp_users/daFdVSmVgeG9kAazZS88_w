They told me 30 minutes for my prescription, 45 tops. I came at 50 just to be sure. They told me another hour. It was a cruel joke when I feel like I am dying inside.

This place is as good as it gets. The have several boutiques and enough chic and shabby furniture to ooo and ahhh at.   The store is pretty clean and the staff was all very nice. It is definitely one of my favorite places to go.   They have a lot of really neat furniture some all the way back to early 1800's   IT is literally my girlfriends dream come true. She couldn't get enough and was so excited to take her mom and all her sisters.

Love this gelato! The owners can seem a little short and rude sometimes but I can see why, they have to deal with people who can't make up their minds on what flavor they want

The owner is super nice and the environment is friendly. I got the Dylan is what it is called. Green chillies chicken bacon chipotle dressing. It came as a wrap. It is extremely delicious. I just feel the serving size was a little small. The potato salad was good. The cost was about 8 bucks for everything. From this one sandwich I wouldn't label it as the end all sandwich shop.

I have been going here for years and never had a complaint till today. The staff was rude for the first time ever. They messed up my order because they were so abrupt and short with me. When we got our food and started eating it didn't taste the same as it did last time. The carne Asada was so chewy and tasted freezer burnt. I am so sad, because this really was one of my favorite taco places. :(

Paid for extra meat and veggies, went back when I opened the box to find neither. They just shrugged. It didn't help they didn't speak English. 10 dollars gone for a 5 dollar meal. Thank grilled ave.

Never do business with these people. I called on the phone and talked to one of the most rude individuals I have ever spoken too. Surprise! I didn't use them to do the job. I don't know what their work looks like but I guarantee there are other companies out there who will do a great job AND have great customer service.

Let us be honest with our selves. This place is tasty.  Eat and eat and eat. The only problem is the total of your purchase will surprise you and get pretty high pretty quick.

I would have given it 3 stars but the 4 and a half stars it already has is way to high, I am trying to bring this place down to earth. It's not bad, but they use the lowest quality rice possible. There was very little meat in the meals they gave us and they weren't very good serving sizes. They tasted good, but I don't have any urge to say this is the best food I have ever had. Please if you are going to leave a revue for this place, make sure you know what great food is before hand.

Please stop giving this place good reviews! Just because you ate dog food back home in Detroit doesn't mean it's good! It smelt like a portapoty inside and I walked out literally smelling like a fry cook. If you decide to eat there please make sure you eat outside. You might enjoy your dog food a little bit more.

Terrible coffee cake. Great chicken sandwich. Very impressed with what the cluck. It has hearty seasonings which you don't expect from a deep fried chicken. A little bit of spice too! The home made pickle made it. They got the food out to me super fast. I was impressed. But to receive a 5 star rating everything has to be good. And their cake wasn't great. Also their card reader machine stopped working. So it took 5 minutes to just place an order.

Wow did my mouth just experience that heaven... Smoked Tri Tip steak sandwich, with a chimichurri sauce that was sent from heaven. Had a Butterscotch Beer Soda(non alcoholic) that was liquid candy! Haven't had something taste that good in a while!!!
