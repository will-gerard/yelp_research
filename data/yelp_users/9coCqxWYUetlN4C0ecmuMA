Very beautiful park and great for puppies who love to run and play in the water. However this is not a place for small dogs. The larger breeds that go there are aggressive and to make it worse have careless owners. I took my two small dogs there Thursday morning and my weenie dog who is very gentle and great with other dogs was cornered and was being held down by the neck. No other owners were helping me get their dogs off of mine. Needless to say we will not be going back and will not suggest this park to others who want a safe environment for their babies.

Great price and even better sushi. Thick cuts and delicious sauces! Try the double spicy!

Best dog park ever! Large area for running and playing. The people there are fantastic. They are all regulars and remember your dogs name. Everyone there is sweet and the dogs are 99% well mannered. I enjoy taking my babies there and they love going and seeing their friends.   FYI - Closed on Thursdays
