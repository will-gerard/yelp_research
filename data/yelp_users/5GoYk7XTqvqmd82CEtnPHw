I am EXTREMELY happy with my results. Dr. Malek is a true artist and exceptional surgeon.  I had an implant exchange and needed extensive reconstruction from a botched boob job from a Vegas surgeon years ago.  Two of my issues were symmastia (I had no space in between breasts) and "bottoming out" or "double bubble" (implant was lower than breast) and the nipples were uneven.  The old implants were too large and out of all of the surgeons I consulted with, Dr. Malek was the only one who was honest enough to tell me that I needed to go smaller to achieve my results.  I was resistant at first but I had a gut feeling he knew what he was talking about and I'm thankful that I listened and chose him.  All of these issues were corrected as he did an amazing job. Also, 200 cc's smaller but since he chose high profile implants, I'm still a D cup :)  He is a meticulous perfectionist and also provides the utmost individualized care.  I highly recommend him.

I have been here since 2009, and out of all the apt.'s I have lived in, this is one of the few places that the staff actually cares for the tenants.  They address every concern, everyone pays the same rent (i.e. all studio's one price, 1 BR's same price, unlike other properties which the rates altered day to day as I'm learning while helping a friend find an apt.)  They also maintain the property well.

I stayed here last year and about to stay again next month.  I had a balcony suite with a nice view, the room was clean and the staff was attentive.  I've read some of the other reviews but I think a lot of it has to do with preference. If you want easy access to the strip/gaming/tourist attractions, then this may not be the place.  However, if you want more privacy, a little distance from all the commotion, it's perfect.  Everything is so large and spread out in Vegas (which I have previously lived for 9 years) so it's a long walk to ANYTHING. Since I lived there before and not a gambler, I love the non-gaming/non-smoking aspect of the property.  I try not to eat out too much so the kitchenette is one of the main reasons I'm staying here again.  The Hotel Operations Coordinator was very accommodating and I had a great stay.  It's kind of hard to escape the noise anywhere in Vegas so I'm always equipped with ear plugs & white noise app whenever I travel :)

I was at the same Whitney Cummings show last night as the other reviewer. She not only read off all her jokes from previous roasts, she encouraged the audience to call out reapetedly, pausing & saying "what"? SEVERAL times, fishing for a joke as well as filling time.  I did Lol a lot but was not worth the $30.     I've been to this venue several times and they have raised their prices, the drinks are watered down..my dirty had more olive juice than it did vodka and I'd seen others delivered that looked the same...olive juice...$15 and when you remove the 4 huge olives in it, you're left with not much more than a shot....of olive juice. Not wanting to waste any more $$ on bad drinks, ordered a soft drink which used to be $3.75, now $5.75.   It also feels like they have moved the tables even closer together than they were before, packing people in like sardines. Tempe improv getting the same.    PLEASE stop being so greedy!  & take some notes from Irvine Improv in CA. I was going to catch Bobby Lee @ S.U.L. in May, but I'm too turned off by my last few visits and will catch him somewhere else.  Prices are about the same in Irvine, but you get your money's worth.  And space! :)

I have been here before and they did a good job, but just went in today and it was 6:35p. Their hours on the door say open until 730p. I just wanted a basic pedi, & they said they put all their stuff away and could I come back tomorrow. I will do one better and not come back at all.  That's bad business. One of the Techs was sitting with her purse ready to go, so Pro Nails, if you want to leave at 630 then please make your hours until 630.

I also highly recommend Vet to You.  Dr. Gilchrist and Alex are great.  I have an almost 14 year old cat who I can't take out to the vet anymore.  The last couple times upset him so much that he did not eat for days and I had to give him appetite stimulants and I didn't want to keep putting him through that.  What I really like besides their professionalism, good listening and thorough advice, Dr. Gilchrist will not do any unnecessary tests as many docs do to add up your bill.  Both he and Alex are caring and are really good with following up and checking on their patient.

I'm not a complainer as all of my other reviews of businesses on here are all positive, but after visiting this place a second time, I feel compelled to speak my opinion.  5 stars for atmosphere and service, but I give it one star because the servings, food and drink are tiny yet expensive!  I have no problem paying $15 for a top shelf dirty martini, but the portion size is a little more than a Dixie cup!  They're $20 at Mastros but you get a large martini glass plus the shaker with more in it.  The second time I went to B&T, I decided to try another drink.  I tried Long Island and kettle & cranberry.  Very heavy glasses with no volume for the liquid.  Ripoff.  I willingly pay top shelf prices but Bitter & Twisted, STOP  being so lame with your portions!  The food too! Everyone in my party ordered food and the portions were very small for the price. $15 for a salad that you could fit in your hand. Take some tips from Postinos for those.

This place has definitely improved!  Always liked the atmosphere.  Last 2 times I've gone have been great.  Food is really good and that popcorn addicting! :)

Saw their ad in New Times, was putting off repairing my cracked screen knowing it would be expensive at apple store.  Price & service great!  & discounts for referrals. Was fixed in 40 min! Very happy & definitely recommend!
