The food was excellent. Maybe a little too much butter, but its a once in a while meal... The food came out on their very hot plates and the wine was great. We had a group dinner for the company and they were very attentive to everyone. All in all it was great experience and I would eat there again.

I have been here so far quite a few times and have not been disappointed yet. Great atmosphere, great food, great live music on fridays and saturdays. I have been here for both dinner and drink and for lunch and a beer. The atmosphere is always laid back and never really uncomfortable. Looking for a great irish pub experience here in phx, az.... Rosie McCaffrey's is your place for small and quaint. Enjoy.

The only reason I give this place a four star rating is because of the Gyro... It is pretty good. Not the best, but definitely good. the burgers use to be way better. I went here recently after having moved away and coming back and this was just tragic. It use to be one of my kids and I favorite places for a quick stop in and bite to eat.

For thin crust pizza Johnnies is the way to go. I am not a fan of thick crust, but can eat it if the pizza is absolutely awesome. I am not impressed with most pizza places out here, so when my honey introduced me to Johnnie's thin crust pizza it has become one of my faves.

We ventured in last weekend and had a great meal and some good Italian beer. Loved the food. We ordered several Pizzas and a pasta dish. Everyone was fully satisfied. Every thing was delicious and we will definitely be going back. The servers were great and very personable.

First off... the smoking section is to open and close to the people waiting to be called for their tables... I don't mind this so much as i hate watching a stand-in hostess stuff her face with crackers while we wait 20 minutes (which turned in to longer, of course while people that got there after us went in before we did...) We get to our table and get the most lethargic and unresponsive waitress we could possibly get. Great we get our order in with no feedback or questions on how we want anything cooked or substitutes on sides or how we want our potatoes... absolutely unacceptable. Get our drinks and my SO's drink cup has a layer of grease film on the top of his Extremely watered down coke... yummy. Menus left on the table, extra silver on the table. Our waitress didn't even clear anything off and just let it all pile up. We ordered calamari and get this microwaved, freeze burn crap that tasted like rubber on some pieces and gushy  on others... gross. Look at the extra plate left on the other side of our already cluttered table and it had food flecks on it.... Absolutely disgusting. Will NEVER go back there again. bad bad bad.

Was invited to try a new idea appetizer tonight and it was full of flavor and absolutely great. It was a nacho cheesy fried roll and absolutely yummy. I had the Stromboli (the Momma Meat lovers) tonight and couldn't be happier. It was rich and flavorful. I love this place. It is always welcoming and pleasant. I always have two thumbs up for Daddy Dukes.

This review is based on the times we have been there for dinner.  I have had seafood stew that is quite good, a shepherds pie the was good, great Irish beer and nice low hum of conversation. We have eaten at two of the bars in different areas of the restaurant and both times were pleasant. The bar tenders were attentive and genial. We ate in the main dining area at a tall table, I think the seats could be a better height, but that is neither here nor there. Didn't affect my opinion of the place. Our servers in the main dining area were attentive and on the go, it was a busy night, and we were never forgotten. It was overall a good experience each time and has kept us coming back again and again.

Service was awful. The young man came up and asked me if he could help me. I had to repeatedly tell him what my daughter wanted he still couldn't figure it out. How hard is an ice blended cappuccino?  Almost forgot to ask me what I wanted and then never asked me what flavor, then turned around and ignored us for a few minutes and then told us someone else would help us after he had already taken our order. I will never step foot in there again. I would rather get coffee from a circle K.
