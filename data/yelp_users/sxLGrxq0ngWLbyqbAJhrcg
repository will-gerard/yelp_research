Food is decent. I ordered online, they said it would be 50 minutes. I waited an hour and twenty minutes before I called them just to be told my order wasn't even out yet. They said it would be right over. Took another half hour and the food wasn't even that hot.

Worst drunken noodles ever. Just taste like pepper on noodles with half cooked vegetables.

Very good. First time here. I got a gyro. I like the concept. Kind of like chipotle for Mediterranean food. The gyro I got was huge as well. Lots of meat and toppings. Well worth it.
