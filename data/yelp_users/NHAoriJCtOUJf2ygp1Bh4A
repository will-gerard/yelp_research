Just stopped in for a quick bathroom break and to buy a cold.drink. This is the cleanest McDonald's location I have seen I think.ever!  I was at the 75TH Ave and Bell Rd location yesterday and it was filthy! Bathrooms, dining room beverage station all sticky dirty hadn't been cleaned thoroughly in months. Not his location!  All stainless was shining, bathroom had just been cleaned thoroughly and smelled great? And beverage station was spotless!   Props to the manager!!

I started eating gluten free pizza a few years ago, mostly because my son and daughter are gluten intolerant, and I wanted to see how it would taste.  Much to my surprise and delight, it was really tasty.  I liked the slightly thinner, toothy texture of the crust and most of all, I felt fantastic after eating several slices.  I was full, but not bloated, and felt great the next day, not how I usually feel after eating regular pizza.  Needless to say, about once a week, when my husband and I were exhausted and wanted to spoil ourselves, we would get a GF pizza each.  The Happy Valley/Lake Pleasant location was always busy, with great service, and perfectly cooked crusts when we ordered them well done.  After moving south a few miles, we were excited to find this location within a 5 minute drive of our new house.  After three tries, I have to say that I will never order pizza from this location again.  The first visit, I expected the same good pizza I was used to, so I didn't check it, and got home to find a really undercooked crust, with too much cheese (which didn't help the over-moist crust) and mostly cool toppings.  Too tired to return, I muddled through.   Second chance Barro's, but again, undercooked and soggy and cold.  (Remember, it's only 5 minutes from my house, and I arrive when they tell me to and always have to wait)  This time, I had a little more energy, and was a lot more hungry, so I brought my pizza back.  I told the person at the counter that I had ordered the pizza well done, and it was not only not well done, it was undercooked.  She took the pizza back to the kitchen, and a large man who said he was the manager came out.  He said he had cooked the pizza and that it was well done.  He was agressive and rude, and basically told me that I could take the pizza or leave it.  I was shocked and told him I wanted a pizza that was cooked well done and that was not well done, so after telling me again that I was wrong (whatever happened to the customer is always right?)  he grudgingly agreed to make a new pizza.  Waiting for 15-20 minutes, I kept thinking "there is no way I'm getting a well done pizza when they know I am sitting out here waiting for it"   I took the pizza home and sure enough it was soft and not crispy at all.   Third chance Barro's - it had been many weeks, and I had forgotten about the cooking issues, so I grabbed the pizzas, (this time we were late per their instructions, but still had to wait 5 minutes) went home and sat on the couch and opened the box to find a soggy, cold pizza with the cheese barely melted.  I put it in the toaster oven for about 15 minutes, and it finally crisped up and got hot.  Finally it tasted like what I remembered eating at the Happy Valley/Lake Pleasant location!  Sorry guys, but if I want to cook my own pizza I'll make it with fresher ingredients and non-processed crust.

Met my family here for my son's 31st birthday.  The decor is simple but cozy, and it didn't hurt that we had a thunderstorm during dinner.  My son said he wants his house to look like the interior of the restaurant.  Our waiter was extrememely attentive, and even though our water glasses were teeny tiny, they were never empty.  The bussers were equally watchful and dishes were cleared promptly, glasses refilled, and appropriate silverware was always provided before the food.  Four of the party of six are present or former service industry folks, so we all really appreciated the service in this age of often feeling as if the waitstaff are doing you a favor waiting on you.  We started with the mac and cheese, fried deviled eggs, and roasted squash.  I am watching the middle age spread, so I only had one bite of the mac and cheese, but it was perection.  Excellent balance of cheeses (there are 4) and the thick cavatappi pasta was cooked just right.  Everyone else raved about the eggs and their dipping sauce, and the squash was finished off by my gluten free son.  Two folks had the osso buco, and literally scraped their plates clean - I'm guessing it was good?  One had the short ribs, and that disappeared quickly.  Two of us had the chicken, which was served with a bacon biscuit stuffing that was amazingly crispy and warm and soft all at the same time.  The cheeseburger was so big and filling my husband could not finish more than about 2/3 of it.  We all shared the s'mores plate, coconut cake, and some GF deserts we had brought for my son (which the server was nice enough to keep hidden and serve with a candle at the appropriate time)  The s'mores plate has squares of marshmallows that are perfectly roasted, small squares of graham crackers, an artistic swirl of creamy peanut butter (I'm assuming everything was house made) and, wait for it, chocolate covered bacon!  I am dieting and have a weigh in tomorrow, but I just did not care - I can't wait to tell my counselor I had chocolate covered bacon just to see her face!!!  Can't wait for an excuse to go back (it's a bit far from my house).  Oh, and it was ridiculously inexpensive!  $358 (not including tip) for six entrees, three appetizers, and three deserts, a bottle of wine (plus three glasses), 7 coctails and a cup of java!
