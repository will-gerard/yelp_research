Having had numerous favorable experiences at Coronado Cafe in the past, we were deeply disappointed at our most recent, and regrettably probably our last visit.  The evening was off to a great start with the predictably excellent crab cakes.  While the driver scallops were equally delicious, the chimichurri-style rib-eye was barely edible.  Despite being cooked properly - medium rare - the meat had a strange after taste.  After struggling with the steak - and subsisting on two shared scallops in exchange for some steak  - not an even trade by ANY measure - we told our waiter of the disappointment, at which point he spirited away the plate.  Since I was soon to be finished with the scallops (having shared half with my dining partner with the barely edible steak).  The waiter provided some explanation behind the problem with the steak when he advised that the chimichurri included vinegar and lime - two odd ingredients for a rib-eye, which accounted for the bitter after taste.  The response of Coronado to apparently weigh the returned entree to determine the "discount"  was an insult as it suggested that we should have either been forced to eat alone (i.e., return the steak after the first bite) rather than enjoy our meal together.  Had they tasted the meat rather than focused on the weight perhaps they would have realized how unpleasant the meal was.  As we have ample other dining options available to us on our "short" list, we will not be returning anytime soon to Coronado Bill and Bob Phoenix

Just had a 1930's art deco floor lamp refurbished.  When picking it up, The owner suggested a tasteful shade to replace the 1970s vintage shade.  It is apparent most reviewers do not share the dry sense of humor of the owner.  The store is packed with interesting pieces that you are unlikely to find at the other lighting galleries in town or big box stores.   Given the fragile nature of the merchandise, not a good place to bring your 3 year olds (or allow them to run in excitedly ahead of you), as glass does break easily, and it is not difficult to imagine broken merchandise and argumentative parents blaming the store owner for the mishap.

We were here years earlier, shortly after moving to Phoenix to see what it was all about.  Our impression then was so-so, but not worth writing about.  Food was OK, but not good enough to draw us back.   Friday night we attended a birthday for a friend of ours, and while we dine out frequently, including several higher end restaurants (Razz's, Caffe Daniel, Different Point of View and Urban Vine), were a bit taken aback by the steak prices.  My 8 oz. Filet was OK, and thankfully cooked properly at medium rare.  When I requested steak sauce, the server offered A-1 and another major brand of bottled sauce, as well as their own peppercorn sauce.  While I am well aware of rising beef prices - although $55 for an 8 oz. filet seemed on the high side - I was not aware that pepper prices had risen as well.  Sorry, but $4.50 for peppercorn sauce to accompany a $55 steak was outrageous.  It was not any better than the bottled Fresh and Easy brand sauce I use at home.  Other fine steak purveyors in Phoenix provide such accompaniments as part of the entree, which frankly one expects - especially at Durant's prices.  Such nickel and dining of patrons has no place at a fine dining establishment.   Ambience was unchanged from our visit in 2005 - not unpleasant, but quite dated.

We needed someone to install our replacement automatic gate opener and they promptly were able to come out to the house and get the job done quickly and reasonably.  Scott the owner came out personally and I was impressed with his knowledge and professionalism.  I am keeping the business close at hand as this is a company that you want to use whenever a job arises that they can do - and to recommend to friends.

We don't know if we are somehow jinxed, but while we have had a favorable opinion of the food, the restaurant cannot seem to connect the dots with service.  Tonight was a prime example - a relatively quiet Sunday evening around 7:30.  We sat at the bar and placed our order for dinner.  The soup and bread came out uneventfully, but it went downhill after that.  The waitress / bartender brought out my entree, the Risotto, and instead of what my partner had ordered - their pork chop - she brought out the pot roast for him  Then she proceeded to tell us that she had punched in the order wrong, and added that they were out of the port chops - this after I had my meal in front of me.  We were ready to walk out of the restaurant at that point, and then a chef came out and suddenly advised us that they were not out of pork chops.  Knowing that the chop is cooked on the entire rack from prior visits (hence "the limited availability") we then knew that either the waitress and/or the kitchen had initially lied to us to foist an unwanted entree item on us.  15 minutes later, after I had stalled in eating my meal so I would not be finished before the other entree arrived we finally had the second meal.  All in all, the night was a very stressful and unpleasant ordeal.  Several visits earlier, our entire dinner order was "lost" - this after we waited for 40 minutes after finishing the soup.  While the food has generally been pretty good, the service level will take this restaurant off of our list, which is a shame since we live only a half mile away, and like to support all of the neighborhood establishments.

We stumbled across Thirteen North having gone to the predecessor high end Italian restaurant they took over a couple of times - and were curious to see what replaced it.  We have been going back ever since, typically once a week and sometimes more frequently.  The food is always consistent, and sometimes the Chef specials are down right spectacular.  Cocktails a wonderful bargain, aside from their promotional specials on their namesake day of the month.  Perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of the dining experience beyond the food (which is reason enough) is the commraradie among the patrons and the friendliness of the staff. We prefer the bar for maximum impact on both fronts.  You feel that the the owners and their staff all genuinely enjoy working there, and they make the guests feel very at home.  Bill and Bob, Phoenix

Went back for a return visit and were surprised to see the addition of entrees.  French Onion soup was superb, as was the crab cake appetizer, and our dinners (Pork Tenderloin and Hangar Steak with Marsala wine sauce and mushrooms). Pork was juicy and sauce was just right with the apples lightly cooked but still with a bit of a crunch, and the steak was cooked just as ordered - medium rare.

Were able to check out Johnny and Linda's latest culinary adventure, having missed Sens since they moved uptown to Thomas and Central.  Same predictably good food as Sens in a very pleasant setting, with the always friendly staff.    We went after only the first week, and they seemed to have ironed out the opening jitters.  As with Sens, Sochu will be our go to restaurant for Asian cuisine.  The Tapas menu was expanded and updated from Sens, and they've added some entree items as well.  Bill and Bob Phoenix

Since our so-so experience with the pork entree (looked pretty with the grill marks, but too dry due to the absence of sufficient fat or bone), we have ventured back to the Vine twice, and I am pleased to report that both visits were back up to the standards that we had come to expect from this innovative neighborhood restaurant.  Sampled the bag on our last visit with a delicious mushroom appetizer special and soup - all of which we shared, providing a generous meal for the two of us.  Only recommendation is to remember to ask for their tasty sour dough bread when you order soup, as it is served on request (so as not to waste it for those who don't want it).  No extra charge, just ask the server when you order...
