Oh my diner oh my diner oh my Diii-ner on Roosevelt--  So I usually don't eat at diners because food ain't all that great.  But where there is jackfruit I will follow.  Welcome Diner on Roosevelt and 10th Streets sells a lot of burgers and booze but they also offer a jackfruit po'boy ($8) and several other interesting veggie dishes.  Even though I fancy the taste of sweet, juicy, ripe jackfruit, it's also scrumptious when cooked and used like a vegetable.  This is the fourth spot where I've had jackfruit in a sandwich (or taco) and 'twas delicious.    Paired with a cabbage slaw that adds crunch to the 'wich, the flavor was mild and hearty.  I requested no BBQ sauce because that sickly sweetness would have disturbed the taste of the fruit.  My only regret is no side was included in the price.  Welcome Diner also sells a fried green tomato sammich. ($8.5)  Doesn't that sound delicious?   [crickets]  Doesn't it?  Okay, well maybe it's just me.  And lesson learned:   "Sounding" delicious and tasting delicious are two entirely different senses.  The sourdough was oily, toasted with a few slices of breaded fried tomatoes laid in-between.  And a fried tomato is...well...it tastes...uhhhh...urrrr...well...well, at least it's a vegetable, damn it Janet.    No side either.   If it wasn't for the arugula, corn relish, and ranch dressing on the sandwich, it would have been a complete disappointment.  Ya' hurd meh?  Complete. Disappointment.     And so TOMATO gets added to the list of things that should not be fried and passed off as food.  (That list is quite long, but let me not diverge from the review.)     Anyway, I will return someday for another jackfruit po'boy, but at $8 bucks with no side, my next visit won't be too soon.

This place is cute.  Cute!  Tables and chairs are festively colorful and it really brings out the cheer.  You won't need to order appetizers because you'll get yummy chips and salsas (red and green) and a small tortilla with ceviche.  Can't remember what fish platter we had because the menu is plentiful long, but it was a white fish served with veggies mixed in with rice.  Very delicate and pleasing.    And how, the molcajete!  Requested the waiter if we could have it served without red meat or poultry, so he brought one with seafood only.  Sizzling hot, tasty, filling.  Took home leftovers and ordered a whole fried fish to go as well.

So, I was dining at Oregano's with a couple of love birds and finally I got fed up with the pda's. Before I could stop myself I climbed on top of the table and drenched them with my ice water. "Can I enjoy my dinner please? Either cool it, or get a room. I came to review the food, not your french kissing."  I came back to reality just as appetizers arrived. I would never do that or say that to friends...or would I?    Anyway, just like Donald Trump, Oregano's does everything real BIG so we honestly didn't need to order all this food, but none of us counts calories. That's so 90's.  Here are my thoughts:  Four stars for the overly friendly staff and thin crust pizza.   pizza Not a fan of pan pizza or stuffed pizza. Oregano's really does 'em up, but looks aren't everything. I choose thin crust every time. Yummy.  Simple. Easy to eat. The thicker pies turn into cheesy messes and turn me off.  I get reminded of strings of spittle when the cheese pulls apart. I realize how this can be a turn on for some  food whores, but not me.     bruschetta  Please tell me what the big deal is. Anyone? It's bread, with stuff on top - but it's not pizza. If that's your thing, fine, but why do you think you fancy, huh? Oregano's bruschetta just looked sloppy. Big and sloppy. It literally looked like a mound of tomatoes with cheese and basil and some bread sticking out.  guaca-tony How do you say delicious, d-lovely, D-lectable, d-vine? How do you say D-gorgeous? D-lite? Guacamole was seasoned with basil, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. It was good, but I wish folks would stop putting tomatoes in guac.  The flavor gets watered down. What helped kick up the mildness were the accompanied cheesy salty pizza pie crust dipping slices. Good combination.  yam fries/sweet po's Yum yum piggy! Comes with aioli and sweet seasoning sprinkled on - which I could totally do without. Leave the natural sweetest alone.   salad  On a good day, crispy romaine lettuce is usually a sign of a good salad. But my first bite of Oregano's salad left me with the taste of bag/packaging in my mouth. It wasn't overpowering enough to stop eating, but a disappointment is just that. I regretted not requesting spinach in place of romaine.  BEGIN SIDE NOTE Best salad at Oregano's: the delicious spinach salad with red onions, marinated portobello shrooms, roasted red bell pepper, and avocado dressing. But that's just a memory now. This salad was removed from the menu. Whose dumb  idea was that? END SIDE NOTE  Veggie Wedgie sandwich.   Skip it. The foccacia bread is way too thick to even enjoy the flavor of the eggplant, portobellos, spinach, and tomatoes. It's served with red pepper aioli and for some reason I had the idea in my brain this should be spicy. It was not and fell flat.  scampi The love birdies thought the scampi was delicious. I can only give their opinions because I won't eat pasta, or paste noodles as I call them. Lady is a Scampi is shrimp with corkscrew pasta in chipotle sauce, tomatoes, cilantro, cheese, and garlic. The spicier version called El Diablo Shrimp Pasta is in chipotle cream sauce with fettuccine, cheese, and pico de gallo.  pizza cookie The only dessert they serve. It's warm and topped with ice cream, but way sweet and a little raw. If that's how you go down on your cookies, go 'head playa! (Not playa as in the beach, playa as in play-er.)

Start with one penny and double it, then double the double, and continue doubling daily. You would be a millionaire within 30 days. Know anyone who could pull that off? Not me! For us working folk it takes two weeks of doubling down to afford Sunday brunch for two at Wrigley Mansion ($49pp). Worth it!    The mansion is atop Telewa Trail close to the canal. The best entrance for check-in was on the SE side; upstairs from valet parking. The host was sitting there. But if you use regular parking downhill, then walk up through the pedestrian entrance on the NW side and make your way through the leftmost rooms towards the host.   Table was already assigned and we were politely escorted to a white room with big windows. Lighting was wonderful and tables adequately spaced. As soon as we settled in, a server introduced himself to us and gave the banquet 411. Then glasses were promptly filled with freely flowing mimosas. They were refilled several times while dining.  Take a moment to give thanks. God bless Abundance. My belly is always on my mind and my mind on my belly. This quality buffet presented a fun bingeful experience for my appetite. Not my waistline though, BUT I am currently in the R&D stage of an invention that burns calories as I eat. It's patented! Binge buffeting is 'bout to be the shizith!  Binge. Did I say a bad word? I don't mean it badly. I chose to hit each food section only once and use one plate at each. So I didn't overstuff - loosely speaking. Let me paint the picture: I had four courses - fruit, salad, entre, and dessert and seconds on dessert, but who's counting...   Food in the banquet room had been placed at six stations. I stood there with closed eyes pretending that everything was revolving around me. Fooooooood. Here's how it looked; going clockwise.    1. At the long center table was about five hot pots. I remember a pilaf, yellow rice, sauteed vegetable medley, salmon in lobster bisque, and a meat dish. Veggie medley was mildly seasoned. Nothing dark green in the mix so I just took a couple pieces of cauliflower. The salmon was very soft and didn't actually taste like salmon. Maybe it was because of the bisque.    2. On the south wall was the made-to-order pancake and omelet station. This section was manned and those men were a bit stingy with ingredients. Pans were small so my order for a pancake ended up being a weecake. When I asked to have it topped with fresh blueberries, about five berries were doled out.   Mr. Omelet Maker was no less stingy. I requested more veggies because he only gave a pinch of my favorites. Literally a pinch.   SUGGESTION: Let the diners self-pick ingredients into a small bowl which they can hand to the servers while ordering pancakes and omelets.  3. To the right of omelet pinchville was the dessert spread. I'm pretty sure I was the first binger to crack into them. Cheesecake, chocolate cake, 3 flavors of cupcakes, brownies, apple squares, apple tart, chocolate chip cookies, snickerdoodles, carrot cake, and numerous petite fours including one of pumpkin cheesecake. YUM!   4. A few feet from there was the fresh salad table. Strangely, choices were few and there was only one dressing, maybe two. I remember a huge bowl of crisp romaine lettuce and another bowl of mixed lettuces, also a small platter of roasted peppers and things, olives, onions, capers, pickled condiments. Not much for a salad lover.  5. Along the north wall, was the carving and seafood station. There were slabs of red meat which a server sliced thinly for you, crab legs which he cracked for you, and other sea beings like shrimp were served cold.   6. The table along the east wall was by far the longest and most diverse section - the "breakfast" station. On one end huge bowls of cantaloupe, honeydew, strawberries, pineapple, blackberries, watermelon, raspberries. The stars of the fruit show were pineapple and blackberry; both sweet and ooh so juicy. Raspberries were good. Watermelon was okay. Cantaloupe and honeydew unfortunately were unripened. Every bite seemed like rind.     The breakfast table continued with cold stuffs like cereal, yogurt, jams, croissants and danishes, muffins, and then it transitioned to the hot items. There were three or four pots, one with seasoned potatoes. Most likely there was some kind of sausage, and maybe oatmeal too.  This club definitely caters highly to its customers. Staff was bustling nonstop to clear away empty plates and refill glasses. The bill was brought to the table after we finished - a first in my buffet experience.    Minor annoyance: Every time we left the table, we'd come back to find napkins refolded and placed neatly at our places. So all morning the server was touching and retouching everyone's dirty napkin.  SUGGESTION: Stop that! Leave my napkin alone OR give me a clean one.   I would definitely come again, but at mansion prices the buffet is the only meal I would  consider returning for.

First attempt to eat at LoLo's (on a Sat afternoon) was a fail.  Groups of peops were waiting outside, and because I don't like standing around looking hopeful we left and made another date -  - this time during the week.  There was no line, but the place was still full!  We asked for a booth and within 5-7 mins one was cleaned off then we were seated.  I immediately liked the high ceiling and covered patio with some cushioned seating.  They really want you to settle in while enjoying your meal.  I also noticed there were many employees.  At one time we counted six on the floor.  I don't know how many more were in the kitchen. They all seemed quite friendly and I didn't see any bad attitudes in the young staff (a sign of good training and employee ethics).    The food was not incredible.  I might have a different review if I liked chicken and waffles, but I don't so I opted for the salmon croquette.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being fabulous, I'll give the salmon croquette a 3.  Sorry, but all I tasted was egg.  There was hardly any salmon and I won't be ordering that again.  Ever.    For veggies, the greens were delicious.  We ordered seconds.  They were not overcooked and had no meat flavoring. A+ The sweet potatoes were wonderful too.  I wasn't a fan of the cornbread muffin, it was too much flour and not enough corn.  For some folks though, that's how they like their cornbread.  If you're watching your cholesterol, though, better tell them to hold the butter or else you'll end up with a whopping scoop of the yellow stuff right on top.  Despite having said all this, I'm glad to hear of LoLo's expansion.  It could easily be like any other food chain that americans eat at everyday.  Go 'head wit'cha bad self, LoLo's, get your american dream!

Iceberg lettuce!  Iceberg lettuce!  Really!?  They need to consider upgrading to finer vegetation.  And to make the sandwich worse, the tuna fish was swimming in mayonnaise.  WTF is this $hit?

When in Rome, do as the Romans do. When in the get-toe, take yo' phat ass to Diner 50. Cool retro joint, nice staff, adequate diner food.  You'll find it on 19th Ave somewhere between Van Buren and Buckeye. Someone told me it was there and I saw it with my own eyes. It's amazing inside! (Notice how I avoided speaking of the outside.)  Not seeing a veggie burger option on the menu, I put in a special request for one of the burgers sans the meat patty. My preference for vegetarian eats was accommodated quite well with good customer service.   They fixed me up with a sand-which actually turned out to be a veggie sloppy joe of mushrooms, zucchini, onions, and peppers on bun with lettuce and tomato. Juicy! A side of medium hand cut fries with skin on (yum!) came with.   And for my sweet tooth - uh, I mean for the owners - just to let them know that the sign out front with 'apple pie' written in big letters was useful, I also ordered a slice of dessert.   Dessert First Dessert First Dessert First (That's going to be the next movement I join. You should join too, it's very proactive.)  By the way, other restaurants in the area are fast food and Mexican food.

I have no idea how the meals at My Mother's taste.  I've only been there for dessert. So this review is for the pies.    There are no less than ten pie flavors available daily.  And when you ask for a slice, be prepared for a hunk of pie.  By hunk I mean a quarter of a pie.    Now if you can remember how to do fractions, a quarter means that something has been divided into four parts.  Okay, by now you're probably thinking, "Well the diameter of the pie must be small."  Oh snap!  You hit me with the geometry.  I don't know the diameter of their pies, okay, because by the time I think about the measurements of the slice (just to gauge how much I've actually eaten) it's already in my stomach.    Let's just agree that it's a big slice.  Prices are decent for the amount you get, and they taste like homemade goodness.

Fuddruckers used to serve a decent buffalo burger.  Then one day they changed to lower quality meat.  Not sure when it happened, but I bit into a burger filled with that public school luncheon type meat.  Maybe they gave me the wrong patty, I dunno. My stomach hurt afterwards and I haven't been back to Fudd since then.

A while back, I read reviews of this place while searching online for Moroccan food.  Have eaten here twice since then.    The overall business is quite spacious.  It encompasses a boutique, grocery store, and small dining area.  The owner says that she will be expanding and upgrading, but not sure of a time frame.    I'm mostly interested in the food, so as long as she keeps cooking up made-to-order platters, I'll keep visiting.  The food is yum yum yum to my tum tum tum.  I can barely pronounce the dishes and I surely can't spell them, but you can find  poultry, red meat, fish, and vegetarian food on the small menu.  There are pictures at http://phxfoodnerds.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1029&start=20  -  salad: wonderfully green, doesn't come with cheese (I detest cheese in my salads!), and is dressed in a light tasty vinaigrette. Morsels of toasted pita on top. - spinach pie: looks and tastes homemade (I'll order two next time.) - baba ghannouj: hearty, the eggplant is blended well and it's not bitter like some other places. -  kashkbademjan: warm version of baba ghannouj that's topped with olive oil, spices, and crumbles of nuts.  I could eat this alone as my meal - fish tangine: delicious with or without the marinated lemons. (The owner had run out of lemons on the second visit here.)  It arrives to your table sizzling hot.  It looks like a stew at first but once you cut into the fish and scoop up the veggies you can see that's it's a nice chunky sauce.  A bit oily but tasty.  With all the appetizers and salad, you can split the tagine easily between 3.  Just a note - If you're planning on going to Alzohour with more than 3 or 4 people, I highly recommend calling ahead.  Let me repeat.  If you are going in a group of more than 4, I highly recommend calling ahead because otherwise you might be in for a long wait to get dishes on the table.

OMG, am I really about to admit to liking one of the FRC restaurants?  Yes, I am going to say it:  I like Sauce.  I ate the kale salad (minus the farro crap) during my first visit and enjoyed the meal so much that I ordered another salad to go.  Recently, I ate Sauce for a second time and ordered a pizza and salad.  More on the pizza later; let us speak salad.  Roasted veggie salad.  Umm hmmm.  Ingredients were fresh and the veggies were not overly roasted.  The combination of cauliflower, squash, brussel(s) - is there an "s" on the end? - sprouts, cranberries, and candied walnuts are flavorful.  Not over the top...but, yet, however, actually I would have preferred plain walnuts instead.  Don't you be sugar-coating my nuts!       Now then, the pizza.  Wild mushroom with arugula, parm cheese, and truffle oil atop something they call pizza crust.  Not.  Maybe it was my bad for ordering the thin crust, but every bite I was reminded of unsalted saltine crackers.  Also, the veggies were not spread out too well on the pizza, because there were some slices with more than a two inch crust.  And that ain't right!  To add insult to my injury, I'm pretty sure they hoodwinked me out of the truffle oil.  Don't know what truffle oil tastes like, but absolutely nothing truffle-ly was going on about that pizza.  That being said, it tasted okay.  Not hugely disappointed, but not madly raving about it either.

I was passing by 7th Street and Glendale with an itch on my tongue for something  sweet.  Should I run into Safeway and deal with the multitude of aisles and lin--  hey there's Sauce!  I've yet to try their desserts.  It was already late and only a few tables were occupied.  More importantly there was no line at the register.  Score!  Let me just pop in there and grab a cookie.    During a prior visit, an amigo of mine told me the cookies were good.  It looked good in his hand, too!  So on this particular night when the cashier informed me that a batch of their triple chocolate chip cookies had just gone into the oven, I decided to wait the 20 minutes or so that it would take for them to finish baking.    And how yummy would it be to have one freshly out of the oven?  Right?  Right?  Am I right?  Ooh, I could hardly wait.  Fast forward...to my utter disappointment.  What the heck happened?  You call that a cookie?  I think (maybe) someone got the recipe wrong.  For the customers' sake, I'm hoping it was a simple recipe mistake.    I don't cook, so I understand how difficult all the mathematics of a recipe can be. A tablespoon here, a teaspoon there, here a half cup, there a quarter cup, everywhere a whole cup.  Maybe whoever made the dough that evening put too much or not enough of something.  The dough was so oily it could not even hold itself together.   And I don't think they use butter.  Butter doesn't feel like that.  This was, this was...sad.  Just sad.  I didn't even put it into my mouth.  The oily residue on my fingers probably would have worked wonders rubbed into my dry wintered skin, but inside my gut.  No thanks.

Good Afternooooon, Vietnam!  Did somebody say lunch time?  Somewhere I heard someone say something about some food.  What a pleasant surprise this Little Saigon is. Nice openness - little rooms with big tables. The atmosphere was comfortable with a capital C - from seating, ordering, eating, to asking questions about the menu. I even felt comfortable being the typical annoying customer.   Our servers were very kind and pleasantly accommodating. They informed the vegetarians in our party of chicken stock in the soup broth. Did we care?   -- begin moment of silence -- ...thinking of the chickens who gave their lives. Uhhhh...a little animal flesh and blood never hurt nobody.   -- end moment of silence --  Soup! Soup! Soup! Soup!  Food was tasty and plentiful. We ordered a multitude of items like three appetizers, boba, fried rice, tofu, veggies, spinach and onions, and a curry dish. Here were my personal choices:  1. Deep fried vegetarian egg rolls ($6) - six small crispy rolls accompanied by romaine leaves, parsley, mint, slices of cucumber and carrot. The rolls have tofu inside. I found one cube of it in each roll that was easily picked out with chop sticks.  2. Lotus root salad ($7) - sans pork. Tasty marinated lotus root and veggies served with four crunchy shrimp flavored rice chips on the side. Lotus is easily identifiable by sight, but its taste blended with the other veggies. The texture of it though is also unique. It reminded me of bamboo slices that get served in chow mein.  3. Bok choy soup w/ginger and onions ($8) - served in large bowl. Very good broth, close to a quart with dark green bok choy and few pieces of ginger and onion. The veggies alone would not be filling, but if you drink all the broth, you'd be full for the next hour or so.  4. Eggplant with onions and veggies ($8) - ordered spicy. It was good, but was not as spicy as I hoped. Took home leftovers.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to any vegetarian looking to try Vietnamese food.

So a vegetarian, pescatarian, and carnivore walk into a bar...  Well, we did walk into Wildfish Seafood Grille, but sat outside and ordered from the dinner menu. Service was impeccable, water and drinks were refilled promptly.   Pre-meal vittles were a half loaf of unimpressive artisan bread and seasoned butter. It's tasty when you're hungry, but I would think with those restaurant prices they should serve a variety basket of artisan and classy breads.  Here are the entrees we ordered:   Filet mignon (8 oz) topped with foie gras and truffled sauce - $54 Carnivores don't play with their meat. This plate was wiped clean.  Broiled swordfish steak topped with lump crab and garnished with avocado slices, cilantro, and red chile - $33 This was a decent size steak. There is no way I could have finished it, but our little  pescatarian wiped the plate clean.  Originally, I wanted to order the fresh market vegetables platter ($20) which is described as an entree of six different vegetable preparations. When I inquired what they were, I didn't hear six distinct veggies, so I think there may be different preparations of a couple of the same vegetables. I didn't bother to go into further detail with the waiter because I had already envisioned a bunch of cheese topped vegetables sauteed in oil.   So, I asked for the wild mushroom salad which comes with warm goat cheese, arugula, and champagne vinaigrette - $13. I ordered it sans cheese and thought fresh greens would be served. Unfortunately the greens were warmed up too which means that there could have been some wilted greens hidden among the bunch. Next time I will ask for cold arugula. Mushrooms were good and I definitely liked the combined flavor. Dressing was not at all overbearing.  Small sides:  fries - $7  cut thin and served with nuggets of parmesan and chives  broccolini - $7 flavored with lemon, garlic, and  pepper flakes. The pepper flakes are not listed on the menu but I like spiciness so I was happy with that kick from the green florets. They were served with their stalks and cooked to the right crunchiness.  spinach - $7 sauteed with garlic and parmesan  macaroni and cheese ($8) served very cheesy and with some truffle topping  Dessert: bananas foster cake ($9) This is the kind of sweet I have dreams about. Funny enough, I don't usually go for soggy desserts, but after the cake had been flambéed, the edges were pleasantly toasted and crunchy. The crunch combined with the moist center was a perfect match and then eaten with the fresh bananas and chunky pecan ice cream...aaaaahhhhh!   Four out of five stars for Wildfish. I definitely recommend it. But, before you head out for dinner I suggest getting acquainted with the online menu. It looks exactly the same as the one in the restaurant. Certain times of the week, pricing at Wildfish may be out of reach. After payday, it's a-okay.

IMHO the meals at Pappadeaux look better than they actually taste.  The flavors were either underwhelming or over salted.  But, they have a great staff that aims to please and is very good about providing substitutions for anything on their extensive menu.    What I found amazing were the desserts.  And as picky az I'm iz, it's hard to find amazing restaurant food.  Anyway, this review is strictly for the dessert.  Very yummy!  If I could eat sweets all day, I would order all desserts and feast like a Roman.    The usual suspects:  vanilla cheesecake, praline cheesecake, chocolate cake, bread pudding, creme brule, banana pudding, key lime pie, pecan/sweet potato pie.  Some were topped a la mode, some with yummy creme, berries, thin vanilla wafer, and came with sauces.  (I don't care for sweet sauces with desserts.  That's just overkill.  For goodness sake, aren't we obese enough?)  Who(m)ever is doin' the desserts is mmm oohhh mmm yeah  doin' it and doin' it and doin' it WOW  doin' it and doin' it and doin' it WOW   The portions are large so unless you're a glutton like me, you'll need to share.  Move over salmon!  These are the ones that I made room for:  1.  Banana pudding comes in a mason jar that's your keepsake.  Make sure you get a lid, too.  Topped with a tall serving of whipped cream, side strawberry, and a thin vanilla wafer.  I hadn't eaten whipped cream in such a long time, I ate it fast but it took a good five minutes before actually getting to the pudding.  Not a pudding fan, but it looked so pretty, I had to try it.    2.  Slices of cheesecakes looked about 4" in height and the top is browned so you can tell that they've been baked, deliciously, and then topped with whipped cream and berries.  One came with strawberry sauce, the other with caramel sauce.  The cheese sat on thick graham [Of Course!] crust.  It was hard to stop eating - ur, tasting - these.    3.  Slice of key lime pie was...key lime pie.  Decent sweet / tartness and a good thick crust.  Holds its own, but I'm not an avid eater of key lime.  4.  Slice of pecan/sweet potato pie came a la mode, quite sweet, and came with bourbon sauce.  The top is packed with pecan halves layered over the sweet potato.  Unfortunately the syrup from the pie, over powers the potato layer (which I could not even taste) and seeps into the crust.  I love pecans.  I love sweet potato.  But I gots no love for syrup.  It sort of ruined the pie.  Did I eat it though?  Sho' nough!

Cute stand alone on 19th Ave just above Osborn.  I've never seen the place full, but it's open for lunch and dinner and they have a catering delivery van in the parking lot.   Inside looks bigger than you'd expect with another dining area behind the wall and also doors leading to a patio.  Homey pictures and article cut-outs on the walls, and each table has a nice roll of thick paper towels.  You'll need 'em!    It's Creole style BBQ they say, but it's also a typical BBQ food joint that serves much meat with a whole lot of overcooked and fried sides.  No fresh veggies or green salad to speak of.    Okay, that the place.  Here's my review -   Begin: I tried the ribs.  Twice. The meat does not fall off the bones.   Bad, bad ribs. End review.

Lee Lee market is amazing.  Let me tell you how amazing.  The dictionary says that "Oriental" means "from or connected with eastern Asia."  But when you walk through Lee Lee, it's like walking though a multinational grocery store.  They carry grocery items for Mexican food, spices for African food, Indian groceries and hair care products, Mediterranean, Chinese, Japanese.  It's endless.  They also carry cleaning products and huge pots and pans.  There are particular things that I only get here, the same few things every visit.  But wouldn't you know, I always find myself walking around the entire store anyway.  From the produce to the frozen food section.  And here's a tip I've learned.  Sometimes the fruit is ugly.  It's not shiny and waxed like the fruit at the big chain grocers.  Don't let that fool you.  The ugly fruit is oftentimes the tastiest in the crop.

There's only one reason why I consider making a trip to Maizie's.  The jalapeno ranch dressing.  5 up for the jalapeno ranch.  It's aMAIZIEng!  Your tastebuds will not be disappointed.  I dip everything in it.    Sandwiches with jalapeno ranch. Sweet potato fries with jalapeno ranch. Salad with jalapeno ranch. Fish with jalapeno ranch. Fruit with jalapeno ranch. Dessert with jalapeno ranch (just kidding).  I usually stick to the same few dishes (with a few substitutions here and there) and the staff is very kind and accommodating.  They serve meat, but have veggie choices - plural - unlike other restaurants that only have one veggie choice.  Sit inside or out.  I choose out because it's less crowded and not annoyed by the tellies.  But they do allow pets so keep that in mind if you don't like eating next to animals.

I've never been to the Ladybug House brick and mortar, but from the posted pictures it looks like a cute spot.  This review is for their delivery service.    Someone at work handed me their take out menu one day and said that the sandwiches were decent.  I noticed prices were not too bad and there was no delivery charge.  Ordered the tuna sandwich - no mayo.  As I was told on the phone while ordering, they have only one delivery car so the wait may be a bit long, but actually it didn't seem that long at all.  Food arrived before "lunch hour" and I gave a nice TIP.  Delivery woman gave me a club card to receive a free sandwich after ordering so many.  I can't remember the exact number but most likely 10.  Sandwich was tasty.  The second time I ordered from Ladybug, I forgot to say no mayo.  Damn! Damn! Damn!  An ample amount of the shiny white stuff was between my sandwich and I was not happy.  Lesson learned, be sure to say NO MAYO when you order over the phone.

Heeeey, Z, Baaaaby, you know I didn't mean those things I said before.  I was exaggerating.  You know how I exaggerate.  What had happened was...  ...I wasn't feeling too good that day and took my foodie frustration out on you.  Baby, your service is on point.  That arugula salad was crisp and delicious with the candy coated walnuts.    The caaaandy cooooated waaaalnuts.  Caaaandy cooooated waaaalnuts.  I think you gave me extra didn't you?   Ummm hummmm.  And the pizza was just how I like it.  You knoooow how I like my pie don't you?   Don't you?  Don't youuuuu?  Puleeez take me back.   Z, I love you.

Ah yes, it was time to go home and that ever pending question "what's for dinner?" nagged at me.  I had just passed one Thai restaurant on Shea Blvd and thought of turning around to go back, but then I spotted Takeda Thai through the parking lot.  It was amongst some businesses which were not restaurants so at quick glance, I thought it might be a massage parlour or spa.   Anyway, my stomach must have subconsciously known the deal, because I continued straight in that direction and upon entering rejoiced - it was in fact a  restaurant.  Two seconds later I was kindly greeted by a gentleman who led me to the bar to order take-out.  He let me know that everything is made-to-order and any dish I wanted could be prepared vegetarian.  Super cool!   He also let me know the spice scale.  All the curries sounded delicious and I finally opted for the eggplant curry.  Good choice.  My weakness for spring rolls got the better of me at the sight of the word "crispy" on the menu and I asked for those veggie as well.  Excellent choice.  They. Were.  C R I S P Y.  And fried in an oil that wasn't heavy.  So were they gobbled up before I got home?  Naturally.  The eggplant was very delicious too.  It's mild flavor had a hint of spiciness which was perfect.  Mild should not mean "flat."  Garlic and basil were prevalent as well.  If I could change anything, I would ask for a larger serving.

Originally, I wasn't going to post a review for Seasons 52 because there are so many already, but the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to throw in my two cents.  If you like foods prepared with heavy oils and fats layered atop other fats, then  this restaurant isn't for you.  On the other hand, if  you want a meal that is clean and tasty, I highly recommend eating here.    With its pretentious upscale setting at the Biltmore mall, S52 gets away with serving small dishes - but for the genuine healthful and tastiness of everything - you can manage to put down appetizer, salads, entree, and desserts without feeling over stuffed.    Yes, the pricing is a bit much (imagine the overhead costs) and although $3.00 for a shot of dessert is creatively outrageous, the good feeling after eating their grub is priceless.    Here's what I enjoyed:    Appetizers - the muesli of apple slaw, cranberries, and pumpkin seeds that accompanied the glazed grilled chicken skewers was quite tasty and unexpected - shrimp scampi bruschetta with plum tomatoes, parsley, and garlic tasted like food that was simmered in its own juices.  Wow, I wish I could order a bowl of that.   - roasted mushroom with spinach stuffing and parmesan were okay.  Presentation was better than the taste though.  Salads - mushroom and arugula salad was very fresh and most of the flavor came from the parmasan cheese rather than the dressing. My preference would be raw mushrooms to the warm cooked ones.   - baby spinach & caramelized pear salad with walnuts (ordered sans cheese) was a refreshing mix of flavors.  The pear was sweet and crunchy and walnuts added the bit of fatty texture that tastes so good in salads   Entrees - grilled rainbow trout was good with the dill sauce.  Not greasy at all. - sesame grilled salmon was tender and lightly flavored even without the citrus sauce it came with.  Salad was fresh and I'm glad the dish was served with no starch on the plate. (aside from the shreds of jicama)  Dessert shots - carrot cake was wonderfully moist and I will order this every time - canoli surprised my taste buds - pecan pie was sweet, but not sickly sweet and syrup-y like other pecan pies - blueberry / lemon creme was made with fresh plump blueberries that brought life to the dessert  I would definitely eat here again.  Once a season is my goal.

I like Thirteen North.  Convenient location, good atmosphere, friendly bar, outside seating.  In the words of Tracy Chapman: Give me one reason to stay here, oooh I'll turn right back around.  Reason:  Veggie wrap and sweet potato fries  Tracy:  I told you that I love you, and there ain't no more to say.   True love F O R E V E R.

Everyone is ignorant about something, right?    But how ig'nant can you be to think that Ethiopians don't have restaurants because people are starving in Ethiopia?  This is a comment that was said to me (yes someone I know actually said this) and it still get's me frazzled.  People starve here too.  In fact, folks in this country are starving more, because so much of what we shove into our mouths isn't food.  It's fuel...but not food.  Anyway, let me unbunch my panties and give this review.  Ethiopian Famous Restaurant and Coffee on E McDowell is unexpectedly located in a petite corner mall at 41 Street and McDowell.  Thankfully there is a large sign out front so I didn't miss it.  This was my third visit to an Ethiopian restaurant. I prefer eating food that looks whole, but for some reason I really get down with the how-many-dollops-of-food-can-we-fit-atop-this-injera-round that Ehiopian cuisine is known for.  (Oh no, I just ended a sentence with a preposition.)  I showed up at the crack of lunchtime to grab some grub on a combination platter.  Unfortunately they were out of a lot of ingredients, so I resorted to what the cook could feed me.  Ye-misir wot (red lentils), kik alicha (yellow peas), gomen (collard greens), tikle gomen (cabbage and carrot) without the carrot, and a couple of other veggie things - can't remember the names.  Flavor and jalapenos were prevalent and tickled my tongue but I couldn't stop eating.    Food was good. It went in good and came out even better the next day. Ahhhh.  What more can I say?

My disappointing spicy eggplant meal at Thai'd Up led me to try My Mom's Thai Kitchen.  My Mom's also offers an eggplant dish which I ordered for lunch take out.    Extra eggplant, broccoli, basil please.  They were out of spring rolls which was a disappointment, but I lived.  My bill was discounted and the meal cost only $10.    Was it worth it?  Oh yeah.  There were plentiful chunks of eggplant, very flavorful without a lot of grease.  Good portion.  I will be back.

After my favorite eatery in the neighborhood closed in 2015 I was avoiding the vicinity. But I finally returned to dine on Central and Camelback. Someone told me to stop being a pouty brat. (I can't use the exact words that were said to me because this is a family website.)  Service at Federal Pizza is a cut above all pizza joints. They treat customers like they're dining at a classy establishment. We got our glasses repeatedly refilled, dirty dishes promptly cleared away, and all the staff were aware of our table.  The F&A veggie board was good (I would def order again), the salad was good (would def reorder) and the polenta was good (would reorder). The romesco sauce was fantastic. Where has it been all my life? The pizza was so-so.  From the pictures on Yelp, I was hesitant to try the pizza because I didn't think I would like the crust. But crust tasted okay and the pizza was saucy. The downside: the crust is weak and requires some attention getting it off the tray without spilling off the toppings, there was very little cheese, the toppings were overly sweet.   So most likely I will probably not reorder pizza. But I was happy with the veggie selections and FP is a good place to be.

Originally, I was going to say that I hope meals at Krispy Creations are better than their desserts, but after reading the reviews it seems like they need a new cook and a new baker.  Myself, I am not a fan of cooking or baking so I rarely do either.  I would rather spend my time doing any number of other things than to be in the kitchen.  But I know that I can't cook.  So you will not find me selling anything that I do manage to whip up.  Anyway, when I asked the friendly young man behind the counter what the treats in the display were, he had to guess.  (It irks me so much when labels are not provided for the customer and on top of that the employee is clueless as to what baked goods s/he is actually selling.)  But it's not his fault training was not provided to him.  So I asked for what looked like a peanut butter cookie, a peanut butter reeses cup cookie, and a plain mini cheesecake.  If I could insult the baker - once again - by giving no stars, I would.  But I give one star for effort.  Bravo for trying to cook.  The cookies were refrigerator cold so that was an automatic NOrgasm.  Also there was no cookie in the cookies.  They were blobs of peanut butter chips.  I broke them in half to see the insides and both of them had a look of rawness - probably from all the fat in the peanut butter chips.    And...um...the...um...the ? cheesecake?  What an anti-climax!  Some folks might like light and airy cheesecake with a hint of crumbly graham on the bottom.  Not me.  I don't want cheesecake to give me wings.  I want cheesecake to smack me down and hold me there.  And when I pick up cheesecake, that graham crust better pull its weight because I want to bite into it like I'm eating a sandwich.  Yes, I can have my cake and eat it too.  But I couldn't jump on these yucky treats from Krispy Creations.  They made my penis soft.  Not going there again or even suggest anyone go near.

Am I really seeing five star raves from other reviewers?  Well either I ate at the Submarinos in a parallel universe or I just ordered the wrong item, because nothing about my veggie pizza was deserving of five stars.  I'm only giving two stars because the folks were accommodating, kind, and offer delivery.  The menu says veggie pizza comes with olives, onions, mushrooms, and green peppers, but we paid extra for three more toppings.  This pie should be pretty tasty, right?  Before I get to that, let me regress a little...Have you seen those 1980's Wendy's commercials "Where's the beef?"  Well picture the vegetarian version "where's the veggies?"  Because THAT was my first reaction when I saw the pizza pie.    The veggies were chopped so small - How small were they?  They were so small that I could have snorted all the toppings and still not have gotten the recommended nutritional daily allowance.  They were so small that I mistook them for the sprinkles that you put on cupcakes.  They were so small that I thought maybe I was going senile and actually ordered a cheese pizza.  There were so small - No, seriously, they were small.  And covered in a thick blanket of cheese.  But that's not the worse part.  As I ate the first slice, with each bite I was like...hmmmm...there's something about this pizza.  What's the word I'm looking for?  It's on the tip of my tongue.  Oh, what's that word?  This is what I was thinking the whole time.  Then I finished the slice and it came to me.  Bland.  The pizza was bland.

Any place that serves a real vegetable burger deserves a visit.  Don't cha think?  So I tried the meatless magic mushroom burger (10.95).  How do you say "greasy?"  Every layer of it was greasy.  From the mayo on the bread that looked like somebody jizzed on my food to the mushrooms, the onions, the tomatoes, the capers, the spinach - all greasy.    The side of yam (sweet potato) waffle fries wasn't greasy, by the way.  They were dry and rather annoying.  How does that work?  The one thing on the plate that I expected to be greasy was totally dry.  Ruby red trout fish and chips (14.95).  Sounds good.  But how does it taste?  Taste?  Ha!  Let me tell you how it looked, because first impressions are very important.  Three small pompously breaded strips of fish sitting on a bed of fried potato cardboard strips.    Need I say more?  Spoke & Wheel goes down in my book as Joke & Steal.  Two stars for the staff who was polite  But my order, naw man, was total shite.

This is my goto place when I want a raw / vegan meal for lunch.  It's in a great spot on Grand Ave and has tons of natural lighting.  The staff is friendly and as awesome as they come.    The veggie meals are simple and priced just right.  A big plus is that they offer  vegan options without tofu.  I'm not a fan of soy!  And if you like treats, you won't be underwhelmed.  Assortments of goodies such as pie, cookies, cake, scones are always encased in the glass display conspicuously placed in the eating area.  Purposely I'm sure so you won't leave before ordering one.

I go to this 20th St location for the juice bar - $7.00 for a 16 oz juice.  High 5 for the juice bar.  They've got those extractors spewing out fruit and veggie essence from opening at 7:00 AM through to the night.  Pick your own or have them concoct some veggie medicine for you.    Also, occasionally I'll dip into the hot food bar like when they offer jackfruit, meatloaf, kale salad, baked squash, or any other tasty dish that doesn't push canola oil.  Funny how I used to burn $$ at WF once a week when I lived eastward and would lug stuffed bags of goodies home habitually.  Now I hardly shop there because I get so much at Sprouts or other grocery chains in quality locations.

I hate the Vig and their d@mn yam fries with curry dip!  Sweet potato fries, whatever - let me finish!  I get curried away every time I'm in Vig territory.  I yam pining for fries everyday now.  Get this monkey off my back!  Doc, I need help.

Why, oh why does this always happen to me?:  I find food that I really like - then...the restaurant changes the recipe.  For worse.  Went back for a re-up of yam fries twice now and they were completely destroyed.  Tasted like cardboard.  Vig cooks are coating the yams with some fry stuff that makes the fries hard and way overcooked.  I'm not happy at all.  Pas du tout!  On top of that the curry sauce tasted sweetened.  Yuck!  Will not be ordering yam fries again.   Damn you, Vig!  Damn you!   Fish tacos are a'ight, so maybe I'll go back for those.  No time soon though.

Love the decor.  Love the staff and I really wanted to support this business, but my pies were not ready the next day like they should have been so I ended up with a rush order of pies with the filling just sitting in the shells.  Despite that, the peanut butter cream pie is surprisingly tasty.  Maybe in the far future I will order again to see if there has been any improvement.   Two flavors I wasn't fond of:  the cheesecake (it didn't scream CHEESECAKE) or the apple pie (my preference is thin crust, but M. Anita's top and bottom crust was very thick).

The thought of having gin(ger) and juice on a hot afternoon was comforting so I dashed into 24 Carrots Juice Bar & Cafe thinking that it would serve fresh juice. It does...sort of.  Sadly the flavor of juice I wanted, is not freshly made to order - whaaa? - it was previously extracted earlier in the day. Uh, no thanks, I'll pass on the juice that's been sitting around all day.   Scoped out the pastries and asked about ingredients. Everything that looked appetizing to me was gluten-free. Um, no thanks, I'll pass. If I'm going to eat flour, then I want the dose of gluten that naturally comes with.  Wow, I actually felt awkward. Was I really going to leave empty handed? I turned to the door, I turned to the counter, I turned to the door again. I looked back at the cashier looking back at me to see me looking back at him to decide what I was going to do.   What happened next I know not, but I believe a jedi mind trick was afoot because I was leaving with a big to go bag in hand.  1. Raw jalapeno poppers ($6) - pieces of bell pepper stuffed with spicy almond "cheese" and dried cranberries atop field greens. Very tasty. The beginning of this meal was looking quite promising. I think there were four poppers but unfortunately the almond spread wasn't thick enough to stay in the pepper. As I bit, it dribbled all over my shirt and crotch. Mmmm spicy cheese crotch! Eating on the run is a messy business.  2. Zucchini Noodle salad ($9) - spiralized zucchini, veggies, and seed medley atop field greens with choice of tahini or balsamic dressing. Well that zucchini wasn't the only thing spiraling because here's where the meal started to spiral downwards. I didn't see anything resembling a seed medley, and my request for tahini dressing went to no avail. Whatever I got tasted like vinaigrette. Not like. Not happy. So I was left with a beautiful salad of hard veggies that I was no longer interested in eating.   3. Raw Tacos ($12.75) - cabbage cups, walnut meat, avocado, salsa, veggies, cashew cream, and comes with a side. I wasn't given cabbage cups, I was given a couple of flat dehydrated rounds that were used as soft taco shells. They tasted like beans. If you like beans, this will probably be your thing. I DID NOT like it. Also, the walnut meat was a fail for me. From how it tasted, the nuts had been soaked and then mixed with something (not sure what). I would have rather been given plain raw walnuts. And to add insult to injury the avocado slice was badly bruised. The cook should have thrown it out! Not happy with that melange.   4. Bountiful burger ($13) - butternut burger, spiced cranberry chutney, kale slaw, choice of bun or bed of greens, and comes with a side. I was really looking forward to this butternut. I assumed it was butternut squash. Well you know what they say happens when you assume. I have no idea what part of the patty was butternut because all I could taste were beans. Again, if you like beans....this is your dish. The flavor was there, but the beans were a no go for me.   So what started out promising turned into a depressing ending to a meal that could have been wonderful if only I was given the ingredients that I ass u me'd would have been available.

First time eating Peruvian food so I had no idea what to expect. I read through the small vegetarian section on the menu and took a long shot anyway. Potato and veggies. How bad could it be?    Well, I would have rather eaten somewhere else. The best thing about the meal was the drink of lucuma juice. It was delicious. Everything else, not worth waiting for. And that was everyone's sentiment.  For the meat eaters, any dish with flavor was just salty. For the vegetarians, the food was not flavorful at all. In fact it was outright bland. Even the sauces were bland! That's hard to swallow, especially when the meal consists of all starchy foods. (potatoes, corn, peas, rice)  For the meat eaters plates included: appetizers of Causa Rellena (two tier potato cake with chicken filling), Papa Rellena (fried potato dough stuffed with meat), Papa a la huancaina (boiled sliced potatoes covered with sauce and egg) and then chicken entrees.   For the vegetarians plates included: appetizer of Yucca Frita (fried yucca with dipping sauce), entree of veggie Causa Rellena (two tier potato cake with creamy vegetable filling), and sides of Sarsa de Cebolla (onions marinated in lime juice) and Camote Frito (thin strips of salty fried sweet potato). The onions saved the meal. Without them, there would have been no other flavor.  I will try Peruvian food again, but not at El Chullo.

I have no idea how this establishment is holding a high rating. Maybe the goods baked for custom orders are much better than the items they sell in the display.   The first time I made a purchase from Karl's I was disappointed with the mini muffins I bought. I gave the bakery a second try and purchased three other items - something lemony, something carroty, something almond marzipan.   Nothing tasted like bakery goods.   They need to remove the "Quality" from their name. It's not deserving.

Lo and behold, all this time I've been spelling Caribbean wrong.  No wonder I can never find it!  It's 1 R and 2 B's.  1 R and 2 B's.  1 R and 2 B's.  Okay -   If you find yourself straying westward one afternoon, stop for lunch at the Caribbean Marketplace on 44th Av & W Northern.  The restaurant is expanding to include more dining space.  I am rooting for it's success.  With expansion, I'm hoping to see more organization and a better use of the displays.   Overall friendly atmosphere; nice ambiance in the restaurant with music to keep rhythm to.  I'm fond of the tall wood tables and chairs.  They add class to the cheap looking tile floor.  The grill outside was hot, but empty so I presume they only grill upon order.   The grocery store is small with a few packed aisles.  I saw a bit of everything.  If you need something - ask.  Numerous folks came through to pick up one or two things or just out of curiosity, so this spot is pulling in a good crowd.   Meanwhile, back in the restaurant, I was happy to have a tall serving of homemade sorrel.  Oh yes, yes, that takes me back....Prepared to wait for the snapper (made to order) I also enjoyed a veggie patty of corn, carrots, and cabbage.  It was the classic veggie patty that I remembered from my other life.    What I wasn't happy about was the lack of green vegetation on the menu.  Oxtails, chicken, goat, patties (beef, chicken, veggie), coco bread, plantains (way too oily!), rices & peas, pasta salad, and potato salad were readily available.  Where were the greens, callaloo, okra?  Nonetheless, my order of snapper was beautifully prepared with bell peppers and onions.  Yummy.  The cook allowed the veggies to flavor the dish and did not rely on a heavy hand of salt.  I will def come to the Caribbean (1 R, 2 B's) Marketplace again and I do recommend that you stop by too.    Call ahead 623-930-5258 to see what else the cook can prepare.

So what's better than dessert, you ask?   A dessert to eat after dessert.  Sho 'nuf!  Post dinner at Biltmore Fashion Centre we instinctively walked towards Frost.  The smell of free samples was in the air.  Their website lists a long menu of gelatos and sorbets, but the store displayed 38.  My guess is that flavors get rotated every once in a while.  There's a good mix of fruity flavors, caramel flavors, nut flavors, cheesecake, and chocolates of which you get unlimited sampling.  Unlimited?  That's what our server said.  I think there were some "diabetic" options too.  Already running on a full tank at the time, I failed to take advantage of the sampling.  Damn stomach, grow bigger!  3 particular flavors that pack a punch:  salted caramel, peanut butter crunch, and pistachio.  Amazingly tasty but light on the tongue.    Sadly, the taste doesn't come through in all of the gelatos and in my opinion the frost bite was pointless.    And cost?  Ain't cheap.  Your pick from three cup sizes or a waffle cone which costs 6 bits extra.  But for a nice treat, I will definitely go back again and lick more flavors.

Stopped in this place to see what's new.  I'm not a burger fan, but wanted to see what else the menu offered.  Burgers and more burgers.  There is a grain/bean burger for those who want a meatless choice.  That's the only veggie choice, in fact.  I passed on the burger, though, and ordered sweet potato fries.  I have since been back to order them again, so this review is for the sp fries.  Although they are cut thinner than I prefer, they are nicely crispy and stay crispy.  $4 for a decent amount and they're addictive.  The place is spacious and has 2-3 tellies to entertain.  The wood tables are nicely varnished and there is wonderful natural lighting pouring through all the windows.    Young staff is friendly and the manager (or owner) greets the guests.

Just recently used Delivery Dine this past weekend.  I was working from home and really didn't want to cook anything.  I thought to myself, "Self, wouldn't it be great if Phoenix restaurants provided delivery service like the restaurants in real cities?!"  Then I remembered the pamphlet which I picked up at Macayo's one fine afternoon while I was ordering some tacayos (oh sorry - tacos).  The pamphlet unfolded to three panels which listed restaurants in the valley that used Delivery Dine as their delivery service.  It's true, it's true!  I can sit at home on my fat ass and have food delivered to me.  I'll take it!  So in a nut shell this is what I did: 1. on the website, keyed in my ZIP code 2. selected the restaurant I wanted (I was in the mood for classy american grub, you know - sandwich and fries)  3. viewed the menu and clicked on the choices 4. customized my choices in the shopping cart 5. made notes for the delivery man in the special note field (I told him what floor I was on) 6. checked out  It was that easy.  5 bucks was added to my food tab.  Then a gratuity charge was added as well which is the same as if I was leaving a TIP.  And like I said, my fat ass wanted delivery so I took it.  I received two emails updating me when the driver arrived at the restaurant and when my food was on its way to my mouth.  It's a low tech version of the pizza site that gives you the status of your pizza order.  Original estimated waiting time for my order was one hour, but it actually arrived in half that time which is like that old pizza tag line "30 minutes or less."  So my fat face stuffed itself earlier than planned, albeit happily.  The driver was courteous and cool.  I will definitely use them again another day.

It took me a while to notice that GrabbaGreen was a separate restaurant from Chloe's but I finally woke up and slapped myself.    Fresh juice here?  Well slap me again!  GrabbaGreen knows how to juice a juice.  I had become a bit fed up with Bowl of Greens (which is down the street at ASU) so I'm happy to have another option.  It took me a while to get through the menu, but I was coached by the guy behind the counter and he made it worth the effort.    And if you like choices, this is choice heaven.    The salad options didn't impress me too much but you can definitely plan a decent meal.  Six-step process to salad recovery:  1. Select grains or greens 2. Select flesh or legumes 3. Select 5 nutrients from nuts, veggies, fruits, sprouts, beans, olives, yam, onions 4. Select cheese 5. Select herb 6. Select dressing.  (The pomegranate sauce is delicious.)   For breakfast or lunch, GrabbaGreen should be your goto for a quick raw food meal.

Very few restaurants cause me to drop dietary defenses, but I must admit Couscous Express had me forgetting about my food concerns. This little restaurant on E McDowell is good for lunch and an early din-din.  It lives up to the 'express' in its name. The owner didn't have us sitting for long with an empty spot on the table. We wanted to try everything, so more or less ordered the whole farm.  Meat, fish, poultry, herbs and veggies, grains, roots, legumes, fruit, dairy. It was like a continuous parade of platters were being marched to our table and the owner accommodated us with extra plates to serve the food.    All dishes are suitable for one person, but if you don't come with a big appetite two people can share a plate and still get full. I managed to finish ev'ry bite with no leftovers. Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!  The nitty-gritty on the dishes:   - Date shake. How do you say YUM? I could wake up and drink that stuff for breakfast. It was thick, peanut-y, and not too sweet. Bet I could work through the entire morning on one date shake. Protein shake? We don't need no stinkin' protein shakes. We gots date shakes, B-otch. - Tea was okay. Maybe if it was served after the meal and a hotter temperature I would have enjoyed it more.  - Hummus was deliciously flavourful. I could eat a tub of it. - Bread was a round of light fluffy flour that I prefer much more than pita.  - Couscous side was absolutely delicious by itself. Whatever seasoning he used to give that salty/cheesy flavor was a surprise to the taste buds. And the texture was perfect. I took some to go and ate it by itself in front of the telly. Instead of handfuls of buttered popcorn, I had my spoonfuls of cheesy steamed couscous. What?!  Don't think I'll ever ask for another pot of boiled couscous. Steamed only going forward. - Couscous salad. Mmmm-meh. Call me boring, but I prefer green salads. Gotta get greens. - Lamb couscous was tender and cooked just right. - Tangines were delicous.  Spiced right and flavourful, not at all oily - obviously simmered in their own juices.  - Bastilla. My first time having it. If I re-order, it would have to be as a main dish with lots of side veggies. I like the top sweet crunchy phyllo but could do without the powdered sugar.    Nitty-gritty on the decor:  Simple and tasteful. Decorated with hookahs, food stuffs, and Argan oil for sale. Changes have been made since the earlier reviews this year. To get an idea of the new layout, see the image that reviewer Franko L uploaded on May 11, 2015. There are about five small tables inside and one for a larger party. The center of the dining area is completely open so it has the appearance of plenty of space. Outside there are two large wooden tables.   Separate restrooms for fe/male is great for a such a small place but if you wish to avoid any claustrophobic winces and cramping I suggest you use the loo before getting to the restaurant and carry wet-naps to clean your hands before eating.  Nitty-gritty on the owner:  A genuine host. There were other customers dining as well and they were getting served just as fast as us. Obviously the owner knows what he's doing. Definitely in his element with this petite-sized venue. He encouraged paced dining, conversation, and pure enjoyment of the meal. No customers were rushed into ordering or paying.  Expectations:  I wish there were more vegetables in the meals rather than so many potatoes. The few veggies I had were overcooked.  After reading other yelp reviews and drooling over pictures of food, I was looking forward to having the carrots and olives appetizers. Oh well, next time.

So I was fixing to go shopping when I spied across the parking lot, a sign with the word "juice." As a firm believer that juice is good food, my conditioned response was to follow the sign just to see what it could be --  -- oh wait, here's Chompie's cake, cookies, pie  uhhh, snap out of it! --  I pulled myself away from Chompie's bakery section amazingly having resisted the temptation to buy a thick slice of cheesecake for $4.95. It turned out that the word "juice" belongs to Nekter Juice Bar where I spent that same $4.95 on a fresh 12 oz green juice.  The smell of freshly extracted fruits and veggies hit me when I first walked in and I stood there for some seconds with a stupid smile on my face. The cashier waited for me to come to my senses and place an order. After contemplating bitter or sweet, I went for sweet and chose apple as the base mixed with the greens.   Happy choice. There was so much chlorophyll in that drink, I must have been photosynthesizing for the rest of the day.  The space is rather small, and I could see the juicers in the back. They work hard for the nutrition. No way would I be able to stand there and do it all day. It's a real workout. Forget going to Orange Theory (which is a few doors down), just get a job being a juicer.  The bar also sells smoothies and acai bowls for those who want something a little heavier.

If there is any business that I would have wanted to replace My Mom's Thai Kitchen, it's this restaurant - Vegan House.  The decor is brand new and looks great.  Earthly colors all over.  These ain't yo mama's fast food gotta-eat-meat colors.  You can free your mind (and your ass will follow) while you sit and wait for food. You may just break out the aromatherapy and start a meditation chant while your Qi comes in equilibrium with the cosmos.  Currently the hours are everyday from 11 AM to 9 PM so I hope the downtown crowd makes use of their hospitality.  Lunch Specials are M-F 11PM-3PM.  They have togo menus too and deliver within a mile radius.  The extensive menu includes appetizers, soup, salads, tempura,  noodles, rice, sandwiches, wraps, and desserts.  And although most of the meals are typical, they are delicious vegan and vegetarian Thai / american.     Cooked up and served by a staff that cares about their clients' allergies.  "Was I allergic to soy or peanuts" they asked me.  When was the last time that happened at a restaurant?  And now for the food:  1. MC salad.  What a surprise!  Flavor exploded in my mouth.  It's mostly mango and carrot with sauteed onion and peanuts on top of romaine lettuce.  I think they used some carrot dressing too.  Sweet and tangy to taste.  Worth it!  2. Green Curry.  Creamy coconut milk with veggies.  Love it!  I could probably drink the coconut milk by itself.  3. Eggplant.  Delicious, but a little on the oily side.    All were flavorful.  Not salty  Thumbs up to Vegan House.  Vegan in da house!  Woop woop woop!

So finally 50 N Central Avenue has a new tenant, The Counter. Open daily.  The Counter offers sandwiches, salads, shake shake shakes, booze, and build-your-own-grilled cheese for $8, but the champions are the burgers.    Offering an incentive to have your burger and eat it too, they sell on average for $12-13, but if you build-your-own and indulge in extra fixin's, you'll be lighter $12-13 MINIMUM.  All the favorites from fast food/sandwich shoppes are combined onto one menu. From regular ingredients to premium choices, from natural to organic. Currently the offerings are 3 patty sizes; beef patties, tuna, turkey, or chicken; 20 flavors of cheese slices or spreads; over 25 types of relish, mustard, salsa, aioli, vinaigrette, or other dressings (option to purchase a flight of 3); 40 different toppings of veggies, pickled stuffs, chili, meats; 8 types of buns; and $3 sides consisting of various fries, salads, veggies, and chili.   Word to the wise, if you're an office folk who's only allotted a set number of minutes to eat at midday, download the 15 page menu from the website and give it a look-see in advance because after you've made your choices and go through the required 6-Step BYOB process you'll already need to head back to the office.  1. Choose Your Burger 2. Choose Your Cheese 3. Choose Your Sauce 4. Choose Your Toppings 5. Choose Your Bun 6. Choose Your Side  Still want to eat here?  I do!   Their sign clearly reads "The Counter Custom Built Burgers" and one day I want to be the idiot who goes ALL veggie on 'em. Veg Up, b!tches.   Unfortunately, it hasn't happen yet because on the afternoon that I went there was no take-out. Huhhh? I was told they were only fulfilling eat-in orders because things got too confusing and they couldn't handle both.  Okay, now I'm confused. They've opened a restaurant downtown, directly adjacent to the Jefferson / 1st Ave metro stop, it was lunch time, and they were not fulfilling take-out orders.  Wow.   Wow.  Uh, wow.  Okay, I'll try back later. Hope y'all are still in business...

Its take-out Tuesday again. What to eat? What to eat?  A quick consultation with Yelp and it's decided to visit The Coronado.   What a lovely place! Located less than a mile north of the artsy Roosevelt row and looks like one of those house-type cafes that I would like to live in.   Not many seats and a menu small enough to fit on a 5x8 card, but the important thing is that they serve jackfruit. Yes, honey. Jackfruit - a special treat for folk who like variety in their vegetarian staples.  3 jackfruit sliders puleeeze! They held the mayo for me and still the bitty sandwiches were moist. Purple cabbage was crisp. Bread was lightly dry-toasted and soft. Perfect amount of fries, fried with skin on and not overly salted.  Will come again. Sho'nuff!

How do I write this review without sounding so cliche? How do I avoid using those annoying phrases like "to die for" and "the best ever"? How can I say my words without an over use of exclamation points? (My grammar teacher will snap the ruler against my knuckles!)  Well if I can't say it, give me a canvas so I can paint a picture.  You know that feeling when you have a good thing going? You want to capture THAT exactly as it is and not have one iota change. Well... I want this restaurant to stay open always.  I want that chef to be there forever. I don't want the menu to change ever.  Folks at the table were humming with joy and shimmying to the middle eastern music coming from the wide screens.   I, myself, wanted to crawl into the basket of warm pita bread and hibernate there for the winter. And let me tell you neither a beggar nor borrower I be, but for this review I'm begging you to borrow some cash and support this wonderful restaurant, Rotana. It's Located on Greenway Parkway just past 7th Street and across the drive thru of Wells Fargo.   In all honesty, this is the best Mediterranean food I've eaten. It's to die for!  Whew.  There are multiple veggie options on the menu (full color and pictorial) and although most of them are listed as appetizers, you can easily make a meal out of two items and leave satiated. The dishes we ordered were simple but deliciously filled with an abundance of incredible flavor.   Everything tasted as if it had been made-to-order. I think there was a solo operation going on in the kitchen because our plates came out one at a time. But it's all for one and one for all at our table so even though sharing the first dish was obligatory, as other plates arrived and covered the table in goodness we were all happily chomping on our own dishes and finished eating around the same time.   Here's what the vegetarians ordered:  Hummus - $5.50 Yummy, creamy. Just fancied up with a topping of whole chickpeas, olive oil, and flavor.   Baba Ghanouj - $6.50 The menu says "smoked to perfection" and I wholeheartedly agree. The eggplant was perfectly smooth, tasty, topped with tomato garnish, olive oil, and flavor.  M'jadara - $5.00 Lentils with rice, topped with crispy onions and flavor. Normally I would not have liked this dish because the rice was mushy combined with the texture of the lentils, but it was delicious. I actually dug in and ate a few spoonfuls.  If you like beans and rice, order it.  Roasted brussels sprouts - $5.00 Tossed with cranberries. Not crunchy, yet firm. Yeh to firm green veggies. I was impressed with the melange.   Muhammara - $5.50 My first time hearing of this dish. It's a red pepper paste mixed with walnuts. The menu claimed "spicy red pepper" and although one person at the table tasted some heat, all I got was a mouthful of saltiness. Too salty for my taste, but I liked it paired with the m'jadara and brussels sprouts.   Fattoush rotana salad - $7.00 Wow. This salad was the most complicated looking dish on the table. Like a kaleidoscope - purple, orange, red, all shades of greens, there may have been yellow too. Piled with several ingredients and topped with fried pita, flavorful dressing, and some delicious seasoning that I've never tasted before.  I. Wanted. To. Lick. The. Salad.  Are you hearing me? Lick. It.  Falafel - $6.00 Thankfully the fritters were not oily, but unfortunately their texture was dry and uneventful. If there exists a falafel spectrum in the universe, it must only read "dry" on one end and "oily" on the opposite end with nothing in-between because I've only had falafel either dry or oily. Haven't found a restaurant yet that has found a balance. Skip it.  Vegetarian burger - $6.00 An overgrown falafel in burger clothes. Normally that would be okay, but this falafel was dry, so unless you like it like that, skip it.

Phoenix might be in the desert, but it is definitely an oasis for franchises. Smoothie King #1353 just opened on Central Ave and Thomas in a strip mall, situated betwixt bread/bakery and burgers/fries joints. Franchise or not, it'll have to work hard to stand out.   The staff was friendly and gave me some coupons for chocolate smoothies. Could there be such a thing? Ooh yeah! I also picked up a menu and the nutritional guide. Kudos to Smoothie King for having such extensive literature. The company is really aiming for customers who care about what they eat.   Open from 7AM-9PM Monday through Saturday with shorter hours on Sunday so seriously, you could plan your daily meals. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Just be wary of the sugar and request no turbinado.   Unfortunately, during my visit the sensory perception was not picking up any love. There was no sweet smell of fruit in the air. I miss that! What I saw were a lot of small packaged nutritional products for sale.  And, it was white everywhere. The whole place was white...like The Matrix construct. Yo! My residual self image was trying to make sense of it all. "Welcome to the desert of the real smoothie." I'm pretty sure Morpheus was there.  Then, in my head, I heard the operator say, "What do you need?"  "Smoothies," I said, "Lots of smoothies."
