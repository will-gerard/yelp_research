Great barbers they even give you a massage.  I think they should massage the head to stimulate the hair growth  for us guys that are going bald. Very nice guys.

I just cant make up my mind which place I like more Parlor or Cibo's? I love them both but for different reasons. I can walk to Cibos and that's a plus. Parlor doesn't have a long wait and they have a lot more seating inside with lots of room. Both have great energy and the atmosphere is unique and very pleasant.  The service is Friendly and the owners are always there to meet and greet you,  very sweet couple. The food is amazing I love the salads and most of the pizzas. Cibo's has that intimate atmosphere when the weather is nice out. I like waiting outside by the fire pit  when its cold listening to the live band.  I also like the wine selection and drinking wine at Cibo's more than parlor probably because of atmosphere. Its a perfect place to take a date so you should check it out. They both are very delicious. JT

I been to most of the breakfast places here in the downtown area and this is one of my favorites, not just because its in walking distance or that you can get a 10% off your bill if you ride your bike there either. That's just an added bonus. The real reason we go there as much as we do is because the food is absolutely amazing. The owners are always there to meet and greet you and let you sit where ever you want. I have actually tried everything on the menu at least once for sure.  However I must recommend one of my favorites and that is the "Fire Island Eggs" that dish is the bomb, yum yum. Check it out.  JT

We had dinner last night at the Parlor for the 3rd time its a great place. I just cant make up my mind which place I like more Parlor or Cibo's? I love them both but for different reasons. I can walk to Cibos and that's a plus. Parlor doesn't have a long wait and they have a lot more seating inside. Both have great energy and the atmosphere is unique and very pleasant. However, I think the pizza at parlor lets you have the option of making it your own way from the size to the different kinds of meats, cheeses, toppings and even some spices to choose from. The service was Friendly and knowledgeable. This review is meant for Parlor but I can't knock one over the other. I'm sure you can add and subtract from the dishes at Cibo's too. Parlor is newer and you should check it out. They both are very delicious. JT

Great place to eat, I love the jalapeno hummus and the chipolte chicken lavosh pizza. The atmosphere is alive, great energy and has a fresh new look with a friendly staff. I think this is the largest Pita Jungle that I have seen it's defiantly the nicest location. Lots of seating inside and out. Can't wait for the weather to get warmer so we can enjoy the patio area. The best part of having this great new place is that its only 1 block away from where I live, perfect walking distance.  The only thing I did not like about this place was that it closes way to early 10 pm and on First Friday it should stay open to at least 12 or 1am. Hope they adjust those hours soon, so Check it out.... =o)

Best tacos in Arizona and only for a buck. You can't beat that price. The nachos are amazing the burrito are made any way you like.

I have been going to Matt's big breakfast since it opened up in that little tiny building. I remember when we could walk in and pick where we wanted to eat but that didn't last very long before everyone had their own experience and word spread fast just how amazing the food is and service has always been very pleasant.  I'm so happy that the moved to the other corner of the block for the larger location. The food is worth the wait  it's just to bad everyone else has to agree. If you are smart and a regular you can time the wait and do something else until you think you will be called next.

Very rude would not serve a group of 20 poeple because the host did not want to move tables together and sit us.

The service is great I love what they did with the space it looks amazing. I will definitely be back soon. So glad to have the vig in my hood. The bartenders are awesome and the service is very professional. The food is good, I haven't had everything on the menu but almost. If there is something you don't like they fix it right away.  I come here at least 3 X a week if not more.  Hope to see you there next time.

The food was very good love the cornbeef and brisket I had the skyscraper sandwich and the sloppy T, which was my favorite. The price seemed a bit high but it was also delivery. I would defiantly check it out again, I'm curious to try the bread pudding.
