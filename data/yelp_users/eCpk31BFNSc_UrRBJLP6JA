First time here. They were friendly, gt me right in and did a great job. The tech that did my nail was Kristen and she took her time and gave me a great massage even tho I just asked for the basic cheapest mani and pedi.

Haven't been here in about a year. Was really disappointed since I drove here from chandler. Used to be good. This time it was not even close to being good.   Got the tonkatsu ramen. The noodles were super soggy and falling apart as I grabbed them with the chopsticks, the broth was extremely salty, and the pork was old. It had a funky taste to it. The only edible part was the extra tofu that I added.

Bun cuon is made fresh in house. Best I've had. The pho is pretty decent too. Not really busy on weekday but pretty packed on weekend. I've tried most of the items on the menu and everything has been good and consistent so far! And they're prices are pretty fair for the portions they offer.
