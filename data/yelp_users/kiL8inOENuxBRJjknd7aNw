We got married in the amphitheater and it was beautiful, intimate and perfect! Pictures turned out so pretty too, one of the prettiest places in AZ! It only cost 800 and we did the ceremony only. We had about 100 people there, they said it could seat 125 but I think it could seat a lot more as the crowd looked scarce at our wedding. They did a great job, ranging from arranging everything to the day of the wedding. I don't really have any complaints. Main thing is that if you are walking down the trails get ready to get your dress very dirty. I wish I would have bustled it or had a carpet down.

We just had dinner at your Arcadia restaurant last night and I had a panini and bruschetta. It was delicious but the chips were horrible. We used to look forward to your potato chips that came with the sandwich. They were thick, well seasoned, almost like freshly cut potatoes.  The new chips you added are worse than ruffles. At least get Tim's or something close. Posinos is a special, artisan  restaurant and can do much better. All of your food is well made. The chips take up half the plate and represent 1/4 the meal. The devil is in the details. These new, hard, unflavored chips are a disservice to customers and the meal. They detract and are a waste of space, they may be cheaper but we noticed and were disappointed. Bring the old chips back.

I planned my reception myself and used A-Z for a big part of my site- ranging from the chairs to the generator to glasses and tables. The staff there, Becky Rodgers, in particular, was a joy to work with- very responsive and helpful (which was great as my order changed a lot of times). She made sure my order was right and worked closely with me to ensure everything was perfect. They delivered and picked up everything exactly as promised and were very professional and fast. They also have tons to choose from and will help you make the best choice for your money. Pricing was competitive too. Highly recommend!

I highly recommend Sit-Well Upholstery! I also researched places to take my half finished chair and was nervous it wouldn't be perfect as none of places have many reviews. I picked Sit-Well because it was close and I liked what I read. It was truly the best decision as they went far beyond the project and did an excellent job. True perfectionists and fast too. I was trying to reupholster my nursery chair and realized halfway in I was over my head. Called Saturday morning and Mike told me to bring it on in and he could finish it (for a very low price). The guys at the shop were wonderful, they let me hang out while Mike worked on it. Super honest, friendly, fast working and really care about doing the job right. They are artists. Mike surprised me and hand stitched a big piece I said I would do myself later and it looks better than how a high end furniture shop would do it. I was so impressed with this shop and the guys that work here, you really can't go wrong using them for your next project!

This is a great gymnastics school for serious gymnasts. My daughter has been going here for a year and a half and she has shown considerable improvement, is getting stronger, building confidence and it's helping improve her coordination. They change the circuits every two weeks so the routines are always fresh. I love the teacher Jade, she is my favorite. She challenges the kids and works with their skill level. Jade has a great attitude, is very enthusiastic and you can tell she really cares about instilling good form while building the fundamentals of gymnastics in her students. I highly recommend this school for kids 2 years and above!

I eat here about 2 times a week and it is one of my favorite restaurants! Best Vietnamese food around here. Flavor is fantastic!!!! I usually get one of 3 things; chicken pho soup, spring roll appetizer, bun #3. I can't tell you how much I love this restaurant because it's so tasty and you have to try it yourself. The food is fresh and flavor is on point. Service is great and meats are high quality.

We have been going to Stephen Cohen since my daughter was an infant. She takes part in his infant program and we are so blessed to have found Dr. Cohen. My daughter was diagnosed with an eye condition by another eye doctor in the  area. We went to Stephen to get a second opinion and haven't looked back. He is so incredibly thorough and knowledgable, I can't imagine there is any better eye doctor in AZ. He knows how to relate to kids and makes my 3 year old feel like it is fun to go to the eye doctor. They run a variety of tests to determine eye sight and use a few different instruments and equipment. It's all state of the art! I am very detail oriented and ask a lot of questions, Stephen has all the patience in the world and can explain pros and cons of treatment options, future condition risks, and red flag signs to keep an eye out for. His staff is incredibly professional and friendly. The wait is short and service is top notch. We love going to eye appointments now!

Ra is a restaurant that I go to often but never Yelp about for some reason. That will change today! My favorite things on the menu are the garlic edamame and kind crab roll. I order this every time I go there. The service is consistently good, food comes out quick and it's prepared well, the wait staff is professional and attentive. This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants to go to. It is also a fun place to get drinks at before you go out. Great vibe!

We have bought my 2 year old daughter countless instruments here and really love this place! We got her a little guitar, tambourine, flute and other cool things. This  music store is the real thing and the owner, Monty, is very helpful and knowledgable. He has music books and also does lessons. We will likely be doing those in the future as I've heard great things from other students. His prices are reasonable and we love going to his shop. My daughter was eyeing a big guitar on our last visit but I think we will wait till she's older! ; )

KS Cooling did a wonderful job on our AC from start to finish. I highly recommend them. Our AC went out on Sunday (it is 110 degrees right now yikes! ) and my husband got 3 quotes. The house is cool again and so pleased with our experience with KC. We were pretty vulnerable and Ken helped us make the best decision and installed the new unit quickly. Let me tell you why we chose KS Cooling. Ken was by far the most knowledgable, helpful, honest, and inexpensive. There are a ton of choices and Ken cut through them and helped us choose the right unit for our house. 5 ton, 14 seer energy efficient Trane for our 2,000 sq ft home. We had an old 5 ton 11 seer Lennox that broke. We verified his recommendation/pricing by 2 other reputable dealers who couldn't beat it. He educated us on the choices, answered all questions promptly and installed it quickly at the most affordable price. He had, by far, the most unbiased industry knowledge and knew a lot about which units require the most repairs since he does service also. I trust him and endorse his service fully. I saw the negative reviews and don't see where they came from- give him a chance. You won't regret it!

This place is great to visit during Christmas. The lit up Christmas tree that changes with music. Gingerbread light house, it was so neat! Wonderful experience! Be prepared to pay 30 dollars to park, 21 dollars per person to ice skate. No entrance fee which sped things up, which was nice. There was an annoying dj guy taking into a microphone while we were ice skating. Telling jokes etc. Please do not have him next year, Christmas music is enough for the ice skating Christmas experience. Now when I watch the special videos of my daughters first time Ice skating, that loud Dj voice is booming through my speakers- so obnoxious!  Next year we are going to get a table by the ice skating rink and have dinner there!

What a gem of a place, entirely unique to Phoenix and one of a kind. The pasties are soooooo good! I felt like i was in Germany being served authentic food. I had the chipotle pastie and ate so much that I was way too full. I only do that when I really like something. Highly recommend! Ps I'm picky too

I love this Home Depot! We started our house remodel and came here (and are still coming here- are remodels ever finished?!) what felt like every day to get items ranging from sheet rock, wood, paint to light fixtures, pocket doors and plants, tools etc. We have literally spent 10k plus here and likely more. This store has everything you might need and the staff is exceptional. They all have great customer service skills and it feels like a neighborhood store. What happened this week prompted me to write this review. We bought an expensive Halloween decoration last year and had issues with it and went to return it. I spoke with the Manager, Matt, who went above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Long story short, we were given store credit to make things right. It made me feel like a valued customer and I appreciated that Matt dared to do the right thing to retain a loyal customer. We ended up getting much needed closet doors for my daughter's room and picture is attached (the wall paint is Home Depot Behr too!). I am so happy and will always shop here. Also, my husband went back there today and a guy named Lewis spent 30 min sawing metal to make the new doors fit. They go above and beyond expectations and always want to help!

Any food lover has stand out memories of a truly fantastic meal. Our dinner at Mastros ranks high on my list of best food and dining experiences. We went here last Saturday night for our 5 year anniversary. The ambiance was perfect, dim lit with nice aesthetics. The service was on point, waiters took care of everything, were non obtrusive while being very attentive and accessible. The food, I don't know where to start as it was so incredible. They start with a basket of different breads; pretzel roll, Parmesan bread, and sourdough. All equally good and unique. I had the king crab legs and my husband ordered a filet.   Cooked perfect and fresh. We had garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus for  our sides. Sides are big so plan to share them. We had the butter cake for desert. We were both so impressed with the meal here! It was truly wonderful and worth every penny.

Tasty, Tasty! I haven't had good Indian food since I was in Seattle last winter. Indian Paradise was a great surprise. I read everyone's reviews on here about it, and since it is close to my work, decided to stop by for the lunch buffet. It was so good, flavorful with a good selection and they place had an understated atmosphere. The staff was very nice. They lunch buffet costs around $9 and an entree costs around $12. The meat is pretty good quality, though there is that is some fat in it but you can pick it out quite easily. The chicken tikki Marsala is to die for!

They don't care about customer satisfaction one bit! The atmosphere is very unsavory. Brightly lit, hot inside. The seats and tables look like lunchroom seating. There is a good old boys bar on the side, it's just weird. My whole family went there and the wait is longer than usual for food and the crab cakes are very gross. This was when I developed a problem with this place. I took a bite of the crab cake and it tasted like corn bread mixed with canned cat food, not a speck of crab to be found. I'm not sure how they can call it a crab cake and charge $8 for it. I told the waitress I wasn't happy with it and she was nice and said ok. We received the bill and  the uneaten crab cake charge was on it. I requested that the charge be removed and overheard her conversation with the owner. He said, "That's the way we make 'em and that's her problem if she doesn't like 'em!" They offered 10% off. I can't imagine anyone liking them as they were not even crab cakes which taste like they have crab in them. The cod was okay and I might have come back here if they had done the right thing. The management needs a lesson on customer service. We spent 50 dollars here and I left upset.

I love Jersey Mikes! Great quality meat and fresh toppings made the way you like it. I crave their sandwiches and eat here all the time. The bread is moist and perfect ratios on the sandwich, so perfectly filling. The staff is awesome and I look forward to my next visit. I may go there tomorrow in fact! Also, I ordered a tray on super short notice for a wedding getting ready meal. The staff made it happen and everyone at the party kept asking where they were from- it was that good!

Heart be still I loved this place. Way better than I expected. I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious, flavor great and quality was on point. For desert the sticky rice with mango, I dream about it now. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food. I'll be back!

This trampoline place is really fun for kids! Parents can't jump with kids, that's the main downfall. They have obstacle courses, bounce houses, slides, bull riding, really anything a kid likes. This is one of my favorite in terms of activities. I wish parents could participate too.

They have a good kids menu but my nanny went here today for lunch and found hair in both her meal and in my daughter's food. That is enough for me to decide not to go there. They refunded her money but it grosses me out.  I feel very disappointed as this place is cool and right by the splash pad which makes it very convenient. Hair in one plate is accidental but hair in two plates is just unsanitary. Hair me once shame on you, hair me twice shame on me!

I have been getting my hair done by Faith for  over 15 years. She and her staff are absolutely incredible. Faith is a master colorist and her haircuts are precision at it's best. I have seen Faith at different stages throughout my life, including when I tried to color and cut it myself (REALLY bad idea on a side note). She is a true pro and can fix anything. Her attention to detail and the way she listens and understands my hair preferences really sets her apart from other hair stylists. She delivers exactly what you want/envision and will always be 100% honest when I am suggesting a change that won't be ideal for me. Faith has cut and colored my hair for my wedding and other important occasions. She's up on all the trends and is also an cut and color educator. I highly recommend Faith if you want your hair done right!

Despite some of the bad reviews, my husband and I went and loved it! Well staffed, respectful, great sets and characters and lots of scares and things I've never seen in other haunted houses, like a crashed plane. It was worth the money and we were thoroughly entertained. Go!

My flowers were so beautiful and Jennifer's prices were very affordable too! So many people asked me if they were real, they were that beautiful. They were absolutely incredible and did the most wonderful job. I had no idea they would be so pretty, I was blown away. The flowers were delivered right on time and I didn't have to worry one bit about this part of my wedding. I recommend Ever after floral to anyone who ever needs a florist. At my consultation with Jennifer she picked up immediately the look I was going for and made great recommendations on my final pick. My flowers made my pictures and I am so glad I went with this company!!! A++++++++++++!

We stopped here on a whim last night right before they closed and I don't know why I haven't been here before! Service was fast and the sushi was delicious. I had the mussels to start then the dynamite roll. Excellent flavor and seafood was fresh and lots of it. The ambiance here is nice. Not a real fancy place but they have twinkly lights on the patio and its cozy. A little background on my sushi favorites- I like sushi broker, got sushi in Mesa and ra.

I hate this place! If you are into objectification of trashy club girls then this is the restaurant for you. Restaurant was filled with ugly, loser, ogling men. Food was gross, menu was lacking and service was crap. Our "waitress" sat down with us and acted flirty, then spilled my salad dressing all over the table and never came back and cleaned it up. Boobs don't make a meal good unfortunately. Will NEVER go back here again and recommend you don't waste your money or time.

You can't jump with your kids if you go here. So, if you are a parent of let's say a 3 year old, 6 year old and 15 year old - everyone cannot jump together. You would all jump in separate sections which may not even be near to each other. The toddler section is in another room not even near the main floor. This is not a good place for family bonding. Either that, or you can stand on the side and watch your family have fun without you. I appreciate the focus on safety but designated age/size areas isn't realistic in today's families where everyone is different ages and sizes. People want to jump with who they came with. Jumping in a small little square by yourself is not fun. Safety policies have gone too far. We all signed safety disclaimers which I'm sure removes any liability from the jump place. Lighten the rules so families can jump together!

This is my favorite new restaurant! My husband took me here on a rare night out away from our new baby and what a fantastic surprise. I am a very picky eater and Del Fresco managed to impress me with everything! The staff was some of the best in town- friendly, down to earth and knowledgable. The hostess and wine expert, Sarah,  surprised us at the end of our dinner with a desert on the house. She was so nice and they are lucky to have her. Delicious menu and I can't wait to go back. I had short ribs and my husband has the cheeseburger. Both were perfect. I had a crab cake appetizer and it was 90% crab, which is very generous and quite the accomplishment. The flavor was out of this world and the ambiance is right up my alley. Hip, cool, loungy with great lighting and zero pretentiousness. The people that work there make it a special experience and we will be going back very soon!

I have been to two shows here and love this small theatre house. It is in a very unassuming complex but inside they create the most magical stories with a very talented cast. I don't know why more people haven't reviewed this place. I have seen wonderful life and Oz here and had a wonderful time at both. The sets and costumes are great while the actors weave interesting stories with their excellent acting skills. This is not Gammage but it is so entertaining and a really fun way to spend a night if you are looking for something new to do or want to take a family/friend out for a night they won't forget. This is by all means a well staged production that is affordable. A hidden gem in the valley.

The food was ok and service was not great. When we got there we wanted to sit outside and it was chilly. They didn't offer to move a heater to our table. I ordered the margarita and it was way too sour. Took forever for them to bring us water. They were out of the meal I wanted and only had one left, I let my husband get it. It was the short rib and tasted like beef jerky. Too smokey and chewy. I ordered the sea bass and they brought the wrong dish. I ended up eating the salmon and chowder and it is an odd pairing. Pretty bland. Disappointing meal but I called and the manager offered to comp our next meal.

If you like waiting for absurd amounts of time for gross food this is your place. We came here with our baby and waited a total of an hour and 15 minutes to not receive our appetizer or my meal. The beers were good and waiter was nice. They brought us out the Mac and cheese bites as an apology for our wait and they were extremely bland AND there was no salt in sight. The horror!!!Our appetizer (which was caprese and should have been fast to make) never came. My husband's sandwich was okay and came at 45 minutes. While I waited... We finally gave up and they brought us our bill. I complained and the manager comped our meal and brought me the bruschetta to take home in the 9th hour. It was dry, small, unappetizing and I threw it away after picking at it.   Recommendation to management- make better food and deliver on time. Your menu is original, ambiance and concept is good and the neighborhood needs your type of restaurant. Go to the vig, le grande orange, and Postinos- take notes and copy their recipes.

It is nice to have other options at the mall for food and the food was good enough. I ordered the basil chicken. The rice was overcooked or maybe just not a good brand of rice. The chicken was pretty hard, not tender at all. The sauce was a bit over powering and I like flavor! The service was okay, the girl was nice. The bathrooms were really gross. I never write about bathrooms on my reviews but these seemed like they hadn't had a deep clean in months or even since opening. Grime on the toilets and floor edges with papers and trash pieces on the floor and counters. That makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the restaurant.

Honestly, I don't get the allure of Buck and Rider or Chelsea's kitchen. Good building ambiance and that's it. I don't think their food is very good. I love Le Grande orange so that is the exception. I think their food is trying too hard to be artsy when they should focus on just being good. There are weird combinations of food like shortbread crackers with crab dip. They crumbled when you tried to dip them and tasted chalky. Every time I have ordered at either place I struggle to find anything I  want on the menu AND I normally like their type of food. Most recently, we were there last Friday for a birthday. The food is over priced, service was not very good and I didn't like the way they cooked my order. I got the crab cakes and hubby ordered the chicken. Crab cakes were dry and over cooked on the bottom and there was minimal sauce. The salad was awkward with not enough dressing and huge leaves. My husband said his chicken was bland and really chewy. I think they cooked it on too low of a heat for a long time then heated it up too fast. The servers let us sit for extended time without taking our drink orders and it felt like we were bothering them when we asked for them to take menus from the table. We literally sat there for 30+ min at the end with no one asking if we needed another drink. I won't come back.

I wish I didn't have to go here as often as I do! I sincerely wish my 3 year old didn't like their mac n cheese but she does and so I'm forced to go. I inevitably order something gross from the menu with the hope that I might find something that I like. This has never happened in the last 2 years. Here is what I have had most recently: Chicken Caesar salad, Thai salad, Asian chicken salad, chicken soup, squash soup, and a chicken sandwich. My resounding feedback on all these items? Yuck. The chicken is poor quality and fatty, they use cheap iceberg lettuce on the salads which has almost zero nutritional value, the soups are bland/taste gross, and I didn't like any of it. I always throw away about half of my meal after picking out the majority of the fatty chicken. I feel sad because I am wasting food and my money. The small bread loaf that comes with the salads is pretty good. Hello carbs! Even the ice tea (all of them) taste weird. I know this because I tried them all searching for one I liked. They were weak and had a weird, chemical taste to them. I do agree with my daughter that the Mac n cheese is good, that's about it. Not 5 star good, more like good for a kid who doesn't eat any fancy food. It's not healthy either. I see grown adults in line at Panera and Paradise Bakery and truly don't get it. Are they all ordering the Mac n cheese?
