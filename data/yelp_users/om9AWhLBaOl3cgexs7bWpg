Very pleased with my trip here. they saved me from being robbed and overcharged by Audio Express. These guys are helpful, friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. I got more bang from my dollar here than the quote I got from that other place. I showed them the quote and they showed me that there were 2 instances of being charged for things that I didn't need nor would have helped accomplishing keeping my OEM controls etc.   Do yourself a favor and stop by here for you car audio needs!!!

Will never go here or refer anyone, more than likely will make sure everyone I know hears to stay away from here. They gave me a quote for 2k of which had duplicate parts, missing parts and just a whole nightmare experience. There is obviously plenty of parts and they list out each one and charge you for each one, even labor. I went to another outfit and got more than what I bargained for here at less than the quote.

Got charged $9.99 for a Super Nachos, with tax $10.57. Ya, there was a lot of food in the box, but you know what, i'm not going to pay you sit down restaurant prices for a fast food drive thru experience, it's just not gonna happen.

Shopping around for companies, I ran across this company via Yelp.  I called, Mike answered, pulled his vehicle over, and talked to me about my roofing concerns. We scheduled an appointment, of which I forgot to write down, and forgot the appointment, yet he showed up the day and time that we scheduled. Mike is very professional, knowledgeable, informative, and he took time to explain the repairs necessary. As well, he did some patching that needed to be done immediately without charging me, mind you I was only looking for an estimate to replace the roof.   Mike is licensed, bonded, and insured, and he carries the credentials with him of which all verified upon my checking them. I do not have the exact date of which I will have the work done, but I know that on that day I will call Mike and schedule him to do that job. This is saying a lot, Mike's bid was not the lowest I had, but, I had never done a roof before, all this is new to me, and he made me comfortable in the process, let's face it, we are talking about a large sum of money, so I was slightly nervous. Matter of fact, I think highly enough of my experience with Mike thus far that I am taking my time to review and recommend him. Would be much easier to something else more fun.   Call Mike at Stell Roofing, I think you'll be glad you did.

It is a pleasure to compose this review and I find it necessary to share this with others because when you find good service--which can be somewhat out of the ordinary today--I think it's important to share that with other people who may be in similar situations such as mine.   As a first time home owner on a very conservative budget during a recent out of ordinary storm in my area it came to my attention that I had leaks in my roof. I've heard many horror stories about the cost of replacing the roof and so I was very concerned. I grabbed the yellow pages and started reading reviews online of various roofing companies and I started making calls. Many companies did not answer their phone, were not available, or required me to leave a message on a machine, and then I found Stell Roofing. I made the call and got a hold of Mike Stell who was driving at the time, he immediately pulled over and I explained my concerns and made an appointment for the next Thursday to come over to give me an estimate of which he stated would be free of charge. Now, I ended up making appointments with roughly nine different roofing companies--most were 2 or 3 weeks out just to get the estimate--and so honestly, I forgot about the appointment I made with Mike. But as promised, Mike showed up as arranged and at the time we did arrange as I'm feeling sheepish for having forgotten. Mike was very knowledgeable, courteous, and very polite. He walked my roof, and he even pointed out some areas that were probably damaged in a previous storm that I was unaware of. Thanks to that information I was able to follow up with the insurance company whom had sent an adjuster and confirmed what Mike had said. I want to mention that none of the other companies spotted those areas or made mention of them. Mike explained in detail the work necessary, how it would be performed, he provided his credentials, which included a copy of his license and the binder with his insurance company both of which verified good when I called to check.  Mike's bid was not the lowest, nor the highest. There were some companies that arrived at my door with a fancy folder and some reading material, and those folks were 30% and more higher in their rates, and quite honestly, I did not believe or feel that they had the same knowledge base or expertise that Mike did. This alone was priceless to me, and one of biggest reasons that I decided to use Stell Roofing. It took me a month to put together the finances needed in order to have the work performed, and when I called Mike back he remembered me, he scheduled with me and his crew completed work yesterday.  I will say, I was completely impressed with the crew that arrived, they were all very polite, courteous, and during the course of work there were no communication barriers with any of them. Junior introduced himself, explained what they would be doing, asked if I had any questions, and then proceeded to direct the work flow. They covered all areas around my house with tarps to collect debris and any items that would need to be discarded. They protected the plants and all areas that might be of concern. And from the time they arrived at 7AM to the time they left, it was nothing but steady and consistent work. They never once bothered me or the household during the entire install over the course of 3 days. They did not ask to use facilities or need drinks, and while I would make available if requested, I actually prefer not to have people coming in and out of my home. And there were roughly 6-7 people here which could lead to a lot of traffic.  When I went out to check progress periodically, they were always busy and at work, I think they did an incredible job. They worked well and completed the tear off in one day and when they left, they cleaned up every area, they asked me if I had any items they could take to the dump with them, how many companies would do that. They used a magnet to ensure that staples and nails went with them too, they also used a blower and quite frankly I think my yard looked better when they left than when they had arrived.  In closing, I highly recommend Stell Roofing. I would use them again if necessary although I'm hoping not to have to :) He is honest, knowledgeable, informative, attentive, and well priced. I have a great looking roof up there with a lifetime warranty, and I feel confident that I made the right choice and found a great roofing company. Give them a call, tell em Duane referred ya!!!

I have never had a better experince in a vape store. The crew is outrageously friendly, knoweledgeable, and generous in sharing their time and talent. No pressures, just a mindset and mentality to serve folks who come in with lots of hospitality and humor.   BTW::::They don't charge sales tax!!

A realtor friend of mine once told me how significant trees are to the overall property, and the value of a home. They can make a difference in the thousands, and for this reason, I knew I wanted a professional person and company working on my trees. I have seen yard crews in the neighborhood hacking away at some of my neighbors' trees and they just don't look right.Jerry with J and J made a huge impression upon me and I had a good feeling about his ability to do the work and so yesterday I had him trim and prune out 3 of the trees at my home. Needless to say, I am happy that I did so. Jerry provided quality and professional work. He arrived on time, he did his work quickly, efficiently, and safely which matter a great deal to me. I am very pleased with the look of the trees and my property as well being his clean up work was far better than others I have used in the past. As well, I found the price to extremely reasonable and affordable and certainly money well spent. If you are in need of tree and other work at your home, I highly recommend J and J Tree Care. Thanks again Jerry.
