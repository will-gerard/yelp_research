Service was awful. The place looks run down. Bought this off groupon and even with the discount would not go again.

Love the fontina burger, the history and the cool bathrooms. Seriously, it's good food. Can get crowded at times, but always worth the wait. Kids are addicted to the melted peanut butter sandwich

I love it, the prices are reasonable. The food is delish. Nice portions, my favorite is the tempura. The drinks are great and it's a nice, darkly lit, no frill restaurant. This is one of our favorites

Not at all authentic New York. Booths are all cut up. Food mediocre at best. Like many others, I wanted to like it, but couldn't.

Menu never changes. I keep hoping they will have something new that I would like, but the food is average on a good day and the service is awful. Called and asked about a menu item - was told she didn't know and it was too busy to ask.

If you have ever eaten Mediterranean food you would not be impressed. Chicken shawarma was dry and the seasonings were awful. It was empty on a Saturday night. Never again

Very cute restaurant. The arugula salad was nice and fresh. The Brussel Sprout pizza would have been better with more Brussel sprouts. Had an epicenter Amber Ale that was delish. The decorum was tasteful, I didn't think it was terribly pricey as some of the previous reviews. The deserts did not seem right, although we didn't try them. A true zeppoli would never have ice cream and whipped cream and cinnamon.

The Pernil was very nice as was the arroz con gandules and the frijoles. The bistec was a bit tough and the platanos were a tad salty. Other than that, it's very authentic.
