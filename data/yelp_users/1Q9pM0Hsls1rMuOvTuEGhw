keep this place clean! whwn I was sitting by the cash register I could see how dirty it was. Brown paper towels,papers,trash can full  and walking buy like there was nothing on the floor.it was a slow night. Nobody was there but my couisn and me. Please keep your work area clean cause it makes jack in the box dirty and ghetto.

Please tell the ladies at starbucks or the company of it to not hire rude people,we had such a bad experience there the faps were so nasty,they werent evan sweet.we told them what they did wrong and try to tell us that it tastes like that and they will charge us if we ask again! They need to learn how to make one cause it doesnt taste like plain coffee. please do something about it or i will.
