Standard scottsdale decor and house music playing.....so I knew what to expect. Had pan fried pork potstickers. The wraps were straight up rubber. The filling was like well........wet cat food. I have personally wrapped a few thousand of theese AND cooked them and this was a poor attempt at best. Our food hit the table 30 secs later. Kudos the chef for the timing. Mongolian beef was good. I like the thick slices of beef but a little overkill on the scallions. Now desert. . Ugh.....flourless chocolate cake. Staight out of the box and fridge. No bueno. Not to mention our waitress said they messed it up 3 times in back. Then dumped an astoundingly gross amount of raspberry on plate and got it out 15 mins later. Our server was nice and did her job....and thanks to the bartender for the grasshoper! They are the only reason I gave 2 stars. Wont be back for that food at $14 bucks a plate! Im goin back to totties!

Came in on a recommendation from a friend, and boy I wasn't disappointed! The Mexican street corn was perfect, I'm a sucker for cotija! The cochinita pibil was great too. Awesome atmosphere and music as well. But the highlight was our server Hayley, my wide and I are both in the industry and can be tough customers to impress. It was honestly refreshing to have her as our server. Great recommendations, super positive and upbeat professional young lady. We will most definitely be returning to try the Adobado she told us was so amazing. Thanks again to Hayley for giving us the best service we can honestly say we've ever had.
