I've been eating here for the pat few years. I found Tottie's by doing a search for  best asian food in scottsdale.  I have to agree. I've had asian food all over the world. New York, Europe, San Francisco.  This place is spectacular.  I love the panang chicken.  Highly highly recommend this place

Not good.  Don't understand why they are open and Lo Lo's closed.  The food tastes terrible.  Meat was rough.  I had orange chicken.  Would never go back

Best Chinese I've had in Az.  Very authentic.  Not fancy in terms of a restaurant but the food is unreal

This place is absolutely spectacular. The ambiance is uniquely perfect for Arcadia.  I am sure this place is going to be a big hit!  Started off with oysters. The steak and the halibut was amazing.  Desert just showed up.  I'm told the cake is "pretty awesome."  I'm working on the six pack secret diet, not giving in to temptation tonight....  French pressed coffee is great, I usually don't like coffee.   I'd highly recommend this place
