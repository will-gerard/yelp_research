I know next to nothing about sports. Nada. Zip. But I had the best time at this gay sports bar! This place is pure fun. The drinks are very strong and the bartender was very cute and friendly. The music was good for it being a sports bar. Strange thing though.... nobody seemed to be actually watching sports on the many televisions located around the bar. Saw somebody eat a nice looking salad next to me. Smelled heavy on the garlic but that may be to taste. I didn't feel out of place at all even though my favorite sport is reading. Just a really fun time that is easy on your wallet. Definitely going to be going back there soon!

I come in here almost every morning for a smoothie and man are they good. I recently found out about the the pinkberry smoothie and I am addicted. The store is very clean and the staff are always friendly and helpful. After the pinkberry I love the blueberry bliss. They also make wheatgrass juice which is good for my workout. I simply love this place so much that I go almost everyday before work. Highly recommended.

Went with a friend for lunch on Sunday and it was alright. The place was decorated in a cute way and the wait staff was attentive. The fried zucchini was good. My friend liked her spaghetti with meat sauce and I enjoyed my ravioli. Skip the grainy garlic bread but substitute the tasty French bread instead! Spumoni was good. Basically a step below Olive Garden in both quality and price. Not bad but not great either. Decent.

Went last night to see a friend on open-mic night and it was really fun. Even though the comics were amateurs they were all pretty funny. The drinks were nice and strong. Excellent location next to many fun spots and restaurants. Very friendly staff. I will definitely go again.

We have been wanting to try this place out for a while but there was always a long line during peak times. However last night we went out a little early (5:30PM) and found that there was no line and plenty of tables. Make sure you park in the back and don't stop in front of the restaurant itself or you will block traffic on 16th Street. Plenty of parking in the back. Besides the back and sides of the building are covered in these beautiful murals. Definitely worth a few photos.   We walked in from the back door. The restaurant is really cute and homey. Very clean. There is a really cute little bar up in the front. Our server sat us. He had the most beautiful accent. I could have listened to him describe the specials all night. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and the ingredients and how things were prepared. He was also very warm and friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job.   Instead of chips and salsa he brought out the most delicious bread along with an amazing olive spread. I loved it and I really am not a big fan of olives. It was that good. My friend loves olives and she was in heaven. We both stated to get excited about what was in store for us.    We started off with the signature "Lowrider" margarita as it was half off on happy hour. Normally it is $12 but we got them for only $6. At first we were startled at the regular price but after a few sips we found it a bargain as it was very strong and it was half-off due to happy hour. And very tasty. But if your driving you may only want to have one just to be safe. (NB Cafe Barrio is on major bus lines so public transit is always an option,)   I had the chicken enchiladas with brown mole sauce. The enchiladas were amazing. The mole sauce had hints of smoldering chocolate and was so tasty. I fell in love. The sizes were generous as well. The main dish was accompanied by these amazing mashed potatoes which were out of this world. The food was excellent. So good in fact that we didn't save any room for desert.  The only downside to this cafe is the price. It was a little on the pricey side with our bill coming out to a little over $60 for two people. However, for a special treat type place with a date Barrio Cafe can not be beat. The food was very fresh, very tasty and its not your usual Mexican menu. I really enjoyed my food and my time at Barrio Cafe and will happily go again.

Went here for lunch yesterday and it was so good I am still thinking about it. I had the grilled shrimp and St. Louis ribs and they were excellent. The wait staff were very warm and friendly and the manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was okay. The shrimp was very tasty while the ribs were out of this world. The garlic mashed potatoes were good along with the corn on the cob. My iced tea was very crisp and refreshing. My fellow guests loved their food. I even had enough to take home.  All of this for a decent price. I left very happy.

The BBQ here is amazing. There is a large crowd especially on Fridays so you may have to park down the block. Luckily I work right across the street. You get alot of meat for you money.

Since I work near here I go here sometimes for lunch with my co-workers. I have nothing but good things to day about this place. The food is inexpensive yet tasty and of good quality. The staff is helpful and friendly. Today I got the calzone and it was excellent. Tasty, flaky crust and plentiful tasty fillings. The iced tea was good. I know I can come here and get a good cheap meal. The decor is nice and the place is clean. Clean bathrooms.

The food was gringo interpretation of Mexican food. Which meant the sauce was not spicy but bland with a side of mild. I swear the rice was from Uncle Ben's it was so bad. My chicken tortilla soup was tasty. Typical suburban crowd of tired moms, bitter dads and unruly children screaming everywhere. Our waiter was efficient but odd. The chips and salsa were good but its hard to mess that up.  If we were not meeting friends here I would have chosen a better chain restaurant or better yet a local one. Hell the food from the local food carts downtown is better. Boring is the word that sums it up. Boring.

Visited an old friend who is staying there this weekend and Montelucia is unbelievably beautiful. The buildings and interiors of the public areas are simply incredible and exotic. Like everyone says the staff is so warm and friendly. Everyone says hello and smiles. I had a wonderful time.

Went in last night with a friend, looked around, walked out. Maybe we got there way too early but it had an eerie waxworks museum quality to it. Strange people hanging out in the parking lot in back. Almost indescribable. A co-worker always goes on about how hot the bartenders are here but I was so confused walking in due to the atmosphere I didn't even notice the bartender. Will have to go back for a full review.

This place makes incredible sandwiches and is perfect for a quick lunch if you work around the area. My favorite is the French dip and my co-workers love the croissant sandwiches. The soups change daily and are home made and tasty. Their cookies are really good too. The people who work here are very friendly. I have not had their breakfasts yet becuase I am usually a few minutes from being late to work in the morning but I bet they are good.

Went for a quick lunch with two coworkers and I was pleasantly surprised on my first visit. First impressions were that it was a very clean establishment and the counter help made me feel welcome. The menu was easy to figure out and the staff was very helpful explaining some of the more esoteric offerings. I had the fish and chips and it was excellent! Lightly breaded fillets that tasted like fish and the fries were seasoned with oregano and they were really good! Coworker 1 had the chicken wrap and it looked delicious filled with big chunks of chicken and Greek vegetables. He really like his. Coworker 2 had a chicken skewer platter with rice, salad and pita bread. He said his food tasted excellent. We shared the humus and to be honest I am not a fan of humus in general but this humus was really good! The owner lady was very involved with the front counter which I always take as a good sign in a restaurant.  I will be back soon! Very good place to eat and the price was not bad at all.

So I went here for lunch by myself the other day for lunch and it was just as good as before. A little busier but that is fine. The nice Greek lady behind the counter was really nice. Good food at a good price.

Since I work downtown I come here for lunch at least 3 times a week and I have never left disappointed. My favorites are the Italian Beef Sandwich and the Wall Street pizza (loaded with different kinds of meat). The beef sandwich is really tasty with a generous helping of beef, a mountain of cheese and a bunch of aus-jus. I also really like the lunch deal they have where you can get two slices of pizza of your choice plus a drink for less than $8 out the door. They make the crust with this special water which makes it very tasty and an amazing texture. The lemoncello cake is outstanding as well. All of the servers and staff are very warm and friendly, with a special shutout to Tawnya! I have also had their buffalo wings which are big and meaty with tasty sauces. My better half loves the Buffalo Chicken Caesar Salad. A wonderful choice for either lunch or dinner.

Went here for lunch and the food was incredibly tasty! Portions are very large. I got the pork schnitzel and it came with two huge pork cutlets breaded and cooked to perfection and covered with this really good mushroom gravy. The Swedish potato salad was so good, and I don't even care for potato salad. The owners are incredible friendly too. I can't wait to go back here again.

I went here for lunch today after hearing my co-workers rave about the place. I was very happy that I went since the food was really good. You can build your own burger out of a very large array of choices. I got the basic bacon cheeseburger with swiss  cheese and was very happy. The burger was cooked to perfection and very juicy and full of taste. The fries were really good too. It is a very good local place and the staff are really warm and friendly. I would highly recommend it for a good tasty lunch. The only reason it didn't rate 5 stars was the fact they don't server fresh brewed tea but rather that tea from a soda fountain. Other than that, everything was great and a great price! :-)

I love this place! The food is so tasty and well priced. My co-workers and I go here for lunch often and they love it too. My favorite lunch is the dark meat chicken teriyaki with California rolls. The portion sizes are just enough for a healthy lunch. And it is under $10. They always have good fresh brewed iced tea as well. The wait staff are all so friendly and helpful. I just love this place.
