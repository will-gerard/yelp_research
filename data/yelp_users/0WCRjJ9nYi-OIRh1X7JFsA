My first time here a couple weeks ago. I got the deluxe pedicure and the girl did a very good job. The enivorment is pretty and the water is actually hot which I enjoyed. I will be back soon

I highly recommend this vet. The staff and vet is great and they actually genuinely care about you and your pet. In August I had to do the unfortunate thing of putting down my 16 year old dog. They make sure to do everything they can to make it as comfortable as it can be and allow you to come in the back instead of walking through the front door of the store. They also respect the time you need with your pet. They also took the time to send me a sympathy card that was signed by everyone in the office, which I really appreciated.

I love this place! I go here often for lunch and they have good lunch specials/prices. You get a lot of food so it's really a good value. I am obsessed with their Tzatziki Sauce and always have to request more. I recommend this place to anyone who likes greek food.

I tried this place for the first time today and I loved the food. It was a great deal for the lunch special and you get soup with it. I ordered the Cashew Chicken with Hot and Sour Soup and it by far was the best chinese food i have had for a while. I will go back again.

horrible service, very rude staff. if you are white you will not receive good service, all 3 tables that were asian families were helped and we were passed by every time. We had to get up to get refills, boxes and the check. the food is good but i will never return.
