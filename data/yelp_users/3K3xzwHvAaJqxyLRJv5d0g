All i can say is that no matter what you get .. it's not just good, it's great.  I've never been disappointed and love the atmosphere and fresh ingredients.  The best part about eating here is that i don't feel bogged down and tired after I eat here like I do in other restaurants which i really appreciate.

We had a wonderful time in Las Vegas when we stayed at the Mandalay Bay.  The rooms smelled fresh and clean, they were well maintained and beautiful.   We had a couple of little snags with reservations, but their staff were excellent in getting past those speed bumps and made the entire experience super nice.  I'd highly recommend staying here...the pools are amazing, the food is great, and it's a nice central location to get anywhere on the strip.

This taxi cab company in mesa to my house in tempe to pick me up... I told Berto over there that I was in a hurry and asked if they could help me out.  They were fast too..within 15 minutes they were here and i was on my way.  I can't tell you what a relief it was to get to the airport on time.  This is WAY better than any airport shuttle service out there.  It cost a few bucks more..but that was a small price to pay to make my flight.  Thank you Union Cab Company....you made my day!

The food is pretty good, and the staff is very friendly and nice.  I like to take my son here (he's the only other one in our house that will eat sushi) and we hang out here and talk and eat.   Nice casual place for a normal meal.  Nothing too fancy here ... which is all right.

We went here for the first time yesterday to support Marcos De Niza High School and were amazed at how we have never heard of them before.   The food was spectacular!    We got a thin crust pizza and a meatless calzone which was extremely good.  We will be going back there for sure.  Thanks Clockwork for supporting our local schools!

I think I may have died and gone to heaven.  In all seriousness...they make some crazy good sandwiches there.  I keep wanting to try other types, but I keep getting the Bobby and the hot pastrami which are both to die for.   The best part is if you get a big one...you can easily make two full meals out of it.  Thanks Capriotti's for some great food!

So i booked this hotel 3 months prior so I could crash for 4 hours during a layover.  I arrive at the hotel at 6:am and THEY WILL NOT CHECK YOU IN.  They said they indeed have many rooms open, but they won't let you check in before noon.  To make matters worse, they won't refund or cancel your reservation, So i'm sitting here in their lobby not able to get into my room that I paid for and cant get in.  This is awful .... DONT BOOK HERE!!

We stopped in here because they were supporting the local High School and love to come back here pretty regularly.   I love supporting small businesses that support our youth.  BTW their yogurt is really ... really good.

Be Careful...This Place Can Be Dangerous ... if you're on a diet.  The donuts here are seriously good!  We have been to several locations and used to drive 40 minutes to one out on the east side in Gilbert or Chandler.  When they opened up here, I knew I was in trouble,  because i have to drive by there daily and be tempted to go in there.  This is truly a treat and the store is very nice inside.  I'm glad someone gets up early to make the donuts!!!   Whoever you are .. you need a raise (or more tips) because you are a magician.  Thanks Bosa...you guys are great!
