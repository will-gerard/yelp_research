I have had some good digestive experiences here.   Also, I have kin who works here... so that's another incentive for you to step in.

We probably should not have waited as long as we did, for what we were served.   It's not bad, I guess... if you feel it is adventurous to try flavors fused with one another. I'm down with the fusion, only if it's done tastefully. I mean, after all, you are there for the taste.   Seared tuna... was far from seared. They just let the flimsy slivers of tuna saturate in the acid for a bit to give it a seared look. But uh, it was missing the crisp in the sear, and all I could taste was the acidity and pepper sprinkled on top.  Takoyaki... supposedly had some octopus bits in it. Luckily, I found 1/4 of a tentacle in these things. However, this was sabotaged by the sauce these little balls were drowning in. Too much basil in the hoisin or something.  The caterpillar... haha. Cute, but was searching for some significant pieces of eel in here. Sushi rice was a bit soggy too.   Ebi-ten, basically udon/soba (opted udon) with two shrimp tempura, was okay. I've whipped this up myself before, so...  Wow, unfortunately not very memorable. Good job, presentation... but not so much a sensation.

I look forward to perusing their menu, but consistently ordering the polish sausage with everything on it- tomatoes, peppers, onions, and celery-salted pickle. It's GOOD, juicy, and the bun is basically overpowered by the sausage. Best thing is the "SNAP!" when you bite into the immensely caloric greatness.   I should run a marathon and head over there now.

Yelp alerted me that I have a review to complete, from nearly 2 years ago.   I remember how I felt about this place back then, and still feel strongly about this place now. Recollections of how much I would not like to return to this place again.   Find a place that serves Cuban-inspired food, or if there is a frozen aisle that does, heat it up in a microwave, transfer it onto a plate, and voila! Of course you'll remember to remove that non-microwaveable plastic film that Havana overlooked.

much overdue review, but...  i guess it doesn't matter what was ordered here, because somebody has a heavy hand as far as salty condiments are concerned, so dishes are peculiarly salty, and it is possible that while en route to our table, someone surreptitiously powdered the food with yes, even more salt. flavor isn't necessarily bad, but if you didn't know, i prefer a blend of flavor(s), not just a flavor (salty).   if you are luckily having salticious cravings, and would like to experience edema and other related salt and water retention, this is a great place.

Haha at Buca.   Yeah, you have an array of typical dishes to choose from, but considering these are quite, SIMPLE, Buca still cannot master them.   Thought the chopped salad would be awesome...but, I should have  known, they used machetes to chop this dish, and then served us the bottom of the bulk, which means, sweaty, liquefied salad. Also, I don't mind having to order a 'side' of pasta, but I'm just so flummoxed by the choices: spaghetti with marinara? or fettucine alfredo?...choices, choices, choices! I mean, these two just pair so well with the porchetta rustica :(sarcasm):  Apple crostata= standard apple pie. No warm apples, flaky crust, as falsely advertised on the menu.   I should have learned from my first experience here.   Good as a soup line!

I've passed by Halo numerous times, but due to my indecision, have never stopped by.   From the outside, Halo is small box that you can't look into unless you make your way to the back.   Inside, Halo is a spacious, clean, and quiet place. I was greeted by the cute gal Kelsey, and then introduced to my piercer, Glen.   Mr. Glen was very helpful in terms of what jewelry would/would not look good on me. At first, his words of advice were better off dusted off my shoulder- he was rather blunt with his suggestions. But then I realized, THIS GUY KNOWS HIS STUFF, so I'd assume HE DOES KNOW HIS STUFF, and wouldn't suggest something horrid. Also, he has a handful of interesting stories to share while prepping.  For my nostril, I declined the diamond topped stud, and went for a simple titanium one, instead of the ring that I wanted initially.   Low and behold, it didn't look so bad, and I may return to get the other side pierced just for symmetry.

To consume what Lalibela's has to offer is essential to a proper functioning system.   It's good for you.   It's also great not to fret over utensils, and rather... use those fingers.   GREAT!

If you just "want" dim sum, go here. If you are "craving" dim sum, go elsewhere (take a 5 hour drive west to neighboring state, California).  Anyway, I've been visiting Golden Buddha in the noontime for roughly 2 years now. I believe they moved from their original site (7th St. & Osborn), formerly "China Doll." Relocation brought along better atmosphere and smiling faces. This does not mean, better dim sum. But since we are in Phoenix, I will settle for what they have to offer.   Be mindful of the dim sum tab. It's itemized high-medium-low.   Shaomai can be found as combinations of pork/mushroom, shrimp, or shark fin (which should not be confused as true shark bits, as the shaomai is prepared to look like a shark's fin). These picks are okay...perhaps on a better day shao mai will be served in less-rigid, or fresher wrappers. Potstickers are okay as well, just the usual scallion and pork, and dry wrapper. The baby pork ribs in light black bean sauce and jalapenos is alright, but sometimes lacks in taste. Tripe is also served in its bare minimum...so if you enjoy the texture and flavor of tripe, try this with its clear sauce and thinly sliced carrots and celery.   Buche (that's what I call it), or fried sesame balls are also available, although if you wait until dessert, they will also be a bit stiff. There are a few other things that may be "spotted" but are not worth mentioning.   Don't order from their lunch menu, as you can find these over-salted dishes at Panda Express anyway.   Overall, dim sum at Golden Buddha is a place to go if you are around the vicinity and feel like having something apart from the usual fast food. However, discriminating palates- beware.

now i've discovered why i've never given this place a bother.  as previous reviews have attested-- service is non-existent; instead, its the peripheral glance of the same servers rushing past your table as if they were real fucking busy. really? we've been waiting for half an hour or so already. deciding that my ass had become numb from waiting, we managed to flag down a hastily walking server and finally gave our order.   so, pomegranate margarita is OK. seafood kibis is frozen product, thawed, fried, not very seafood. lamb kibis is the less appetizing $12.95 unfolded version of much tastier gyro that can be found elsewhere for half the price. i suppose its good we were saved the task of having to answer to "how's everything tasting?"...because, quite precisely, everything is not tasting [good] at all.   fez is one of those places that you go to, wait a long time (in hopes that the food redeems itself), and receive a server who places more importance on their strut and getting your friends number. ultimately you are left with underwhelming food, money and time, wasted.

Little Saigon, such a quaint little place in [usually] desolate old town Glendale.   Weekends are reasonably busy here, but we came on a Thursday...and were basically the only ones there. Is 8pm really that late??? Come on, night owls, where are you?  Ordered the delicious spring rolls (as described in the review below mine). The sweet fish sauce is such a great complement for these things. Also had the egg crepe, filled with bean sprouts and shrimp. Bean sprouts were fresh, crisp...but the shrimp were a little overcooked. Piling the crepe onto a bed of lettuce, mint leaves, and lemongrass was so refreshing. You can eat so much of this stuff, and not feel guilty. Those were just appetizers.   Now onto the main course. I'm always indecisive about which soup I want, but I settled with the #12, which consisted of rice noodles in beef broth, beef and pork slices, tendon, tripe, and meatballs (consistency was similar to that of the meat in a gyro). With some generous dashes of sriracha, chili paste, and fish sauce, I was in another world. In addition, this lovely medley was served in a king size bowl. Thumbs up to that, and to myself... for finishing the whole thing.   Everyone I dined with was quite satisfied with their dishes, and I would have liked to share a description of each dish, except I was too consumed with my own bowl that I became oblivious of my surroundings about 20 minutes into the meal.   Towards the end, the endearing chef made an appearance and surprised us with dessert- on the house. Nice!   I enjoy coming here... very homey, and lighthearted people. I'll probably visit again this week!

Dinner. This visit was premeditated. I fasted for most of the day and abandoned the health-conscious mentality.   My stomach was stirring up mixed feelings prior to the long drive to this place, due to some who did, or did not like Fogo E Brasa. Thoughts: 1) hope the drive is worth it, and 2) being challenged by hunger  So, arrived around 8ish, snooped around the salad bar while slyly checking out the meats in the kitchen. Salad bar was alright... you can have potato or pasta salad any day, so I skipped that. The fresh calamari looked appetizing, but it seemed as if everybody had picked out all the "good" parts. I think it was scallop ceviche, or some shellfish ceviche... it was good. But again, the good parts had been captured.   Were served sides of rice, beans, pico de gallo, and breaded bananas. I thought I would enjoy the slightly carmelized, fried plantains that I'm used to, but unfortunately, not here.   Onto to the M E A T.  And, into my intestines, still slowly digesting: ham, chicken enveloped in bacon, barbecue chicken, sausage (slightly dehydrated, but okay), trip tip, garlic steak (hm... this thing was tough, and will ignore next time), sirloin, prime rib, and lamb (favorite, prepared well- tender, pink middle, familiar aroma).  Whoa, and you would think, after those generous cuts of meat, I'd be done. Not quite yet. Of course, you need to round it out with something to cleanse the palate. So, behold the cart of desserts. I chose the tiramisu, and I guess the gal sensed my hungry eyes, and gave me a large piece of this tiramisu. It was good tiramisu, but I couldn't taste the undertones of rum. I'll have to say I've had better.   I consumed copious amounts of water thanks to the attentive waiters. Also had some red, and capirinha to aid the flow of food in system, and lilliputian-sized espresso to end the night.   Now, I'm just feeling all sorts of lethargy and other things that prevent me from being productive. My initial thoughts were tended. I'll drive here again, and the food did, indeed conquer me. I won't be hungry for days.

Stuck in the area for a 2 hour oil change, I didn't feel like having McDonald's for breakfast, nor did I feel like just sitting around auto shop and watching a snowy television screen.  So I walked, and with de Sade in purse, sat comfortably in Cabin Coffee Espresso for some caffeine. The interior was pretty dark- my eyes had a hard time transitioning from sunshine to oil lantern lighting, but they had some "hip" tunes on play.   I ordered the large Mexican Mocha Latte...not bad. The coffee proved a lot more robust than Starbucks. Cinnamon lingered on my palate well after I had finished my drink. Even caught some hints of cayenne...that may have enhanced that certain "spice"...but I'm sure that was just psychological.   Anyway...good place for coffees. They've got a pretty extensive list of flavors from classic to exotic. I'll have to update upon my next visit.

Hmm...   Nonplussed. Mind draws a blank when I think of a positive, and grows tired of all the negative that begin to stir.   So, the interior is somewhat attractive, but does not distinguish itself from other restaurants. I may not have ordered the piece de resistance here, but I did order something I thought would ignite "tasty" in my mouth, but didn't. Overcooked eggs, mutilated, also overdone chorizo. Chewed this stuff with a crying smile. Don't order off the Sunday brunch.   One of those places not worth the drive.

perhaps you might start with:  baked goat cheese pumpkin soup beet salad   then:   pork chile verde the pork chop  roasted chicken cioppino (this is no longer featured on their menu) forbidden rice bowl   end with:   sticky toffee pudding   -------- st. francis aint so bad; i mean, they're actually pretty great. go! actually, go here before public market cafe, because then that's a different story...

Firstly, there are very few Filipino eateries in Phoenix, so I'll give props to this one here.  Located in the rear end of an old plaza on 35th ave. & Thunderbird, you might miss it, so drive, and you will find it in the corner between a furniture store and Abacus Inn.   Inside you will find amiable Filipinas that will greet and accomodate your current food cravings.   I ordered the Pancit Palabok and was familiar with the rice noodles covered with orange-colored sauce, scallion, shrimp, chicharon and an egg to top it off. Puto was also served on the side. Not bad.  My friend ordered shrimp sinigang. The broth was rightly acidic, infused with the natural juices of the whole shrimp (heads included...for those of you who care to know).   Due to time constraints, I was not able to try any of the "sweets." I did spot some bibingka, an ube dessert, and some cassava...they also have other things like cannoli and cookies (but that's not the reason you're there.   I'll surely eat here again, and will revise this review.  But at the end, make sure to provide them with a "salamat", or thank you in return for their great effort to advertise Filipino delicacies, that Phoenix needs more of.

Just returned from sleep inducing dinner at Pappadeaux's.   In my stomach: half dozen (actually 8) raw oysters, Pontchartrain fillet, and peanut butter cheesecake.   Service was A+... luckily Justin (our waiter) was a jovial one.   Will update next time with details.   My system will have the sweetest sleep tonight.

Not sure if it was too late (9 pm?...haah), or if those in the kitchen were cooking with drowsy palates...  ANYWAY, after driving around with indecisive passengers the other night, we all finally agreed on this place. Initially excited... we were not so much enthralled by dinner's end.   I got the Award Winning Gyro Dinner. Personal opinion of this- not very award winning, and did not even intrigue my eyes. Beef and lamb were dehydrated and vegetables originated from a freezer bag. Was given scarce pieces of pita (should have just brought my own bag of pita chips since this was the case), and the tzatziki was not the distinct  blend of yoghurt accompaniment... it was ranch dressing.   The gyro dinner is a far cry from award winning, dishonorable mention to say the least. I suppose my dish and I disliked each other so much that my doggy bag committed suicide atop my car, and became mere slop on the pavement.

Well... I'm not sure what happened, or what is outrageous.  Okay, the first time I visited this place... carne asada burrito was pretty tasty. The fish tacos, were... you know, fish tacos. Reasonably priced, reasonably good. Plus good drink. Good enough to make a visit #2, and bring a few people with me.   HOWEVER, visit #2... I must say, it is not reasonable to have your salivary glands dry up after a bite of fish taco, or chicken taco.   In sum... some items here are outrageously salted and give you outrageous high blood pressure.   Oh, I'll give an additional star for the availability of sriracha.

yes, carnivores galore. sometimes compromising the lives of tasty animals is necessary.  here i consumed and exceeded my recommended caloric intake, and felt robust thanks be to incredible meat feast. fried, crispy polenta paired well with the succulent meats carved to your liking-- how do you like yours? in my case, medium rare please, or perhaps something that is still pumping blood onto the plate, delightful! fat marbling where it should be, juices trickling out of meat fibers, and the most enjoyable sensation of meat disintegrating in your mouth. YEAH, pretty great. everything receives a thumbs up, with the minor exception of birthday cake surprise dessert, which was...forgettable.   anyway... iron deficiency? no more! i was quite the satiated and proud meat-eater, despite that afterwards the animals took the rest of the week to become completely digested and absorbed.

Had to make a u-turn since I missed the unassuming Bulsho. Despite that we arrived quite near the closing hour, the guys here were very accommodating.  The menu includes all your protein needs...though unfortunately due to the late arrival, goat and lamb were out of stock. Instead, our guy suggested that he would whip something up for us- if we liked it, good, if we didn't, he'd bring us something else.   We liked it... and so we were presented with more plates of these grilled meats, pita, and chappati to consume, accompanied the perfect blend of spicy, acidic, and sweet sauces. There was a point where we are all so consumed by consumption that there was this silence- we each were all concentrated in our own little feasting worlds.   For a party of three, the grand total was a mere $18. Will return, perhaps for an all day affair of breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Thumbs up Dutch Bros!   It has come to my realization that I've been frequenting this place about twice per week since the sweltering heat began.   I must say... they're stuff and they're staff is not bad. I'm a big fan of the blended Kahlua Kicker. I'm an even bigger fan when I get this drink for free, which happens as often as my visits here. You should try it.   Despite the long line that forms during the nighttime, the gregarious guy with blonde hair never forgets to entertain with a liqueur bottle trick and good conversation.   See ya!

Grubbed here for the first time just a couple days ago. Lodged in a strip mall, and distinguished by red, claw-like font, 'Bangkok' seemed like a decent place to fill the tums.  A little reluctant to enter, the blinds were open just a tad, giving us a peek in. At 7:45pm, no patrons at all-- you might have assumed they were about to close. Assumption false though, when we tried the door, and slipped right in. We were greeted by two nice guys who happily allowed us to choose any of the 30/30 vacant tables. Thanks.   The menu included all the common offerings found in most Thai places here, so I guess we played it safe by ordering the combo appetizer, combo seafood soup, pad thai, and thai bbq. Yes, a lot of food...the guy did not hesitate to remind us to "save space in your stomach"...Thanks again, guy.   Combo appetizer was...alright. And by alright, I mean, their fishcakes were out of supply and had to be replaced by chicken satay (which was, not so succulent, but whatever). Other members of the combo appetizer were eggrolls (with very crispy wrapper, but minimal filling), crab puffs, and fried tofu. All pretty "OK" appets, accompanied by the usual sauces. Pad thai was underwhelming, and add to that, anemic. BBQ was, BBQ. The only somewhat tasty thing was the combination seafood soup--tom yum goong base, with fishes of the sea, sparse distribution of shrimp, and rough cuttlefish. Coconut ice cream did not hint any coconut, but rather shaved ice with coconut flavor.   These eats, for roughly, $80. Really...80??? Yeah, that's what I keep asking myself. Most likely, will not return.

i like crispy meat patties and butter atop around surrounding the burger.    onions of the fried ring type i also like.   i don't like that did not have the fried cheese curds, so i like that i'll have to swing on by this place again to pop those curds.

despite that it was almost closing time when we arrived, and i was inhaling bleach, this diy yogurt spot is good!   served myself some yogurt of the red velvet, cake batter, and mango sorbet variety. any place that carries mochi is pretty neat, however, it would be nice if they offered more mochi selection.   will visit again!
