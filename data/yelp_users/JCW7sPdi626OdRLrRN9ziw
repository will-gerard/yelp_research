I gave it a four because everything I have tried from them was good. Not the BEST Mexican restaurant I have ever tried but definitely one I would go back to on a regular basis (especially since it's close.) I really like that they give you bean dip with your chips! They also have some great desserts.

Everything I have tried from this place is amazing! The walnut shrimp, lemon chicken... I always have a hard time deciding what to try next. My favorite Chinese food in all of the Phoenix area!!! A must try.

Maybe I just had a bad experience. I split two dishes the salmon plate and the white pizza. The pizza had a lot of crust and very little everything. The pizza in the picture on here looks much better than the pizza I received. The salmon plate was good, nothing special. Definitely wouldn't get either again. I also tried the thick pizza my mom got... It looked old and tasted that way too. I have no reason to go back except to give them another shot. They have a pretty good rating so maybe I just had a bad experience.  The salt chocolate bar was good, weird and different but good. Wouldn't get it again but good to try once. Also tried the icecream cookie. That is the only thing here I would recommend.

Love their turkey sandwiches. Not the best ever but definitely good! Great for fast food. Employees are nice and do a good job.

My favorite sub place! Their subs are great and they have these "voodoo chips" they are a mix between salt and vinegar and something else... really good. Their ice cream and ice cream sandwiches are fantastic! They use the cookies they make ( soft even when cold!) and they put several scoops of whatever ice cream you want between two cookies of your choice. One of my favorite desserts!  When you go there, that corner looks a little sketchy and so does the store but most of the time their are families in the shop.

I was surprised how good this place was. I happened to be in the area and was feeling Chinese so I decided to give it a shot. Everyone I was with loved their food and we all plan on going back. I tried their lemon chicken and chicken fried rice... Delicious! I'd recommend this place if you feel like Chinese and are in the area definitely try it.

I love Joe's BBQ! You get large portions and they give you $10 credit towards your meal on your birthday.  We used to always get the family deal, but my favorite is the baked potato loaded with meat! The mac n cheese and cheesy potatoes are definitely worth trying.

They redid the entire store. They now have a full sushi bar with amazing sushi! They also now have a wide variety of foods and brands. If you're looking for something particular that most grocery stores don't have, this place probably has it.

360 Adventures has a huge variety of things to do. Whether you live in the Phoenix area or are visiting, want an extreme adventure or a family outing you should check out their website. They offer everything from Kayaking and rock climbing to Grand Canyon tours. If you want to get out, give them a call and they will set you up with a tour you will always remember. The first tour I did with them was Canyoneering and it was an experience like no other. They even took some great pictures of me repelling off a waterfall! I loved it so much I went back to them to sign up for a hot air balloon ride (a Christmas gift for my mom.) A champagne brunch was included. I have also done the Sedona horse back riding and Sedona jeep tour. All highly recommended.

I had such an amazing time on this tour. I took my mom for her Christmas gift and it was one of the bet Christmas gifts I have ever given. The tour includes a 45-60 min hotair balloon ride then where ever you land the crew with the truck finds you and brings along your brunch. They set up tables and the champaign brunch is included. A must do while you are in the Phoenix Arizona. You get a beautiful view of the city and desert.

I was sadly disappointed with this place. I had the chicken chow mein and it had way too much teriyaki sauce. I felt crappy afterwards too. For the price I expected it to be much better. There are better Chinese restaurants in the area that are half the price and much tastier.

One of my favorite bagel places. Usually I seek out einstein bagels but this place has a lot of bagel sandwich options that most bagel places don't. Great option if you want a little bit cheaper breakfast than a brunch restaurant.

My favorite are the breakfast tacos! Everything I've tried here has been delicious. A little pricy but worth it especially every once in a while. They have a lot of grass space for kids to run around and some trees that even I want to climb... Not sure if they actually let you climb them.

Thought about giving it a four because we waited for a long time since they are not very organized with their waiting list (they don't have one) and even once we sat down it was still another hour before we got our food... However, this is by far the best Thai food in town! I can't wait to go back to try more dishes. Just don't plan on going at busy times, like Friday nights :-/

Good pizza. Everyone with me thought so too. Not the best ever, but definitely satisfies a pizza craving. I'm not a big fan of thin crust  and don't like too much crust. Their's was perfect. Price was okay, if I have the money I will definitely go again but if I'm watching my budget I'd rather go to a place that gives me an amazing pizza for that price.

Of all my travels through Ireland and Scotland this was my favorite fish and chips place! And I had a lot of fish and chips!  The fish is delicious. If you are going to Edinburgh this place is a must!  A man on my plane recommended it to me and we walked more than an hour out of our way to get there... Totally worth it!

Cheapest gas nearby. I go all the time for the 44oz drinks which are 79 cents! Great deal. However, the employees aren't always the nicest or the most helpful

If you want a lot of food then this is the place  to go. I always have leftovers. However, I ask for almost everything in my burrito bowl so it is full! If you only like meat, rice, and bean you're bowl won't be as full. Also depends on who makes your bowl. Some times I have people who are very gracious on portions and others are stingy. I have had very good luck with this particular chipotle though.  We also like to get chips with our burrito bowls... They give you very few chips in a bag. They used to give you a lot :-/ kind of a bummer.

I love this place and live nearby so I go a lot! It's a great place of you want good cheap food. I thought it was too good to be true when everything on the menu was about $5 but the Thai iced tea, potstickers, basil rice, and orange chicken are delicious. Gave it only four starts because not everything is delicious... Good... Just not delicious, but for $5 not bad. Our favorite thing to do is buy the party size potstickers... 40 for $25.

My favorite pizza in town. Decently priced but if you're looking for cheap pizza it's not for you. Definitely worth the money though!

Very good sushi and a very good price during happy hour. 2:30-6pm (mon-fri I think)  The Godzilla roll was fantastic, something I will get again.  everything we tried was very good but I think I will continue to go during happy hour.

So delicious! The four of us got different sandwiches so we could try several then we split 2 dessert sandwiches. Everything we tried was delicious! Their sandwiches are big enough to fill you up but not too big that you can't finish them. If you are really hungry I would grab a dessert sandwich to go with it. The sandwiches are small enough you won't walk out feeling like it was too much.  Fair pricing! A sandwich and drink come out to about $7 and dessert ones are less than $5. A must try if you're nearby!

Delicious Thai food! I tried the pad Thai as I always do when I first try a Thai place. It was  very tasty, it is sweeter than any of pad Thai I have ever had before and at first it was very good but about half way through it became a little too sweet. I took the other half home and had it for lunch the next day which ended up being perfect because it's too sweet to eat the entire thing in one sitting. I got it medium (mild, medium, hot, extra hot, Thai hot) which I thought might not have enough spice since I normally order a 3 out of 5 at other Thai restaurants... Nope! It was right on the border of being too hot. So be conservative when ordering on the spice.  The best part of this restaurant and the reason I gave it a 5 instead of a 4, which I think would reflect the food better, is because of the service. I have only been to one other Thai place where the staff asks you about you meal and is truly curious and has other recommendations and really wants to make sure you enjoyed your meal so you will come back. Because of the service I will be back to try more!!  Went back and tried the pumpkin curry and the basil fried rice. OMG I love pumpkin curry! A must try at this restaurant. The basil fried rice is definitely in the top 5 I have tried and I have tried a lot since that is what my boyfriend always orders.

Tried the bean cheese burrito and the quesadilla. Bean burrito was very bland, I could have made a better one with refried beans out of a can. Salsa wasn't spicy at all and my quesadilla had little cheese. The quesadilla was good but it was more like a taco than anything, even the size was of a taco. For $4.75 I expected a bigger quesadilla. They also give you a slice of lime, radish, and cucumber... Still trying to figure that out.
