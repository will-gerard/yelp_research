Way to go Cards!!! My party consisted of 25 screaming Cardinal fans.( I had made reservations 3 days prior) So, when we walked in our table was ready and our waitress was standing there to take our drink order! Every aspect of our experience was spot on!!! The Nacho's were Da Bomb! We never had to wait for anything! Here is the one downfall... there are T.V.s in the Men's  room but not the woman's... what the hell.... I jokingly complained and the management said for you it will be rectified!  Gallagher's you complete me!!  We will be back! And when College football starts again we will be turning this into a "buckeyes" bar!

When our baby Nikki recently injured herself we were panicked to say the least!  We called Sugarloaf and they said to bring her right in!   We were greeted at the door by the Vet Techs to see if they could help bring her in.  The entire staff was fantastic and very reassuring!   Dr.Rai answered all of our questions and even included our opinions in Nikki's care!  The prices were reasonable and the care was fantastic!  Nikki has a long road ahead of her but hopefully in time she will improve.(She has a herniated disc in her back)  Thank you to everyone at Sugarloaf you helped in mending my broken heart!

Clubhouse... You smell so bad~but sound soooo good!  Recently we(like sat.night)were here with 100 of our closest friends. When you walk in the smell is a little over whelming...but..you soon hear the great music and all is forgiven!   The staff was AWESOME! We had a problem with the bathroom.I told security and the dude said hey I'M a plumber and bam it was fixed!  Next.. it was a little warm so I asked if they could turn the fans on and bam they did!  The drinks are cheap. And if you like them strong then this is the place for you!  All in all Clubhouse you ROCK in every sense of the word!!!  Oh~and by the way the Horse and Hound is right next door! Cheap drinks and good food! (they also own The Clubhouse) handy huh?

This place and the people there are AWESOME!  My daughter was playing there for an open mic session on a Tuesday night... so we thought what the hell,why not!  The food was great.The service was great.And the management went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  Yes~this is a divey bar...but it is a kick ass divey bar!  (oh,and I paid for drinks all night for 10 and my bill was only 100 bucks!) AND~we drink a lot....
