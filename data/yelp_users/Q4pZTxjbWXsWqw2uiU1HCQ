Recieved a stale bagel with almost no cream cheese on it and hardly toasted. This place puts any east coast bakery to shame, or any bakery for that matter.

I got two slices of pizza with 4 toppings on each. The pizza itself was alright but when they put toppings on each slice it  was below par. It tasted like they didn't put the slices of pizza through the oven before serving it so the added toppings were not cooked and were rah. I would not recommend ordering individual slices.

I would give this a 5 star review because the Bloody Mary was by far the best looking/tasting bloody I have ever had, the blueberries on the blueberry pancakes were fresh and phenomenal, and my server Alex was very attentive to my dietary needs and as a server myself, I know how annoying that can be so I was appreciative of that.   However, the reason I did not give this place a 5 star rating is because the burrito with chorizo is by far the worst I've ever had. I do not recommend anyone to order it, ever.

DO NOT use this company. I was scammed out of money and had horrible service. I will never recommend to ever use this company. I hired them to clean my carpets 12:30-2pm then I ended up having to switch from 3pm-5pm due to last minute work responsibilities. They called me 3 times persisting to ask if they could come earlier. I would understand one phone call but 3 times in one hour is annoying and unprofessional. If I could do before 3pm I would have told them the first time they called. Then around 2:20, they called me saying they were upon arrival. I was nearly 20 minutes out, he continued to get an attitude and be rude to me for not being there at the time he was going to be there which was 40 minutes earlier than said time. After that, he continued to call me multiple times because he could not find the place and started to get very rude to me over the phone. He had my address to find the place and he insisted I give him directions( which he could not follow). By the time he got there, he went straight in and did his job which was nice. However, when he was finished, the total was $81 as billed by the company. He insisted I pay $115 due to extra charges even though the company wasn't billing me that. In fact, the receipt even says $81 that they emailed me. I was very disrespected and scammed out of my money which I do not appreciate.
