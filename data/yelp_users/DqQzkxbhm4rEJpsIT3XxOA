I was excited about trying Dunkin' Donuts for the first time during my AZ stay.   That is, until I brought an iced coffee and a dozen home for my family, and there was a spider on one of the glazed donuts. Not just chillin' there on it, but actually GLAZED ONTO it. A poor, defenseless spider frozen in time by sugary, sticky icing.   I told this particular Dunkin' Donuts, and they said they were sorry. That's it. They were sorry and they were going to pull those glazed donuts off the shelves for the rest of the day.   I didn't even like donuts that much to begin with, but I'll probably never eat one again.   Wow. Thank you so much, DD!

I am ashamed...ashamed to say I had the best carne asada fries last weekend, and it was NOT in San Diego.   There are a lot of taco shops in Chandler. Apparently, word is they are not very good, except for Los Favoritos. I scoffed. My San-Diego-friends-now-residing-in-AZ kept trying to convince me how good it was. I scoffed again. HA! Finally, I decided to go, just to compare. What a snob.  Looks like every other taco shop I've been to, maybe a little cleaner. Carne Asada fries is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. I opened up that styrofoam box, and it was pretty. No, really. I haven't had carne asada fries that good...ever...so far...  Recommendations: Chicken rolled tacos, quesadilla, pretty much carne asada anything.

My cousins and I saw the sign for this place while driving, and it boasted 350 flavors of tabacco. What the hell? That's crazy-talk.  We stopped by, I'm pretty sure all of the employees were Native American. Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure this is the border of a reservation, since the Casino was a stone's throw away. Plus, ya know, the name of the place.   We were carded right away, because apparently this 26 yr old looks 17.   The place was packed! And, there's a drive-thru!  There really are 350 different flavors of tobacco here. I didn't count, but I'm almost sure of it. My friend bought some flavored cigars, because it said Al Capone smoked them on the box. They have cool lighters too.   Maybe I was just in awe because I don't see shops like this in San Diego. What a tourist.

It's your average strip club. I went here for my cousin's birthday party (a lady), and stayed for a couple hours before heading home. It wasn't extravagant or hellacious or highly entertaining. It was pretty normal.   I was surprised at how attractive a lot of these girls are. I was expecting mediocre looks, but they're actually pretty.   The DJ plays a range of music from different genres, the bartenders were pretty much on par, and the waitresses are talented in the way they weave through the crowd, careful not to get knocked in the head by a stripper's 9 inch shoe while in the midst of giving a lap dance.   I do dig the double poles, but wary of the fact that they hardly ever wiped them down in-between each stripper's turn. Oh well, I'm not the one dancing up there.

You'll never need a refill, because the drinks are huge. The deep dish pizza is okay (I had the spinach pie), but I think I like Uno's Chicago crust better for it's buttery flakiness(gasp!) They do give you a choice of whole wheat crust (which I got) or regular white crust. If you're gonna get a salad with your pizza, be aware that the salads are ginormous, so it might be a little hard eating a pizza as well (Or, I just suck because my stomach just can't take it like it should.) There's lots of sports memorabilia and games, so that's kinda cool Their house dressing rocks, but I can't really decipher what is in it, or even describe why it's good. It's just good. I really just wanted to write a review with no breaks. Thanks.

1st: It's a Boston pride sports bar/grill/restaurant type place. Everything you want to know about Boston is hanging on the walls and playing on their TV's. I actually thought it was pretty cool.   2nd: The music they were playing was completely random, and sucky. I was trying to pinpoint the genre. I think I even said out loud, "Are the artists they're playing all from Boston, because I'm not getting this music??" It was mostly mid 90's alternative/contemporary. Not that cool for a sports bar, even though I knew every song that came on, but I'm not normal.   3rd: Nobody liked their food at my table, including me, and I rarely complain about pizza. Even bad pizza is okay pizza, but it really wasn't that great. Little Caesar's? I dunno.   4th: They do have great Happy Hour specials 7 days a week, 1/2 priced drinks and 5 dollar appetizers, and they've got that trivia night thing going for them.   5th: I hate it when the server automatically assumes a guy is paying for the meal, and gives the check to one of the guys at a table. I'm not some liberal-feminist-type, but yes, some girls do pay for meals out.

Sonic. Never had it until I went to AZ.   So..they have everything. Burgers, sandwiches, wraps, coneys (what?), salads, smoothies, breakfast items, a billion sides, desserts, and numerous beverage choices.  Everyone raves about the tater tots, so I ordered them. Yeah, they were....tater tots....a lot of...tater tots. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but....they were tater tots.  I think the Cherry Limeade is where it's at. I'm a sucker for the little marachino cherries in my beverages. Reminds me of "kiddie cocktails." The peach tea is also delicious, as is the slushes.  There's one thing I didn't understand about this place: They sell bags of ice through the drive-thru. Now, someone help me out....Is that standard for all Sonics? Or, is it because it's Arizona and it's 19,000 degrees? Just curious.

Uh, one of my favorite coffee shops I've ever been to.   Free Wifi. Word.   Delicious breakfast pastries. Word.   Customized coffee blends that set you on FIRE! WORD!  Friendly and knowledgeable staff that are way more cool than they are annoying. Word up.   I just found out that I like marshmallow syrup. Uh, word? Word.

My friends raved about Hungry Howie's Pizza, because they have flavored crust. Ranch, cheese, butter cheese (huh?), garlic, and maybe some other flavors that I'm forgetting but too lazy to find out about.   I don't usually eat my crust. It's just one of those things, so I figured if I could eat my pizza crust here, then I would give it a high rating.   I've heard about Hungry Howie's, but have never eaten it, because apparently the closest location is in Santee, and I don't venture to the Santee area on a normal basis. Like, ever. So, we ordered 3 pizzas, 3 flavored crusts: Ranch, Garlic, and Cheese.   Ranch crust = salty as all hell. I ate one of my pizza crusts, but drank half of my bottle of water afterwards.   Cheese crust = fine. Nothing awesome about it.   Garlic crust = deliciousness.   I would say the actual pizza is equivalent to Round Table. Which, is not a bad thing at all.   I would also say that....I would order pizza from here again....If there was a location even remotely close to me in CA. Wait, I won't be living in CA anymore, so maybe I still have a chance.

Cracker Barrel = Southern staple, right? I'm pretty sure I heard Oprah say that once.   Part country store-part restaurant, they definitely have cool things to buy. Or, rather, stuff that you would get, say, in a magazine that you would order around Christmastime or if some kid was selling stuff for school.  They sell rocking chairs for about 130 bucks apiece. But, they're really well-made, and if I had enough room in my car, I would have bought one and taken it home.   I don't usually tell my server that I don't eat meat when I go out. During this visit to Cracker Barrel, however, my friend blurted it out when I was trying to decide between salad and pancakes. In light of this, my waitress was extremely helpful in trying to find me a dish to eat that would be satisfying enough to keep me full for the 5.5 hour drive home. She even went as far as taking my menu and drawing stars next to all the items I could eat. Totally unnecessary, but really sweet.   Hashbrown casserole + homemade biscuits = heavenly deliciousness. And, affordable too!!!
