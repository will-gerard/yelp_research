Stopped into Garage Wine & Tap, previously really enjoyed this place for happy hour. Not so much this visit... They were out of the deviled eggs... This is one of the appetizers they are known for... So how can you be out of something you can buy across the street.., we opted for the Lamb skewers unfortunately they were so tough no amount of chewing could get them down... Though our server was aware she did not take them off the bill. The humus was mediocre at best and the wings which use to be awesome were served mildly warm and we had to request celery and blue cheese.. Which took forever to be served... Not impressed.... Management really needs to step it up,.. Could be a great neighborhood go to place but not for this neighbor!

Stopped into this cute little place to purchase a pie to share at Thanksgiving. Though there was only one other couple in the place the energy was chaotic...now granted they were cranking out a lot of holiday pies but the girl at the counter did not even know the types of pies in case and seemed pretty clueless. Since they were out of many pies on the day I stopped by I was told that if I returned at 7:00 AM the next morning ( today) they would have extra pies that did not have to be pre- ordered. My husband headed down there today stood outside the door and was greeted at 7:05 by another clueless employee who had no idea what was going on but said that if you did not pre- order there were no pies available. My hubby was not too happy needless to say. Need to get it together and make sure all of your employees are on the same page and educated in your product!
