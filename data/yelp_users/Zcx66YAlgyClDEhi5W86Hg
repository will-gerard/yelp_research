Just didn't feel like making dinner tonite, and wanted something quick, yummy and good for me.  I noticed Zoes on my drive home and decided to stop in and check it out. The food was pretty good! I got the grilled chicken platter with a side of rice. I left feeling full (but like the good kind, not the "on my God I'm gonna pass out" kind ;) and satisfied!  I gave it 2 stars because it is kinda generic and there are so many hidden gems to keep an eye out for.  :) Enjoy!

I love Cheuvront. The atmosphere is great, the staff is awesome, always super friendly and accommodating. These guys know their stuff! I have never had a bad experience and would recommend it to anybody (already have!) The events they have are also really great, I would highly recommend you make some time to check one of them out.

I love love this place. I am a total chicken when it comes to my hair (fine and curly) and have had the same exact hair cut for years. I finally decided that I needed a change, a BIG change. So I picked Ide because of the reviews I read on here and figured why not!  Miranda was my stylist. I went from shoulder length hair to an awesome chopped bob! Miranda listened to my regular style routine and gave me a haircut that works both when I am in a hurry and also can look super glam when I have a little more time to style it.  The atmosphere in the salon is great, the customers were very cool, and the staff was very friendly and social.  I am IN LOVE with my new hair cut, and Ide Mania!   In fact, I will be going back soon for a trim and highlights!

Okay I just need to say that this truly is the best place ever. I love Miranda, she is magic with those scissors. The women who work there are all SOOOO sweet and helpful. I am Super picky and have fine curly hair and am always terrified when its time to get a cut because I'm afraid its gonna turn out bad (and gluing my hair back on isn't an option) but I am NEVER disappointed. Thank you Miranda and all the IDE staff! You guys rock!

Pretty fun breakfast with my fav's. Alas I could only give it 2 stars because it didn't knock my socks off. Our server seemed nice enough, but definatly not going for any server of the month awards. If it's your cheat day, def try the cinnamon roll. You WILL LOVE IT..You're waistline, not so much (but that's why we have cheat days :D  Overall it was good, nothing special, kind of your standard breakfast joint.  Will I be back? Sure, if I there isn't a new and fun place to discover :)

Got both my tragus pierced by Anna, super friendly, super smart and lovely person. It took 2 seconds and 3 days later I'm almost fully back to normal.   Highly recommend going to get pierced here, also, they have gorgeous body jewelry.

Came here to get pizza to go & while I waited had some wine and the cheese platter. The platter was massive and well presented however the cheeses were boring. The service was disappointing, the girls were very nice but didn't really know how to manage their time so I spent a lot of time waiting for my server.. Anyway I got my pizza and walked home, I opened the box to discover a good looking pie, which made me smile but when I went to grab a slice, I noticed my server didn't bother to slice it properly or even at all (even though I saw her slicing other pizzas!)  Luckily, I do have a pizza cutter so it worked out. The pizza was good, crispy crust, light toppings.   All in all it was not what I expected. Give it a try, but I won't be going back.  Happy New Year my darlings !

I really do love this place. It's got a sophistication and sexy chilled out feel that no place else has quite been able to replicate. Their wine selection is phenomenal and if your hungry you NEED to try the Stetson Chop.   You can really see how this place is ran by pro's. It always feels so effortless being there and it truly is a delight.  Happy sipping :)

Two words. Stetson Chop! Believe the hype, you HAVE to try this thing. Such random ingredients but the combination is so good it's almost sinful. I kind of cheat though and head on to Kazimierz and get the SC there just because I am in love with the atmosphere :)

Every time I've been here the food has been excellent! Whenever family comes into town and we can't think of a place to go Kyoto always comes up because it never disappoints! The entrées are a decent portion, we always split them cause unless you're starving you won't be able to finish it on your own. I do have to say though that every time we've gone we've only ever done the teppanyaki so I don't know what their bento is like but I can't imagine it being bad. Def go with a cool group and enjoy the show!

Let me start by saying I had heard of Bianco for the longest time and the infamous wait, so I never quite made it out because I thought...It's Pizza !!! But when my mom flew in and insisted on Bianco I thought, what the heck so we made a day of it, we got there and put our names on the list, went next door and got a bottle of wine, the wait was long but I had great company and awesome wine....when we got called and walked in and the smell of the resturant was so overwhelming, I was almost scared that the food was gonna disappoint for sure because nothing could top those delicious aroma's in the air....then the pizza's arrived!!!! HOLY COW!!!! I got the ROSA and it WAS worth the wait..in all honesty its unlike anything I have ever tasted!  Will I go back...Absolutely!  My advice is, do not go if you are in a hurry, you have to make a day of it, enjoy the wait by going with awesome people, have some wine and be ready for the best pizza you have ever tasted!  For those people who freak out about spending money on wine and what not, you're probably right..you SHOULD goto Costco, this place isn't for you..Bianco, and places like it are for people with a true appreciation for culinary experiences and not impatient people who wouldn't know the difference if you served them a Bordeaux Chateau Lafite or some Franzia.

Okay so here is the deal with Stingray..Is it the best sushi, no, but the location (old town) is great and pretty convenient. I love to be adventurous with food, especially sushi, but the times where I want something I know I'm going to like, this is the spot. The service is always good, and so is the food. You have to try their Shrimp Shumai. You're welcome ;)

I love Trader Vics! I have been to several locations and it is ALWAYS a great time. The atmosphere is great, the drinks superb and the food spectacular! Their happy hour can't be beat and their outdoor seating area is super sexy.  Service is always friendly and the crowd is pretty cool.  Great place for dinner or just some cocktails! So put on your heels ladies..its Tiki time :)  Enjoy! XOXO

As much as I enjoy the cute and fancy pants places in Scottsdale, when you want REALLY delicious sushi, without the crowd this is the place for you. The staff is super friendly, the prices are reasonable and again, the sushi is great!

I don't love Geisha but I don't hate it either. The sushi is good, the drinks are what we go for mostly and the atmosphere is pretty nice, not my favorite place in old town but if you have never been it's worth stopping in.

When I heard people talk this place up I'm like dude pasta is pasta, what is the big deal? Then I got there and checked the menu out, I thought it was creative but kind of limited. The bread sticks in that silly wraper thing annoyed me. Then the food came out.... Holy monkies Batman! I don't quite know what they're putting in this pasta but it is divine! No joke. Each time I've gone back and tried something new I've never been disappointed. If you want seriously delicious and unique pasta. Get ur toshie to pasta bar... Oh and the olive appetitzer?!?! I didn't know olives could taste like that. I'm a huge fan!!!!

Stopped in for the first time with my sister and her hubby who were visiting from out of town, and after a day of shopping this seemed like a good spot to get some lunch. I have to say the inside is pretty impressive, very sexy décor, I dig it. The napkins kinda weirded me out, mostly cause the dang thing shed all over my black pants, but whatev, no biggie.  I had the seared tuna salad with wasabi peas, and LOVED IT. Sis had the shrimp Caesar and said it was great, and hubby had the shaved prime rib sandwich, which he enjoyed thoroughly!  All in all good experience, will definitely be back. Seems like it would be a great place for happy hour or evening cocktails with the ladies before a night out !

This place just opened up. The layout is pretty dope and the hookah is some good quality stuff. I will def be a regular, it's hard finding good hookah places in old town. Their VIP room is real nice. I hope they start serving food cause that would make it perfect!!!

I really hate to give a bad review but I was so pissed off after leaving this place I just want to warn anyone who will listen. STAY AWAY!  So first off I explain what I want done and the guy is not paying attention, instead he's talkig to his coworker... I let it go, I figured he's got it. NO! He filed my nails down to the point where hey started to hurt and whenever I would say ouch, he would stop and look at me like I was crazy... To top it off after hurting me repeatidly my nails were terrible. My index fingernail was slanted to the left, it was horrible. I had to go home and make them super short and paint them so they would look decent and then after 3 days they began to lift!!!  I swear to God I had half a mind to be like F off I'm not paying you. But I didn't. (kickig myself 4 it now)  Seriously guys stay away. Goto 101 Nails on Shea instead or any other place for that matter.  Rude people Bad service Crappy attitudes Can't seem to even glue the tips on straight!!  This place is a joke!  Fail!!!
