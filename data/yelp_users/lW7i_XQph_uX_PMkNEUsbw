It is a little expensive, but they do offer certain deals. I always have a pleasant  time and find the creative process somewhat therapeutic. The staff is always very helpful and friendly. Fun place for alone creative time or for a family or group outing.

The positives are that the service is great. We were seated quickly and our server was very friendly and helpful. Now the negatives...I feel like the menu options are very limited and the prices are too high for the type of food they serve. I find it strange that they do things like serve a dish with two grains and no vegetables, that they will exchange fries for a salad without telling you that it costs extra, that they only cook burgers rare or well, and that they only serve VERY large salads and no longer offer smaller portions. I used to be a huge Applebee's fan, but I do not like the changes that they have made in recent years. I won't be back...sorry guys.

Soooo....no free vacuums after I pay $5 for a car wash? "Meh. I've experienced better." just about sums it up.

This place is a landmark in Mesa. I think Mesa Fro Yo has been here longer than I have been alive. It isn't super fancy, and there isn't a ton of variety like some places; but there flavors are so yummy and unique. The prices are reasonable and you definitely get your monies worth here! Another great thing is that they have other things besides yogurt; so if you are looking for a little snack or something they have things like soft pretzels, rootbeer floats, and smoothies.

I think that $13.24 is FAR too much to pay for an adult and a small child to bowl one game; however, my little one was excited so I paid the price. Then, we had repeated trouble with the ball return and our lane (number 27) obviously had some serious flaws or warping. We've used the "granny bowler" for my toddler before and it worked great and he got to hit a few pins. This time however, once the ball got 3/4 down the lane it would suddenly turn and he never got to hit any. There was clear disappointment on his face.  I've been visiting different AMF alleys since I was very young and they have seriously let things go. The prices are too high, the place feels dirty, the equipment frequently malfunctions, AND one of the lanes is obviously warped. It may be a VERY long time before we consider bowling at AMF again. So sad, I used to have such a good time at these lanes. :(

I love this place!!! The staff is always very kind and helpful, the food is fresh, and I love the options and flavors they have. The way they price for children is PERFECT (.55 for year year of age) Also, you can't beat that you also get soup, rice, a drink and ice cream with your dinner.

My favorite buffet! Plenty of healthy and delicious options. Everything is fresh and the best part is that there is something for everyone, not just soup and salad.

Their lunch is pretty good, but If you want a really great cookie or cinnamon role THIS IS THE PLACE. Sweet Cakes and Cinnabon are tied for the best cinnamon role I've ever had.

My husband and I visited Zur Kate to try something new for my birthday and it was a very pleasant experience. The atmosphere was very cozy and fun. It made us feel like we might actually be visiting a little place in Germany. The waitress was very kind and helpful and the food was good. My favorite part though was the apple strudel! It was delicious.

I had a great experience at this Sbarros! The food was good, our order was ready quickly, and the guy who helped us was very nice and very helpful. I didn't expect such great service at a pizza place in a mall, but I will visit them again for sure.

I've tried many other automated car washes and, in my opinion, this is definitely one of the better ones. If I want a quick, inexpensive, and decent automated wash I use this place. I also like that they have free vacuums and they never have a very long wait.

My family and I go to Genghis Grill a couple of times a year and we always have a good experience. The service is good, the food is fresh and delicious, and I love that you can customize your meal to make it as healthy or delicious ;) as you like. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that: 1. It is kind of pricey in my opinion,  2. The kids menu is just sad, and  3. they got rid of my favorite citrus sauce BOOHOO :(  Other than that it's a great place.

My entire family and I love this place! The food and service is always good. We love the free pizza on our birthdays and I am IN LOVE with their Kale Chopped Salad (and I'm not even a big kale fan). Thank you for always being a great place to have a fun dinner with family and friends!

My husband and I wend to Fogo for our anniversary and we both loved this place! My favorites were the crispy polenta, lamb chops, and lombo. I also loved the farmers market table, the variety is amazing and it is very fresh! Go with a big appetite as it is difficult not to try everything. This is hands down the best restaurant we have ever been to. The servers are wonderful, the food is delightful, and the atmosphere is elegant and comfortable. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because of the prices. As good as everything was; it is, in my opinion, CRAZY EXPENSIVE. I wish we could afford to visit Fogo de Chao again.

I went to this Big O because they had a really great coupon for a $17 oil change plus 40 point inspection. Positives are: They are very nice, the face to face service is good, and the wait wasn't too long. Now...Here comes the negative part. When I arrived everything on my car was working fine. When I left my AC's valve cap was missing, my AC was out of freon, AND my tires were not aligned properly which made my steering wheel shake terribly on the freeway. I'm sure that they did not do anything on purpose; but I do think there was a degree of negligence in there work when they checked out my car. I will not be returning.

I seriously love this place! They are super friendly, have excellent service, and the food is always delicious. I also love that it is nice enough of a place for a date with the hubby, but they also offer carry out. We always get the buffet because everything is awesome, but my favorites are the chicken tikka masala, the naan, and the gulab jamun. Weather you're already a lover of Indian food or you've never tried it, visit India Oven and you won't be sorry.

The restaurant is small and the atmosphere is nice and has a Thai feel to it. The service is fantastic. The prices are good and the portions are quite large. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Everyone loved what they ordered. It's a great place for a couple of friends or a small group to have a delicious and fresh meal. I ordered the Green Curry and it was delicious; as were the spring rolls, pot stickers and pineapple fried rice. We will surely be visiting this little Thai bistro again.

I'm not a huge soup, salad, sandwich lover. Normally, I find these lunch places way over priced. In the case of Zupas, however, I feel that the price matches the quality and quantity of the food you get. I had the Wisconsin cauliflower soup and a Turkey spinach artichoke sandwich. Both were wonderful.

One of the last true thrift stores (none of this high priced Goodwill nonsense). Their prices are really great, they are constantly getting in new stuff, and they have a great variety. The store is well organized and feels as clean as a thrift store can. I also have to give a shout out to their staff; they are always so helpful and friendly if I need help with something or have a question. I love shopping at 360.

I have used Cool Cuts for my kiddos hair cuts for a few years now. They almost always do a great job and I feel that the price is reasonable. It helps my little one feel more comfortable getting his hair cut when there are movies to watch and fun little cars to sit in. Also, the staff are always very nice and work well with children.

I love this salon! All the girls there are great I'm sure, but Allison does an amazing job and cuts my hair exactly as I describe it to her. The ambiance inside the salon is really nice, clean and modern. I only had to wait a minute or two for my appointment to begin and I feel that the price is worth the great service and beautiful work. Great place, I will certainly be a regular.

Gunnell's is great for so many reasons, but my recent experience with them takes the cake. My young family and I were taking out first trip to Disneyland and we were running behind and already frustrated. We got on the freeway and my steering wheel began to shake, A LOT. Luckily, this Gunnell's wasn't far and we took my car into their shop. The front desk girl and mechanic I talked to were so kind when I explained the situation. The mechanic was able to look at my car, realign the wheels or whatever, and get us on our way in under an hour. I have only ever has great experiences with both this Gunnell's and the on on Mckellips and Gilbert. Good, honest service every time. Thank you!        After taking my car to another place to have the oil changed because of a coupon ($17 for oil change and 40 point inspection, hard to ignore for me), there was several things wrong with my car and this tire problem was one of them. Needless to say, I will never take my car to that other place ever again.

I LOVE this place. The building isn't super nice, but don't let that throw you. They have a TON of great stuff that I can't find anywhere else (unless I want to drive to Phoenix, and let's face it no one wants to do that, haha). Their prices are perfectly reasonable and I can't begin to tell you how friendly and helpful the staff is. Sometimes I go to this store just too look at everything because there are just so many great things in there. They also offer classes, cake pan rental, and cake pedestal rental. What more could a small business baker ask for? Love them!
