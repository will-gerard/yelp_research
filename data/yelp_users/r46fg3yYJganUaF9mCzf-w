We went here after finding a coupon on groupon.com.  The service was good and friendly and the restaurant was quaint.  It definitely has the neighborhood bistro feel.  The food... not so good.  We ordered the special appetizer with shrimp, tomatoes, and garlic bread.  The garlic bread was stale.  I ordered the Chicken Toscano, which sounded yummy with with artichokes, prosciutto and Mozzarella.  It tasted like Chicken soaked in butter with ham.  The prosciutto was probably the worst quality I have ever experienced.  My boyfriend ordered Sergio's Ravioli and I would say for $14 we could have gotten Costco's frozen pasta to last us a week and it tastes much better!

Nice chairs, clean, and great service.  They gave me a gossip magazine and water right away - perfect way to start a mani/pedi.  They didn't continuously try to up sell me with $5 add-ons.  She did suggest that I get the "Sugar Daddy" color for my nails... hmmm  Great place! I'll go back here.

Great place to frequent.  The owners, Paul and Sue, take pride in their restaurant and it shows by their active involvement day to day.  Overall their sushi is good quality.  If you want them to make something up for you they certainly will do so.  If you dine at Sushi Eye enough you'll get your own chopsticks so you feel special - nice touch :-)

This place is trendy but not over the top.  The red sangria was worth it.  Their bruschetta was so so.  Two of us enjoyed the boca trio pizza and had enough for left-overs (eating them now!)

I'm not sure why I've been to this restaurant more than once.  My last experience is how I decided to give it a 2-star, maybe I would have given them a 3-star based on prior visits. (At first I was tempted to give it a 1-star but I reserve that rating for visible creepy crawlers, etc.)  630 - We arrive to make sure we are in time for Happy Hour.  645 - Our order was taken  653 - Edamame and salad arrive (no utensils, napkins, water or beer).  The lower into the bowl of Edamame we get, the less fresh they taste.  655 - Napkins and utensils arrive.  We ask about our beer and water (it's Happy Hour, remember?!) 658 - Water arrives, Happy Hour is over so they take away the menu. 702 - Beer arrives (Where are their priorities?)  Then sushi arrives and it's mediocre or even worse than mediocre.  Maybe I should say, you get what you pay for?  Definitely not going back here.

We went here on a Friday night and waited about 40 minutes, which I didn't think was bad at all.  On the other hand, once we got our table we waited at least another 20 minutes before we were greeted by our server.  I had to finally call out to someone and ask them if we had a server.  Turns out they had a mix-up with the tables since they had a big party.  The manager immediately apologized and offered a round of drinks.  Once a server was assigned the service was good and the food was delicious.  At the end of the night the manager comped our entire meal... a big indicator to me that he didn't want a bad Yelp review :-)    Overall, I would recommend Culinary Dropout to a friend.

Horrible happy hour martinis - unless you like pure sugar syrup. Food is not much better. Would not recommend it.

Mediocre service.  Food was not good and overpriced.  Someone else said it, "the tacos couldn't have been much larger than a silver dollar for $2.99 each."   I would add that the carne asada tasted like ground beef and the margaritas were more water than flavor. I wouldn't recommend this place.
