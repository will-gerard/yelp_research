The Wii Fit is fun way to workout but realized thanks to my daughter that its not a "real" work out.  So to avoid further harassment from my daughter we decided to look into joining a gym about a month ago.  After doing some research the YMCA seemed to be the best fit for us.  We joined as a family about a month ago and so far I am really enjoying the YMCA in Scottsdale.  If you are looking for a well maintained gym that has a pool, tons of classes, and a day care (at no additional cost with the family plan) and not full of muscle heads this is the place for you.    I have taken about 10 spin classes so far and Lisa is a great instructor at 5:30am so definitely recommend giving her class a try if you can get your butt up early enough.  Every time I have gone my day has seemed to be more productive.  For those (and I am one of them) that need extra motivation to work out the YMCA uses a progress logging system called Fitlinx.  You can sign up for a free intro to the machines that are part of this system.  Each time you visit the gym you log in and those circuit or cardio machines (and there are many) that are tied into the Fitlinx system it will record your progress.  The YMCA even reports weekly progress of top members so for those competitive folks this is the perfect incentive to getting off the couch and into the gym.  I know its working for me as I don't like seeing my name so far down the list.  For the price the YMCA is definitely worth checking out if you are considering joining a gym.

If you live in the Shea / Scottsdale area definitely check out YMCA Scottsdale. Well maintained location, classes such as spin, etc. are at convenient times. Been there many different times of the day and have never seen it too busy. Also very affordable and the family plan includes childcare in a good size room for the kids to play in while you are working out.

Grew up back East NY/NJ area so I am fine with being a Pizza Snob.  Have to say that Ray's Pizza is one of my favorite Pizza's in Phoenix Area.  Giving it a 4 star because the mushroom pizza is not very good.  Mushrooms taste like can mushrooms.  Other than that everything else is fantastic.  Tastes like home.

After a long week, taking the family to dinner Friday nights at Los Olivos is quite the treat for all.  The highlights for us are the relaxing atmosphere, good Mexican food, attentive service, cold Negro Modelo beers and talented mariachis playing music.  My kids would be happy just eating their awesome chips and salsa.  We all love to get the tortilla soup and share that as a starter.  For the adults our favorites are the Huevos Rancheros and Chorizo Con Huevos.  The kids love the bean burritos and cheese quesadillas.    Would have given it a 5 star except last time really did not care for the tough to eat carne asada (way too thin and overcooked) nor the margaritas (way too sour).  If looking for a good Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that won't break the bank give Los Olivos a try.

Looking for a change from the Chili's type restaurants - then check out Red Robin. My kids love the menu options for them such as pasta, chicken fingers, etc. and I can always find a healthier option for myself such as the grilled chicken and salad, etc. that are very tasty. My friends love the burgers as they have many different kinds and a good seasoning. I tried the burger one time without the bun as I've been avoiding grains and it was very good.  Food comes out quickly, the servers are very nice, all in all its what you would hope for at a convenient, inexpensive quick dining experience.

Had a great dinner this past week at Don & Charlie's and actually got to meet one of the owners. So cool.  Anyways, the food was really good. My favorite was the chopped liver appetizer (only regret is I ate it so fast and wanted more - it was that GOOD) and the filet mignon I had for dinner. The Caesar salad had a little too much dressing on it so next time will ask for a little lighter but nothing near drowning in dressing worthy of being sent back.  The atmosphere is really comfortable and not like a stuffy steakhouse I have seen at other higher end locations.  Lots of cool sports memorabilia on the walls. If in the downtown Scottsdale area and craving good steak, ribs, etc. Definitely check out Don & Charlie's. You won't be disappointed.

Been going to Toyama's for over 5 years now and definitely my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona.  If you are on a date night without the kids definitely sit at the bar by Mo (owner).  We have gotton to know Mo well and love walking in and he remembers our name and always says hello.  Japanese version of Cheers Bar.  We usually just ask him to surprise us with what he recommends and have not yet been disappointed.  Not only does the sushi presentation always look amazing the flavor and quality is top notch.  The whitefish carpaccio is amazing and so is the seabass and halibut sashimi.

Love this place but giving it a 4 star as it can be somewhat slow and few healthier options to select from. Yeah I know, penalizing them for not "healthy" is probably silly as you know when going to let's say a fast food joint you are not eating so good. That being said the food at Defalco's is very high quality - almost as if you are in Italy and am not comparing it to fast food.  I suggest you wait to try out Defalco's when not in a rush as its worth the wait. There order system is very similar to local places back east (basically avoiding technology) and that probably ties into part of the slower process of ordering and getting your food. I am from back east (NY area) and finding a good Italian deli / grocery store in the Phoenix area is not an easy task. A friend introduced me to Defalco's and anytime I am headed south on Scottsdale road (which is often) and after passing Thomas my stomach seems to pick up we are near Defalco's as it starts giving me the rumble noise.  I have tried many things on the menu such as Eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken Parmigiana, and Cheese steak and three of those are worth a shot. I recommend to bring a friend and each get a different large sandwich and share.

Slices Pizza is pretty good, not the best though. But if you are on Mill Ave its the best Pizza option.  Uno's is around the corner and probably the worst pizza in Phoenix.  If the main guy that works there was not so rude probably would have given it 3 stars.  If you are in Tempe a much better Pizza place is Red Devil Pizza about 5 minutes South.

Work on Mill Avenue so visit Uno's about 1x/week as its really close to my office.  The manager Jay is really a great guy so makes visiting their often a good experience. It's a pizza place so I am giving Uno's only 3 stars because their pizza is horrible.  I stick with their soup and salad lunch special and that is good.  I really like the clam chowder soup.  The rattlesnake pasta is also pretty good. I am from back east so maybe a Pizza Snob but if I wanted cardboard pizza I would order Domino's and save a few $$$,  Wow just saw this review of best and worst Pizza's to eat.  Check it out at http://health.yahoo.com/experts/eatthis/36451/the-best-and-worst-pizzas-in-america/ and Wow the Uno Chicago Grill Chicago Classic Deep Dish Individual Pizza is 2,310 calories and 165g fat.  Oh my.  Guess I won't be ordering that again.

Not sure if the heat we were feeling at breakfast was due to the near 100 degree weather at 9am or the spicy Huevos Rancheros from very unique El Encanto Mexican restaurant.  Yes its hot out but that shouldn't stop you from heading up to Cave Creek and giving this restaurant a try. For those not brave enough (or smarter than I am) to handle the AZ heat (especially during the summer months) you can sit inside. If you do dine inside, make sure, especially if you have kids, to get a window seat by the pond to see the ducks, turtles, occasional fish and on our last visit an owl.  We decided to sit outside as we got there early enough before it starting getting too hot outside (misters were on so that made it very comfortable) and enjoyed the live music on the patio. The rustic Mexican furniture fits the theme perfectly with Mexican blankets as seat cushions. The guitar player was really good and my 2 daughters definitely enjoyed the entertainment.  Until 11am on Sundays (not sure if this is always the case so make sure you give them a call before you head in) they have a great brunch to try out some of their menu items. I don't believe you can order off the normal menu during brunch but many of their top items are available during brunch so you should be happy either way. The Pollo Fundido is awesome as well as the Huevos Rancheros.  Everything we have tried so far has been delicious.  Can you tell I am a fan?    As my 5 year old daughter who is a big fan of Mexican food likes to say after she finishes up her breakfast and gets to feed the ducks, "this is the best place eveeeeer!"  If you are up for a fun experience and great Mexican food give El Encanto a try. You won't be disappointed.

If you are not into loud noise and sports definitely not your place but if you are in the mood for great wings (especially the boneless options) Buffalo Wild Wings is an awesome choice.  Today we felt a little crazy so upped our heat on the wings and went for the habernaro mango boneless wings.  They were quite good.    So far very few wing flavors we have tried have been bad.  The waitress was impressed we did not think the habernaro wings were hot so dared us to try the blazing hot sauce.  Up for the challenge she brought us out some and dipped the medium wing into it.  Was definitely hot and I probably could not eat more than 1 but next time we are going to give those a shot.  The asian zing wings are awesome and the $3.25 large beer special today was a nice side.

Saturday morning woke up and family was craving good breakfast.  Being a little rough around the edges from a few too many cocktails Friday night decided to play it safe and go out for breakfast rather than cooking.  My youngest daughter wanted Butterfields (as she pronounces it BetterFelds but she's 3 so give her a break) so we headed over.  Got there about 9:30am and packed outside but didn't feel like going somewhere else.  They turn the tables really fast so only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Everything was delicious (as usual).  Definitely get a fresh squeezed OJ and try the pancakes.  If you are up for the 20-30 minute wait on the weekends  the food is awesome.

I am not the greatest golfer but really do enjoy getting outside and playing a round.  The refreshment cart ladies definitely help my game out as I found the more often I got a beer from her the better my game got.    Anyway,  I have been wanting to try out Wildfire Golf Club for a while but always a little more than I wanted to spend.  Since I am still quite bad I like to try and keep my fees in the under $100 range.  We noticed a good deal for Wildfire (normaly $150 per person) this past weekend at $100/person and gave it a shot.  Beautiful course and not extremely hard. Long fairways that are well maintained.  The GPS on the cart was my 1st time seeing that and it was extremely helpful and something I will definitely want to try out again.  It showed not only our cart where we were on the course, distance, etc. but also if other carts are still in play which was helpful on a few holes that were not perfectly straight and knowing where the other cart was around the bend.

For years I've been wanting a road bike and being the Internet nerd I spent most of my time online doing research.  As with car shopping decided to then hit some local bike shops to test some out and get some help.  Unfortunately I did not find a shop that worked out for me until my close friend introduced me to Bicycle Haus in downtown Scottsdale.  These guys are the real deal and Brock took great care of me.  Got me set up with an awesome Specialized Tarmac bike and all the essential gear and tips to get me on the road. I had a zillion questions and the team was really patient with me.  Had an issue with my right clip not working well and brought it back to Bicycle Haus and they took care of fixing it while I waited. If you looking for expertise and highest quality bike and or gear definitely check out Bicycle Haus.

I've been having Sam cut my hair since 2002 when he was at a former barber shop and moved over to Goodfellas.  Such a great guy and really gets you in a good mood when you are there.  You will feel like a million bucks after leaving.  The barbers are a great bunch of guys.  Sam is not in every day so I usually just walk in and have the next available barber cut my hair.  So far I have not had a bad haircut yet.  Definitely a little on the pricey side which is the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star.    Other than that the experience is great and worth the extra few dollars for a haircut.  Being able to watch TV (each seat has a personal TV) is a nice touch during your haircut.  If you are up for a shave that is quite the interesting experience and something every guy needs to try out 1 time in his life.  Definitely go and check out Goodfellas next time you need a haircut.  You won't be sorry and the little massage hand machine they finish you off with at the end is quite nice.

Delicious!!!  Between my family of 4 we have probably tried most of the menu items at Sauce.  My daughters (5 yrs and 3 yrs) love the pizza and pasta with meatballs.  I hope Sauce comes out with more specials like the Summer Deal - $20 for pizza, salad and wine.  My favorite items so far are the Meatball Sandwich and the Chicken and Broccoli and cheese sauce.  I need to find out where Sauce gets the side pepper that comes with the Meatball Sandwich.  If you like peppers ask for an extra one as the peppers are really good (not spicy but sweet).  Can you tell I am a HUGE fan of Sauce?  If someone knows where I can buy those peppers let me know?

Love this place!!  My wife who thankfully handles our home finances made a comment the other day that I must love La Bocca because it is on my credit card statement about 2x/week.  I know that sounds crazy but I work on Mill Avenue.  No, I am not a street performer but work for a local advertising agency and the restaurant options if you are looking for good pizza and wine or beer is non existent.  I have tried about 1/2 the menu and all delicious.  The service and atmosphere is great and the managers/owners make us feel quite welcome and wanting to go back.  If you are in the Mill Ave area definitely stop into La Bocca.  Start out with their awesome bruschetta planks appetizer for $12.  You get 4 bruschetta but can mix and match from about 8 or so different kinds. My fav is the prosciutto, fig, mascarpone, and truffle oil.  I know that sounds odd (fig??) but its really really good.  I would recommend for lunch either going for the turkey & brie sandwich or margarita pizza with your favorite topics. Pepperoni is great.  They also have really good beer.  Try either the Franziskaner, Dunkelweiss, or Hoegaarden.  Probably first menu (is it obvious?) that I have memorized and don't mind that I did.  Happy hour deals are also awesome.  I wish there was a La Bocca in North Scottsdale as I would probably end up going on the weekend too as I live in that area.

Unimpressive food and confusing service!  Took my family there today for lunch since my 2 kids are big Pizza fans and being from NY we thought it would be worth giving this a shot based on the NYPD name.  We started out with very confusing signage when you walk in allowing you to either wait for table service or order from the counter in back.  Being the positive person I guess maybe the signage was intentional and felt like I was looking at a NY Subway Map http://www.nysubway.com/map/index.html  If I was the owners of NYPD I would follow the KISS (keep it simple stupid) rule and just offer the walk up option (especially during lunch).  We walked in and since we had not been there before we waited up front for about 5 minutes with about 4+ employees in the back standing around just staring at us.  I finally gave up and walked in the back and asked for help and we decided to order at the counter after it was explained to us that we could order off menu at back.  After trying out 2 different flat soda's finally grabbed some ice tea and waited at the table for our food to come out.  Food came out in good time so that part was positive.  We ordered an eggplant sandwich, meatball sandwich and 2 pieces of pizza.   It's been a few years since we have been back to NY so my taste buds may be a little off but, in my opinion, the food quality was more of a AZPD (Arizona Pizza Dept) quality vs. NYPD - New York quality.  If you are up for ok pizza (good pricing) maybe give NYPD a shot and hopefully you have a better experience than we did.  Since it so close to Ray's Pizza I would recommend playing it safe and going to Ray's Pizza.

This place is awesome! Took my daughter to AZ on the Rocks and she really enjoyed it and I decided to sign up for a month package myself.  I've been there about 5 times and every time I am getting better and better and enjoying it even more.  The employees and other people that are there are really friendly and helpful. Always giving me great tips such as using my legs more as I was always using my upper body and after 2 times climbing was exhausted. Now I can climb 4 times. Looking forward to spending more time on the huge boulders climbing.  What I love about AZ on the Rocks is they have 3 auto lines as I have been going there myself. I went with my brother this past week and got to climb with someone else which was really fun too. If you are looking for a different kind of exercise or just want to have some fun definitely check out AZ on the rocks. Very affordable (even the month package was around $60 unlimited).

If you enjoy (and really who doesn't) amazing and fresh produce, wild caught meats, etc. then definitely check out the Old Town Farmer's Market every Saturday from 8am to 1pm. We've been a few times already and need to get a 2nd produce only fridge in the near future as we come home with way to much each time. McClendon's Farm is the main produce provider at the Old Town Farmer's Market and some of the best produce I have seen.  If you go make sure to bring your reusable environmental friendly bags to put all your produce into. If you forget they have plastic bags. Really fun walking around to meet the other local vendors, try out their delicious foods and get outdoors in downtown Scottsdale.

I saw so many top reviews for this restaurant and am a big fan of breakfast places so thought we would give it a try instead of our normal Sunday breakfast place Butterfields.  If it was not for the really nice waitress I would have given this a 1 star.  We walked in and stood at the front for about 5 minutes with no one to greet us.  One quick suggestion for Breakfast Joynt is have someone at the front greet people or put up a sign to seat yourself.  It was confusing.  We each had a different breakfast and the 4 of us were disappointed.  The sausages tasted burnt.  Sunny side eggs were overcooked.  Biscuit was really soggy from the gravy.  Coffee was not good.

Grandparents had the kids so took advantage of the opportunity to relax and with my wife checked out The Kitchen near our house in Scottsdale.  We were looking for a little nicer/unique restaurant in Scottsdale where we could grab a nice glass of wine and The Kitchen definitely lived up to our expectations.  The Kitchen was a great spot (really nice atmosphere - very wide open) for that.  I would have given it a 5 star but took off 1 star as we were somewhat confused walking in as we had not been there before.  I guess during lunch they don't have table service so you go in, choose the items you want and then bring your food to the table.  We had to go to bar to get a glass of wine. If they had waiter service this would have definitely been a 5 star rating.    The experience of paying for our food, having to find a table, going back up to get our food, going somewhere else to get a drink, etc. just seemed a little confusing and unnecessary.  Ideally it would have been to place order for food and drink, pay at the register, and then someone brought us our food and drink.  The food was really good though (little pricey ($10-14 per person with small side but excluding drink) but worth it.  We tried out a Jambon sandwich (Ham on Baguette), Muffaletta (Capicola, Salami, Swiss, Provolone and Olive Salad on Ciabatta), Beet Salad, and a Pad Thai Pasta side.  Of course, 2 nice glasses of wine.  The Jambon Sandwich and Pad Thai Salad were quite delicious and definitely going to get that again next time.  The Pad Thai had a really great spice to it and wish I got more of that. The beets were good but not anything out of this world.  Adding some wine to the lunch made it that much better and the wine selection was really good (but a little pricey $10-15/glass).  All in all if you are up for a great lunch in Scottsdale and looking for something different than a typical Scottsdale restaurant to experience definitely check out The Kitchen.

25 degrees + date night = great night. We tried out 25 degrees tonight and really looking forward to our next visit.  We started out with some beers. It was a 1st for me trying out a Dirty Ho which is quite the funny name for a Guinness and Hoegarden beer (similar to a black and tan).    We were on our way to see a movie so unfortunately didn't have time for full dinner.  We tried out 2 appetizers and both were  amazing. The cheese and smoked meat board was really good. Definitely ask the really friendly staff for advice on selecting which cheeses you want as I had not even heard of some of the cheese options before.  We also got the tuna and eggplant that sounded odd but wish we had time to order a 2nd plate. It was just that good.  Next time we will try out the burgers as those sounded really good.  25 degrees is a must visit!

We went a little nuts with holiday lights this year for our company holiday party and no matter what kept popping fuses.  The day of the event got fed up with trying to figure the issue out and called our normal electrician.  He was too busy too help so I checked out Yelp, saw great reviews for Selberg Electric and gave them a call. I reached the owner Bryan.  After explaining our issue he even tried to help over the phone.  I was unable to get things working so he agreed to rush up to our house in the afternoon from about 40 minute drive away.  I was shocked he did not charge us a rush fee, travel fees and all the other fees our last electrician (who we won't be using again) charged us and what a great guy too.    He took the time to check all our outlets, power usage and figured out what our issue was.  He never took advantage of our situation and took the time to explain everything going on.  If you have any electrical issues I strongly recommend Selberg Electric.

Was craving a hamburger and popped into Modern Burger at Fashion Square. I was disappointed only sliders were available at the modern burger so went to their full restaurant next door at Modern Steak.  Somewhat pricey for lunch but great atmosphere.    We sat outside and I ordered the kobe burger and a salad.  Was very good and loved the bacon on top of it.

Looking for a night out Cowboy style? Well look no further than Fort McDowell Adventures. Went last night and we had so much fun. Somewhat far drive about 1 mile or so north of Shea on 87 Highway but worth it. If you are going to check it out it's somewhat hard to find. When on 87 go past the casinos and then your next left at a Cowboy sign make a left onto a dirt road. Take that for about 5 minutes till you get to a parking lot and you will be there. Drive slowly as its very dark out and good chance you will see some wildlife such as coyotes (if you don't see them you will hear them out there as we did - very cool).  My daughters had a great time cooking up their own hot dogs over the fire pits and listening to live music. We even got a horse wagon ride and with the limited lights in the area the sky was lit up with the stars so much brighter than we have seen near our home. After we got back from our horse ride my daughters cooked up their s'mores which was a sticky gooey fun time for them (not as much for the parents cleaning them up though). All of us agreed that we are looking forward to that unique experience again.

Had a great late breakfast at RnR this weekend after checking out the local farmers market in downtown Scottsdale.  Trying to eat healthier so went for the make your own omelette.  I selected chorizo, spinach, mushroom and sausage for my ingredients and all blended nicely.  I gave my kids the potatoes and they really liked them.  My wife had the breakfast tacos and thought they were very good.  Saw a few people enjoying the bloody marys going around so next visit will try one of those.  If you are in the mood for lunch make sure to go closer to 11am as they don't serve lunch till 11am.

Okay I have found my new favorite "home office!"  I don't have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.  Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.  The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.  A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.

Was really looking forward to trying this new BBQ location but sadly so disappointed as the location is awesome and the name is quite creative.  If the food was good (didn't even have to be great) we would probably go 2x/month but most likely won't go back again as there are many other better BBQ places to go instead.  We tried the 3 meat platter to get some variety with chicken, pork and brisket. It was ok just nothing special. Chicken was really dry but covered with BBQ sauce it was better.  My wife got the salad with salmon and salmon was quite bad (way too fishy tasting than salmon should be) so definitely recommend to not order.  I guess we should have known to not order fish at a BBQ place.  The baked beans were really good so definitely get that if you want to try P.I.G. out and the service was good so giving it a 2 star instead of a 1 as its really hard for me to write such a negative review. I might give it another try in a few months and hopefully can write a more positive review.

We've been very excited to try out Big Daddy's BBQ AZ since we saw the banners go up the other week and tonight were able to do that.  My family is tired (not sure why since I am doing all the work) of me spending 10-20 hours on our smoker cooking up good BBQ meats so when a BBQ place opens around the corner from our house everyone is happy.  The Mastro's group behind this concept could not have made us happier.  I expected the BBQ to be great but not the service since they just officially opened yesterday.  Everything exceed my expectations so can't wait to go back.  I started out with a Big Daddy's BBQ Honey Ale very cold beer which hit the spot perfect hanging out on the sort of outdoor patio.  Before I get into the food I have to say the layout of this place is really cool.  If you have been to Maloney's (prior bar here) it was fun to see how much the layout was changed.  There is a large indoor dining area but then along the parking lot street is a large patio indoor/outdoor area.  Hard to describe so check it out yourself before it gets too hot here in a few weeks.  Anyway, back to the food since that is the reason we went right?  Big Daddy's features all the classic BBQ items such as baby back ribs, brisket, pork, chicken, and beef ribs. It would have been nice if I had a 2nd stomach to try it all so when the bartender recommended I try out the 3-to-an-order combo sliders with the option of different meats per slider I was sold.  I ordered up the sliced brisket, pulled pork, and pulled beef.  I am a huge fan of sweet potato fries so took that for my side.  With the beer all that came to about $11.  If you are in the Scottsdale area or interested in trying out great smoked BBQ definitely give Big Daddy's BBQ a try.  I know you won't be disappointed (well my smoker might since it sure was easier eating there).

Higher end burger joints seem quite the rage lately (well probably more obvious to me as I love a good burger). Tried out Lush Burger with my family and overall everyone was pleased. Many of us are turning into burger snobs so quite critical when it comes to giving a burger place high reviews.   The kids really liked their fries so definitely try out the sweet potato fries when visiting Lush Burger. The atmosphere / decor was pretty cool and if nice outside definitely sit on the patio. They have really comfy outdoor couches (not ideal for eating a burger on) but great for hanging out with some friends. The burgers were good (maybe a little pricey for what we got) but something I have gone back for a few times. Good meat flavor and seasoned well.

Went with my family to Renegade Canteen and everything was really good. For past few months I've been on the Paleo diet avoiding sugars and grains and sometimes going out to a restaurant can be challenging as I don't like to be one of those annoying customers customizing my order. Well it was pretty simple at Renegade Canteen as there were many options to choose from.  I ordered the shrimp and scallop ceviche that was so good that I literally used a spoon to eat all the remaining tomato ceviche liquid. For dinner I had the Mahi Mahi that was perfectly cooked with a side of brussel sprouts and bacon. Yes, Brussel sprouts and bacon to me sounded like the oddest combination but it was a great combination. The Brussel sprouts were also perfectly cooked.  Asking around the table everyone loved their dinner such as the flat iron steak, huge burger, etc. I tasted the burger and it was very good sans the bun. A little pricey but high quality is worth the cost and can't wait to go back!

I guess they make cup holders for a reason. Placing a full cup of Starbucks coffee on the armrest while driving and not asking for a disaster is well dumb!  Took my car into Genie this weekend to see what they could do to clean the mess. Very pleased with the results but do miss the smell of Starbucks in my car.  Price seemed fair for the detailing work and my car is looking brand new again.

Oh BBQ Island - I seriously love you guys. Spending the day with my Big Green Egg smoker or BBQ is a day I always look forward to especially due to the help from BBQ Island. I 1st found these guys when I decided a few years ago to get a Big Green Egg. Locally they had the best price and were very friendly on the phone. After buying it they assembled and delivered to my house.   I live in N. Scottsdale and still make the drive down to BBQ Island about 1x/month. Shelton and the guys there are beyond helpful and give me awesome tips to feel like a grill master.  I've been to most of their events such as EggFest (for my Big Green Egg) and TurkeyFest. All their events are so much fun, learn a ton and get to try out awesome BBQ.  I decided to smoke a 24 lb turkey for Thanksgiving and went down to BBQ Island for a quick visit to pick up a few smoking essentials. 1 hour later still was there talking with Shelton and some other customers. Got awesome tips for our Thanksgiving Turkey that turned out great. Thanks BBQ Island for all that you do - much appreciated!

Went with wife and her parents for dinner last night to Herb Box.  The temp is finally coming down in AZ so sitting outside on the cute patio was an amazing treat.  The food could have been mediocre and we would have had a nice night; however, the food was far from mediocre.  Very delicious.  Started out with the beef carpaccio which was really good but just a little bit too salty.  I could not tell if the salt was added on or just due to the meat but tasted like extra salt was added for seasoning.  For dinner we had the trout (cooked perfectly) with this yummy mac and cheese as a side.  We also had the balsamic beet side.  I am a huge fan of beets and they did a great job with this side.  Definitely recommend giving The Herb Box a try if you are in the North Scottsdale area.

I hope this doesn't happen to you other dads out there. Hanging out at the pool in late July 2011 with my youngest daughter Ella (4 years old) she made a statement that I will never forget.  "Dad, are you pregnant?" I was blown away by this question and she was dead serious. Don't little kids say the funniest / honest things? I wish adults could get away with that.  Anyway, I finally got the motivational kick in the butt I needed to start taking care of myself. It was not that I was really "that" out of shape / overweight but all the fat was in my belly and as I started getting closer to the 40 year old mark my fast metabolism I used to have significantly slowed down. Sorry my beloved McDonald's but we are officially done!  I was introduced to Brandon (one of the owners) at Premier Fitness Systems through a friend and my only regret is not meeting him sooner. I have been training with Brandon about 3x/week for past 11 weeks and wanted to share my experience with the Yelp community as I strongly recommend you give them a call if you are serious about your health (shouldn't everyone be?).   I don't personally see a huge visual change in my body but my wife and friends say they definitely see a change. Last week or so I am definitely now starting to see some changes and feels really good getting into some of my old clothes. Regardless of the visual change I am feeling amazing. Brandon has been tracking my results each month and the proof is definitely in the numbers and seeing those results is beyond encouraging.  When my daughter shocked me with her question I was at my heaviest I've been in my life at almost 170 lbs. At 5'10" this was not that overweight but I used to always be around 155 lbs and that extra 15 lbs was clearly sitting in my jolly expanding belly. I immediately started eating better and the weight slowly started to come off.  Around 3rd week of August I started working with Brandon and learning about proper posture when exercising, nutrition, and many other helpful tips. Their tag-line of Energy, Passion, and Results is exactly what their team is all about.  My 1st set of measurements were taken on August 31, 2011 where I was down to 160 lbs but still over 22% body fat. Almost all of that was in my belly (abdominal skin-fold) with my chest (man boob area) being 2nd biggest problem area.  Fast forward about 9 weeks later to my latest body fat calculations on November 11, 2011 and I am down to 153 lbs (lost 7 more lbs) and my body fat is down to 17.5% (reduced by 4.7%). I am very much looking forward to my next set of measurements hoping I am below 16% body fat. I popped on the scale this morning and am at 149 lbs - wow! Brandon and the team at Premier Fitness, I wanted to sincerely thank you for all that you do and hope sharing my story earns you new clients. Just please don't get too busy that you can't continue to help me. :-)

Work and live in North Scottsdale and not very familiar with the Chandler area.  After a late morning meeting was starving but did not know where to go. Thank god there is a Yelp app available as it almost never fails me. Launched the Yelp app and saw Coal Burger was only mile away from where I was at. I was craving a burger and saw many good reviews on Yelp so thought it was definitely worth a shot. AND it was so good.  Coal Burger is one I will definitely visit again. The flavor of the meat was really delicious. I ordered a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing and that was very good too.
