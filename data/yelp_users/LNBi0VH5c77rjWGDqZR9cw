Great food.  Reminds me of home cooked New Mexican food (yes, there is a difference).  There is one male owner? who is very much creepy when he's there, but everything else is outstanding.  Very clean.  Homey feeling.  Friends and I recommend it to anyone looking for Mexican food in our direction.

Love their pizza and wing special.  Can't get enough of that cheezy goodness.  The wings?  Done just right.    Had a chicken parm once; not bad.  Not overly memorable, but jot bad.

Food took forever to come out; even though I was in the drive through.  Had it been the chicken I would have understood....it was the fries!  After all of the suspense, it tasted horrible.  Ended up tossing it and grabbing Jack in the Box instead.

For a company as large as they are, they sure do know how to do things right.  I don't often take out a loan to get coffee, but when I do, I make it a Starbucks.

I should be giving Quik Trip 5 stars, as I'm obsessed with their awesomeness....  but I have to say the cleanliness of this particular store is sub-par.    The drinks?  Can't beat it.  Friendliness?  Next to none.  Cleanliness?  They need to get on it.

My husband and I were sat right away.  Our server was very attentive which is a kind of novelty at this type of restaurant.  Our food came out rather quickly and my coffee never ran dry.  What more could I ask for?

The food and beer is amazing but the service usually is slow and sucky.  Don't come in with a time limit.

The service at this location is always sub par; I'm not sure why we tried it again.  I ordered traditional wings and got served mini KFC drumsticks without any sauce.  When I asked to send them back because I miss understood what they thought "traditional hot wings" were they argued with me about it.  Not just one person, but 3; at separate times.  They did finally replace the offending pollo, but it still wasn't awesome.  Sad to say I won't be going back to Native for wings anymore....and that's what they're "known for".

First off, the portions are HUGE!  Every single bite is delectable.  Ther service is outstnading.  It feels like I'm eating in my family kitchen because the servers act like you really are family.  To top it off, there is always something new to look at!!!totally worth it.

Great community over all.  They have a lot of family events that are nice to attend.  The community really does seem to watch out for each other.

We have been using Champs for 5 years now and cannot stop recommending them.  They are honest and trustworthy.  They even go above and beyond for customer service.  They don't try and scam me out of money which is rare in the auto industry.

Just had my first taste!  Amazazing!  Totally worth every single calorie.  Just sayin though, the shop was a bit hot considering it's an ice cream place....

I called ahead hoping to get my food right away.  It was ready, but I still had to wait in line for 10 minutes.  Then , after I paid they still didn't have my fries or drinks.  Took so long to make the fries my gyros were cold.  25 minutes waiting around total.  Wow.

Love the food and service.  My only complaint is that there is no changing table in the bathroom.

Came in for the second time tonight and had an amazing experience again.  I love how clean and well kept the place is.  They also provided a delightful fruit dish for our birthday girl.  On top of the sushi, the miso soup and yaki soba we ordered were fabulous.

I have been to this place a few times now, and love to sing it's praises.  The employees are so nice and accommodating.  They seem to remember my husband and I and that makes us feel very welcomed.  The sweet crepes are delightful.  You can taste the deliciousness of the crepe without being over powered by the toppings.  Totally worth it to get the ice cream on top.  I do wish the peaches were fresh, not canned.  The savory crepes are great.  The chicken inside the balsamic chicken tasted a little like canned chicken, but it worked.  I would definitely order again.  The coffee and tea is fresh, made to order.  I love that the sweetness doesn't over power the taste of the drink itself.

We brought our 1 year old twins in for their first hair cuts!  One was very compliant, the other screamed the whole time.  Both boys received perfect haircuts; exactly what we wanted.
