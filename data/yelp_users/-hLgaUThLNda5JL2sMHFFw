Costco canceled all of my wedding flower orders less than 6 days before my wedding.  After a rather large breakdown a friend and myself started making calls to try and find a florist with the same great prices.  What I found was 100 times better!  Conroy was able to get my order to me, with a lower price than Costco, and the flowers were GORGEOUS.  No wilting, nothing crushed, just perfect flowers in perfect condition.  The customer service was the best I have ever received.  Very helpful and care about their customers.   I will be a customer forever, even just to run by to buy fresh flowers.  I have lived here forever and I am so excited to find such a great store!  Recommend recommend recommend!

Came in for a mole removal at Central location and had an excellent experience!  The PA was so nice, numbed the area perfectly and I did not feel anything.  She also listened to my concerns about scarring since the mole is in a visible area.  Great experience and I will recommend to others. Thanks PHX Skin!

Did they all avoid me because I looked insane making googly-eyes and grinning too widely at everyone who walked by trying to get their attention?  Maybe.  Arrived at 8:30pm on a Tuesday night and saw a large chalkboard sign that said "Please seat yourself" so we sat outside at a table near the fireplace.  The menus are already on the table for guests since it is self-seating-awesome!  Quick decisions!  There were 5-6 tables being served outside plus a table full of Bar Louie Staff having drinks either after work or for a small holiday party.  The manager came by the staff's table frequently to talk.  I smiled and made eye contact with the various servers working the tables around us, the manager at the staff table, the staff at the table and the bussers.  Everyone was wearing Bar Louie shirts, nametags, etc. so it was easy to see who worked there.  For a minute we thought we had to order at the bar but the other tables outside all had servers when we arrived and continued to be served so that wasn't it...It wasn't busy...It didn't close soon...  One server helping the table next to ours looked as if she was going to come to our table but then she grabbed a box full of silverware to place on some tables that had been bussed.  The manager started to walk towards our table and called the busser over too.  He quickly said something to the busser about the fireplace, pointed, and walked back to the staff party table.  I don't know what he was saying, but those delegation skills combined with that solid index finger pointing motion made me even hungrier.  We weren't in a rush, just hungry and wanted to grab something to eat nearby since we had to stop by Target.  At this point we had been sitting at the table for at least 20 minutes.  I was "hangry," had worked a 15 hour day at the hospital and just wanted to relax and drink a few giant martinis+ eat a burger to self-medicate the stress away...  It's so hard for me to give a 1 star review.  Once I gave a 3-star review and then I gave myself a guilt-trip so severe my mother would be proud....  I went to their website to email the experience to the owner(s) of the franchise (so it wasn't a posted review for others to see) but the website only allows you to contact them by choosing the restaurant.
