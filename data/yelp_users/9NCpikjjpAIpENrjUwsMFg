Seriously some of the best Chinese food I've had. What a pleasant surprise for an assuming little place in a strip mall. The egg drop soup was the best I've eaten and my lunch was $4.75!  It fed me twice!!!

I love Randy's!  I grew up in the Midwest and places like this are plentiful.  Here in the valley, especially Scottsdale, have few options for home style food at affordable prices.  I've never had a bad meal here and the pie is fantastic!

Abysmal service. We joined someone from out of town for a gathering. It took 15 minutes for a server to take our order. 45 minutes for food. No drink refills. No manager in sight.

I love having a locally owned joint to visit for coffee and smoothies but I really love that they have great staff. A special shout out to Crystal - she is such a nice person and made me smile. Thanks Crystal!!!!

I had my engagement ring and wedding band soldered. It's perfect and the price was very fair!  Glad to have such a wonderful family owned place in town.

Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  The service, the ambience, the food, the drinks...yum!

If you don't greet me or offer any assistance in the first 3-4 minutes of being in your store, you lost my business. Not even a hello?  So disappointed.  Update:  I received a personal note and apology from the owner. I'll be back in soon!

I'm so glad that we found this place.  I've only had rolls and I highly recommend them. Prices are fair and the lunch special can't be beat, but it's great for dinner as well.  Special shout out to Gary, a great waiter!

I cannot say enough about the staff at this office. They are some of the kindest, most thoughtful, empathetic and sympathetic people I've ever had the pleasure to deal with.  Recently, the time came for our 19-year-old cat, Chloe, to leave us. Our vets office could not see us until the following day and we knew that she should not suffer through the night. We called Hayden Road Animal Hospital because we had previous lived nearby.   Brandi and Dr. Ryan were amazing. The receptionist - I'm so sorry that I forgot her name - was so kind and accommodating.   We made an appointment for another of our cats to see the doctor. She needed a second opinion. Though Dr. Ryan had a similar diagnosis to the previous vet that our Bella Blue had seen, his bedside manner and explanations were far superior.    I cannot recommend them highly enough. If I could give 6 stars, I would!

The long line was totally worth the wait. The service was great, the place was brightly lit and clean and the food is good!  The only thing I would change or request would be a half sizable. This is too much food for lunch for me. Other than that I have zero complaints!

So disappointed. I did not expect to be writing this 1 star review tonight.  We have been going to the Tempe location for years so we were thrilled to have a location open in our neighborhood. We went in for happy hour this afternoon, around 5:00 pm and waited and waited...no acknowledgment from our server (we were told that Lexi would be right with us).  15 or so minutes without even being offered a nod or a glass of water is not ok. We spoke to the hostess, who'd already forgotten us, and she apologized.    We will give them another chance because the food is good but the service must improve. If you can't handle tables when you're not terribly busy, what will the dinner rush be like?

Love the new ownership. Quicker, higher quality service. Better decor. More comfortable. All of that and fair prices as well!

We adore Taylor & Rob. Great tunes. Thanks for making our wedding memorable. Not the same old thing everyone has.

I wish that I'd had the great experience that other reviewers had.   No watermelon mimosas, which was a reason we chose this place. Ordered a regular mimosa, nearly all juice and not much bigger than a shot glass. 11:30 on a Sunday, out of gravy, so no biscuits and gravy.  Quinoa just "wasn't coming out" so I settled for a waffle. Friend ordered a breakfast sandwich and ended up with a burger sandwich ("bun"made of tater tots).  She was hungry and after settling for this because of the lack of gravy, so she bit her lip and just kept it. Our server, Brian, was good, so there's that.   Not sure I can muster the patience to give them a second chance.
