A friend here said you must go here. Well that was some good advice. Nice size bar and plenty of tables spread throughout. Atmosphere very nice, they had 2 folks playing music that was a good mix and enjoyable. Started with a bottle of wine. I went for the scallops. They were delicious, quite large and full of flavor. Our server was top notch. Very attentive and kept the wine glasses full. They also had a full market attached to the place. All kinds of goodies to be had. we took some pies for the road. I had the pecan and was eating it on the plane, wanted to tell the pilot to do a fly by. I want more. We need this in Chicago. This is a must stop if you are in the area.

Okay, you just cannot beat a good deli and this place rocks. I was overwhelmed by the choices but the Rueben was calling. As you walk through he line you just point and ask and pick it up at the end. After biting into my sandwich I could understand why it was crowded. Good food and prices. Service is quick and with a smile. This is a must stop, don't waste your time at a chain.

A friend who lives in the area invited us out for drinks. This is country all the way. The outdoor patio is pretty large the bar is decent size. They had the place decorated cowboy. Hats and boots all over. They had a band playing and they were pretty good, from old country to current it was working as the dance floor was full. The crowd here is older and interesting but people watching is fun.  Not much line dancing going on , its all about the 2 step here. Decent place good time and beer. Food looked good but did not try any. Worth the stop.

This is a nice place. If you looking to catch a game the have what seemed a TV for everyone. Nice large bar for hanging or they do have a restaurant area. The outdoor patio is the place to be. Very well done and even a fireplace to keep you warm on a chilly Arizona evening. Drinks were good and I needed some chow. I had the Rancher , loaded with cheddar, bbq sauce, crispy onion strings and bacon. This was a good burger, the side of slaw was very good also. Service was good at the bar on the patio it slipped a bit but overall good time was had.

I have always been a fan of this airline. Costs are cheap, bags are free they fly to destinations that I need to go. For work or pleasure they do the trick. Boarding has become better over the years. Instead of arriving at the airport way too early to sit on the floor to secure good seats. Pay the extra to get A boarding and you get a choice. The thing I notice on my recent flight was the leg room has shrunk or I'm getting plump. When I put the tray table down it was right on top of me. If the person in front of my reclines I am doomed. I know the airlines are changing and want to pack the plane which almost every Southwest flight is packed these days. Consider how the seats are done, I'm sure you can stuff a lot of people in but still have a little more leg room. Anyway I do like them and will continue to use. Points are good, free flights are nice But for the cost its worth it.

From rags to riches when comparing this against Last Chance. Upscale outdoor style mall. Not to large but it has all the upscale stores to keep you browsing. The grounds are inviting and nice area just to walk around and enjoy. Good stop.

Thanks to a friend for recommending this place. Perfect to start your day with a hearty breakfast. I had the whole hog omelet. This piece of art had Ham, bacon, sausage chorizo and pepper jack cheese with a drizzled creme on top. It was huge and delicious. The juice is fresh and helped wash everything down. Good service and food at reasonable prices. I will return

Just poking around and why not stop in. Standard Tiffany's just like the others. The fun part was being profiled and watched closely by security. It was funny. I just wandered and kept looking and I did spot a wallet. So I waited for the sales gal to finish up with another customer. I kept looking and keeping security on alert. So I was asked how can I help, I pointed to the wallet. She took it out and yes security was close by, I am amused. I look at the wallet and say I will take it. The sales gal was very friendly and helpful. Security may still be looking for me, but I got what I wanted and even paid. I have a Tiffany wallet pinky up.  4 stars to my salesperson.

This is one huge store. Walking through looking for the men's department I felt like I walked a mile. They have everything but no good sales going on when I was there. Store is clean and the racks and shelf's were in order. Plenty of associates around some friendly some well not so friendly. Sad part the unfriendly ones set a bad example and makes me wonder if I will return. Nice selection but the workers need to step up a bit.

Walked by the place various times throughout the week and the smell of the chicken on the wood fire rotisserie was making me bite the air. The place was crowded but we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks and just as fast we got a table. Great view of the restaurant. I went for the chicken and I was a bit surprised at how small it was but that did not matter, It was cooked perfect and full of flavor. This was a good choice. Good food, great service a must stop.

Went here to meet a friend who happens to be a Green Bay Packer fan. This bar is Lambeau Field West, Cheese Head city. It was a Sunday and the Packers were playing. Every seat in the house was reserved, even the bar stools. Since our friend comes here we got in. We did browse and the place is huge. The outdoor patio is extra large with TV's for viewing, they also have a ring for bull riding. Interesting all around.   The story here is drinks are heavy and good. The patrons are dressed to the T in Green Bay fashion. Plenty of Cheese Heads, Jersey's homemade hats anything and everything. They are ready to party. And party they did when the Packers scored a TD. What The....They jump up and start parading around the bar cheering, singing, DJ playing. Just having the time of their lives. It was fun to watch and this day the Pack scored 53 so it was a hot mess of cheese here.    If you are in cave creek this is a must stop just for the shear amusement. Other bars in the area are dedicated to the Bears, Pittsburgh and the Vikqueens. Have to give it to the fans here, they know how to party. Good times...

This is one huge mall. They have a big variety of stores that can appeal to anyone. From low end to high end. On one wing the corners were well represented with Prada, Louis at the entrance and followed up with other big names. All the standard flare for a mall, food court, wine bar I found interesting nice touch. Great indoor place on a hot Arizona day. Worth stopping you will find something.

Wandering about trying to find a place to have a drink and this was the winner. Nice big bar and opened up to the outdoor patio. Very nice and inviting. The place was crowded and I order my standard dirty martini. Bartender Sasha was right on, my tini was made to perfection. She gave us a menu and things did seem pricey but on par with most others. I just felt like drinking and had a 2nd when I spotted the Key Lime Pie and had to have a piece. They brought out this huge piece of pie and I was a happy boy. The first bite made me even happier. It was a case of come near me or touch this pie and we will have issues. Delicious. Between my martini and the pie it was perfect evening. Next time I may have to try some food, but I will have my pie first! Great service, nice atmosphere a must stop.

Walked by here the previous day and the place was packed with a line out the door. We figured it must be good. I made a reservation for the next day, we arrived and had to wait for a few minutes while they cleared the table. Had great seats by the window. Then the wait came. We received a glass of water and then waited. We seen the server buzzing around but evidently we were invisible. Finally she came by and I wanted a margarita. Went for strawberry on the rocks. It was very sweet and hard to explain the taste. Not very good but drinkable. I went for loaded steak tacos. Ok this made up for other things. They were very good and all the toppings were fresh. The guacamole was very good. Service did improve but the evening could have been better.

Wandering Old Town and yelping looking for a place to eat. Our first two choices looked good but too late for food it was music time. Wandered upon the Pink Pony and thought why not. We sat on the patio and they had a one man band playing and he was good. I ordered a drink and was happy with that but needed food. I went for the fried chicken. This was a great choice, the chicken was cooked perfect and full of flavor. Not greasy just crunchy and delicious. I have a happy belly.   I did not want desert so went for a Pumpkin Pie Martini. Holy Hell this was good. Tasted like pumpkin pie with the graham cracker around the rim. Good choice for sure. This was a good stop. The name does not fit and may scare people off but don't be afraid. Jump on the Pink Pony and enjoy

This is just for the bar itself. Located inside the Embassy Suites. Decent bar and plenty of tables inside and out. They do server food but it was all about the liquor for me. Prices were very affordable and the pours were very heavy. The bartender is good and he evens remembers you. Good place for some beverages.
