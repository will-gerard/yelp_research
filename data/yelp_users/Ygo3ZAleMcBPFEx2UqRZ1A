Asked for spicy Teryaki chicken and receive a pile of burnt red peppers on top. Whole dish tasted like burnt food. Bummer. Owners seemed nice.

One of my favorite restaurants in the East Valley. One of the catalysts of the crazy Downtown Gilbert food scene, Liberty consistently creates great burger, pizza and finer cuisine specials each week. Sometimes they post a daily creation on Instagram and we go down to try it.   Standards like the Tower Burger and the Salt River Bar for dessert are not to be missed. The hot chocolate is great and if that's all you want, just go right up the barista at the separate counter. For breakfast, you can't go wrong with the Italian Scramble.   If the line to order at the counter is long, extending to the main entrance, expect 20 minutes in line to order and another 30-40 minutes to get your food. If you have the time, it's worth it.  I'm glad they keep considering the offering. The addition of fingerling potatoes sliced as fries was a welcome addition.

El Sol has amazing food. The Pollo Asado grilled chicken burrito is one of the highest quality burritos in town. Their Chorizo, Potato and Egg burrito is also excellent. The bakery pastries are great. They are closed Mondays. If you like El Zocalo in Downtown Chandler or Mango's in Downtown Mesa, this place is owned and operated by the same family.  Pro Tip: You can get a large container of their fresh salsa at the Sam's Club south of the restaurant on Arizona Ave and the 202.

Chinese + Mexican Fusion. Try the Jade Red Chicken and Emerald Chicken. Assemble a combo where you can choose any 2 meats and choose to eat them plain, in a burrito or quesadilla. Large space, free wi-fi, combos get a free cookie. If it's your first time, ask for an introduction, they will happily provide free samples of everything. Complex ordering and menu system is the only complaint...but the learning curve is worth it.

Best place in MGM. Great service, great food. Highly recommend the flat iron steak, sub out the fries for the potatoes. The pizza is great, not average, it's wood-fired nicely with very flavorful quality toppings. For a nice meal in the MGM, hit this. We want to go back to try the Chocolate souffl√©.

One of the best date night dinners we have had. The ambiance and attention to detail was truly special. The staff is experienced and well-trained. We always had service when we needed it but it was not over-bearing. The food was great. The steak was perfectly cooked, even for my medium-well taste. The onion strings are a hearty portion and great for sharing as an appetizer. We recommend Tarbell's to our friends and will go back again.

Just found out they'd been lying to me for a year about who was covering my therapy expenses. I was in an accident and they said the insurance for the guy who hit me was paying. They didn't tell me this once, they told me every time I asked if visits were still covered over many many visits. "Do I need to pay?" "Nope, you're covered" every time.  I'm am shocked at how the billing and communication has been managed. Apparently I have an extremely large bill now in the form of a medical lein.   I found this out through my attorney. Dynamic has not communicated this to me directly even to this day. I was actively deceived about coverage and cost. I tried to call and investigate but the billing department is "gone for the day" even though they just talked to my attorney on the phone.   Stay away.

The food is very flavorful and the fresh made tortillas are delicious. I like to order the sweet pork burrito or salad. Either way, get some of the cilantro ranch. That stuff can make any meal special. Sometimes we order chips and queso dip. They have a really excellent drink selection with the standard coke fountain products but take it up a notch with pebble ice and a selection of refillable drinks like strawberry lemonade, horchata, etc.  You order in a line similar to Chipolte. You ask for what you want and don't want as you go down the line. They have one guy in that line up, right after the burritos come out of the rolling oven that really tries to rush you, he's almost always there. Maybe he's mistaking the training to be "energetic" with being "pushy". If he could switch his "what do you want" style to "would you like to try" and give you a moment to think it would be a five star experience.

P.F. Changs but fast-casual. The orange chicken is a stand by that we enjoy, we like to sub out the white rice for the fried rice. The wonton soup is great. Love the lettuce wraps.  This location can get very, very busy. The take out counter can get slammed and you have to help them find your order :) sometimes the pickup time can be an hour after your order on busy weekend nights so plan ahead.  Dana Park's parking can also get very busy, Pei Wei has a nice amount of reserved parking for take out orders which is very convenient.

Great food, fresh from the farm. These burgers are some of the very best anywhere. The BBQ Bacon Bleu Burger is my favorite in PHX.   The weather from November - April is great and bing quite a crowd to enjoy the picnic benches outside. Expect a 45 minutes wait from the pop-up tents over the walk way on in.  The BBQ chicken pizza is very good, we like to add pesto sauce as well.  When available, the Butter Pecan Milkshakes are fantastic.  Don't miss the French Fries which come in great varieties: garlic, sweet potato (with pineapple dipping sauce), and baked potato (all the baker toppings on top of fries)!  The homemade onion rings were featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. They are extra crunchy and made from scratch.  Since our family eats here a lot I like to mix things up by ordering other great menu items like the breaded green beans and the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.  The Fried Zucchini is great, some people think the sauce is too acidic tasting but it depends on the season and the tomatoes used at the time.  I love that Joe honored his childhood home by preserving it as a retro-futuristic cool establishment. Visit the bathrooms to see the full design details.

Best Cheesesteak I have had. Their specialty Buffalo Chicken sandwich is even better. Try the awesome sweet potato fries. Super clean, super friendly.

The Zues Pita! Chicken, Gyro, Falafel, Feta, Tzatziki. Delicious. The hummus is great. Five stars for the food, hack a star for the oddly slow but friendly service.

Open, free place to create and collaborate. Try a Wednesday night "hacknight" or Wednesday "brownbag" lunch session for your first time. Just walk in, find an open desk, get on the free wi-fi and chat with those around you.

Best Ice Cream in the East Valley. It's so thick and creamy that even the smallest serving size is plenty. I like cinnamon the best but have enjoyed many flavors.

Friendly owners take great care of you. The chorizo burrito is excellent, I enjoy having an occasional breakfast here. The location is a bit tricky to find a block off of Arizona Avenue on Wall Street. Be sure to track this place down and give it a try.

Owner personally takes care of you. Free wifi. Great place for fast, quality Greek food. I like the Chicken Shawarma Pita with fries which is a frequent lunch combo for $7.50. Having come here occasionally over many months I see the slow and steady improvements that have been made to the register, the menu screens, etc. Love this local place.

I like the Carne Asada. The place is consistent in quality and service. There's usually a crowd and limited seating but they keep things moving. It's not my fav place for Mexican food, but one we like to go to occasionally to mix things up. Love that they started in a backyard and built their business from there.

Great to see Pita Jungle arrive in Dana Park. This location is smaller than the other ones I've been to and can fill up quickly. We have been here a few times and have had consistently good service.   We picked up platters for a party. They were ready to go on time and the food was perfectly prepared.  The layout is interesting, a lot of the room is taken up by a waiting area and reception kiosk. It seems like more tables could have been made available inside. I like the separate take out door and counter. It seemed like the bartender was also in charge of the takeout orders. We were well taken care of and didn't wait at all.  The outdoor seating and windows are going to take a lot of direct sunlight in the summer. It will be interesting to see what they do to address the heat and keep people cool inside and out from May - October.  As far as the food, our Pita Jungle favorites are the Chicken Chipotle Lavash Pizza, Cilantro Humus and Chicken, the amazing baked Cauliflower with onion strings and sauce (don't miss this one, every time we order it people sitting nearby ask about it) and the Roasted Potatoes.  The kids meals are pretty cool. Kids get to pick from a variety of items to build their plate.

Really disappointing. We had heard good things and Blue Lemon failed to deliver everywhere.  This is an order-at-the-counter place. They say "gourmet express" on their cups. Unfortunately it was neither gourmet nor express.  The line to place the order had 4 or 5 groups in front of us. There are two registers, but only one was open. We waited 15-20 minutes to place our order. What was disappointing is that the place was almost empty and there were 5 or so staff standing around waiting for food to come out of what appears to be a very small kitchen for the size of the restaurant. They probably can't open the second register, as it would slam the tiny kitchen.  We sat down and waited for our meal which didn't seem to take too long to arrive. Unfortunately, the food had been cooked a while before we received it because the steak was cold. Not cool or slightly warm, but actually cold. The sweet potato fries were both cold and soggy. Not fresh, not hot and not crispy.   The tasty-sounding short rib sandwich was not very flavorful, not very warm and had not so great iceburg lettuce.  Back to the steak. Did you know they do not have a steak knife in the whole restaurant?  This made for a comical moment as our son wanted to take a turn at trying to cut the steak with the knife and ended up sliding the plate around so much that it flew off the table. :)  This concept, price and menu has some similarities to Liberty Market in Downtown Gilbert. Except that Liberty Market is really good. This is terrible.
