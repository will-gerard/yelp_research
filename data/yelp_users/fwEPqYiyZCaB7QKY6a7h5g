**Disclaimer: I've only been to TOCA once, but had a great experience. I will update this review later.**  Have had ongoing right knee pain for the past 6+ years. As athletes, most of us aren't a bunch of wusses when it comes to pain and tolerance for it. Walk it off, damnit, walk it off!     Well, one week, there was no walking off anything. It was getting in the way of my training. After losing a season this year because of surgery, my Coach and I went into panic mode to figure out what this was.   After an MRI  found some awesome chondromalacia and patella - femoral malignment (Thanks a lot, hammer throw), my PCP referred me to see Dr. Cummings.   Front office staff was very friendly, and I had plenty of time to fill out of my paperwork. I will say they were running about an hour behind, but it wasn't a problem for me - at least not that day.    Had some X-Rays of both knees done on-site while waiting for the Medical Assistant to download the images off my MRI disc.   Dr. Cummings actually introduced himself to me as Dean when he walked into the room, which I thought was pretty cool!   Confirmed everything found on the MRI, and told me I'm experiencing something called "dyskinetic chain". Cause? The joint of my big toe. INSANE! Never would have expected that. No surgery necessary, just need some top-notch physical therapy.  Not once did I feel belittled by him as other reviews and peers of mine warned me. Not even a little hint of specialist arrogance. Nope!   I also appreciate the fact that he didn't try to "used car salesman" me to use their on-site PT Clinic.   He sent me to his colleague (Dave Hogarth, DPT in Chandler), who specializes in this specifically.  Which by the way, that guy scares the holy crap out of me with his manual therapy techniques. * shudder *  Makes the PT I saw for post-surgical rehab this summer seem like a trip to the Massage Therapist (and that guy beat up on my surgical sites pretty bad - Trevor, please don't hate me for this!).    But my range of motion is improving with this program, so can't complain. Oh, and he's a former decathlete who *gasp* actually understands the hammer throw!   Hopefully the next time I see Dr. Cummings, I'll be discharged.   I HIGHLY recommend TOCA for your orthopedic concerns and specifically Dr. Cummings especially if you're a high level athlete. Don't mess around; go to the best.

Outstanding team of cardiologists here at Biltmore Cardiology!   I had been experiencing some intense chest/breast pain out of nowhere. You know, just sitting on your couch, laying in bed, sitting at your desk.  Pretty scary when you're a youngin like me. Heck, anyone of any age, but you get the idea.  My Mom has fibrocystic breast condition (easily managed when you dial back on your caffeine consumption or eliminate it all together, no fun), and told me to hit up my OB GYN to make sure there weren't any suspicious lumps.   Well, clearly a mother always knows what's up.   OB GYN was almost positive the chest pain I was experiencing was related to that amazeballs fibrocystic breast condition (aww, thanks for sharing, Mom). But, as an elite level athlete, she didn't want to take any chances.   Out of the office with a referral in hand to Biltmore Cardiology. Boo ... But better safe than sorry.   Saw Dr. Akil Loli and Dr. Harris on my first visit. Teenage like blood pressure, normal EKG, heart sounded great. He also said some of my chest pain could be related to all the torso twisting involved with hammer throw.   Caring, compassionate, respectful specialist, and very easy to talk to. He gets major points for knowing what my sport is. Usually I have to explain it as Track and Field / Hammer throwing isn't too popular in the United States.  Dr. Loli still wanted to go forth with an echocardiogram and stress test because of my lifestyle. Nothing like only making it to Stage 6/7 on the treadmill to make you feel like a fat athlete, no?!   Front desk ladies and the testing team were stellar!   Had Dr. Loli's partner, Dr. Gordon (retired, but occasionally covers for the practice) review my results. Clean as a whistle.   What a relief!  I hope I never have the need to see a cardiologist again. But if I do, I know I'm in good hands with anyone here.   Highly recommended.

I'm still trying to figure out how I lived seven-ish years in Ahwatukee, and somehow missed out on Los Taquitos!   Came here a few weeks back with Yelpers Monica O., Cheryl B., Shannon E. and Rick N. for a lovely workday lunch.   If it's your first visit, you absolutely MUST try the infamous street tacos.   My first go, I tried the Carne Asada, Pollo, and Fish three taco meal with rice and beans.   They were all delicious, but the Carne Asada was the star. Some of the best I've had in a long time. The spices worked well together, and no tough pieces were to be found.   The Red Salsa they top everything with is nothing short of amazing. It's not blazing hot, but tastes great.   I enjoyed it so much I dragged my Dude back out a Saturday that same week, where we discovered the Carnitas are right up there with the Carne Asada!   Very tender, and it tasted like some type of apple and brown sugar rub was used.   And again for another workday lunch when I got stuck on a client call and missed a vendor provided lunch.  This place is small and gets packed at high noon quickly.  Call it a dive; call it a dump. If you're coming here for ambiance (not delicious tacos), you're doing it wrong!  I look forward to trying other menu offerings at Los Taquitos, but for now, I'm hung up on those amazing street tacos.  Update 9/18: Tried the Bombero Burrito con Pollo. Do not order this if you hate spicy; also, it's massive (see photos) so SHARE. Barely ate half! Was able to sample the Vegetarian tacos, also delicious.

If you're looking for tasty sushi in Ahwatukee, it's pretty tough to compete with RA. Yes, it's a franchise, but willing to overlook that.  My favorite part about this place is happy hour . . . On the Sushi, that is! But of course, there's drinks. Years ago, it used to be a regular event for my girlfriends and I during the week!   There's so many different types of rolls on the happy our menu which makes it difficult to choose.   I'm a big fan of their Viva Las Vegas, Tootsy Maki, Spicy Tuna and Rainbow Rolls. You  can't go wrong with any of the Nigiri.   I also LOVE their Spicy Miso Soup. If you find yourself sick, get this to-go. Your sinuses will thank you.   Drinks? The Blushing Geisha and Samurai Cowboy.   Service can be pretty hit or miss, but "miss" so few and far between I'm willing to overlook that.   Always look forward to a RA adventure after seeing a movie!

I've been eating at Neo Tokyo for over 10 years.  Whether it was before or after a movie, wanting some take-out after work; heck, sure I went on a few awkward teenage dates here. It's always a great choice.   While Neo Tokyo has evolved over the years, the food has remained consistently delicious.   You walk up to the counter, order, and put a number on your table.   I can usually get out of here for $8 or less if I'm alone.   Some of my favorites:  1) Orange Chicken - Great spices in the sauce, add the chili oil to it and it's out of this world 2) Teriyaki Chicken Bowl - Quality meat, no mystery meat to be found here 3) Sweet and Sour Pork   What's cool about Neo Tokyo is you can get fusion dishes, from Thai, to Korean, to Japanese.   I'm looking forward to trying the Dan Dan Noodles and Chicken Lettuce Wraps.   Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for a free Egg Roll or Crab Puff.  Stop by for a quick bite before a movie at AMC, you won't be disappointed!

Great practice, great dentist! Been going here for the past six years now and have no plans to change dentists.  Dr. Morales is fantastic! I'm not a big fan of going to the dentist, but he makes it easier with his humor and understanding of patient concerns. Also, Tammy the hygienist was really friendly.   The one thing I found interesting though is staff turnaround here. Everytime I go, it seems like there's ALWAYS a new crew of people (hygienists, billing, reception, etc.). Haven't had a problem; everyone is great ... You just wonder why this is the case.   Recommended!

I had to come back and update my review after this weekend. What an exceptional dentist and practice!  Been having some pain on the left side of my jaw / face for about a month now. Usually, it would go away after a few hours.   Well, not this Sunday. Teeth couldn't make contact with each other without a world of hurt!   Called the emergency line; heard back from Dr. Morales within the hour. Phones in an antibiotic (in case it was an infection) and some pain drugs to my pharmacy.   *Update 8/27: Found out today that Dr. Block was actually the one that got the message and passed it along to Dr. Morales. Obviously, never been to him for anything dental, but seemed like a nice guy.Thanks so much!*  WHOA.  To top it off, Kokopelli was able to work me in this morning, no sweat.   Doc takes a look. Teeth are pristine, no decay. No infection to be found. . . Whew . . . Wait, what's up with your jaw?!    Turns out I have TMJ - Guess a decade plus of Olympic / General Weightlifting has finally caught up to me.   Athletes know what I'm talking about, that "Oh-Holy- $#!+-Clench-My-Teeth-No-Idea-How-I'm-Going-To-Get-Up-Out-Of-This-Super-Heavy-Full-Clean-or-Back-Squat!" type of jaw/teeth clenching.  Possibly grinding my teeth in my sleep as well.   Got some impressions done for night and sports guards, and some muscle relaxers for the week while I wait for them to be made.   Unreservedly recommend Dr. Morales and Kokopelli Family and Cosmetic Dentistry to all of my Yelp friends - Since my whole family already goes here, haha!   Come here for all your dental needs if you want to be treated with compassion and as a human being - Not just another insurance claim or dollar sign.  It's worth the drive to Ahwatukee. :)

I love Kohls. I don't even live near this one anymore, and still go out of my way to come here. OK, fine, usually on my break at work or before / after an appointment at my docs nearby.   Easy and plentiful parking.   Fantastic home goods selection (for the love of God keep me out of the cookware section, haha)!   Occasionally will find some great threads here, too.  Love that they carry Lauren Conrad's line here (always some great apparel, plus cute jewelry), Apt 9 and Rock and Republic.   So thankful that the Apt 9 / R&R denim, career pants fit me well. Many power athletes will lament the "smaller in the waist, giant in the quads + butt = pant shopping is HELL!" dilemma and it's rare I've had to take either brand to a tailor.   Recently got out of here with three tops and a new pair of jeans for under $35!   Active wear selection and pricing is decent if you're a Nike fan.  Spend $50, get Kohl's cash. Haven't and won't open a Kohls credit card, but it seems like there's plenty of benefits if you shop here a lot.   Well organized, clean store, friendly employees and excellent customer service. Will continue coming back.

** Hello ... Yelp ... Anyone home?  This place is now called Ironwood Urology. Please update. Sent you the requested information. :) **   After a long, distressing three months of misdiagnosis galore "Back injury - Go see a physical therapist; enjoy going broke!" "No, you have a 13cm kidney cyst!" "Just kidding, it's severe hydronephrosis!", my primary care doctor sent me to Ironwood Urology.    Dr. Bigelow is the bees knees! He was the surgeon that removed my right kidney and is now my urologist.   He was great with me and my family before, during and after the procedure.   Initially, I actually saw another doctor that was leaving the practice before being passed to Dr. Bigelow.  Found that unlike a lot of doctors, he took the time to explain to me what exactly a UPJ obstruction was (I didn't even ask, wow!), and was quick to reassure me that:   1) Nothing I "did" caused my kidney to die, as it likely happened in-utero, and  2) Nothing my mother "did" during her pregnancy caused this.    I especially appreciated him understanding that as a serious athlete, getting back to training was of great importance to me . . . While not compromising my safety or rushing the healing process.  Everyone in the practice has been pleasant, promptly returned phone calls, and speedy lab results.   Wouldn't hesitate to recommend Ironwood Urology, Dr. Bigelow or Dr. Avila to any family and friends.

Nice, small community library close to work. I do a lot of reading on my tablet these days; however, still love that "book in hand" feel. * oooooohhhhhh geek out! *   Free WiFi, great selection of books, CDs, DVDs. You can also use your online account to request items that may be available at let's say, Burton Barr, and pick them up right at Ironwood!   Why knock off one star?   While the parking might be plentiful, the engineer who designed the parking lot deserves three kicks in the balls for this design. MINIMUM OF THREE!   I know stupidity is inevitable on the road, but come on, lady, check your mirrors before backing up full throttle. It's already an awkwardly designed parking lot as is.   Check out Ironwood Library if you live in Ahwatukee or find yourself in the neighborhood!

So, think it's pretty clear that I'm not a student at Mesa Community College - I attended a four year university in Colorado.   However, I've been bouncing around the idea of completing a second Bachelor's alongside my MBA. Should I need to knock out some credits, best believe it will be at MCC. Have heard nothing but good things from friends and strangers alike.   With that, I spend a TON of time utilizing the Track and Field facility - specifically, the hammer ring.  Mesa Community College has the premier Track and Field facility in the Southwest! Oh, you don't believe me huh?!   First, come and check it out for yourself.   Second, if you aren't impressed, please go find a nearby facility that has as much space MCC does dedicated to the throws. It's a thrower's paradise; like our own private island.   This is a big friggin deal! When you keep the throwing events off the infield, you save yourself a lot of unnecessary hassles in terms of safety while other events are going on.  Seriously, a javelin runway, three discus rings, two shot put rings and one hammer ring WITH a nearby runway for turns and drill work.    MCC also hosts the Mesa T&F Classic each year in April- And a phenomenal job at that. This meet attracts some of the best athletes in the nation: Collegiate teams, post collegiates and professionals. Come check it out next year; there's something for everyone!  I want to express my sincerest gratitude to Head Coach Steve Jacobs and Throws Coach Collin Post for allowing me and my Coach to train here. As you both know, it takes a VILLAGE to do this post-collegiately (especially when you WORK full time), and having a training home means the world to me.   Recommended - Come out to the Track and get in shape, knock out some transfer credits, earn your associates. MCC is a great and welcome community to be a part of.

I had my partial thyoidectomy last month at Banner Desert. Smooth sailing all around; I can honestly say I didn't have a bad experience with anyone that works there.   It was also awesome I didn't have to share a room with anyone . . . Especially when my sister later told me I was saying stuff such as, "Where were these drugs when I was in college?!" among other things I'd rather forget I said while recovering/baked. :)

If you haven't checked out Video Paradise and you live on this side of the tracks (or nearby) . . . Man oh MAN are you missing out!   Video Paradise is locally owned and operated, and according to my friends that grew up in the Valley. . . it's been around forever. As in, they would visit this place as kids back in the VHS days.   It brings back memories of Blockbuster back in the day, without the corporate plasticky feel. Not too many places like this exist anymore.   Give yourself plenty of time as it's easy to spend an hour browsing. Great date night idea to keep in your back pocket.   They have everything from new releases, foreign films, all the oldies-but-goodies, and TV on DVD. Pretty sure there's Bluray here and there's game rentals. There's also an adult section cordoned off to your right as you enter if that's your cup of tea.   The best part? Five rentals for five days for five dollars. It doesn't include the new releases, but you really can't go wrong with this!

I've been eating food from Florencia Pizza Bistro for over 10 years now, and not once have I actually dined in! *gasp*   Every single order has been pick-up. Never have met any employee here with a bad attitude, on the phone or at the bar.   I will say though, inside the decor is cute. Various wall hangings, somewhat dark for mood.   So yeah, my suggestion will be pretty simple.   If you're here for pizza and you order anything but the Putanesca Pizza: You're doing it wrong!   Garlic and olive oil instead of traditional sauce, chicken, a generous scattering of capers and kalamata olives, red onion and sliced tomatoes.    It's the perfect combination of savory and salty flavors. The crust is melt in your mouth status.   What more could you ask for?   Oh wine, duh. Pizza and Netflix night is incomplete without my old friend Pinot Noir.   Check it out for consistently delicious pizza!   Hope Florencia stays open for a long time. Maybe we'll finally dine-in one of these days we're paying a visit to the ol' 'Tuke.

So, this here genius ignored a knee injury / some functional deficits for over six years.   See my Orthopedic Clinic Association review, hooray dyskinetic chain and patella femoral malignment! http://www.yelp.com/biz/orthopedic-clinic-association-tempe#hrid:wm7FN8FkYeWy9SedrvAMHw   Had the opportunity to work with Dave Hogarth, the Clinic Director. Well, more like Dr. Cummings said, "See Dave and ONLY Dave. Your athletic career depends on it, missy. Do it for your own good, or your right leg will EXPLODE!"   Joking aside, very nice and knowledgeable guy.  Also, I forgive him for being an ANGELS fan!   A former Decathlete (Track & Field for everyone out there thinking 'whaaaat!?'), I appreciated his more in-depth knowledge of the hammer throw and its mechanics. Dave "gets it" and when he didn't, he asked thoughtful questions.  Effective and varied home program, never static, didn't get bored. Fusionetics Sports Science is a great platform for visual learners, because you can compare your form with the video demos.  While Dave was fun to work with . . . Just thinking about the manual therapy techniques he used on my knee / foot / ankle / hip makes me want to go hide in a corner somewhere. And the FAT stick of doom. *shudder*  Can't complain too much, because I haven't felt "injury pain" while throwing, walking upstairs,  deep squat in my clean + jerk, snatch, back + front squat in weeks. Plus some gains in range of motion; oh yeah!  What sets this place apart from their competitors? Giving patients a maintenance program upon discharge so they don't lose their gains. This is the first time I've had this happen, and I'm impressed!   Also, pleased to report that Dave turned me loose when things improved for me, and didn't attempt to capture more co-pays and sessions. Listen to your patients, PTs.   Everyone from the front desk crew to the techs to the AT's were always very helpful. Steve Arias and Mallarie Hanna were always fun to work and chat with.   Excellent customer service with a recent billing mistake.   Overall, very nice, no frills, "gets-the-job-done" facility. It's also nice that I was able to meet a nice variety of athletes from the community, not just a "runner's club" clinic.  I recommend Dave and Physiotherapy Associates Chandler for your rehabilitation needs, full stop.   Hopefully I won't have a reason to come back, but it's nice to know this resource is available on my journey the next three years!

Much, MUCH better customer service than the Ray and 56th (Casa Paloma) ULTA location!   Greeted at the door, and immediately approached by an associate and her trainee.   No, seriously, I didn't even have time to walk on over to the Smashbox section to find my product.    Forgot the woman's name (blue colored hair and a nose ring), but she was extremely helpful and super fun to chat with.   She told me Smashbox discontinued their pots of stand alone Brow Tech Wax. You can only buy it in the Brow Tech Brow Filler Pots now . . . sad! She recommended Anastasia's Brow Fix wax pencil.   And it gets the job done!   Thanks for restoring my faith in ULTA. :)

When you're a thyroid and kidney patient, you get the joy of visiting Los Vampires at Sonora Quest rather frequently. Oh no, I'm not afraid of needles. Just sick of catching crap from friends, family and co-workers for walking around looking like an intravenous drug user . . .   I've been both right when the place opens at 7AM, and after work (4PM). You can either walk in, or book an appointment online. Highly recommend just making an appointment, because while you can just show up, prepare for a major wait. Appointments I've made are almost always on time.   Syed is awesome. Never a bruise or a goose egg when my appointments are with him! :)

After making the mistake of reading Yelp reviews for Chandler Regional Medical Center I was half expecting to "die". Ooh, the drama! Who likes hospitals, anyway -  Hypochondriacs?!    Well, not such a horrible experience after all.   Had my ginormous DEAD kidney removed here three weeks ago by Dr. Kevin Bigelow.   Getting admitted was fairly easy, and everything financial-related was explained clearly. Nice and updated rooms.   Shout out to the caring and compassionate staff here: Edith, Ocamie, Winnie, Colby and Diann. I was scared out of my mind for such a major surgery and y'all really helped put me at ease.   Therapy dogs are awesome. :)   Not-so-bright things . . .    * The one day nurse that sat on her ass eating McDonald's her whole shift and told my family "It's OK if you move Meagan out of the blood clot boots / walk her around / to the bathroom!" Nah, lady, you're LAZY and wanted to lighten up your workload. Clearly didn't work well with others.   * Family said the waiting area could use an upgrade, not super comfortable and rather crowded.   So don't let the suspect reviews discourage you from using CRMC, especially if those reviews are about the Emergency Room. ER's suck everywhere!

My 18-year-old brother hangs out with his friends here often, and was mind blown that I'd never been because:   1) I'm a sucka for local coffee . . . And addicted  2) It's close by my place  Finally gave in after a quick run to Sprouts!   The Barista seemed to be putting on one heck of a show, something you don't see too often. Felt like I was hanging out at a bar, not a coffee joint.   Like I usually do when trying out a new place like this, I asked him what would he recommend. He said "Black and White!" without hesitation. OK, normally don't drink milk bomb "coffee", but let's just give it a go!   This drink was a combination of light and dark mocha. Super, super sweet for my tastes, but enjoyable every once in a while. Oh yeah, not to mention, absolutely wired for the rest of the day!   If your drink is under $3.99, you better have cash with you.  WiFi is regulated; you'll 3 hours of Internet from your coffee receipt. Never really need that much time anyway when I'm working on-the-go . . . It's just a little strange, and likely super annoying for those college students out there.   Patio overlooks a man-made lake. Nice place to chill out and read a book if you're not competing with a large number smokers for oxygen.   I look forward to coming back and trying their different roasts (read: their actual coffee).

If you're looking for a New Mexico experience, you're not going to find it at Si Señor.   This place has been on my bookmarks for over a year now, ever since some Greyhead sent Andrew C. and I hate messages dropping the name of this place for our Carlsbad Tavern reviews.   Will NEVER understand why people feel the need to do that  . . .   We stopped in on a Friday night for dinner.   Seated immediately, and our server was polite and attentive.   No booze; just two iced teas.   The chips and salsa came with four types of dips: Bean, Green, Red and some kind of Sour Cream and Green Chile combo (delicious).  Your first bowl of chips is complimentary; additional bowls are $3.   We ordered:   #2: Chile Relleno Plate with Both Red and Green Sauce #14: Beef Chimichanga with Red Sauce   The Rellenos were soggy, and very little spice.  The Beef Chimichanga was also soggy with unseasoned beef.   Monica O. said the beans tasted like Rosarita; I think Rosarita tastes better than the beans on these plates.  The best part of the meal were the Sopas, but those are pretty tough to mess up to begin with.   What a bust, skip it.   Nunca más, Si Señor!

My friend came into town on a Thursday night for a visit, so my boyfriend and I decided to take her out for something she hadn't been able to find much of in Wisconsin: SUSHI!  We hadn't been here yet, so it was a bit of a gamble just telling her, "Yelp said it was a GREAT place!"   Safe to say, BEST sushi on this side of town! Great ambience, fresh sushi (we tried several of the rolls and some sashimi), had a fun time doing sake bombers. Service was prompt and friendly.  Will definitely be coming back for happy hour!

The best part about living in this part of Chandler is being very close to what many call the "Asian Mecca" of the east valley.  There's no shortage of delicious restaurants, grocery stores, tea shops, etc. and you'll be lucky if you get to try them all. Maybe this should be my next bucket list?!   That being said, since I moved here just over a year ago . . . I'm kicking myself for not trying Tokyo House sooner!   When you walk in, it's rather empty. Not a lot of décor, but very clean. Don't let the lack of business scare you away. 102.5 KNIX playing in the background; love it!  The best part of this place is the little old man / owner. He is a riot, very happy and cheerful. Cares about his customers. If you don't know what you're ordering, he'll happily show you a book with pictures. He also suggested we get the combo, as it comes with a drink, egg roll, your dish for just under $7.   The Dude and I decided to share the Orange Chicken and Chicken Yakisoba.  Ho lee f Batman, best Orange Chicken ever! That other establishment on the other side of Chandler can suck it, because this stuff was amazingly fresh! You could tell someone actually went to the trouble of using fresh oranges instead of some corn syrup-y, jarred garbage.  The owner also said he could make it spicier for us, which was great!  I also really enjoyed the Yakisoba, but will ask for double noodles next time as it's served on white rice.  All of this came out to around $15.   Tip: They're closed on Sundays.   Can't wait to try their Teriyaki, Orange Beef, and other dishes. Would make for easy take out.

Oh jeeze. AJ's is one dangerous place for me . . .   No way would I ever do my weekly grocery shopping here - Far too expensive!   I LOVE cooking, entertaining and hospitality. When I'm having my family or friends over for dinner or a party, I'll pull out all of the stops and do some of my shopping here.   Superb wine and beer selection and everything else in between that you could possibly need to be an excellent host.   If you're thinking about hitting up "Yuppie Lunch Hour", just do it! I work nearby, and a lot of us will come here frequently for lunch. Excellent soup and salad bar, and the sushi is always pretty fresh. Happy hour is from 2-4 . . . daily!   And you can't beat $1.51 for a GINORMOUS iced tea - Suck on that, Starbucks! Blackberry Sage tastes great. Too bad it's only available Saturday. Great place to get your coffee fix as well.   **UPDATE 6/11: Reusable iced tea and coffee tumblers are BACK -  75 cent refills on iced tea and brewed coffee DAILY! $10.99. Hurry if you want one; these babies go fast . . . been meaning to get one since February!**  At the end of the day, you get what you pay for, and AJ's exceeds expectations in terms of quality.

While I'm not a big fan of non-standard nail establishments (see my Madison Avenue review, then let Debra or Kate work their magic on you), Valley Nails definitely gets it done.   Some of the best nail designs you will ever see. So it pains me to write this review!  The only reason why I have to knock off three stars is false advertising. And excessive push for additional services I said "no" to multiple times.  Back in my student days when home one summer, I just wanted an express pedicure. Didn't need the crazy scrubs, massage, just some sexy looking toes.   When I presented my ID while cashing out, the woman turned to speak with another woman and told me because I didn't spend over $30, I would only get $5 off my service.   ... Not a single sign in sight that states this stipulation on any service menu in the salon.   Yeup, very shady, Valley Nails!  If you're not going to honor what's advertised or at least post the stipulation of what you told me ... Don't offer it, period.  I paid and left without being too disgruntled, but not too sure I'll be back.

Rules of being a power athlete:   If you can find a pair of jeans that fit your larger quads and butt and smaller waist with minimal alterations, YOU BUY THEM.   Even if it means you go into a store that's target demographic is from 14-22.   Even if that mean you walk into American Eagle and get mistaken for a teenager.  Really, the ONLY reason I shop here is for the quality denim (and have for over 10 years-. I'm far too old for those goofy graphic tees and hoodies displaying AE all over.   I don't have to worry about my ass busting them open squatting down at work on casual Friday, and the most alterations expected are a simple hem job my buddies at Nordstrom or Nordstrom Rack can assist with.  The 40% off holiday sale was quite the steal.  The customer service consists mostly of uninterested and hormonal guys and gals.  But again, not my #1 concern here.  So, if you see someone in their late twenties-early thirties shopping at American Eagle, don't judge us, kids and parents... We love the jeans as much as you do!

As someone who enjoys cooking, Sur La Tab is what easily can burn my bank account faster than you can say "40%+ off Le Creuset!" and, "Oh, we totally need some summer placemats, towels, napkins!"  Seriously, how can you hate this place?!  Almost any Culinary gadget you need can be found here.    I've found a fantastic garlic peeler roller (dishwasher safe, what?!), julienne tool, grill tongs for my Dude and some newer salt and pepper mills here recently.   And I'm still eyeing some cutting boards we used at a cooking class at Scottsdale Fashion's location. Oops!   Never a bad experience here with an associate, always more than helpful.  Now to practice some self control, as I work less than half a mile away.

Teakwoods is another great place for wings in this area.   Seriously, if you're thinking about going to Wing Stop, turn around and go to Teaks. Come on. You're already in the area, right?  Chill ambiance. Enjoy some peanuts and drop your shells on the floor if you please.   Great spot for a casual workweek lunch, live music on the weekend, or just catching a game.   Plenty of beers on tap for everyone's taste.  I haven't ventured much beyond the wings, but with good reason: They're delicious!  Two of my favorites are classic Hot, Suicide. Plenty of sauce and finished just crispy enough.  Don't forget to check out their unique wing combinations! The Jess Jess is a combo of their Medium sauce and BLEU CHEESE cooked into the wings. And it will blow.your.mind.   Since I carry the "Yelp Torch" in our relationship, Dude approves of this place.   Not so sure if it's the wings, or the t-shirts with the Teakwoods Moose you can purchase that say, "Nice rack!" but know we'll be back -  Wings for sure; maybe I'll finally buy one of the shirts.  Check out Teakwoods on your quest for great wings in Chandler.

Romancing the Bean: Too cute . . . Name and the place alike!  If I worked in this area, I'd be in BIG trouble.   Dine in service or To-go available here; obviously this is about a To-go experience.   Was in an all-day class in the Microsoft Office suite, and came down here on one of the breaks for some coffee.   Ended up walking out with their Daily Roast aka one strong cup o' Joe, plus one of the most amazing blueberry scones I've ever tasted!   Just the right amount of sweet, browned perfectly on the outside but still a soft on the inside. Nothing like those Crisco Bomb "scones" plaguing Starbucks pastry cases nationwide.   Did I mention this was all for $3.88?   Taylor was the cashier and she provided friendly and speedy service during the morning rush.   If you work over here, it'd be a mistake to not check out Romancing the Bean for some coffee, breakfast or lunch.   Know I'll be back when visiting clients in this part of Tempe!

I've noticed Back East Bagels for years while getting coffee at Xtreme Bean across the street, and finally made it in the day after Halloween.   This place was rockin'. Cyclists dropping in for a post-ride bagel and coffee, folks about to do their shopping at Sprouts, ASU students still in trashy Halloween costumes + make-up from the night before.  I only tried a Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with their seasonal Pumpkin Cream Cheese.  Friendly and quick service from the employees, even though the store was totally packed.  The bagel wasn't the size of a Chihuahua, but not the size of drink coaster either. Just right.   It was still piping hot when I got home, toasted perfectly while still being chewy, and believe it or not, the Pumpkin Cream Cheese with the perfect compliment to Cinnamon Raisin.   Wish these guys sold that stuff by the tub!   Never lived on the East Coast, never even visited, so I don't know what constitutes a bagel from there.   But I do know a good bagel when I bite into one, and this was it!

An updated and gleaming Fry's Marketplace in Tempe!  Last night, I found myself needing a few things to complete a homemade baked goods basket for the people at my PT clinic. This was on my drive home from the other side of town, so I dropped in.   This is a Marketplace so they have lots of kitchen / home goods / patio furniture in addition to your typical grocery items and household products.  The wine selection is pretty expansive here, too.   At checkout, there was a bagger named Chris (special needs guy it seemed - I am NOT saying that in a derogatory way, people).   While Amber the cashier was scanning my vanilla extract and cupcake liners, he kept telling me about his girlfriends and how he was the "man with the plan". And of course, the obligatory "THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT FRYS!"   Chris was hilarious; thanks for making my night! :)

The iced toddy is FANTASTIC -  It packs a punch, so no need to add extra shots to this one! If frou-frou coffee is more your thing, the espresso and blended drinks are all great too.   Also, love that this place is open 24 hours on the weekend. Those weekends that I find myself needing to get some work done, Xtreme Bean is a welcomed escape from my house.   Only downside is, it tends to get super busy on Sundays with ASU undergrads majoring in "Facebook" and gossip hour. Good luck finding an outlet for your laptop, and bring some headphones if you want to get anything done. :)

True Story: I will drive 5 miles past the nearest Circle jerK location to get to a Quik Trip.   I am the freaking Duchess of this location after all.   And maybe a few others. Sshhhhhhhh!  No matter the location, I've always found the place to be clean (restrooms included), friendly employees and an AWESOME drink selection. Hellooooooo, Black Mango Tea! And if I'm in a hurry, I know I'll be in and out lickity split.   Like this morning when I left my oatmeal packet on the counter and needed breakfast, fast.   There's also almost any food you could possibly want if you're in a pinch: Salads, sandwiches, fruit and oatmeal cups, you name it.   And for a convenience store, the donuts are A-ok!   Of course you can fuel up your ride here.  Basically, these guys kick the crap out of the competition any day.   Love ya, QT! xoxo

OK, I really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars. Been coming here for years. Affordable and delicious! Especially love the Spicy Hunan Sauce. Always have had a great experience.  Today, I went to this location with two of my coworkers. One of them has severe peanut and seafood allergies.   The staff was very accomodating at first: They gave her an "Allergy Warning" tag and instructed her which sauces to steer clear of (a previous reviewer mentioned that some of YC's sauces have fish stock in them).   Once we got to the grill where your bowl is cooked was where trouble hit. One of the two gentlemen said, in Spanish, "Just cook it on this used one. And play dumb like you don't understand them!"   Beyond inappropriate and dangerous!   Unfortunately for these clowns, two out of the three "snowflakes" speak Spanish and we called them on it.  They were very cautious after this, but it still left a bad taste in our mouths.   Will I come back? Likely, 'cause . . .  1) I'm a sucka,  2) LOVE stir fry, and  3) It's close to my house.   Bottom line: If you have allergies, WATCH OUT!

This isn't so much about the Walgreens itself as it is the customer service.  Last Monday, I THOUGHT I had left an important check at this location. Panicked, I called the store.   Wish I remember the gentleman's name I spoke with, but he told me he was going to have the manager review the cameras right away and call me.  Fortunately, it was just a "dee dee dee!" moment and the envelope was still in my car.   Thanks for providing SUPERIOR customer service, guys! :)

My friend, boyfriend and I decided to go for Ladies Night + Karaoke. Boyfriend was our designated driver for the evening, so why the hell not? You can't beat $2.50 drinks  (which were awesome . . . one thing this place got RIGHT!) and drunk singing with your girls. We THOUGHT it would be a good time . . .   So many things wrong with this place. It's as DIVE-y as it gets! But hey, like Vikram A. said . . . just look at the area.   The "karaoke regulars" were screaming all kinds of stuff at my friend and I like, "OH EM GEEEEEEEEEEEEE I sing it better, bitch!" or that we sucked. Classy . . . because your rendition of Katy Perry's "E.T" or whatever it's called was American Idol material  *eyeroll*   IT'S  KARAOKE, DON'T TAKE YOURSELF SO DAMN SERIOUSLY! But since we're playing that game: You suck at singing yourself. You're just a cheap knock-off of Katy Perry . . . I'll check you at the factory outlet, sweetheart. ;)   The bathrooms felt and looked like a scene out of Zombieland. When I walked into the stall I was waiting for someone/something to come under the door and stab me.  Also, our waitress (wish I remembered her name, the one with her bra hanging out) was pretty much screwing around the entire night with her friends. When she got off work, she tabbed us out (without us asking) and said, "I have to leave now, but you can keep drinking 'til 2AM!" Then proceeded to go drink and screw around with her friends more, just like she did while on the clock.   I think that ^ was the nail in the coffin. When you can't "delight" your customers in the service industry, expect them to vote with their feet.   If you're looking for an AWESOME Karaoke experience, try Darkhorse on Ray and Rural in Chandler. Great karaoke selection, friendlier clientele / staff, and less trashy for sure.  Note 6/17/2015: To the trolls sending me messages and "compliments" informing me that this is a dive bar: I'm well aware, honey. This just isn't my kind of dive. We all have our opinions ... Sorry you have nothing better to do with your "Yelp-Time".

I've been meaning to try Rock Springs Cafe for their World Famous Pies for years now on my trips to Flagstaff or Sedona.   Last Sunday after our weekend of off roading, hiking and winery adventures, Dude and I decided to swing by for a slice of that supposedly amazing pie - Jack Daniels Pecan Pie as specifically mentioned by some of our pals!   When we got in, the store had all of your typical Southwest souvenirs, a variety of jams, candies and other cooking goods.   We saw the place to queue up for slices of pie.   And man, I have to say the attitudes of the team here could use a major facelift.   Getting snappy with customers asking basic questions about your product? Wow!   Also, the attire of some of these gals was awful sloppy. I don't say this to be superficial or petty, but a proper fitting shirt that covers your midsection goes a long way in a customer-facing role. Have a little pride in your appearance!   Anyway, at that point we were happy to pay and hit the road home.   Once we finally tore into the pie, I was highly unimpressed. The pecan pie filling was unremarkable, and despite following Jason B.'s advice on waiting for that subtle JD taste after you swallow ... I just couldn't detect any. But the crust was quite excellent!   My Mom said we should have stuck to the Lemon Meringue and Blueberry Pies.   Good to know now, but based on the nasty customer service here and the unexciting pie, I won't be going out of my way to try it again. Perhaps on another trip up North.

Don't come to the Best Western Plus Phoenix Goodyear Inn expecting the Ritz-Carlton at Dove Mountain.   Dude and I booked through Expedia to stay here for one reason and one reason only: Avoid a DUI.    We went to Oktoberfest with some of my colleagues at the Airline Training Center of Arizona (Lufthansa) and German Air Force Base across the street.   I've stayed at Best Westerns in the past, and have had good experiences.   The price was fairly reasonable - and again, we were NOT expecting luxury - However, the crap smells emitting from bathtub drain throughout the room were competely unacceptable.   Didn't even bother with a shower, but it was still gross.   The room also wreaked of cigarette smoke.   Not my first choice for DUI avoidance in the future; we'll find another cheap hotel if we go party with our German buddies next year.

"I like to call Southwest Airlines the 'me first' airline. It's so awful!" - A lady who shall remain anonymous   Ha! OK. So I guess you like ...   1) Paying for checked bags? 2) Paying for perks that you didn't have to 10 years ago?  And quitcherbitchin' with the "Cattle Call" commentary. The check-in process isn't awful, and if it is, just be on the ball with checking in for your flight exactly 24 hours in advance. Psst, there's an app for that now!   Anywho! I freaking LOVE Southwest Airlines. Whether it's for work trips or play, they're my go-to for domestic travel.   Some highlights ...   1) They fly almost everywhere.  2) Rapid Rewards points stack up quickly between traveling, the RR Credit Card and Car Rentals.   3)Plus I almost always take enough flights per year to get A-List Priority boarding (25+)  - Usually only briefly at the end of the year; however, it's still pretty neat!   4) The new 737-800 series fleet is amazing. Extremely quiet, modern and there's Free WiFi on most flights now. Plus those cool lights overhead that change colors at different altitudes are pretty rad. *end aviation geek out*  5) Drink coupons in the mail are always a nice gift - Especially on return trips home!   6) Some of the friendliest crews around! Never met a grouchy crew member. Once when we got mad delayed in Orange County on a rather empty flight (after a really long day), the Pilots came back to chat with my coworkers and I while we waited. Nice guys!   Anyway, delays happen on any airline. Not just SWA. Smile and roll with it ...   See y'all on board real soon!

I normally go to the Chandler office of Endocrinology Associates, but needed to get in for my appointment a few days earlier.  The scheduler on the phone moved my appointment without a hitch.  The Scottsdale location is a VERY nice, modern, office.   Friendly front desk team and Crystal the MA (I know her from Chandler EA) is a doll.   I didn't see Susan this go around (ultrasound tech) but she's also amazing and makes getting your neck poked and prodded a little more tolerable!   I've been a patient of Dr. Amir Harari for almost four years now, and he's seriously the BEST physician I've encountered in my young life.   So much so that I wish it were possible to have this guy as my PCP!   I have highly recommended him to quite a number of friends and Yelpers now that have had horrible experiences with other Valley endocrinologists.  He really has a way of connecting with his patients, very patient with addressing any concerns and plans of action. You never feel like he's trying to bolt to the next patient or write off your symptoms.  Hey ladies, he might even heckle you about why your boyfriend hasn't proposed after FOREVER!  Plus not waiting 20 minutes beyond my original appointment time in three years? Yeah, the punctuality is more than appreciated!   Thankfully almost four years post thyroidectomy, my 1/2 thyroid has been behaving. Hopefully that continues. I will gladly come in once a year for a higher copay instead of my PCP.   If you need a stellar Endocrinologist for anything from managing your diabetes, thyroid disease or cancer, you're in good hands with Dr. Harari.  **Hey, PS, Doc ... I'm finally engaged. HAH! No more heckling? Or is this only the beginning with old married folks jokes?! ;)**

Meh. I was really looking forward to trying out Takamatsu. After all, it is right up the street from our house.   Dude and I joined Sarah R. and a large group (15-20, I think, many dropped in and out) here for her Sendoff Dinner.  Yes, the quality service tends to decline when larger groups are present. But what we experienced was downright unacceptable.  Really rude server. Mumbled and spoke too quietly and we seemed like a giant inconvenience to her.   Brought rolls to our table that belonged to no one in our party, and got visibly peeved (eye rolling, dirty looks, etc.) when one of us told her politely it wasn't ours.  Good luck getting water or utensils. Dude and I ended up just sharing a glass.   Trying to cash out or get a check was a nightmare. Another server approached our party and asked Dude and I if some rolls were ours. They need a better way to keep track of tickets.   Got to the point we walked up to the cashier, told him what we ordered and paid.  Also, another server on Sarah's end of the table got frustrated with a new guest to our party and RIPPED UP his sushi ordering sheet. In front of customers ... And was that really necessary?   We probably made a mistake ordering sushi at a Korean BBQ joint. But hey, sounded tasty!   Tried the Las Vegas, Tiger, Rainbow and Heart Attack Rolls.   Everything tasted the same. Way too much rice, thinly cut fish (to the point it looked like just the skins), and the breading on the Vegas Roll was bready and soggy. Like it had been sitting out a long time.   And don't even get me started on the culinary clusterphuk that was that Heart Attack Roll. Come on: Eel sauce + spicy cheese sauce + cream cheese + jalapeno pepper does not equal a palate pleaser.  I did; however, get to taste a piece of Sarah's spicy pork dish ... That was excellent!  The bright side to this place? We had a wonderful time enjoying the company of our friends, and Takamatsu was OK with me bringing a cake for Sarah.  Despite the dismal experience, I wanted to come back and try the Korean BBQ.   That is, until Dude got an epic case of food poisoning. Going on day two. And we're talking about a guy that almost never gets sick. Can count on one hand after nearly 9 years together how many times he's been sick.  Not worth $8.95/roll; sure as hell wasn't worth an 18% gratuity charge.   I'll stick to Shimogamo for delicious sushi that matches the price, and will be on the hunt for another Korean BBQ place.   Spare your digestive tract and avoid the sushi. Stick to BBQ if you go.

Can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review for La Stalla Cucina Rustica.  If you're looking for delicious Italian food that doesn't resemble the corporate garbage that's strewn about the area, then look no further!   Seriously, though, the food here reminds me of my Nana's cooking . . . And that's damn near impossible to compete with.   A quaint little spot for a date night in Downtown Chandler, yet affordable. Very charming décor inside. Yes, the paper table coverings are annoying and scream "MACARONI GRILL!", but that's the least of your worries when you come to a place like this.    Every time we go here, we always have the same server. Feeling like an idiot because I can't remember her name! She always recommends great wine for us, and is even generous enough to let us taste before committing to a bottle or glass. *Edit: Her name is Tina, and she is amazing!*  The last time I was in five or so months ago, found out that LSCR started making their own bread. Better than whatever they had before! Always comes out fresh, warm and fluffy. Have to get that thing out of sight after a piece it's that good.   The few times we've been here we've tried the Ravioli Di Patate Dolci Giapponesi Al Gorgonzola, Risotto Agli Scampi and Costolette D'Agnello alla Griglia,  and a Manicotti that was on special.   Everything was excellent; however, our absolute favorite was the first thing I listed: Japanese sweet potato ravioli in a Gorgonzola cheese cream sauce. WOW!   Definitely need a nap after this rich dish. Still haven't gotten around to recreating it at home. The sweet potato blended surprisingly well with something as rich as Gorgonzola.   If you want to do dessert, try the Chocolate Souffle. Hello, dark chocolate heaven! Make sure you give your server a heads up, as it takes 15 minutes for this one. Patience!   Great selection of after dinner drinks too. Think grappa and homemade limoncello!  The almond flavored grappa was awesome.  Brought back memories of visiting family in Varrazze years ago and being introduced to it by my Nana's cousin after a ridiculously indulgent meal. Yeah, smooth move dude . . . extra potent alcohol for a bunch of 18-20 year old WILD college kids!   Check it out. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, you're probably an Olive Garden fan. :)

Sorry guys, I just wasn't impressed with Long Wongs.  Dude and I were feeling like wings one evening after bowling, so we decided to stop in here and get some to go and see what the big whoop was.   We tried the Hot and Suicide flavors.   The wing sauces were way too salty, vinegary, and the wings were pretty bare meat wise.    Meh, I've experienced better indeed sums it up.

If you're going to Scottsdale Comedy Spot with expectations of Tempe Improv or Stand Up Live, park 'em and park 'em NOW.   I met homegirl extraordinaire Missy F. here for The Sic Sense's (our very own Brian "Nucks" N., y'all!) Holiday Show.   SCS is a cozy comedy venue right in the heart of Old Town.   Plenty of bars and restaurants in the area to make an evening of a show.   For around $10 + two drink minimum, you can get out for around $25-$30 a person.  Thankfully, I was driving and the Diet Cokes weren't too pricey.   No servers the night we were in, but walking back to the bar to get our drinks was no biggie.   Unique vibe at this place, and overall had a great time - Look forward to coming back!

Driving down this part of Hayden and away from Old Town Scottsdale, you wouldn't expect to find the treasure that is Carlsbad Tavern.  Can't tell you how many times I've drove past it on my work runs, promising I'd give it a go. Well, that someday was two weeks ago (a Friday night) and . . . Well . . . Mind has been blown!   The atmosphere here is refreshing coupled with attentive service. Maybe this is the margarita talking, but really did feel like I stepped into a cavern. Gorgeous patio surrounded by water and fountains, which is why we opted to sit out there.   Great for larger groups; also the perfect ambience for a summer date night. Emphasis on night, since we all know how hot it gets here.  Free chips and salsa when you check-in on Yelp. Was it that spicy? Nah. But it didn't TASTE like someone scooped it out of a jar. The green / tomatillo sauce was especially tangy. Also, the chips had some sort of seasoning on them which was a nice touch.   That Cruzan Pineapple Margarita? No bueno; he tenido mejor sin una carga de Triple Sec.   Tip: When you look at the menu, it gives you warnings about the spice levels. Unlike many restaurants around the Valley that employ this practice, they aren't joking, so prepare to eat once, enjoy twice if you don't heed them. Whoa, sorry, that was wholly inappropriate! :)   Also, if you're looking for Green Chile, you won't be disappointed. The menu has an entire section devoted to just that.   I had the Green Chile Burrito with Machaca; the Dude tried the Enchantment Platter. Woweeee! My ears were ringing all night after this. The Machaca wasn't tough, which was nice. Los Dos Molinos? Watch out, you've got some competition.   The Enchantment Platter had one of the best Chile Rellenos I've had that wasn't homemade by someone's Nana. Read: Not eggy or soggy.   Massive portions, took the other half home.    Gave the Sopas a try after reading Ursula D.'s review. Wow!!!!  Is it a true New Mexico experience? Not sure. But Carlsbad Tavern certainly delivered in the spicy "melt your face off" department!

I love a trip to Four Peaks! Been coming here for years now!   Delicious food, craft beers, enjoying the company of your friends ... What more could you ask for?   In the fall, I find myself here more often as that's when they bust out the Pumpkin Porter. It's even more delicious in a shake . . . Impossible?!   The Bleu Light Special Burger is my favorite burger on the menu. Get it with the beer battered fries; they're to die for.  I also love the Five Layer Nacho Dip with Chicken. Just make sure you bring an Army with you (four or more of your buds), because the portion size is ginormous.   The Brickhouse Wings are just OK.   Still need to try the legendary Salmon BLT!  Bring your growler - Trust me, you'll want to bring some beer home.   The only downside is, they can't fill growlers with Oatmeal Stout (love this one the most out of all their beers ) - something about it not keeping fresh. :(   Make sure you bring a DD. Drunk driving is for dumbasses who want to get tossed around Tent City like a box of Girl Scout Cookies.  Don't be deterred from a trip to Four Peaks because of all the ASU youngins - There's good times and even better brews to be had for (legal aged) folks young and old!

Truly, you can't "go wrong" with The Vine.   Affordable wings and huge beers -  And a fabulous selection at that!   Dude and I used to hang here in college (he's an ASU Alum) - And we were both happy to say it retained that look and feel.    Well, the bathrooms were much cleaner + painted now. No more "Call Brandon for a good time! (555) 555-5555" and random penis drawings scrawled everywhere.  Plus, one of the bartenders from 7-10 years ago  is still here!  There was also a wide variety of ages, from college kids to the late 20s/30s/early 40s crowd, so didn't feel too creepy.   Most recent adventure was after meeting my BFF's guy at Culinary Dropout.  The food we shared there, umm ... Totally sucked and  overhyped. Needless to say we were still pretty hungry, so made our way to the Vine - Wings are safe!  Happy to say the Hot flavored wings were still on point, and the Sriacha wings didn't disappoint.   Plus $2 PBR. Don't judge me.  Got out for $14 because our server comped Dude's Coke (DD). Not too shabby for a dozen wings and some Freshman year, "Slip your over 21 teammate a $20 for all the cheap beer you can find!" beer.  Now go forth and get up to some shenanigans, my friends!

OK, finally lost my Tempe Improv V-Card. Why it didn't happen sooner, the world will never know.  Either way, I went here for the first time over a week ago to see Carlos Mencia and got to surprise my Dude with a night out! We won tickets through My 103.9 FM. Thanks again, Miss Monti!   Not much else I can say that hasn't been said: Great venue for comedy, plenty of parking, and overall a fun time. No matter where you're sitting, you have a nice view of the comic.   Pleased to report that Tempe Improv addresses jackassery and hecklers in a prompt manner, even if Carlos was cool with this crazy guy in the VIP section just "Having a good time!"   Also, they have speakers in their restrooms that pump in audio from the show so you don't miss a beat. Yes, "Miss Hamster Bladder" (damn you, Dude) had to get up during Carlos' encore!   Two drink minimum is per person. We decided to stick to beers. Bucket of four (Two Blue Moon + Two Coors Light) went for around $25-$27. Gratuity included.   I think we got out quite fine for only sticking to drinks; however, I think this place would be even better if they put their beers on draft to match the price.   Our server did a fantastic job of checking in on us, which was awesome since we only had drinks.   Can't wait to come back!

Been a member since 2003, originally at Ahwatukee Foothills.   As an athlete (post collegiate hammer thrower, OH YEAH!) I train at Crossfit 347. However, since I can only manage driving out there 3 days as week, it's convenient to have a membership for those days  I'm done throwing in Mesa and need to get a workout in.   Very friendly, unintimidating atmosphere. Someone always greets you. Ryan Aslan, one of the personal trainers is a pretty cool guy, and will stop by to catch up with everyone.  Great for families and free childcare. They have locker rooms, but you need to bring your own lock.     There's a nice variety of Group Fitness classes available. Favorites are Zumba class with Liz and Kimberly on Monday (5:30PM), Wednesday (4:30PM) and Saturday (8AM). Heidi also teaches a great Cycle class.   Plenty of machines for all you cardio junkies out there!   Oh, that weight room . . .   True, this is a "normal people" gym so don't expect to see any bumper plates, quality barbells or platforms for the Olympic Lifts. No big, my coach has me modify or go lighter with higher reps.   One squat rack always equals a wait. Like any typical gym, you'll see dudes doing CURLS on the squat rack and neglecting their legs. Too funny.   Love that there's an auxiliary room for conditioning work. Thanks for having lots of jump ropes and KETTLE BELLS; how awesome is that?!   Unlike other Valley YMCA locations, there seems to be less girl-on-girl cattiness. If it's happening I'm too busy working out to notice, but yeah. You won't even see Stepford Wives all decked out in Lulu Lemon, the entire MAC counter on their faces and NOT breaking a sweat here. Everyone's there to workout and get stuff done.   Sure, I've had a couple douchebros make offensive comments within earshot about me being the only female lifting . . . and lifting HEAVY!   Being feminine and strong aren't mutually exclusive events. Duh. ;)    Recommended!

If you're in the mood for great Asian food, Tott's will satisfy that craving!   Dude and his roommate used to live nearby, and this was one of their college staples. How I never went here before this year, the world will never know.   Both times were take-out, never dined in.   So far, we've tried . . .   1) Orange Chicken  2) Dan Dan Noodles with Beef 3) Kung Pao Chicken Stir Fry   The Orange Chicken is great. Much better than Panda Express, but that's no surprise. However, for those saying this is Chandler's best Orange Chicken? Sorry kids, but that title is reserved for Tokyo House's Orange Chicken on Alma School and Warner. It will blow.your.mind!   The Kung Pao Chicken Stir Fry could have been a little spicier.   The Dan Dan Noodles are perfect! Tender beef, and just the right amount of spice in the garlic bean sauce. Always ask for some extra cucumber.   In all, this place rocks! Tott's is now on our list of go-to Chandler Asian establishments.

I really wanted to like Taqueria Mi Casita, but it just wasn't very good.  The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and it was nice to see them interacting with regulars and newbies alike.   Ordered a Carne Asada burrito, and this sucker was PACKED full.   Unlike typical Carne, this was finely chopped beef vs. chunks.  No big deal. What was a big deal is all I could taste was salt. :(   Haven't been in a hurry to go back and see if this was a fluke, but definitely willing to give them a second chance per some recommendations Claudine F. made!

Good ol' Oregano's!   This place is conveniently located across the street from Mesa Community College where I train.   Met up with Missy F., Andrew C. and Sarah R. here after practice one night. Wreaking of sweat and dirt from the hammer ring, we opted to sit out on the patio. Oh, and it wasn't too hot outside . . . an Arizona rarity in August.   Our server Kurt was friendly and attentive.   We had the aptly named Oregano's favorite salad to start. Crispy romaine lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, a sprinkle of feta, red onions, pine nuts, and raisins. And don't forget that honey vinaigrette dressing. Light and refreshing.   We got the junior size. Worked out perfectly for a group of four, which was a surprise when you get a bunch of hungry Power Athletes together after training.   On Kurt's recommendation, we ordered the thin-crust, medium sized Clark Street Meat Pizza. If you're a meat lover, get this one. It's got a generous helping of Chicago sausage, capicolla, salami, capped off with fresh basil, garlic and chili flakes.   This was outside of my normal Oregano's repertoire, and not a huge "Meat Lovers" pizza fan to begin with . . . Yet . . . It was friggin' delicious!   NOT getting a Pizza Cookie after is an Oregano's sin. Just share!   All Oregano's are consistently delicious, but I think what made our trip was Kurt. He was a really fun guy to talk to (Jean Twenge's books, NOT becoming a smug married/ having kids in your late twenties just because society says so, etc.) and understands the meaning of a delighted customer.   We'll be back, Kurt - Let us know if you enjoyed the book recommendation!

Quiet place; great for working . . . Unless you need Internet for your job. Then you must contend with their unbelieveably slow WIFI.   The Mexican Mocha is delish!

**EDIT: UMMMM apparently they were only closed for a week?!?! SOOOOOOO glad this is back! :)**  Gelato 64 closed up in January or February. Sad day in Chandler, but my jeans are likely thanking me!   Know there's a Gilbert location, and a little bird told me they'll be opening up shop on Arizona Avenue. Hope that's true!   Always creative flavors, everything from the fruity to the chocolatey decadent flavors. Yeah, whose idea was it to make a BLACKBERRY MERLOT Gelato?! So good. This wino appreciates it :) Death by Chocolate is something else.   And let's not forget all those holiday flavors like Pumpkin Pie, Peppermint Stick, etc.  Staff was always very friendly; happy to make suggestions and more than willing to hook you up with samples.

With 1,079 reviews (and counting) and a 4.5 star rating, I'm not sure what else can be said about the Cornish Pasty Company.   The food is always delicious, almost any beer you could want is a flowin', service is excellent and the atmosphere is on point.   Back in March one of my childhood buddies was visiting from Boston, and we hosted a Homecoming/Reunion party for him here.   I have to hand it to the staff for how well they handled our wild, crazy, LOUD group of 15+. Our drinks were never empty and I can't recall any hiccups on anyone's orders.   Also, on this visit, I finally shared some Banoffee Pie with Greg G.  Ho Lee Fook AMAZING. Why did I wait so long to try it?! Graham cracker, caramel coated crust with pillowy whipped cream and banana slices.   If Greg and I hadn't known each other for almost 20 years, I may have fought him to the death for the whole thing!  Any place I can get out for well under $30 after a filling entree (Lamb Vindaloo Pasty is my fave!) + two pints of Raj IPA is a winner in my book.  Don't ever change, CPC!

It's true : Having grown up in California, I love me some In-N-Out!  It's definitely over hyped, but the food is consistently delicious. They do the best job of lettuce wrapping burgers around, make that animal style with my fries done extra crispy.   They pay and treat their employees much better than their industry counterparts, which explains the fabulous customer service.   Haha, give me a break, it's almost non existent ... At least at this location recently.   Seeing as this In-N-Out is by my office, it's convenient and I used to come here often when I was a young, dumb fool that thought it was OK to go out for lunch daily. I never remember having problems with my food or the employees.   Dropped in here last Sunday to grab a #2 to go: Animal Style, Protein Style, Extra Crispy Fries.  Kayla the cashier was beyond rude and made it visibly known that taking my or anyone else's order was a complete inconvenience to her.   I asked twice to make sure she noted Protein Style. Dirty looks and a yes. Practically threw my card and receipt back at me.   When I looked at my receipt, I saw it wasn't listed. Kevin calls me up to grab my order, and I asked if this was done Protein Style. He said no but would happily remedy this.   Usually Four stars for the food. Four stars for Kevin, ZERO stars for Kayla.   I don't come here very much, but I will likely stick to the In-N-Out on Chandler and Price from here on out when I decide to indulge.  Sorry for the two star rating, In-N-Out, but maybe you should consider removing this superbrat from a customer facing position or not hiring these types all together.

Man, do I regret not trying Yupha's sooner!   Dude and I have lived almost walking distance from here for nearly two years and we finally stopped in last weekend.   Yupha's is super deceptive if you judge it from the outside only. I was expecting a Chinese take out (think Hot Wok Mr Cook) type of place, but WOW!   Very beautiful, aesthetically pleasing decor. Given how many people were in on a Saturday night, it wasn't overly loud like I was anticipating. Just the right ambiance for a date night.   We were seated immediately, and once we had a chance to check out the menu, our server came by to take our order.   We ordered the almost obligatory Thai Iced Tea, Drunken Noodles with Beef and Red Curry with Chicken - Both Thai Hot.   The Thai Iced Tea wasn't anything spectacular.   Red Curry was the perfect balance of meat and vegetables. They did not skimp on the chicken and it was cooked just right.   I really enjoyed the Drunken Noodles. Also very generous with the steak and vegetables. The noodles weren't dried up like the last Thai place we went to.   I will say though with the spice levels, we'll go double or triple Thai Hot as single Thai Hot was more on the higher side of medium for our spice tastes.   Both dishes were more than enough for two people and we had leftovers to take home.  Overall, friendly service, fresh, delicious food, in the neighborhood ... Will definitely be back when a craving for Thai strikes!

My favorite place to get a cold one and wings with friends when paying Ahwatukee a visit. $2.50 Blue Moon Saturdays, anyone? They always have fantastic drink specials basically every night of the week.   The live music line up is just . . . meeehhhhhhhhh. But it sure is amusing to watch the Stepford Wives of the 'Tuke try sooooo hard get their dance on in their 16-year-old's clothing when you're hammered. :)  UPDATE 12/11/2012:  Blue Moon is now $2.75 . . . still a great deal!

I know this store's HORRIBLE in terms of clothing - Can you say shoddily made, thin materials, lack of consistency in sizing? But do you have to be equally horrible in your customer service practices?  That in mind, I only really come into this store when I need an accessory and don't feel like paying a lot for it.  Back in August after my partial thyroidectomy + mass removal - AND while waiting for the final pathology report to come back,  I needed a light scarf that was plain black I could use to cover my bloody neck incision while the swelling dies down. There's nothing like some guy gawking and screaming, "AHH LOOK, A ZOMBIE!" at you when you're shopping at Frys to make you feel self-conscious.  So I ventured into this Forever 21, and couldn't find one. I approached a teenage looking CSR.   "Excuse me, do you know if you have any other - *gets cut off*"   "*eye rolling* I'M SORRY BUT I'M OFF THE CLOCK, I NEED TO PUNCH OUT LYK OMG YOU BITCH HOW DARE YOU *walks away*!"   Infuriated, I got in the 5-mile-line that was the back to school rush. I asked to speak to the manager. Wish I remembered her name, because she was just as useless as the CSR. Was either too busy farting around with a friend or another customer to truly listen to what I had to say. Granted, I was a little out of control. But still unacceptable.   1. "I'm really sorry, I'll have _______ help you out!"  - Nope, that's OK.   2. "I don't think she's here today." - I WAS TALKING ABOUT LITERALLY SECONDS AGO, M'AM!    I think Forever 21 as a whole, not just this store, missed this fundamental lesson:  Rule #1 of Customer Service: There is no cure for a poor experience.  Rule #2 of Customer Service: There is no cure for sucking.  Rule #3: You MUST provide a GREAT Customer Service Experience . . . or someone ELSE will!   Needless to say, I will NOT be back. Ever. Obviously, there are places with higher quality clothes, and their customer service is / can be superior.   Just. Don't. Go. Here.

Advisory for all new college grads working in this area:   So, you thought the "Freshman 15" was horrible? Well, prepare to meet its not-so-distant cousin, the "Cubicle Cincuenta" if . . .  1) You have a sedentary job  2) Said sedentary job is nearby The Barbecue Company (The BBQ Co)  My work was in this area three years ago, and I know I packed a bit on. Chalk that up to taking two years off from Track & Field.   It's not the best barbeque you will ever taste, but it makes for a delicious lunch. My coworkers and I would go WAY too much. Everyone leaves happy.     Some of my favorites . . .   1) The Texas Twister: Brisket with barbeque sauce capped with fried onion strings 2) Classic Pulled Pork Sandwich  3) Q-Spud: Behemoth loaded baked potato with your choice of meat  4) Caesar Salad with the Salsalita Chicken   As far as sides go, don't miss out on the Kentucky Blue Cheese Slaw. Seasoned fries here are just OK. Sorry, no alcohol is served for all you lushes out there looking for a pint or three.   Always friendly service; the ladies here got to know everyone in our office by name. Oh wait, not sure if that's a good thing . . . Someone get us into The BBQ Co Addicts Anonymous.   Hit up their website for Barbeque Bucks. Have to spend a minimum of $5. Don't forget that punch card, either!   If I recall, the first Wednesday of the month they do a BBQ Buffet. Never partook, but looked ridiculous.   Tip: NOT open on weekends.   If you don't mind your jeans screaming in protest a la cutting into your skin from all the calorie-laden goodness, hit up The BBQ Co for a workweek lunch sometime!

Fair Trade Cafe is a nifty coffee house on the corner of Central and Roosevelt.   Conveniently located near the light rail, so it's easy to access.   Unless you're like me and drove in from the Southeast Valley and in true herp-a-durp fashion managed to miss the parking garage . . . Almost twice. Don't judge!   Cozy up in one of their chairs, community tables or sit outside on the back patio near the fountain. You won't feel rushed at all.   If my workplace was in the vicinity, I could totally see myself hiding out here to shake things up occasionally.  Met Amy K. here for friend catch up time / coffee / breakfast this morning.   I got a cup of the dark roast. Hot, strong and brunette is the way I go! No almond milk today. This was one amazingly fresh cup o' joe. Nice and smooth, not a whole lot of bitter.   We also got breakfast; hearty slices of bacon and perfectly fluffy scrambled eggs.   Not sure what the damage was on all of this as I was being treated (THANK YOU SO MUCH AMY!), but $2.25 - $2.50 is your typical drip coffee price.   Didn't get a chance to see if they sold beans here, but I know I'll be back whenever I'm in the area.   Thanks Amy for introducing me to a new place!

No one likes dropping money on tires (or anything car related), but when you must do so, hit up Discount Tire.   I had a tire blowout on Monday and ended up having to replace both of my rear tires.   Hector was able to book an appointment for me right after work yesterday, and he even ordered the brand I needed from another shop. Pretty awesome!   Barely took them an hour for the install. Not even sure why I headed home, because it seemed like DT called me as soon as I walked in the door!   Plus you can't beat that lifetime warranty plus free tire rotation.   Hopefully I won't have to do this for a long time, but will trust DT for my tire needs in the future.

You know, sometimes going to Costco can feel like going to Wal-Mart at peak hours on Sunday, but in the end it's worth it.  Where else can you buy almost a year's supply of:   - Toilet Paper - Paper Towels  - Trash Bags  - Olive Oil  - Tampax  - Razor Cartridges - Laundry Detergent  - Cleaning Supplies   Basically, anything you can possibly need you will likely find in this little slice of warehouse heaven.  Being that it's just me and Dude, I don't buy much in bulk, but for the things that make sense for us to do so, Costco es clutch!  Even found an AMAZING 8 foot Live Christmas Tree for $40 last year. Yes!  The self-scanner is a godsend. Grab a scanner, scan the items in your cart, pay at the self checkout and be on your merry way.  Also, another benefit to membership is the Costco Fuel Station. Best prices in town, and I always feel like I'm "Doin' it wrong!" if I fill the tank anywhere else.   Don't forget to grab an amazing pizza slice or churro on your way out.    - 1 star for only taking AmEx credit cards. *fail horn*  Now if only I could get out without spending over $100, that would be fantastic!

Thanks to Jamie and the team at Classy Closets, my boyfriend and I have a beautiful, clutter-free closet. And, no drama in our house about clothes laying around where they shouldn't be! :)   Everything from getting a quote, the actual install, and the customer service follow-up to a minor issue I had was splendid.   A bar / shelf was installed over the cover of our network center / home server. Thankfully, Classy Closets promptly sent Jamie back out BEFORE we moved into our new home to remove it.

Came in here on a Tuesday afternoon in between meetings with clients.   The Extra Hot Golden Wings were amazing! Not your typical buffalo wing flavor at all. Tangy, yet very spicy. Came out nice and crispy.   It looked like Zipps had some great happy hour specials, so definitely will have to come back with friends one of these nights.

This used to be my "Walgreens of Choice" when I lived in the area back in the day.   It's near work, so I'll still drop in every now and then if I need anything.  This location is 24 hours and conveniently located in the center of Ahwatukee.  It was recently-ish remodeled, and wow! When compared to a few years ago, the new look of the interior is night and day. The whole store seems much more spacious without display, dividers, etc. towering overhead.  The aisles are brightly lit, clean and organized .    The pharmacy now has a walk-in clinic ran by PAs and NPs, a testing lab and a variety of vaccinations available.  What's cool about this Walgreens is instead of overhead pages when your scrip is ready, you can simply look up at a screen to check the status (in process, ready).   Today I dropped in for my flu shot, seeing as my physical with my PCP got pushed back to October.  With some awesome health conditions that make bounding back from the flu a real pain in the ass, no way was I going to wait that long. Or giving anyone a copay for something insurance covers.   Quick, 15 minute in and out experience from the time my insurance was ran / forms signed to the pharmacist stabbing my arm.   Would get my flu shot here next year if I'm in a bind. Or just for some dark chocolate covered acai berries ... Hah!

VERY efficient medical practice, and great surgeons!   Last summer, I had to have half of my thryoid removed along with a very large benign mass.   I wasn't about to settle for a general surgeon to do the job. My endocrinologist referred me to Dr. Glenn Rothman at AOC Mesa.   If I recall, he said he did 8+ thyroidectomies a week and is the head of Head and Neck Cancer Surgery at Banner Desert.   Dr. Rothman explained everything clearly, answered all questions me or my family had, and was great every step of the way, from the initial consultation to post-surgical follow-up.  A lot of people are turned off by Dr. Rothman's "tell it like it is" approach and say it's poor bedside manner. PLEASE DON'T BE! Talk to other physicians; this is the go to guy.   Look at it this way: Would you rather have a surgeon with mediocre skill that gives you the "warm fuzzies", or a straight shooter who gets down to business, diagnoses your condition accurately, and cuts beautifully? I'll choose skill . . . everytime!  Absolutely no complications with this surgery and very minimal pain - only needed pain medication the first day I left Banner Desert.    Lastly, check out the picture I've added for this business. The left side is my neck shortly after the procedure, the right one is three months after. Can you find the scar? It's pretty much invisible. :)   Recommended for sure!

So, you're in need of a gift for someone special eh?  Definitely hit up Urbayn in the Casa Paloma shopping center.   I've found everything here, gifts for bachelorette parties, gaudy drinkware for 21st birthdays, heck I even found an adorable mother's day gift for my Mom one year!   Love all the painted wine glasses and other wine-related gifts for the wino in your life.  If you're puzzled where to begin, the staff is friendly and more than willing to help you out.   Don't be afraid to ask for help! Urbayn is a fun shop.

Throughout therapy, Ben dropped plenty of remarks about how OL is horrible for the joints, how horrible my body structure was and a handful of other somewhat degrading remarks. Trust me, I know how horrible it is for the joints every time I stand up, hah.   A note to ALL PTs: Those of us that get enjoyment out of power sports - Heck, I'll even stand up for CrossFit - We KNOW how "bad" it is and the consequences that await us. Please do not lecture us or write us off as legitimate athletes.   One day, he even said, "I really don't know what else to do for you."  Incredibly frustrated to the point of tears (that never happens to me), I asked where he proposed we go from here - I was legitimately trying to get better after all.   "Continue out another month of rehab sessions with me, then go get a Cortisone shot with Justin because I don't know what else to do for you."  What?! You don't know what to do, yet you're happy to continue taking my money instead of referring me to a colleague that might be able to help?   Totally unprofessional. I can handle brutal honesty, I'm a big girl. But when your behavior goes from honesty to assoholic behavior, you've crossed a line.   Should have walked out then and there, but I was stupid enough to come back for one last appointment.   At that appointment, Ben's NAU Student PT noticed a lot of tension(?) along my gastrocnemius. I made a comment that my previous PT (no longer in practice) had done dry needling in that area for my other knee a few years ago.  What does Ben say?   "That's next in my plan, dry needling."   *record scratching* Whoa, bud, last week you said you didn't know what else to do ... Where did this come from?!  It was then I was 100% confident in my decision to leave the practice and take my business elsewhere.   So basically I left $500+ broker.   Another thing I must mention, the record keeping skills at this clinic are concerning.  When I requested my records be sent to the next PT, I also requested them for my own review to ensure they were accurate.   In my photos attached to this review, you will see that Ben noted I had a Medial Menisectomy on my Left Knee.   Uhh, unless aliens came down and stole it ... That surgery NEVER happened.   It's possible Ben confused that with the Radical Nephrectomy I had (total removal of a kidney), but that also wasn't notated in my surgical history.  So we'll give him the benefit of the doubt there, but you should know this should you decide to entrust FSMSG with your rehab needs.  More "Highlights"  1. HORRIBLE technicians   Almost everyone I encountered was more concerned about getting off work, having a "case of the Fridays" or something else. My last appointment, I needed some assistance with an exercise--Check out the picture of these clowns gathered around the podium instead of working.  I'm pretty sure one gal BS-ed my chart so she could get to the poolside to get sloshed faster.   If Foothills ran the Q12 Employee Engagement Metric on all their technicians at every clinic, I'd bet money 99% of these folks are actively disengaged with their work.   Astrid and Brandon (Nursing and PT bound students) were exceptions. There was no doubt that they're actively engaged with their patients, a pleasure to work with and have a bright future ahead of them.  Those two are a big reason this is a two star review instead of one.   2. Soliciting Yelp Reviews   See my picture. It's a bad idea to hang a sign in your clinic soliciting Yelp reviews per the TOS. Ever wonder why all your positive reviews are ending up in the filter?   3. Rude front desk staff  With the exception of a few ladies, some of them couldn't be bothered to greet patients let alone look us in the eye when oh, you know, taking our hard earned money?  4. Cell phones GALORE   I've never been in a physical therapy clinic where this was permitted. Lots of patients messing around on their phones during treatment, but hey - They were probably just mimicking the behavior of the professional staff here too busy messing around here to help!   To sum it up, I have never felt so uncomfortable and even embarrassed in what's supposed to be a professional health care setting.   Being off for six months with this injury was hard enough--I did not compete at USAW Nationals in August and will not be competing in the American Open in a few weeks.   Ben's behavior was a major blow to my self-worth and confidence at an already vulnerable time.   Please don't repeat my experience.   That being said, if you're a serious athlete, please go somewhere else. You will NOT be treated with any level of respect.  Maybe this kind of rehab is good for your average person, but athletes, run to another PT Clinic as fast as you can.   Patient Care is NOT a priority here--Just chasing that paper.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: The updated review is Part One. Please read the previous review for Part Two**  I had to hold off on my review of Foothills Sports Medicine South Gilbert (FSMSG) for almost 5 months in order to be as civil as possible.  Where to begin with this physical therapy experience I'd rather forget?  Some background: I'm a competitive Olympic Weightlifter (OL) (69k-75k), and spent over 10 years competing in Track and Field (Hammer Throw - NCAA DI and post-collegiately).   In April, I managed to bang up my left knee pretty good; the medial meniscus + contused the femur from overuse and heavy training.  Justin Wilcox and Dr. Cummings at TOCA have NEVER let me down with a rehab referral, so when they referred me to Ben Hagar at this facility, I was ready to get to work--Competitive lifting / fitness in general are important aspects of my lifestyle I refuse to compromise on.    So important, that I made a 15 mile trip each way to the clinic, sometimes even further depending on where I ended my workday in the Valley that particular day.  My first appointment with Ben, I was very optimistic. He did the typical battery of evaluation and tests, went into great detail explaining my injury and the plan of action, and took the time to ask questions about me as a person and athlete. We both lived in Reno at one point in our lives; he was also a college athlete. Cool. Relatable.   The rehab program I was presented (both in-clinic and daily at home) with set off a few alarm bells in my head.   Now, obviously I am NOT a PT by any means, but I've had rehab for knee injuries in the past, and that rehab was much more active.   Active as in doing exercises with some level of resistance, things that mimicked the movement patterns of the sport or would otherwise be beneficial to recovery.  Not laying on my back for 98% of my exercises.  The fact the rehab room was a room full of treatment tables only (no other equipment) should have been a sign for me to run far, FAR away.   But I kept an open mind, believed in what Ben was trying to accomplish and faithfully completed my exercises in the clinic and at home.   Plus, I was starting to get a small amount of relief with Ben's manual work and McConnell taping.   He even noticed my big toes were lifting off the ground when I got into a squat, which has been incredibly helpful to me to this day.  As time went on, I got the feeling that I was a waste of Ben's time and he was annoyed by my business, and me as a person.

The Dude says that DSW is a French word for "Men's Hell".   I call DSW "shoe porn" Heaven.   . . . So I just go by myself. ;)   You can find all those lovely designer shoes for a good percentage off what you'd pay in other stores.   And don't forget that clearance rack. I've found $150+ Guess wedges and other beautiful shoes for $50 and UNDER. Fantastic condition, too.  Friendly, helpful associates. Don't hesitate to ask for help. I had one lady pull a different size for me on an awesome pair of Kelly and Katie flats that weren't available on the floor.   Make sure you're a rewards member, because those triple points come in handy. And that ever coveted birthday coupon!   Enter at your own risk. No jokes.

To be honest, I'm an extremely low-maintenance gal when it comes to make-up. 98% of the time I only use mascara, brow filler and a tinted lip gloss. Really want to get dolled up? I'll bust out the Bare Minerals and Urban Decay NAKED Palette.   Enter Sephora. This store has everything you could ever need or want to try - it's introduced me to so many new products and brands! I love that unlike ULTA, the employees actually seem interested in customers and are knowledgeable about their products.   You can take samples home of just about anything! Good to know before you invest in something like a face or eye primer.   Become a Sephora Beauty Insider. This will put you on their mailing list, get you coupons, offers, etc. This year's birthday gift has got me hooked on Benefit's "They're Real!" Mascara.   Oh, and for those Bare Minerals / Bare Escentuals junkies out there: This is the only STORE where you can purchase anything from their BUXOM line. Big and Healthy Lip Polish, anyone? You won't find it at ULTA; you won't even find it at the BM Boutique upstairs at this mall!

Love Love Love Ann Taylor LOFT! Step into my closet, and you'll probably see more than a handful of LOFT tags on the rack.   This store is great for business casual clothing and your everyday threads. Flattering fits (petite included), quality apparel, trendy-yet-classic styles and darling dresses are the things that keep me coming back time and time again.   At the same time, it's hit or miss.   Is LOFT apparel a bit on the pricey side? Absolutely. But go into the Ann Taylor store a few shops down, and you'll come running back as if someone were chasing you with a Taser.   On that note, once you become a LOFT Insider (e-mail) you will find that they hold some serious sales on the regular. Forty percent off and higher. If you plan your trips right, you can come away with some steals. There's also a credit card with rewards. Personally, haven't opened one. And probably won't.   Sales Associates are genuinely sweet ladies and never pushy on getting you to purchase anything. More than helpful if you ever need input on how an ensemble looks, or where to start on finding a look that best suits you.

Outstanding Customer Service from this standalone Philosophy store.  Dropped in for their President's Day Sale (25% off) looking to purchase more of their Keep the Peace Color Corrector.   Turns out, they were out and won't have a shipment in for two weeks. Bummer!  Cheryl was kind enough to take my phone number and promised to call as soon as it gets in. And will honor the 25% off. She also hooked me up with a sample to get me through.   Delighted customer indeed. :)  Also, heard a rumor Philosophy intends to ax the Keep the Peace line?! PLEASE DON'T!   Corporate, I HOPE YOU'RE READING (even after contacting customer service):  As someone who struggles with Rosacea, the KTP CC is an absolute godsend. I know many others who agree.  Yes, I love Bare Minerals. However, I'm an athlete. That means LOTS of sweat! 98% of the time, really don't feel like loading my face with make-up and prefer a minimalist approach (SPF moisturizer, KTP CC, mascara, brow powder, lip balm).  Philosophy ... PLEASE DON'T NIX THIS LINE.   If you buy any Philosophy products (Hope in a Jar, Purity, The Present, Miracleworker, etc.) at ULTA or Sephora, check out this location. You won't be disappointed with your experience!

Disappointed to be writing this review.  When we first moved to this area over a year ago, we made this our neighborhood Frys.   Super fresh produce, great meat sales, exceptional customer service. We got to know the baggers and some of the cashiers, and they remembered us by name.  Fast forward a year later. Moldy produce, flies galore. And we usually do our shopping on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, two out of three of those days are restocking days. If that's the new, fresh product, then what kind of science experiment was growing there before?  The only time I'll come here now is if I need some kind of non-perishable ingredient or a spice, maybe some fresh flowers if company is coming over.   Started shopping at the Sprouts and other Fry's down the road and have yet to have any issues like the ones described.   I hope they turn things around - It's in a great convenient location.

Right across the street from Sprouts Farmer's Market, easy in and out no hassle parking lot.   Much cleaner and better organization in comparison to the Alma School and Warner Frys we used to shop at.   I will continue doing my non-SFM at this Frys!

Sprouts, where have you been all my life?  Started buying all of my produce here after a serious decline in quality at my neighborhood Frys.   Have yet to see any rotting produce. Everything is organized and easy to find, which is kind of hard to mess up in the first place seeing as it's a smaller grocery store.   You go into these types of stores expecting to pay an arm and a leg. Well, not at Sprouts. Organics for the same price as regular Frys produce? Done!  And as much as I love Whole Foods, Sprouts is by far more affordable for essentially the same items.   The vitamin and supplement selection is insane, and associates are knowledgeable, and more than happy to assist you in finding what you need. MSM, Niacinamide and Traumeel all the way for Rosacea management . . . Screw your antibiotics, dermatologists.   Love the abundance of bulk. Spices, snacks, you name it. So far, have only stopped in for quinoa and flaxseed.   Can we also talk about the ambiance in here? Haha, how often do you hear THAT word in a grocery store review?! Not a whole lot of Southeast Valley douchebaggery to be seen...yet. Everyone always seems to be in a pleasant mood. It's like a little slice of Northern Colorado in Chandler.   Also, thanks for not judging me for doing my shopping in sweaty spandex after hammer practices and workouts, Sprouts. Blend right in with all the cyclists, etc. I think we're going to get along just fine and dandy.   Recommended!

My primary care doctor sent me to Spooner Physical Therapy after what I/she thought was a training-related back / hip injury (I'm a post-collegiate, aspiring POORfessional track and field hammer thrower).   Turns out, it's a 13cm cyst chillin' out on my right kidney. Hooray for ANOTHER cancer scare . . .  Said no one ever . . .   Point aside, I really, really enjoyed working with Trevor Carr! Very attentive and patient guy who truly seemed invested in my care beyond getting his paycheck.   Before we found out this wasn't an injury, he was going to come out and watch me throw at a practice to better understand what was going on with my body.  If that isn't exceptional, then please tell me what is!   My coach had this to say, actually kind of funny: "It's too bad this dude isn't a magician, since your idiot M.D. obviously thought he was and could 'PT AWAY' a blob growing in your body!"   The support staff (technicians, administrative) have all been fantastic.  Any actual injuries that do occur in future (knock on wood this isn't the case), I would return to Spooner Physical Therapy and Trevor in a heartbeat.   Highly recommended!  UPDATE 3/2: No cyst at all. Turns out I've been living 25 years on one BEAST kidney! The "dead" one is just swollen . . . larger than my liver . . . pressing up against everything, hence the pain. It's gotta go.   Don't let me down for post-surgical rehab!

Wrote a previous review in February about my "back injury" misdiagnosis galore that turned out to be a 10 pound dead kidney, thanks to a UPJ obstruction that most likely happened while I was still developing in the womb. Didn't even know about it until this year. Hello, pain!   Sick of being at the mercy of when it would throw its next temper tantrum, sometimes coupled with vomiting, and not being able to throw hammer, my surgeon and I agreed it was time to have that useless sack o' fluid evicted in April.   Turns out even if you don't have an open nephrectomy, you can still lose a lot of abdominal strength. So, back to Spooner Physical Therapy!   Had the pleasure of working with Trevor again - Who else?   I can hear him now if he ever saw this review. "Oh no, Meg?! That lady was one high maintenance pain in my left butt cheek. Never again. Like, ever!"  I sincerely appreciated his willingness to get down to business, creating a solid plan to help rebuild strength so I could train and compete again. Even if he did enjoy "beating up" on my ugly surgical scars with a huge smile on his face.   Of course, if I didn't do my part, I wouldn't be back to throwing right now.   Getting someone functioning again is only half the battle.   Almost everyone I encountered here seemed invested in your recovery beyond your condition. Or they're just pros at faking interest in you as a person and not just another number . . . Which would suck.   When I first came here in January, I was extremely nervous that I'd have another awful PT experience like I did in Colorado. These PTs were some of the most miserable, jaded trolls ever.   None of my concerns were founded at Spooner, really. Was here around fourish months this year, and it was the best PT experience I've had. Not like anyone wants to be here though, yeah?   Still stand by everything said in my previous review.   This has been the hardest year of my life, having two surgeries within an eight month period and losing what would've been my first season back in the ring. Elated to finally slam the door and not look back.   Surely, you're in good hands with whoever you see at SPT.   But they should know that Trevor is a real asset to their team.  Still recommended! And I hope to never see any of these people again in a rehab capacity.

Do you enjoy grease saturated (not in a good way), subpar chain food, and being violently ill before you even have the chance to leave the restaurant?   Then by all means, hit up The Elephant Bar!   Haven't been since 2005 (dinner with my Dude's family) and 2011 (my friend had her Bachelorette Party Dinner here).   Sick within 30 minutes of eating a burger one of the first times you meet the people who are now essentially your in-laws? Not cool.   Perhaps this review is a little off seeing as it has been two years.  But yeah, never would come here of my own accord.   A star for fantastic service and another for great cocktails.   Otherwise: Avoid, avoid, avoid!

Fibber Magees kicks so much ass!   Very traditional in appearance; all wood.   Oh it's "too Irish", ya say?! I love how un-modern this place is for an Irish pub . . . and those giant wooden kegs you can sit at! Don't need that flash and flare. Just give me the beer!   Smithwicks on tap? Sold! Fabulous specials about every night of the week. Half off pints and appetizers Sunday, $5 burgers and $3 bottles of Guinness Black Lager on Monday nights.  There's plenty of other tap beers as well as a rotation of craft beers, some local.   Try the Dirty Apple. It's a fusion of Guinness and an Irish cider. LOVED it.   Whiskey on whiskey on whiskey. Forgot the bartender's name, but he was more than helpful this weekend when we asked for his favorite whiskey suggestions. Thanks, dude!   The Bleu Burger is already fresh and flavorful; it's even better when you add bacon. The Corned Beef and Cabbage is the best I've had.   Try the garlic fries at your own risk . . . They're addicting. Especially the garlic aioli sauce that comes with them. Don't say you weren't warned.   Look forward to coming back on a night with live music!

Amados is far better than all of the Valley "Something-Bertos" in every way.   Sure, the front of the store may look "sketchy" for Tempe *eyeroll*, but walk on in anyway and you'll find some delicious late night Mexi-grub.   We ordered the Carne Asada Burrito (hold the guacamole) to go, with plenty of the red and green salsas.   Fresh pico de gallo and well-seasoned Carne, big enough for two to share you're sure to satisfy your cravings.   The salsas had just the right amount of kick to them, but nothing painfully spicy.   Open 24 hours, drive-thru for when you're lazy, prices lower than your buddy -Berto (no $10 nachos here!) . . . Stop in next time you're plastered or simply wanting a burrito.

MMM ... Yeup, you best believe I can get rocked with the BBQ at Lucille's!    Oh, sure, there'll be a lot of reviews here pointing out it's chain-ness, the cheesy decor, etc. yet when you're at Tempe Marketplace, this is an excellent dining option.  I'm still sad they pulled the Carolina Style Pulled Pork from the menu.   As much as I hate to pay $5 for a freaking strawberry lemonade, I get it just about every.freaking.time. It is that good!   The biscuits with apple butter are heavenly.   My last trip in, Dude and I split the two meat combo: Pulled Pork and Tri Tip, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese for our two sides.    The pulled pork was just alright, kind of tough. The tri tip though? Phenomenal. Sauce it up for a good time.   Mac and cheese is sinfully delicious. Heck, I'd drop in for just a bowl of that stuff. The server claimed there is bacon in it; however, I wasn't able to detect any.   Friendly service, BBQ comfort food  . . . Just bring your stretchy pants, 'cause you're going to need them.

I've always loved hanging out at Four Peaks in Tempe, but man oh man SanTan gives it a run for its money! It's evolved into my favorite Downtown Chandler haunt.  SanTan is always loud and bumping with tons of people, but that's part of the fun. Love hanging out on the patio during the cooler months. Don't worry, there's heat lamps for you "60 degrees is cold!" wussfaces out there.   Their beer is excellent; try the Epicenter and Devil's Ale. Oh, and MR. PINEAPPLE when it's back in season. So good!   Haven't tried much of the food here (seeing as we're usually on a liquid bread diet upon entering, haha), but the Buffalo Chicken pizza was something different and you can share the personal sized one with one, maybe two others!  Happy to have SanTan in my neighborhood!

I love Japanese food and Teppanyaki cooking.  That being said, while Benihana isn't my favorite place to go for this, you'll still find good food and a fun experience.   Most recently, I was here with my family for my Dad's birthday.   We had the pleasure of having Sam as our cook, and he put on one heck of a show.   You start with a mushroom and onion soup, green salad with a tasty ginger dressing, and some shrimp with grilled veggies.  I ordered the Terriyaki Chicken, and it was decent.  The only reason I'm giving these guys the fourth star is because my mother found a staple or part of a pair of tongs in her salad, and the manager was kind enough to comp her meal and beverages.  Lastly, don't forget to sign up for the Benihana Chef's Table Club. $30 for your birthday; say what?!   Like I said, there's many other places that come to mind when I hear the word Teppanyaki, but Benihana can be a lot of fun for any special occasion.

If you're into Ahwatukee Housewives swapping and popping prescription smack on Saturday night, having your ass grabbed by a creepy divorcee old enough to be your father, weak sauce beverages and "Mexican food" that makes Taco Bell look appealing, then you will absolutely love Loco Patron.  I also haven't been back in four years, so maybe things have changed. Still, I wouldn't go out of my way to give it another shot.

One of the nicest YMCA locations in the Valley! This is the one I joined at. Lots of memories here of getting murdered 10 times over by my throwing coach as a young teen.   Clean facility, generally positive atmosphere. Staff is always friendly staff (Mary, Christine, Jill, Julyen, Peggy, know someone's missing), fantastic group fitness classes. Up to date equipment and plenty of it.   As with most "normal people" gyms, only one squat rack so if you actually bother to work out your legs / whole body, be ready to contend with some clown doing bicep curls on it. Major points for having kettlebells!   Great place to people watch too. Top heavy bros lifting and Ahwatukee housewives giving you the death glare for daring to lift more than five pounds over your head. Oh yeah! I said it. Pick up some weights, damnit. It's all fun. :)   I'm not a parent, but some of my friends are, and they say the Childcare facility and staff is as top-notch as it gets for what this place is. I do know growing up, my Mom was OK with leaving my youngest brother there and he always had fun.   They also run seasonal camps.   If you're thinking about joining, just do it!  It's in a great location, and if you're looking to go to the gym only without all the frills of haircuts, smoothies/coffee, massages, other unnecessary amenities, you really can't beat the monthly price.   I truly miss this place since I've moved, and always make it a point to come back and get a workout in if I'm in the neighborhood.

WOW! Yeah, not happening again, Home Depot.  At least not this particular location.   Went in seeking a Chrome Dance Trip Lever for the guest bathroom toilet (thing snapped when we had company over, haha).   Armed with the SKU number and everything, because I'm not a "do-nothing bitch" around the house who needs her husband to fix everything. *eyeroll*    Found the correct aisle and bay number, nothing. Huh, that's strange, HD's website said they were in stock.  Asked two frenzied associates for help.   Got nothing but yelled at about how "busy she was". Even repeatedly yelled at me to "Get out of the aisle!" while walking two other customers down it.   Finally was able to get help from the second associate, who informed me that when their website says it's available in store, that means I would have to order it online and pick up at the customer service desk.   Wait, what?! This makes no sense.   Immediately walked out and went down the street to Lowe's where I immediately found the part needed.   Go to any Home Depot but this one, folks.

I'm not a Vegetarian or a Vegan, but this place is delicious, fresh, and gets local produce for their products.   My favorite is the Voodoo Cooler. Apple, Grape, Cucumber, Celery, Carrot, Beet, Lime, and secret ingredient . . . Dragon Sauce! Sinus drain much?   Also, their Vegan cupcakes are pretty kickass! 24 Carrots sponsored Phoenix's Take Back The Night Rally and March this past March, and our volunteer crew was able to sample mini versions of them.   Give this place a go!

Dutch Bros is the BUSINESS! Always delicious coffee and quick service. Also, it's awesome that the Baristas actually know how to engage you in conversation (not forced or fake) and put a smile on your face!   Make sure you get a stamp card for Two-Punch Tuesdays.   Favorites:   - ER 911  - POTENT Iced Coffee - The Kicker   You gotta love how insanely efficient this location is. After I dropped my boss off at the airport this morning, I decided it was time to get caffeine fix #2 of the day.   There was quite the line, so someone came out and took orders from everyone in line. Pulled up to the window, paid for my drinks, and was on my merry way to the office.   Can you beat / do that, Starbucks? Didn't think so. ;)

I've been getting my hair cut here since I was 13. And that was long before they moved to this location.   Priscilla is the BEST stylist at Madison Avenue! My mom, my sisters and myself have trusted her with our hair for over 10 years. Perfect every time. Unless I move again . . . no one else is touching my hair!   I also get a gel manicure from Heidi once a month. Aside from doing phenomenal work, this lady has insane memory about what's going on with her clients. You'll be chatting during your manicure or pedicure, and your next appointment she'll ask, "Hey how did __________ go?"   Recommended.

Heidi left Madison Avenue in August :'(   But Debra, the manager in nails and resident New Yorker has been an AWESOME replacement. She's truly interested in her clients and is a lot of fun to chat with. Angela is awesome, too!   If you like Debra's work, and know you will get your nails done regularly, try and book out all of your appointments for the entire year. She's VERY popular and hard to get appointments with.   New (ish) program called MADISON AVENUE RETAIL REWARDS! You pay $40, and for the entire year, you get 20% off on retail items - hair products, skincare, etc. - jewelry or services not applicble.   It's a worthwhile investment if you buy liters of Redken, Pureology, Aveda, etc. Shampoo and Conditioner liters from stores like ULTA - SAVE YOURSELF SOME CASH and just get them here with the card!   While it doesn't apply to services, being a Retail Rewards member will put you on an EXCLUSIVE e-mail list where offers for discounted services, extra discounts on products will be sent to you.

Dude picked this up one night on the way home from work. They've been sticking menus in our door for over a year now, so it was time.   We got . . .   1) Mongolian Beef with Fried Rice 2) Quart of Hot and Sour Soup   All of this came out to around $14.    Seriously some of the best fried rice around. Not too greasy. Heavy handed with the stir fried vegetables in the beef, which was great. No sauce overdose like that one corporate Chinese place loves to do.   I wasn't expecting a whole lot from the Hot and Sour soup, but it was fresh and filling. Mix in some of that rice and Sriracha and you're golden.  Can't wait to try out some of the other offerings.

Waffle House is the Ultimate Hangover Helper.  So picture this: It's your annual company Christmas party.  You knock back three too many glasses of Pinot Noir and not enough jalapeno bacon wrapped shrimp and bruschetta to counter the effects.  Upon waking up, your partner (kind enough to DD / ensure you don't say anything dumb around the Company President or boss, thanks love!) informs you you survived the night with your dignity and class fully intact.  High-fiiiiiiiiiiive!  But, you still wake up exceptionally hungover.   What do you do? You hit up Waffle House for a hangover breakfast to feel better stat, that's what!   I can stumble to the counter wearing Yoga pants and hoodie with my hair a hot mess and no one will judge me (outloud).   At least I hope not. Come on, it's near ASU fah cryin' out loud! Oh, you're judging me? Pound sand, sweetheart.   The place was clean, and the employees were friendly enough.  I can get some coffee, scrambled eggs, semi greasy hash browns and a heaping stack of raisin toast for a great price and feel halfway better by 1PM.   Thanks Waffle House for always solving our hangover crises and drunk munchies needs! I know we'll meet again soon ...

Can't believe I've lived in Chandler for almost two years now and just making my way over to Sunset Library!   Oh yeah, call me a geek because I still use the library. Come at me. ;)   Don't expect anything like Phoenix's Burton Barr ... I like to think of this place as a community library.   The staff here was very friendly in showing me around and setting up my account!  Easy enough to get a card; just prove you're a Chandler resident (drivers license or car registration work just fine).   When you first get your card, you may check out five items. Bring them back on time, and you can check out up to 100 items (obviously there's a limit on DVDs and CDs).   Nice computer area, and I believe you can print for 20 cents a page.  Lots of study rooms you can reserve for students and anyone else looking to get their study / productive-ness on.   Oh, and the bathrooms were clean in comparison to other places, always a plus!   Glad to have you in the neighborhood, Sunset Library!

Went to Frys in the same area recently . . . R.I.P., Dark Horse. This place is now Fullers :(   Dark Horse was one of the best Dive Bars in Chandler! Used to be a regular hangout for my friends and I on Friday nights. Karaoke, anyone? Always had a great time.   My friend is a musician, and she'd come here to sing / play in 2009 when Dark Horse had open mic on Thursday nights. Nice to get local musicians some exposure.   Fantastic drink specials; delicious Long Island Iced Teas and a beer on tap for everyone.   Will definitely miss this place!

The friendliest ULTA experience I've had to date.   The other locations I visit, you rarely get a greeting let alone assistance finding a product.   Immediately when I walked in, a nice gentleman (wish I remembered his name, had a septum nose ring) welcomed me and asked if I needed help.   Why yes, I do - All turned around as this isn't my usual store.   Took me right to the Mario Badescu products, got my eye cream, paid and was on my merry way.   Hope future visits to this ULTA are similar. I will never hesitate to drop in if I'm at Tempe Marketplace and need to replenish something in my beauty stash. :)

I agree with a previous reviewer: You either know what Fossil is selling or you don't.  OK, fine: High quality watches, jewelry, accessories, handbags. Yeah, you get the picture.  Dude has bought me several watches from this location as gifts, and anytime I've had to go in for an adjustment, cleaning, etc. I've always been met with superior customer service.  If you're looking for Rosegold ANYTHING, look no further than Fossil.   Been eyeing their new collection, so maybe I'll be in for a new timepiece or some earrings soon!

Loyal Gap / Banana Republic / Old Navy Customer here! Love that they have short length pants for us "short and curvy" gals. Saves me a trip to alterations.  What to say about this location?   Fantastic selection, awesome outlet steals on women's clothing. Love the Friends and Family 40% off weekend sales.   So why one star then? Customer Service leaves much to be desired. Rude associates; God forbid you ask them to do their jobs should you need a different size, etc. Expect sheer annoyance.   Of course I'm not surprised being this Arizona Mills and all.   Why do I still come back to witness some "Social Darwinism in action" then?   Outlet. That's about it.

Oh my Gaaawwwd. Kicking myself for not trying the Cornish Pasty Company sooner! This is a Mesa (or Tempe) "Must-Try"!   My Dude and I have been here twice now. Reasonably priced delicious food, a wide variety of brews and attentive service all make it a great experience here.   There's a hipster vibe going on, but that's not a bad thing. We like to joke that this place could pass for one of the pubs out of Harry Potter.  It's dark inside, with empty liquor and wine bottles being used as candles. Another great touch to the great ambiance.   The first time we went, we got a table up front.   Picky Eater Advisory: It should be noted that the Pasties are cooked to order, but you can't add or subtract ingredients.   Also, be prepared to wait a while. Good food takes time! Just grab a beer and enjoy your company.   Tried the Lamb Vindaloo and the traditional Oggie pasties. Both were absolutely delicious! Tender lamb, and the spices used weren't too overbearing, but I was sweating buckets. Which my Mexican thought was hilarious. Damn you, Dude.   Love that they can wrap the other half of your pasty in foil to take home instead of boxes.   We also tried the oven chips with jalapeño and garlic. Cooked to perfection, but not overcooked. Don't feel like the jalapeños contributed much and probably wouldn't add them again.  The last time we were here, it was crazy busy, so we sat at the Pasty Bar (not to be mistaken for the actual bar)! Change it up sometime, it was cool to watch the pasties being made.   We got the Bangers and Mash and the Cheeseburger Royale pasties this time. Again, both great.   Our waitress forgot to put in our order for oven chips, and was awesome enough to comp it from the check.   Downside to the Bar? You can come across groups of people telling you to "move over" so they can fit their group together. Rude and annoying if you just got your Pasties, but this time not a huge deal as we were about to get our check and leave.  There's so many Pasties to choose from, which makes things overwhelming when it comes time to order.   Look forward to working my way through their Pasty offerings and bringing my family and friends here for brews, good food and good times!

Hello, my name is Meg . . . and I'm a Victoria's Secret addict.  Seriously, there needs to be some kind of 12-step program for this!   Yes, it's a corporate chain. Yes, it's part of Limited Brands. But not once have I ever experienced poor customer service at this location. Everyone is always pleasant and helpful, bordering on Stepford Wives nice, haha!   The worst thing that's happened? A pushy Sales Associate aggressively trying to push a Bombshell, "ADD TWO CUP SIZES!" bra on me and a couple other busty-looking customers. Umm . . . one, false advertising, two, NO THANK YOU!   Also, I wish they sold their swimwear line here. Always fun playing "size roulette" when ordering online.   Things I love:  1) Complimentary fittings 2) AWESOME Semi-Annual Sale in January and July 3) 5/$26 Cotton Lingerie . . . Sometimes 7/$26 . . . PANTY RAID! 4) 3/$33 most other styles (Angels, Incredible, Very Sexy, The Lacie, etc.)  5) Merchandise stands the test of time. Hasn't fallen apart in the wash . . . yet.   My last trip here, they were out of my size in a basic color of an Angels Bra. The Sales Associate whips out an iPad, and has it shipped to my house . . . paid nothing for shipping!   I will continue shopping at this location - Can't wait to see the remodeled store!

Mmm, the Vine!   I'm a huge fan of the Rural and Apache location by ASU, but this one is closer to my neighborhood. Great place; chill ambiance, perfect for catching up with your friends over a beer, or even watching just about any game. Friendly service.    Speaking of which, funny that people are griping about ASU students frequenting this location and being out of control . . . Found it to be the complete opposite here. Sounds like y'all are describing the other location! Maybe this is just my experience.   Delicious wings, never slimey and always have come out crispy. Best flavors are the Superhot and Spicy Garlic.   Thirty two ounce beers for $5 and under and Happy Hour is seven days a week.   Thanks for having Leinenkugel Summer Shandy on tap, guys! :)

Get the Ahwapuhi Wild Ginger Deep Conditioning Treatment. Your hair will love you for it!   Also, remember: These are STUDENTS. If you're used to in and out salon trips with Master Stylists and Artistic Directors . . . well,  you won't find that here. Make sure you block out a couple of hours in your schedule.  Helpful Tip: You can't add gratuity on your card when you pay, so make sure you have cash handy to tip your stylist!

Came back here in May for an Ahwapuhi Wild Ginger Deep Conditioning Treatment with Missy F. and Sarah R.   As always, absolutely luxurious! That soft feeling that lasts for weeks . . . Oh yeah! My longtime stylist at Madison Avenue was asking what I had been doing to my hair. :)   I'm finding that the night staff here has a little more experience than the day staff, both in terms of what they do with your hair and their people skills, too.   Worth repeating to anyone whose time is at a premium: These are STUDENTS. You are a guest (albeit, a paying one, but still) at their SCHOOL. Please do NOT be a jackass and tell the student who's working on your hair to speed things up, just finish or anything else of that nature. R-U-D-E!   Seriously, witnessed several people around me getting services say this to students during my last visit and had to resist the urge to slap them to Kingdom Come.   If you're in such a hurry or want something highly specific done to your hair, be willing to shell out some dough to see an Artistic Director or Master Stylist in a salon that's not a teaching facility. Or just go to Supercuts.    Paige Kimes did a fantastic job with the treatment, chatting me up, and one of the better blowouts I've had done in a while.   The front desk staff has always been friendly.   In May, PM runs their 2 for $22 sale on Shampoo, Conditioner . . . so the Dude had me pick up some of Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Mint Shampoo they use at Sports Clips. What a Diva!   I will definitely continue seeing Paige. Five months overdue for some Ahwapuhi Love, so hopefully soon!

Ahh, yes!   Ahwatukee Douchebaggery meets what's supposed to be unpretentious late night Mexican fare.   Won't hide it, I dig Filiberto's from time to time.  The bean and cheese burrito is delicious, quesadillas aren't too bad, and the carne asada fries (hold the liquefied guacamole) act as the perfect booze absorption method. The red salsa is good, too!   Most of the time I come in after a night of binge drinking; sometimes sober.   This occasion was one of the sober ones. Dude and I were dog/house sitting down here for a few weeks and thought a Fili B's run was a great idea to go with our beer growler.   $10 Carne Asada Nachos? Ok, ridiculous, but whatever.    Are you going to get a solid customer service experience at a Fili B's?  Absolutely not, and I don't expect one.  But being insanely rude to customers at the drive up window, practically throwing our debit card back, and intentionally sticking green salsa in our bag with a side of heavy eye rolling after we requested the red (in response to you asking which type, twice)?    Unacceptable.  Next time, I'm just going to Toxic Smell.

I instantly give four stars to a place with my college nickname.  Jokes aside, Bergie's Coffee Roast House is ADORABLE.  The garden patio seating is plentiful, and the inside has a relaxed, homie vibe.   I dropped in for an Americano after brunch at Liberty Market.   The Baristas were the owners kids (found this out after asking them where the shop name came from). Seemed a little shy when interacting with customers.   The Americano was strong, not bitter, and packed with caffeine - Wouldn't recommend this beverage if you're sensitive to caffeine in any way.   Can't wait to come back for more coffee, and perhaps sneak off to get a little work done in the quiet environment.   Well done, Bergie's . . . You've got yourself a new customer.

It's definitely not our favorite, but Clockwork sure beats those nasty chains (think Dominos, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars) when we're thinking, "Yeah, it's pizza and wine night!" And for about the same price!   Discovered this place when we moved to Chandler last year. Someone stuffed coupons in our door.  Haven't tried delivery, but it's close enough to our house to drive down the street and pick up.   Everyone we've encountered in the store has been incredibly friendly.   Love the Greek Gyro Pizza. Plenty of Gyro meat and fresh vegetables for toppings.   It even comes with a side of tzatziki sauce!   The Godfather Clock Pizza is also good; just your classic combination pizza.   Glad to have Clockwork nearby!

This has absolutely nothing to do with bad service, or even expectations about the food. It's a Denny's.   Had a work breakfast meeting here last month.   Case of the Mondays, meet MSG induced food poisoning. Can you guess where this review is going?  My boss got pretty sick. So did my coworker. Who knows how many others did. I know I did. Blowing out both ends . . . Ain't nobody got time for that!   Never again!

Three years ago, my work was located in one of the many business parks near Lunch Break.   More like, you could throw a rock and hit this place... Kind of!   So if you work in this area, you know there's not too many options for lunch.   Lunch Break had some of the best breakfast paninis ever.    Fluffy eggs, buttery toasty, thick slices of bacon and cheddar.   Definitely not good for you, but oh so good!   The veggie wrap and buffalo chicken panini with celery and bleu cheese also made for a great lunch.   Highly recommend giving this place a try if you work in the area and need to escape the daily grind for a minute!

**Disclaimer: Haven't been in this store, just had a cupcake.**  Last summer when Missy F. was staying with my Dude and I for a while, she popped into Mind Over Batter and brought us both a cupcake as her way of saying, "THANKS, Y'ALL!"  What a delicious cupcake! Extra moist (lawl, moist) cake and just the right amount of coconut.  I would totally stop in and pay $3 to have one of these babies again!

When I'm in Ahwatukee and want to grab a quick bite before a movie next door at AMC, Vincent's is my go-to.   This is a no frills pizza place, but damn do they deliver on taste!   Love the huge White Slices (Spinach, healthy garnishment of Ricotta) with a pint of Blue Moon.    You can't go wrong with the price, either, and you won't leave hungry!  The Garlic Knots were also great.   Great customer service, too. Years ago, I met my friend here for Pizza and beers.   When the server dropped our pizza on the floor, he comped it because of the wait time.   Outstanding customer service!   I heard a rumor that they closed recently. Sure hope this isn't true. Ahwatukee is the land of strip malls and  crappy chain eateries -Vincent's was a refreshing change.

iMadre de Dios! Tacos N More is fantastic!  I've been training at nearby CrossFit 347 for almost nine months now.   The athletes and coaches have RAVED about the breakfast burritos, the menudo, and the tacos - oh, por supuesto -  it's in their NAME after all.   Nothing like having to smell the heavenly aroma of the breakfast burrito your Coach is chowing down on . . . Whilst shouting, "GET VERTICAL ON YOUR DAMN PULL!" . . . All while you're on your fifth set of heavy hang snatches at 85% of your max.   What. A. Jerk.  Anyway, starving after a Thursday night workout, I finally stopped in and ordered some tacos to-go.   I ordered the 3-Taco Plate. Three tacos with the tortilla of your choice, the meat of your choice, and the option to include lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and sour cream. Obligatory Rice and Beans.   My choices?   1) Carne Asada Taco in a Crunchy Corn Shell 2) Pollo Asada in a Flour Tortilla 3) Carnitas in a Corn Tortilla.   All for a little more than $8.   While I waited for my food, I went HAM on their salsa bar. Filled some cups with both red salsas, pico de gallo and a salsa verde.   Drove 30 minutes back into town, walked in the door, famished at this point ready to inhale the tacos.  I have to say my favorite was the Carne Asada. It wasn't the best ever, but it was nicely seasoned and not overly cooked. The hard shell was a nice fit.   Wasn't too impressed with the Pollo Asada that night, and the Carnitas were passable but not as good as that famous street taco place in Ahwatukee.  Watch out for the liquid-ier red salsa; that stuff was pure fire. The chunky red wasn't as hot.   Wish they has a middle of the road option for red salsa.  Beans and rice were meh.   Is Tacos N More gourmet, authentic Mexican?   Absolutely not.   But they offer up tasty food at an affordable price, with friendly service.   And this is just what Maricopa needed, seeing as this city is saturated with fast food chains.  It's worth the 20-30 minute wait for your food to come out.  I'll be back after a day of heavy Saturday training.

Oh my goodness. I had so much fun here . . . All while being sober as a bird!   Met up with a group of Yelp friends for Preston S.'s Back to Drinking UYE! What an awesome idea, except I wasn't able to drink. Next one. Promise, y'all.   So this was my first time at Hula's and I loved it! The Tiki Hut theme and décor were done nicely. Not tacky at all like I was expecting for a themed place like this. And bet that patio is amazing during the cooler months with the fire pit.   Our group sat in the bar. Forgot our server's name, but he was quick with the waters and making sure everyone was OK. He was also awesome enough to suggest a virgin "Hula Juice" for me, HAH!   And of course, he put up with our rowdy crowd with a smile!   The Dude and I tried the Crispy Coconut Shrimp Rolls and the Blackened Shrimp Tacos. The rolls were perfect; not overly fried. They came with a pineapple and shredded coconut sauce.   Wasn't too impressed with the tacos; however, I will give Hula's props for actually having a legit "salsa roja". Finally, someone didn't false advertise. And this wasn't even a Mexican place . . .   A little bird also told me there's another Hula's in Santa Cruz, CA? I hope that's true! Family has a beach house out there.    Overall, I had a great time with our group and can't wait to come back here and actually enjoy a few rum-loaded beverages!   Looking forward to the next Back to Drinking UYE!

Hmm, how to describe this place? An adult candy store . . . Wine enthusiast paradise  . . . yeup, that sounds about right!  Expect to be ID'ed at the door. If you're female, under 5'5" and look younger than your age, expect to be ID'ed a couple of times throughout the store. But that's really no big deal.   If you have time to kill, it's fun to chat with some of the serious winos that frequent Total Wine & More. One of them helped me find an AWESOME Malbec (Maipe, Reserve).   One of their employees introduced me to Kitchen Sink (Red and White Blends)  and Radius Wines (Washington State - good stuff). My favorite from Radius? The Cabernet Sauvignon. Delicious, and works perfectly with my Red Wine Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting recipe. You read that right! :)   The beer selection is phenomenal; I've found a lot of my favorites from Colorado Breweries. Creating your own six pack is the best part!  Will cost you less than the grocery store in the long run, so Total Wine is worth the trip for sure!

There's not a lot I can say about Eco Laundry that hasn't been said, but Lisa E. was spot on about it being the "Cadillac of Laundromats".  This place was NOTHING like the sketchy, muggy  laundromats I frequented during my college years.   With a variety of machines that can handle washes ranging from one load all the way up to six, you're good to go!   Friendly attendants.   I'll pop in here from time to time to wash and dry our comforter to save us a little time at home.   They even offer a laundry service at .99 cents per pound. Noticed a lot of families taking advantage of this service; heck, I would too if I weren't so damn particular about my threads!   Superb people watching. Wi-Fi for when you need to get a little work done. Clean restrooms, consistent air conditioning and easy access to several eateries and a grocery store for that coffee fix - I'll be back again and again!

When I first moved back down here from Colorado, I found myself partaking in some "Wasted Karaoke" at a now closed Chandler dive.   My friend and I were approached by a rep from Sleepy Dog Brewing to try some samples. Obviously, couldn't remember what they were because we were schnockered into next week, but they were tasty and we vowed to check them out.  Five years later, it finally happened.   Dude and I had some time to kill because my friend and her boyfriend were "running late". Going to let you decipher that one. ;)   What a chill atmosphere! It's simply a brewery and a bar, nothing more.   Lots of tables and even a couch you can chill on; kind of reminds me of many a living room I partied in back in college.   Plus the slideshow of pictures of customer's dogs is adorable. Hello Dog Mom?   Also, while Sleepy Dog doesn't have a food menu, you can bring in take-out or whatever you want. There's also a Popcorn machine with a variety of seasonings, so help yourself!   Althooouuughhhh this bird on Twitter told me they're going to begin serving food soon. Woohoo!   Ordered a flight of all their beers at some obscenely low awesome price, like $6.50 for more than generous pours.   I enjoyed all of them sans the Tail Chaser IPA. The Wet Snout Milk Stout is easily a favorite . . . Nice, chocolatey and smooth, everything you want in a beer - And everything you want to whip up a batch of cupcakes with.   Dude enjoyed this place so much that he hosted his first Brews Cruise UYE here with about roughly 15 of our friends, neighbors and coworkers. Service was pretty solid even with a big group.   We enjoy coming back in with some grub for a low maintenance date.   Definitely get into Sleepy Dog to try their beers!

Another great YMCA location.   A little more spacious fitness center than Tempe and Ahwatukee YMCA, plenty of cardio equipment.   As is standard in these gyms, only one squat rack. You'll find the battling ropes, ViPR and the TRX stuff for those fitness gadget junkies out there.   My favorite thing about this place? The group fitness classes! Best out of all the locations I've been to.   First of all, can we talk about their dance studio? It's HUGE!  If you think Ahwatukee's is nice, please let Chandler-Gilbert change your mind. It would be perfect for a Zumbathon.  Speaking of which, Erika Ojeda's 5:45 Friday night ZUMBA class is what kept me coming back. Erika is my all-time favorite Zumba instructor, and I'm SAD she's no longer teaching this class (she's expecting a little one, AWW)!   However, I've done several classes with Kim and she's one badass instructor. Keeps everything high energy, so WELCOME, Miss Kim! Look forward to your class. :)   If glorified dance parties aren't your thing, maybe Cycle will be. Cecelia teaches a high intensity class! Haven't been in a while, but always had a lot of fun with this one.   Really wish this location would bring back Cecelia's Express Cycle class. 30 minutes instead of an hour, PERFECT for your lunch break. Only twice a week, gets you out of the office and off your lazy bum.   Keep up the awesome work, Chandler Gilbert team!

Lovely experience at this Bare Escentuals boutique from start to finish!   I dropped in here last night after a guy (at another beauty retailer) tried to match me at Jersey-Shore-Gal-Orange in my foundation and BB Tinted Primer.   Listen, ladies. I know you can buy BE products at ULTA and Sephora, but the staff there doesn't get the same extensive training on the product as these folks do.   Save yourself the trouble, embarrassment and money and stop here first. If only for a color match.  That way, even if you don't actually pick up your product(s) here, you'll at least know exactly what to buy somewhere else.   Sam was a doll and took her time to properly match me in the Matte Powder Foundation, the new BB Tinted Primer and the new Bareskin Liquid product.   By the way, if you hate liquid make-up (like me!), give Bareskin a go. It doesn't feel cakey at all.   As close of a match as possible without being barefaced!   My favorites:   1) PrimeTime Original 2) PrimeTime BB Tinted Primer  3) MATTE Powder Foundation 4) READY Blush  5) Well-Rested  6) Hydrating Mineral Veil   Cannot recommend this place enough!

Tempe, your secret is out. Lobby's Burgers is de-lic-ious!   Dropped in here with my Dude two months back for a quick, definitely not good for you dinner.   Tip: It's behind Gold Bar Espresso. Just drive around the building, and BOOM! Lobby's appears.  Immaculately clean inside. In fact, it seemed that someone was constantly cleaning the place while we were there. Just one gal working the counter, another cooking, and she was very patient with us as we ordered.   I had a Bacon Cheeseburger, lettuce wrapped, and Dude had the Chili Burger. We also tried some of the fries. Pst, split them with a friend, the serving is more than enough!  Lobby uses grass-fed beef, and you can certainly taste the difference. The burger had thick slices of pickles, tomatoes, onions, and fresh lettuce with sliced cheddar, bacon, and Lobby's secret sauce.  By the way, that sauce makes an awesome dip for the fries. Mmm mmm mmm!   This was the best "fast food" burger I've had in ages, and for a great price. Dude wasn't a fan of the chili, but I'm a nice lady friend and shared.   I don't know how you could think the mouthful of grease that's In-N-Out is still the "God of the Burger Industry" after eating at Lobby's Burgers.   Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!

**Update 9/13: Learned that all their yogurt is made in house, awesome! Pineapple flavored? Made WITH real pineapples! Twix flavored? Made WITH actual Twix bars! Refreshing change indeed!**  Kind of sad I overlooked this place so many times coming home from Arizona Mills or MBFGR. Dude was hesitant at first, but bet he's glad I dragged his butt out here after blah experiences at two lamesauce chains.   Very small place, but big on flavor. Seating is plentiful outside on two patios, which was nice on a cooler Phoenix night. The gal that was on duty was very friendly.   Loved the chalkboards that labeled each flavor above the dispensers; a cute touch instead of the printed cards you see so often. The Jumbo Mr. Potato Heads out on the coffee tables inside were hilarious!  Bet parents appreciate those while they're trying to make a yogurt bowl for their toddlers.  Sample cups aren't up for grabs, but Aloha's staff isn't stingy on them either.   Lots of interesting flavors named after candies, such as Watermelon Jolly Rancher and Twix Bar! Which by the way, blended with Peanut Butter . . . Twix Bar was AMAZING.   And I must say, the yogurt here was very rich and creamy, unlike the watered down dairy you'll sometimes find at those pesky chain places.   Fantastic deals too. Thursday night is BOGO . . . But if you check-in on Yelp any time, that offer is BOGO! First place I've seen around here with late night hours.  A little bird told me they put out Pumpkin Spice flavor in the fall. Can't get enough pumpkin in the fall, whether I'm cooking pumpkin and black bean chili, baking, or things like lattes, beer, etc...Let's just add Froyo to that list why don't we?!   Great customer service doesn't cost a business anything extra, and Aloha clearly recognizes that. We'll be back!

In spite of healthy skin care practices, my teenage acne RETURNED upon moving back to Arizona from Colorado. Damn. This. Heat.  Disclaimer: I'm not one of those women who flip out when a "major breakout" of three small zits appear. I'm talking a flood of oil, cystic acne and mega redness. NOT A GOOD LOOK AT 24.  My teenage brother recommended Dr. Kwon to me. My Dad also had MOHS surgery here when his doctor thought there was skin cancer on his nose. They both spoke of his humor (THIS DUDE IS PURE COMEDY!) and his committment to finding solutions for patients.   It's took almost a year of co-pays, reactions to the wrong topicals, not wearing make-up on my face for months at a time, trying anything and everything . . . but my face has finally returned to a clear state. It was worth it.   I'm in "maintenance" mode now, so hoping this keeps up through our Summer of Hell until I go back in November! :)

Two days ago at my annual "lady doctor" visit,  a cyst was found on my thyroid. Had some bloodwork done, then was sent next door to AZ Tech Radiology to have a Thyroid Ultrasound.  Let's see . . . It was easy to schedule an appointment, and the front desk staff was very personable, unlike most places I've been to. Tammy the tech was friendly enough.   I'm not sure about any of the other locations, but I had a good experience here.

It's sad when people at the radiology place know you by first name after a year of surgical hell.   Came back here in February for MRI and CT scans in the pursuit of figuring out what was happening with my back. Erm, kidney. Hah.   As always, appointments were easy to schedule, and everyone was polite and helpful. Got results back super fast.   Will was my MRI tech. Funny dude, too bad I was mega cracked out on sedatives and couldn't interact with him a little more.   James did my CT with IV contrast. In and out a lot quicker than the MRI.  Again, good experience overall . . . but honestly, what person in their right mind likes being trapped in a tube for hours or feel like you're pissing yourself while being pumped full of dye?!   No issues with billing and insurance, either.  Recommended. And hope to have no reason to come back here for a long, LONG time!

Sumits Yoga Chandler is a fantastic place to get your Yoga on.  I had my Sumits V-Card validated at a Yelp Elite Event in their North Phoenix Studio, and was instantly hooked.  SHOCKER.   Thankfully, there was a new student deal: 2 weeks of unlimited classes for $20.   This studio is just as beautiful as the North Phoenix one, spacious, welcome lobby with seating, yoga apparel available for purchase.   And no bleach/sweat assault on your olfactory senses, thank goodness.   My first class was with my good friend Amy B.; we went to Evan's Thursday night class.   He did a great job adjusting our posture, and overall encouraging and positive.   I also had the pleasure of taking several of Heidi's classes.  Those two were my favorite instructors.   Sumits plays fantastic music - Think Florence and the Machine, Iron and Wine, Bastille, City and Colour remixes.   I wish I could attend more often as the heat is AMAZING for my arthritic knees + flexibility required for hammer throwing (Track and Field) . . . But this place is E-X-P-E-N-S-I-V-E and why I'm deducting a star.  That doesn't stop me from dropping in every couple of weeks ($16).   Come to Sumits to practice mindfulness, and get a solid workout in in the process.

Dollar Tree Ahwatukee!  Conveniently located right next to the Safeway in this shopping plaza.  Great customer service for what it is, and friendly cashiers. So it always makes me sad to see some Ahwatukee Stepford Wife unloading on one of these poor people for things beyond their control. *eyeroll* Because God forbid you have to drive just a little more than a mile down the road to the Chandler and Kyrene store for your little prince or princess' party favors.  Best place for gift wrap, bags, ribbons, foil balloons, you name it and they probably have it. Unless you're looking for something uber specific, why pay more at Target?  Where else could you find $1 cookie tins, BAGS of Reeses, York, Snickers, M&Ms etc. for a last minute White Elephant gift at the office?  Check it out if you're in the area and need something basic. Promise it will be the most "bang for your buck"!

Local, Fresh, Organic, Vegan, Raw. Healthy indulgence at its finest.   Finally . . . A little slice of Unprocessed Heaven in Ahwatukee!   My favorite? The Sizzlin' Sesame Salad! Mixed greens, vibrant purple cabbage, tofu, brown rice, broccoli and carrot, topped off with chili almonds and orange miso dressing. Very unique.   Southwestern Mac and Cheese and the Bountiful Bowls were great too, just a little heavy for a work day.   Raw Almond Joy bars are delicious; even better than the original. OMG!!!!! So good.     Adorable décor! Nice remodel and expansion.     Staff is always super friendly, and the owner(s) will come around and chat with you personally which is always nice to see.   Just don't be a jackass and bring in food from Los Dos Molinos (or anywhere else)!   Don't let the vegan / vegetarian labels scare you - there's something for everyone at Pomegranate!

Last year, when faced with a week of no solid foods before AND after renal surgery, Dude asked me what/where I wanted to eat the Saturday before.    One place came to mind. Zinburger!   When you've got a week of chicken broth, water, Jell-O and Morphine to look forward to: Who in their right mind would turn up their nose to gourmet burgers, decadent and creative milkshakes and craveable sides?!  Over the last year and a half, we've gone 4-5 times. Friendly customer service every visit, and worth the wait time.  We've tried the Double Truffle Fries with Garlic Aioli, Onion Rings, Sweet Potato and Zucchini fries ... All delicious; however, the Double Truffle Fries are the winner here.  You can replace any patty with Kobe Beef or Turkey; they will also lettuce wrap them for all you Paleonerds and Low Carb Kids.   My favorites have been:   1) Turkey Burger: These guys do it right. Not your typical Jenni-O boring patties.  2) The Samburger: Cheese, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Thousand Island with the obligatory lettuce, tomato and onion.   I'd drive 30 minutes out here JUST for that Creme Brulee Shake.   Wish the Butterfinger one was a permanent menu option, not just another "Shake of the Month"!   Highly recommend sharing them. They are huge.   Hit up Zinburger to indulge any burger / "sin food" craving. And wear your fat pants. I know I'll be back ... Again and again!

This was the first Zoyo in the area that kicked off the other locations across town; also the first one I ever went to.   As per usual, nothing too different happening here.   It's what you'd expect for a frozen yogurt place. A variety of flavors, toppings bar, 42 cents an ounce. Looks like most of the other locations too with the roll up, glass garage doors with both indoor and patio seating. No cramped feeling at all.    They usually have Red Velvet here (first flavor I tried), but not on my most recent trip.  Unlike the McClintock and Guadalupe location in Tempe these guys are NOT sample cup hoarders. Extra star just for that!   They also have trash cans on the patio. Priorities, people!   Also, what makes this location my favorite is the customer service.   The District Manager that used to be here a lot, Mike, is hilarious and would always come out on the patio to chat my friends and I up.   He also was so kind and decided NOT to slaughter me for coming in decked out in a Colorado State University top on my first visit (was in town for a track meet). Therefore, I forgive him for being a University of Colorado Alum / BUFF fan.   See?! Frozen yogurt smoothing out a bitter, longtime Colorado college football (and everything else) rivalry. Kind of. ;)   Nice place to hit up in Ahwatukee if you need that froyo fix!

Oh hello, delicious!    Craving a big ol' bowl of yummy ramen? Look no further than Republic Ramen + Noodles.   Dude and I really enjoyed this place. Judging by the outside, you wouldn't expect to find this Tempe gem.   You walk in, and order at the counter and someone brings your ramen out to you. Both fountain and alcoholic beverages available, and know there's a Boba shop in here as well.   Clean, comfortable, open atmosphere with minimalist design with wooden benches and tables.   I had the Chili Ramen with Beef, Traditional Toppings, 8/10 spiciness, and Dude had the Republic Ramen with Beef, also with Traditional Toppings.   These bowls are HUGE and we could have easily shared one, but hey, lunch leftovers for work the next day.   Plenty of kick from that spice, and the beef was not fatty at all. Thinly sliced and tender. The noodles were just right, not overcooked.   I'm no ramen expert, but damn, this was yummy.   So mad we overlooked this joint for so long. Will definitely be back, and dragging my ASU brother along for a nice free meal on the big sis!

RigaTony's . . . What a let down! I love me some local business, so I'm sad and a little disappointed to be writing this review.   The Dude and I came in here last Fall with high hopes after our neighbors and other locals in Chandler and Tempe were constantly talking this place up. And let's not forget our trusty Yelp pals.   We were seated pretty promptly. Our waitress? Oh dear, she acted like we were one giant inconvenience. I'm always wary of anyone who can't make eye contact with the person they're talking to.   Her attitude was as lame as the food . . .   The salad was very unappealing. Lettuce became more of a vehicle for greasy salami and heavy cheese and dressing. Just plain nasty. Some of us actually do enjoy our greens.   We shared the Seafood Fettucine. "Shrimp, scallops, and fresh fish simmered in a delicate pesto-cream sauce simmered with garlic, lemon and white wine."  *trying to hold in laughter* Delicate?! More like heavy handed. This had the potential to be delicious. The fish wasn't overcooked. but man there was way too much sauce.   The focaccia bread was the most delicious thing we ate that night. Light, fluffy, brushed with just a little oil. Who goes to a restaurant for the bread, though?  These people have some enormous balls to be calling this Authentic Italian food because it doesn't come even close.   As my Nana Marilyn (an actual Italian, not, "OH EM GEE I'm x, y, z generation!") says, and I'll say again: Good tasting food does NOT need to be swimming in sauce.  Maybe we just tried the wrong thing. If we come back (I'm all for second chances), we'll have to try some of the more popular dishes and perhaps update this review.

My favorite Fascinations location in the Valley, and it's a good half hour haul up the 101 from my house.   Why?   1) Less traffic - Customer and Employee wise.   While the associates are still incredibly helpful, they're less "in your face" aggressive about sex toy demos or anything else you may need. No one has followed me like a lost puppy dog.   2) Superior lingerie selection when compared to the Kyrene and Elliott Road location (two miles from me!), and actual fitting rooms to try things on instead of those weird broom closets.   3) Used to carry actual PACKS of Kimono Microthin instead of the 3 trial packs. Saves you an Amazon order, shipping, etc. Not sure if this is the case anymore. If you haven't figured out what those are by this point in your life, make moves, dudes of Yelp ... You'll thank me later.  Like I said in my other review, if you're freaked out or embarrassed to be in a Fascinations store for any reason . . . It MUST be you.   Don't be embarrassed. This is a safe place! ;)

We had our seventh Breakfast Club UYE "Meeting" here in July . . . And even with an 8AM start time, it was our biggest turnout yet!   Lots of people were talking this place up at "past meetings", so my expectations were high.   You can't go wrong with $9.99 + tip on a Saturday morning!   Pretty much anything you want you can find here. Omelets cooked to order, all your typical breakfast meats, Asian foods, pancakes, biscuits and gravy, fruit, probably missing something here . . . Oh, and gelato. Yes, GELATO. Try the Blood Orange and Salted Caramel flavors.   The omelet was perfect, and I really enjoyed the Samosas from the Asian section.   Didn't really go crazy, but that's probably a good thing given the workout I had to skip off to immediately after.   I'm not a huge buffet person; however, I could see myself coming back.  Give Wandering Horse a try!

Clean Yogurtland store and convenient location near the Chandler mall!  I prefer a locally owned and operated froyo shop in Tempe, but sometimes it's hard to resist indulging in a little froyo after a day of shopping. Especially when stopping by is as simple as a short walk over from the Nordstrom parking lot; no big deal. ;)  Many different flavors to try available in dairy, non-dairy, sugar free and gluten free, but my favorites are the Plain Tart and Taro. Solid flavors!   Toppings bar has all the typical fruits, candies and sauces with a few surprises thrown into the mix.   Don't forget to start a punch card!

My Dearest China Magic Noodle House,   I have lived barely a mile away from you the past three years and have never given you the time of day.  How wrong was I to neglect your heavenly cuisine and ambiance (suspect olfactory assault included) that brings me right back to the Bay!   Dude and I dropped by on a lazy Saturday afternoon.   Based on many of our friends' Yelp reviews, we knew going in that we were going try the XO Spicy Beef Noodles ($8.25) and the Pan Fried Dumplings ($4.95).   Oh, those dumplings. Not your typical Chinese restaurant freezer dumplings; these babies are on 'roids! There's eight to an order and they're practically a meal on their own. We were pleased to find these weren't overcooked or greasy, a common mistake.   My only complaint is I wish there were more vegetables.   As for the noodles, you can pick the width (really thin, really wide,  somewhere in between, insert your dirty jokes here). We went with the standard C noodles.   While they were fresh and delicious, the beef was just OK. I also wish the XO delivered a little more heat as promised, but nothing a little chili oil can't fix. Next time, I'll ask for them extra spicy!   Can we also talk about the portion sizes here? Between a heaping plate of noodles and behemoth dumplings, we were able to take home leftovers that heated up perfectly the next day for lunch.   Prices are similar to what those corporate Asian food establishments charge, but it's obviously so much better.   Sit by the window and you're in for a real show. So much fun to watch all the noodles being hand stretched!   Already plotting another trip to this little slice of home on Dobson and Warner to work my way through that extensive menu.   Yay, I'm a fan indeed!

Just another corporate yogurt place.   Every time I've been to the Chandler Whole Foods in this same shopping center, I'd drive past Orange Leaf and remind myself I still needed to try the place.  Well, Friday night, finally stopped in here.   Nice, open spacious set up. Comfy padded chairs. Brightly lit and seemed clean.   Huge variety of flavors that night (17), two dairy free options and one NSA with cute names like "Snickerdoodle: Tastes as happy as it sounds!" and "Pineapple: Don't let the spikes fool you, it's tasty!"  If there's one thing I despise about self-serve yogurt joints it's sample cup hoarders. Oh, you say your shop's going green? Just stop, please. Especially if there's no recycling bin or reusable containers available for purchase!   It's even more annoying when you have to ask for them and an employee looks at you like you just murdered their first born.   The disgruntled employee (who didn't greet anyone, by the way, she looked like she was in sheer pain) gave us each one. Yes, one each. Hello, dispenser contamination! Gross.   You run a yogurt shop; customers want to try your product. Just put a bin of cups out like everyone else does.   As far as the yogurt goes, it was great. I mixed pineapple and coconut together, two flavors I can never seem to find! Dude had the Snickerdoodle, which yes, tasted as happy as it sounds.   Toppings bar is kind of weak, and the fruit didn't seem fresh. Great variety of Boba flavors though, most I've seen in the area.   With froyo shops on almost every corner in the Valley, not sure I'd go out of my way to come here again.

Started using Arizona Business Forms at work in February 2011; heard about them through our Company President's Executive Assistant.   I worked with Gary Williams to create cards for our Business Reply Mail account. Superb customer service; he was beyond helpful in working with the bureaucracy that is the US Postal Service. All with a smile on his face! A positive attitude goes a long way, and clearly Gary recognizes this.  Every order has been completed in a timely manner, and sometimes I'll receive a shipment well before the date promised. Best of all, the price is right.   As long as this keeps up, we'll continue using ABF.   Actually about to call them now for some graphic design assistance for a logo I'm working on.   ABF is an exceptional company and I never hesitate to recommend them to anyone asking about commercial printing and design.

Paletas Betty has the finest Mexican Popsicles that will ever grace your mouth!   I know you're thinking, "It's a popsicle. What more are you expecting?" Stay with me.   Everything is made daily in small batches, and you won't find any preservatives, funky food coloring or canned fruits in any of their products.   In fact, you'll find whole chunks of fruit in many of the paletas!   I often come by after a rip roaring, beer-swilling time at San Tan Brewing Company next door.   So far, my favorites have been the Platano (Bananas Foster), Naranja (Orange Cream) and Piña con Chile.   Also, don't forget to bring home some Perroletas for your doggiehs!   Paletas Betty is the perfect place to cool off and satisfy any sweet tooth craving.

Normally, I wouldn't give a chain eatery four stars. Call me a snob if you will.   Don't get me wrong, Jimmy John's makes some delicious subs. And yes, they're freaky fast, whether you eat in or have it delivered.   Went there a lot in college; still come in from time to time now as I work nearby.  The #12 Beach Club and #13 Gourmet Veggie Sub are my standbys. I also love that they'll lettuce wrap your sandwich for you, which saves a boatload of calories!  While I've been to this location several times, it's the customer service I received today that stands out.  Gabby helped me place a catering order for a Women's Leadership Council I'm a part of.   We have a lot of members that have dietary restrictions or food allergies, and Gabby was extremely patient with me as I read off all our custom boxed lunch orders. Good on her, I probably would have lost my cool.   I will often help with catering orders for trainings, meetings, etc. the company I work for hosts, so it's good to know I can rely on Jimmy Johns to feed our hungry guys that work out in the field for trainings, sales meetings, or anything else we may have here.   Ray and 54th Street Jimmy Johns: Y'all kick ass!

You know those nights you can't be bothered to cook?   Or put on makeup? Or blow out your hair? Or put on a bra? Or take off those Yoga pants that are comfortably plastered to your behind?   This was me on a Saturday night after competing in a Track and Field meet in Coolidge earlier that day. And it seemed Andrew C. was on the same page after an extended day at work.  "Why not Thai food?" I remember Monica O. and Cheryl B. had raved about Thai Chili, so I pulled up the menu.   Turns out they do take-out! YES, LOW MAINTENANCE EVENING!  We called and ordered the Mussamun Curry with chicken at Thai Hot level 8, and the Drunken Noodles with chicken at Thai Hot level 6.  Made the trek out to Gilbert. Friendly cashier, and she gladly accepted the 5% off your order with a Yelp check-in. Seems like they do a lot of carry out here, but there was a nice dining area.   This stuff smelled heavenly. Was practically drooling on the drive home.   Got home, popped open a bottle of wine and our to-go containers.  Holy smokes, this stuff was HOT. Like, open the containers and your eyes start running hot.   The Mussaman Curry was my favorite of the two. Beautiful, rich, creamy orange color. Savory coconut milk, tender chicken, carrots and potatoes. The only weird thing was the potatoes seemed to have this funky taste, like they were freeze dried.  While the Drunken Noodles were delish and a good balance of chicken and vegetables, the dish didn't seem to be very saucy. Dry, almost.   Also, ironically, the Drunken Noodles which we ordered at a lower heat level than the Mussaman Curry were unbearably hot (at least for me)! Maybe they mixed them up?   Either way, it was reasonably priced and a great discovery. I anticipate we'll be back again and again . . . Lazy night in or nice night out!

I WAS a Dim Sum Virgin ... Until Monica O. posted February's Breakfast Club UYE at Mekong Palace.   I clicked "I'm in!" and off I went on a Saturday to finally validate that Dim Sum V-Card.    So this place is in a mall food court; however, once our group of 10 got situated, I barely noticed.   Glad we had Norm with us for guidance, because I sure as Heck wouldn't have a clue what to do!   My favorites were the BBQ Pork Steamed Buns, the squid and one of the noodle dishes.   We tried what seemed like an endless parade of different plates. I know I definitely left quite full. So you can imagine my surprise when we each paid $13 after tip!   Really enjoyed the company and of course, the food. Look forward to coming back in the future ... And trying Hot Pot!

Yoasis is a great Mom and Pop froyo shop, and it's just what this part of "booniesville" Ahwatukee needed.   There aren't too many of them in this area, either, so it's nice not to have to support one of the giant chains nearby that aren't that great (Orange Leaf, Zoyo, etc.).   This is where I got my froyo fix while living here four years ago. Now I only drop by if I'm house/dog sitting for my family ... Or had if I had some dental work done across the street like last night!   The flavors are always rich, creamy and delicious. Multiple non dairy, sugar free and non fat options for everyone. Not sure about gluten free, though.  The names are cute too: Cabo Cake Batter, Matzatlan Milk Chocolate, Manele Bay Mint, Riviera Red Velvet, etc. I love when they bring back pumpkin spice around Halloween!  A while back we asked one of the employees if they make their product in house (like my favorite place in Tempe, Aloha Yogurt).   Turns out, it's mixes from cartons. Bummer, dudes.   The place is consistently clean. I just wish there was a little more variety of Boba, fruit, etc. on the toppings bar since there's so much candy, syrups, cookies, cakes, cereals, etc.   Most recently I got their Non Dairy Pineapple with a splash of Pomegranate Sorbet and some fruit toppings. Crackhead combo? Yes. Tasty? Definitely!  Dude got a standby, Mint and Chocolate swirled.  Yoasis now also offers Gelato (haven't tried) and Yoghund yogurts for your fur children. My dog, Halo, absolutely flips for these treats!  Little more pricey than other shops in the area at .43 per ounce. Don't forget to get a punch card!   Give Yoasis a try, you won't regret it!

Dude and I were seeking Pumpkins for our annual Halloween tradition: "Create the most ridiculous carving you can come up with!"  *2015's creations were a Dave Grohl and a Donald Trump-O-Lantern!*  I'm lazy and usually just get them from a grocery store. Well this year I got OBSCENELY lazy being out of town almost all of October, and couldn't find one. :(   Never fear... Yelp Almighty directed us to Mother Nature's Farm.  Now obviously we don't have any little ones so we didn't check out the attractions beyond picking two GIANT pumpkins - Pretty reasonably priced for $15 a pop!   The place was pretty cute for just a farm off the road, and we took a couple of obnoxious fall pictures.   If you're looking for quality pumpkins at just about any size next year, stop in. Heck, bring your little ones for the hayride too!

A craft beer oasis in South Tempe. No really, if you want a special brew, it's likely on tap. And right down the street from my house; how did I overlook you for so long?!   I used to live in Fort Collins, CO and LOVE that Flanny's has New Belgium beers galore. The boyfriend and I stopped in last Saturday. I enjoyed two Trippels, and a beer infusion called Candy Apple (Sonoran White Chocolate + Crispin Cider = OMGHOLY$#!T!). Also, it's awesome that some of the money from the purchase of an infusions goes to Brain Cancer research. Believe this was called "Beer for Brains".  Knock a star off for the food. Nothing special; it's bar food. But the appetizers we ordered had me sick as hell and my Sunday morning wasn't a good time.  I'll definitely come back!

Listen, my Yelp brothers and sisters.  If you haven't seen our very own Brian "Nucks" N.'s comedy troupe The [SIC] Sense perform, what the serious f!@# is your problem?!  Ahem, I mean, what are you waiting for?!   Had the pleasure of attending their Holiday Show with Homegirl Extraordinaire Missy F., at the Scottsdale Comedy Spot, and it was a great time.   If you're easily offended, I'd recommend skipping this - Heck, one of their holiday parody songs caught *me* off guard, but didn't stop me from enjoying myself.   If you have a sick, twisted and raunchy sense of humor, you will enjoy.   And for the love of Kraken, please leave your kids at home.   Can't wait for the next one! :)

Ok, let's just get this out of the way:   Wang's Delight ... The "Pervy 14-year-old boy" part of my personality is busting up laughing right now!   *Responsible, functional adult part chimes in*  "Sheesus, Meg, act your age already!"  Anyway, the food here. Unimpressed! Especially since a few of my coworkers used to go here often, enjoyed it and highly recommended it.   Found their menu in a drawer one night. I wasn't going to cook, Dude was working late, Chinese it is! *Ahem, swear I'm more domestic than takeout ...*  Ordered the Mongolian Beef and Chicken Lo Mein. After tip I think this averaged out to be a little over $15.   Both dishes were overly oily, mushy and lacking any kind of spice or character. Kind of like those microwaveable Tai Pei Asian food meals (or whatever the name is) I would scarf down in college.   Not so sure I'm going to rush back and try them again.  Sorry Wang's, I  just wasn't delighted with your cuisine.

In a town full of strip malls and chain eateries, Public House Garage is just what Ahwatukee needed.   Roll up garage doors with a variety of seating options, and not to mention a great patio for our cooler days.   There's plenty of TVs to catch almost any game.  The week my Dad had a quadruple bypass, I was neglecting my own needs running back and forth from the hospital.   By the time Sunday rolled around, I  didn't realize how friggin' hungry I was!   Dude was off work early, and dragged my butt here.   I can't remember exactly what we ate, but know it was some kind of BBQ Bacon Burger with the Shoestring Fries.   Solid burger, but nothing unique or out of this world.  We didn't do any drinking; however, looks like they had plenty of tap handles and a nice looking Bloody Mary Bar.   I look forward to a trip back to Public House Garage for Happy Hour, or just a beer with friends!

This may be my favorite Oregano's location. Even better the ASU Oregano's and definitely trumps the Elliot one closer to our home.   Seriously, the food at Oregano's is consistently delicious no matter which one you go to. But the Germann and Dobson location serves up more than great food. We're talking customer service, here!   We came here on a Monday night back in July for Dude's birthday *cough, OLD MAN! cough*. Normally I love me some air conditioning; however, I had just took a shower and was fuh-reezing. Patio it is. Two high power mister fans out there.   Our server AJ was a total sweetheart even though it was her day before her weekend began. Suggested some great drinks to us, the D'Liscious Rootbear float for Dude, and Red Sangria for me.   I'm not a big rum girl, but Dude had to put his beverage on lockdown after I took a few sips! So good. You can skip the pizza cookie if you're so inclined and just get this as dessert.   We ordered one of our usuals, the Oregano's Favorite Salad (Jr. Size) and the Big Rig Pasta with Sausage. Plenty of spice! And apparently, they fly in the sausage from Chicago. That explains a few things.   To garner herself a nice tip, AJ hooked Dude up with a free white chocolate macadamia nut pizza cookie for his birthday. Half baked goodness! They're definitely meant for four people . . . But let's be honest, we weren't exactly "behaving" in the dietary sense that night.   Thanks for making it a great birthday, Oregano's and AJ!

Los Dos Molinos doesn't know how to do mild. But if you like it hot, woweee this is your place!   Service is slightly spotty; however, I always have a great time when going here.   They make one mean margarita here. Had a blast with Missy F. with Dude as our DD once!   Love their green and red salsa. Just a tip, the first bowl of chips is complimentary. After that, you get charged.   Of the three times I've been here, only have tried the green and red chile platter with beef, and my favorite: the Machaca burrito.   Worth paying extra for sour cream as this is melt your face off status . . . Right, Miss?! And it's big enough to share.   It's been a long time since my last visit, and will have to drop into LDM for either dinner or drinks soon when I'm in the Tuke.   Recommended!

Just your standard self-serve yogurt place. Get your samples, add fruit toppings or whatever crackhead combo of candy, cake, syrup, etc. you want, and pay per ounce!    So why the five stars, then, you ask?   Sour apple frozen yogurt. WINNING, DUH! Nowhere else seems to have this flavor and it was amazing!   Also, it was nice to see calorie counts by the ounce listed.

I discovered this place through Shannon Sorrels' column in the Ahwatukee Foothills News. Reading it, two things came to mind:  1. "Whoa! This lady is SNARKY, no BS approach to health and fitness . . .  and I liiiikkkke it! I'm surprised the AFN EdBoard even RUNS this!"  2. I want to see if this is the real deal (not just hype) and try some workouts.   I check out the website, and signed up for the free week trial - well, more like, I took two classes because I was in the middle of re-locating to my new home in Chandler.  Now I'm kicking myself wishing I had saved it for this week. :(   $150/month is a little pricey for me (I graduated from college two years ago, and just getting started in my career - gotta love them bills! And my current gym works with my budget.) - But the day I can afford it, I - WILL - be moving over to this gym.   With the certification Shannon and her staff have (NSCA =  the hardest to obtain, and they aren't the joke personal trainers running around LA Fitness, etc), I KNOW it will be a worthwhile investment.   I was a NCAA Division I Track and Field athlete, and by no means a lazy person. Fitness is a huge part of my life still; I'm trying to avoid becoming a couch potato and overweight like many athletes do post-college. With that, I know what an assbeating of a workout looks like. The circuit Shannon put us through was definitely a "Come to Jesus" moment on some levels!   Safe to say, no hype. Check it out! :)

So I came back and gave Physix another go in August/September 2012.   After committing to giving hammer throwing another four years, working out 6 days a week with my Coach, this time it was only for the nutrition side of the equation.   At this point, I was coping wtih surgically induced hypothyroidism. Throw in my first years in good ol' Corporate 'Merica, being severely overweight for my 5'4" frame (and for once muscle mass wasn't the culprit) - So it was especially important to look at this.   Shannon Sorrels and I sat down and discussed what my goals are in regard to throwing and weight loss. I set a goal of losing 34 pounds. Seeing my starting weight was horrifying, and thankfully the last time I'd ever have to see it.   You keep a food log to hold yourself accountable and see exactly how many calories, carbs, fat, protein you're consuming. Hah, yeah right. But Physix uses a wonderful nutrition and weight loss support company called DotFit (check it out - www.dotfit.com).   Shannon will review your logs weekly and send you a screencast as she goes through it. You read that correctly. Accountability at its finest, baby! No more hiding that mid-afternoon Starbucks run, Friday night wine orgy or PMS gelato attack.   Prior to having thyroid surgery, I never paid any mind to counting calories. Weight gain was never a serious problem for me as an athlete. Also thought it was bogus and a great path to developing an eating disorder.  Well, this just in: Restricting calories at or below what you need to run your body WORKS. Simple math, simple Physics. Please don't drop that starvation mode line, because that's the world's biggest lie. Eating more won't activate weight loss. Hah, activate . . .   During my 21-day trial, I actually lost four pounds in my first week.   The weight is coming off slowly, but I'm learning to be patient and stay the course no matter how glacial the process is. See, a whacked out thyroid is beyond my control. What I shove my face with is firmly within my control. I can't rely on the intense daily workouts from Coach Hanrahan to completely take the excess weight off.   Since July 13, 2012 (before my trial) I've lost a total of 30 pounds - 23 of them from the program Shannon started for me. The proof is in the picture attached to this review - they're exactly a year apart!   I'm now 11 pounds away from my goal. Looking forward to not only a slimmer figure, but increased speed in the hammer ring! Almost to that "19 year-old-Meagan weight" and feeling daaaammmnnnnnnn good about it!  Wish I could have continued working with Shannon as the accountability was a huge piece for me. She genuinely wants to see her clients succeed, a rare quality in personal trainers these days. But, at the end of the day, my hammer coach is the only one I can afford to pay.   If you truly want to change your lifestyle forever, how you view food and not just lose the weight - RUN, do NOT walk to Physix! An education about what works is what's important, and that's what I took away from my experience.  Go to www.AZPhysix.com and add yourself to the newsletter for the 21-day free trial. You will not regret it.

Had to come back and update this review.   I come by this Starbucks more often than I'd like to admit; it's by work. Will swing by once a week or so, and will have meetings here in the afternoon with my throws coach as it's close to the gym.   Let's be honest: NO Starbucks is five stars. They're a dime a dozen, and you probably know what a "good experience" at a "good Starbucks" is like.   Theresa, however, is what makes this place! And her team of awesome ladies!   Always a huge smile on her face, even at 5:15/30 AM.   Remembers me by name and follows up on previous conversations we've had. Knows my drink (Grande Pikes Place, no added sweetener), unless I go off into the deep end and order something crazy!   The customer service here is the only why I'm upping the rating two stars.  Well done, Chandler and Kyrene team! :)

Listen, ladies.   We're all aware aesthetics are important - In our homes and how we choose (or choose not) to present ourselves.   But if you're looking for a "Pinterest Worthy" interior design to your wax salon as a measurement of how good the services are - I'm here to deliver an important message.   Warning - Sit down. Shock, denial, confusion may occur:  You're doing it wrong. Oh so wrong, sweetheart.  When molten hot wax is being dumped all over my face / lady parts and hairs are being forcefully evicted from their follicles at lightspeed, the last thing on my mind is, "Like OMG Becky, look at that chevron accent wall! So clutch!"   European Wax Center is a place where no hair is safe.   Clean, bright and efficient design while still maintaining a level of "aesthetic appeal", they do one thing and one thing well: Waxing.   No facials. No massages. No skincare consultations.   Go to a Pinterest inspired salon if you need that, or better yet, your local board certified dermatologist.  Evict those pesky hairs. Bright lights and meticulous Wax Specialists assure just that.  And the patented comfort wax? Let me tell you something.  After experiencing this, you'll never go back to suspect honey wax with paper strips ever again.   It hurts less, and your skin is far less red and irritated.  I've been seeing Claudine for over three years now, and I'll never let anyone come near my eyebrows or downstairs area again to remove hair!  She is such an awesome person, fun to chat with and truly a veteran at waxing.  Anytime I get a Brazilian ($47), I know there'll be no hair left behind. Claudine is efficient while still being meticulous. 15-30 minutes later, you're back to whatever it was you were doing!  By the way, the exfoliant and ingrown hair serum products here are incredible and certainly worth a try if you do any bikini wax service.  And can we talk about how much of an ARTIST she is with eyebrows ($18)?! My goodness.   I leave with perfectly shaped brows, every time, fail proof.  She also taught me about / how to apply brow powders when I first started going to her.   I avoided them (and similar products like gels and pencils) for years thinking it'd give me that overly dark tattooed brow look, but let's face it ladies - Pretty is a *learned skill* like riding a bike.   If you can master the brow powder fill, you'll never take another "invisible eyebrow" photo again.   Why spend $18+ on your brows to look like a Basic Betty. Juuuuuuuust sayin'!   Everyone I've encountered up front or on the phone have been incredibly friendly and helpful. Allie and Jazmin are fun gals!  Sure, they can be pushy about the money saving Wax Pass plans, but is it that hard to just say no to a hard sell and move about your day?   Normally, I'm all about supporting local businesses for my beauty needs, but EWC sets the industry standard by doing one thing and doing it well.   Pinterest chandeliers be damned.  So recommended.  If you want to check it out for yourself, stop in for a free or discounted service today and ask for Claudine!  And please shoot me a PM for the referral. ;)

Fantastic experience with Global Bike!   Came in here on a Sunday with my Pops. My14-year-old brother (an avid mountain biker) had been saving up for a Specialized Rock Hopper and Pops agreed to help him make up the costs somewhere due to good grades, working, etc. Nice parents, brah!  Wanting to surprise the kid, Pops and I made it look like we were going to the grocery store to pick up some goods for Sunday dinner, so Ryan had no idea.   We walk in and Dustin immediately greets us and asks what we were looking for.   Turns out, they were out of the bike both for the height he needed and color (he's 6 foot and GROWING). What does Pops do?!   Buys a Specialized CRAVE. One top of the line sick looking pair of wheels!   Didn't try to sell an additional services or anything; however, the tune-up offer in a month was a great touch. All the guys were super knowledgeable.  Paid and loaded it into my car.   When we got back to my family's house, I told Ryan to help me unload a case of water.   He walked outside, and there was his bike! Wish I could have filmed the reaction because he was ecstatic! Warmed my heart for sure to help with a nice surprise ... Even if he does owe Pops buku bucks now.   Overall, I loved the feel of the shop. Reminded me of Road 34 in Fort Collins, CO ... All they needed was a bar with some local brews on tap.   Really regret selling my mountain bike when I moved down here from Colorado.   After the customer service I experienced today, I will definitely stop by Global Bike on my hunt for a new ride in the next 4-6 months.

Back in January, I really wanted to check out Jeniza Nails.  Very close to my house, the salon appeared to be very beautiful and clean, reasonable prices and amazing pictures of their work on Yelp.   I heeded reviewers' advice to book an appointment in advance, so on a Thursday, I called and booked a gel manicure and a spa pedicure no problem at all.   Saturday, January 10th 2015 comes around, and after meeting up with friends for breakfast and a hard day of training at the gym, I was ready for some pampering.   First off, I love it when these types of nail salons accept appointments - As someone who is unabashedly Type A . . . AWESOME!   But can you stick to them? Most can't. I sat in the cramped waiting area for almost 20 minutes past the set time.   That's OK though, I get that sometimes appointments can run over. So during that time I was able to scope out and pick from their vast collection of gel and regular polishes, and best believe, Jeniza has quite the stash.   Finally get called back to a nail station, and I don't get a hello, what's your name, etc. from my technician. Just one of the dirtiest looks I've ever received from someone in a nail salon.   Was it because I was decked out in yoga pants with a hoodie and no make-up? I tend to notice the customer service I receive is a bit on the doucherific side when I don't wear make-up, which says a LOT about our society. Give me freakin' break, I was there to relax, and had showered.   At any rate, I had to ask her name to learn it was Debbie.   While she did beautiful work, it was very uncomfortable with the awkward glares and minimal conversation.   "What kind of shape?"  "Squoval."  "Shorter?"  "Sure."  *aggressively busts out nail clippers and goes to town!*  And don't even get me started about the technicians engaging in a diss session about a very pregnant client that had been in earlier in the day.   Fully inappropriate in the presence of clients. I'm not going to pretend this never happens in any business, but please have a modicum of professionalism and do so privately amongst yourselves.   The tools that were used on my hands were pulled out of a drawer, and not from a sterilized package.   Also, whirlpool jets, I won't even get started on why those things are absolutely filthy and a health hazard.   While the salon is beautiful, the work is solid and the colors selection is vast, risking my health  and the lack of respect isn't worth a return visit.   There are plenty of other nail establishments in the Valley that won't treat their paying customers like an absolute inconvenience or openly trash talk them.   Two stars for Debbie's beautiful work . . . That's it.   This is only my experience. Read the reviews, view the photos and make an informed decision.

In August of 2011, Oregano's Pizza Bistro did South Tempe a solid and decided to give this area a location. Woohoo! And unlike the other locations, there's loads of available parking here.   I actually came here with my coworkers for the grand opening. Dude and I have enjoyed many a dinner out on the awesome patio during the "Winter" (come on, Arizonans . . . ), taken our out of town friends here.   Usually, we'll just get a Big Rig with Spicy Sausage and an Oregano's Favorite Salad to-go.   Our friend was recently relocated to Arizona (go Army, thank a soldier today) and since his immediate family is currently out of town, we pulled it together to give him a nice welcome home.   Six plus months with no pizza meant we were dragging Vinny's ass right to Oreganos.  Our server handled our party with style! Forgot her name, but she was a gal from San Diego. Hooked Vinny up with a free beer. And don't forget their delicious Boom Dip . . . Spinach Artichoke Dip with warm "Italian Chips".   The three of us split the always delicious Numero One-O pizza! My sister in law got the Alfredo the Dark, mom and father in law each got the Big Rig, chicken and sausage.  And the obligatory pizza cookie. Which is totally meant for 4-6 people. Hello!   Was the food great? Of course! Mentioned it before, no matter which location you go to, the food is consistently delicious and at that point it's the service that counts.   Score one Oregano's for supporting our troops, and giving our friend an awesome night back in town.   We'll keep going to this location!

This Safeway is much larger than the Desert Foothills and Chandler Boulevard location, wider variety of produce and other products. Newly renovated. Very clean. Even the bathrooms, hah!  I don't even live in this area anymore, and still find myself shopping here! What the heck?!  Probably doesn't help that it's near work and the gym.   Super convenient for picking up last minute ingredients I need for dinner that night, heck, even just changing out of my sweat drenched clothes from a workout if I have a "Pain and Torture appointment" with my Physical TERRORIST "friend" right down the street . . .   There's also a Starbucks here for all you coffee freaks. The nicest lady works there. Knows my drink now. Sometimes I don't even have to tell her unless I'm changing it up. Oh yeah!   Friendly employees, convenient, and overall a pleasant shopping experience so obviously I'll be back.

The Phoenix Ale Brewery is nothing fancy.  A taproom with some tables and chairs and a bar.   Oh, please. You didn't come here ambiance - You're here for some delicious beer!  And really, if you're one of those types who NEEDS grub to complete your brewery experience, quit your bitchin' and head down to their new location that has a kitchen.   Actually, I lied, this location has Panini available. Or just bring your own grub in.   Andrew C. hosted his February "Brews Cruisin' the Valley with Dude UYE" here, and we had an excellent afternoon with a group of Yelpers. Marisa S. was a doll as always and crafted some lovely cheese, meat and fruit boards for us to enjoy!   We took the bus and light rail all the way from North Chandler so we could both imbibe with the lovely Groupon we had - Two Flights, Two Pints and Two Crowlers (32oz Growler Cans).   Buckle up, taste buds!   We've tried the always refreshing Watermelon Ale and Biltmore Blonde previously, so it was fun to finally sample their other offerings at the source.   What do I remember whilst pickling my brain in alcohol that fine afternoon?   Well, I definitely remember trying the seasonal Cranberry Oatmeal Stout. That was a real treat! Definitely a heavier bodied beer.   As an IPA lover, I was surprisingly not a fan of the Camelback IPA; even more shocking, IPA hatin' Dude LOVED IT.   Fell in LOVE with their West Coast IPA, the Orange Peel. That beer was sweet, citrusy, hops-filled joy in your MOUTH, aka, Dude hated it.   Ended up choosing this one as my full pint.   To round out the Groupon, we took home Crowlers filled with Biltmore Blonde and Fretzy's American Hefeweizen.  I also must complement the bartender who handled our group with ease and kept our beers full - We were the largest group in the house that day.   We haven't made it back yet, but I'm looking forward to another afternoon at Phoenix Ale.  Please check them out if you haven't yet!

Thirsty Lion is a great place to grab a few drinks after work on a Friday afternoon!   Alyssa R., another coworker, a former coworker and I are all off work by 2PM on Friday's, so this place was a convenient location to mingle.   Comfy and unpretentious atmosphere, this is definitely a laid back place to chill.  We sat in the bar area. Big, leather backless stools. It gets a smidgen noisy in there, but it didn't deter our group from enjoyable conversation . . . And perhaps contributing to said noise level, oops!  What did I notice right away? The draft beer selection. Holy whack, I think there were like 45!   I ended up drinking a Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA and a Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter.   Obviously they were freaking delicious because the pints disappeared immediately.   Oh, and because Von paid. Free alcohol is always good - Unless you're in a frat house after the age of 21. HAH!   As for the culinary delights, we only ordered a massive plate of nachos to keep the schwasted-ness at bay.  It was on-par with what I'd expect for bar food: Not horrible, not amazing, yet edible.  Good work, team, I'll be baaaaaaacccck!

Nothing but good things to say about this place!   I actually came here on my Mom's recommendation. This is her regular OBGYN; she's also had two surgeries by two different physicians here (Dr. Mayer and Dr. Crawford).  I see both Dr. Crawford and Laura Rutledge (Women's Health Nurse Practitioner) . . . mostly Laura though. Everyone is very competent, and I've never had a poor experience. Wait time is as short as it gets; every visit has been completed in a timely manner while still being thorough and answering any questions. Easy to get refills on your birth control.   Laura is actually the one that located the nodule on my thyroid this summer. If it weren't for her, I'd still be walking around with a golf ball full of God-knows-what in my neck.   Maybe it's a little extreme to say this, but I'd trust these people with my life. No, I'm not joking . . .   My Mom came close to dying in 2003 from some serious post-surgical complications and an out of control infection that seemed to have no end in sight. Absolutely horrifying. During this time, Dr. Mayer was an absolute angel to my Dad and the rest of the family. Thank you for keeping our Mom alive, Dr. Mayer!   I can't speak about prenatal care or labor and delivery.   For all of these reasons, I never hesitate to recommend Maricopa OBGYN to any family, friends or random Yelpers that may message me about MOGA!

Can't wait to come back to Vintage 95 for a date night!  Very romantic atmosphere, lots of comfy furniture, and live music on weekends.  Sarah R. and I tried a glass of the Coto de Hayas from Spain. Believe it was the Tempranillo Cabernet? Memory a little hazy, this was our last stop after a night of drinks.   Would totally order the bottle, though.   Their wine selection is pretty extensive, lots of $5/glass options, and I know within a certain timeframe, you get a charcuterie board if you purchase a bottle.   Full bar for all those that aren't wine lovers.   Throw this one in your back pocket for date night, guys!

So let's get one thing straight.   I'm a HUGE nail junkie. At a minimum, I "have" to get a pedicure once a month. Shellac manicures are nice too, but not a requirement.   Been going to this amazing lady at a higher end salon (where I get my hair done) for four years. While she's worth every cent, and the fun conversations, the high price tag began to take a beating on my wallet.   It's totally possible for us nail junkies to look fabulous and still have a decent checking account, que no?   Enter Nail eNV.   Homegirl Extraordinaire Missy F. has been going here for quite some time, and brought me along for a birthday pedicure.   Been hooked ever since!   For the most part, this establishment seems clean.   While I'm still  squicked out by the whirlpool jets (you folks do you know how nasty those things can be, right?!), it's comforting to see the technicians are opening a fresh, sealed pack of tools every time you jump in the chair.   Lani gives the most amazing foot massages, Karen and Mimi are freaking artists when it comes to nail couture (see my pics). I saw Mai most recently, and she gave a very thorough pedicure. Plus, a she's a total sweetheart!   I have never been upsold, and thank goodness, because that's what keeps me away from these places to begin with.   Decent prices too; the Express Pedicure is $17 and the Spa Pedicure is $25. Splurge for the Spa Pedicure, that hot stone massage age is fabulous.   Pro Tip: Pay with cash and get a punch card. Pay cash on 10 visits of the same service, get 40% off the 11th!   Regular polish selection seems small; however, it appears that Nail enV has a massive selection of CND Shellac and Gelish Polish Colors behind the nail bar. Wowee!   My only suggestions:   1) Tub liners  2) Stop playing the music so damn loud. Find a middle of the road option so everyone is happy I get the party atmosphere y'all are aiming for, but sometimes folks just want to relax and read a book while the feet get pampered.  Thanks for keeping my feet from turning into weapons, Nail eNV!

This is the Dutch Bros closest my house, so will come here a lot after a run / walk on the canal trails.   Not much difference than the other locations. Talkative, friendly baristas, quick service, delicious coffee.   Your Dutch Mafia stamp card should be the most important punch card in your wallet.   Ever heard of Two-Stamp Tuesdays?! Well now you have, so no more excuses. They also did Three-Stamp Tuesday on New Year's Day this year. Perfect for that lovely post party hangover.   Like the Dutch Bros close to ASU, if there's a long line, someone comes out to take your order, so all you have to do is pay and grab your coffee at the window. Efficiency at its finest . . . Beat that, Corporate Coffee Central.   Also, shout out to the sweet gal who gave me a free Kicker coffee on my birthday! So awesome.    If you're in this part of Tempe, bypass Starbucks and shake up your routine a little.

Dieters beware: Big Boys Pizza will be your worst nightmare.   ... Or dream come true. Hee hee hee!  Dude and I have only ordered twice from this place, but seriously some of the best pizza I've tried in the area.   Great price for a "small" two topping pizza.  Yes, these babies are MONSTERS!  Yes, it's rather greasy. In a good way of course. I warned y'all! Somehow though, both times the crust has been perfectly crisp and not soggy like you would expect.  Also, the employees here are hilarious.  Recommended. Now I have to remember to actually come back next time we want pizza!

Umm, if I re-gain those 50+ pounds I left behind, I'm going to have to blame ATL Wings.   Not really, but that should give you an idea of how addictively delicious these wings are!   2013 and 2014 Winner of Wingstock, and rightfully so.   Huge, quality, meaty wings and solid wing sauce flavors at a great price ... What more could you ask for?   Oh yes, beer!   They don't have a liquor license just yet. Everytime we've stopped in, it's been take-out, so I just throw back a few San Tan Hefs at home.   You will, however find Red, Blue and Purple Kool-Aid on Tap!   My favorite flavors so far: Hot, Extreme Honey Habanero and Cajun Hot.   Knock off a star for the occasional rude customer service. It all depends on who is working the counter that day. Dude and I have encountered some serious trolls.  Oh, and for closing rather early. If they stayed open an hour later each day, I'm sure ATL would get even more business from late night drinkers seeking some munchies.  Stop by ATL Wings and get your wing fix, you won't be disappointed!

When I moved close by last year, my Mom, sister and I were doing a coffee run when we drove past La Fonda.   A Flagstaff resident, she screamed, "Whoa that place is good Meg! You need to go."   So a year later, I finally tried it.   Let's just be upfront right now: This is NOT the same La Fonda near Northern Arizona University. No connection whatsoever.   Now that that's cleared up, the food was just OK. Not the best quality.  Dude and I shared the Pollo Especial Fundido Burrito. Shredded chicken with spiced red and green sauce, topped with Fundido sauce and melted cheese.   Not impressed at all, kind of like On the Border and lacking the promised heat (spice).  Delicious silver margarita though, and our server Priscilla took great care of us, so two stars for that.

Chandler's Best Donuts - A local business worth supporting. The best donuts anywhere.   So why on God's Green Earth would you hit up Dunkin Donuts after savoring the goodness that's Golden Donuts & Smoothies?   I've only been in once; however, I've had donuts twice.  The first time was when Dude had to break a twenty, so he brought home two Old Fashioned Krullers.  Super fresh; crunch to the outside but melt in your mouth in the middle. Simple and delicious.   Today, I dropped by after a few errands. Picked up an Old Fashioned Kruller for Dude, a Vanilla Frosted for me, and a Thai Iced Tea.  Vanilla Frosted was your typical standard donut, but still good.   What really stood out was the Thai Iced Tea. Absolutely phenom! Put this in my Top 3 Best Thai Iced Teas list.   All this for just a little over $5. And Keep in mind, if your purchase is under $3 . . . cash only.   The customer service was a little on the brusk side; however, I will continue to visit GD when that occasional craving for donuts strikes.   Matter of fact, think I'll swing by tomorrow morning to pick up a box for a Monday Meeting.   With the Yelp check in of buy a dozen get six free, how could you go wrong?!

Babbo is quite delicious for Americanized Italian food with fantastic service to boot.  We came in here back in August after spending the day doing maintenance + giving my ride a serious wash, polish and wax job. It was after 9PM, I was sunburnt, exhausted, and cooking was the last thing on my mind.  So Dude drags me here.   Very cute décor inside, loved the bubble-glass lamps!   So it looks all snazzy inside. If you feel like Babbo is a place you have to dress up . . . Don't. I was wearing a sundress and wedges; Dude had on shorts and a shirt, and the other diners seemed to reflect this theme.   Even though it was close to closing time, our server (looked like a college-aged gal) didn't show she was ready to hit the road. Very talkative, friendly, and made plenty of recommendations to us.  In fact, made it a point to bring us freshly made and baked ciabatta bread with an olive oil and balsamic reduction. Carb heaven!   The Caesar salads were your typical restaurant salad fare.   I ordered the Pasta Martini (essentially a penne a la vodka) and Dude had the Chicken Chipotle Pasta.   We both LOVE spicy food, and our server told us the chef could make these dishes extra spicy for us. And boy, did s/he bring the heat! Also, no problem substituting the chicken in my pasta with spicy Italian sausage.   After tip, no dessert, soda or alcoholic beverages, this was just over $25.   Was it the best pasta? Definitely not. But so much better than Olive Garden, Carrabbas, or the other garbage-y chains.   Great to know that Babbo exists when I want a quick, affordable casual dinner.

Fantastic experience with Rehab Burger Therapy from start to finish!   With lots of work travel and Dude starting a new job, we missed out on holding a get together for his birthday with all the Yelpmigos in July.   He decided on this joint, so away I went to post a UYE!   When I saw our guest list hit 21, I was a little concerned about being able to get a reservation on a Friday night in a smaller venue.   Wiley the owner made it happen and was nothing short of freakin' delightful and pleasant.   Rehab's team had a space set up for us upon arrival. I loved the stoner and surfer vibe of the place, brought me right back to Santa Cruz, CA.   David was our one and only server for our massive group, and MAN he ran the show like a boss. Did not miss a beat with the food and drink orders, hilarious guy - and was a hit with my younger sister!   Which, since she accurately guessed his age (and was underage), guess who got to drink the "shot prize"? Thanks, Lolo, for fueling your big sister's night of liver killing! ;)   As for the food, absolutely delicious.   Dude ordered the Ghost Burger, which I got to take a bite of. Ghost Peppers, yes, but not so blazing your face hurts.   I decided to live ridiculously, and ordered the Rehab size (smaller) PB&J Burger after reading Mar L.'s review. Bacon and sriracha also included.  Don't knock it before you try it; this thing was the perfect blend of sweet, salty and savory.   And totally required a fork and knife. Prepare for ooooeeyy goooey messiness, folks.   Wasn't too impressed with the fries; immediately regretted not ordering those Sweet PoTOToes! Next trip . . .   Also, our buddy Joe B. ordered a Reese's Pot Brownie - Which unfortunately wasn't packing actual POT, but came in a giant pot.   Sweet, melty delicious Reese's all wrapped in a brownie with vanilla ice cream, this one is sure to please. Get it if you have a large group to share!   Have to comment about the service, we weren't the only large group. There was a group here having a rehearsal dinner, and not once were there any hiccups.   We had an absolute blast here. Can't wait for my next stint in REHAB!   Thanks Rehab, Wiley, David and Co for making this a fun night for all!

I was referred to Endocrinology Associates by Maricopa OBGYN. The Nurse Practitioner who did my well-woman found a mass on the left side of my thyroid. Oh, well . . . that's just splendid!   I've only had three appointments at this practice, so I don't know if this rating or review is a true indicator of their level of patient care, customer service, etc (can and WILL update this later if need be) . . . but I have nothing but good things to say.   1. Very easy to schedule appointments (including the first one).   2. I've never waited more than 20 minutes past my appointment time. I understand Doctors are BUSY and I'm not the only patient there, so this isn't a huge deal.   3. Medical assistants and office staff aren't a bunch of toolsheds. Thank you for recognizing that it doesn't cost anything to be professional!   4. I was originally sent here to see Dr. Duick; however, that didn't work. I ended up being scheduled to see Dr. Harari (new to the practice). No regrets or hard feelings about that either, because he's great (21 years as a Navy Endocrinelogist).   I have maaaaajor medical anxiety from some childhood trauma / surgeries, and I feel completely comfortable with him. Perhaps that's just the Valium talking I took before my biopsy? Just kidding . . . kind of. ;)   Really though, he has great bedside manner (which is refreshing compared to other physicians and specialists I've seen, ahem!), and has answered any and all questions myself or my family have asked.   Also, he wasn't quick to jump the gun and say, "WHOOOAAA this thing has to come out NOW!" Dr. Harari didn't even look at the reports + scans from AZ Tech Radiology; did an ultrasound himself to check it out. Maybe this is standard, but I sure appreciated his thoroughness.   Recommended.

I'm still very pleased with this practice!   The only real "problem" I've had was trying to get a CD with my Thyroid US on it for the surgeon I had a consult with. Had to call once a week for a month before I finally got a live person. The person in medical records promptly addressed this, and I was able to pick up a CD the following morning.   I had my post-surgery (partial thyroidectomy, 4cm benign nodule) follow-up appointment with Dr. Harari last week. Again, knowledgeable physician, compassionate, seems to genuinely care for his patients . . . or he's great at faking it . . . I'M ONLY KIDDING, Y'ALL! ;)  Everyone seems to love this guy. I was actually just at my bank, and the woman I was working with noticed my scar. She asked what Endo I see, and she told me she was about to recommend him to me if I didn't already go. She made the switch from another doctor within the practice because Dr. Harari actually listens, takes her concerns seriously, works to find a solution and didn't write her off as being "one of those patients".   Right now, he's monitoring my hormone production for the remaining half of my thyroid. Really hope that I won't need medication; however, if that's the case, I trust Dr. Harari and know that I will be treated with respect.   . . . Yeup, I STILL recommend Endocrinology Associates. :)

My last review = Dated. Time for an update!   I've been a patient of Dr. Amir Harari for almost four years now, and he's seriously the BEST physician I've encountered in my young life.   So much so that I wish it were possible to have this guy as my PCP!   I have highly recommended him to quite a number of friends and Yelpers now that have had horrible experiences with other Valley endocrinologists.  He really has a way of connecting with his patients, very patient with addressing any concerns and plans of action. You never feel like he's trying to bolt to the next patient or write off your symptoms.  Hey ladies, he might even heckle you about why your boyfriend hasn't proposed after FOREVER!  Plus not waiting 20 minutes beyond my original appointment time in three years? Yeah, the punctuality is more than appreciated!   Thankfully almost four years post thyroidectomy, my 1/2 thyroid has been behaving. Hopefully that continues. I will gladly come in once a year for a higher copay instead of my PCP.   While the front desk staff here leaves MUCH to be desired (gotta love an ugly, UN-Customer Service Oriented attitude from those ladies),  Crystal the MA is a doll.   I didn't see Susan this go around (ultrasound tech) but she's also amazing and makes getting your neck poked and prodded a little more tolerable!   If you need a stellar Endocrinologist for anything from managing your diabetes, thyroid disease or cancer, you're in good hands with Dr. Harari.   **Hey, PS, Doc ... I'm finally engaged. HAH! No more heckling? Or is this only the beginning with old married folks jokes?! ;)**

Dropped in this Jimmy John's last night after practice to catch up with Missy F. and Sarah R.   Conveniently located across the street from Mesa Community College - Well, at least when the roadwork on Southern isn't a mess and a half.  Nothing much to say, since we already know the subs are freaky fast and freaky delicious. There's a reason Jimmy John's is a college mainstay for many: Fast, affordable, delivery option, good cure for a "case of the munchies" ... Oops, did I really say that?!   My lettuce wrapped "unwich" #12 hold the mayo and cheese was no exception.   Friendly customer service. The guys working greeted us on our way in and out.   Also, it was super clean (at least what we could see) - even the bathrooms were damn near spotless for a "fast food" joint.   Surely, this location will come in handy during outdoor track season with all the meets nearby.

OK Rita's, what the heck is a Gelati?!  Why, it's Italian Ice layered with Frozen Custard. Perfect combo!   Dude and I dropped in last year on a scorching hot summer night.   The staff was friendly and let us sample the different flavors; did not feel rushed at all.   We both got the cookies and cream Ice with swirled custard. Pretty delicious, and cooled us off.   10% off your order if you follow this store on Twitter; oh yeah!   Also dropped in with my training partner shortly after a throwing practice.   The Orange Mango Italian Ice was very refreshing after 3+ hours of throwing hammers in 112+ weather.  Great customer service; delicious treats, I'll be back!

OK, so it's been almost a year, and felt this review was worth of a +1 star update!   My Coach and I were ousted (OK, more like had our training slots cut from the schedule) from the gym a few doors down. Ended up training closer to home in Chandler, which is much more convenient when you lift/workout 3-4 times each week.    Well, three of the coaches ended up opening up their own gym, so once again, I find myself in Maricopa one day a week.   Swung by Honeycutt Coffee last Saturday for a post workout iced toddy. Decided to spruce things up with a pump of Salted Caramel and a splash of cream.  I really enjoyed the taste of this. Strong toddy, and the Salted Caramel was decadent without being cloyingly sweet (like Starbucks beverages).   Another nice barista; enjoyed chatting with this gal. I barely had time to "Yelp Creep" and take photos of the lovely décor before my drink was up!   Honeycutt Coffee is just what Maricopa needed. It's a breath of fresh air compared to all the big coffee chains, and especially in what appears to be just another dingy strip mall.   Look forward to coming back many more weekends with my lifting crew!

Cartel, I adore thee.  Anytime I have a flight out of Terminal 4 (OK, almost EVERY flight), I will always hike to Cartel over those two other corporate coffee places.  It drives my travel companions batty, but once they taste the goodness that's brewed here, the complaining is quickly replaced with silence.   The baristas are always friendly, even at the ass crack of dawn seeing as I usually have 6:30 flights out to the Bay Area.   I always order an Americano, and so far, they make my favorite in Phoenix.   The cherry and almond scone is a nice treat.   Thank you Sky Harbor for exposing your travelers to many locally-owned businesses Phoenix has to offer, especially Cartel!

**Full disclaimer: This was my second experience with Bikram. My Dude gifted me a $35 Groupon for one month unlimited practice.**  I have never felt more genuinely welcomed at a Bikram studio (heck, ANY Yoga studio) than I did the day I walked into Bikram Yoga Rio Salado. Couldn't detect an ounce of fakery.  The first people I met here were Hannah, Charles and name twin Megan.   After my first class with Megan, I knew I was home.   And fell in love with the practice.   The studio is clean, inviting, no suspect olfactory assault (beyond what's expected) and just the right size - Not equipped to handle massive amounts of students, makes for an excellent teaching and learning environment.   Charles is a very positive, encouraging teacher and I highly recommend you take a class with him.   Really, though, everyone is phenomenal. And you will be remembered by name, wow!   I really enjoyed my summer here, and can say that combined with intensive physical therapy, Bikram certainly attributed to healing my meniscus and femur injury.   Some of the most affordable rates in the Valley for Bikram can be found here.  As for me, I'm almost to the point where I can pay for 6 months unlimited, and look forward to a consistent practice again.   Check it out for yourself.   Namaste, friend. :)

Andrew C. and I tried this Nando's location in April after reading a lot of good reviews from our friends on Yelp. Why not, right? We live in Chandler and it's not like it's out of our way.  Well, sad to be writing this review because we were pretty stoked to try it.  Short Version:    Not impressed!   Longer Version (Los Detalles):   We split the El Jefe Chicken Chimichanga. It was bland, overloaded with onions, and a few bites of chicken. Oh, about the chicken. It seemed like someone picked up a rotisserie chicken from Frys or Costco, shredded it up and threw it in the chimi. Laziness!    The salsa wasn't anything to write home about; like a bland jar of Pace. The "extra hot" habanero sauce didn't pack much heat, either.   If you enjoy quantity over quality, aka subpar Mexican food slathered in cheeses and sauces in ridiculously massive portions, then Nando's is your place.   The service was great, nice atmosphere and patio - That's not good enough of a reason for me to come back. OK, maaaybe for drinks, but there's just so many better place in the Valley to get a Mexi-fix!

I haven't been back to Zoo Lights in over 10 years, so Dude and I decided to go the day after Christmas.   Pro Tip: Buying your tickets online ahead of time ($16) will save you $2.   Bonus Pro Tip: They're digital! Just whip out your smartphone at the entry, and be on your merry way.   Bonus Pro Tip 2: Some days the tickets will be discounted even more than the online price ... Ziiiing! Check the Zoo Lights website for the deets.  Anywho, man, have things changed here over the decade! So many more light displays now.   I don't recall there being a timed music/lights display around the pond area. This was a nice touch with the being timed to some tracks from the Trans Siberian Orchestra!  Great activity for the little ones, if you can keep them awake late.   Sure it can get a little crowded on the weekends, but it still made for a nice date.   So bundle up, grab your lady or man, a cup of hot cocoa and enjoy the zillion light filled stroll.   Happy Holidays, Yelp Phoenix!

Unlike a good majority of women, I love me a trip to the auto parts store to pick up my filters and oil to do routine maintenance on my ride.   Let's just say it's fun to chill out with either my Pops (former auto mechanic) or Dude  and learn a thing or two instead of throwing myself into the Den of Shady Bastards (auto shops) who loooooooooove taking advantage of the fact you're female!   All the employees are extra helpful, so don't be shy: ask for help if you need it.   Love that I can drop off dirty oil here!   A little bit pricey, but the customer service here is superb . . . which is why I keep coming back.

Backyard Taco, what kind of magic or crack hath you bestowed upon your Carne Asada?   Whatever it is, it's enough to make me drive all the way from North Chandler to fulfill a craving.   Please ignore the symphony of gunshots as you roll up and a child choking incident on the patio like our first visit this summer.  Besides, I'm from Modesto, you don't scare me. ;)   Just get in line.  You're in for a real treat.   This place is very humble and totally adorable; limited indoor seating with the most excellent enclosed outdoor patio. Simple, clean metal tables and chairs.   Also, can we talk about how clean the place is? Even during peak service times, someone is always hustling to clear away debris on tables or keeping that salsa bar spill and splatter free.  The menu is very simple, which is perfect. Think Tacos, Burritos, Gorditas, Quesadillas, and the Papa Loca (crazy potato, have yet to indulge, next up).   So far, we've tried:  1) Tacos (Carne Asada, Birria, Pollo) - Never shorted on meat.   2) Freaking MASSIVE Burrito (Carne Asada, duh)   3) Quesadilla (I'm going to let you guess what meat!) - Surprisingly not a lot of cheese, which as someone with legit dairy sensitivities, I can get rocked with that!  When you walk in, you see the Carne Asada being cooked over mesquite chips, and ho lee WHACK that first bite is like hearing the Hallelujah Chorus - Tastebud Orgasm - Yeup, they exist!   Just the right amount of seasoning, never tough, and you can't miss those mesquite notes.  Burrito, Taco, Quesadilla, whatever you choose, you will NOT be disappointed.   And the afforementioned salsa bar is incredible.   Especially the Birria, Tametada and Jalapeño ones; sweet Lawd the Birria one brought tears to my eyes with how hot it was on one particular visit.   We've gotten out for under $13 with a Burrito, Quesadilla and a Drink.    Incredibly affordable. Take THAT overpriced and under-delicious sit down Mexican joints!  Don't forget to check in for a free order of Chips and Salsa; the perfect compliment to your feast.  If the story about this place is true, I would TOTALLY follow the owner into someone's backyard just to get a shred of his culinary delights.   Backyard Taco is the real deal. Make moves and plan your visit, mi gente!

Quik Trip is the Cadillac of convenience stores.   Immaculately clean, brightly lit, and always a fast and friendly experience.  I go out of my way to go to QT whenever possible, whether it's to gas up my ride or grab something to drink.   They have the cleanest restrooms you'll find in a convenience store. For that reason alone, I'll frequently change into my training clothes there on the way to practice knowing the floors won't be filthy (unlike the restrooms at the track, yuck).  The iced tea selection is ridiculous! Available in sweet and unsweet, I'm hooked to their unsweetened Pineapple Papaya and Mango flavors. And for .79 cents, you can't go wrong.   Pretty much any convenience store junk munchies can be found (chips, roller grill, etc.), but QT steps it up a notch and has a full-fledged bakery for donuts, pastries, ice cream mixers, smoothies and coffee.   Also, I have to say the assistant manager Joe C. kicks ass! The friendliest employee I've encountered at a QT, and that's saying a lot since they're all polite (in my experience at least).   I stopped by last night for some tea after training. Hadn't been in for quite a while as we had to train in Chandler for a while until MCC reopened.   This Dude remembered my name and what I was up to last I dropped in. Killer memory and great customer service!   QT will never do you wrong!

Sixth "meeting" for The Breakfast Club UYE, and my second time attending. Oh come on  . . . meeting?! "Our Meeting is Eating!" Stick it on a shirt already. Also my first time at Matt's.   We had to wait for our entire party to show up, fourteen total. Staff was very accommodating of us and ended putting several tables together for us.   On Jennifer O.'s suggestion, I tried the waffle with bacon. It didn't leave me with that carb hangover feeling you often get from waffles and pancakes, which was great seeing as I had to get to the gym shortly after. Real maple syrup; just the right amount for me. Watch out though, if you like a double dose, extra syrup is $1.50.   The bacon was what bacon should be: Thick and delicious! A little on the peppery side, but can you really complain? It's freakin' BACON!   For a place as well known and busy as Matt's, our dishes seemed to come out rather quickly. But as Preston S. and many others have mentioned . . . this tends to happen at the Breakfast Club. A lot. :)   No split checks, but we were all able to pay out our amount at the end with no issues.   No frills breakfast, but quality for sure. I will be back!   Shout out to Monica O. for orchestrating this whole thing!

Ak Chin is a phenomenal concert venue!   Dude and I had the pleasure of being dome rocked by Gary Clark Jr. and Foo Fighters back in September on the lawn.   I'm not going to gripe about horrible parking and traffic, because honestly, it was a piece of cake.   Heck, we arrived 20 minutes before the opening act took the stage and we still got in smoothly through an efficient security line and found our friends Shannon E. and Aaron quickly.   $15 beer aside, what better way to spend a summer evening than swilling beers and rocking out on a lawn? Pure Arizona, baby!   Pleasant concert going experience. I'd come back for another show, for sure!

Every time you write a review for a fast food joint, a puppy gets killed. :(  Bad Yelper. BAD!  It's no secret: I dig Chik Fil A.   It's a rare treat, but this lady can get rocked with an Original Chicken Sandwich and some of those famous Waffle Fries!   Haven't deviated much from what I initially tried during the year my family spent living in Woodstock, GA.  Was pretty pumped to see this location open up near work!  The service is always over the top friendly ("My pleasure!") and efficient, whether you dine-in, carry-out, or drive-thru it.   Their chicken seems less mystery-meat esque than most fast food joints.  *looks at ingredients list* *Dimethylpolysiloxane, "an anti foaming agent", what is that?!*  Haha ok, let's stop lying to ourselves, it likely still is.   But there's certainly a noticeable difference in quality.   Plus, the peanut oil everything gets fried in just plain tastes better.    CFA gets points for all their awesome contributions to local communities.   Don't forget to fill out the survey on your receipt to get a code for a free Original Chicken Sandwich on your next visit.   Bock, boooocccccckkkkkk!

Wow did this place live up to the Yelp hype!   If you're a fan of Rubios Fish Tacos ... I'm gonna have to ask you to RUN to Tortilla Fish.  There's a new sheriff in town, and they kick the chains asses with both hands tied behind their back!   Last week, I had an hour before I had to do my Phoenix-Southern AZ work commute and Dude had a day off work... So we decided it was time to finally try this place.  It wasn't too busy at 11. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by who I assume to be Francisco P. Super clean, even their restrooms.  I ordered the Full and Shrimp Tacos, Dude ordered two Shrimp Tacos. And we also split an order of beer battered fries. The free large drink Yelp check-in offer was a nice bonus!  The toppings and sauce bar was phenom. I tried the hot salsa on one, cilantro sauce on another, and added some shredded cabbage. We also got a side of ranch. Glad I stuck to the hot though; unlike other restaurants Tortilla Fish doesn't lie about spice levels.   Another friendly employee also told us they make all sauces in house daily. So good! Also, they don't cook anything til it's ordered.  I really enjoyed both of my tacos. The corn tortillas were incredibly fresh.   Yes, they fry the fish here but it was flaky, light and not bogged down with greasiness. The cheesy pepper in the Full Taco was sinfully delicious: Take a bite, and it melts everywhere.   Also, the ranch complimented the fries perfectly.   A lot of food for two people; if you drop in by yourself definitely stick to two tacos as the fry portion is huge.   Overall, great experience, amazing food with a side of stellar customer service.   We wish they were open later on the weekends.   Welcome to the neighborhood, Tortilla Fish. I anticipate returning many times and hope y'all stick around for a long time!

The wings are huge, the pizza is delicious, what more do you want or need to know about Barros?   Oh right, yes: This is a pizza joint. Don't venture off into the deep end beyond PIZZA and WINGS.  It's not the best pizza you will ever indulge in; however, there's a reason this place has been around for ev er: It's affordable and tasty.   Fire wings are true to their name. Barros Special is a fantastic combo, but we usually try to stick to 3-4 toppings.   And the customer service is great.   It should be known that I haven't dined in or even picked up at this location.   Just called in orders for that random Friday night Dude y yo are planning to binge watch Netflix and NOT lift a finger to cook! Always polite over the phone and never on infinite hold.  Bottom line, Barros is always a safe bet for take out pizza.

Little Cleo's = Incredible!   Review end.   . . .  HAH! Being a vague or "Tip Style" reviewer is criminal, so here we go.   Located on the Yard, this place is small and adorable. I loved being able to watch what was going on in the open kitchen.  If you can't handle a little bit of noise I wouldn't recommend sitting on the patio as it gets loud.   Dude took me here on a Friday night, and we didn't go seeking oysters (shame, next trip!), but we did share:   1) Bouillabaisse  2) Cajun Shrimp  3) Garlic Fries with Aioli   Anything seafood is high quality and you won't be disappointed.   The scallops in the Bouillabaisse were very tender and I had to resist keeping the whole plate for myself.   The broth was also perfectly savory, with not quite subtle yet not overpowering notes of fennel and saffron.  Pro Tip, save that grilled bread for the broth, you'll want to soak every last drop up!   Once again, the Cajun Shrimp delivered and it did not hold back on the spices! The traditional red potatoes and corn were not missing.   As for those Garlic Fries, I'm going to save my calories in the future as they weren't memorable. Pretty sure we didn't even finish them.   Don't forget to enjoy one of their many Royales (two thumbs up for Grapefruit and Elderflower) and check out the extensive Absinthe list - Yes, Absinthe!   Our server was a doll and did an excellent job without being overbearing or forgetting us - Especially since we were the only folks on the patio that evening.   Got a sneak peek of those Beignets drenched in Whiskey Caramel, and holy SMOKES was way too stuffed to indulge.    . . . But now there's an excuse to come back. ;)   Go already!

Nice, spacious Crossfit facility located in the lobby of The Springs Church.   Coach Dairus Barnes and Jarom Prows were awesome to give my Coach and I a new training home (after being ousted aka training times cut from our previous facility) back in July. We're stoked to represent them through sponsorship!   As I've said many, many times, I'm not a "Crossfitter". I simply use their bumper plates and bars to train for hammer throw.  However, the programming at CFC seems to be exceptional. There's a great community of people that train at this box that have welcomed Coach and I with open arms.  I truly enjoy working out with this group of people and look forward to Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday!   Coach Dairus is a riot, and I forgive him for being a CU Buff fan.   Frequent "Outside of the Box" WODs (Workout of the Day) on certain Saturdays: Think hiking, volleyball at the park, etc.   Don't forget team happy hour at Zipps from time to time!   Oh so Olympic Lifts are complicated and dangerous? Yes, but never fear! Coach Shawn Hanrahan (my coach!) regularly puts on weekend 3 hour, hands on Olympic Lifting Seminars.   He's been doing this for years, USAW Certified, trained by Meg Ritchie (look it up). Also a top Masters Olympic Lifter. Boom!  You won't find the monstrous egos you'll find at other CrossFit affiliates throughout the Valley. *ahem!*  In fact, some of the lowest tuition rates can be found here. I believe it's $75-$95 a month for unlimited classes.   The only complaint I have is no squat racks are here . . . yet!   If you want to improve your quality of life through functional fitness, climb off that couch and ditch your fast food runs! Come check out CrossFit Crew today and have a chat with Coach Dairus.

When I lived in Fort Collins, CO, Snooze was my favorite place for breakfast.   Especially on a morning with that hangover from hell that would always ensue after an evening of raging through the Rio or the Drunken Monkey in Old Town. Oy vey.   So, you can imagine how ecstatic I was to see them open in Phoenix!   April's Breakfast Club UYE was here. Monica O. always does a stellar job of hosting these! Brought Mama B. and Missy F. to experience the fun.   We had 12+ folks in our group, so we sat out on the patio. Perfect weather for it.   Knew what I was getting before we even arrived: A Pancake Flight! I got the Apple, Pineapple Upsidedown and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup. Hello, Diabetes!   Know that you can order anything half and half for the same price. So if you're stuck between one of Snooze's killer Eggs Benedict dishes or pancakes ... Live on the edge and indulge in both.   Get here early as this place gets PACKED, and fast.  Welcome to Phoenix, Snooze ... It's a joy to have a Taste of the (303) and (970) in the (480).

My Mom and my sisters get their nails done at Spectrum regularly. They're always rocking some serious nail art and I wanted in on the action!   A few weeks later, my family hooked me up with a birthday gift certificate.    Dude had a rare Sunday off work, so we ventured out to Ahwatukee for some couple's pampering after a weekend of Spring Training games.  Clean, modern nail spa as you will see from the pictures added to this business. Standard pedicure massage chairs with whirlpools, and a gorgeous granite nail bar.  Sterilization seemed above the standard in comparison to similar neighborhood salons. Processing the whirlpools with a solution in between clients, autoclaving every set of instruments for every client, Barbacide in plain sight.   Wide selection of your basic nail polish and scores of gel colors, crazy glitter included.   Tiffany and her husband (forgot his name) took great care of us! What's crazy is I recognized him from Miracle Nails from over 10 years ago in High School. Like Courtney C. said in her review; he's here now!  Dude got a Classic Pedicure with added callus remover ($25 pre-gratuity). Good thing too; his feet become weapons in between those 2-4 pedicures a year! Left the salon baby smooth.   Me? A Classic Pedicure with sugar scrub, and a Gel Manicure, both with chevron and glitter nail art (total, $61 pre-gratuity). Beautiful minty green color for Saint Patty's Day. Check out the pictures!  Again, Tiffany, Hanna and the entire staff made us feel right at home. Had some great conversations, too! We didn't feel like anyone was rushing to get the next client in the chair.   Will we come back? Yes, when our regular nail technician at a salon where I get my hair done is unable to get us in.   Let's just say we're loyal, longtime clients of hers and despite the wonderful experience we had here ... Totally felt like we were cheating on her!  Yet, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Spectrum to family, friends and Yelpers alike looking to beautify their hands and feet for a great price!

I visited Nails Studio 54 seeking some much needed post work, TGIF pampering.   And boy, did they deliver!   It wasn't incredibly busy upon arrival, so I was able to get into a pedicure chair immediately.   While the spa is quite minimalist in terms of decor, it's actually clean (I'm referring to the floors, which always seem to be filthy in these types of nail salons) and that's never a bad thing.   Again, Pinterest appeal vs. Your health and wellness - You pick!   You'll find 10 plush pedicure chairs. I'm not too sure about the manicure side, but the salon is also divided nicely into manicure and pedicure sections.   It's also nice that the desk is up front with a waterfall / divider wall where all the nail beautification is going down - You won't find that awkward everyone turning and looking at you when you arrive here as a tech asks you what services you'd like!   I went with the Spa Pedicure ($25) and the added Callous Remover ($5).   Lanny was my technician and she did an incredibly thorough job with both the grooming and polish job (went with Essie's 'Butler Please'). No sloppily trimmed or filed toenails, stray polish, or worse, cuts.   Can we also talk about that massage? Holy smokes. Lanny is a pro, and made it a point to tell me it's OK if I tell her that it hurts too much. Aw, heck no - Get in there; felt fabulous after being tortured by my physical therapist and lifting coach!   She was both a great conversationalist while still allowing me to get some reading in on the tablet! Total doll.   I also appreciated seeing Lanny pull out a fresh pair of tools from a steri-pack. Last month at the other nail establishment at Casa Paloma, I witnessed a technician sterilizing implements IN A GLASS CUP. Disgusting - Someone get the Arizona State Board of Cosmetology in there, stat!    The pedicure lasted an entire hour and not once did I feel rushed!   My only suggestion to management: Slow your roll with the upselling. I realize the next level up pedicure is $35 and includes that Callous Remover, but I saw no need for the additional service. It wasn't incredibly pushy, but I didn't find it appropriate after declining twice.   Also, with the 20% off check-in offer: I hate to be nit picky, but 20% off $30 is $24 - Not $25.   I'm cautiously optimistic about future visits, but I really enjoyed my experience and will certainly come back to see Lanny after work next month!

No one likes going to the Post Office during peak hours, but this location isn't bad!   I stop in here quite a bit because this is where the Business Reply Mail account and permit my work uses was registered. Got to keep that account balance up because no one likes a collections call or letter!   Kristy C has always been super helpful with our account or anything else I've ever needed.   Everyone else is also very friendly and prompt to serve whatever your mailing needs are.  Kind of hard to find if you don't know where you're going, but otherwise, very convenient location.

**FULL DISCLOSURE: This particular GNC is a regular sponsor of my weightlifting club's events (Olympia Weightlifting Club, Mesa, AZ), frequently providing prizes in forms of gift certificates and supplements. That connection has absolutely no influence on my review.**   You know what?  Normally, I loathe establishments like GNC.  Instant turn off by the sales sharks and the number one reason I'd rather just buy online.   Typical scene at any supplement store:   Me: *Walks into the store to replenish my Branch Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) and protein bars.*  Sales Person: Cue assault of a guy like THIS trying to sell me a bunch of crap I don't need and/or can't take: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmmZULPUEkQ   Me: "Dude, piss off!" *quickly runs out!*   Heck, I had a $25 Gift Certificate from a competition in won in February of 2015 I held onto for over a year to avoid the aforementioned nonsense.   Read that again: Held onto FREE MONEY for 16 months to avoid asshattery!   I ran out of my Xtend BCAAs and could not wait for a shipment from Amazon or Bodybuilding.com.  *Grumble, grumble, call the GNC, yes, they carry the Xtend brand, woohoo!*  I walked in here on a Saturday afternoon and was greeted by the owner Shannon and her daughter, Ashley and quickly learned that this is a family owned franchise.   Ashley quickly helped me located the Xtend products.   I was pretty bummed they didn't have any of the 90-day supply tubs in stock, or the Green Apple flavor, but was able to grab two 30-day supply tubs and try two new flavors: Grape and Blue Raspberry.   Presented my $25 Gift Certificate at the counter, where Shannon told Ashley, "Whoa, this girl is a BADASS - She won one of Istvan's competitions!"  The entire time I was here, there was no pressure to buy or hawking me as I looked around.   Have a feeling my online supplement ordering days are over.   Highly recommend you check out this GNC for any of your supplementation needs - It will mostly likely be a refreshing experience compared to any others you have had.  No BroScienceLife guys. Pinky swear!

What a far cry from the Francis & Sons on Beck and Chandler.   I understand quality and customer service varies from location to location, but this one was a mess and a half.   Normally I wash and detail my own ride, but wanted to spend some quality time with Dude this morning (homemade brunch, bloodies and Netflix, anyone?) so entrusted the crew here to revive my whip . . . Instead of driving to Beck and Chandler.   In hindsight, I should have, but a couple of  trustworthy Yelpmigos y Yelpmigas had glowing reviews, so took the chance.   Went with the $19.99 VIP wash with $5 off from the counter gal; extra $1 for an SUV (RAV4).   Not so bright things:  1) Understaffed to the max.   At one point, the salesman came back in and yelled at said counter gal to get more people out to help. In front of customers? Super classy, sir.   2)  They did NOT listen to instructions.   I specifically asked the salesman upon pulling up to NOT to use the polish on a certain part of my dash.   Guess what was left a greasy, disgusting mess?   3) Sloppy work. Finger prints all over my windows. Remnants of our hiking trip to the Superstitions still all over my bumper.   Failed to vacuum under the mats; heck, barely vacuumed them at all.   The cherry on top was the order information in wax pen left behind on my windows.   This place reminded me why I wash my own damn car.   Which is EXACTLY what we ended up doing when we got home. Ugh.   Can't believe I tipped them.   Lesson reaffirmed: If you want it done right, do it yourself . . . Or just go to Beck and Chandler those lazy 3-4 times every year we can't be bothered to do it ourselves.   Take your vehicle anywhere else but here for a car wash. Unless you enjoy a quality and customer service s-show, then enjoy!

I'm finding that some of the best breweries and taprooms in our Valley can be found hidden in nondescript business and industrial parks  and very easy to miss if you aren't paying attention.  Huss Brewing Company is not an exception to this rule - This place ROCKS!  When your fiancé works from home, he's bound to have some  serious cases of Cabin Fever - Like, every week haha - So Dude will look for any reason to escape.  So around 5PM on a random Friday, Andrew C. pulled me away from press releases and reports to surprise me with a new place (at least to us).    First off, yes - the taproom is small - Yet absolutely charming!  Nice muted grey color; decorative frames, mirrors, inspirational sayings and beer quotes dot the walls. A variety of seating options, from a decent sized bar, a community table and individual ones.  We sat at the bar for our first experience, and like anytime you visit a new brewery, you go for a flight or two!  If I recall, it was $8-$9 with more than decent sized pours in custom mason jars, all placed on a Lazy Susan of Sorts, with your corresponding beer choices spelled out in chalk.    I remember trying . . .   1. Koffee Kolsch 2. The Hustler Milk Stout  3. Peanut Butter Hustler Milk Stout  4. Magic in the Ivy Pale Ale 5. Scottsdale Blonde Ale Kolsch 6. That'll Do IPA  Shockingly, I wasn't too enthralled with the Magic in the Ivy or That'll Do, as IPAs and Pale Ales are normally my go-tos.   The Koffee Kolsch was incredibly smooth, no doubt in my mind that it was a coffee beer - Very drinkable, so, be cautious! ;)   The Scottsdale Blonde will be a refreshing, light choice as the weather continues to warm up.   The Hustler Milk Stout was a solid competitor with other Valley establishment's Milk Stouts - And begging to be used in a batch of Milk Stout cupcakes.   The real winner, though?! How about that Peanut Butter Hustler Milk Stout, y'all?!   Made with real Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (per the lovely gal tending bar that evening) with a creamy quality to it.   A Peanut Butter addict's DREAM ... Don't miss out! Heck, Dude enjoyed this one, which was amusing seeing as he hates peanut butter.   On another note, this is strictly a taproom, no kitchen.   But you're more than welcome to order delivery or bring some in. Perfect date night opportunity! We've been back several times with a pizza.   Friendly service, delicious brews in a chill and unpretentious atmosphere sums it up.   Now, what are you waiting for? Hustle on over to Huss, beer lovers!

Things Meg has a weakness for:   1) Delicious, local craft beer paired with 2) Great food, and 3) Dudes rocking some serious facial hair! *swoon*  Looks like Arizona Wilderness fits the bill,  outdoorsy, relaxed atmosphere and all.   And a short five minute drive from home, this can get real dangerous, real fast.   I met longtime homegirl extraordinaire Missy F. for some quality gal time the night before Thanksgiving.   Missy RAVED about the Pecan Pie Ale, so I was hoping it was still on tap.   After a 15ish minute wait for a table, our server Matt informed us that it had officially gone to the casks for aging.   Boo :( But he was kind enough to let us sample the Peloncillo Porter, fo' free.   According to him, this was comparable with the PPA, rich on the spices. I think there was even a note of date in it.   Enjoyed it so much I promptly ran out to my car to retrieve the empty growler I always have in the trunk for moments like this.   Also, it should be noted that AW's beers are constantly on the rotation, so try not getting too attached.  Of COURSE we couldn't be throwing down beers without some food to avoid a "White girl wasted" fiasco.   We ordered ...   1) Flying Belgian Pig   Oh my gosh, if you're going to order anything at AW please let it be this sinfully delicious concoction. Fries cooked in DUCK FAT, melt in your mouth pulled pork all smothered up in beer cheese.    2) Green Chile Pulled Pork Sandwich  I was pleasantly surprised with this one.   I travel to New Mexico rather frequently for work, and finding that green chile outside of the Land of Enchantment just isn't the same. This sandwich didn't disappoint. Same quality pork from the Flying Belgian Pig, and some of the spiciest green chile I've had in town.   AW may very well be in tough competition (well, at least in my book!) with two of my other favorite haunts down the street in Chandler.  Whether it's for a beer flight, a bite to eat, or just to take in the sights (read: all those BEARDS), check it out.   Know I'll most certainly be back for all three, especially that last one. ;)   Well done, AW!

Holy Smokes, a place that ISN'T a chain to get coffee in Ahwatukee? Color me shocked!   Met my Mom at WhereUBean a couple months back for what we like to call a Coffee Lunch: Not enough time to go get lunch on our breaks, but enough time to catch up for 30 minutes!   The vibe was really cozy, couches to lounge on and tables aplenty. It almost reminds me of an IKEA Showroom Living Room!  We noticed a few students studying. We sat out front that day as I needed to cool down from a blazing hot office.   The barista seemed a little quiet and standoffish, but he was really kind and helpful when my Mom needed help concocting a flavored latte.   WhereUBean gets the most points for brewing Intelligentsia Coffee, the smoothest you'll find next to Kona Coffee.   I enjoyed my dark roast and the biscotti we shared.  Well done, WhereUBean.  Now I just need to remember you're in the 'hood those work days I go back to Starbucks like that awful ex you can't stop seeing, but keep going back to out of ... Erm, convenience?!

The Perch Pub & Brewery is one of Downtown Chandler's best kept secrets, but probably won't be for long!   Walk through a seedy neighborhood, think you're lost, then the gate appears.   Allow yourself to be transported out of Chandler, if only for a brief hour or two.   The downstairs patio area is b-e-a-utiful. You can't miss 'em, but make sure you walk around and check out all the exotic avians. Luna is known to put on a show for guests. Silly girl.   You can either sit on the patio, in the indoor bar area, but the rooftop lounge is where it's at.   You'll find heat lamps to keep toasty during our "cooler" months, lots of comfy furniture and another bar.   Basically, it's the perfect atmosphere for a party. Think you can even reserve part of the deck for this purpose!   As mentioned in previous reviews, you absolutely must try their beers they brew on site!   The sampler is ginormous (see picture). Get it if you can't decide on a beer to order, which with their extensive list, you will. The struggle is REAL!   I've tried the Chocolate Porter, Rosemary IPA, Ginger MoFo (add a squeeze of lime to take it to another level, son!), Strawbery and Peach Beers and some kind of Butternut Squash Ale.   What to eat? Some of my favorites, so far . . .   1) Green Chile Pork Pizza   Tender pork, tasty but not spicy green chile, melt in your mouth crusts. One of the better pizzas I've had the pleasure of putting in my mouth in Chandler.   2) Wings   Jalapeño Marmalade and Barbeque IPA, the first being a favorite. All of their wings are smoked and fall off the bone delicious.   3) Carnitas Street Tacos   Again with the tender pork! Watch out if you don't like spicy; because the green chili will knock you out. No sides necessary, this dish comes with a black bean puree and a delicious pico de gallo, all nestled in a warm corn tortilla.   4) Tots Poutine   For the Love of Kraken, if you're going to get any kind of drunk munchies here, let it be this. Crispy tots smothered in stout gravy with a smattering of bacon and cheese curds.  Basically, plan on clogging up your arteries. You can get mini ones on happy hour, or go balls out and get the huge order with a group.  Never a bad experience with a server; always attentive and remember us by name.  The Perch is a nice change of pace from all the other establishments in the area. You'd be making a mistake not to check it out at least once, whether it's for a casual dinner or impressing a date with the unique ambience.   With all the new restaurants and bars I tried in 2014, you get the number one spot, Perch.   Happy New Year, Yelp Phoenix! :)

Wow. Zia Record Exchange really has their heart in Customer Service.  I was looking for a Blu-Ray of the final season of Dexter for Dude's Christmas gift.  The location in Chandler was completely out, and an employee there told me to hit up the Mill store.   I called before heading out to Tempe, and turns out they did indeed have a copy. The gal was nice enough to offer to put it on hold for me as it was the last one.   As a couple, we don't go over-the-top with junk (oh yeah, I went there) no one truly needs . . . Think gift limits, experiences over buying crap, etc. etc.  So that smile on his face was priceless.   Thanks for making it a great Christmas at our house, Zia!

Dear Phoenix Sky Harbor TSA,  What a day.   Unlike a lot of folks I encountered today, I'm a reasonable, calm lady.   I'm not prone to lashing out or threatening harm upon a poor Southwest Customer Service Agent because God forbid the weather couldn't get me to my destination on time.   Not being able to leave for Denver (I was scheduled to leave on SWA#1295, but cancelled at my client's request after several delays and him being unable to get on the road) because of the blizzard wasn't your fault.   But I wanted to personally thank you for chipping a large part of the front of my night guard used for TMJ today (11/17).   I rely on it to keep severe TMJ headaches and jaw pain at bay.   One time my TMJ got so bad, it damn near completely locked my jaw and had to be prescribed heavy duty muscle relaxants just so 1) It could open and 2) So my dentist could see the damage.  This was a $300 dental appliance I've had for two years and had to pay 100% out of pocket because my insurance doesn't cover it.  In the future: When inspecting dental appliances in a passenger's bag, please handle with care. Night guards, retainers, etc. are NOT cheap to replace and aren't always covered by insurance.   Seriously, break our make-up compacts all day. Just not the night guards!  Let's hope my dentist can help me with this.   Signed,   Nighttime Jaw Clencher Lady who's about to be in a LOT of pain. :'(

Sometimes, you just want a donut.  When that craving strikes, head on over to this BoSa Donuts location!   I know you're thinking, "Been to one BoSa, been to them all!" but not so fast. This one is a little different in a few ways:  1) Cleaner and more modern compared to other locations  2) No drive-thru; however, parking is plentiful  3) This location does NOT charge .55 cents or whatever it is to use your credit card. Woohoo! Much appreciated as I rarely have cash, and I'm not about to bring home a dozen donuts.   My favorite is definitely the Chocolate Old Fashion Donut. Melt in your mouth chocolatey goodness, especially amazing if you come in before 8AM!   Also, if you really want to blow some calories, try the Buttermilk Donut. Don't say you weren't warned . . . so good!   Their Thai Iced Tea here is also delicious, and the boba pieces are ginormous.   The employees have always been cheerful and patient with customers with large orders.   Hit up BoSa Donuts when your sweet tooth is screaming at you - Unlike the big donut chains, it's worth wasting your calories!

Some things you need to know about Angry Crab Shack:   1) You're going to get messy. Don't show up in your finest threads, mmkay?  There are sinks in the dining room for you to clean up. And let me assure you, you WILL need and use them.  2) It will be busy, but I promise it's worth the wait. Simple solution ... Don't show up super hungry, eat a light snack before.  Or you can do what my MIL/FIL/SIL did:  Get impatient, then go to a subpar pizza joint in lieu of an epic wait. Whomp x 100!  3) It's absofrigginlutely delicious!  Dude and I tried ACS out on one of his rare Sundays off work. Thirty minute wait, which was no biggie.   Our server was an absolute doll, explaining to us how seafood boils go, how everything is priced at market prices, etc.   We ordered:   1) Hush Puppies. So damn good, and I'm not a big fan of them! The sauce they give you (some kind of jalapeño ranch?) is the perfect compliment.   2) 1 lb of Shrimp in level three Trifecta sauce (I believe this is lemon, Cajun and garlic combined).  3) 1lb of Snow Crab in the same sauce.    Everything was super fresh, and deliciously messy.   We LOVE super spicy foods, and I'm glad our server talked us into getting the level three Trifecta instead of four. That stuff was perfectly blazing!    Ended up getting a side of the level four for dipping, maybe one day I'll get ballsy enough to actually order something with it.  Overall, a great experience, solid customer service and some of the freshest seafood you'll find away from the coast.   Can't wait to come back again and wash all that delicious food down with a few Abita beers!

Enjoyed a lovely breakfast at the Henry in September with the Breakfast Club UYE.   Our party was 15 strong.   We originally started out on the patio, but eventually moved inside due to the heat.   Thank you Seth and Company for taking such great care of us; they absolutely shouldn't have gone this far for us.   I love the design of this place; from the patio to the interior. Even the bathrooms were carefully thought out!   Things Dude y yo ordered:  1) Pecan Cinnamon Roll   . . . Ok, this was mostly to prevent a passed out Meg on the floor. Needed to get my blood sugar back up from a workout. But thanks Dude, Amy and Jon H. for sharing with me!  2) Egg White Turkey Omelette   Solid post workout option. REAL roasted turkey, much appreciated. Organic egg whites. Healthy amount of avocado, tomatoes and swiss cheese.   It came with breakfast potatoes and we ordered a side of bacon. SO much food.   3) Bagel and Lox  Just your typical everything bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, capers and onions.   This thing was PACKED!   A little pricey for breakfast, but worth every penny.  Excited to go back and try dinner.   Thanks Monica O. for hosting another awesome UYE, and thanks again to Seth and the Henry for tolerating our shenanigans!

To give you an idea of how much I love this place:  Dude and I live less than two miles from Rita's South Tempe, and we go out of our way to drive to Joe's.   It's just that good! Cute place, too. Always buzzing with ASU students in search of a late night sugar fix.  We have done Joe's runs several times now and haven't been disappointed. Two of the times were very close to closing time, and the staff was still very friendly.   You can sample just about anything you want.  So far my favorite has been the Peanut Butter Cup ice. Yeup, you read that right! Like a frozen Reese's cup.   Dude was a huge fan of the Snozberry and Monster Mash flavors.  The Joe-Latti was just meh. The soft serve tasted  super artificial, kind of like Cool Whip. Rita's Gelati is the one up they have on Joe's.   If you're looking for flavor explanations, there's a laminated sheet at the counter explaining what is what.   Kind of wish they had all the fresh ices on display (and not behind a wall), but it's really no issue.   Check out Joe's if you're looking to cool off - It's heating up fast this year, Phoenix!

Pizza On 87 is just what my neighborhood needed.  A local business focused on keeping their customers delighted, and serving delicious pizza.    I've noticed the owner chat with every customer, which is nice. You can tell he's invested in making this place the best it can be.   I've watched this place transform the past couple of months, and it's been cool to see it go from just another building on Arizona Avenue to it's own unique feel.  Think licenses plates, pallets turned into seating, unique memorabilia.   They even have this table that's a chalkboard for all you folks with little ones to keep entertained when dining out.   Never actually ate here; always take out. But I know I'll be coming back once the hot weather dies down to enjoy dinner on one of the high tops on the patio.   Draft beer? I'm in!   Pizza on 87 cuts no corners. It's clear that the ingredients are incredibly fresh, and you can assume this is not frozen dough or industrially-canned sauces. The crust practically melts in your mouth.   They're also affordable. One of the great specials is $10.87 for a Large Pepperoni Pizza and some Garlic Knots.   Can we talk about those garlic knots?! So buttery and delicious, real chopped garlic and not garlic salt.   I only get them if I know we're having friends over for fear of committing carbicide!  Whether it's Pizza/Wine/Yoga Pants/Netflix night, or you're just seeking delicious pizza, check out this place out.   I hope Pizza on 87 sticks around for a long time.

Clueless Lady: "Über? It's soooooooo expensive!"   Me: "Yeah? Well what's $30 compared to a $10,000+ DUI and becoming someone's prison wife in Arpaio's tents?"   Über, you're the best.   Whether I need a lift to the airport, a ride to bar or a ride to retrieve my or someone else's car, I can always depend on you to get me where I'm going safely and on-time.   Can you track where your cab is on a handy-dandy app? Nooope!   Now seriously, kids, if you haven't already: Download the app! That $25 credit for your first ride will get you started.   And remember: Your $30 (or whatever) is nothing compared to being tossed around like Girl Scout Cookies in Tent City.

If Cracker Barrel and Paradise Bakery had a baby, Kneaders would be the result.  Except the food tastes much better! Oh, and a drive-thru.   I met my Mom here just after noon today and it was poppin'! When you first walk in, you will see a variety of home goods (think clocks, aprons, home decor, salt and pepper shakers) much like CB.   And don't even get me started about all the beautiful goodies in that pastry case; had to stop ourselves from buying Key Lime Tarts and Peanut Butter Fudge.   We ordered at the counter. Decided to split a giant Turkey Bacon Avocado sandwich on Focaccia, and we each got a cup of the Three Cheese Cauliflower Soup (soup of the day).   Helped ourselves to some Pomegranate Iced Teas and grabbed a seat on the patio.   Just be careful out there on a windy day, the tables are kind of shaky and I managed to pour tea on my dress. Thankfully it dried before going back to work!   I wasn't a huge fan of the soup. Kind of reminded me of Broccoli Cheddar and a little heavy. Needs more cauliflower! My Mom really enjoyed it, though.   The sandwich was what stood out. Love focaccia bread, and these guys didn't disappoint. You could tell the bread was made recently.  Very tender roasted turkey, didn't skimp on the bacon, creamy avocado alongside provolone, crisp lettuce, onion and tomatoes and Kneaders sauce.   No idea what was in the sauce, but it was much better tasting than typical mayonnaise.   To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this Idaho/Utah/Arizona chain and was quite impressed. I'm super stuffed right now, and will be back for a sandwich and some of those pastries.

Found out through Shannon E. The Fractured Prune's Grand Opening was today, and wasted no time hustling over on my break!   Apparently, some other guy didn't either: "I drove all the way out here from Apache Junction for a dozen!"   When I walked in I was immediately greeted by Marilyn. She talked me through their custom donut process: Selecting a custom glaze and toppings before handing off your card to a doughnut designer.  Think combinations like Dreamsicle, Chocolate Covered Cherry, Maple Bacon.   Decided on two Mint Chocolate Chip doughnuts: One for me to scarf down at work, one for Andrew C for later.   Because he might murder me later for going alone.   And I'm not a self-centered, lameface lady friend. Doing "Nice things" goes both ways, ladies.   These donuts aren't sitting around in a case, either. Custom means made when you order.   Got back to work and took a bite. Still piping hot, minty, chocolatey, practically melting in my mouth as I ate it.   This is really a four star review masquerading as a five star: I love the custom concept; however, I'm more of a "classic doughnut" gal: Think Old Fashioned Kruller with some chocolate on it.   The customer service is what bumped the rating up to five stars!   Now go, take a doughnut break. Meanwhile, I'll resist inhaling Dude's while waiting for him to pick it up!

Ever since the Elite Event at Orange Theory, I've been looking for any excuse to come back and nosh at Flower Child.   A long three months later, the opportunity presented itself on my way back from some meetings.  Yeah, it's that delicious. Locally sourced food made with love.   You order at the counter, and are given a number.   Take a seat anywhere, the staff will find you and your number even if you go on the patio!   Since I had been CRAVING the Mediterranean Salad with a healthy portion of Salmon, I didn't try something new.     It's the perfect blend of greens, tomatoes, onions, cucumber, garbanzo beans and lightly dressed with feta and an oregano vinaigrette.   This is what I love about Flower Child: Simple ingredients are the star on their own, without being drowned out in cheeses or sauces.   Also, the seasonal Apple Cider Lemonade was phenomenal. Was not expecting that combination to work!   Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.

I love the emporium of beauty products that is Ulta, but the customer service is h-o-r-r-e-n-d-o-u-s! And I don't think that's exclusive to this location, either. How hard is it to at least pretend you enjoy your job?   This last year, the only person I can recall ever being greeted by / assisted by in this store was Heidi. She helped me find a Bare Escentuals eye brightener I was looking for. She even went as far to show me how to apply it (without me asking), and . . . *gasp* appeared ENTHUSED about her job!   I don't think I would waste my time coming into this store if they didn't carry Bare Minerals products. Plus, it's on my drive home from work, so it's a matter of convenience really.

Apparently, Honeycutt Coffee moved?! At least according to their former Yelp page it did. Nope, folks, still in the same place.  Oh well, I'll go ahead and contribute another review, and up my rating to five stars.   Why? Honeycutt Coffee is becoming a Saturday mainstay for me.   Finish my training at Crossfit 347, hop on over to HC get myself an Iced Toddy to cool down on the drive back into town.   As you'll see in the pictures, the atmosphere is warm and inviting in an otherwise boring Maricopa Strip Mall.   There's plenty of cozy furniture to read a book or catch up with a friend, and large / small tables are available for whatever you need to get done.   You can tell the owner is invested in the community, which is awesome. On my most recent visit (today), there was lots of Maricopa High School Rams Athletic attire adorning the walls.   So far, I've only tried an Iced Tea, Iced Toddy with a pump of Salted Caramel. The Toddy is strong and will wake up the sleepiest of folks.   Today, I tried the Teddy Bear Latte at the barista's suggestion.  I'm not a huge fan of milk-based, syrupy sweet beverages (a la Starbucks, gross) but this was delicious. The TBL has both Salted Caramel and Spiced Brown Sugar in it.   I'll definitely be ordering this beverage again. The barista today was kind enough to remake my drink (accidentally ordered it hot) even though the mistake was mine. Now that's great customer service!   Oh, speaking of customer service, almost forgot ...   Make sure you sign up for a punch card. Think it's buy 10, you get the 11th free. And unlike traditional paper punch cards, this one's like a gift card: You can preload it! Also,  I think if you load a certain amount, HC adds extra money on to it.   When I started mine, Eric the owner was nice enough to credit my last three weekend's Toddys to my card. Thanks, Eric! :)  Remember, this place closes early afternoon, so check the hours before you go.   Thanks for brightening up my weekends, Honeycutt Coffee team!

Fun fact about the Arizona Distlling Co and Barilla Pasta:   Did you know the wheat used to make Desert Durum Wheat Whiskey is purchased by the Barilla Pasta Company to make *their* supposed imported product?   Apparently, the wheat is just that good!   So next time you're in Fry's picking up that box of Barilla Penne Rigate or Capellini just remember: Some of this comes from Arizona . . . Not Mother Italia like they want you to believe.   Anyway, as part of Dude's birthday gift last year, I hooked him up with the "Tour for Two" Groupon to the Arizona Distilling Co, and had an absolute blast.   Hint, hint, gents of Yelp: This makes for a wonderful date. Impress your wife, lady friend or someone totally new with this, then go grab a bite.   The place isn't much; in fact, it's slightly hidden.   If you're not one of our State's finest Drunk Driving Douchebags, I highly recommend having your Rideshare Provider of Choice drop you off at Culinary Dropout, then walking back down the street to:   1) Avoid Tent City, and  2) Save a little dough on your ride.   Upon walking up to the building, the owner Jason took the time to chat with us and point us in the right direction where Garrett was wrapping up the last tour.   Garrett was our + another couple visiting from Denver's Cruise Director, and man this guy was hilarious!   "This is our distillery. Now get your $#!+ and get out!"   Really, a great way to put it. The tour was only 20-30 minutes, but loaded with wonderful information about the love, time and process that goes into making their craft -  And you can tell this is their passion.   More Fun Facts: The Angel's Share (the amount of whiskey, etc. that is lost to evaporation when the liquid is being aged in porous oak barrels) in Arizona is 12%-15% where as places such as Georgia and Kentucky it's around 1%-3%.   After getting edumucated, it was time to hit the bar for the sampling. And despite what Groupon said, these pours were more than half an ounce and your girl was schhhhhwassssted!  The Copper City Bourbon was smooth, flavorful and easy to drink.   The Vodka ripped up my throat, haha!   I'm still on a mission to obtain a bottle of the Desert Dry Gin.   Lemme tell ya, that was a bouquet of flavors going Mike Tyson on your taste buds. Cardamom, Apple, Lavender, Cumin, Coriander, Cinnamon and Lime Zest all come together in perfect harmony.   It's easy to see why this Spirit has fared so well in big name Spirit Competitions (2014- Silver Medal, San Francisco World Spirits Competition, 2015 - Double Gold Medal, San Francisco World Spirits Competition).   Don't forget to smell it before you drink it.   We also had the opportunity to try two of Arizona Distilling Co's exclusive cocktails: Apple Pie Moonshine and Bees Knees.  Most of my experiences with moonshine up until this point happened living in the South, and this was nothing like that. This drink was like drinking an Apple Pie and very hard to detect the Moonshine.   The Bees Knees was made with local honey, lemonade and that delicious Desert Dry Gin. Sweet, tart, and more Mike Tyson knock your tastebuds out action. My favorite sample of the night!   Would do this again in a heartbeat.  Support and Drink Local, folks!

The amazing part about Terminal 4 in Sky Harbor is you get a great sample of the local PHX flavor instead of your everyday McDonald's, Jamba Juice, etc. commonplace in US airports.   I'm a card carrying, verified Los Taquitos addict, and know they've been here for a while. Decided to grab a bite on my way out to Albuquerque this afternoon to see how it compared to their Ahwatukee and Phoenix locations.   If you're going to take anything way from my review, let it be this: This location is absolutely NOTHING like the flagship (if you don't count the food truck) locations.  Sure, the menu looks almost identical: Breakfast Burritos and Tortas, the infamous Street Tacos and Quesadillas.   The food even looks the same.   Yes, I realize this is airport food, but the only thing from a quality control standpoint that tastes the same are the roja y verde salsas.   I went with the 3 Street Tacos Combo and a Large Water Bottle for a total of $12.13.   The tortillas were sad and cold.   The beans were playdoh-esque, cold and the rice had way way WAY too much seasoning.   All of the meats were lukewarm. The Pollo was dry and crumbly, the Carne Asada lacked that vibrant spice we all know LT by, and the Carnitas were also missing that unique spice.   I will say though, the Carnitas was the most moist of the three.   Sad, wilted cilantro and onions were scattered on haphazardly.   What a disappointment. This is one of my favorite taco places in town, and it's a shame they're misrepresenting their product here.   This would have been a one star review if we're going off food quality only; however, the team was really hustling, the gal was taking orders was cheery, and the manager took time to chat with me.   Come on, Los Taquitos family - Take a look at quality control, I know y'all are worlds better than this.

"Damn, this Opa Life Pita is delicious, but it is filling!"   *throws out the window at unsuspecting motorcyclist*   . . . If you get this reference, you win the Internets.   I was pretty bummed when My Big Fat Greek Express closed, so it's nice to see a new player in this space.   First, it must be said that Opa Life did a beautiful job transforming the place from cramped, dingy and tired to beautiful, clean and spacious. Amazing what a little TLC can do.   There's also patio seating now, which will be nice when the hot weather dies down a bit.  Dude and I swung by tonight for a quick dinner before a movie at Arizona Mills.   It's very similar to the previous establishment; counter service with self serve drinks.  The lady working the front of the house was quick to greet us, ask us if we've been in before, and made suggestions.    Both of us got the "Opa Time!" special ($9.95, $2 increase from MBFGRE): A Pita of your choice and Greek Salad or Fries ($1 extra for Greek Style). Dude got the Philly Style Gyro; myself, the Classic Gyro, both with a Greek Salad.   As mentioned earlier, these babies are STUFFED. As in, good luck getting your hands around it.  If this wasn't my first meal of the day, I probably would have shared!   The gyro meat was tender and well seasoned, and the Tzatziki sauce wasn't lacking in flavor. I was able to steal a bite of the Philly Style Gyro, and it was a tasty change bursting to full with all those mushrooms, peppers and cheese.   The dressing on the Greek salad was oil based, a nice change from the creamy, Ranch-y mess often used.   The only thing that was gross was the wax paper under the food was kind of getting all soggy. I guess it's better than eating off one of those bare trays . . . But, it'd be nice if they invested in some actual plates.   Don't miss daily Happy Hour from 3PM-7PM: $3 you call it draft beers . . . San Tan Products available, what?! It also includes $5 glasses of wine and $2 off any appetizer.   Glad to have a no frills Greek place back in the neighborhood - We'll be back for Happy Hour or before another movie date!

Oh testosterone-loaded, sexy and beastly abs of Rich Froning . . .  THIS WAS SO MUCH FUN! Most fun I've had on a Sunday in ages!  I have always wanted to try a workout at Orange Theory. So was super pumped to see Lindsey posting an event on a Sunday afternoon.   Now, Sunday is usually my rest day. I log 20-35 hours a week training for hammer throw (Track & Field) in addition to 40+ hour work weeks. So a day with Netflix and a glass of wine and a cheat meal becomes more than a necessity.  Against my Coach's advice (and some teasing for going to do a "Hamster Workout"), I gave rest day a giant middle finger. How often do I get to kick it with awesome Yelpers, right?!    . . . Watch me regret this mañana.   Showed up just before the 2:15 sesh. Signed my life away on a waiver in case I had a coronary and died, then got strapped up to a HRM. Also, the Yelp Sweat and Tears wrist sweat bands are cute . . . Can't wait to wear it over my hammer glove during track season. Yelp REPRESENT!   So there were no surprises here. Just a mix of resistance exercises in blocks with some rowing thrown in and some running on the treadmill. The DREADMILLS were just as torturous as anticipated (I run outside, damnit, it's natural!). The concept was: Find your Base Pace, a Push Pace, and an All Out effort for 40-90 seconds (could be wrong, brains were lacking oxygen).   OTF Arcadia e-mailed us the workout results super fast. It was nice to see I burned over 700 calories and kept my HR in the Orange Zone for over half the workout!   Was it tough? You bet! I'm in great shape, and I am foam-rolling / therabanding the right foot and ankle / icing my stupid arthritic knee / hating life as this review is being typed. WHOMP!    Would I sign up for a place like this? No way. It is a killer workout, no doubt, but machine based workouts aren't my jam, and that's OK.   Big thank you and a zillion high fives to trainer Eric and fellow Yelpers for tolerating Lisa E. and I's jackassery: "A-Skipping" it up on treadmills, dancing on treadmills, and general rowdiness - Hey now! It's important to encourage your workout pals to hustle to build that muscle. And it makes the workout suck less.   The food at Flower Child was delicious. Indulgently healthy, and the perfect post-workout recovery meal! Can't wait to bring friends back. It was nice to sit, chat, and catch up with Yelp Pals.   Tried the Mediterranean Salad with Salmon as the protein. Everything was so fresh, allowing for the flavors of the food to be the star without a whole lot extra junk added. The salad was lightly dressed in an Oregano Vinaigrette.   The Pomegranate Pear Lemonade was refreshing; could have taken a gallon of that stuff home.   We got to try the Kombucha and Kale Juices . . . Pst . . . Kombucha is on TAP here!   Also got to sample a few pastries, some avocado hummus with pita (about to try and recreate this!).  One of the employees hooked us up with some samples of their gluten-free mac and cheese. Had to resist not eating the whole plate. It was that good!   Also, the parting gift of the mini cakes were much appreciated!   All in all, a wonderful Sunday. It was a surprise to see an activity-centric event posted, and look forward to hopefully seeing more in the future (Hot Yoga?! Maybe a CrossFit fundamentals class?! That'd be dope!).   Well done, Lindsey, OTF Arcadia and Flower Child for having us. Y'all did a stellar job hosting this event!

If you were a member at CrossFit Maricopa and wonder what happened to Coaches Natalie Guarnery, Jennifer Faust, Mike Vigil or Shawn Hanrahan- Head on over to CrossFit 347! Nathan Maxcy of CrossFit Battlefit is also here.   What else is there for me to say, really? I LOVE this place and the community of athletes and coaches. I make the drive from Chandler to Maricopa three days a week from June - December  for this group. Oh, and my hammer coach works here. Hah!   Beautiful, spacious facility. Two platforms, an infinity rig, plenty of men's and women's bars, rows on rows of bumper plates. Don't forget the kettlebells! Just check out the pictures I'll soon be uploading for this business.  You won't find the *monstrous egos* that are so prevalent at other boxes throughout the Valley.  What you will find is a supportive, encouraging environment with coaches that will help you surpass what you thought were your limitations. Oh, and getting in killer shape is a wonderful side effect.   Some things to note when choosing this CrossFit box over another in Maricopa:  1) The owners don't do this for the money. This isn't their job; they have day jobs! They aren't dependent on your membership fees, because changing lives in the community is their PASSION.   A lot of folks will say that, but they truly don't. Money that comes in from your membership, retail sales on protein products or apparel goes directly back into CrossFit 347. No one has taken a single cent. Boom, roasted!  This way, you can be assured the team is making the right decisions for your health and fitness journey without greed being a motivating factor.   2) They operate the first and only USAW Certified competitive weightlifting club in Maricopa, the Rising Phoenix Barbell Club.   In addition to the CrossFit schedule, Olympic Weightlifting classes are offered, led by experienced and accomplished strength coaches (Shawn Hanrahan and Greg Faust).  You will learn a focused  technique driven approach to these lifts. Rising Phoenix competes against other clubs in the valley. Freakin' sweet, no?!    3) Also, this is the only CrossFit box in Maricopa that offers a first responder discount for Fire, Police, EMS, Military, and Border Patrol.   If you want to take a holistic approach to functional fitness with quality coaching, check out CrossFit 347.   This is "As good as CrossFit gets!" in Maricopa.  www.crossfit347.co (yes, the .co is correct!) for class times and more information.

Total Wine & More is always an ALCO-Holiday  no matter which location you go to!  I can spend hours in here just browsing the bottles of wine, spirits, beers . . . Hitting up the vendors for samples . . . Saddling up to the growler bar to sample the latest local offerings before committing to a full 64 ounces . . . *happy sighs!*   Taking forever an a day to assemble a Create Your Own Six Pack is something Andrew C. and I have bonded over for much of our relationship.  Pretty much all TW's are the same . . .   *record scratching*  Umm, excuse me?!  I think not . . .   What makes it so special?   I mean, we live within 3 miles of the Emerald Center one - So why go out of our way to go to Tempe Marketplace?   1) Unlike other locations, this one has a FREAKING BOTTLE CHILLER.   You know those times you make a 6 pack and want to enjoy it immediately, but can't because they weren't refrigerated? Last minute bottle of white wine you need to chill for that dinner party?   First world ishas solved, people. Pop 'em in the chiller for 7 minutes and they're "been in the fridge for 24 hours ice cold"!   2) Abraham works here!   This guy is the Albus Dumbledore of Beer. We spent countless hours chatting it up with Abraham over the years, be it baseball or beer, and were heartbroken he disappeared.   The guy never let us down for a beer recommendation. We are so glad to have found him again.  Seek Abraham if you're looking to shake up the beer routine. TW is lucky to have such a BOSS employee!   Downsides:  1) ASU students and all their asshattery.  2) Tempe Marketplace Parking Clusterfug.   Here's hoping there won't be a line at the epic bottle cooler on Friday nights now that I've revealed the secret.

Pleasant staff, affordable services (in the world of dry cleaning at least) with a focus on being environmentally friendly.  I had five pairs of pants and five skirts for work that needed some attention.  Since my former dry cleaner closed up shop, I needed a recommendation for a new one. Valerie M. strongly recommended Green Clean Dry Cleaning, as she's been a customer for over a decade!  The gent working on Saturday hooked me up with a 20% percent off coupon since it was my first time in. Suhweet!    My threads were ready by 5PM on Monday, looking fresher than ever.   I know I'll be back for my regular dry cleaning needs as well as a boatload of "former big girl" clothes that need to be consigned.  Thanks, GCDC team and Valerie!

A work dress of mine was damaged while at Green Clean.   I called the manager/owner, Luis, nervous and expecting a "Not responsible for damaged garments!" response I know is standard  from other dry cleaning companies.   Not even close!   "Bring it in, Meagan, and we'll take a look!"   Brought it in, and not only did he take a look, but had the seamstress repair the split hem at no cost to me, no questions asked.  Now THAT is just one way a business can create and retain loyal customers.   Favorite shirt dress damage aside, customer for life.   Thanks for continuing to take great care of my clothes at an affordable price, Green Clean crew!

Many years ago, Dude lived in the apartments across the street from Espo's.   I guess "technically" I did too, but we won't get into that.  ;)   Sure, we heard all of the epic stories about their incredible machaca and legendary green chile options and Christmas tamales, but despite the SUPER close distance, we never made it in.   Sad trombone when they closed. :(  ... Until Espo's reopened, woohoo! Let's remedy this with an afternoon off work!  It's a humble, small restaurant. All signs pointing to, "Prepare to be domerocked!"   Don't expect anything fancy or sit down; if you're seeking that, do us a favor and drag your hoity toity self to the Biltmore.   Now that that's out of the way ... What to expect?   Freaking AMAZING food.   We shared the El Jefe Burrito. Steak, cheese, jalapeños, I think there was Pico de Gallo and red salsa.   Super delicious and filling! The steak was tender and the flavors worked well together.   Although after reading Jay M.'s review (and looking at pictures) I immediately regretted not getting it Chimichanga and Enchilada style.   The guacamole is also fresh and out of this world!   A word of warning though, do not order it if you struggle with spice.   Thanks to cooking for a Latino man for 5+ years, I went from "Taco Bell Mild Sauce is painful!" to "WTF is this?! Have her bring more chilies, hon!" (While eating Thai Hot Pad Thai at the supposed highest level of spice!) Let's just say my eyes were running rivers after each chip. Delicious!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.   I'm soooooooooo sorry I overlooked you, Espo's - Don't ever leave Chandler again!

This place is a-freaking-dorable.  The owner, Grace, clearly spent a lot of time on branding her business.   Snophie the Fox? Awwww! Who did y'all hire for art?  *End Marketing Geek Out*  Anyway, Glacier Snow Sweets & Treats opened up in our neighborhood a few months ago.   After seeing Joycie-Joyce Dubs and John L. checking in and raving about it, Dude and I finally dropped in on a rainy July evening.   We were "Snow Virgins", and Janina and Grace were very helpful in introducing us to the wonderful world of it!   Ended up splitting the Green Tea Icicle Snow ($6.95), which had Red Beans, Mochi, Popping Pearls and Condensed Milk. Janina also informed us we could get a Thai Tea for $1 - Done and done, but add the Boba ($0.40).   First of all, WOW! This treat can easily serve 4 people, but we totally demolished it. The snow was light, refreshing while still having a creamy quality to it. I wasn't sold on the Red Beans, but will definitely give it another go.  The Thai Tea didn't disappoint, and the Boba were deliciously chewy.   We also came back an additional time and split a Red Velvet snow.   Shake up your dessert routine and give Glacier Snow a try!

With Rainbow Donuts moving into the space once occupied by Golden Donuts, I finally tried the legendary Maple Bacon Donut.  Sweet Baby Heysoos. You must try this piece of "Diabetes Delight" - NOW!   The actual donut had a soft and fluffy texture (not much to chew here!), thin layer of maple frosting and a substantial amount of bacon. Like, thick cut, still fresh delicious bacon . . . None of that bacon bits nonsense.   Good thing they require a $3 minimum for Card purchases or else I'd be a frequent flier and needing a new pair of jeans.    The store is much cleaner than the predecessor, and the difference in customer service is night and day.   The gent at the counter was more than friendly and was patient with us as we scoped out the donuts.   I'll be back soon for another 400 calorie bomb, whether it's the donut I had today, a cronut or that Peanut Butter Creme one.   *eyes roll into the back of my head!*

Johnny's is Lobby's 2.0, guys.   And thank goodness it's back - That was a long four months of fry sauce withdrawals, lemme tell you!  Same cook. Same delicious menu. Same delicious fry sauce. Same squeaky clean burger joint.  Ran by a former partner of Lobby's that brought life to the place we all know, love and crave!  After seeing a check-in from Jared R., Dude and I made a late night burger run high on our weekend to-do list.  Carlos was quick to greet us and make conversation of how this place rose from the ashes of the Lobby's closure drama.   Interesting story; we'll leave it at that. You'll have to ask yourself.    Johnny's staff is on their social media / online reputation game like no other, going beyond the Yelp reviews. Something that's SOP in today's Customer Experience Battleground, yet so many business owners aren't consistent about monitoring.  For example, Carlos immediately recognized me as the "Gal who started a Talk thread about the Lobby's reboot". (http://www.yelp.com/topic/chandler-lobbys-burgers-rebooted-as-johnnys-burgers-and-dogs-rejoice#qN2iVwsVu98yzSns-eypqA) They were reading the thread before we came in. Neat!  I noticed no difference in the food or sauce. Went with my standby, a hearty, 1/3 lb lettuce wrapped bacon burger, topped with fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, huge pickle slices and a shared order of fries.   *drool*  Dude said the bun tasted a little different (I wouldn't know as I forgo them) but it wasn't a deal breaker.  . . . Sorry, Taric W. No Tacos Atoyac "Taco Divorce" drama here! ;)   Go ahead. Splurge for the larger cup of fry sauce. It sucks you have to pay extra, but oh-so-worth it!   That 20% off a combo check-in offer will help you out.   Can't wait to try the Italian Beef!  All the best to you and your business, Johnny. And PLEEEEEAAAAASE - Don't go mysteriously closing up shop again - The last time almost sent me to rehab!

**Full disclosure: My sister is an employee of Nothing Bundt Cakes. However, I have been a customer since the early 2000s ... Long before she was legally able to hold down a job. Can I get an amen for all those cake decorators and sales gals out there?!**  I love Nothing Bundt Cakes! Remember the days when it was this store plus one other, so very happy to see that they're expanding.   Thankfully, more stores didn't lead to changes in terms of their products, or the personal customer service with a smile.  Delicious, moist cakes, meticulously packaged and decorated and to die for cream cheese frosting is what you're getting into.   Red Velvet, Chocolate Chocolate Chip and my latest favorite: Turtle (Chocolate, Caramel, Pecan, amazeballs frosting included).   You can sample cake flavors before you buy one. There's always a special flavor of the month.  Shout out to the baby sis for my beautiful birthday cake this year!  You can get a full sized Bundt, or a Bundtlet if you want to provide a friend, coworker, client, etc. with a sweet surprise.   Or if you're a piglet like me and just craving some Turtle cake. Boom, roasted!  Just remember, "Stressed" is just "Desserts" spelled backwards, so head over to NBC for some sweet de-stressing!

Oh, Barrio Queen.  The week prior, I had met up with a group of Yelpers for a farewell dinner at the Scottsdale location.   Review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/barrio-queen-scottsdale?hrid=UANP8WNpEH6ID8O1ho19uw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)   tl;dr  Delicious food, Crazy Woman treated Dude and I like Criminals-To-Be based on appearances, did NOT want to go back to Barrio Queen anywhere.   Missy F. was back in town from California, and suggested we meet here after her lifting session and my physical therapy appointment in South Gilbert.   I grabbed the same outfit I wore in Scottsdale (navy and white striped 3 in shorts, black v-neck t-shirt, black wedges) to change into after PT, but more importantly to do a test of sorts to see if I encountered the same level of harassment.   Missy had already grabbed a table, and informed me where she was.   Told the hostess, and she told me I was welcome to find my friend.   SUCK IT, SCOTTSDALE BARRIO QUEEN.   The food was delicious and service was above average.   Missy had some tacos,and I was able to order the Carne Asada Burrito in the same style as the Carne Asada y Chile Relleno taco.   Tender, delicious beef, perfectly spicy, and big enough for me to bring home the other half for  Dude to enjoy for dinner on his lunch break.  Next time a friend suggests Barrio Queen, I'll STRONGLY SUGGEST we hit up the Gilbert location.  Well done, team!

I walked into Wren House Brewing one chilly December evening, in love with my then-boyfriend (I've since been upgraded to fiancée, about damned time).   When we left, it's very possible I walked out more in love with their beer than with Dude.   Dude hosted his December 2015 "Brews Cruisin' the Valley UYE" here, and it was such a blast.   An adorably converted home, you'll find a bar, barrels turned over as tables, a beautiful community table and two worn-in armchairs by a fireplace that makes for the perfect date night.   Since this was right before Christmas, we all brought in homemade cookies to share with the group . . . Which eventually extended to fellow patrons!   Pst, this is another one of those places that doesn't have a kitchen. Sometimes there's food trucks; believe there's Panini available for purchase . . . Or you can bring your own grub. Do it!   We've been back many a time since. In fact, Dude dragged my butt back here the week after to take advantage of a Groupon for two flights since I was on vomit-inducing antibiotics the night of his UYE.  All their beers were phenomenal; I loved everything I tried (which doesn't happen often)!   Their flagship Jomax? Hohmahgawd. Oatmeal Stout topped with their Cold Brew?! Be still my beating heart.   The Señor Gallo lager was refreshing and lighter option.  The Collabricot (Apricot IPA combined with something from Fate Brewing) was an excellent, unique collaboration. Most Apricot beers I've had were of the Hefe variety.   But the one seasonal you absolutely cannot miss is the Chai Jolly. The only way I can really describe this one is a darker honey wheat, with obvious chai spices . . . Yet not too obnoxious.  This sunshine-in-a-pint-glass is tapped every year for Wren House's "Day After Christmas Party". Go next year!  We even took growlers of it home . . . Both were promptly destroyed prior to midnight on New Year's Eve.   This is easily one of my favorite breweries in the Valley, and I'm strongly considering having my Bridal Shower here.   Recommended to the fullest!

What's the big friggin' deal about Portillos?   Stopped by for lunch after picking up my sister's birthday gift at Tempe Marketplace hoping to find out, especially with many of my friends singing its praises.  Blech, that's what.  Soggy bun, tasteless relish, meh hot dog.  Also split a dipped Italian beef with Dude, and it was like chewing on grease. No, and not just because it was ordered dipped.   I've had better at another local eatery ran by a native Chicagoan.  Freezer-aisle esque crinkle cut fries. Charging for *pre-packaged ranch* as Andrea S. already mentioned.   This type of food by its nature isn't the most wholesome, but it left me nauseous as all get out for the rest of the day.   Not a big hot dog fan to begin with, so maybe I'm not the most reliable reviewer ... But there's definitely better dogs to be found in the Phoenix area.   Perhaps this was an off day for Portillos; however, not sure if I'll be back for a round two.

I had the misfortune of being rear ended by some self important punk texting on his phone.   No, seriously - Did I mention how much I hate you people who think this is OK? Yeah, I said it, you're assholes.   Thank goodness I wasn't hurt, but my less than 6 months old Toyota RAV4 was. :'(   Being that this was my first ever accident  I dropped in to see my insurance agent to ask her not where she recommends her clients take their vehicles post-wreck, but where she would take *her* mechanical baby.   It was then she handed me Jim at Precision Auto Body's business card.   From the moment I walked in, I felt at ease and that everything would be taken care of with professionalism.   Getting and dropping off the rental was a breeze, and Jim kept me posted throughout the week. I even got calls while I was working out of town.   It only took a week, and looks like nothing ever happened to my ride. What a relief!   With all of our insane drivers in this State, Auto Body Shops seem to be a Rite of Passage in Arizona.   I sure hope you never need their services because of an accident. But, if you find yourself driving in front of a bro that just haaaaaad to text his girlfriend back in rush hour traffic, Precision Auto Body is a solid team to restore your ride to its previous state.

Delicious San Tan Brews and music for $10 if you bought your tickets ahead of time at Bashas' - What's not to love?!  This by NO means a traditional Oktoberfest (or even the best in AZ as the emcee boasted; sorry bud, that title is reserved for the Lufthansa Flight School's Oktoberfest in Goodyear), but had a blast nonetheless.    Food and goods vendors invaded Dr. AJ Chandler park! Beers were $5/each, cash only, drink tickets.   Really enjoyed the Bratwurst from BratHäus and the fry bread from Department of Dough.   The live performances from Roger Clyne and Matisyahu were nothing short of incredible.  Had a blast dancing with my guy into the night!   And how about that encore of "One Day" - Matisayhu is so rad, dude let a few rowdy folks swarm the stage for a dance session.   I'll be back next year depending on the live music line up.  You, though? Check it out if you've never been!  Ein Prosit, my friends!

I've lived in Phoenix for 11 years, hiked many a trail at South Mountain Park - Heck, my parents' house is right off one of the popular trails - Yet I've never hiked Holbert Trail.   Until a lovely April Saturday, where I happened to have the day off from training.   Dude and I grabbed our Camelbaks, sunblock and ventured out to the trailhead.   Unlike other popular spots in Phoenix, there's ample parking and bathrooms.   As other reviewers have mentioned, it's 5 miles round trip, a steep change in elevation, and a difficult rating.   We hike quite a bit and only found this moderately challenging, but please, people - Be honest with yourselves. Know your limits, block up and bring PLENTY of water.    If it's during our treacherous summer, please don't be the dumbass we all hear about on the 10PM news - Start your hike well before 7AM.   Hike up Holbert Trail to Dobbins Lookout, where you'll be rewarded with an incredible view of the Valley. Replenish with some Omega-loaded trail mix (or snack of your choice) and head back down.   Some things to remember:   1) Keep your pets on a leash. 2) Pick up their leavings. 3) PICK UP YOUR TRASH, YOU FILTHY ANIMALS!  4) Be mindful of the wildlife. We saw some snakes and massive lizards that day. Remember, this is their home  - They're more afraid of you than you are of them.   Overall, another great hiking option to break away from the more popular trails and fun exercise.   Grab your homies and roll out!

In Hindi, Jalsa means:   1) Celebration 2) Festival  3) Fun   And let me tell you, with those Indian inspired ice cream flavors, there will most certainly be a celebration going on in your mouth.   Andrew C. and I dropped in on a whim last week after seeing Jalsa had opened up in the space once occupied by Mind Over Batter, aka "The Salad Store". Here's lookin' at you, Boo-Boo (Missy F.)!   When we walked in, the shop was very clean and modern. Jay was quick to greet us and make us feel welcome and asked how we discovered the store.   "Uhhh ... You guys were setting up shop when I stopped by in February to bring cupcakes to my very sick BFF in the hospital?"   *halo!*   Now, you should know that Jalsa also has cupcakes (have yet to try them) and your typical ice cream flavors.  But we made it clear to Jay that night that we were after those Indian delights, baby!   Jay let us sample just about everything: Saffron, Mango, Lightly Gingered, and a ton of others I honestly cannot remember due to the intense sugar high.  I ended up getting the Rose; Andrew C. the Cashew Raisin.  The Rose was super creamy, light and refreshing - Something that doesn't always happen with ice cream. So good; the Rose flavor was very noticeable, but not overpowering or artificial.  Oh, and about the product: Jay told us that with the exception of a few flavors made by vendors, Jalsa's ice cream is made in house!   And at just under $3 for a massive single scoop dish, how could you go wrong?   Supporting local never tasted so good.  Pst, a carryover from the previous business: Bring your ticket stub from Pollack Cinemas next door, and get a free scoop!  I can't wait to come back, and being that Jalsa is less than two miles from our home, I anticipate more late night drives / walks for ice cream. Danger zone! ;)
