Line moving slow. 15 mins to start ordering. Got order in and stood there while 4 people behind me in line were told to check out ahead of me while I waited for one of the 5 people working the line to cut chicken. Then was told an 8 minute wait for egg rolls. I passed at least a dozen restaurants to get here. Next time I'll go to one of those.

Here almost daily. They are always busy but keep the place very clean. Fast friendly service. Parking lot is chaotic but thats the only bad thing, and to be expected being so busy.   Also a safe spot. Not people hanging out front very often.

This applies for the Rio Salado on Northern: So after 3 times of trying to sign up my daughter, and being told 3 different occasions something new needs to be done, we are now in our 2nd week of achieving her GED. Not so fast.   My wife gets a call today from Caroline telling her that she needs to talk to my daughter to see how classes are going. My wife asks if there is anything wrong, she says no, end of conversation. Then Caroline immediately after calls my daughter and informs her that because she is 4 months away from turning 16 she must stop classes after going through pretesting and already starting classes. WHY DIDNT YOU TELL MY WIFE THIS 5 MINS BEFORE?! Why would you take it upon yourself to break down a 15 year old girl instead of informing the person you were just on the line with!? Why lie to my wife when she specifically asked you a question about your purpose?   We ran around for 4 weeks, taking time off of work, adjusting schedules, and were completely dedicated to achieving this goal just to find out it was all for nothing and have to do it all over again in 4 months. Needless to say we are requesting a refund of payment, and will find elsewhere to better ourselves because this BS was unnecessary and unprofessional to say the least.

Cant give negative stars.  So got this walked in with a meal that followed my diet and was going to get drinks and they told me I had to eat my meal outside on the curb. Fail fail fail

By far the best place to grab a sandwich or salad. Not your normal 'fast food' feel. Use real plates. Manager treats you like royalty. Never a bad experience

Food was great! Service a little above average. Fast and friendly. Only complaint is it's a little too loud to have a conversation.
