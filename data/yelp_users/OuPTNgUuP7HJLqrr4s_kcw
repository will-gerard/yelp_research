To whom it may concern,  About a week ago, our facility took a field trip to your restaurant.  I wasn't along on the trip, but being the President of the Resident Council, I take up all concerns from the residents.  Being along time customer of your restaurant and your bakery, I am concerned with how our residents were treated at your restaurant.  I was told how rude the service was, and that our residents were charged for more soda and for the bread at your place.  This is not the same restaurant I'm use to eating at.  My friends and family eat here all the time.  I even take my family here, and never had a problem.  I, for one like to support local restaurants when ever possible, but this is one restaurant I will not be returning in the near future and at our next resident council meeting, which is this Wed., we will make the announcement that we will never be returning to your restaurant for future field trips.  Our seniors live on a fix income and don't need to be treated the way they were treated.  I"m very disappointed that we have to severed ties with your restaurant, but we have to do what's right for our residents here at Bethesda Gardens.  Thanks for all the great years of service, but now we must move on.

I've been coming here since 1979.   They have some of the best pizza in Phoenix.  If you go, you must try their Sicilian pizza by the slice or a whole pie.  The owner is very personal and all the staff make you feel at home.  I go as much as I can.  I highly recommend everyone take a trip to Raffael's Pizza right behind 7/11 off of 19 Ave and Glendale.  They are in a strip  center in the back.  Enjoy if you go.
