My husband & I are frequent diners here. We love that it's family-owned, they always remember us & are always very friendly & sweet. The sushi, as well as the other dishes we've tried are always delicious.  The California rolls are probably the freshest, best rolls in Phoenix!

Ill start by saying we love SmashBurger! We've been to a few different locations and have always been very pleased, with the exception of this location. We've been here three or four times, and what strikes us each time is that while it is rarely busy, many of the tables are dirty. The drink station is dirty, as well. Today, the table we chose has empty salt and pepper shakers and no napkins (which are typically on each table).  While the service is mediocre, the food has at least always been good.

Looks cute & fun, so we thought we'd give it a try. We started with chips & salsa & 7 layer 'deconstructed' (read COMPLICATED) dip. The chips were burned & were the texture of cardboard. We ordered the fish tacos, which were way too breaded & also kind of burned. It was actually like a fish stick inside a tortilla. The cabbage actually has sugar on it. The service was really bad, and we were never quite sure who our server actually was. They gave us a VIP card that we can use at all their Valley locations, but - OOPS! - we left it on the table...

Best Middle Eastern food in the Metro Phoenix area! Their rice is unbelievable! Our orders are always spot on, and the restaurant is very clean and well-maintained. The owners, Bill and sons, are very customer service oriented and always take time to chat. They remember and acknowledge their regulars, which means a lot these days.  Even if I did not live in the area, I would travel here for the food, ambience and experience.
