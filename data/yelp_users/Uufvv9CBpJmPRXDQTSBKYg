Really love this place.  It has a very home feel to it and everyone is super nice. Food is not stellar, but way above average and well worth the extra trip.

Over the years this place has been our main-stay.  We go for one thing, the Surfer Roll.   It is the best roll we have ever had, or ever found anywhere.  The place is just solid.  Good price, good service and a lot of fun.   Take our tip... forget sitting in the dining room.  Sit at the bar, take the recommendations of whoever is working behind the counter, and order at least one Surfer.  You won't be disappointed.

What can you say about Red Lobster.  It has been around for ages and is just flat out hit or miss.  Some days the food is great, some others, not so much.  What I'm beginning to believe in my old age is that this is just the nature of fish places.  You are only as good as your fish you get off the truck that day.  I mean really...  We live in the desert.  Getting fresh seafood here is a challenge at best. However, this... was a good day. Everything was fresh and tasty, the wait staff was nice and the price was not horrible.  (The drinks kick it up fast tho)   Damn you long island ice tea!  A good experience and we'll go again.

The best spider roll I have had in any sushi place I have ever been in.  Awesome!  If you're into soft-shell crab rolls like I am, you are always looking for the best.  So far... this one tops the list.  Good balance of ingredients and very fresh.  A must try on your next time out.

I had posted a review while in the restaurant, but realized that the few words I prattled off did not do justice to the experience.  All these other positive reviews this place has, I do not understand.  So here is the real review this place deserves:  First off, the entrance to the place.  I get that this franchise is trying to sell the idea of fresh/healthy food.  Salad is suppose to be healthy.  However, walking in the first thing you notice is the dead and dying hanging herb garden.  This assortment of plants look as though they had not seen anyone's attention in months.  Given the storms in the valley, I would have given this a pass, but once inside the door, you are greeted with baskets full of rotting red peppers and Leaks that have been ignored for so long they had mold growing in the stems.  (Not exactly what you call fresh)  You can tell it was nothing more than a thoughtless display that was tossed together months ago and forgotten.  Next the price.  26$ for two people to eat lunch...  Really... for a buffet?   I understand that healthy food is more expensive.  (Pita Jungle regularly gets my dollars) The price would not be that far out of line if the food quality was there to support the price.  Or if it was fresh, made-to-order like PJ.  (This was not)  So the food.  Bland, no seasoning, pre-packaged tasting and gross.  As I got my plate and stepped into the line I was met with wet, wilted over dressed greens.  They were soaking in a bowl of water and dressing.  Not a good start.  I picked a few of the other items as a sample, expecting to find something worth coming back for.  Alas, I never came back to this line for many reasons, but mostly because nothing had any flavor.  If was mostly texture and the idea of salad.     I continued on to the soup.  Several selections, but again, you could tell nothing was fresh and everything came out of a commercial plastic bag.  No flavor, and not a speck of salt or seasoning.  Bland and flavorless.    I then tried the mac n cheese and other pasta choices, hoping for something to save the meal.  No luck...  No seasoning, bland and gross.  The mac and cheese would have been better if it came out of a box.  The oil rising to the top of the cheese sauce you could wick off with your napkin.  Last chance to save the meal, I hit the potato bar.  (I mean, how do you screw up a potato?)  They found a way!  The potato was so over-cooked that it had the texture of chalk... Hot, flavorless, chalk.  Even with all the toppings, I could not get past the texture.  Then came the extra-special bonus.  A piece of plastic.  (Looked like the tip of a bag  clip)  Hey... It happens, so not a big deal, but...  Where did it come from?  The potato was whole, so it had to have been in with the toppings right?  (The mystery of the rouge plastic bag clip bugged me the whole drive home.)  All in all...  This place is off my list for good.  Even if they cleaned up their act, I'm not sure that I would give it a try again.  For the price I can do sushi, Pita Jungle or just about any other healthy alternative for the same price or less.  No, this is not a place I would ever recommend or return to again. MRM

Can't believe in all the years going to this place I never did a review.  Yes... it's expensive.  Yes, it is a smoking bar.  But the atmosphere and service if beyond anything you have ever experienced.  That's why we keep going back again and again.  Special events are fun and well run.  You feel like a VIP every time you walk in the door.

If I was reviewing this 4 years ago, then it would be 5 stars, these days, 2 stars is being generous.  We used to go to this place once a week (Seriously)  Now, you couldn't drag us back.  The burgers (Which were amazing back then) have become thin, greasy slabs of charred crap on stale buns.  The beer is the same as every other dive bar, and the place looks like it was moved from a town in the midwest lost in the 1970's.  Don't waste your time, there is nothing left to see here.

Holy crap!  Where has this place been all my life?   Really.  I'll put this place up against any chain in town.  Hand made and family owned.  This may even be worth a trip if you are not in the area. Try 'em.  I think you'll agree.

Let me start by saying this is not a one-off review.  I have been going to this place for years and it was very good. (Not the best, but good).  This morning my wife and I took a trip over for my fav menu item. Machaca breakfast burrito with potato.  I've had this many times in the past but OMG!  I could not even finish it.  It tasted like old used fryer grease and did not even have an egg in it.  How do you call it breakfast without an egg?   Just mushy mashed potatoes with a tiny bit of hamburger in it.  (Yes burger. Not even real roast beef)  Worse yet the portion size had reduced to 1/3its normal size (barely 3 bites of filling) and was still wrapped in the usual giant tortilla.  Anyone that has been here before knows how good those are.  Er... Used to be.  The tortilla had the same used grease taste as the rest.  My wife had the chicken taco and even it had suffered major changes and used grease taste.  (How do you mess up a taco?)  I am so sad and will be reluctant to return anytime soon  Beware, this place may be on the way out.

Someday before I die, I would love to try this pizza.  Let me say that I have lived just a couple miles away from this place for the past 10 years and have only seen it open a handful of times.  The signs keep changing, I watched as the original owner left and as the "Original Johnny" returned to a big banner that flew outside the place.  Yet every single time that we have tried to go check the place out... Closed.  The hours on the door say one thing, but it seems that is just a rough estimate of when someone will grace you with a pizza. Someday....  Maybe I can try it and write a review about the pizza.

Reclining seats rock.  This one is close to the house.  Nothing super special about the theater, but it is the only one that we use for the 2+ hrs movies.  The seats let you survive the flick without your butt going completely numb.  ;-)

One of the best places in town for hearty cooking.  There is little on the menu that I have not liked.  The portions are perfect sized and it never disappoints.  We eat here at least once a month or so.  On rare occasions we have had a less than stellar meal, but even then it is above average.   For breakfast... it is awesome.

Small company. Great service. Fast turn around time and great prices. What more can you ask for?

Parang noodle is the best.  Mega heat, but even more flavor.  Get it once, you will be a fan for life.

Wow what a find.  This was a last minute decision on a Friday night when we did not want to wait for hours to get into some other over-hyped restaurant.    Let me tell ya, this place does not look like much, but the food is amazing.  Fresh, clean, and done as well as I have had in places for three times the price.   The kid behind the counter could not have been better.  Friendly, fun and suggesting the specials with a smile. We will be back, and for the Saffron Ice Cream.  ;-)

As with ALL buffets, they start out good, then slip into meh, or worse.   The first time we tried this place it was nice.  (Buffets are never great, its the nature of doing cafeteria style food) The selections this time were just as vast as the first time we tried them, but alas, the quality is so hit-n-miss that I must pass on this place in the future.  Not only was the food ranging the scale from good to gross across the various dishes, it was also doing so on the same dish.  My first trip through the line I got pot stickers and some really nice sole, after several minutes I returned to finish off with the stuff I knew was good and in just that time, the food quality dropped to... yuck! At $20 a plate, I don't expect it to be Roy's Hawaiian Fusion, (Check that out sometime) but I do expect to be able to get through a meal without wanting to vomit.  (Yes, some things just about got me to that point.) Look, I love to experiment with food, nothing scares me, but I do require that if you are going to present me with something new and unusual, you prepare it in the proper way to highlight the ingredient.  Epic fail on many of the dishes here.  Oh and I forgot to mention the sushi that was made from fish so old that it should not have been used for any kind of dish.  I have had pre-packaged stuff from the grocery store that was not as fishy tasting.  All in all, I'll spend another $20 a plate and get something awesome.

This was an incredibly awesome flooring experience.  What can you say about a company that sends someone out with samples and installs the carpet the very next day.  (Now let me say that they are getting very popular and they are short staffed because of demand.) That just means they are good.  It took a couple days to get on track, but once we were on the schedule it was perfect. The colors were spot on from the samples and the carpet was actually better quality for less money than anything I have ever had installed from Depot or Lowes.  The installer was fantastic and did one of the best job I've ever had. One qualification.  I have been a contractor for many years and have put in many, MANY, rooms of carpet.  So when I say this is the best ever... that should mean something to y'all.  ;-) Don't hesitate, they are a great company.

This was by far the most amazing birthday evening ever.   First off, this place is not for the financial faint of heart.  At $150 a plate, it is on the high end of meals I have ever had.  So would I do it again?  We booked our next evening before we left. The tasting menu was an epic event.  Course after course of quality dishes that superseded the previous.  Topping things off with the best custard dish that I've ever had.   The staff was amazing.  Friendly, involved, attentive and just great folks.  They even gave my wife a birthday card signed by the entire staff.  Talk about attention to detail and really serving the guests.   If you like sushi, you will love this place.

Super friendly and good prices.  Give up the commercial eye places and support local.  These folks will do a great job and really listen to your needs.  You can't go wrong here.
