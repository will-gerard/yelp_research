I have to say I've always had pretty decent washes from this location, regardless of the other posts I have seen.  Detail service is overpriced for the attention of detail...but the washes are good to me.

Was here for a team building evening this past Friday.  We had a great time except their computer system went down, we still got everything we needed, it just took a little longer....and no race stats, bummer.  I didn't want to not give 5 stars because of the computers, but one employee at the front desk was very short and rude with me and the members of our party, that cost the 5th star.  And yes, we were well behaved.  If we had not experienced her poor attitude all would have been perfect.

I whole-heartadly and HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.....the service was perfect and the food was phenominal.....we ate here for my wife's birthday on August 1st and I can't say enough.  I love the tastings between courses, the exceptional food quality and energetic staff.  They have taken a strip mall location and made it one of the best dining options in the area.  Congratulations!

I think Butter & Me cupcakes are awesome.....also, I have to say something in response to Veronica D's comments.  I buy cupcakes for my kids birthday parties and some special occassions because it is less of a hassel and easier to serve.....obviously Veronica D hasn't shopped around for a cake that serves 12 or more people or other cupcake vendors as the pricing is very much competitive for what you get!!!! A big fan.

Absolute and complete incompetence.  I've had to spend over two hours and numerous phone calls to figure out why I am being charged erroneous amounts on my credit card from DS Water, aka Sparkletts Water.  Upon updating my credit card in late June with their accounting department, they not only were charging my current account each month, but also my past closed credit card account.  They were tacking on insufficient funds fees and stating I owed them money when I was current the entire time.  Finally, after getting to a manager, she apologizes that they made a mistake and it will be fixed.  By this point, I was furious and simply asked that they cancel my account and pick up the cooler.....note, I have been a customer for over 7 years!!!  They blamed it on a system merging problem when they purchased O Premium Water but that doesn't make any timing sense.  While she did her best to save the account, I had just had it.  I had to explain the story three times and the first two times I was told I owed more money, but when I finally got to a supervisor, the story changed, apologies were made and reassurance that my account was current and that all the fees that were charged in error would be reversed.  Still, I can't continue to patronize a company that blames the consumer first and then researches the problem to find it was their fault.  So, that was last week, they picked up the cooler the next day, took all the empty and unused bottles, and that should have been the end of the story.  RIGHT?!?!  Wrong.  Today, again, another charge on my account, are you kidding me?!!?  Another 25 minutes on hold to be told yet again, it will be immediately resolved.  I RECOMMEND THAT YOU STAY AWAY FROM THESE FOLKS OR IF YOU DO EMBARK ON THEIR SERVICES, DO NOT SET UP AUTO PAYMENT WITH THEM.  I don't want to cancel my credit card because one business entity can't get it right, but if it happens again, that's what I will have to do.  Booooo!

Still no refund as promised..... 120+ minutes of my time on phone calls 7 phone calls total 2 managers promising a refund is in process 0 refunds and now being directed to the corporate office accounting director to obtain my $33.99 back that was billed after the account was closed.  Wait for it, because I will bet that $33.99 that at the end of this month, I will be charged yet again!!!  Stay away from Sparkletts and DS Waters, they know nothing about customer service or billing challenges.

A buddy and I go here for lunch once a month.  It is a great place, lots of sports on television, but with food that is far better than a typical sports bar.....plus the staff is extremely attractive....not a bad deal!
