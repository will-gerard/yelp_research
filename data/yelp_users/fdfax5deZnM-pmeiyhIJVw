I hate this Safeway. I don't even think it's that ghetto, and I've never had a problem with things being out of stock. Even the prices are pretty good. This is the closest grocery store to my house and I try to never shop there if I can help it. The reason? There are NEVER enough cashiers. I have never ever ever ever ever ever gone in and seen more than 2 cashiers working. Why do they even have 10 checkout lines if they're only going to use ONE most of the time? This is one of the only groceries downtown so I don't understand why they would close early(...10pm I think), and have one lonely cashier working during BUSY times. I once came here in the evening around 9 and stood in line for 40 minutes to pay for the one or two things I had bought. I couldn't believe it. That was over 2 years ago, and nothing has changed here, and you KNOW they get complaints about it, but they're obviously not changing anything. You would be better off going to the Bashas or Safeway on 7th Ave & Osborn, or Fresh and Easy on 7th Ave and Indian School. Any time you would have saved driving to the closer grocery store would be more than lost standing in their outrageous checkout lines.

I went here searching for some of my favorite Mexican candies. I struck gold!! This is a clean, well organized store that has an enormous selection of Mexican candies, many in bulk. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I come here and I stock up on my favorite snacks, and I always try some new ones. I'm never disappointed!

I had LASIK done here in June 2012. I was initially drawn to it by Tim G's review, hoping that I would also qualify for the $299 per eye prices. Unfortunately, when I had my consultation they quoted me about $8-900 per eye for traditional LASIK. (I can't remember the exact price they quoted). My contact prescription was -2.50 in both eyes. I was a little bummed and decided that I didn't want to continue and I left. I was already starting to regret that I didn't just get it over with, as it was something I'd been wanting for awhile, when about a week later, they called me and offered me a lower price. They told me that they could do it for $599/eye for the traditional technology if I did my surgery on a specific date. I took them up on their offer and scheduled for a Friday morning. I decided to do all of my pre-LASIK appointment and my surgery on the same day, so I arrived early that morning, had everything done, spent a very long time waiting around being nervous (as your eyes can not be dilated for the surgery, and that is part of the exam to make sure you are qualified for LASIK), and then had my surgery around 3pm. I am very very pleased with my results. If you are thinking about having LASIK surgery done, I highly recommend the Lasik Vision Institute. I couldn't be happier with them!

I've heard that you're not supposed to ask people for recommendations for a dentist, because everyone thinks they have the best dentist. Well, I KNOW I have the best dentist! After nearly 10 years of neglecting my dental health (nothing hurt, nothing looked bad...), I figured it was probably time to get a check up and cleaning with a dentist. Baseline Dental was one of the closest dentists to my house, so I decided to give it a try.   Well, it turned out that just brushing definitely wasn't enough, and I needed something like 11 fillings. I also still have all of my wisdom teeth, and Dr. Chris said that if they aren't bothering me, why pull them out? Cool with me. I was never ever made to feel ashamed/guilty for not flossing or seeing the dentist for so long, which I really appreciated. The front desk staff and Dr. Chris really worked with me to keep the price down for the dental work I needed, and helped me sign up for a dental discount plan called Careington that has probably saved my husband and me thousands of dollars over the last few years. In fact, when my husband most likely needed a pricey root canal+crown, Dr. Chris said he would try something else that cost much less, and it has held up for several years now. I completely trust Baseline Dental to recommend only the treatments that I need. I found Dr. Chris's bedside manner to be great and I have always felt at ease when I am there. I have never felt the slightest bit of pain when he does my fillings or gives me the big shot of numbing juice. If you think you're one of those people that is afraid of the dentist, I bet that Dr. Chris will change your mind. I love seeing Suzanne for my 6 month cleanings. She is great at making conversation and if she asks you a question, she stops what she's doing, so that you can actually answer her, lol. She's given me lots of tips for flossing and brushing and I actually take the time to do it right. I can't believe that I used to think that I was doing a good job at taking care of my teeth... For as long as I live in Arizona, I will be coming to Baseline Dental. :-D

I love the Bikini! It is my favorite bar in the world. The music is always way too loud, and the crowd is the best of any bar I've ever been to. The beer is super cheap, so make sure you just buy a pitcher...no one will judge you for drinking straight from the pitcher! It gets really busy on Tuesday and Saturday nights, so wear your dancing shoes, since you probably won't be able to find a seat anyways! And don't forget to bring cash! They are cash only!

We've lived right down the street from this restaurant for 2 years before we checked it out on Yelp and realized that we were definitely missing out on some great Mexican food!! As soon as you walk in, you are seated quickly and they bring you some of the best chips and salsa that I've ever had in my life. And then they bring you refills of chips and salsa until you finally think that maybe you should stop and save some room for your actual meal. So then when your food does get there, the first thing you'll think is "Holy crap that is a lot of food!" But it is AMAZING. I have only ever had the carne asada burro, but I don't think I'll ever get anything else from here. It is a pillow-sized burro stuffed with chunks of steak, cheese and roasted bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. SO GOOD!! My husband has had a few of the other things and he swears that it is some of the best Mexican food that he's ever had, too.  The $1.75 margaritas are not bad, and they compliment the food really well. My whole meal was about $10, and I still had half of it leftover to take home! Besides the food, the service here is impeccable. The waiters are all very attentive to what you need and they are very polite and FAST!

CALLING ALL BEER LOVERS! (Even if you think you don't like beer, Papago probably has a brew to change your mind.) This place is great! They always have something like, 30 beers on tap, one on cask, and also a huge selection of hundreds of bottled beers in their coolers. Their draft selection changes almost daily, except for a few staples. The Papago Brewery beers are great, and sometimes they even make special batches with peppers, etc.  One of the things that makes Papago so special, though is their staff. All of their staff members are incredibly friendly and helpful. They will remember you and make friendly chat with you and then suggest a beer for you if you can't pick.  Papago is kind of a drive for me and my husband, but we always wind up here a couple of times a week for a few pints and a pizza. Oh, I forgot to mention that their pizza is amazing!! We always get the white pizza and we loveeee it!!!

So, I had been looking for a tanning salon near ASU that wasn't quite as expensive as Sunchain. I noticed the sign along Scottsdale Road that said "TANNING $19.95/MONTH," and thought what the hell, why not? I stopped in one evening, and the guy that helped me was so friendly and explained everything about their tanning beds and prices. This place actually has 12 tanning beds, both stand-up and lay-down, that are not old pieces of junk. They are actually really cool! They have built in radios, and extra functions, and the place is very clean. Their prices make perfect sense too. They have three levels of packages you can buy: a $20, $40 and a $60?( I can't remember the price for the higher one.) and all are good for 31 days of unlimited tanning. They also sell all kinds of tanning lotion, and although I don't really like using that stuff, I know it is expensive, and the guy assured me that they sell it for cheaper than most tanning salons. You don't need an appointment to come in, and there is never a wait. I am very happy that I decided to stop in here, and I think that more people should know about this tanning salon, since it is kind of hidden in a weird shopping plaza.  SO, if you are sick of paying nonsense "membership fees," "activation fees", etc....just drive a little bit farther south on Scottsdale Road and check out One Stop Nutrition!

I kept hearing about this place, but never actually tried it until just recently. My husband and I looked up the address and when we got there, we weren't sure if we were actually at a bar.... The bar itself is a really cute historic house that is pretty dark on the outside.  As soon as we came in, we were greeted by the bartender and told to sit wherever we liked. The thing about this bar, is that they have kept the walls of the original house pretty much intact, so you have the choice of sitting in various rooms with little tables or couches tucked into every nook and cranny. The other thing about the Roosevelt is that it is very dark with many of the rooms being lit only by a few tabletop candles.  We ended up sharing a long dining table with another small group and made ourselves comfortable. But then when we looked at the beer list and menu, we almost fell out of our chairs! The Roosevelt offers a very large selection of craft beers, in bottles and on tap, and for very fair prices! They also have a small food menu that looks delicious, but we haven't tried yet...we keep forgetting to save room for the food! The service is friendly and efficient, and the music selection is impeccable as well. Like another Yelper mentioned, I could imagine that if it were really dead in here or quiet, you might feel like you had just walked into someone's living room and interrupted everyone, which might be awkward, but I have only ever been here at night when there are usually at least a few groups here.

I hate that this Circle K is so conveniently located to my house and so close to the freeway, but it is quite possibly the most inconvenient store to visit. I don't know if it's the layout of the parking lot/driveways, the fact that there are only 4 gas pumps, or what, but there seems to ALWAYS be a huge mess of cars and very rude people all trying to pile over each other.  Other than the parking situation, this is a safe and clean convenient store with friendly clerks who try to run things as smoothly as possible while forcing a smile.

I signed up for the 4 hour long CPR and First Aid class. I was afraid that the class would drag and that I would regret choosing to spend my Friday night here. It was actually a really fun and interesting experience! I had Paula as my instructor, who has lots of Real Life Emergency EXPERIENCE working as a volunteer EMT for the MCSO. Her stories made the content even more interesting and relevant. I feel much more prepared to act in case of an emergency, although I hope I'll never have to use it!

My husband and I were looking for a gym to join that was near downtown Phoenix. I used to go tanning here, and I remembered that they had (what I thought was) a little fitness center. We saw all the good Yelp reviews for their gym and called them yesterday and found out that it is only $20/month to join this gym and that they are open Mon-Fri from 5am-11pm, and weekends from 7am-7pm. We are definite night owls, and for only $20 a month, we were sold! So we went in last night and bought our memberships, and when we went into the gym we were really impressed! Their gym is actually pretty big and they have lots of modern, clean weight machines and cardio machines. They also have an area for free weights, and an area for stretching and doing sit-ups, etc. The whole gym is very very clean, and when we went on a Friday night, there were hardly any people using the facilities. I was glad that we didn't have to stand around and wait for a treadmill/weight machine to open up.  The girl that worked there also told us that as gym members, we get half off of their tanning prices if we wanted to tan as well.  I am so happy that we decided to purchase gym memberships again, and I can't wait to go work out again!

Mm M MMMMMM!!! A 24-hour drive thru serving up my fast food favorites!!! It is conveniently located, and despite the questionable hygiene of the crowd that streams through here, this restaurant is very clean. Another plus is that they have a double drive-thru and extremely efficient and polite employees to go along with it. I never have to wait for my food very long at all!

I went here for the first time today for a mani-pedi and I received some of the best service I have ever gotten at a nail salon! When I walked in, they had me pick my colors and immediately got me started in a pedicure throne that had the perfect massage in it, and while one technician painted my toes, another did my fingernails. They were very particular to details every step of the way, and I received a nice foot and arm massage that included hot stones! One of the technicians made it a point to say hello to every customer in the place and made everyone feel welcome, I think his name was Billy? My nails look great and shiny and I only paid $33 before tip for the best mani-pedi I have ever received!

WOW you should try the gel manicures that they offer here! They are about $28 which seems expensive for just a manicure, but they seriously last for 2 weeks without chipping and they look really shiny! The gels are made by OPI and come in a range of their most popular lacquers. I have had 2 people do them here now, and I will never get a regular manicure ever again!

If it weren't for this place being practically right next door to me, my car would never get washed. Ever since Clean Freak moved right next door to me though, I have been taking advantage of their super-cheap membership!! I only pay $17 a month (their most expensive package) and I get unlimited detailed car washes, free vacuums, a little Armor-All wipe, and air fresheners! I wash my car here almost every other day and I have no complaints.

I was so happy when I found out that Caroline was working here! She is seriously the best esthetician ever! She is the only one that I will allow to wax my eyebrows and she does it perfectly every single time! She really understands what I'm asking for and I leave with perfectly arched brows every time. She should really be charging a lot more for her exceptional brow waxes!  She is so friendly and accommodating and I would recommend her to anyone who is looking for a brow wax! Another plus is that this brand new salon is beautiful with modern decorations and furniture and is located in downtown Phoenix's Cityscape. There is a parking garage located underground that is easy to find and make sure you bring your ticket with you because Par Exsalonce validates your parking stub!  This salon is clean and convenient and they even offer online booking! But if that's not your thing, the girls at the front desk are so helpful and friendly and Carmen is so pleasant and knowledgable on the phone. Go see Caroline and you won't be disappointed!!

Unfortunately, my favorite aesthetician, Caroline, left to move on to bigger and better things. I saw a few different people for brow waxes in the past few months, finally returning to Par Exsalonce to see Deanna this week. I absolutely loved her! I am trying to grow my brows into a new fuller shape, and she completely listened to my concerns. I left with beautifully groomed brows not too thin, not too thick. She paid very close attention to detail and I couldn't be more pleased. I couldn't recommend her more! I will be seeing her from now on. I also love Par Exsalonce's online booking feature that allows me to see my last appointment date and book the same service with one click.

Crescent has addressed the bathroom situation that I was so frustrated about before and now I have nothing bad to say about this venue. This is a great place to see a show or to just hang out in the lounge/patio. Their drinks and food are fantastic and priced right. The bartenders and servers are always quick and friendly. I love this place!

I have been to this salon at least 15 times for pedicures, and each time it is ok, for the price. However today is the last time I will ever give them my money. I walked in, and didn't have to wait at all. I used the restroom before I sat down, and there was NO hand soap in the bathroom! GROSS. I rationalized it in my mind because they were wearing gloves, but then I realized they weren't even changing them between clients. When the girl started on my pedicure she was aggressively clipping the skin around my nails and it really hurt! Then, she dragged the nail file rapidly across the tender skin she had just clipped too deep. Ouchhhh. It's hard to explain, but when it came time to polish, she grabbed each of my toes by the front between her thumb and her extremely sharp nail on her pointer finger. Her nail, of questionable cleanliness, (don't know where the gloves went...) was cutting into the raw skin in front of my nails and it was extremely painful. I told her that it hurt, and she would stop for a second but then go right back to it. The polish wound up super thick and not smooth, and as she was taking the toe separators out, she stuck her finger right into the polish on my big toe. She haphazardly tried to fix it, but I lied and said to just leave it, I had to get going. I couldn't stand to have her nasty nail slicing into my skin any longer and I was frustrated by this waste of time and money. I came right home and repainted my nails myself and washed my feet thoroughly! Exclusive Nails is just down the street and though they aren't open on Sundays or Mondays, they have FAR superior service and cleanliness standards and their pedicures are only $2 more than at Pretty Nails. I will be going there from now on for my pedicures.

On a whim on Saturday evening, my husband and I decided to try our luck at getting a table at Pizzeria Bianco. We didn't have reservations, we just walked in on a Saturday night at dinner time. We didn't think we would really be able to be sat without a very long wait. We were originally told a 20 minute wait, but then the host said that if we wanted to, we could just sit at the bar, as it is full service, so we did that. We couldn't believe that we were sat right away!  The female bartender that was taking care of us was absolutely wonderful. She was being bombarded with drink orders from the servers and patrons at the bar, but never seemed stressed at all, and checked on us at frequent intervals.  Our pizzas were dropped off by the same guy that was at the host stand when we walked in, and he asked if we needed anything else, and within one minute, he brought us back the condiments we asked for, as well as a plate of bread and olive oil. The place was absolutely packed and crazy, but all of the staff maintained friendly attitudes and were very quick with everything.  Of course, our food and drinks were excellent, and we left stuffed! I'm sure this review will get buried under the hundreds of other reviews for Pizzeria Bianco, but I was just so incredibly pleased with the level of service that I received this past weekend and I wanted to pass along the compliment!

On our way to the Chipotle in the same complex today, my husband and I were accosted by one of the staff members encouraging us to come in and try How Do You Roll. The menu looked interesting and affordable, so we decided to give it a try. We were told it was their first day of business and we were excited to try it. It is basically build your own sushi roll. It is a lot like Subway or Chipotle, where you pick your rice, wrapper, veggies, raw meat, cooked meat, sauces, and toppings as you walk from one end of the counter to the other. They had a great selection of ingredients and I was impressed by the toppings and sauces that were available, including sesame seeds, spicy mayo, wasabi mayo, masago, etc. My husband and I each had one roll and a cup of miso soup for a grand total of about $16. The rolls were pretty good and the veggies were crisp and fresh. Each roll is cut into 10 large pieces and won't leave you hungry. While the miso soup had a good flavor, I wished it hadn't tasted so watered down. The staff members were very friendly and paid careful attention to every detail. One employee even picked up our table for us when we were finished eating.  All in all, I am glad that we had lunch here, and we will definitely go back soon and try a new combination of ingredients in our rolls!  We are happy to welcome How Do You Roll into the neighborhood and hope that they do well!

This place is a dump. I am not into the EDM scene and have never seen a show here, but have been here twice for the RAWards. First of all, they were charging $10 a head to get in, which I'm sure a portion goes to support the artists, but still. Once inside, the drink prices are way too high. If I remember correctly, a 12oz bottle of Bud Light was $6, and a teeny tiny shot of Fireball was $9. Sorry, but you don't get to charge Vegas prices at a dilapidated building in Phoenix. The lower level is OK I guess, and it worked to set up the runway and jewelry stands and stuff. The patio was nice. I could have done without the vendor making frybread, resulting in everyone smelling heavily like fried food, but the heaters they had set up did make it a little more comfortable.  The restroom situation was appalling. They had a BATHROOM ATTENDANT, and half the toilet stalls were either missing a toilet SEAT, or a stall lock, or something. How can they charge so much for drinks and cover, and not be able to take care of very basic maintenance like this? And then expect me to pay someone to wash my hands? The upper level was cool, once I found it and got up there. I liked the additional bar upstairs. The floor in the hall to the stairwell was missing tiles and was very uneven which they decided to just cover with a rug. Pretty dangerous, especially when you have women wearing heels. Also, the elevator permit expired in like...1997. Whoa.

Last year, I walked in here to see if anyone could get me in for a Gelish manicure, and luckily, Shannon was available right away. She really took her time to make sure they turned out perfectly, and they lasted for a month without any chips at all! I knew after that visit that I wouldn't be going anywhere else to get my nails done ever again.  I continued to see Shannon every few weeks for gel manicures and I left very impressed every time. The one time that I asked for nail art, she did it exactly how I wanted and it was absolutely perfect. Recently, I decided to get longer nails and wanted to try Shannon's hard gel technique. This is really like nothing else, and I think it is way better than acrylics. It is stronger and shinier and bonds to your entire nail, so they will never pop off no matter what. The gel is also thinner than acrylics so when it grows out, you don't have a huge bump. I've been wearing them for 6 weeks now, and they have never broken or chipped at all, they are seriously so strong! Shannon has a very good eye for shaping them perfectly, and is a total perfectionist. I wanted to try the new trend of pointy "stiletto" nails last time, and they came out better than I could have imagined. She custom blends the polish color of your choice into the gel, so the color will never chip, but since it's the top layer only, you can change the color every time you get them filled. And since she makes the colors custom, she can literally do ANY color you want.  Of course, the incredible quality of the services includes an extreme respect for cleanliness and sanitation. They make a big deal of having all their clean implements stored separately, used once, and then put away to be sanitized again. Shannon even sanitizes her hands right in front of me every time. Every product is labeled, and everything is a top of the line salon brand. There are no mystery lotions or oils in unmarked bottles here. To top all this off, Exclusive's prices are extremely fair. You are personally pampered and receive a VERY high quality service every time. You are never rushed through to get to the next waiting client and they never talk on the phone or to each other while ignoring you. I have found their prices to only be a couple dollars more than what you would pay at a typical nail salon in a strip mall. They do take walk ins, but because they do like to take their time with every client, I would recommend that you should probably call ahead and make an appointment just to make sure you get in. I have even called just one day before and got in the next morning.  After experiencing the serious quality and spa-like experience at Exclusive Nails, I will never go anywhere else!

Husband and I decided to check this place out for dinner last night. It was very easy to find, considering that they don't have a sign, just a chalkboard easel out front. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by a friendly male server who sat us right away and got us some water. We were one of only 2 tables when we got there....a Friday night around 8:45. First of all, I loved the decor inside....everywhere I looked there was something awesome hanging from the ceiling. The brightly lit tables are very neat, too.  As we looked over the short menu, the server made a few recommendations to us, and warned us about the spiciness of the food. He also told us that it is tapas style food so we could try a few things.  We started with the No Whey Jose Nachos.....AWESOME! They were SO SO good! I ordered the pesadilla quesadilla, halfway between "gringo style" and the normal amount of spice, as some Yelpers complained about it being way too spicy. It was SO good! However, I wished that I had just ordered it with full on spice, as the other two dishes we ordered "normal" and although they made me sniffle a little, I didn't think they were overbearing or too spicy at all!  My husband ordered the borrachita tacos which were wrapped in a crispy tortilla and were also incredible and nice and spicy! All in all, we loved this place and can't wait to try a few more dishes. Who knew that vegan Mexican food could be so flavorful? If you brought someone here without telling them it was vegan food, they probably wouldn't even notice....honestly! My one hang-up might be that it is VERY VERY dark inside. I couldn't even distinguish between a bite of refried beans and a bite of cheese sauce! The bathroom is also incredibly dimly lit....one very dim purple light, lol. Oh well, we came here for the food anyways, and we will definitely be back.....SOON!

Had a craving for some sashimi last night, and when I read that Squid Ink is open until midnight during the week, we decided to give it a try right that second! Upon entering, my husband and I were warmly greeted and we took our seats at the bar. The bartender, Asia, was helpful in explaining the menu and the drink options to us. We settled on the tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, and the spicy tuna roll. Everything we had was really delicious, and we were pleasantly surprised by the sashimi portions....6 LARGE pieces of the most succulent sashimi I've ever had for about $11. I felt like it was pretty reasonably priced for what you got. The spicy tuna roll was like no other spicy tuna I've ever had. It was actually REALLY spicy, and tasted like it was made in-house and not store-bought like many other places' spicy tuna. The decor is modern, and we learned that the painting on the walls is done by a local Phoenix artist, which I thought was really cool, because the murals are amazing and I love seeing local talent proudly showcased. It is conveniently located in the lower level of Cityscape and is unfortunately still a little obscured by some scaffolding all around it, so don't miss it! I am happy to have another late-night food option in downtown Phoenix, and since they have happy hour and TVs for sports, I can see me and my husband making quite a few return trips here.

Castaways is my JAM! I seriously love this place. It is such a good place to watch a game or just to hang out. Their drink prices are a screaming deal and they seem to always be running a kickass drink special. Their pizzas are also creative and delicious. We usually order the Obama Drama with red sauce. It is basically a Hawaiian pizza but it is covered in delicious bacon :) The bar has lots of TVs all over the place, a smoking patio, and bartenders with great attitudes. My husband and I spent about $30 for something like 4 shots of fireball, two pizzas, and 4 beers. Amazing. I just wish it were a little closer to my house since it never takes long before I'm in no shape to drive :)

This place is awesome. We come here once a week for dinner. My favorite pizza is the Hulk, and my husband loves the Hottie. Their pizza and beer is very good for the price, and the service is always fast and friendly. I've never experienced a wait to be seated here, and I've only ever gone on Saturdays.  The only little gripe I have is that I opted for the Build Your Own Pizza on my most recent visit, and added Parmesan to the pie for $1.45 extra, expecting shaved or shredded parmesan or something. Nope. As far as I can tell, I was charged $1.45 for the cook to shake powdered parmesan over it. The same parmesan they bring to your table for free. It was still good, but skip adding parmesan!

After coming here for the first time last weekend, I don't really understand the hate that this place gets. This past Sunday evening, my husband and I came in here as our first stop on Mill for the night. The first thing we noticed was that the place smelled AMAZING. Whatever air freshener they have is incredible! We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very attractive bartender who was quick with our drink orders and answered all of our questions. We had a few draft beers and their tequila bombers, which were super tasty and at a good price. The decor and atmosphere of the bar is great. I loved the pink accent lighting and the pattern on the booths. There was one group that had definitely imbibed a lot of liquor that day and were getting a little rowdy and dancing on top of the booths, but it's Mill, and I wasn't really surprised.  Overall, we had a blast, and we will definitely stop here every time we go to Mill Avenue!

Came here on Sunday afternoon for some wings, beer and Cardinals football! The owner was extremely accommodating to every guest and made sure that everyone who came in could watch their favorite teams, although most TVs and the sound were on the Cardinals game. The space itself is beautifully remodeled. There are dozens of TVs all over the place and you could easily watch several games at once no matter where you sat. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very accommodating and I never had an empty glass. I had the classic wings and they were incredible. I've never had smoked wings before, but I am now a convert.  They have a variety of craft, local, and domestic beers on tap, and for great prices. It was a great new place to watch football and I am happy to have them in the neighborhood!

Last year, I walked in here to see if anyone could get me in for a Gelish manicure, and luckily, Shannon was available right away. She really took her time to make sure they turned out perfectly, and they lasted for a month without any chips at all! I knew after that visit that I wouldn't be going anywhere else to get my nails done ever again.  I continued to see Shannon every few weeks for gel manicures and I left very impressed every time. The one time that I asked for nail art, she did it exactly how I wanted and it was absolutely perfect. Recently, I decided to get longer nails and wanted to try Shannon's hard gel technique. This is really like nothing else, and I think it is way better than acrylics. It is stronger and shinier and bonds to your entire nail, so they will never pop off no matter what. The gel is also thinner than acrylics so when it grows out, you don't have a huge bump. I've been wearing them for 6 weeks now, and they have never broken or chipped at all, they are seriously so strong! Shannon has a very good eye for shaping them perfectly, and is a total perfectionist. I wanted to try the new trend of pointy "stiletto" nails last time, and they came out better than I could have imagined. She custom blends the polish color of your choice into the gel, so the color will never chip, but since it's the top layer only, you can change the color every time you get them filled. And since she makes the colors custom, she can literally do ANY color you want.  Of course, the incredible quality of the services includes an extreme respect for cleanliness and sanitation. They make a big deal of having all their clean implements stored separately, used once, and then put away to be sanitized again. Shannon even sanitizes her hands right in front of me every time. Every product is labeled, and everything is a top of the line salon brand. There are no mystery lotions or oils in unmarked bottles here. To top all this off, Exclusive's prices are extremely fair. You are personally pampered and receive a VERY high quality service every time. You are never rushed through to get to the next waiting client and they never talk on the phone or to each other while ignoring you. I have found their prices to only be a couple dollars more than what you would pay at a typical nail salon in a strip mall. They do take walk ins, but because they do like to take their time with every client, I would recommend that you should probably call ahead and make an appointment just to make sure you get in. I have even called just one day before and got in the next morning.  After experiencing the serious quality and spa-like experience at Exclusive Nails, I will never go anywhere else!

My friends and I were craving some pierogies over the weekend and decided to see what Milk Bar had to offer. We came here on a Saturday night and our group of 6 was easily sat at a table on the patio. They have a great ambiance here including the music and rainbow mood lighting. Our server, Garrett, was friendly and helpful. We were interested in the "flag shots" that came in 3 varieties, and he suggested the pomegranate flavor which we all loved. He also recommended the meat and cheese pierogies with a vodka dipping sauce, which were also delicious...WAY better than the frozen kind at the supermarket which were the only kind I had ever had before. I wish we had ordered a few more! The selection of eastern European beers was very interesting although I wish the menu came with a pronunciation guide! I'll definitely come back to try some more items from their menu as well as explore the craft cocktail list.

Came here on a Saturday night and had an absolute blast! The staff behind the bar were incredibly helpful with helping us choose a drink. These guys definitely knew their stuff. In addition to craft cocktails, they also have a wide variety of beers available, both draft and cans/bottles. I prefer lighter beer so the bartender suggested the Bonus Round Blonde which is brewed for them by SunUp Brewery, and it was exactly what I was hoping for. We also split an order of the fried pickles which were a bit on the spicy side for me, but delicious. The games are all on free play and the selection included some of my favorites like Centipede, Galaga, Mortal Kombat, and Jurassic Park (complete with hydraulic bench.) The only things I would change is to make the chalkboard with the drink selections a little more simplified, as there is a lot going on and it's kind of hard to take it all in. It also would have been helpful to have had physical paper menus to look at the food/drink offerings. This is an awesome new place run by some people who really know what they're doing. I look forward to coming back here and working my way through the rest of the games!
