Love Chipotle and this location in particular has some of the most awesome and friendly employees! When something goes wrong, they always go out of their way to keep our experience positive. We always make the extra drive to go to this one every week because we love them so much :)

Going to preface this with the fact that my phone broke on short notice, giving me no access to the 端ber app.   In a pinch, I googled "cheapest taxi service in tempe az" and Sun Devil Taxi popped up.  The GOOD: -Requesting a car online was super fast and easy and I got an email right away. -The driver was not late -The seats were super comfy -Candy. (nuff said, right?)  The BAD: -My driver showed up 15 minutes earlier than my scheduled time (I requested maybe 2-3 hours in advanced)  -My driver also got out of his car and approached my apartment in a very aggressive manner  (I was home alone. I do not know this guy and he was griping incoherently and headed towards my apartment as I'm standing outside it with my dog. A little panicked, I told him that there was no need to approach my home and that I was ready to go. Put my dog in the house and went with him.) -I mentioned to my driver that I'd never heard of this company before and he asked who I normally use, so I mention 端ber and he just goes off. Completely bashing 端ber telling me I will die or get raped (um..?) if I continue to use their service. He also mentions how it's stupid that they use GPS and that HE knew this area like the back of his hand and didn't need GPS. -My driver then almost missed a turn (lol) and when I told him about said turn, he blamed it on my faulty address (even though I'd given the same address to several 端ber drivers and they had no issues whatsoever, lol.) -The price of this ride was 15 bucks when for my uber it's normally 6.    Bottom line, replacing phone ASAP and never using this cab company again.

The food was delicious and I really dug the chill vibe! Service was excellent and everything was reasonably priced. New favorite brunch spot!
