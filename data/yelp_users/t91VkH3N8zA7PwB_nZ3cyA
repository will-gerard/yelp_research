Came here during my lunch break with 2 coworkers. We only get 30 minutes for lunch, and even though this isn't necessarily fast food, it is also not a sit down restaurant either. By the time we received all of our food, it had been 55 long minutes since we first got there (this is not an exaggeration). Now, they do have a disclaimer that customers should be patient as they are not a fast food restaurant, but we also weren't ordering lasagna that had to be prepped and baked in the back during that time. I got the sampler plate, which was essentially just a lot of lettuce and onions and a scoop of hummus. This should not have taken this long. They lost our tickets, and even after multiple attempts asking about our orders, we were ignored. Then they messed up one of the orders. Just a disaster overall. And no apology either.  The only thing that could have made up for this is if the food was out of this world amazing, but it wasn't. It was pretty good overall, but the sampler plate was not worth almost $10 (with tax). The pita was a little rough and too chewy. The rest of the food was fine. I will probably not be going back, even though some other coworkers seem to really like it and have recommended it.

The morning of this hike, I went and bought hiking shoes and boy was that a good decision!! Some people on the trail that were wearing sneakers were looking over at my friend and I saying they wished they had real hiking shoes. Don't be this person! Come prepared, as this is quite a challenging hike. It can definitely be done even if you aren't in the very best shape but you will feel the pain for days after (especially in your thighs). However, being at the top is so rewarding and beautiful that it makes the journey up worth it.  Like I said, bring the right shoes. It can be quite steep coming back down and hiking shoes really give you the necessary grip to be able to make it without kissing the ground. Being a girl, i brought gloves as it made it easier to grip onto the rocks going up and coming down as well (especially if you have a manicure or long nails). Gloves aren't a major necessity, though. Bring plenty of water (at least 2L) and snacks for energy, and I would recommend to not let your muscles cool down too much at the top or you will be suffering coming down. My legs were definitely shaking.   When you make it to the rock wall that you have to climb, know this: that is the last step till you are at the very top, and if I could do it, you can do it. I really don't think it is that bad, if you can do Camelback, then you can climb this as well. Also, plan to spend most of your day on this with driving there and back (unless you go super early).   At the bottom of the trail there are lots of picnic tables. I wish we had brought food for after the hike so we can eat while admiring the mountain we just conquered. If you want to challenge yourself and take your hiking to the next level: this is the place to do it! Good luck!

It is safe to say that this place might be the best greek food I have had outside of Greece. It is a little out of the way if you don't live or work in the deer valley area but I like it so much I am willing to drive out there just to get some. Everything is amazing and reasonably priced. They also have a little market there with some pretty amazing Mediterranean goodies. I have recommended this place to numerous other people and every single person has been beyond impressed and went back.  The chicken shawarma plate is my favorite; the chicken is unbelievably flavorful, the jasmine rice is to die for, and the sauce that comes with it is the best part. The plates come with little salads. I've also tried to gyro plate and the lamb and they have been great as well. Honestly, there aren't enough good words to describe this little place, you just have to go and check it out yourself! 10% discount code if you check in on yelp!

There are 2 main reasons pure barre is awesome and will change your life:   1. The workout itself! I used to be that girl that could never do a single pushup and was 100% convinced it was because my arms was just built weak (LOL). I now have arm muscles I never even knew existed let alone on me! 3 of my friends started doing barre after they have seen my transformation. Everyone notices! I've managed to lose those extra 5-10lbs i never could with other work outs, I'm at my high school weight now, went down from a medium to a small in pretty much everything, dropped 2 dress sizes, and a pant size, not to mention I am more toned than I have ever even dreamed of being (all in less than 3 months). And I can even have a cookie or 2 every now and then and not feel bad.This is a workout you can really stick with because you see results almost instantaneously. But you will also work hard for those thighs! Barre has also helped me get better at hiking even, as my legs are stronger than ever.   2. The girls that work there! Every single one of them is beyond amazing! They really help you find your best form, motivate you and make you feel welcome and at home. The teachers make the classes fun and enjoyable. Everyone is super friendly. You will not regret trying pure barre!

My friends and I stumbled upon this little gem thanks to yelp (the restaurant we originally wanted to go to had a 1.5 hour wait, but it was Superbowl weekend so we should have expected that), so we decided to be adventurous for our dinner. Let me start by saying the restaurant looks magically adorable from the outside and it does not disappoint when you walk in either. It is perfect for a date night, friends outing or  family dinner (basically any occasion). The hostess saw us walking up and opened the door for us which was such a pleasant surprise. Our server was also extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu and had some great advice and helped us in making our choices.  So let's get to the food! I was there with 2 other friends and we each ordered different entrees and sides so we could sample as much as possible. The little bundle of heaven we normally call bread that they brought out literally melted in my mouth, and the butter was unlike anything I have every tried - it was a little sweet and just delectable. We got MUSSELS as an appetizer and they were amazing; we especially enjoyed dipping the bread in the curry-coconut broth (it really does taste like curry-coconut, so if you are not a fan of these flavors you might not like it) I ordered the BACON BURGER, which was cooked to perfection (medium rare), but I do need to point out that the bacon was mixed with the ground beef so you couldn't really taste it. It was good, nevertheless, but if you are a huge bacon fan then don't expect it to be very bacon-y. I added the duck egg and I would most definitely recommend that!!! My friend got the DUCK BREAST and that was everything we could have hoped for it to be (my only complaint was that there wasn't more of it). Our last entree was the SAND DABS (which is a fish; the server explained it as a better version of tilapia and she was point on!), and that was very buttery and melting in your mouth, but it wasn't as flavorful as we expected it to be. As for the sides we got the KALE, which might have easily been my favorite dish of the night, it was light yet flavorful and just amazing. The ROASTED SWEET POTATOES taste exactly how you would expect them to taste (not enough bacon in my opinion, again), but the jalapenos gave it a great kick. Finally, the GRILLED DATES were extremely flavorful and sweet; you couldn't taste the prosciutto as much because the dates were too overpowering, but if you are a date lover then you will love this side. I still enjoyed it, just not as much as the other dishes. We also ordered dessert: we got the spiked BREAD PUDDING, and normally I am not a huge fan of bread pudding (I usually lean more towards chocolate-y desserts), but this has made me a fan forever, it was so fabulous and it was just the perfect end to an amazing dinner. They also have a great selection of reasonably priced wines; we ordered a bottle of Malbec and it accompanied the dinner perfectly.   Overall, I would most definitely go back and bring more people to try it out as well. I can't wait to try more of their dishes. Everything we tried was unique in its own way and you can really experience new and exciting flavors here that put a twist to some more common dishes. I left a happy camper with intentions to return asap. My only small complaint is that it was a little pricey considering how small the portion sizes were. For example, my burger with the duck egg was $15 plus the side $8, which comes out to a $23 burger meal, which, as good as it was, was a little overpriced. I would still return and recommend this place to friends, and I gave it 5 stars because the food was really amazing.
