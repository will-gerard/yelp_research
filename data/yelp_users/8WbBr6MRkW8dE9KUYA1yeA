I stop here every Monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in Mexican comfort food. My wife swears by the carne asado tacos; the cheese enchiladas ring my bell. Although I phone in my order, the parking lot is always an adventure. However, the one night a young Hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurant's limited outdoor sitting area insisted I come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients.

Love supporting local businesses and I'm not a fussy eater but I've had better frozen pizzas that weren't burned. Crust was horrible and the vege toppings came from a can. I really don't understand how this place stays in business....
