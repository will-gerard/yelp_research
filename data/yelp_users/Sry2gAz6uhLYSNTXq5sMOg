So this place is one of the few places in town where I'd refer people to go if they wanted to get a Chicago style pizza. It's freaking delicious! On this particular visit, I had a monster salad and my daughter had a spicy pasta. Service was great as we started out on the patio and moved inside where our server helped us get situated (I forgot about my daughter's fear of birds...IDK...don't ask me??).  Wasn't able to tackle the whole salad so I packed it up to go and then made plans for my follow up visit to get my cheat meal pizza later that week. The atmosphere is great and the staff is usually more than friendly and upbeat.   Ya'll need more locations in town though...just sayin! ;)

Worst dining experience in years! So upon arrival, there is a line outside so I ask my wife to get down and see what the wait is. She comes back out and says 15-20 minutes. Okay, park the truck and wait. 45-50 minutes later I'm asking the host & hostess what happened to the 15-20 minute time that we were quoted, "well there was this party of 16 that is just finishing up so..." I then let him know that if that was the case, why didn't he communicate that with us. So then he says it'll be just 5 more minutes and it was when we were seated in a dirty area. Our server brought us our drinks, but there was no silverware to stir our coffee. After we get silverware, then we fail to see our server again for a while. Running out of coffee and creamer, now we're without beverages while we wait for the food. The food comes out, but 2 people are missing their meals. 15 minutes go by before they get their food, both children, so that made them feel all warm and fuzzy. Oh yeah, ran out of coffee again. The children's food make it out and our server says that he'll take those off of the bill. When the bill arrives, he took off the least expensive meal (not the 2 that failed to show up on time), and charged us for an extra orange juice. I ask for the manager at this point and let him know that I've just had the worst dining experience in years. He apologizes and asks how he can make it right, to which I reply, do whatever is within your power. He discounted the ticket 25%. We lost over 2 hours of our day and more considering this is one of three feedbacks that I will be providing. The server said he knows the next experience will be better. There probably won't be another experience there, but I would hope that if there was one that it couldn't get much worse than that.

I've been hitting up this spot since way back when. This is the first time I've reviewed it though. The staff that took care of me back when I first started coming here is the same staff that helped me the last time that I was in here. Athenian chicken is soooo good! The bread has great flavor and toasted just right. The inside always seems a bit smoky when I go which causes my eyes to tear up a little, but the smell is great, the food is good, and the people are nice. They do sell beer and wine here so have a glass or bottle while you enjoy your specialty sub.

I contacted this office after not hearing back from a different chiropractic office that I had visited prior when I called to check on insurance. I was able to get everything verified within 15 minutes over the phone and scheduled for next day care. Upon arriving I met Dr. Haggard and was impressed with how personable he was. We talked for a bit, took x-rays, and then got right to work on treatment. I received a follow up call the next day asking how I was feeling by Dr. Haggard himself and followed up today for my next treatment. We reviewed the final x-rays and then came up with a plan for correction.  All in all I've been more than pleased with the treatment, follow through, and personalities at Haggard Chiropractic. They've done an excellent job of making themselves stick out from their competition in the chiro industry.

Here's why they get the 4 star instead of the average 3...the kids. My kids love coming here. I'm not sure if it's the cups, crayons, breadsticks, or what, but they love it here. I have to admit that I really like the stuffed chicken marsala and the salad and breadsticks always hit the spot. This location had burned down back in the day and they renovated it when they rebuilt it to the way it is now. I like it. Would come back as we almost always get an engaging server who gives us good service.

This is a place that I frequent for pizza. They're a NY style pizza joint pretty close to where I live. They usually have specials going on for pizza, wings, and soda (not pop because this right hurrr is Arizona). Staff is friendly and we've never had a service problem. Majority of the time we'll carry out and take it home, but sometimes we stay and dine there. I haven't had dessert here, but will try to indulge after I drop some more lbs. There's one other NY style pizza place that I hit up regularly in town. My kids love their pizza.

So we came here to exchange a gift that was given to my wife for Christmas that didn't fit. After walking in and seeing the long lines downstairs, we decided to go upstairs to a "customer service/sales associate". The gentleman that we were dealing with kept trying to get us to go downstairs to another associate and it took quite a bit of attitude to push him to the point to do his job. Pretty annoying actually. Just try to help us to the best of your ability...and, if we have to wait because you need to call a supervisor to assist us, we'd be glad to. Pawning us off to somebody else even though you can take care of us isn't the experience that we were looking for.

I've been a doing business with Biker's Edge since 2006 or 2007. I watched some downhill videos on YouTube and got all worked up to start biking and started doing homework on what kind of bike I wanted and then worked from that to a retailer and BAM...Biker's Edge and me came together like lamb and tuna fish! When you purchase a bike here they do free tune-ups as long as you own it. In addition to that, if you buy a MTB (mountain bike) and take it off road, you're gonna break some stuff. They're reasonably priced and have a pretty good turnaround time to get your bike back to you. Great example is this last visit. I was almost done with my run and ended up going over my handlebars and bent my front rim. They had the bike back to me and functional quick. In addition to selling parts and bike services, they are also a Park Tools retailer so you can purchase quality bike tools here if you're a do-it-yourselfer. I'd buy another bike from them and let them work on my stuff any day of the week. Same owners since I first went in so you can get to know the staff and they don't cycle through employees like crazy.

So the skinny on the 2 star review. Target itself is clean, has quality merchandise, price isn't outrageous, but the thing that moves them from 'A-OK' to 'I've experienced better' is the fact that they ran a promo during the holidays where if you spent a certain dollar amount then you'd get a coupon for a future visit where you save 25% off of your total purchase. Well the cashier failed to give us that so we called and let them know what had happened and the customer service rep told me that they'd put a coupon aside and we could pick it up with the receipt as proof of the qualifying purchase. When we returned, there was no coupon waiting and the staff looked at us like we had 3 heads and then gave us this response, "We don't have anymore coupons here. We don't know who you talked to and there's nothing here. How would we know that we didn't give you one in the first place?" This type of poor service is amazing to me. If a representative from your company tells me that something is going to be done, then I expect to be able to come in, problem free, and complete the transaction as planned via phone or whatever. If there is no intention on setting aside something, I don't want to make a trip to your place of business just to be greeted with confusion and skepticism.

So here's the skinny on Costco...it's amazing! Love their prices and selection. The best part is their policy on quality. If you have a problem with any merchandise that you purchase there, they'll take care of you. One of the only problems with this place is it is hard to get out of this place under $100. Most every item is close to $10 so 9-10 items puts you pretty close to that point and usually you see a deal that is just too good to pass up. If you're trying to get in and out under that amount, you better go into that place mission oriented. I've purchased tires with Costco and had a great experience. I always buy gas at Costco since it's usually lower than the other fuel stations and they moved the quality up to top-tier. All in all it's a great place to do business and I love the company as a whole from the CEO on down. Nothing but great things to say about them. The Costco Business Center is awesome too over on Indian School and 33rd Ave. Check them out if you've never been there.  NOTE!!! THEY TAKE CASH, DEBIT CARD, AND AMEX AS THE ONLY CREDIT CARD. THEY DO NOT TAKE ANY OTHER CREDIT CARDS!

Found this place thanks to other Yelpers who said that it was a good spot to eat. It's a very small place, but the food quality was AMAZING! I got a chicken panini, my wife got a turkey club (which we shared with one another) and the kids got a chicken quesadilla. Had I known that I'd have been hitting up a non-franchize coffee house I'd have skipped the morning coffee and gotten it there. If their coffee is as good as their food, Wow! Customer service was great and everybody there had a big smile on their face. The only thing that could be a problem is parking if they're busy. Few spaces and the inside was small as well. Well worth it though!

UPDATE: While my rating is still low, I gave an extra star due to the fact that I was contacted by the business owner who accepted responsibility instead of making excuses. I've had a better experience at this location a year or two back and may have run into a glitch this go around.  I may be big on customer service and proper follow up, but it is what it is. If I'm told that I'm going to be contacted back after my insurance is verified so that I can schedule an appointment for treatment, then I'd like to be contacted. This didn't happen when I contacted the office. I heard back from one of the owners right away, but when it came down to the staff following up on coverage, the ball got dropped big time. I contacted a different chiro office, was verified within 15 minutes, and scheduled and have been treated twice already. My wife is also scheduled to be treated this week. Maybe if I'd have walked in and stood there I would have gotten better service, but who knows?

QTs around town are a great place to stop. They have great prices and great quality gasoline. Many of the locations now have an in-store kitchen that you can order small entrées from. The hot dog stations are so good because they have all of the sides to make a Chi-style dog (with the exception of the spear pickle)...and yes they have the neon green relish. Good selection of coffee, soft drinks, and frozen concoctions.

Loved my visit here!  Came with a close friend of mine who frequents this place as he lives nearby. We arrived and he gave me the scoop on how delicious their baked goods are and his personal favorite lunch menu item. We split a roasted turkey sandwich and a cream cheese brownie. Oh my goodness! Sandwich had amazing flavor and the brownie was baked to perfection. This place isn't close to where I live, but if I'm in the area I'll definitely be coming back to try some other menu items. Kudos to the workers at Bertha's for the smiles, great tasting food, and great service while we were there. :) The prices were just as good as the food too which was a huge plus.

I've always like Dunkin. The 'Old Fashion' is my favorite donut. The reason that This particular place is getting a 4 star over a 3 star is because I had an issue with a thermos style cup that we bought for my wife. I had taken it back and got a bit of a runaround so I emailed corporate and was contacted by the store manager. I explained what happened to her and the next time I was in the area, the manager had a replacement thermos style cup, of a different style because the one we had was no longer available, waiting for me. While it was a bit of an inconvenience to have to go the route that I did, my issue was resolved.

Saw that this place had good reviews so I checked it out after hiking the Holbert Trail over at South Mountain. Similar to other fish & chip locations in town, but quality of shrimp was really good and everything was hot and fresh. Great taste! Would return here no problem. It's easy to drive by this place so keep an eye out for it if you're looking. It's on the west side of the road.

The only thing that would get this place a higher grade would be no charge at the gate to get in. The trails are well maintained and you can bike, hike, camp, play, BBQ, hangout or whatever here. Love the outdoors! The park service does a great job, but you can't beat free. I've been thinking about an annual pass, but it's $85 for the year. The one positive from that is that it starts the day you purchase it and you get 365 days from that day.

I have been coming to this place regularly for over a year now and the quality remains outstanding with phenomenal customer service. They have a huge selection of bottled soda and offer discounts for checking in on facebook. Well worth your business and better by far than any of your franchise burger joints.

Tortas!!! This place has bomb tortas. I usually go with chicken since I like the leaner meats, but I've tried a few other styles and they're all good. They also have fresh beverages with fruit, horchata, and various sodas.

Gotta love In-N-Out! I first had them in CA before they were located in AZ. I've seen them out in NV as well when I was in Las Vegas. My go to burger is the Double Double Animal Style. You can Google the secret menu for this place and start experimenting with it. Lately I've been getting a Cheeseburger Animal & Protein Style. I'm not big on the fries animal style, but to each their own. The shakes are good too. Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry are the shake flavors. Fries are made from potatoes that are peeled, cut fresh, and fried right before they serve them to you. Delicious! I'm not sure if they still put a scripture verse on the bottom of the cups and fries containers, but they used to do that and I liked it. Hopefully they still do. Friendly staff...probably because the company pays their employees well and invests time and money to properly train their employees.

I do the bulk of my grocery shopping here at this location. Produce here is great and the deals that they have are good as well. I know Walmart says that they have better deals, but I think Fry's has better quality for a comparable price. Not worth saving a couple of dollars for a lower quality of goods. Granted canned and boxed would be the same I don't want to be making 2 trips to get my weekly goods. Love my staff here. Friendly faces and everybody is always willing to help and answer questions when you have them. Talk to the employees stocking produce and they'll usually be able to tell you how to pick the best of each item. Baked goods are made daily and always fresh. They don't have a problem taking back items if you buy them and they go bad immediately. All in all I'm satisfied and will continue to shop here.

Late dinner off of my diet (UGH!), but nonetheless we came for dinner while we were at the hospital across the street. I figured since I was venturing off of my diet that I'd go ahead and get a beer. Bianca helped us out. They had a DJ spinning some older rap joints and several TVs on playing games and ESPN coverage. There's an in-house bar and it seems as though they turn this pizza joint into a mini-club during later hours. While I was there I got the Pizza Blanco which came with white sauce, spinach, tomatoes and a white cheese. In addition to the pizza we got the Honey Hot wings and I washed it down with the rocky mountain freshness...Coors Light. Would have preferred a Kilt Lifter, but figured I'd at least keep it to a light beer. Had a good experience. Food was made fast and tasted great. I'd return here for sure to try out a different pie that they have and a different flavor of wings.

This isn't my local Fry's, but they were laid out identical to the one I frequent. The cashier was super friendly and that is always a plus plus for me. I'd return here for things needed if I was in the area.

First time here and enjoyed it. Nice spot to get a taste of Chi city way out west. They have dogs, Italian beef, and then some other eats for those who may not want to partake. Looks like they cater also.

Had an amazing experience with G&R personally at my wedding and have been to other events that they have DJed. Let me talk about my experience with them serving me first and then I'll talk about how I've enjoyed being at other events to those who I've referred them to.  Firstly, dealing with both Gabe and Robert is extremely professional throughout the entire process.  They take the time to listen to you and make suggestions without overriding your desire for your event. They're attentive and accommodating with every aspect of the entertainment part of the event. We had wanted a dance floor, but didn't have a ton of space, but they made it happen. Lights, excellent music that had everybody dancing throughout the entire reception, and the gift of speaking on the mic the perfect amount of time. My wedding reception was one that I wouldn't forget anyway, but Gabe and Robert made it that much more memorable.   As far as the other events that I've gone to where they've provided the entertainment, amazing as well. I went to a halloween party that they were featured at and they pulled out all kinds of tricks. Fog machine, lights, strobes, music fit the theme and they even were able to set up a projection screen  for the UFC fight that was featured that night. That was a huge plus because a ton of people wanted to go to the party, but didn't want to miss the fight, so this was the cherry on top. Their services are second to none as far as I'm concerned. I've been to events where other DJs are MCing the night and it always seems a bit awkward or they don't have enough equipment to handle the venue or the music is repetitive. Maybe I've just been spoiled with phenomenal service from the get go so most others fall way short of the bar set so high.  If you want somebody reliable, attentive, and willing to go the extra mile to make your event extra special...give them a call.

This is a newly established barber shop. Tony took care of me and took his time with me. There's Tony, Luis and Nancy that clip here. All of them had nice cuts while I was there. The only reason that they're at a 4 right now and not a 5 is because it's just the 3 of them so you may be waiting a while while to get your a$$ in the seat. Outside of that there's no problem with skill or courteousness. Would hit 'em up in a heartbeat down the road. I know most people stick with who they go to on a regular basis, but if you're in the area and traveling to your barber...stop in and let them fade you up. You'll be happy.
