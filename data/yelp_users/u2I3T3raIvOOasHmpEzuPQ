Took care of me even though I didn't give them much to go on.  I appreciate the patience every time I'm here.

Food is pretty good.  Service is totally fine.

Service was fine and some of the food was ok, but my chicken was bone dry and they got a to-go order wrong.  We ordered a cheese pizza to go for a co-worker that is vegetarian but the pizza had pepperoni on it.  I tried that pizza later and it was really mediocre pizza.
