My first time joining a yoga studio (I only signed up for a month, which was discounted because it was my first time at Inner Vision). I had a positive experience with Inner Vision: everyone was extremely friendly and helpful since it was my first time doing yoga. I will say I'm not sure what exactly to look for in a studio, but it was clean and the instructors were oozing positive energy :-). The only reason I didn't renew my membership is because of the cost!

Best soup and sandwich chain that I've tried in Arizona. I'm in love with the potato cream cheese soup and pretty much all the salads! And I can never just walk past the pastry display, especially with those colorfully-iced cupcakes. Can't think of anything that I can complain about!

The best place to get pierced in the valley! Everyone that works here has such an awesome personality, they totally know what they're doing, and they make you feel comfortable throughout the entire process. Shout out to Kevin who pierced my conch and double helix and Kat for doing an awesome job with my septum. The only thing I can complain about are the long lines, but that just proves they're doing g something right!

Went to Joe's Farm Grill for the first time today after numerous recommendations and I have to say, I was very pleased! Ordered the Farm Burger, Fries, and a Strawberry Lemonade, all to share between me and my mom which proved to be more than enough food. To my surprise, instead of fries which usually come complimentary with the burger, we received onion rings and I wasn't about to complain (onion rings are an additional $2.50 with a burger). To be completely honest,  there was nothing extraordinary about the burger. It came with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pickle on the side. It was a good burger, satisfying and filling, but nothing more. The onion rings on the other hand stood out and were none like I've had: extremely hott and fresh, not too oily, and the onion was plump and juicy, none of that half withered crap. The best part of the meal was definitely the strawberry lemonade! It had a perfect balance of lemon and strawberry and tasted so fresh. On top of that,  it wasn't too sweet and was large enough for two people to share. I'd recommend Joe's to anyone in Arizona looking for a decent burger, cool location, family-friendly dining experience, and delicious drinks!!

Delicious! I love the dessert crepes, I could probably eat all of them in one sitting. Today I ordered the Strawberry Nutella crepe and it is to die for. Just the right amount of cream, nutella, and strawberries to make the crepe a delicious treat instead of a sugar overload. I will say that the service is not the best. The lady who served us (I'm pretty sure the restaurant owner) was not friendly towards my table at all and no one greeted us as we came in or left.

Everything on the menu is pretty decent! It's pretty clean inside as far as I could tell. Ordered the House Pho'nomenal (P1) as well as the spring rolls and I didn't have to wait long for either. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good pho or Viet food. I will say that the service is avergae, maybe even below average, and the atmosphere inside the restaurant is nothing special.

Very beautiful and scenic at night. Not a lot of people make for a peaceful and relaxing walk. The lakeside trail is short (finished one lap under 10 minutes) so if you are looking for a place to jog, I'd recommend Tumbleweed instead. Still, check it out  !!

After enjoying cheaper ice cream sandwhiches at Diddy Reese for 4 years, I guess the disappointment with slickables was only inevitable. Paid $2 for an ice cream sandwhich, which in my opinion is overpriced considering the taste. The cookies were disgustingly sweet (ordered red velvet which tasted nothing like red velvet and mint chocolate which had no hint of mint) and the ice cream tasted like dreyers ice cream... I would recommend making your own ice cream sandwhiches at home for a cheaper and tastier alternative!

I just started attending the Arizona International Buddhist Meditation Center after a friend recommended I come with him. Meetings are Wednesday nights at 7pm on Temple Street (the center may be difficult to find as it is located in a residential house). There is parking available in front the house as well as a church parking lot across the street.   Cushions are provided for your comfort and the meditation session lasts about 45 minutes. Shane will ring a bell and talk you through the first 5 to 10 minutes. Afterwards, silence commences and you try not to think of anything at all. Once the meditation session ends, Shane leads a short discussion session to allow for questions and for the resident monk to read a prayer aloud.  I feel relaxed and at peace when I come here. Everyone is kind and welcoming, no judgement! If you are looking for a group environment and friendly community to meditate with, this is the perfect spot in Arizona!

Really missing California right now and Snoh is helping me get my Blockheads fix in Arizona. Got the taro and green tea shaved ice with mochi, red bean, and condensed milk. Pretty good, not overly sweet, however there was a bit too much condensed milk for my liking. It made the ice hard to pick up cause of the sticky goo.

Interior is terrible... the fish tank looked disgusting and the little turtle pond was creepy. I called in and placed an order for my friend and I and was told to come in 20 minutes to pick up the food. 20 minutes later I arrive and tell the server that I called in an order. She then asks what I ordered, writes it down on paper, and tells me it's going to be another 15 minutes...... literally four other customers inside the dingy restaurant. I would recommend any other pho place above this restaurant. Seriously.

Terrible and unprofessional. I got my hair dyed here after reading only good reviews on yelp. I don't understand how I am the only client on yelp complaining...  While Alex was dying my hair, he spilled drops of hair dye and chemicals all over my clothes, face, and arms. After I told him this, he took a dirty rag and cleaned it off of me... not very professional. I realized he never covered my entire body with one of those robes that salons usually put on you when they dye or cut your hair. WhenI finally got out of the salon and back home, I noticed the back of my sweater was completely stained with the hair dye!! On top of it all, my hair is unevenly dyed and looks unhealthy. I would not recommend this place to anyone, it's not even cheap.
