Great food and a welcoming atmosphere. The portions are big, enough to take home left overs. I recommend their onion rings and sweet potato fries. Their burgers are huge, but I'm not complaining    The only down fall are the flies that roam around the restaurant. The company really needs to control that problem because getting them away takes a lot of work and ruins the dinner for most people.

This is my to go place for sushi. Although they raised their prices for all you can eat, there are no limitations that comes with it! Their deep fried and special rolls are tasty and savoring. The nigiri rolls are good but I could tell that the ahi was previously frozen and not as fresh as I wanted it to me. Believe me, I'm from hawaii and I know what fresh fish looks and tastes like.  Most of the workers are Japanese. They are very welcoming and the chefs at the bar are really funny. However, we did have a server name Brian than was really passive aggressive to our group. Be careful if you have him as a server, he might add a smart/witty remark about your order.   Overall I rate them a 4 because of the environment and authenticity. It's really hard to find a japanese restaurant that has japanese people as owners.

My roommate and I went there for dinner and the service was awful! There were still nut shells in the bucket and all over the floor! The hostess obviously did not seat us on a clean section! Did I also mention it was my first time? The server did not even care to mention, the specials! Seriously the worst place ever.

I had to give this place a second chance. It wasn't a really clean experience but the food here is great! The workers are really nice and friendly. Wait wasn't that long.   I will be back to this restaurant.

I've been a regular for a year now. The quality of the fish is great. If you are looking for all you can eat and you are a nigiri sushi lover, this isn't the place to go. The reason being is that there are rules to ordering the sushi. There is a limit to how much sushi you can order. However, sushi sans quality and customer service is superb. This is a family owned company that has amazing food. If you love sushi rolls that are baked and everything else in between, CHECK THEM OUT! I recommend it!

Let me just start by saying, I am a regular here and will not come back after the service I've just experienced.   Went to Sushi San to show a friend how great this place was and instead... The owner questioned me RUDELY about ordering the all you can eat option. She scolded us for not telling them verbally that we wanted all you can eat, when we clearly ordered from the all you can eat form... (There's two different papers to fill). When I mean scolded, that included her giving us an attitude, rude tone, and being unapologetic. How are you as a customer supposed to react? Especially being a loyal customer? On top of that, they didn't honor our choice for AYCE sushi, and charged us for each plate.... The bill was then corrected but point is... It was a really bad experience.   The food was awesome. It will always be awesome, but the service here is terrible. They're rude and always question you about your order. They seem to get mad and irritable when you order a lot as well. They are even rude on the phone, so this is a fair warning.

Tried this place for the first time and it was AMAZING! Everything is priced below $10. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the delicious food! Big portions too!
