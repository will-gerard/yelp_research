First time visit and we picked a Saturday night with no pro sports downtown, knowing it wouldn't be crowded. Service from Olivia was excellent; she kept our beverages filled and otherwise checked back often without being intrusive. Food arrived much faster than anticipated, likely because it was not a full house . . . Jared Dudley's chicken sandwich with a side salad was very tasty . . . Decided to splurge and get dessert, and the brownie sundae is highly recommended! The vanilla ice cream underneath the brownie, chocolate sauce and whipped cream is both excellent tasting and amply supplied. . . . Another great feature is that a discount card is available for the asking, which gets you 15% off your total food & beverage. Overall, a great experience!

Consistently good food at reasonable prices. I'd rate the pizza above average, but not great. Lunch specials are a good value, and they are available if you ask for them all day long. Relaxing atmosphere, as long as it's not crowded. (Note: Lunch specials are no longer offered all day, which lessens the appeal of this restaurant, in my opinion.)

I've dealt with this company a number of times now, and have always been highly pleased with both the work performed and the overall experience. Reliable . . . trustworthy . . . ethical . . . reasonable pricing . . . these come to mind when I think of CLW, and I give them my highest recommendation. Since they are a small business, response time may not be as quick as the "big boys," but you will not be disappointed when giving CLW a chance to earn your business.

Auto repair can be tricky business. Not so with Advanced Auto, where I have been going for seven years without a single negative experience. Honesty, integrity and guaranteed work are the hallmarks of this business (every location is great; I've dealt with multiple stores in Phoenix & Flagstaff). They will not try to sell you more than is needed. I also appreciate that they tell you up front they may not be the least expensive option; their promise is to do their work well and stand behind it. That being said, I believe their pricing is very fair. Take the stress out of your next auto repair experience and see Steve and Michael, who will put your mind at ease while servicing your vehicle.

I'm positively inclined towards Starbucks, so that must be factored into any review I submit concerning their stores. . . . Like many Starbucks locations, this one has its strengths and weaknesses. I like the interior and there is also outdoor seating on the east side of the store and a few tables outside the main entrance (facing north). This is a Reserve store, which is another plus when I'm in the mood for something off the beaten path. There is no drive-thru, which is not an issue for me. The staff is generally friendly, though my overall impression is that I find more friendly partners at other locations I frequent in the Valley.

Really good staff here. They treat their regular customers as friends, as is the Starbucks way. If the indoor decor is ever updated, that will be a plus.

Outstanding location with ample seating both inside and out . . . Yet, the best part of the equation is the staff here . . . I've interacted with numerous staff during the handful of visits I've made in the past couple of months, and each has been friendly, professional and prompt. Management has certainly highlighted these as values, and it shows . . . CBTL iced coffee is welcome alternative to my regular coffee haunts . . . Products higher in cost than competitors and they offer no loyalty program, which are the only aspects that could be improved . . . Highly recommended!

Surprisingly relaxing find next to one of the former Blockbuster locations. Very attentive and friendly staff, and service is generally spot on. You could miss this one if you don't know where to look, but it's worth checking out.

Garbage pizza was great, as always. My kids also liked the wings. Appetizer didn't arrive until after our dinner, but they did not charge us for it, which was appropriate. Salad a disappointment, but all other food items very good. Our server, Mariana, was excellent. She had a kind disposition and checked with us often enough without being intrusive.  She kept our drinks filled throughout the evening.

Overall, the experience was positive, although I would give it 3.5 stars if that were an option. The wait at this location is ALWAYS lengthy, and the food is not so good that it feels worthwhile. The hostess team on 11-29-14 seemed particularly ill-prepared to seat people efficiently, and they were thoroughly confused when our name was called.  Our table for two was ready. . . . but it really wasn't. . . . After more waiting, we were offered a table outside (which is precisely what we asked not to have); we took it because we were hungry. On the positive side, the manager did seem to try to please guests on a busy night, and our server was extremely pleasant and attentive. (I wish I could remember her name) The pizza was very tasty, and our salad was also good.  Beverages were refilled promptly throughout the evening. The bread leaves a lot to be desired; far below the offerings of other mid-scale Italian establishments. Again, 3 stars seems harsh, but 4 may be a bit generous in light of the wait and confusion leading up to our being seated.

Usually a wait on weekends, as was the case this evening . . . Haven't always elected to wait, but tonight we wanted to stay for football and good food.  The experience was positive, beginning with friendly staff from the host team to our server. Santa Fe Spring Rolls were a tasty appetizer (albeit a tad small). The BJ's Favorite deep dish pizza was excellent; the small pie is more than enough for one (you can even share a few bites and not leave hungry). My wife ordered the very flavorful toasted chicken pesto sandwich. The Premier Rewards program is a nice plus; simply ask your server for an application before you pay your bill.

This recently opened replacement location (just west of former store) presents a far superior experience to its predecessor. Plenty of windows and a high ceiling accentuate the light that is a plus of living in Phoenix. Far more outdoor seating than previous store, as well. Staff was very friendly and efficient. There seems to be a mix of former store staff and new partners. Tiffanie was the barista for cafe customers during my visit, and she could not have displayed a more genuinely friendly and professional spirit. I give this four stars based on all my visits to this location, thus far, but wish there was a 4.5 rating.

One of my least favorite Starbucks anywhere . . . Recently remodeled indoor seating is unattractive and crowded . . . Very few of the baristas here are friendly (there are a couple of great employees, for sure) . . . Heaven help you if you arrive in the morning when there's a line . . .

One of the few places my entire family likes . . . Good variety/reasonably priced . . . Great place to watch sports, but comfortable, relaxing atmosphere for non-sporting types, as well . . . Wings are house specialty, but good sandwiches, burgers, too . . . Owners are very community-minded, supporting several charitable causes, including local anti-human trafficking efforts.  That makes me happy to give them my business.

Took in the National Championship game here, and I like this place even more than I used to. First off, they rolled out a new, slightly reduced menu in the fall and the food is better than before the change. Not only are the entrees I've tried tastier and more consistent in terms of quality, but I've noticed the speed of service has picked up. On this latest visit, we had Keri G. as our server, and she may be the best server I've ever had. She was professional and attentive, but also extremely engaging and friendly without overdoing it. This is hands down our favorite sports grill in the area. I recommend it without hesitation.

Had to give this experience five stars! Started with friendly & helpful service from Brittany, who I assume was the shift supervisor from the impressive way she interacted with me, other customers and her co-workers throughout the 90 minutes I was there for a meeting. . . . I also like that this is a "Reserve" store, and tried the Hawaiian variety, which was excellent. . . . Because our meeting involved 8 people, we "rented" their meeting room, which can be secured for a $50 gift card purchase (which is really no cost for a Starbucks regular). . . . I don't live or work close to this location, but highly recommend it, based on this positive experience.

The food here has always been outstanding, regardless of location. One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the country . . .  The sauce is incredible and Nicole's New Favorite pizza is a must if you are in the mood for a departure from typical.  The new location is somewhat impressive, but I also miss the charm of the former, smaller spot on Glendale.

Staff is nice enough, based on approximately a half-dozen visits . . . However, service inside the store is generally on the slow side.

Small business at its best! $8 Kalua pork sandwich with side of crudit√©s worth every penny. "Fast casual," but has a nicer feel because of quality and taste of unprocessed food and extremely friendly service. Owner was on site interacting with customers. Wish I could rate 5 stars, but the setting doesn't match the other, impressive aspects of the experience. I enthusiastically recommend, however, and will return soon.
