Service is mostly good. Been there a few times, and still don't get that home feel. But, the beer is good, the service is timely, and the food is fantastic! Awesome Reuben!

Had a Reuben. Not a Reuben. Cole slaw instead of sauerkraut. Very little thousand island dressing. Marble bread, not a strong rye flavor. Corned beef was bland too. Very, very, bland. I'm from Omaha, NE., born and raised, where the Reuben was invented. I'm also Irish. This is more of what's called a Rachel Reuben, except it sticks with the slightly corned beef instead of pastrami or turkey. A Reuben should have a sour and tang, stink a bit. Disappointed. Why they ruined such a beautiful creation is beyond me.

The peeps there are great!!! The food is great!!! The feel of corp sucks which is why 4 not 5 stars. I filled out survey and that's why. Corps always outta touch...always! Same here. But, the peeps at this location feel like home, the food feels like home...not idea about the music playing which they asked in survey. Richard Dawson...I don't care what the survey says...Running Man...I'll take RD on any day. Local food taste, local peeps. They make this work. Corp stuff is easy to ignore. Hope they don't corrupt it.
