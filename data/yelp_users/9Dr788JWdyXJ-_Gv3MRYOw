Top notch wings. Came here looking for some good wings and left full and happy with money well spent.  We came on a Tuesday and it was packed.  It would seem $0.55 wings really brings people to the yard. We started off with some yummy loaded fries that his the pre meal spot that was just the perfect thing to start the night.. Then the wings which were delish. With flavors like Strawberry and Buffalo, it was a taste medley in my mouth.  So many things on the menu we shall return to try other things this yummy spot has to offer.

Great burger joint. Not a high class place more like a real low key burger place that cooks your burger in front of you with yummy sides. Has a condiment bar as well.

Just a bad time. We came in expecting the name Long Wongs. We did not find it. Took us five minutes of standing in the front to figure out where to order. Them we placed our two orders of wings for $20 plus drinks and waited. For a bar was pretty run down and the table was dusty.     We waited a little while considering we were the only ones ordering food. Them they came in small fries baskets lined with foil. Inside were these small little babe wings  that had like a half a bite per wing. I only wish I took a pic. Through the whole meal never saw out waiter or bartender.     We are our wings and left in a hurry never to return.    Moral of the meal: Not all long Wongs are created the same.

Food was ok. Some dishes were good. And some were dry like it was sitting there for awhile. Some food was bland, no flavoring. There were good dishes but hard to find. Desserts were store bought or out of a can.  They make the sushi fresh but looks like its been sitting there for awhile.  Overall not worth $25.

Not good at all. I heard from a co worker that they had good pizza and as a nyc boy I had to try it. The only the thing they got right was the size of the slice but that's it. We tried to order the Greek fries and the lady said they didn't have lemon juice and couldn't make them and before I could ask for them without it she snapped just fries. A little rude but it's all good. I just wanted food. So I ordered two cheese slices and my friend got pepperoni and sausage.    It came out hot and fresh but also the crust was a little dark.  I folded my slice and prepared to consume some great pizza. But as I took a bite from that slice it literally broke on half and the cheese slid off. Not very good. Me and my friend both agreed we could barely taste the sauce cause it was very bland. The pizza had no taste and was too greasy. I love a little grease like the next guy but this was dripping down my hand into the plate when i was eating it. I ordered two slices but only ate them because I didn't eat dinner.  My friend didn't even finish his slices.  Skip this place. While the place looked nice and was cool the food was not. Try Venezia's instead on mill. Such better pizza and service. They should lose the NY in there name cause that was not NY pizza.

Now I start this review with I am a New York City guy that's loves Nyc pizza to death. But to be number 1 you need a number 2 and beyond. This place brings Chicago pizza to number 2. It was so good. The cheese way gooey and yummy. The crust was buttery and light the way a crust is supposed to be. I can see why my friends said this was the place to go for real Chicago pizza. And the app plate was delish with fried cheese cubes were yummy and they don't skimp on the dips with real buttermilk ranch.  The owner was super nice and chatted up all the people waiting for tables. The wait was 20 mins but so worth it and they text you when your table is ready and even an app shows you your place in line. The waiter was super nice and the staff are very friendly and great with their tips on good food.  Overall a great place to have pizza and get your deep dish fix with. Also the back corner booth is great for people watching. You can see the whole place.
