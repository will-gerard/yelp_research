I Have Nothing Bit God Things To Say About Them !!  This is the second time I've bought a car from them at an amazing price.  I compared prices and checked many other dealerships. It was fast and smooth. The guy who helped me was named Lamont Allen and he's a really nice guy and doesn't pressure you at all. I highly recommend asking for him. My name is Keith and I bought a Honda si. Let them know I sent ya in if you go.  I will be back .

Tried to come in for my free oil change and the guys at counter have huge attitude.   Telling me how things are done and car operates and not listening to what I know already.  This is the second time I've gotten shit from these guys. When I came I  before to get a dealer sticker removed that said mitsubishi on my Honda car the guy acted like I was bothering him and wanted to fight not to mention he scraped the paint.     I'd also like to say I have gotten 10 emails to use the service depot and also 4-5 calls with offers.  I'm very disappointed in this place.

The lake itself is great minus the really bad parking etc.  Millions of signs to be fined if you don't have a Tonto pass but they don't sell them within 20 Miles of lake.  Butcher Jones has many cool trails but it's filled with city people with attitudes and don't  know how to let people by or be friendly with a wave etc.  The beaches were beautiful way back but when we got there we saw fire pits everywhere across the beach area and nails .  Holy crap nails and glass so much so you need work boots to walk on the beach area.  Kinda sad cause it's all the street trash coming out there destroying the area.   I'd love to bring my dort bike out there and see more of the back trails along the lake.  We saw wild horses and that's the best thing about the lakes and river out here.  Actually seeing wild life etc.    If your on a boat it's much better to visit . The back beach is fun and can be wild or really boring any day of the week.

Im a fair person and like the ride now in chandler but the one in apache junction is bad.  First ive been there 3 times.  the first i couldnt even get someone to help me so i left. 2nd they were rude when i asked simple questions like what plug works in my quad and if they had any.  3rd time i brought my girl and they were real short with us and acted like we were bothering them.  i saw a old guy looking at a bike and he was ignored when he tried to ask questions.  The manager talks to everyone the way fake people talk in that weird voice and its a one way conversation.  needless to say the place is kinda  dump and has no product and the people working there dont impress.  bunch of hicks and no communication skills at all..

This company was amazing doing follow ups and getting information on the part that had been broken from the distributor and the vendor. Brett was our tech and he was very professional and did and amazing job.  Thank you so much Keith V.
