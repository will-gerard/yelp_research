As part of my hard cider tour of Phoenix it was inevitable that I would end up at the George and Dragon.   Our visit was on a Sunday, mid afternoon, so I'm basically reviewing the food  and not the whole UK pub experience which I usually rate poorly having escaped the bloody country in the first place:) E.g this is 15 plus years of eating 2-3 times a week in bars as the yardstick I'm taking a swing with.    Firstly the good parts.  Their spicy wings, boy do they deliver.  It's  at minimum a heavy vinegar / buffalo sauce   , thai chilis? and enough of the seeds to make my wife's nostrils clear from accross the table.  Boy these where nicely done, full and a fricking bargain. For this and the cider alone  I'm returning.   Then the meal.  I had an awful hankering for offal but alas the steak and kidney pie was mispelled and I ended up with a steak and kidney piece.  There are so few places that do this dish and seemingly none that do this well. Ok I can do without  large lumps of kidney  but  not without the taste. This thing was thick and herby to the point that  calling a  thyme out would have been useful. This took the 4 to a 3.    WIfey's yorkshire pudding was burned ( not that hard admittedly) but  the roast beef  didn't appear to have been roasted, least on site. It's like Birds Eye boil in the bag roast beef simmered in gravy.There was zero indication the outer surface had been  exposed to dry heat of anykind  and we think we know where to get it :) If it's not then  they really suck at roast beef.  That and it didn't come with the horseradish on the menu.   Service, pleasant but kinda slow .For the food  2.5  rounded down to 2 because It's really not OK  to have two main dishes fall so far short of pub food.

EXEC Summary:   +Wasted our time with childish obfuscation of the sales price +Disregarded our ceiling for buying a vehicle +Changed terms of finance and what it would take to qualify  Yeah I know sounds like most any used car sales operation in Phoenix. :)  This is a review of the used car sales process and while the staff insist that we must have somehow misunderstood them I don't think that. We went to look at a car, tested it,and left. We liked it enough to discuss terms  the day after and  that's where the fun started. We had simple needs. Tell us the car price + tax, fees and registration.  That's it we didn't want a warranty or many of the other add ons that they try to foist on you.  They made an offer, we declined  as it was above our stated max of 10k  out the door max.   Forward a day and a call from  James called wanted us to consider it again at what they called the auction price. (Claimed car was a week away from being auctioned)   This sounded better so we found sitter for the kid,  drive down and ask for the new price. It was $200 less than previously but still above $10k, and that was that. They had taken up yet another night and this offer just plain sucked. They could have told us on the phone but no they think it's clever to waste people's money acting like a paranoid secret squirrel on a meth bender.    The usual what could we do to guarantee you'd buy it discussion occurred?  Easy  8k out the door, that's a pretty low offer,insulting? Maybe but hey once you take the piss with an offer that failed to meet our limit  and lose us a few hours of spare time then I get pissy.  They didn't even counter, just said no way, can't even get close and the poor dealer's story of how much they were in for that car etc came out.  I really thought they would break out some violins.   Next day  call about how the night guy mustn't have been informed of the "auction price" offer and really they would let us get it for  9200 out the door Yay:)  Erin went down on her own to fill out the paperwork.   ( Sidebar) I have really good credit ( there's a reason Scrooge McDuck is Scottish after all) my partner less so, ok it's poor. That's ok we expected to pay dearly for this , her first car, but 20% is just plain awful. Hell when I was new to this country I got a lower rate on a new VW bug.)  They came back over 20% and I suggested she not do this without talking first or seeing if my bank would be a better bet. After she spent  more hours at VW Camelback they wanted to run the numbers with me and her ( they still sucked being a  full 12% over the number my bank qualified me for today) but in the meantime they told her she no longer qualified at 20% , that it would have to be co signed BUT if we added an extended warranty onto it, they could call in a special favor and they could see about it. That's when we walked for the last time. I could have bought the car, cash but that defeats the  rebuilding credit goal.  Simply didn't trust them. I think the withholding of credit unless you get to the figure by adding warranties  is problematic and  coercive in a manner that I'd consider unethical given a prior indication, the reason we were even back in the dealers , that she'd been approved.   We received a call saying  "they are sorry we misunderstood"  some apology, we understand that you get so used to BS that you can't stop doing it even if you want to.   Ended the day at Superstition Honda and bought a used Civic so HA  we were serious you jack offs!   The good stuff.The sales guy, (Chigago) Joe was great, personable and  the process of showing us suitable cars, getting a decent test drive rather than the 3 rights and your back at the dealers was all pretty happy.  I don't know if you can split out the role of the sales people from the finance office but I'd hate to think they are innocent and losing sales because of the F ing I people:)

It's often amazed me that we appear to have so few hat shops for the UV intensive lifestyle we have here.  The large outdoor outfitters have a limited range, both in size and style, and ordering mail order is a great way to end up with an ill fitting hat.  All of the above is why I'm glad to have found this place.    This place has a large selection of  western(cowboy), Australian , panama, etc from many makers and reasonable prices to boot.   Not Amex friendly but they do take visa / mc.

Third dealer of the day  and  things are not so bad  yet not improving.   We've had a rented Taurus for 3 weeks and have come to appreciate that while Ford had issues they seem capable of knocking out a good car ( I mean  the ones in Europe don't all suck:) ).  Tried out the Fusion. We have  love hate relationship with the car we actually like it but hate the hell out of the central console  unless it has a nav unit covering it up:) The sync, nav console is kinda cool in function too. So  we want a  fusion with the nav package , no sunroof.    1st thing they had us drive.  the really fast one, Not the engine we wanted, but hey, try again, nope can't do that. In the end they said they don't have what we want but 6-8 weeks they could get one. Why can't we be told this at the time of our request?   We say , we'd like, you say, nope that isn't standard  not F around trying to fit us into your stock.    We've had prior issues here. Tried to buy a Ford Hybrid last year and , well they showed us non hybrid, then another , then tried to sell an Edge, seriously we asked for a car that took them a while to admit they didn't have. Could they get one? They didn't care so Honda ended up getting the business that time.    This time it was Mini. ( yep we set out to buy a big car and ended up in a small one)

Service great,  decor a step above the Valley norm and presentation make this one of the best all round Thai meals I've had in the region.   Thai hot? Sorry but Touch of Thai and The Thai house  in the north  and the north west of Phoenix respectively equal them and I had stressed me craving/ need/ addiction to experience such. I.E.,That's why I was at a Thai place to begin with since Indian eateries appear to have conceded their heat advantage to pander to local tastes.  . It tasted really good though and only decorum , and a wife that would have stabbed me for doing this, prevented me from licking out the bowl:)   The ginger dish that my partner had was very very  light in the ginger department but was pretty good otherwise and everything was as fresh as I've seen within the valley.  So is it worth a 30 mile drive on a regular basis? Not based on this single experience but it's good enough to  my Thai go to when in the region.

Boy is the name a temptation.Seriously :)  I'll try to be fair though but I'm writing at a time were this restaurant was truly life changing. So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.    Texas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.  Kid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :(   Entrees.  Cajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:)   Sirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned.   Sides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.  Fried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible:   Steak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)  1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.

Tried to avoid chains last year but people invite us to them , and, well we can't be dicks all the time. The last experience I had at a Carrabba's in Scottsdale was pretty good so  let's try the one in Glendale,  Quickly seated,  drinks, and appetizer  were great. The soup, Spicy sausage and lentil  was so good I looked up a copycat recipe for it . The goat cheese and pomodoro sauce brushcetta  had us feeling all happy and relaxed.   then   main meal arrived. Wife's meat was not medium, not even close you could get red out of it.   Neither myself of the kid had cutlery so  it took a while to get a waiter to stop to remedy this. This interval turned my veal marsala into a gelatinous mess  when cold. It tasted of flour and barely of marsala which I can make about 23 times better at home.   Wife's dish was re heated it  well done with black hightlights .Not a new meal. Now it's heavy on the grill flavor.   Spoke to manager Heather , she came to us, but I can't ask for more ( actually I told them to leave it on the check )  than they drop it.   The kids meal  was great!  but they ruined the evening , seriously a dessert ain't going to count two messed up entrees    2.5 rounded down.

Service with a meh.   Third time at this place ( it's en route from kid's hockey class) and it's been pretty much on a decline.This refers to early evening during the week.      No explanation of beer tour for the wife though maybe that's part of the entertainment? Expected from past 2 visits.   Wrong meal brought  for me based on my asking for the cordon bleu calzone ( sounds ridiculous in hindsight I admit)  yet I appeared to be pointing to the chicken milanese.   Yes I have an accent but that's a pretty big range of wrong to get to  Milanese from calzone . The former, of which I had a bite prior to realizing that there was some dough missing  was all shape, texture and no taste like they'd learned cooking from slides. Baked breaded chicken lovingly dehydrated and missing traces of  just about everything they claimed to be in the sauce.. lucky miss.   I wandered off to get the menu to check up on what had actually arrived. During this time server was debating with my wife re my actual order. I got back to my favorite type of  question.E.G., you'd like us to get you what you ordered? Thanks, yes actually I would consider that a courtesy.   1.5   starts rounded to 2.

I'm always amazed at anthropomorphism when it comes to eateries it just seems in such bad taste but  when it comes down it I voluntary  entered a pink building with metal siding  so any pretense I had re concerning aesthetics is rather lacking in credibility. Yes there are a lot of pigs just don't think about it too much while eating.  This was a quick lunch stop  2pm in the afternoon and the place was quiet.    Didn't get appetizers.  Service was quick and ordering  was easy.  Pork sandwich and a hot link sandwich.   Food came out quickly.    The BBQ beans are claimed to be  made in house but the way they make them seems  to resemble that which came out a manufacturing plant. I'm not saying they aren't made at "home"  maybe that they just shouldn't go to the effort for the result.   These were a mass disappointment and  would be my reason to exclude them from further visits.   The hot link sausage and sauce on an onion bun was  again not that bad but not going  go out my way to get it again.  Cornbread,  really good,  BBQ pork sandwich  that my partner had was pretty good.    Soda was refilled and had the syrup balance  done well. Nowhere close to RUB in Vegas,  or  even El Paso which is a shame since the price difference isn't that great and the food is average -  ouch  for the type.    I stayed in GA my first years here in the states and I have to say that  while this is Ok  for lunch if you are near it  I can't see  El Paso   knocking it out of my local bbq fix.  So my search for great BBQ in  Phoenix goes on..

We're still steady customers after three years of eating here with never a bad meal, or issue that wasn't immediately corrected.  So far the best udon base I've found in the valley, but that statement really only works if you are me.Everyone I know that's eaten the miso soup rates it above average There's a wide variety of rolls,appetizers and drinks that are reasonably priced out-with happy hour.  This is my family's favorite place as kid are treated well at any time,E.g, Sat afternoon or a Tuesday night.  as soon as I am off my  lo iodine diet this is the  second place  I'm  going. ( 1st will be breakfast:)

For a basic watch battery replacement ( very common type) they want $40. I didn't use the service as that's more expensive than me sending it back to the maker for a service.There's a stand in the same mall that can do it for $16.   While they have extended warranties  ( 5 years on battery replacement) it's about twice the going rate. Look at how many of these shops wink in and out of existence. Search on yelp had more closed than open.

I often want to shy away from criticizing companies that  mess up gluten free offerings because it's so easy for them to decide it's not worth it and remove them altogether.    That being said...    If you pay an extra $1 to have an item that will stop you from feeling like death for a few hours it would be nice if it your burger was between it. Should that part be messed up  then it wouldn't just be taken away,  swapped over, and then given back now that the meats cooled and a lot of the juices/ additions were stuck to the old bread. it's not as appetizing as it sounds.  How about offering to remake it, a new fresh burger just like the one we paid for?    The fiery Jolokia burger is nowhere near as fearsome as it should be. E.G., it's lower than a raw habanero which is not what I was looking for which is a damn same as it really tastes great  and should I ever want to blend up a burger to feed to a small child I'll keep it in mind. I'm as harsh to a company proportional to their claims of  how spicy they claim their food is.   Overall this location gets a 2, the burnt to hell coffee that came out on the first attempt should get you a 1. In their defense the "fresh" pot was nearly as acrid so it's hard to think that there's not some cost cutting on coffee occurring but most places that late in the day ask me if it's ok to wait while the make a new pot, not give you whatever's stuck to the carafe at the time

I frequent 3 ranges,   Ben Avery , Scottsdale Gun Club ( less and less) and  Shooter's world  were I have a membership.  Firstly the  policyo  re the cased guns is annoying but  it's not as annoying as the inability to draw from concealment  limiting your ability to practice anything practical.  That's during normal hours/ outwith of classes)   The AC struggles with our weather  and  targets are static.  Apart from that it's all good.  Ladies night rocks,  free rental, range time and protection on Fridays  and it's a good way to get someone you care about to take better care of themselves.   Good choice of rental  guns   but poor choice in ammo. E.g  if you rent a 44mag then  it's overkill to hunt paper  with hunting rounds.  Staff on the whole have  been great over the last five years  and if you shoot weekly the memberships are worth it  for those on the Westside. Renewals are a bargain.    Classes good with quality instruction  and while  five stars would by SW staff  at the SGC range   I think a  four is  fair  for were they are right now

They tried to kill me, and I love them for it.    When a company posts a wing challenge usually covertly by  using terms fire, insanity,suicide or death wings I have to try it.Nearly every place using those terms in the valley are liars. If it's a chain restaurant Suicide wings =  a penguin's dangly bits.   I am one of those idiots that frequents hot-sauce forums, sites and other places where my legal high can be obtained or discussed with those similarly afflicted so I took them up on the $15 challenge to eat 10 in 10 minutes, prize for 2 hours of speaking in tongues and humming a Johnny Cash tune?  Picture on wall and T-shirt plus not having to do it again:) The wings are caked in a habanero reduction that is more a  volume of heat eaten rather than insanely hot. Try it.It's awesome way to spend  20-30 minutes:D   Thankfully they have more affordable, livable, Zombie wings for those times you have enough T Shirts in your wardrobe but still need that kick. Their Hellzapoppin burger is rather good too.  Nice people,been in several times and orders have been quick, hot, correct and the food is a great value for money. 5/5  purely on heat  4/5  on food..5/5 value  So 4.7 stars rounded up:)

About three weeks back. Chicken salad 3 pieces with uncooked areas.  The rest is kinda detail. The Main office got back to us re the tweeted picture of raw chicken,the local one didn't even address it. Looked up their ratings re health and safety and it appears to be a more institutional problem  than this oversight.

quick, clean, fast   good value which gets the basics right  and beats out the place on 43rd / Cactus handily both in speed and taste.  The beans and rice aren't just required filler they're actually good accompaniments to the meal.   No frills,cash only and  not the easiest place to get in and out off ( then again neither is the new In and Out on Cactus)

I think I have found the secret power source that  fuels the awesomeness that is Captain Bill's.    Firstly this place has more bumper stickers  than a VW microbus convention, secondly  the paint scheme could be a landing light for the White Stripes  but I digress  let's get back to the power.    On the SF2 game a sticker proclaims.    "your honor student  never gets laid"  To the left of the register.   "My kid has sex with your honor student."   This sets up a reality inversion  field which  prevents much electronic equipment from working that's why they don't take credit cards (duh!)   but also seems to power the time bubble back to a prior decade. I'm really impressed and annoyed that I hadn't tried them out prior.   The two staff on today were  described , e.g not lacking in the pulchritude department,from the other  reviews  but I didn't notice a lack of CS service, nor would I expect it based on looks so wanted to kick that one out the door.     We had a cup just collapse and  a refill / mop appeared  within seconds.     Oh the food, yeah  the food is not likely to be the best sandwich you have ever tasted but  you may forget that while eating it.   Smacks the chains  silly ( all  I ask really) and offers well priced sodas,   ice chips rather than cubes and fresh main ingredients.   As unpretentious as the bumper stickers  that adorn the walls. A statement of single intent.  Feed me , fresh, cheap now:)

Arrived here with family mainly  to satiate my desire for wings as  in the past I've had ok-good experiences with their suicide wings, E.G., three different locations seemed to have differing levels of heat.    Was in Sat night, early evening. Wings didn't exactly themselves-it to the table and after 2-3 had pretty much come to the conclusion that they'd sat a while, had already been heated more than once or the oil was getting pretty fricking old..They also were not exactly  physically hot.  On floor manager seemed to take a while to register that I thought some, or all, of those had happened and , since they were suicides they had no return so I thought I'll eat them anyway ( sauce covering some of the sins of the cook)   They took em away , they reappeared really quickly (like 1/5 the time the original order took and now had so much hotsauce on them some of the wings were actually submerged ( that if meant to teach me anything was appreciated..I love heat:D    I'm pretty sure they just fired these again   My entree , never get this. Buffalo fish sliders appeared with a scratch of the sauce/ cabbage, some oil, same crap just tasted of oil , so I used some of their hotsauce to kill that too.    The kid's meal was  good and while the wife's was a pretty watery chicken pot pie it tasted good. Service was as slow from the kitchen has others suggested  and  while I would usually  do 2.5 rounded up to  3... I'm going to round down to 2.. If you pride yourself on  wings and then let anorexic, cold and oily items substitute for them then I will trade the nicer booths, wider drink choice to head to Steakenburger because their wings truly do not suck.

Ah this is a plaice  proving that  punliness is next to codliness.  Good now that the we hate pun people are gone I can  let you in on a quiet , and tasty, secret.    Yet another of those restaurants that don't show up on conventional searches, has nothing in the way of street presence yet consistently knock out great food.   Why not a  five?    Excellent question.   Tonight was surprisingly quiet around  1915  it was more Marie Celeste than Love Boat  which is  on most occasions nice but  for those that like some life  may find it unsettling.  Let's get into the food.  The chowder ( both NY and Maine) on offer was  pretty good but did hit a couple of  flour spots in it, the olive oil? on top superflous and Pappa Deuxs is still in the lead  within this five mile radius  of Metro Center.  The appetizer choice is lack lustre,  e.g  3 kinds of shellfish and cheesesticks. The latter are massive and  most sane people won't finish all six alone.     Onto the main course.  The mahi mahi , marinitated  for 24 hours, was perfect and flavorful. The sides that come with it are pretty limiting. Fries, coleslaw, baked potato, rice  or veg ( pick 2 ) and  that fish atop a nice bed of rice with an accompanying salsa would be amazing.  Fish is so good it's  making the rest  seem average in comparison.    The fish and chips  which my partner had were massive , tasted average, batter has little to no flavor but the textures nice.  It's hard to get a taste from the cod without moving it.   Wow that still gets a four?  We've eaten here prior and the service is always good, the  food is always at least good   it's just that   I'd love to have the same experience with the appetizers and sides that I do with the star(fish)  of the dinner.     The bread at the start, the garlic  butter with it is  wonderful, really  wonderful. In relation to  what I had  when I lived by Monterey,CA,  I would give this a 3.5   rounded to four.

Two stars for a two point five star place.  When the kitchen is having trouble getting the right dish out/ ingredients on the right dish there are professional ways of handling it that don't make it to the diners.  Yeah that inspires a lot of confidence.   Avocado egg rolls were great even though 2/3rd of the ingredients the sun-dried tomatoes  and onions were scarce or so finely chopped as to be a homeopathic dose.  Pad thai was underwhelming and not much of a difference between ready made stuff from the store.   Name annoyed me  as anything I'd expect to find in a restaurant named after an area would be some of the foods from that area! It's  American food in the worst sense  Big Island meat loaf?  Oh just  die already.

Big Trouble in Little Szechuan would be too harsh a review  and  it's not worthy  of a great wail but  I was totally underwhelmed by the food on offer and food wise it seriously is   a step above the mall food court  but   even a Pei Way on a good day  is more than a match for this evening's meal.   Staff are great but  everything else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good.     The spring roll, egg, hot  and sour soup and  the  kung pao all look the part but  it's all monotonous  with little variation in texture and taste.  E.g you could  make this from  Walmart  ingredients and get the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost     It's not going to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but  there's just way too many good places nearby to consider this as a repeat visit.

I'm late to the game of Hockey , and to professional sports in general, so  it came as a pleasant surprise to me that attending a game with 16000 other people  could be as painless as this. That the food choices  would be so varied (  I come  from Scotland so choices at our games were pie , or no pie )   was a nice surprise, that it costs... well  no surprise there.   They had me at the intro  show. Yep  this was the first time I'd seen a modern  stadium system up close and was  suitably impressed by the theatre,  so much I stayed for the game.  It's hard to mention this place without  suggesting that you give hockey a try  it's  really worth the $ to find out if  it works for you.    3 hours  versus lifetime of amusement ,  it's worth it:D  Traffic control is really good, and unlike BOB where  waiting for 20 mins is usual we've been  orderly  walking,  get car and out in that time. The name is silly but the era of  evocative names like  Candlestick park  and  Fenway   to be replaced by  ephemera  such as 3 com and now monster is  indicative of the times.

I started out on the suicide plate  and I'm still here.     I think I just have to accept it that I've either burned out my palette or  the general public can't tell really spicy from  a hole in the ground.  It's not a macho thing  peppers are my anti drug. :)   You get the heart racing, cold sweats  , paranoia that you're never coming down. So while this one isn't  Bava or Choco   the Panda is still good  shit.      The taste tour and instructions on filling out the menu are a very nice introduction to what one reviewer has called  a  food court fight.   I have to agree.  I came from Scotland and in the afternoon the Chinese  restaurants opened, yep  Chinese food was an evening  item. The first time I say it in a mall  at 10am I just had to have it, it just wasn't done , not very.. British:)    Neither was mixing it with an order from the Italian, I could have invented Mamma Bandidos years back:D   Keeping that history in mind I was so ready to love this place after reading the reviews. After   Pollo Diablo, Jerk rice, Jerk Chicken and the black bean plate I  will   marry this store if Prop 102 doesn't mess that up too.  I'll still cheat on her with Pizza a Metro but  I think the Italian part will understand:)  Ok the pollo diablo  was  crispy better than any buffet attempt  , or most  low to mid chinese eateries  not tough in the middle , full of garlic and  damn it's good. So good that I am glad the recipe for that is up on the Food Network site and plan to make this soon.   The rice and beans on their own are again better than I expected it.  They are doing better rice than most Mexican, better stir fry than most Chinese and better jerks than a team of Jamaican weightlifters.    In short  I don't care about the canteen feeling , the cutlery  or the  tin dishes ( hand to pop a lid on to take leftovers in ..should I ever leave any)    The sum of these parts really adds up to a greater whole in the Wall  and my smile can , I believe , be seen from space.

Part of my draught cider tour.   They have the chips down to perfection. Irony that half of the English national dish is better represented here than within any of the British bars, fish and chip places in the valley.   Truth be told chicken tikka masala is closer to being the English national dish.  The only reason  Britain had an empire was to find something decent for dinner which should have left Ireland unmolested. That's a puzzle for a later talk post.:)     The queso dip to start was fine, nothing special. Why can't we have Irish bars serving something close to what I would get in Ireland?  It's a continual source of amazement to me that  it's just whatever is popular locally with the addition of an Irish name = appetizer. Que? :)   This is the best tasting non-shepherd's pie I've had. Ok it has beef , instead of lamb,  but  finally someone that didn't deaden the dish it in gravy,  waste it with poorly mixed potatoes from a packet nor stuck in vegetables that didn't belong in there.  Just the right crispiness on the top and a portion that just has me coming in as full as the last spoon is scooped.   Cider , yay,  not a lot of choice, ok no choice:)  but it's still cold and doesn't have that fell out off the can taste.    My partner had the boxty  which was feckin great to the point that I was envious, me with my pie and all, that I couldn't be eating two plates at once. Solution? I suppose I'll have to come back.

There is a level of rudeness that we encountered here at Friday lunchtime that takes the biscuit, cake and pita bread.   I was with a party from work which had checked in with  No idea what was going through her mind but to openly question if your Q Jumping, go back in to check, then have  my friend go back in to show his licence  just for the privilege of buying   lunch  here? Hey Soup Nazi was a  fictional character not a training video!   Hard to enjoy food after such BS.  That being said the server was great, the food came out fast. The food was as good as the Pita Jungle I frequent in Arrowhead  ( with the nice staff :P )  and would easily have made it to 3.5 or 4 stars.

It saddens me to say that this isn't the worst Mexican restaurant we've eaten at, that's on Oahu near Waikiki beach, but it's close.    Damn it we had to drive by Arriba's to get to this place.     I had a chimichanga that was a little anemic, though what there was of the filling was ok,  beans  tasteless, rice looked the part but as spicy as your average UK meal involving boiled meat and root vegetables.   Erin's Fajita salad was similarly lack luster  with  all the appearance of being tasty yet   bland chicken. Usually, unless there's an attempt at "chefing" as opposed to cooking  I'll order a basic dish ( I don't shoot the chef though  and trust me these guys are safe from Agent Sands , very safe)  for the first time out  and if the beans/rice suck.. no return.  Overall It feels like aliens, space ones, are running the place and they learned cooking from pictures.  It's certainly a mistake we won't be repeating.

Looks like  solid twos are the thing here.   Was seated quickly,  order taken quickly and  first round of drinks all appeared. Going quite well.  The garlic fries  came out shortly after and  that's when it started to go from  4 stars  downwards.    Cajun Pasta :  Nothing original or subtle,    I should known better.   Monotonous taste with all the right shapes present but it's a hit of their sauce and that's all you get for the rest of the meal.    NY Steak Sandwich  Massive,  but dry. The sauce was minimal and  the lack of drinks stopped Erin from getting through more than a third of it.  Also had those wonderful garlic fries but they either need to revisit the sauce  and  perhaps trim the gristle off  come to think of it this was a lame $14  sandwich.    Coffee :  Tepid,  like it's being heated by a lamp.  Only had to suffer two of these.   Service: Started out great but  the drinks stayed dry for most of the meal. This was not on game night, rush hour  so it looked like the usual mis match of staff to customers that seems to be Phoenix area speciality in casual dining.     Mediocre   to the point that I can't even  make fun of the place   it's just not worth it.  For non beer drinkers I can't see this being a place to seek out when  their close, but tastier analog that actually has hard cider, Yard House, is within a mile away.

Decor  functional  Staff friendly and are really kind to our toddler food rocks  within my  limited range of  red and yellow curries ( so much so they suggested I try something else, hey it's not my fault these are so good that I didn't want to risk anything lesser.   Prices are a bargain for entrees,  spice is there, they really get the request to make it very very hot.   This is probably the best bargain  in North Phoenix for  spice hounds

It's been nearly  9 months  since the wife and myself ate at Quiescence on a Friday evening.  It takes an evening to really go through the experience and that's the best way to explain it because objectively this has to add up to more than the sum of it's parts.   The grounds are great and a nice transition from the orange vampire lights of Phoenix but it's likely If you ride a bike it's pretty bloody perilous to get your stand down,or to wear high heels ( Hey those Harley guys are hiding something;) )   I have a rural background, and the outside tier of Quiessence , the one just in the main entrance,really didn't hack it in terms of ambiance, it's like sitting in my UK farmhouse at night :  ( Ok that may be exactly the point they are going for but I kinda feel that we missed out by not being in the main room)    So what of the food?  I have to concur with many that have said that the natural ingredients, the  meats, cheeses , presentation and knowledge of the staff are excellent though  possibly a tad presumptive re what my next question would have been.  We cook a  lot at home but it's not possible for me to know every herb that goes on a plate I like to learn but preempting my ignorance?    The salad was probably the best one I've ever had which when considered next to my chosen second plate of Duo of Housemade "Boudin Blanc" Sausage and Slow Roasted Pork Belly with Butternut Squash "Mash" should  be a good indicator of how I rank salad in the scheme of things.Their wild foraged mushroom salad  was, well it's 9 months later and I still, recall it fondly.    We'll certainly go back but it's more of an annual event. Quiescence is  like getting your first real watch. It  kicks you off into a search for ever more interesting pieces but you still end up having a soft spot for the original.   4.25 stars if I could rate it like that.  Just a little too high on the price for what goes into the main dish. The appetizers, plate one, salad were all worth it in a way that our entrees were not. Given that we'd just had great appetizer, beginning and first plate it was anti-climactic for the entree to be ,you know, just great.  (Yeah I know ungrateful , there's people starving in the world ,we were two of them in the interim between plate 1 and 2 :) )   A small  frustration was the water. The mineral water gets up to room temperature between courses and at $9 a bottle ,a mark-up that makes me want to switch to wine next time, the Pillsbury Roan red, and  take a cab.

Initially lost on entry. CJ = hearth on the way in, it's absence made me wonder just how much damage the noon sun had wraught but nope It's just not there.   The first  server didn't know about the drinks available, no asian beers present, but specifically  was unable to get a pear cider in bottles until we'd proved it, would have been easier to have asked the bar person, oh hell she was the bar tender but I like a game of search the menu when parched. Makes the prize so much more rewarding.   Server change:)  Sabrina was great, a non corporate personality in a chain ( tis a good thing) even during my head-addled minds attempt to get through the appearance of an item on the menu being claimed to be "happy hour only" Sorry I wanted  6 wings, not 12,  hard enough to lose weight, yeah why go to Claim Jumpers then,  damn you caught me. ( I was cheating ok?)   We had a light, for CJ, meal and it all came out well cooked and on time. Drinks stayed filled.  I stopped going to these a while back because the self control  didn't match their offer I'm happy to say that they are making it a bit easier ( though not by much ) to leave without two bags of food under your arm while your spouse wheels you out to the car.

Of the three great magic acts in Vegas with a comedic element  this is the only one you can take a young child to.There's still enough humor at the adult level but it's implied in a way that will fly over the kids head.   At the back you can see about 90% of the tricks , e.g., you may have a hard time seeing a playing card or a worm but none of the routine relies  heavily on this  but seriously the upgrade cost is minimal, go for it unless you have a phobia of being picked to do a trick.   Cheap to the point of feeling guilty leaving the theater.

Is it damning with faint praise to  say it's the best restaurant of its type when there's no analog within the city?      Until now  most of my experience with the pasties, or bridies as we called a  very similar dish In Scotland, has been uniformly  bad in the USA.  E.g  every  British theme pub has one on the menu  and seem to share the  same supplier.  This was so much better than I had hoped.  That they had draft cider too was  even better , a rarity in AZ, but perfect sense given the origin of the pasty in the English  West Country. Should have been Scrumpy ,a man can dream can't he?   The complaints about them not being traditional fillings is , well, odd. There wasn't a lot of variety in the UK diet,  less so on the working class end. So   On to the food.   Everything about the decor,  waiting time and suitability for groups is true.  Staff are friendly and  frankly it's nice to be left alone   rather than constant hovering.   Onto the food. Pastry  rocks,  they've nailed it.   It supports the  contents right to the last.     Fillings I had the Lamb Vindaloo which was close, but, but missing a sharpness/ e.g  vinegar, that I usually look for but it was still really good.  Dipping sauce complements it nicely.  My wife had the banger's and mash  version with  a red wine sauce.  Again  pretty good.   So why  four stars?    Many comments here have mentioned a lack of sensitivity  with regards to the flavors/ herbs and the thyme was   way overused on the bangers/mash gravy and it's  a shame as you could taste what they were trying to get at. Additionally the price may seem like a little on the high side ( would be  daily)  but  think about what you have paid for every processed , gray meat  excuse, of a pasty  and just smile.    Worth  working your way through the menu.

More likely to have the little things you need than   Guitar Center.    Ok the fun thing about music stores now is that they have to over more than  low prices to complete with the large online sellers , e.g  customer service, availability of stock and ideally the chance to actually use  the items prior to buying.  Sam Ash so far seem far more amenable to doing this than the aforementioned center of guitars.  They have a better choice of hand held recorders, groove boxes , mics and  interface options to you mac pc ready to walk out the door.  Prices are about the same as online + tax  ( e.g your must have it now penalty )     for most of the items I looked at and the staff  , on this occasion, seemed more helpful . The prior time the guy  was unable to get the hint that  Take the  damn thing of the shelf, let me play with it and you may have a sale meant that:D    So  it's a four for now. I've never returned anything so can't speak to that.    If you buy an item  that doesn't  fit there's  30 day money back,  45 day  swap  for gear which is pretty good.      It's close enough to Guitar center to just  drive the extra  couple of miles   and for people that care about  2a  and CCW  there's not a sign that say " get bent  we don't want your money on the door:) "

Found this place a couple of years back as they were one of the few dealers in the valley that dealt with the kind of frames that I wanted. Had specific usage for them , e.g, under a bike helmet and I found the consultation knowledgeable and helpful ( not an accusation you can level at their website:) )     I picked a set that only had lenses made at the makers so it delayed getting them to me somewhat but  I was made aware of that so not a big deal.   All was happy for a few months and then the right leg started to loosen from frame,  was able to take it back get adjusted, happened again, then lens came out. Ended up sending back to maker,   all well. Then repeat, the maker Tag Heuer didn't even send back matching stems,  and then they failed again. At this point I was done at  over $800 for the set  I had more trouble and time invested than any prior glasses I'd owned.   The service Tag gives you  on the watches is not matched on the optical side, least not yet.   Not a great story but in the end working with the shop Tag replaced frames with  a new model, the store made the lenses and I'm still a happy customer. They answer their phone, return messages when they can't get to it and both stores are staffed by people that know what they are doing and when you have problems will work with you to sort them out.

Lunch service only.   I swear my fellow diners at hospital canteens look in better shape than the  mass that "meats"  for late lunch at this location. This wasn't just a grey tide but a few human buoys had popped in too.   Please withhold the " don't be so judgmental"  holier than though attitude , this is a review site  after all.     Lately I have been working remotely ( or remotely working)  on the Friday so I've been going out on Fridays for lunch since it's all "new" to me.  The same places that I eat out at  in the evening often have vastly different characters during the day and  this Black Angus throws it into sharp relief.  For example at night I have never been served stale bread.   At night they have  a wide range of ages , group sizes and noise levels  and  there's some life in the place. Chilis that just opened up nearby and seems to have kidnapped the life leaving   a quiet, genteel even , location that would be more fitting in the deep south when you don't have anything better to do. So far this is the only local place that  exceeded my hour.   Food's ok ,  fitting with the  price range and  the burgers are well appointed,   cooked to request and  relatively  tasteful.  Fries tepid and it feels like the minimum  you have to do to keep the blue rinse and  Caddy driving class happy is all they are about when the sun is up.  The only thing hip about this place is the replacement joints.    Coffee seems to have been held on life support  and brought out when some unsuspecting fool that refuses to believe in coffee only being  a morning drug. Usually the surroundings  don't bug me but it felt like the Hometown Buffet  , which I can live with until you give me stale bread  past it's sell by date which  I fear may a fitting epitaph for this place within daylight hours

After watching an advert for large burgers in 3d Phoenix was sunny with no sign of cheeseburger. Didn't  stop at the nearest place, Johnny Rockets ,and we went a bob bob bobbin' along to Red Robin.  Near 4 in the afternoon isn't a busy time but the service-dividend one would hope to reap wasn't  present.   Greetings, placement, balloon for kid all happy:) time to drinks good. Then not so much.   Ordered a burger that had jalapenos as part of the garnish. What i got was double fried, at least, and cold .While the server did go back and get some  it's a pain in the ass to have to open up, pick them out, and wait for the new ones to get back. It's a small thing? Maybe so small that anyone with brains would not serve cold, fat sodden and about as far from crispy as you can get in the first place.Paltry number of fries ( seemingly you can ask for more but found that out a little too late  The bun was claimed to be a jalapeno,meant to be chipotle mayo  and the burger was meant to have seen cayenne. Tasted fine, just not gourmet  in terms of ingredients and presentation.  My wife's BLTA was the straggliest SINGLE piece of bacon we've seen in a long time and the 2 piece of avocado  seemed to have visited the same health farm as the pig:)   Slow refills, had to ask for mine. Wife's refilled but way late in meal.  Poor value. realistically it's about 2.25 rounded down.

Why Meh?    The state of repair on the games made this a voyage of discovery, e.g, with a 2 hour unlimited card I could work out which machines actually worked:)   .I'd rather have a downed machine than something that is unplayable but maybe I'm just unlucky that I hit the 4/5 games with issues in my first plays.   End Ghost Recon.. gun on left won't hold steady target  jumps all over.  Opposite of it : Need for speed Carbon has a intermittent brake pedal which won't let the car go too fast) Mechwarrior 4/ Beach-head 2000 unit.. Hideously slow , jumping frames, jerking hydraulics, broke after playing.  Can't get 8 way direction on left side of tekken 5   Gave up and played Galaga after that:) Yeah left / right fire that works:/ Variety is lacklustre, Shoot, Drive , and oh shoot AND drive is about all you get with rare fighting games, not a single vertical  / horizontal scroller

It's cynical beyond belief re the food and not that well thought out re the games.   The games are not really well thought out in relation to the ages they cater for. Our six year old  couldn't see  above the modded "gun" games,nor reach pedals on the couple of race games there were. There are no steps/ accommodations for that and  he's too old for the simple games. Ergo.. not a lot to keep a kid used to Gameworks or Jillian's busy.    Staff were friendly,helpful and attentive, the place was clean but  that's not really a selling point,that's meant to be a given. Our son still had fun so when you are aiming at kids without standards fun can be had.   They have the audience, we're already paying over the top for the food so seriously spend the extra $ or 2 on the pizza and add it into the price. $17 for edible vs $15 for 3/4 left would be a nice thing. I can't reconcile  their website's "fresh"  ingredients with the pizza motif floor-tiling we received.  :update. Letter to their Corp office went unanswered seems like they know what they are doing:)  2nd update. Eventually got a call but it was agreed that we disagreed on how pizza should taste, they may use fresh mozzarella daily and new dough 2x a week but it's been brutalized to the point it's scare to rise:) .. Main review still stands.

First time visitor: Found via yelp.Isn't it always the way. Just as we found somewhere fun to eat for breakfast  along comes something shinier , newer and  a wee bit less crazier than Otto's mountains of food.  Coffee is much better than the dishwater I've been getting at many morning places too.  I love the choice given for filling up the breakfast burrito   In my case a Chorizo, mushroom and Jalapeno and a choice of cheese plus the usual suspects. Not greasy, not anything other than  great and a reasonable size to be filling yet not require an extended nap for the remainder of the day.  Hashbrowns are kinda bland, nicely crisped but lacking in anything underneath. The corned beef hash was good, didn't appear overly salty and mixed in nicely with ketchup (blasphemy:) )   Service wise, Heather, was a whirlwind of courteous, timely service as were all the people we interacted with.  Seriously the public intensity I've only seen in Waffle houses without the accompanying ear crushing cacophony of shouted orders and plate clacking. Only bringing this up since others have made it a negative point  and I stress I've only been here once to date.   This is easily worth 15 mins wait for  on a Sat Morning for the adherence to your order, speed and quality of the food that comes out.   Does not take Amex.  - 1/2 star hash browns bland  in the middle -1/2 star

After a couple of years going here I am upping it to a well deserved five.   I realized this after being on a  low iodine diet for 2 weeks ,eating nothing with salt,dairy,seafood or more than 6oz of meat a day,I waited and drove the extra 30 minutes from where I was to break my fast here.   I solved my hash brown issue by putting a cup of their green chili over it: Perfected  my burrito with  1 egg, chorizo, american cheese,peppers, avocado, and jalapenos ( as I said mine;) )   and the Amex thing , pah I'm an idiot.. that's been corrected, the review I mean  I'm still an idiot.   Staff have been  uniformly great, coffee barely goes dry, prices are totally reasonable because I usually don't need lunch on the days I eat here.

Usually when I leave one of our regular sushi places we're satiated and  $30 richer.  It's not that this is a bad place but value for money for pseudo Japanese cooking is not to be found. The udon was thin and the accompanying dish was forgettable. Yes there's sushi in the name but that doesn't excuse the lack of imagination on the entree list.   Sushi wise the Spicy cowboy roll was spicier than their wings and is a really good roll.    Height on most chairs make it obvious, along with no kids menu that your sushi loving 5 year old  should go fishing elsewhere.  Having said that  $9 bento box with katsu is pretty good value though the miso that comes with it doesn't  stand up alongside a premium packet of miso from Lee lees   Was quiet ( 230 on a Sat afternoon)    It's just not worth the premium in relation to the good places a couple of miles away

We've paid them money for one car. They are getting to work on another.   I can't think of any garage that we've had work on both our cars ( bikes yes, cars no)    We had narrowed down the rough problem but have a vacation coming up, work to get to and  the chance that I could mess it up  led me to check out mechanics on Yelp.   Glad I did.   We managed to get a quick appointment.  Sadly we had an intermittent fault, the worst and usually most expensive kind.    After they  noticed that  Erin  understood terms above and beyond  Steering thing, go button and Mr Stoppy     trust me that was the level of the usual condescension that we received from shops prior she was treated like  .. ta da!  a customer:D    While they couldn't conclusively guarantee the problem being the lead to the starter ( as I said intermittent)  they were generous with the  diagnostic fee  and rather than  do the usual  replacement job  seem to have fixed it . E.g I'm happier with a  realistic fair estimate than blind replacement that seems to be practiced at most shops.  They call when they say they will, offer to arrange loaners and so far I'm really impressed. Soon as something more substantial requires work will revisit the rating.

I wish it were possible for everyone to experience the hell that is most American themed restaurants in the UK to get an idea of the hell that is   most Irish bar experiences here.    We were in the area,  far away from the usual cider tap and couldn't wait the extra 15 minutes to get to somewhere we like. (silly) I started with a  potato and leek soup with a pretty uneven consistency when blended,a touch above bland but it's my fault I should have checked to see if it was cream based/ blended over containing visible leeks / potatoes in a veg stock as usually the leek flavor tends to get lost but it was edible and set  expectations for the entrée. Out of a very limited number of dishes that you could shoe-horn into being a friend of a friend  of Irish food I chose  Irish Stew with Guinness.  It  was pretty generous but for stewed meat it wasn't that tender and hard to discern the presence of the featured ingredient.  Only one cider available, Magners , look at sign, look at  decor which for a moment had confused me into thinking it was an Irish pub. - *    Service was good,2.5 rounded down  to 1 because it's pricey for the what you get and not that well executed at that.   Maybe Yelp should have aggregate marks for bar/ restaurants and then a combined total  because it's  possible to be a good one of the former while lagging in the latter.

R.T. O'Sullivan's ( more than  six months back  things may have changed but my prior two visits had us   walking out re time it took to serve us/ and then  forgot to  cook part of the order. )  It's about as Irish as Sobriety  ( Yeah I have the Celtic passport to back that slander up)   Chicken Wings Plain, BBQ, Teriyaki, Mild, Medium, Hot, Death or HELL !(no returns on HELL) Served with celery and ranch dressing.  I think I get it, they are being ironic... Because if you get what you want it's not hell!.   The thought of an Irish bar without cider is as laughable as a French bar sans wine or a burger joint that doesn't have   coke but would you like a nice green tea? Er no.   No hard apple cider in stock , please perry, aka pear cider is fine but it's not frickin' cider and there seems to be some reality problems with bars here.   NM , ok I do mind .. The wings, HELL? , HELL-o I thought I was meant to be in mortal danger here. Seemingly a sauce mild enough to douche with is their idea of hell.. mine is paying $8 to be sorely disappointed, again. Gets better they totally forgot to bring out the wife's main course..   No black pudding on the menu and still insisting that Corn beef / cabbage is from the old country and not an American invention  oh well, it's a theme  ,it's not reality.    It's really an opportunistic "schtick" to tie a  run of the mill sports bar with some character.

Fecking Great.      Update:  Went for lunch:   This time I thought the corned beef taquitos even  better than last, curry chips tad saltier.  Still loving the appetizers and the cider.  This time had the  cottage pie,  it's  really nothing to write home about, specially if you are from the region and your parent's wouldn't appreciate you seeing other cottage pies;)    Spend the extra on the sheperds  it's really much better.   This was ok , really really nothing special and the heat could have been better.   Service  is good, but pedestrian , the last time I had no time pressure, this time I did.     We're sitting at 3.5 - 3.75 now with the round up till 4. Still  I'll return    Original Review:  First thanks to Julie P for pointing out that this place exists. That it's within stumbling distance of the house ( think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour  versus a quick trip and recover)  is even better.  Cider on tap is Strongbow and you get it in a real pint., Yay.  Sadly that's all they have and there's no bottled ones to try ,  Strongbow is  the Bud of UK ciders and while it's way better than no cider or what passes for beer here it's not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar.   Onto the Food  (I'll get to it as a venue some other time)   Appetizers.  Curry and chips was exactly what it should have been  and a generation of Irish and UK kids have  grown up with this for lunch  at the local chip shop.      The  corned beef and cabbage taquitos  I think  are moving up to be our #1 appetizer that's not a hot wing. Taste of these  and the hot mustart / tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely. Not heavy on the fat and delightfully  crunchy.  For once an Irish restaurant trying to do something other than name US staples with cute regional names.   Main: Salad   and the sheperd's pie. Let's not get into the salad it's a waste of time reviewing vegetables.  The pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other. Not sure the champ ( mashed potatos ) atop them live up to what lies below but it's more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish.    Bread and Butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal DON'T just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car.   Oddity?    parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green , please just buy green speckled plates , it's classier:D  At the end got a coupon for 25% off the next bill which I will certainly take them up on. It's as good  for food as any of the valley's Irish bars ( better imho)  but have to get back on pub quiz night  to really know.  Were in too early to hear the band but you can look at the pa, the space and  know it's going to sound  bad ( place looks like standing wave city)  with anything electric and full drum set.     The jukebox played "i'm too sexy " by Right said fred  WTF that really  messed up the ambience.Country bars don't have NIN on the box after all.

I have to start with an old UK Joke.   "How did you find the steak and kidney pie? "     "I moved a chip...    The plusses. They have hard cider:) The chips are not those evil stringy jokes  that  pass for fast food places "or the  crisp and crunchy variants they are pretty  close to decent home made chips  but  having grown up in the uk and eating this for  3-4 years during college   ( and they wonder why Scots have the most heart disease  outside of  New Orleans:))   this is  not just like home.       This is still very much  fish and chips at the "sit down"   rather than take out level. E.g   They are adequate but  didn't kick me back  nostalgia wise and  so far in the US I've not found decent ( aka bad:)  UK food that didn't come out of one or two suppliers  in the states and was lovingly heated to the same directions.   The steak and kidney pie, holy heck it was lame. I'm eating offal here so you have to give me some credit for knowing when the piss is being taken.   It's not an fully enclosed pie like they would serve in the UK which is finger food meant to be consumed on the move which doesn't describe this 80% crust to filling ratio at all.  This needs a fork, and  not that big a one cos three  trawls of the pieplate was all I  got out of it.  So far the only place that has gotten remotely  close to UK pastry  is the  Cornish pastie co in Tempe. Seriously this alone took it from 3 to 2 stars.If it cost $2 more but actually contained the advertised ingredients in identifiable lumps I'd be happier as it is less insulting  in the long run.   Nearly everyone else fakes it  and cooks a filling, then crust and marries them later  to heat. Having ketchup in packets is just bloody annoying, not having brown sauce out  likewise.       Hint  Cross the road. Go to the Indian grocery , to their freezer  section and get their steak and kidney pie /  steak pie /  any pie   , Go to Codfather for chips,  stick the two together.

God I miss this place. We started going about 2 months back and have been a regular there , at least once a week since finding it via Yelp. I'm in Scotland for three weeks and there's apparently nothing as good as this venue.   While this may not be important to people this was by far the "fastest" turnaround from order to table, flowed nicely and didn't end up like the usual traffic-accident-at-sushi-central  that we've had on the tiny tables at Tokyo Lobby, or the table shuffle dance at  Fresh Wasabe    The entrance shows an attention to detail that appears throughout the room.  I'm still new to sushi so the chance to try as much of it as I can for reasonable prices has been a winner.  After 8 o clock the happy hour,till close, has many interesting rolls for $5 and large Sapparos ,bottle,for $3.The latter is a public service that should be recognised by the good people of Phoenix and awarded a Yen Sushi day. Love the staff, the food's been great..   The sashimi tuna in garlic aioli sauce appetizer is amazing, yeah it's not cheap but with the happy hour on it pays off nicely to experiment. I can't wait till I'm back stateside again:)

Three weeks ago, I started a review that I haven't gotten to the bottom of yet:)    We were at the Yelp event,failing to pry anything free from the pizza vultures,and decided to just go ahead and order anyway.  I.E.,this is a payed for the food review for the most part.   Even though this was a really busy,loud night,our orders came out quickly ,correct and were really tasty.Luckily we caught a free bruschetta plate while ordering so we managed to try all of them by the end of the night by buying those we'd missed.   Ordered x 2 personal pizza and the chocolate ice cream dessert.The pizzas are way better on the top than what which supports them but  that's not to say the dough is bad it's just not matching the promise of that which sits above it.. Dessert was the OMG for two a chocolate espresso brownie with vanilla  ice cream. Nowhere near as dense as it sounds or as sickly as it could be.Really well done.  Maybe not a fair assessment to make on just one night but I've not been back yet to see how much variation between pizzas there are.Prices fairly reflect the location,interior and the quality of the ingredients being used.   I'd go back if in the region, I'd meet people there as a kick off point but I can't say I'd drive from the W Valley just to eat here. ( Isn't that true of Mill Ave in general though?) .  3.75 rounded to 4. ( edited for grammar , no other changes)

Kicks any of the majors severely in the grease trap.   It's like an In and Out with a menu, a Freddy's custard with better tasting food:)  It's hard to pick between them since on their basic items they are all pretty good in relation to anything with a 'king clown  of a ping pong ball advertising them.      Good selection of sodas on tap, quick turnaround at lunch time and a change from string fries to crinkles.   Here's why it's getting a 4.   They syrups   used on the custard are nowhere near good enough to match what they are sitting atop. Banana's foster is great custard, fresh bananas and a hot syrup  that sadly screams cheapness and has a one note flavor.

The food's been covered before so all this review will be is further social proof that this place does indeed rock.    I've missed good veal cannelloni for a while now , looks like I wont need to anymore:)    For once it's not the processed grey stuffing that has one texture throughout  surrounded by an inner tube ( Cough  famous chain)    Erin's  Pollo Piccata was excellent  and the accompanying pasta was perfect.  Sadly  they fed me too well since I was dying to try the tiramisu  but the afternoons plans didn't involve  refrigeration.  Lastly thanks to all that  saw the excellent reviews and kept piling them on it really makes a big difference on how likely we've been to try new places.

I am amazed that people are queuing to get to the Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill when  food as good as this is available for a tiny bit more money in far nicer surroundings than  aforementioned chains.    This is a small Seattle based chain that is "hiding" out on Greenway   and does not deserve to be as quiet on a week night as we found it this Wednesday.     The wedding soup was excellent   I'm pretty sure that's home made stock from the bones  ( either that or they have a kick ass supply house)  but it was really nice, flavor from all the ingredients came through.   Main course Cannelloni  which was very enjoyable, piping hot, and nicely stuffed .   Let down?  Frozen tiramisu   which is a shame as I think they could pull off a great one  if they did as well as the prior two course. Nice  staff too.  Come on  please keep them busy we want to keep going back here:D   Physically it's a really nice looking restaurant , outdoor patio's nice but  sadly they can't really help the Kmart  to the side or the Goodwill on the other side  best stay indoors :)

How can I tell I am enjoying myself? When an avid carnivore such as myself comes out happy after  picking on the  beans and vegetables on this planet.   The portions , for such a thin clientele, are large.  Someone mentioned the attractiveness of the staff and that would be a fair statement. ( Then again anyone with purple anything and Flogging Molly shirt had me at hello to begin with:)    Quick service, drinks filled quickly.   I had the black bean burger   with roasted red bell pepper, mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions on a 12-grain bread, served with blue corn chips, pico de gallo and garlic new potatoes.    Really good bread, didn't get soggy or fall to bits prior to finishing it off and the price was  close to  what you end up paying subway for their " high end" sandwiches   The appetizer  isn't really rated since  dolmas  have such a wide range of  ingredients , like pakora,  you often don't know what you're going to get. It's not that these are bad, they just have  a consistency that's  too close to a couple of foods I really hate.   The tsatziki and pita though I can happily recommend  as being really good for the former and good enough on the latter.   Decor,  great apart from the ceiling which would appear to be the surplus left over from the diners.  It's just odd to have such a well put together floor and sides , add in a great big mirror above a waiting area with fireplace and then reflect this gaudy embossed carbunkle back at us as if we hadn't had enough:). ( didnt' affect rating but I'm convinced it's not helping the relative noise level of the place at  lunch time)

Z'ees ez not ze bad pizza no?  Ok I'll can the crap and add a  warm fuzzy feeling to this place.   Firstly the  dough is thin, not the brittle kind of thin that practically snaps  in two cleanly that the Pizza hut, Dominos give you , there's more twist and cushioning there but I don't think my experiments stress testing a pizza will help you make a choice.    The reviews on the Tuesday  2 x deal.  They are not as fast as most of the other choices , there is no delivery charge though the pizza is about a delivery charge more expensive ( TANSTAAFL) it's more than made up for in the quality of ingredients and size.     These guys are now our goto  Tuesday night pizza.     Online Ordering  is available and  quite frankly we've been eating from the "big 3" and the locals now of  five years . A change is good, a good change is much better:)

Ok  they really  blew it tonight:  20 mins on hold, had to hang up to call back. First they are out of the pesto sauce,   no  Mediterranean pizza.once more they  forget the sauce  on the bread sticks for the 3rd time in   orders.      I don't  get how they can crap away  what they have by this  lack of attention to detail. ( Have since been contacted by them to try and work it out.   Seems x2 Tuesdays is way popular. )    Will post appropriate updates

Spoke with the owner with regards to our issues and we had a trial  run of   deliveries. First one used my name ( now known to the place sadly)  and was quick  and correct.  Ah but my other half thought it was TOO good so ordered with her name later in the week and .. yep back to usual missing items we'd paid for.    In short  we're through.     I have some empathy for the nature of their business and offer   of x 2 Tuesdays causing some timing / service issues but in the end  I don't want this to reflect on any of their other stores. Just this one and just at this time. Wake me up when they start to  deliver on their promise.

Six months have elapsed and I have to say that I'm glad to say things have gotten far better at this location. We've ordered weekly for the past month and the Items are ready  when they say they will be, the ingredients are still top notch and more importantly present on the pizza:)    2 x Tuesday deal is a steal but you are going to wait way longer than it would take you to drive down from anywhere in the delivery area:)    This , once again, looks like the start of a tasty relationship. :)

Casual restaurant seems to have been mistaken as a requirement on the staff, not the customers.   In a far from full restaurant.  Long time to get from door to seat, from seat to drink, from drink to appetizer.The inferno wings are a cruel , dry and salty joke.  Less heat than a jalapeno and drier a Stephen Fry observation given at midday in death valley.     We both had the same 8oz steak, well one of us may have had because one was frigging tiny.  I seriously feel like punching myself in the gut because we paid the same here as we did at Fresh Wasabi in Glendale the day prior. http://www.yelp.com/biz/fresh-wasabi-glendale

Currently closed for renovation, been out last 2 weeks.   Pricey is kinda subjective , I eat here at lunch and for the price of a "---berto's" plate I get to sit in a nice atmosphere , get  great salsa with  flavor and decent dose of heat    So far no complaints with service and I have a  pretty short lunch time. What stops it being great? Well this is a weak four as my meals have been an odd kinda mix  of great   ingredients , prepared consistently well  E.G, salsa, the beans, the rice, the side veggies  are way above most of the fare in similar restaurants  but the protein  comes out a bit bland and is carried by the surrounding material which is a shame.    If you have friends that think Macoa's  is great this should blow them away:)

Despite the tone of this review I will be going back to check them out during their regular service.  How a place that's been rated  Yay! consistently could serve such uninspired  institutional dreck on Thanksgiving is a puzzle worth investigating.  Regardless how good they are usually the idea that it's OK for turkey dinner to consist of lunchmeat turkey , yep not part of a single breast but some formed  sliced  close to deli meat at Fry's,excuse for a turkey.  Seriously this has to be a one off?   On the grocery story theme sweet potatoes, canned, no gravy,undercooked cornbread stuffing, grainy cranberry sauce  rounded off with a lacklustre dessert which was still thawing.  The only saving grace was the BBQ meat / sauce itself  which,gosh, probably was made in house and I wouldn't mind more of.   Service was good, despite the in-law's treating the server abruptly , and all in all it's a pretty nice  atmosphere for family dining during the day.

In context  of eating prior to  hockey.  We've usually avoided this location on game night since the 30-45 min waits rarely fit in with our plans.This Saturday ,Mar14th ,we made a deliberate attempt to get in , waited 30 mins. Got in around 1800, game starts 1900 . The appetizer, entree and drinks were pretty good but we had 2 1/2 yard drinks  which made it hard to have the plate right in front of us.     1/2 a burger and 1/2 the fries are just swept up by the staff. No attempt to verify our intentions just whoosh.  Server Aimee was apologetic and would have gotten us replacement fries ( no burger seemingly) or the manager but we had a game to get to that would have been disrupted by either offer. The $80 check for two people has to come with a degree of care and attention that weren't obvious.  So the food is certainly worth a 3.5 , but I can't recall the last time we had our plates taken with such "reckless efficiency"  Update: Have received a $25  certificate for this process and will  put it towards another outing( probably at another  of their locations).   Update 2:  Actually we reconsidered it and decided that  this was a poor attempt to resolve a situation that shouldn't have occurred. It's off our list.

I would hate to start any review with " there are two kinds of...."  but since this is a review related to motorcycle clothing  , kinda related to two, wheels that is,  but I'll save it till later.  Buying a helmet unseen, second hand or because  it came free with the bike are usually the kind of people that are cranky after a long ride.  While I respect the choice of people to not wear  helmets  please respect mine to laugh at you:)   My wife's helmet is on display at this shop as a reminder that local laws are one things but the laws of physics tend not to be so transient.    We've bought 3 helmets from here,  they have an excellent range   both in prices, styles ( open , closed ,modular, mx , etc)  and  often different grades of finish for each type. Price wise they won't be the cheapest , that pesky sakes tax thing but..,  but in terms of service in the choice and fitting you are unlikely to spend time  returning the item you bought .and  if you have to it's painless process.    Good range of personal accessories,  visors, gloves, socks  and footwear which tends more to the street than the track / bar. Even better they keep the visors, part kits and  other knick knacks to service the popular lines that they sell .  They give good advice based on your questions, actually know about the  helmets,their construction, effectiveness and will take the time to make sure you get what you need.    Yep there's two kinds of people bikers and motorcyclists.  It's interesting to me that the crotch rocket types wear only a helmet then  shorts,tshirt and sneakers  and the Harley types  wear heavy boots, leather, jackets and  er no helmet.    Helmet Center is more to the street side overall but  if you need a helmet, now and actually care about the contents of it  I really don't think you can get a better experience  on the north side of Phoenix and probably the valley as a whole.

The most exciting part our child had while visiting this exhibition was the train ride there when a train was passing in the opposite direction.  I've not  been to a single science exhibit of this stature in the UK or the US that fails to capture the imagination as this one does. Not only are their typos on their displays,they can't even locate Yellowstone park correctly on their earthquake map for Yogi's sake.   It's not just the small things the mismatching of the video screens, particularly in the polar section, is really off-putting and maybe they want you to sit in case you get motion sickness and fall over?  It's dull, I don't mean the topic but the whole experience, which is in fairly low light, with loads of text to read to the young ones. Loads of text without a lot of contrast.E.G, The ocean section has sheets that undulate the text back and forward and unless you are right at the bar it's pretty hard to pick up.   Food is basic and, well it's edible so, let's leave it at that .Here we have yet another ecologically aware science exhibit that sells utter crap in the gift shop for the most part. It would be nice if they could practice the kind of restraint the walls urge the visitors to do.   It's not all bad the 360 theater is pretty impressive but a really basic movie was showing on the day we went. I.E., what's an astronomer? The movie overstates Galileo a bit and left Copernicus out entirely,that's nice but it's indicative of the cursory geology, astronomy, biology et all within the exhibit that tries to fit too much into a small space and everything suffers from it.  I think kids over 7 will start to get more out of it  but it's light for things to do below that age.  ( edited for typos / grammar)

Upgraded to 4 stars.  Went back for the lunch special and walked out well fed and relatively well off  the lunch special and drink came to a tiny bit over $7.    It's  not a place to be in a rush ( e.g if you are grab and go) but  it's by no means excessive . I used to be patient back home but the US has reset  my  internal service clock   from  Q to now! so it's probably not that accurate an assessment.      It's fresh,  it's reasonably priced, clean and isn't a taco, burger, chicken item and holy crap real plates, real silverware.    May not seem like a big thing  but it's really hard to take people to lunch  from work  were paper  and plastic refers  not to the take out bag but to the  utensils and plates.   And it's next door to the Ducati store:)

Based on the pretty good breakfast I had with the wifelette on Saturday morning  I thought I would go back for lunch.   Lunchtime was not that hot,literally. I ordered the country steak and gravy which comes with toast and a green bean casserole. It may seem churlish to rate such a dish because it's country steak  after all but this was the non home made mechanical-animal project for meat reclamation type of steak. Hideously uniform with the kind of bread crumb regimentation only possible with your most OCD robots. At least it was hot.   The green bean casserole was reheated,depleted and defeated by the time it made my plate.Soggy potato chips were there should have been crisp texture is not an attractive item and I got to two spoonfuls prior to abandoning the deal. Microwaving seemed likely re the hot spots in the dish.  The mashed potatoes were cold  but I could warm them up with the really hot country steak to get a tepid taste sensation going.   Pretty disappointed.   Here's why.  Why have two main ingredients that proclaim your quality, the  fresh OJ and the for real ham on-the-bone, and then phone it in with institutional canteen grade casserole, meat and potatoes?  The only saving grace on the steak was the heat and the decent sausage gravy that accompanied it. but alas  2/3 parts of the meal are re or no-heats.

The American love affair of  breakfast =  eggs has always frustrated me. It's my living version of the  Monty Python spam song. Trying to substitute eggs in most places leads to the kind of look that could be expected had you asked them to reassemble an already cracked egg and push it  into the hen's vent for the next diner.  -  So I didn't even try .  I ordered a open face chili burger and hashbrowns. They'd run out of biscuits, yep that's why there's no five.  No biscuits and gravy is as acceptable as unsweetened ice tea.. never:)  The dish that arrived was a housing project! I am no stranger to the x3 hash browns at the Waffle Hut ( I take my  bitch there after all ) but I couldn't  clear my plate and nor could my wife finish hers .  We're seriously thinking about splitting a plate between us next time.   Coffee service was constant, almost religiously so.  This is a real breakfast , for a really fair price and I look forward to visiting again.

Two? Seriously how it's all new and shiny and yet has no sockets readily accessible next to the bed. If you sleep with a Cpap that's kinda a big deal and why don't I carry a cord with me?  Oh I don't know because in every motel, hotel, resort and suite I've stayed in over the last decade in several countries hasn't frigging needed one!     Yep that's about all I can give a hotel that makes a BFD over it's technology and then provides a TV distribution system that has the sound and picture out of sync on many channels. Where three of the lights are blown  which is total BS that doesn't just happen on the same day or two so there's a feeling of  no one cares from the moment you get in.     Didn't enjoy a lot about this hotel which in comparison to a one of its sister hotels , The Signature, failed to excite in anyway bar  one of the shops and the patisserie.   I don't like being "carded"  when hands are full of coffee and yummy pastries. So  I have to put them down just to get to the elevator I have enough issues with badges, keys and photos at work that the last thing I need to relax is a fucking gargoyle incurring pastry damage and overflowing coffee on my hands. You know for such a technology driven place maybe they could have keyed the entrance against the door keys?   At that point , 2nd day I thought , nope never staying here again.  The room was listed as Deluxe City View Room which we completely failed to get on the 4th floor. ( unless you like valet parking) and are $30 more a night.  Physically I love the space and materials but all the things I like about this place I can enjoy as a visitor being a guest really counts for very little.

After a couple of emails they have agreed to refund the price difference between the room paid for and the room received. I'm glad because I do like a lot of the other properties in the group and it would have been a pain to avoid them in the future.  As I said in the main body of review  you can get all the best parts out of the Aria as a visitor and I wouldn't mind going back to Radiance ( really nice jewelry store ) and the Thai restaurant within it.

I should just stop calling these reviews part of my cider tour of the Phoenix area and seek sponsorship from Strongbow instead because it's the only draught they, being bars with an Irish theme, have other than the one blowing up my arse about these being Irish pubs that is.  Don't worry by my second pint this review gets friendlier.   Let's start with the appetizers and the curious price of curry and chips. $8.95.The price of the curry sauce and the chips ($2.50 and $4.00 when ordered separately)  is an application of new math that I find puzzling. *  Ok the first pint is warming me up and it's time to praise the banger wontons Nope it's not an Asian street gang but a dab of pork sausage and herbs within a wonton wrapper.  These are really good, pretty inventive and the spicy sauce that comes with them ( seems to be HP , Vinegar and something I can't quite put my  tongue on ( horseradish?)  , while good, is a little  overpowering for the center.  We really liked these.  Pint 2:  My wife had the beer battered fish and chips and loved them but she'll get to that in her review. I had the shepherd's pie boxty , basically ground lamb/ beef  wrapped up in a potato based crepe/ pancake.  The filling was light, moist and nicely spiced  unlike the usual attempts by most places to hide up a culinary crime scene. E.g If you can't do the thyme...  The accompanying veggies, asparagus and peppers were a nice touch and you can see the visual appeal of the dish on the accompanying picture.   Desert.   We had. ok we ordered,  the Irish whiskey creme brulee , most of the desserts here are about as Irish as George Takei, and it was absent of any whiskey taste that either of us could discern.It's OK but a let down given the promise.    Knocking off .5 stars for that and the appetizer pricing.   Food came out really quickly  in under 10 mins. It  was about 1430 when we came in and the place was kinda quiet. Mallory provided great service throughout.  *I wrote their corp office and Eric returned an explanation within an hour. the disparity in the chip/curry conundrum lies with the curry sauce. The "side" of sauce is supposed to be 3oz less than the appetizer.

Been back several times now. The only fault  is the price which seems dissonant with the address. Isn't the  whole point of  Irish food, least as mythologized,is the hearty cheap nature of it?  $14 for a boxty is taking us for eejits. So far the best we've found on the West side but I'd rather hit McCaffrey's up unless I'm really close to this one.

From a couple of months back.  No coffee ready took quite a while because they didn't have cups clean. NO ,really.  No chipotle wings because they are out of sauce. Server walked off before wife could order. 10 plus mins to return so you can guess how this review is going to add up.   Wife got angry with me because my surprise was quite audible re the cup excuse.10-15 mins to locate and clean a cup but at that point I was just hoping to get the meal over with.   Maybe it's my own fault but the service kinda changed from dismissive to not quite hostile but with a degree of contempt usually found  on staff at  tow yards. If you have a gluten free family member it's really really hard to find places to go  but at near $80 bill for 3 GF pizzas, 1 app and no real drinks  it just doesn't have the service to cover  the cost for "ok" pizza.  Really not doing a food review because if you have any reason at all to eat real pizza you don't need to come here:)

we got married here a couple of months back and to say the least we had an unconventional wedding.  A pirate/ discordian mash-up with my friend offiating , in full pirate regalia, for the first time.     This wasn't last minute planning, say about last 2 weeks and we didn't go all out on flowers, decorations , or well anything as we'd like to do a fll wedding when the family is availble for it.    For a small wedding parking wasn't a problem, neither was set up for the Bride and Groom ,  20 people , plus a few support staff, can easily fit in  and hear the service at the front of the room.  Rev Amy was  very accommodating of the informality of the event ,  did us a quick "for sure" service  in 30 secs after the  public wedding just in case AZ didn't go for ordination by mail.   Quick , professional , clean location and easy to set up  on the day I needed at such short notice.  It's hard to judge the gamut of services as we didn't  need them , obviously don't intend on being a repeat customer:),    None of our guests said a bad word, most were complimentary. There's  so many ways to get married and this fitted our needs wonderfully.

Been here 3 times in the month and have had a different experience each time. E.G., Older guy talks to you , younger staff, ( either sex) tend to communicate in a perfunctory manner so it's not the great service one goes for.  Onto the ice itself,First two visits was an improvement over the usual attempt at  shave ice in Phoenix and the spread of the syrup and retention till the end were pretty good. Today's made it half-way down  then ice all the way and the visit prior was close to that too.   Tropical sno's flavors aren't that subtle , not  a huge fan of the insulated cups for the larger sizes which seems to be an issue with how the ice on the bottom  freezes into bigger lumps that doesn't happen on the smaller plastic cup.   Maybe a 3 on a good day but not much more.  While it takes not much more effort to get this right I'm betting you can' t do it within the contstraints of a franchise..

The Mediterranean place that closed down has morphed into  Siam Oishi a Japanese - Thai, the best thing I can say about it is the bikes parked outside from the Ducati shop improve the view.    I've only had one meal here but it's not likely to get a recommendation to the people at work. I kinda hate that I kick off with a negative review  but  this isn't that cheap a place for the quality of food I received. I had lunch bento 4 chicken katsu. This comes in a plastic bento tray, salad, rice, katsu and a couple of slices of orange.   You also get miso soup which was pretty poor and the dashi base was rather too much like a chicken stock with little flavor in the supporting ingredients . ( Zen Sushi spoils us)    The Katsu was apparently fried more than once, with an intermediate cooling period, was really fat laden and is readily beaten at  Ono's, or to be frank any order of katsu i've had in the last, oh lifetime.  It wasn't white it was saturated with oil for that nice yellow color.   We have too many good places  around $9 at lunch, Saigon nites,  Thai House and Indian paradise  (on a good day) to make this part of the lunch rotation.

The food may all be the same but with nearly all convenience meals it's the people that make or break how you feel about it. After all in two weeks are you going to recall what was in that burrito versus the way the staff treated you ?    Really really well. Despite the person in front of me inquiring about the relative healthfulness of the options available he helped her out as much as it's practical without the level of annoyance/ amusement that would have had me flicking pinto beans at their nose .   Still  moving on to me, crowd came up quickly, they changed gear  into dining speed but still managed to ask about the day, t-giving and the like both the counter staff were not faking in a manner I feel certain coffee shops appear to require, cough bucks.That's why I like this, and every other ,Chipotle   it's not the food but the people.    Burrito was pretty good and more importantly  viable to eat and drive with ( who says texting is the greatest danger out there:D ) which is a skill that most ____ Bell places can't remotely conceive of with a third of the contents.

Good solid mass market  Chinese American food. Excellent value with the combos. Staff are great.   The food is above average for the price point, service certainly above it.It would be a solid 3 star place.  Tried five dishes, two soups and had no complaints with 4/5 of them. The sweet and sour pork was just not to our tastes,seemed overcooked . Soups came out fast and entrees followed along at just the right interval.   While it's 3.5 / 5 I've rounded it up to four because the sum really adds up to more than the total of it's parts.

Matches up to the most of the reviews.  Drinks are good, Food is a simulacrum of the named dish.   It's a one time mistake:)

Review of the research phrase.   Unlike our prior awful experience with a BMW  Chapman dealership on Camelback it really took a lot for me to even consider buying anything from this group.   We arrived on wet , cold day, and unlike every other dealer that had us schlepping around a lot   with the kids / carseat in tow ,   he brought the cars to us under their roof.  That's how to start to make a sale right there:)   I have a height problem, stubby legs, long torso and cars with sunroofs rarely fit me. Sadly car companies like to  force them on you coinciding with the kind of features I wanted,  e.g , Nav, power seats only come with a sunroof the alternative being a spartan item  that replaced all the toys with swathes of plastic. He went and looked at the options and quickly told us that it didn't exist and better yet didn't then try to shove us into another vehicle that wouldn't have fitted our needs. ( The Dodge dealer on bell had no such issues with that;) )   I am so sorry I lost your card, because you really do deserve recognition for your attention to detail and helping us try to find the right vehicle.

Been here twice and had a great experience both times.   Good wings, a decent heat from the hot sauce and a decent bottle of hot sauce on the table, TY Tabasco is not the only fruit:)   The appetizers are large, sharing big plate with kid wasn't an issue and realistically your kid needs a big appetite to get through the normal offering.  Entrees are also hearty and probably not the place to attempt their ribs or chicken before any exercise ( plan your dates accordingly )   I just can't get a 5 when the  famously advertised chili beer isn't being made , and the blue moon had ran out.  Bar's selling out of beer when there's not a celtic family reunions just shouldn't happen.  Will return a few more times and I'm betting I can get them up to a 5

How often is it you see a chain fall so far from the standards for such a long period of time and yet corporate seems to just let them limp along.  It's a new , ok relatively new building but it doesn't look it.   Tonight is the second night we've been in a two month period were  no fountain drinks no cafes or drinks other than bottled water, apple juice or milk were around. It's not like we frequent the place but  when someone puts out a habanero burger I feel obligated to support em.    Sadly the burger was the least juicy, scant of dressing one I've encountered so while it hints at getting hot there's not enough  on it to find out.   They appear, no let's be bold here and state it , they reheat / refry  their "premium" crispy chicken wrap   it's nasty even before you get to tonight's surprise which is rancid ranch... Yeah a bite and a run to the trash can to hurl it out..  As usual  no receipt, no real F's given about the lack of drinks, slow service  in fact  the opposite of the one up at T Bird / I17   If you have to eat  fast  and can go the extra couple of miles it probably will save you time and  result in edible food

It's hard to not give this a five and I may just end up doing so just to frustrate people that hate seeing perfect scores: Seriously I was skeptical but after what seems like a streak of  3 star reviews I finally have something good to report on the end of the food chain I can speak to:)   Is it the best chili cheese dog I've had? No.The best  chilli-cheese fries? No.Most extensive selection of sodas? Again no but truly this place adds up to more than the sum of its parts.It has nearly the best of all three  in one friendly, clean place that I'm looking forward to returning to.   Their Chili-cheese dog takes Sonic's to school and steals its lunch money. The texture of  fine ground meat  / amount makes it easy enough to eat and theirs actually has flavor in the chilli, you know  unlike every chain that tries to sell you the same thing.   When added to cheese and the  fries it was really great  though my preference is for fatter fries this was a great portion for the money.    Wife's  bare lettuce and meat burger was tasty with maybe a slightly enthusiastic shake of the seasonings  but to be fair if it was a fully dressed burger I bet it would be hard to tell.  Kid's Cheese burger ,oh yes, very very good and hopefully he appreciates now why we keep him away from that clown.     Really the choice is great, the soda's great,  friendly people that ask, and really seem to care, if you liked the food give this a 4.5   rounded to five.

Hoping this is very much an interim review because my experience was so bad that I  managed a bite, waited for family to finish eating, and then went to get some bad food ( jack in the box) to cheer me up with the refund.   The latter was  fast and hot ,the antithesis of the Bueno Burger meal.    I will stipulate that the results of the evening were heavily influenced by under-staffing and a first night on the job cook  regardless half an hour to be served a chill bun, with tepid meat dragged down by cold ingredients ,in a very cold restaurant , was unpleasant to touch let alone stick in the mouth. That it comes at a premium was just annoying.   Side onion rings were not hot either  which is kinda a no-brainer to get   Thankfully the manager ,in charge , probably the best thing about this place, has a clue  and  refunded mine and gave us a card for a future burger because there's a real disconnect between the reviews and our experience last  Friday and I wouldn't mind being proven wrong.

After the first trip I returned  two more times  with my young son after  a particularly bad first impression.   Two burgers.    One  Arizona style  This is not one to take away , the amount of sour cream  was excessive and dragged down the temperature of an already struggling patty.  It was edible and cooked this time.  Green chili had a nice taste on the isolated bit that wasn't drowning in sour cream and I would probably like it in a burrito. Onion rings also had heat in them too.     One Bueno style.   Same issue one small piece of meat trying to support all the ingredients that have cooled it down prior to getting the table.    Still slow service, still had a construction area in the middle of it . It's just not doing it for me at $6 for a thin burger drowned out by the  toppings.   2.5 rounded to 2.

This is very much a review of this location and not the chain.   It would be nice if the busy periods where they have an order taker outside was done with a bit more courtesy,"what do you want"  wouldn't be it. Small enough to ignore but add in the fact diet soda has never been root beer, my kids hamburger with only ketchup/tomato now = cheeseburger.Nice one.   Also these have to be the worst travelling burgers re their heat retention. I live pretty close and it wasn't remotely as good as eating it right there, e.g, 3 minutes is a long time in the desirability of this food.   So that's 1 order, 3 things wrong it's like they think they are fricking Wendy's or something:)

It's been over a year since I was here and promised to leave a review. Why wait that long?    One benefit is that I can say that the work done has stood the test of time and other than the title it would be hard for someone not very well versed in used cars to tell it was ever in an accident.   The process of working with LG was very good with  some phone tag, but not excessively so. There were complications from the kind of accident it was and insurance companies involvment that caused delays  plus the difficulty of getting parts from Japan at the time made it hard to get a handle on how long it would take for me to rent a car for.   In the end they helped me out on the deductible as their site says and a few days car rental so It was fair.    I'd be more than happy to take a car back here should the need arise and I'm pretty sure you'll be  in the 4-5 star range when you do.    For me 4.5

I've been eating my way through the menu here and so far I've been impressed with the consistency of the food, freshness of ingredients and  general level of service.  Heat levels are hard to come by, Thai hot is not the adventure it is at other eateries but at least there is something there.    Lunch portion wise it's almost  not enough, in relation to the two I used to frequent in Scottsdale it's not that it's tiny just seems off for the area.

There's a lot of rock to get through to find out if this place is going to be a diamond in the rough.  I don't want to give this place any halo effect from  excellent concert we attended there. E.G.,  not  reviewing Roger Clyne  (5* btw:) )  but  the venue itself.   It's not finished, appears to  be poor on safety grounds ( really slow at removing piles of beer  from the cans  so many chances to stumble, / stick your foot in glass.  And the toilets are stuck somewhere around platorm 9 3/4. Luckily they had a guard posted with a light to show which door was the mens. ( yep  it's that unfinished)   Thankfully on the seriously hot ,for indoors, night the prices for the water / beer was reasonable. Crowd started to thin out well before the end so they are doing something seriously wrong here.   Oh hell they know what they did , more a warning to others to check out the current state of the place before you pay a lot of money to take a sauna with 1000 of your closest friends.   For a reflective barn it sounded good , ok the main act sounded good and I'd hate to think they shared the same sound guy because  it was night and day.  The extra cash for the "vip" area wasn't worth it it's higher up with worse AC than the main area and the seats were all taken way before we could get in.Upperbar  staff  were oblivious to our attempt to order so we joined the main floor and  had no trouble getting served in a reasonable amount of time.

After one of the worst breakfast experiences in my recent history  I made a point to try as many independent morning eateries as I could. The incident that drove me to this was thinking there was someway that Taco Bell's waffle taco could actually work on some level. Please don't  let the fact that I'm an idiot detract from the next part of the review.   Pesto Prima cafe  was a solid improvement at a fair price. Their English muffin with fried egg, Canadian ham ,tomato, cheese and basil aioli pesto was well constructed,  hot,tasty and the default coffee that came with it better than 2/3 of the usual breakfast places but not stand out great.    Friendly staff, clean and I hope to get a chance to get a lunch there in the near future

I'm not a huge beer guy, Cider is more my thing, after the Scotch,and rum, are gone but this place was worth taking a growler home from, then returning to get a refill.  The wings were really average , not bad, but the house hot, aren't  and were pretty small. Compared to the other appetizers hitting the table these were the red colored step-chickens of the family. E.G, the rest was great.   The poutine was excellent,  braised ribs, rich gravy and thick enough frys to support it, sure it could be a little more generous but,.. who am I kidding , I could eat that till I was carried out of the place. Maybe it's not authentic so I would happily be corrected if anyone could point me to a better source locally, that has beer. I think they are safe;)   On a non-food note. Not the most obvious entry into parking lot and their website hasn't caught up most people using mobile devices to access info when out.commits the menu on PDF sin

About 1530 on a weekday afternoon.    Appetizers, Review colored by the reheated wings that came out.  Skin tighter and drier than an aged truckstop lot lizard had them going back on the first bite.  I've eaten at four Oregano's in the valley and none of them tried to pass barely reheated wing. This was fixed by them making a new set, you know like the ones paid for.   The other order of BBQ wings were great  it's amazing what a bit of prior warning can do.   Brushchetta :  Crudely cut tomatoes, minimal to trace levels of garlic and basil on quite dry bread, had a look at menu and there's meant to be red onions in it too. It was just large tomatoes in oil.  Appearance , color is there,  bland, left most of it.   Main:    Kid's pasta bowl, fair price for the amount.    Pesto Penne Bake.  Like the problem dishes referred to above it it had the appearance but, green isn't a flavor, the chicken was dry, the garlic and onion once again  taking a back seat or missing the flight  entirely.  So unless you develop synthesia over lunch and begin to taste color it's not that great.   Lasagne. Solid as ever   Servers, great, no problems there, they don't make the food after all, and quickly corrected it, but the rating  really reflects the initial offering and in matters other than service this location fell far short of my prior outings with them.

The Goan vindaloo , finally I've left a new restaurant in the Phoenix area happy that , no one tried to warn me about the heat and two wasreally the best rendition of this dish I've had in years that I didn't make myself.  Sour, spicy with a great texture that sticks to the naan and rice which, at least for me, is just the perfect size for an evening curry.  Add in Naan a cut above those poor thin uniform excuses that are the feature of most valley buffets  and a decent appetizer section  and I can no longer claim there's not a decent Indian restaurant within 10 miles of the house.  Again this is just based on one dish but that's really all I need. I really wanted to try a bunch of the appetizers but I could see $40 lunch occurring and  that just wasn't a today thing.  Great service, bit pricey for  solo lunch dining and the tables for 2 , tiny,wee bit cramped, though not relevant at the time I was there.   The lunch menu is too restrictive ,the leap from lunch price to dinner will limit how much I could spend, but don't get me wrong this dish is worth the price,  but 1/2 the serving and a 1/2 naan for $10-12 would hit the sweet spot and make this a regular rather than occasional thing.

Way too slow, way too salty and enough to get me to break my long streak of not leaving poor reviews. .   One table when we arrived, people finishing up outside around 1930 on Thursday.  Food took a dog's age to arrive  approx 25 mins ( kids , love to wait, oh yes they do)     My poutine was awful,easily worst in the valley, and about as salty as this review.  To be  beaten by Food trucks and several bars may not be a disgrace but there are better offerings at ice rink restaurants within the valley. Not saying anything else on the menu is awful but that was the main reason this restaurant was chosen.      I  left it mostly uneaten which didn't raise a comment.  Barely any gravy, curds that couldn't squeak if you tried , fries  limp as all hell, I.E.,  Just vile phoning it in crap.   when people don't ask why you buy things to just sit on the table it suggests it's a known issue.    The kids fared better and really liked their waffle kid's meals which appeared reasonable value and came with a mountain of fries , insultingly bigger than the poutine for adults,but I digress. I didn't eat their food.   I just can't forsee another outing based on our being in Westgate is event based and if takes this long on a quiet non-event night I'd hate to imagine the lead time before a game.

There's no good reason to get a burrito from this place, I've never had a chode burrito, practically square, all the ingredients that had been layered now all over the place so each bite was strongly flavored with the ingredient in that pocket, next bit down different again.  The tortilla was, I'm sure papyrus, or maybe the dried-skin of a truck-stop lot-lizard but it wasn't that appetizing either. I was hoping for another Brushfire like experience but the idea of driving by Rolando's to eat here again, not happening.    Oh and it was barely warm enough to melt the cheese , the side order of the potato taco was cold , having sat the entire time the order was being made. You have to admire their commitment to running a business as if stoners called the shots though:)  Two reviews in a week?  Blame the water heater failing for this renewal of eating out:)
