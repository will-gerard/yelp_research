Great place to study, relax with a coffee and a book, or catch up with a friend over coffee.   The coffee is very good and they usually offer several varieties at once. The pastry's are very tasty and never stale.   The wi-fi is good and free, not super fast but certainly not slow.   It does get a bit loud in the main room at times. When that happens the bank vault turned study/work area is still pretty quiet.

Great pizza but the service's main goal seems to be to get you out of the restaurant as soon as possible. Definitely did not feel welcome.

Great brewery!  They have at least 8 of their own beers on tap and some really good guest beers as well, about 20 +.    FYI: They don't serve any food other than popcorn and snack mix. But, they allow you to have food delivered or to bring your own food in to the brewery.  I find that it is better and less expensive to bring my own food in (In-N-Out, Papa Johns, Thai-Rama, etc).

Great spot for some good coffee in Old Town Scottsdale.   The decor is clean and inviting and the coffee is great.  Good selection of drip coffees and some very tasty muffins available as well.

Great sushi rolls and Nigiri. The happy hour specials are great as well.

Not impressed. First, only certain theaters have service. You can order food and take it in but then you have to sit in the seat with a plate in your lap. Not very comfortable. Second, the food is mediocre at best. Tried the hummus and it had obviously been scooped out of a can with what was probably the last of a bag of pita chips. Lots of crumbs. Third, $7.50 for a 12 oz beer is ridiculous. Fourth, we couldn't take drinks into the theater because it is one that children are allowed into. This despite the fact that an R rated movie was playing.  Lastly, the seating is not clear. We entered a theatre during the previews and it was dark and somewhat crowded. We found the two seats together and sat down. But, a manager kicked us out of the seats because they were the special kind that you pay extra for. By this time, there were no other seats other than the second row. Pure digital or not, the picture sucked. They need to have someone to check the tickets of people who try to sit in the special seats. Overall, it was very disappointing.

Shithole. Not only are the drinks overpriced but they said they would have the PAC-12 championship game on and they didn't put it on. Assholes.  Skip this shithole!

What looked like a phenomenal French toast on the menu turned out to be nothing like the menu advertised. Slow inefficient service for brunch. Not impressed.

Great food, drinks, atmosphere, and service.  I've been to Salut several times and am always happy when I leave.  One improvement that could be made is the addition of entrees to the food menu.  The salads, sandwiches, and burgers are great but sometimes you want an entree instead.
