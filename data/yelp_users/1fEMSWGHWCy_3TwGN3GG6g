I've grown up in AZ and remember coming to Native New Yorker for a long time. There wings were always top notch and the tastiest around. Recently, it seems like they changed the recipe for the wings and they are no longer as good. It's almost like there is too much breading on them. The place is still a decent neighborhood joint but I think the quality of the food has dropped over the years.

If you haven't been here for a bagel, you're missing out. It a small shop with a big New York feel. Bagels and everything on their menu is top notch.

We come every weekend for breakfast and our dogs love to come because they typically get a dog treat at the take out window. The last three times the same woman didn't give a treat. The food is always good but we are driving home with with disappointed pups.
