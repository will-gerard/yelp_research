Great place!  And they deliver!  Ordered orange chicken and there actually was chicken instead of just breading like at Panda Express.  My spring rolls were cold but the did not hesitate to deliver us new hot ones when I called about them being cold.  Would definitely recommend!

I wanted to say that my experience with the company has been good.  I have rented one of Mark's clients properties for almost 2.5 years and they have been good with responding to issues and concerns.  Obviously he is going to work for ensuring his landlords properties are cared for which he definitely does with random property inspections but I do not mind as they always give adequate notice.  This is a good property management company to work with.  Thanks to Mark and his team!!

So I went to Cogburns last night to have a drink after working to check it out around 10PM.  My bar/grill of choice has typically been Native New Yorker, but Cogburns is so close that I wanted to see if this could be a good alternative for watching the UFC fights with my buddies.  When u went in the bartender was too preoccupied in her conversation with the one waitress there that I had to sit there for 15 minutes before I was acknowledged.  Once acknowledged she apologized because she did not see me...duh you were too busy not paying attention!  So I get a draft, finish it up and want to have one more before closing my tab.  Once again I sat there with an empty mug for another 10 minutes while I wait for her to finish her obviously intense conversation with her coworker.  I think the words customer service do not apply at this place.
