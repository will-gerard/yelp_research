I am always mad at myself after I eat at Texad Roadhouse because I get so carried away with the delicious appetizers that I never leave enough room for my entree or dessert! But it always makes for a satisfying leftover meal the next day :)  Totally delicious food. It's a tradition in my family to go here every time my parents come to visit. Great service, great environment, even better food. A+!

I was totally impressed by the owner (Rigo)'s enthusiasm and service. He makes the sandwiches taste better just by the way he makes you laugh! I have since referred at least a dozen of my friends to eat there, and I recommend you give it a try too!

I believe that Streets of New York is a chain, and I've certainly enjoyed my experience at other locations, but this one in particular was a bit of a disaster. The food was all right, but the service was slow and unfriendly. The waiters were borderline anti-social and another guy who seemed to be the owner or at least the manager wasn't much better.   If you're yearning for Streets of New York Pizza, try another location.

Found out about this business through Yelp and I decided to give it a shop. I was very satisfied! It wasn't too busy, but the food was good and the service was friendly. I ordered the chicken tacos and they were delicious. One of my co-workers had the steak tacos and said they were even better. The owner took special interest to come and talk with us (since they weren't too busy), and I would most definitely go there again.

Just ate here for the first time on Saturday and totally loved it. Some friends had been recommending it to us, and we had seen it driving by, but it wasn't until Saturday that we actually got out there. I was totally impressed by the atmosphere (we sat outside because the weather was nice and the scenery beautiful, but there is inside seating also). I had the bacon burger and it was delicious -- can't wait to go back!
