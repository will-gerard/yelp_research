Phoenix Ranch Market III is an absolute MUST for any person visiting Phoenix, Az. Forget the upscale breakfast and faux southwest shops that dot and line Scottsdale. Forget the 'burbs of Peoria, Goodyear, and East Mesa. Don't let your visiting family leave without making a trip down to the Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th st and Roosevelt. Yes, this is south of the I-10 freeway and far away from your faux mexican food at Macayo's Cantina. At Phoenix Ranch Market you'll find a side of the city that nearly all of the transplanted surburban population seems to want to ignore, or just completely forget. This is Phoenix being Phoenix, not Phoenix trying to be a new Los Angeles or anyplace else.  After having breakfast at a carbon copy brunch eggery, I was in need of something less perfect and faux. I found exactly what I was craving. When you can hear the sounds of mariachi or radio campesina from your car parked at the other end of a packed lot, you know this isn't the local Kroger you're about to enter.  Part grocery store, part food court, part village market, PRM is huge, it's overwhelming and it's surprisingly clean and comfortable - this isn't a low rent grocery like Food City. With a fresh seafood section two or three times the size you'd find anywhere else in Phoenix, and with parts of animals you've probably never prepared at home, it's fun to just look, but even more fun to buy. Want meat? Want better options? Better cuts? Want an entire skinned cow's head with the eyes intact and staring at you? Check. It's all SO GOOD.  But that's just the meats. They make their own tortillas onsite with a literal factory and small army of workers churning out the flat corn and flour awesomeness. Hungry? Want mexican food? Want great mexican food? ALWAYS consider going here. Think of anything on a restaurant menu and you have it here. Prepared fresh, and a la carte. Seriously. Tamales of any kind. Horchata! Cow Tongue! Burritos of immense size and stuffed with anything you want. Some of the best beans in town, rice, and parts from a pig that still actually look like parts from a pig. This isn't the mall food court.  The place is packed with mostly hispanic families but you'll also notice a few adventurous types, including my asian self. Most of the employees speak english very well so language is not a barrier. The only times you'll need help is when asking what is that? And like mentioned above, the answer just might be cow tongue (which by the way, is good, however I can see how the texture would turn some people off. Imagine a soft almost too mushy beef...)  Oh. The food is also cheap. You'll get more than full off of $5, you'll explode at $10. It's seriously like heaven here. Music, people, atmosphere, food, drinks, desserts, baked goods. All of it awesome. I met up with my friend Amy.The.Kidd for 'lunch' and we ended up spending almost 4 hours just walking around, back and forth, trying each new item we found, or trying the standards but knowing they were going to be better here. Mmmm. Horchata, great corn tamales, rice, beans, empanadas, warm fresh tortillas... bring everyone. This is a place that should be in people's minds when they think of Phoenix, not just the golf courses, or upscale Scottsdale, or Frat/Sorority Tempe... but South Phoenix. No matter how scary it is for suburban soccer moms to venture down there.  Phoenix Ranch Market on 16th St and Roosevelt. Take me anytime.

What's that you say? You live in Phoenix, Arizona and you're tired of having breakfast at the Cracker Barrel, or Denny's, or even Ihop? What about those 'eggeries' they have around town? Nope? Not in the mood? Oh. You know where you should go? You want a completely different breakfast experience in Phoenix than the usual stuff you can find out in Goodyear, or Peoria, or Mesa?  Go to La Grande Orange. (pronounced Oh-rahnj) Seriously. While more than half the spots in Atlanta would rival La Grande Orange, in Phoenix it's absolutely hands down one of the top three spots for breakfast. Honest.  Okay. So the parking lot is too small for how many people come for breakfast. This isn't LGO's fault, there's actually a lot of parking - there are just too many people coming for breakfast. Okay. So the prices are technically a little more than you're used to paying by about $2. Get over it. The food is better. Well, okay, there's only one item on the breakfast menu that's actually worth the money. The Commuter Sandwich - but it's worth the money.  Using the largest, most flavorful and softest english muffins you can find, they place very fluffy folded eggs in a sandwich along with avocado, and bacon, or turkey or whatever else you'd like. Seriously, the english muffin alone with the egg is enough to make this worth the price of admission.  Sure the lines get long, but I'm sorry, that's what happens when the locals know a good thing - and it's the locals, the people who live in and around the Arcadia district that come here most often. Sit outside or inside, there's enough traffic to people watch while drinking your latte and eating your sandwich.  While you're waiting for your food to arrive, walk around the store and check out all of the french imports that you really can't get anywhere else. I'm not saying they're actually worth the price, but there are a few greatly unique items which you may decide are definitely worth the price. My girlfriend bought a $25 wallet there which she still uses and gets complimented on everytime she pulls it out of her purse. (Okay I know, $25 for a woman's wallet is nothing, but you should see this wallet.)  They also have a selection of wines and cheeses. I've never bought either and I'm not sure they're worth the markup they have on everything at LGO, but it's nice to see, especially after you've wandered one too many times around the Cracker Barrel store.  There's an attached pizzeria which isn't open during breakfast hours, but you can sit in their space when you get your commuter sandwich and coffee. It's quite awesome. La Grande Orange is honestly a hidden jewel in the Phoenix suburban food wasteland. It's not for everyone, but I'd say that if you're in your mid 20's to early 40's even, and you're wanting to seem a bit trendy without trying too hard, go here. You'll definitely appreciate the difference.

There are sushi snobs everywhere. Sushi in Phoenix? Ha. At least that's what I used to think. Sure it's easy to look down on everyone who thinks they've had good sushi after eating at Ra, or Zen 32 - but forgive them, this is Phoenix and they're still learning about sushi and that's okay.  When they're done having bad california rolls and a happy hour menu full of pieces that fall apart, take them to Sakana in Scottsdale. I know, I said Scottsdale but don't let that turn you away. Sakana is away from the cheesy old town and located in a non-descript strip mall on Hayden just east of Scottsdale Rd. You won't be disappointed. In fact, you'll be surprised at how awesomely fresh, clean and flat out delicious your food will be.  If it's just you and a friend, I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar and not only watch the sushi chefs work, but actually talk with them. While there are a few who would prefer not to say anything, there is usually at least one who's up for anything and definitely up for you buying them a cup of saki.  The lunch and happy hour specials are excellent here. Order lots and try everything eventually. It's all good.  We used to live deep in Phoenix at 36th st & McDowell and we'd make the trek to Sakana simply because anything else was bound to be sub-par. Sure Zen32 was practically in our front yard, but we'd simply keep driving.  The ambiance is everything you'd expect for being in Scottsdale except you'll notice that families come here. You'll see groups of friends both old and young eating and drinking - all without the pretense you'll find down in Old Town. This isn't the sushi restaurant to be seen, this is where you go if you want the best sushi you can find in all of Phoenix.  If you grew up and Phoenix and the first time you had sushi was during a Zen32 happy hour, graduate and get over to Sakana in Scottsdale.

Buca Di Beppo is literally, italian restaurant hell. You know how all big box chain restaurants throw junk up on the walls in an attempt to make the space feel vintage? Buca Di Beppo throws junk, and knick knacks and statues and anything else 'italian' they could find in the chinese warehouse where they loaded up these goods. It's a terrible horrible mess and you end up sitting in a yardsale of italian paraphenalia while eating your very bland pasta.   It's embarassing how truly flavorless the food is here. Thin, flavorless alfredo sauce. Thick slabs of lasagna with less taste than what I can get out of the frozen section at Publix. I went with a large group and across the table, bland food.  When they seat your party, they guide you through the kitchen area where the cooks play along and say a welcoming hello. Deep down you know they hate this. Why are we in the kitchen? Sure it's nice, but I'd rather have them concentrating on making the food, and making it good. Of course, the food at Buca Di Beppo seems to be far beyond any point of return to tasting good. It's just dead. Dead food. No life, no flavor, not emotion. I get more flavor from the $.99 Michelina's frozen lunch package.  Far from claiming anything authentic Italian, Buca Di Beppo even pumps out bread with no taste. Eating at Buca is like eating food from an assisted living facility. No salt, no sugar, no butter, no fat, it's all gone along with anything resembling taste. Sure, Buca has huge portions, and the setup is nice for large parties and families - but they might as well just buy the family-size pasta packs from the frozen section and bake it at home, even that would be better, and they wouldn't have to the mandatory gratuity. Say what you will about other italian chains like Macaroni Grill, or Olive Garden - at least their food taste like something.

My Florist Cafe is misunderstood - by nearly everyone. Living in Phoenix you get used to how things are. If you own a food spot, it's either a coffee shop, a bar, or restaurant. Much like the clear zoning lines between residential and commercial, Phoenix food spots are either this or that, and rarely allowed to be anything else - it would be too confusing.   So while the complaints about My Florist cover a variety of subjects from the lousy menu, the lousy food, and the lousy service, it's only compounded by the fact that when you enter My Florist, you're expecting to enter an actual restaurant. Someplace you can get hot food, drinks and listen to jazz music while sitting there pretending you're in a completely different city. One that's more metropolitan, one that's more urban and cool, one that doesn't shut down at 10 o'clock.  My Florist Cafe fails, consistently and miserably. Oddly, years of bad service, bad food, and surprisingly boring bread haven't stopped people from giving this place a chance. Over and over again.  Sure they have one of the best jazz pianists in all of Phoenix (at least that you can find easily without having to be in any sort of music circles), but is that really enough? With the servers dressed up, disappearing regularly and delivering plates full of hard, nearly unedible bread, while having no knowledge at all about any of the wines they're suggesting, why do people continue to frequent this place?  I think our expectations are too high. Take away the bad service, don't expect too much out of the food, disregard any of the servers suggestions regarding wine and what do you have? Probably one of the more unique atmospheres you can find in Phoenix. For the price and the location, there really isn't anything like the ambiance you'll get at My Florist Cafe.  With an upscale decor, enough tables to comfortably fit a small group, the jazz piano in the background and the hum of coversation filling the room, I would dare say that there isn't anything like this anywhere else in Phoenix. Sure there are different places to go such as Chez Nous, but comparing the two would be wrong. Where Chez Nous is a great, dark, soulful R&B lounge, My Florists is excellently open and bright.  However, in the end My Florist Cafe has spent years and years unchanged. You can only say a restaurant could be so much more for so long. After a while, you decide to give up on it. You decide that it really won't change. You decide that for some unknown reason, the servers are different every week and so are their managers - but at least the woman playing piano can generally be counted on.  My advice? Try My Florist once a year. Don't order any food, and definitely don't order any bread. Bring some friends, order a bottle of wine of your own choosing, not the server's suggestions, and have a great time in one of Phoenix's few unique cafes.

Ask for a real Irish Pub in Phoenix and you might as well ask for real italian food in Phoenix. Look, it's just not going to happen. Luckily, that means that people will still try and some will come close - but who cares? Rosie McCaffrey's Irish Pub is easily one of the top three 'irish' pubs in Phoenix. However, what makes Rosie's better is that it lets go of trying to be something that it couldn't possibly achieve. That authentic irish pub, or even one close to those that you'll find in Chicago, or New York. Again, that's okay. Unlike the George & Dragon which absolutely holds onto it's attempt at being authentically british, Rosie's is closer to actually being an Irish Pub deep in the heart of desert Phoenix.   I've had many, many great nights with friends in the booths at Rosie McCaffrey's. Come with a good group of friends, when the place is packed and the band plays on the insanely small stage - and you're set for a great time. The fish and chips with vinegar are more than decent and often actually deserve whatever award they claim to have recieved. The beer flows and they have the appropriate options on draught. But none of that stuff really matters.  You can recreate the exact same bar anywhere. You can use the same wood, the same bar, have the same drinks on tap, and none of it matters if your crowd sucks. This is where Rosie's excels. The crowd. The people who frequent. Since it's deep in Phoenix, yet a little off center, Rosie's doesn't attract the annoying Tempe college crowd. It doesn't attract the annoying Scottsdale upper-class pretenders. The people who go to Rosie's actually live in Phoenix. These are hard working middle class city dwellers looking for a neighborhood bar to share a great time with friends - and drink - truly without the pretentiousness so often found everywhere else even remotely popular.  As far as irish pubs in Phoenix go, Rosie's is top three - but only because they regularly have some of the best crowds. Sure, every now and then you feel like pretending to be someone else and you make your way to Scottsdale (or you feel like pretending to be someone else everynight) but when you just want to be yourself with your friends, and have a great time, not just a good time, Rosie McCaffrey's is the place to go. So drink up, talk to everyone you want to, heck, start a brawl even, it's an irish pub right?
