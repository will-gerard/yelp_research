Made a reservation for Valentine's Day at 7:30pm. Arrived promptly at 7:30 and the place was very busy, which I expected. The restaurant had a very warm and welcoming feeling despite the chaos. However, I was not greeted for some time once I got inside. I had to flag a woman down to let her know I had arrived. After this I still waited about 15 minutes before being seated. I'm very patient and I know that Valentine's Day is a hectic time for restaurants so I didn't mind. I was just excited to have a nice dinner with my wife. This was to be our first Valentine's Day since being married and due to our work, we rarely get to spend that day together. After being seated we waited. And waited. After 10 minutes a bus boy came to deliver water. No servers came to the table. 10 more minutes go by, our bus boy comes again to refill waters. The very busy staff seemed to have forgotten us. We waited a total of 25 minutes and no one came to wait on us. We walked out. The lady who checked us in for the reservation chased us into the parking lot and after explaining what happened she tried to get us to come back in but we politely declined. We ordered some dominos pizza and wings and had a very nice Valentines Day dinner on the couch.

Absolutely phenomenal pizza. This place has been right down the street from my home for years and I finally got around to trying it. I can't believe I waited so long. Spinato's pizza is very very good. I got delivery so I couldn't say anything about the dinning experience but their product is fantastic. After just one pizza (the Chicago), I can safely say Spinato's is now my go to pizza delivery joint in my neighborhood. I look forward to trying the dine-in experience as well.

This place has become our new favorite Chinese delivery. Their food is delicious and reasonably priced and with one exception, their deliveries have been very prompt. The wings are amazing, the chicken fried rice has lots of chicken, everything we've tried has been fantastic! If you're looking for a good Chinese delivery spot in this area, Dragon Bowl is great.

Went in for a simple battery purchase and swap. Prices were very reasonable. I was quoted 45-60 minutes for them to replace the battery. I drove away from the garage 14 minutes after I walked in the front door. It was a very pleasant experience and I appreciated the fact that they really hustled to take care of the replacement quickly. This was one of the best experiences I've had getting any kind of service on my car.

I came here on my lunch break hoping to discover a new option to add to my rotation. Excluding drive time, I only have about 40 minutes to eat lunch if I go out. I went to House of Yangs and spent 25 minutes waiting and 15 minutes eating. About 6 people got their food before I did. Once I got my food, it was decent but nothing outstanding. Mongolian beef was tasty but the sides did nothing for me. Not a terrible experience but not exactly a good one either. At least it was cheap. Though I may give it a shot again in the future, I am in no rush.

Easily one of my favorite places in the Phoenix area to eat and drink. I've had a variety of their sandwiches and every one of them has been excellent. The Arizona chicken rolls are an appetizer that can't be missed. They have a wide variety of beers brewed in house so they are always fresh. The atmosphere is welcoming and energetic. This is a great place to catch a sporting event or bring larger groups. The venue usually plays host to a college town crowd and is usually busy but never overwhelming. Service is usually very good. If friends are visiting from out of town, this is where we will go every time. Four Peaks is a Phoenix area staple as far as I am concerned.

Went on a weekday evening and the place was full but not uncomfortable. We had to wait a few minutes for a table because we wanted to sit outside but the wait was reasonable. I'm usually determined to find the least healthy item at places that otherwise would offer some very healthy choices. So I ordered a Philly Cheesesteak pita and wasn't disappointed. Get some hummus before the meal, you won't regret it. The service was very good and the prices were reasonable.

I received excellent service getting new tires here. I was greeted immediately upon entering and I was helped out by Mike. He was very friendly, helpful and answered all my questions. Took about 30 minutes to have my tires replaced which was very reasonable.

I've only been once but it made quite an impression on me. I had the Sonoran burger which is made with cheese and green peppers grilled inside the patty. The burger was delicious and the place had a neat vibe to it, though the service did leave something to be desired. Overall, it was a very good experience.

Without a doubt this is my favorite ice cream place in the Phoenix area. I just recently discovered it and liked it so much I came back the following day. Apparently they rotate through different flavors each week. Get the cookies & mint if its available.

DO NOT TRUST THIS BUSINESS WITH YOUR MONEY. I placed an order with Mr. Cooks Chinese Cuisine over 90 minutes ago and it still has not been delivered. I called and the first time I was told it was out for delivery. I waited 15 more minutes and I called again two more times. At this point the restaurant is closed and no one answered my second or third call. I am extremely upset and very hungry.
