Why does everyone rate this airport so low? I don't think it's fair to judge typical airport issues for one particular airport. That's traveling. Get there early and be patient!   I love that this airport keeps improving. With the addition of many local Phoenix culinary favorites and free wifi, I'd never be bored or unhappy here! Also I rode the shiny new Sky Train the other day and it was cool. I know other airports have this too, no big deal, but I have watched it being built and it's nice to see all of their hard work finally completed.   Restaurants to try: Chelsea's Kitchen, Barrio Cafe, La Grande Orange, Cowboy Ciao and Olive & Ivy if you want to experience a little Phoenix flavor without leaving the airport.   Another thing I love about this place is the art on display throughout the facility. Beautiful!

By far my favorite place to hike. The terrain is not terribly difficult which is better for me and my dog to dominate the trails! It's quiet and beautiful here. I love the sundial at the top which points out views to key places like ASU and downtown Phoenix. This park is huge so get a map if  you are exploring new trails for the first time.

I was lucky enough to come here with a large group of friends and family members to race Corvettes and go-karts. I have loved Corvettes for a long time and this was the first time I got to actually ride in one, but HELLO I got to drive it, as well! What an experience! I felt like Danica Patrick. The go-karts were a little more scary, but maybe I just had too much competition. Yea that's it! I was one of two girls and there were like 10 guys with us. But it seriously was such a fun day. If you get a chance to go, don't hesitate! Hit the gas pedal and go!

I attended Archery Day in early December with the Arizona Game and Fish Department and I really enjoyed it. For my birthday, I wanted to go shoot archery for a bit and my boss found this place in Chandler that offers individual and group classes, which was perfect because my staff needed a few tips before letting loose all Hunger Games style on the targets!   Brett, the manager, gave us a crash course in safety and helped us select either a compound or recurve bow. He made some adjustments to the bows to fit each one of us and he watched our form to make sure we on the right path to hitting some bullseyes! It was fun to see who turned out to be pretty decent archers! I still need some practice, but my boss and co-worker were both improving and hit the gold (bullseye) many times.   Toward the end of our session, Brett has us play a game of "HORSE" with the word ARROW, and so we tried to match each others shots, calling the shots from across the room, diagonal and from a really far distance. It ended in a shoot out with me and a friend. It was really fun and I'd like to sign up for more archery classes with Brett! Thanks!

The French toast bagel is delicious! Even when I was trying to avoid ordering a pastry or cookie, I decided on this gem instead. It satisfied my sweet tooth! I like to sit here and get some work done after a snack. I did bring my boyfriend a steak panini and he didn't like it. Not sure what he disliked about it, but at least it came with a cookie!

Picture a small family kitchen in Old Italy and classic meals with their own secret ingredients and you'll have the menu at Giuseppe's.   This place was a suggestion from a new client when we were in his neck of the woods. We are starving after meeting and brainstorming lunch ideas when he mentioned this little Italian restaurant. My boss's eyes lit up and it was decided. I ordered stuffed peppers for lunch and it was deliciso. Lunch came with a side of Italian bread and homemade butter.   If you love Italian food, put Giuseppe's Ristorante on your must-try list!

I am a recent college graduate who was really poor throughout school. I always shopped at Walmart or Safeway for groceries in the past. Now that I live directly across from Whole Foods, I decided to stop in for a few ingredients the other day. I was blown away by the quality of the food and as I walked around, the whole store smelled fresh, making my mouth water. I still have to watch how much I buy, because this place is pricey. I get it that quality products are expensive and I plan to come back when I need a good cheese, bottle of wine, or tasty steak.   Great. Now I'm hungry again!

Bomb.com!! I love Dilly's and just about everything on their menu. Some of my favorites are the Yahoo, Southwest Wrap, Sweet Leaf Turkey Wrap, Sweet Leaf Salad with Chicken, Blazin' Buffalo, Smokey Mountain, The Gobbler or any of their amazing hearty soups in a bread bowl! YUM! See I told you I love the whole menu!! I think I fell in love with Dilly's the first time I tried it! I'm lucky there has always a Dilly's location close to me. One of Arizona's local gems, in my opinion. Believe me, if you are having lunch with a friend and you don't know where to go, just go to Dilly's! They are pretty packed at lunch time for this reason, but I think they also allow call ahead or to-go orders.   Oh yeah, I'm obsessed with their Focaccia bread. That is all.

Outback is a great restaurant. You can count on the tasty food and good service. They are reasonably priced and consistently deliver a quality product. This location gets busy during dinner time, but I've always had a good experience.

I really like living at CityScape at Lakeshore Apartment Homes. The community is well-kept and the staff are very friendly and professional. The maintenance crew works really hard to quickly get repairs completed. The gym and pool are also nice features. I must say that I would like this place much better if there were at least two pools. The kids TAKE OVER the pool here and it's not so fun for those of us not ready to have yelling and screaming kids running around their life. I wish there was a kiddie pool or at least more than one pool so you could choose one or the other. The parking lot is also somewhat cramped, it seems pretty narrow for larger vehicles- trucks, Uhauls, campers, etc. Also the painting crew has taken up like 7 of the empty spots for the last few months. It just makes it all that much more difficult to find a parking spot. Like I said I like living here, but if anything these are a few suggestions that I could offer for a better living experience. Thanks!

"You don't need new tires." The best sentence I ever heard! Although I was prepared to buy new ones for my truck, when Britt said I was still fine, I felt relieved. And they repaired my flat tire, mounted it back on and put away my spare for free! All of which would not have been easy for me! Those tires are heavy. Thanks so much guys! I'll be back when my tires are beat.

I tried to call in a to-go order here. I tried calling five times it never was answered so I drove to Denny's to place my to-go order in person and now that I'm here waiting for it outside I see the general manager outside smoking a cigarette just about the whole time I've been waiting for my to-go order. Good luck with a manager like that.

I tried out Nello's for the first time the other day. I ordered a salad trying to stick to eating healthy. It was huge- even for a half salad! And the ingredients were super fresh and tasty. I thought the place was casual and inviting with friendly staff. The food smells so good, too! I'll have to try to pizza next time!

A neat store in Arizona Mills Mall. They have a lot of Buddha inspired trinkets. Good for small gifts for friends. They also have jewelry, beads, wall hangings, carvings, etc. I can waste a good half hour in this store for sure!

Great selection. The first time I went in I was very overwhelmed. I hadn't been crafty in years and I didn't know how the store worked. I later went back with an artist friend and she carried around a little basket to put her treasures in. I think they do a pretty good job of keeping beads organized. Pricing is sometimes hard to determine if you find something out of place. I feel beads are a little bit pricey. Whoever thought crafting was cheaper was wrong, but it's more fun and the only way to create an original piece of jewelry.

Well this place could definitely use a facelift. The service was super slow and unmemorable. At least the food was pretty good, but I can think of a handful of other family owned Mexican restaurants that are much better. My boyfriend didn't like his meal of a taco and chile relleno, I believe. Glad I gave it a try, but probably won't be back.

Definitely good for the outdoorsy type. Last time I walked in, I saw a golden retriever being fitted for a doggie backpack by a staff member. It was cute! I was looking for bike gear and someone offered some knowledge about bike lights and reflective gear. I almost bought the wrong color reflectors for the back of my bike. I was going to buy yellow stickers for the back, when red is to signal the rear of a cyclist. Thanks for saving me on that one! They do seem to get busy, but every time I have been there someone has tried to help me. Prices are kinda high, though. I have been tempted to sign up for the rewards plan.

Racks full of costumes. The perfect place for Halloween accessories. They even had a sale rack. Which is good because most fully decked out costumes aren't cheap. Cool stuff for theme parties also.

I have used the office center a few times for printing work collateral. The prices are a little high and the staff doesn't seem real motivated to assist customers quickly or with a smile. It seems like we are bothering them. I just have experienced this more than twice and thought maybe it was something worth mentioning.   When I have shopped in the area retail area of this store, I've not had a problem with customer service, friendliness or willingness to assist.

This is a great alternative to an expensive massage. Massage therapy students learn by practicing massage in the weekend clinics open to the public. I have been here about five or six times. I love to get an hour long, relaxing massage for just $25. Some students' skills are better than others, but they appreciate tips so they can improve. Each massage therapist has been very professional and made me feel comfortable in what could be an awkward situation. One negative is that they get very busy and clients could wait for awhile. If you happen to go on a 'buy one, get one free' coupon weekend, be prepared to wait for an hour or two.

This review is based on an event I attended here. I did not stay at the hotel as a guest or experience the bar. I was a guest at the Etiquette Dinner put on by ASU and affiliates. From the moment I entered the hotel, I felt welcomed. Each employee I passed greeted me with a smile and professionality. I thought the hotel interior was really cool also. When I was leaving the event, I thought how strange that locals never frequent hotels in their cities. I should try it!

I always look forward to river trips in the summer. It's a great way to hang out with friends, have some drinks, get a tan, and cause a little trouble. Obviously some people cause more trouble than others and the police are visible in certain areas of the river so keep an eye out. It can also be dangerous with people being drunk and rowdy and even a few drownings have occurred, so if you are not comfortable with this type of atmosphere, this might not be for you. Also, the water is not the cleanest river you have seen in your life (wouldn't recommend wearing white or anything that you would be upset about losing or getting messed up), but the scenery is beautiful and I've seen wild horses along the river a few times.   Personally, I think it's a great time. Over the last few summers, I have learned a few good pointers. Make sure to wear sunscreen, drink water (as well as beer), bring food and marshmellows, and put important items like keys in a ziplock bag and somewhere safe. Also, leave your phone in the car! In the event, you loose your keys, a locksmith is on duty in the parking lot of the tubing area. Make sure you have a designated driver because the police will not hesitate to pull you over once leaving the parking lot. Don't chance it.  As for the tubes, you can rent them with your ID and $15. You might want an extra tube for your cooler. Bring a rope to tie your group together because there are some rapids that could separate your group. If you plan to become a river rat, you might want to buy your own tube. I like to bring oars also to help with steering.

The Palms Theatre is back! And ready to impress. I went to the Opening Night of Menopause the Musical and felt myself dancing along in my chair to the catchy tunes. This story follows four women's journey's through the changes of menopause. The actresses were excellent! They all four had beautiful singing voices and nailed their parts! There's the business woman, a soap opera star, a hippie love child and an Iowa housewife who can all bond over hot flashes and forgetfulness, all while dancing and singing inside a Bloomingdales.   I wish my mom lived in Arizona because I'm sure she would have really enjoyed it. They also have dinner with a salad bar and hot meal options. Don't forget a chocolately brownie or apple pie for dessert! They also have beer, wine and cocktails. Don't forget to tip your servers!   Menopause runs now through Nov. 23rd.

Great local gem of Tempe. This place is welcoming to all. I always have a good time relaxing at the bar with a Peach Ale. I like that they brew seasonal beers like the Pumpkin Porter also. The food is good, not the healthiest spot around, but good bar food. This location gets pretty busy, but the staff is able to handle it.

I'm in love with the Sweet Potato Roll and Dragon Roll! They have pretty decent prices during happy hour. Service at the tables is sometimes slow.. I like to sit at the sushi counter. They usually have pretty interesting specialty rolls on the specials board. I've seen an ASU Roll and others that sounded cool.   Happy dining. Kampai!

Great neighborhood liquor store, friendly employees and excellent selection.  I like that you can buy a can of one type of beer before having to commit to the whole 6 or 12 pack. That helps me to try new beers that I might not have otherwise.

This used to be my favorite place to get some beer or whatever my kitchen was lacking. I am now changing my opinion. Starting with the fact that they are very overpriced in a college town. I spend $20 on two 6-packs. Well the worst part was that one of the 6-packs was stale, skunk, whatever you want to call it, but GROSS! I drank one and thought something was weird. Well after one sip of the second beer, I knew it was nasty. So the next day I went back hoping to simply exchange the sixer for one that was fresh. The man working gave me strange looks and never apologized. He said well that's the born on date. OK. I understand that, but what I am saying is that I drank this beer and it tasted like dirt. Granted it's the same brand of beer I always drink and I've shopped at T's many, many times. I did not appreciate his unwillingness to help me. After I spent enough money to justify going to a happy hour on beer, I would hope that a customer service oriented person would at least say, "That's weird, man I'm sorry- let me get you a different one". Needless to say, but I will anyways- I left the remaining beers on his counter and will not return.

Pita Jungle is a fresh change from the fried food scenery. When I'm in the mood for something healthy and unique, I like to go to lunch at Pita Jungle. Getting there is not the hard part, it's deciding what to order! I love so many things on the menu including the chicken pita and tzatziki with hummus or a delicious salad. Also, the new potatoes are amazing!!!  I like how the staff is free to be themselves at work and don't have to dress in a uniform. The servers seem to be happy and able to walk around in their own stylish, comfortable clothes.   One downside, they don't have much in the way of a bar. I ordered a sangria and it was meh. So I'll stick to a nice tea or lemonade next time.

This venue books a ton of great music. I have been here over 20 times and I think that is an understatement. I don't have as much money to spend on concert tickets and beer now that I am back in college and don't work as much. This is the best local venue in Tempe and they know it. The staff is cocky and somewhat rough around the edges, but they have to be to keep the large auditorium of people under control. I recommend taking the light rail to this event, there are two stops really close by. I like to ride my bike there because parking sometimes fills up unless they also have access to the parking garage across the street for that show. They charge for parking so bring some cash. Rock on!

Only applies to mini golf, as I haven't tried the other attractions. I've been to the miniature golf course probably 4 or 5 times. What can I say? I like me some mini golf! Reminds me of Ocean City, MD where I spent many of my summers as a kid!   Anyways, there are two mini golf courses of 19 holes each. One is the Lost Dutchman and I forget the exact name of the other one, but it has to do with a Princess. Both are rather elaborate with obstacles and props to correspond with the theme. Watch out for the windmill and loop-de-loop. I had some trouble with them and racked up a few etra strokes trying to finish the hole. :) I also ended up with my ball in the water once or twice, but I like to keep the game interesting!   I like to go to this location around sunset like between 6 -7 p.m. The view is very pretty with an orange streaked show passing through the sky. Once it becomes dark, the course becomes more vibrant as colored lights and large white spotlights turn on, so you can play in the dark.   Good for a small group of people. More than 4 or 5 would seem to take too long for each person to finish. I think 2 -4 would be the perfect group size. Also, bring water with you because it gets pretty hot. I think the vending machines are expensive. The mini golf itself is not very expensive, but I think they get you with food, rides, arcade games, etc. located inside.

A mix between a convenience store with everything you could possibly need and a retail shop stocked with ASU gear. I met the owner, Mike Jennings and he says he tries his best to keep the prices low. Great tactic for repeat customers. They have drinks and snacks if  you're in a hurry. I like the selection of ASU gifts and apparel. They've got it all!

Delicious as always. Don't get delivery unless you have no other option- just go pick it up, they get super busy at lunch. If you ask for no onions you are probably still getting onions. They have awesome soups, but they tend to run out of the best ones after lunch. One of my favorite places to go for sandwiches in Tempe! (They have other locations, too!)

This place is good for local and fast Mexican food. Better than Macayo's or Filiberto's. The atmosphere is relaxing and I like that they have daily specials. There is an interesting story behind Rosita's. Mama Rosa opened the first restaurant in the 60s and it was very small with only four tables. Now it's much bigger and they still use her recipes. Yum! Now I want a chimichanga.

Much better than I remember since they reopened. I have been in for lunch a few times recently. The service has been much better and that point is illustrated by the fact that it's not always dead in there anymore (prior to the fire it seemed like it was headed downhill). I've worked at many restaurants in Tempe and it can be hard to get people in for lunch, but they have been busier and I think that's great!   I tried a summer shrimp salad, the chicken pita and hummus. All were very good. Especially the salad!!!!! YUM :)

This bike shop has a large selection of bikes. In my opinion, they have the best selection of different types of bikes and accessories. When I was looking to buy a bike, I searched all over town at many bike shops, sporting good stores, and even Target and Walmart. Some of the other bike shops were also called Tempe Bicycle and might all be owned by the same person. I felt this location was larger and had a few extra employees around to help out the rush of new college students to Tempe. I needed to buy locking lug nuts for my tires and they were out of stock, but an employee came over to help when I looked lost. He helped me find an alternative way to lock my tires. I would recommend buying a good U- lock and to be cautious of where you park your bike. My tires were stolen off of my bike at a light rail stop near campus. The employee that helped me said this is very common. This shop is some what on the more expensive side, but I feel that most bike shops in town were pricey.

I am not a mechanically inclined person. I have no idea how to fix anything wrong with a car. So this is what happened. My truck failed an emissions test for the gas cap. It was a cold, rainy day. On my way home I saw this Pep Boys and decided to take care of the gas cap problem right away. Their customer service was terrible. They asked me if I needed help and I told them what I needed only to be ignored for about ten minutes while the employees stood there socializing. So I really just wanted to leave. They got me the gas cap like 15 mins later. I declined when they asked if I wanted them to help. Thankfully I could say- no thanks it's raining. I'll just do it tomorrow.   They didn't act professional at all. Go elsewhere!

Driver had a really bad attitude. The apartment number was wrong and she asked "Sooo did you just enter it wrong or what?" Then she kept me on the phone without talking while she trudged over to my apartment. I apologized for the mix up and she said nothing. The most interaction she had with me at the door, was to ask if this was my credit card?  I still tipped her because I've been a server before, but thinking back maybe I should not have. I would never have been so rude to a customer. The pizza tasted pretty good, but I already had a bad taste in my mouth. Next time I will order from Papa John's or one of the 10 other pizza places near ASU.

I must start this by saying I am spoiled. Ever since I moved to Tempe in 2008, I lived super close to Tempe Town Lake. I was in love with running at that park, but now I live on the south end of Tempe and TTL is really not convenient in the morning rush hour traffic. Once I discovered that Kiwanis was basically my "down the road neighbor," I have been going regularly. I love to run in the mornings with my dog before the weather gets too hot for him. I think Kiwanis may just be his new favorite place because he loves to chase ducks! This park, while much smaller than TTL, has a ton of ducks, fish, turtles and other types of birds that call the lake their home. You see people with nets and fishing poles out there fishing all times of the day. There is also a huge playground for kids, many pavilions and grills for family get togethers and sometimes they play a movie on a big projection screen in the park. If you're an outdoorsy person, definitely check out Kiwanis Park!

I know that I've had Tom's BBQ before. I've seen them at events, but this was the first time I went inside to eat. We walked right in at lunchtime, but it wasn't too overly busy. There were people there enjoying the BBQ, but it was calm, relaxed and the food didn't take long. Most places are much more hectic during lunch. Billy was so friendly! We loved the BBQ and Chicago feel in Arizona. She also let us try some fried mac n cheese. YUM! I loved it and would have probably not known to order it as a side on my own. Thanks so much!!

I was apprehensive to begin with, but it's a newer looking restaurant so I gave it a try. I guess it was a bad idea. The food was old and lacked taste. Old chicken becomes very chewy and I just gave up without finishing my meal. I wish I could say the few bites I did have were worth the calories, but it was not the case.

I'm new to using the Cartwheel app for clearance items so I told the cashier Charlene that I wasn't sure how to use it and asked her if she could help me. She takes it from me and said it's not working maybe you can come back later. I just wonder why she doesn't know how to use this if this and you want customers to use this app, but the cashier doesn't know how to use it either. There's customers piling up in line behind me and the first person behind me is another target employee and I asked if he knows how to help her and he said I'm on lunch and puts his hands up in the air. She calls a manager and says maybe you can help her because I'm not really good at helping people. I'm really glad that I got top level customer service from this Target location.

Decided to take a break from Chipotle and check out this local chain. We got a few different burritos and tacos. I'm a sucker for good Mexican and this was pretty darn good. I mean it's semi-fast foodesque, but not so much as Filiberto's.   I've only had my meals to go, so I can't comment on the dining experience, but the staff has been helpful and I like it when they include lots of sauces! Arrriba!

Ohhh the MGM. Large and green, it stands out as a destination on the Las Vegas Strip. I recently stayed here for 3 nights and had a great experience from the time I walked in the door. All of the employees were very friendly and helpful. I was seriously impressed with how professional everyone was. That's one of the main reasons I gave them 5 stars. I felt like everything I needed was taken care of. My room was newly remodeled in lovely modern decor. I did wish they had a balcony, but I know that's not very common in Las Vegas. It also would have been nice to have a separate mini fridge (besides the minibar) for food I wanted to eat later. I suppose I should have asked about that. The bed was amazing! I got the best sleep I possibly could, while in Vegas. If only I had a bed like that at home!! But for some reason the casino and hallways were always freezing. I'm from Phoenix, I can't handle that!   I also loved the pool. It was huge with a lazy river, volleyball and waterfall pools all packed full of people having a good time. I went two days in a row and never wanted to leave!   They also were so nice to hold my bags when I checked out and had some time to kill before heading to the airport. (Super close to the airport which is a plus!)  Overall I really had a good time staying at the MGM Grand. It was really close to lots of other hotels I wanted to walk to and even though there was usually a line for cabs, the wait went by very quickly (they were also legit and trustworthy cabs). I would definitely stay there again if I was going back to Vegas!!

I used to be too scared to climb this mountain. Lately, I've toughened up and now I love it! It's difficult and I'd recommend shoes with good tread and lots of water and a few snacks- fruit or granola bars, because it can be intense. Some people make it up and down with no problem, but people do get hurt here so be careful. Bring your cell phone in case of emergency. There are two sides to this mountain. The more difficult trail is called Echo Canyon. I have also hiked on the Cholla Trail and it's somewhat different. I would say it's less difficult, but still no walk in the park. The higher you get on the trail, the more steep spots you might encounter. Make sure you have good tred on your shoes to avoid falling. Definitely make sure you bring enough water to get yourself through the hike and maybe some extra in case you see a hiker in distress. It's also easy for your pet to get dehydrated so if you bring your dog, give them lots of water breaks and stop in shady spots to recoup your energy. Have fun, but be smart about it! Nature is wild!

I went here on a busy Saturday and had a blast. The crowded restaurant kept flowing and the food was super tasty! It didn't take too long even with having such a busy environment, I was able to distract myself with my drink, my friends and watching the scenery!  I got the FEZ burger and shared it with a friend. YUM!! Omg I couldn't stop eating everything between the amazing burger and the sweet potato fries, my tastebuds were in heaven. Oh wait, I'm not dreaming, I'm just at FEZ.

The food tastes amazing. I don't want to know how much butter they used to make my waffle, but I sure made it disappear. The staff is intelligent, friendly and efficient. There is sometimes a wait to eat here, but they have a waiting list and try to get new customers in quickly. I have eaten here twice this school semester (it's very close to the ASU downtown Phoenix campus) and I keep talking new classmates into going back with me. The ingredients are fresh and very high quality. No wonder they were featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive- ins and Dives. Yum! Try the omelet, it's my favorite.

Restaurant and bar by day, nightclub by night. This is a popular bar on Mill Avenue near ASU campus. They usually have drink specials, but not all day. The staff is good at handling large crowds. I really like the music/ DJ they have here, but the dance floor is tiny.

They had a great selection of food, but not all tasted as good as it looked. I ate a bunch of fruit, some potatoes and some bacon. The other dishes I tried were not great and I didn't finish them. I think for the most part I was upset because of the price. It was $25 per adult and I wasn't able to even come close to eat that much worth in food. I felt like the service staff were nice, but kind of slow. It took a while to get drinks. I wish there were cheaper buffets in Vegas!

I've been to this location a few times over the years and a week ago I attended The Offspring show (Summer Nationals Tour) and everything about the venue and experience was amazing!! My friend and I had the best time for so many reasons.  The venue is an open air amphitheater and has plenty of space for tons of people. This show was PACKED and it still felt like everyone had enough space to move around, dance and enjoy the show. Including me, I DANCED the whole concert. I don't think I came close enough to anyone to bump into them or "throw boes". HAHA This evening was a nice 98 degrees and felt perfect with a slight breeze. I've been here on nights that were a wee bit hotter in the triple digits and it was not quite as enjoyable.   When we arrived to the smallish parking lot and saw that it was full, we decided that was a sign that it would be better to just find parking on the street anyways. I dislike being stuck in a parking lot after a concert or ball game. It's not fun when you're sweaty, hungry and exhausted! So we drove around for about 5 minutes until we found a free spot. It was a little walk away, but we're active people and the short walk went quickly each way because we were super excited about the concert. Don't fear a little walk sometimes, peeps!   There were lines to get into security and to buy beers, but honestly nothing took too long. The bathroom didn't even have long lines. And to avoid buying a $4 water, I bought a draft beer, drank it and the filled my cup repeatedly with water all night. My friend drank more beer, so I keep myself hydrated and drove us home after the show.   Something I found different, to get a 21+ wristband, we had to find a security guard in a red polo shirt, show him the ID's and he gave us wristbands. Usually there is a booth with a long line, so this was different. It seemed to work out just fine for us.   When the concert was over, people start to stream out of there like aggressive little ants. So if you aren't big on being stuck in a line, just wait it out for about 10-15 minutes. Take some selfies or finish a beer or drink some water and then the line will have thinned out a bit.   I'll be looking for more bands to see at Mesa Amphitheatre, especially in the fall with the awesome Arizona weather!

My friend had a craving for vegetarian lettuce wraps and then a PF Changs commercial came on TV. It was an omen, let's go to PF Changs! I ordered a crispy green been appetizer. It was the perfect amount of food. Our server, Ross was polite and knowledgable. I think he has worked here for awhile and he was very good! It had been awhile since I had eaten there, but I'll be back for sure!

I want to go back and eat there right now! It was the best meal I ate in Vegas! I ordered nachos with chicken and a chicken quesadilla (Not looking for the healthiest meal). Staff was nice, didn't stand out as amazing, but overall good service. If you are staying at the MGM Grand, it's really close by. After I ad eaten at McDonald's twice, the buffet and ordered a pizza, I just wanted some yummy Mexican food. Thanks for saving my life that day.

Went there to celebrate a friends' birthday. I really liked hanging out on the patio. It has a ton of tables and a fireplace and heaters. The outside bar is kind of limited in selection, but the DJ was good. The inside bar was busy, but could still order drinks in a reasonable amount of time. I tried the pork nachos. They were decent, not wonderful. Good selection of beer and wine. Overall this place is pretty nice, dress appropriately.

I love this place. They have a large assortment of pasties to choose from. A pasty is similar to a calzone, but these are of English influence. My favorite is the Gobbler- it's a Thanksgiving type dinner wrapped up in a pasty with gravy and cranberry sauce on the side. Mmmmm! Some other recommendations are the Shepard's Pie or Chicken Pot Pie. They even have vegetarian pasties. One important fact- you can't modify the ingredients. They come as they are and they are delicious!!

My office just moved to Ahwatukee and so my boss treated us to lunch as we got more familiar with the new neighborhood. Our staff enjoyed a variety of salads and sandwiches, but the menu has pretty much anything you'd want at lunch or dinnertime. And beer, but that wasn't on our agenda this time!   I ordered the teriyaki chicken sandwich and tots. YUM! It was soooo good. I didn't have much to say at the working lunch, because I was too concerned with stuffing my face! I really liked my meal. The sandwich was even complete with two pineapple rings and teriyaki sauce for a sweet combination! Our service was attentive and the bathrooms were clean. I think our staff will be making CK's a regular thing!

This place is a fun Irish bar with a pretty cool name. It was pretty packed when I was there for happy hour. The appetizers I tried were pretty good, but nothing tasted out of this world. I really like the Pear Cider though. They really have a great selection of unique and Irish brews and the atmosphere really feels like an Irish Pub. It seems a bit out of place in Scottsdale, but I enjoyed being at a bar with a different theme other than the party scene of Old Town Scottsdale.

This place is soooo delicious! I hadn't had sushi in a long time and a co-worker recommended Sushi Ken so I took their advice.   First of all, they have a TON of rolls. Just about any roll you can think of is on their menu. They also have great lunch specials for non-sushi meals like chicken teriyaki etc.. I tried the Sweet Potato Roll and Deluxe Dragon Roll, both were awesome! Those are my two favorite rolls at other sushi spots, so I decided to order my usual. At Sushi Ken, the rolls were prepared a bit differently than expected, but different wasn't a bad thing. I think all sushi places have a slightly different recipe for making a roll. I was impressed with Sushi Ken's quality of ingredients. The service was also pretty good. It was lunch time and we didn't wait too long for our food to arrive. Our table of 3 was very happy with everything we ordered and we can't wait to return! Maybe next time, we'll go for happy hour!

The staff took great care of us from the time we took off to landing. It was nice because one person in our group was a little nervous before the flight and the crew was very helpful in taking their mind off of being nervous.   Our group was lucky that we were able to fly that morning. The captain said the weather conditions weren't exactly ideal, but if we didn't mind a shorter ride we could still go. Thank you so much for that! It was a calm and beautiful experience. I felt the captain was in control of the balloon the whole time and there was nothing to be scared of. The views are amazing in Arizona and a hot air balloon ride is a cool way to experience the Sonoran Desert. From where we started, we flew over mountains and could see Lake Pleasant! We saw lots of Saguaro catci and could almost peer into some basins where desert wildlife roam.   I don't know why waited so long to try a hot air balloon ride, but one thing's for sure, I definitely would go up with Hot Air Expeditions again!

I love flying Southwest Airlines. When I trying to book a flight on-line, the rates were changing and I had trouble with getting the lower price. So I called them. The person I spoke with got me the lower price and I was able to save a lot of money on a nonstop, round trip flight from Phoenix to Baltimore! Thanks so much!

Fresh, delicious meals straight from the farm! They have sandwiches, salads, shakes and ribs! I tried the BBQ Pork Sandwich and a oversized portion of onion rings. I was super full but couldn't say no to the best onion rings on the planet!   My boyfriend order a full rack of ribs and finished the meal by licking his fingers clean. I liked the outdoor seating and view of the family farm. I know this restaurant has been approved by Guy Fieri of Diners Drive-ins and Dives, but just so you know it's Lauren Lizzle approved, as well.

I was not impressed with the Daily Planet. It was about 12:30 a.m. and I was in need of a bite to eat before heading back to the hotel. I ended up here and found it to be pretty disappointing.   We had three or more servers and I appreciate teamwork, but none of them communicated to each other to get our orders right. It was kind of bothersome, but we just wanted food.   Prices on the menu were high and I and decided on a chicken sandwich. The food took a little while and when it arrived nothing about it looked appetizing.   We ate as much of the meals as possible, but is was not worth the money, time or calories!   Next time I'll find a pizza place!

For Christmas, my boyfriend and I received movie tickets and a gift card to CPK for a fun movie date night. We decided to make the plan happen one night and were excited to get out, as we hadn't been to the movies in a long time.   We decided to sit at the bar at CPK because we were watching the World Cup. The bar area is probably not the most popular spot in the whole restaurant, because it only sits like 10 patrons, but we took a chance. Our bartender was a little strange. He mentioned that he doesn't drink repeatedly and it made ordering drinks a little awkward. At one point, we ordered a lemon drop shot and we asked if he could make them. He said they had a martini and he could just pour it into two glasses. Sure. Ok. Fine. I guess that works. It turns out he made each one of us a martini in a rocks glass and charged us for two martinis. This is not what we asked for. And next time, we'll just ask for a table so the bartender who doesn't drink won't make us feel weird about ordering drinks.  I believe our meal was good, I just can't get over the lemon drop shot/martini confusion. I don't mind if someone who works as a bartender doesn't drink, but they should know how to make drinks, which is their job. Part of what you're paying for when you go out is the experience and it kind of ruins it when the situation gets weird.

I don't know where to begin! They have everything for your outdoors needs- camping, hunting, fishing, boats, gear and souvenirs. The other day, I also ate lunch in the restaurant. WHOA! It's half aquarium, half tables and chairs like a real restaurant. It's a pretty cool place and the food wasn't bad either! I had fish tacos and ate them right up! I could probably spend all day in this store!

The food is delicious. This spot is always busy, from early morning until later afternoon. They even have a Chompie's Challenge to eat a bunch of mini sandwiches. It has a New York, Jewish deli type feel. I'd recommend it!

This building is beautiful inside and out. I came here for Innovation Arizona Summit last week and it was my first time there. Well, inside. I've walked and ran by millions of times. But actually walking inside was a real treat. The summit was a very successful event and I enjoyed exploring the TCA for the first time. It's a very artsy and visually appealing place. I loved seeing the Pedestrian Bridge at sunset from inside. Very cool.

Target, whether your pronounce it correctly or not, is great! When I need to buy a few things, I love going to Target. This location is always neat and clean. I like that the grocery department has expanded. It's not quite like a SuperTarget with almost a full grocery store inside, but it covers the bases. Whenever I need to pick up a prescription, I can't help but scan the visually pleasing make-up aisles for a new product. One tip- avoid this particular store during back-to-school. Being so close to ASU, it's a mad house. But after the students are settled, it's safe to return. Which I will!

I love Tempe Marketplace! Convenience, variety, restaurants, shops and a movie theater- what else could you need! My favorite stores are BevMo, Target, PetSmart, Tilly's, Victoria's Secret, Buckle, American Eagle, Chipotle, ... ok so I have a lot of favorites! I even "won" two tickets to the Cirque du Soleil show, Kooza, from Tempe Marketplace. I use the term "won" loosely because you had to spend $150 in one day and bring the receipts to the office to claim the tickets. Well of course I can spend that much.. probably in an hour! HA   There is a huge parking lot, but you still may have to walk a little ways to the stores on busy days like weekends or during Christmastime. If you hate dealing with parking lots, there are buses that run to Tempe Marketplace and it's close enough to ride a bike from some local neighborhoods. Because the layout is open with separate individual stores, it does get pretty hot when walking from store to store in the summer. They have mister machines or you could stop into San Felipe's for a margarita to cool off!

This stadium is pretty huge. Even in the sections higher up you can still see what's happening on the field. From where I was sitting I could hear the band, see the field and where the fireworks were being lit off. Not bad at all. It gets pretty crowded so to get through the crowds hold your friend's hand and weave in and out. You will save a bunch of time when getting out of the stadium. They don't serve beer, but you can bring in a bottle of water if you haven't opened it. Don't lose your ticket because it might be hard to remember where you were sitting. Or maybe that's just me. Oh one more thing, if you go to a day game, wear sunscreen and bring sunglasses! You'll thank me!

I love the decor of skulls and surfboards. Been a fan of this place since it was called Chronic Taco and that's why I'd go there. But I liked the quesadillas and a Dos XX. Still a good place to go when out on Mill Avenue. One complaint: They have Rockstar over Redbull. Great view of "A" Mountain from the patio.

Has a fun bar atmosphere. I like the patio or the bar, I'm not really expecting a restaurant experience when I go to San Felipe's. Some servers are better than others. I remember the host being really nice. Short shorts, cowboy boots, beer and nachos- that's why this place rocks.

I love Mexican food, even the "fake" kind that other people complain about. Well, I'm not complaining! Tacos, burritos, quesadillas,  taco bowls, chips and salsa- I love them all! I like how the price doesn't change if you choose steak instead of chicken. Some of the other toppings cost extra, but only get what you want and can afford. I like to add veggies to my tacos for an extra charge, but I know it's worth it for some vegetables in my meal. So I will be returning.. many, many times!

I went to this location by accident. I thought I was on my way to the "Yelp Goes Under The Tuscan Sun" event, but I went to the wrong location. The reason why I didn't turn around and hed straight to the yelp event was because we arrived at 6:40 p.m. at the Santan Mall location and we were supposed to go to the Scottsdale Quarter location. Because it was rush hour and we had already driven from Tempe, at this point we just wanted to have a nice meal.   At first I was bummed when I didn't see red yelp balloons and a line of eager yelpers ready to mingle, but I was starving so I decided to stay for dinner. The manager and server were very accommodating to me and my friend and I really appreciate the effort they made to make us feel welcome- despite no yelp event to attend. I really wasn't that upset!   The food was delicious. I'm pretty sure the words "tantalizing taste buds" came to mind that night. I loved the ravioli appetizer and white peach sangria! My server was so sincere and attentive. I want to say his name was Fausto. My apologies if I'm wrong. The manager was very sweet, as well. Thanks so much for letting my friend and I create our own idea of what a yelp event could be with a guest list limited to 2. HAHA

Got a bright idea? Are you a small business or an entrepreneur? This place has it all! I went on a tour here and felt like a sponge taking in waves of innovative vibes. There are all kinds of programs for small businesses to apply for and great opportunities and connections that go along with the programs. So what are you waiting for? Get your pitch together and apply!   I also love the architecture with the giant white structures! So photogenic. I'll upload some pics.

Quick, affordable and yummy. Thirsty Dog rocks! It's perfect for days when you need lunch and don't have much time.   I have been here many times for the convenience store aspect to buy a pack of gum or a Redbull, but the other day I had a hot dog. Ahhhh!  First of all, there are many choices so I need to stop in more often! I loaded my dog with ketchup, tomato and a pickle. I could tell this was a quality hot dog. Some other brands taste cheap and make you wonder just what you are eating, but there's no reason to be suspicious of these dogs!   So, how do you top your dog?   P.S. They have funny bumper stickers for free!

I have been here twice for pedicures. I felt relaxed and confident that my pedicure would turn out nicely. The staff is friendly and will make conversation with you or leave you alone depending on your mood. I felt that they are experienced and know what they are doing. They do try to up-sell you and that can be slightly annoying, but that's part of their job. The atmosphere is calm and serene like it should be at a spa. I would recommend this place to friends.

Do you want me to have nightmares forever? Because after running screaming through a field of masked characters with chainsaws, I think I'm scarred for life! This haunted house is huge with a creepy corn maze, old abandoned town with haunted cathedral, a crashed alien spaceship and clowns in a mad house! NO, THANK YOU! I'm terrified of clowns! So next time I need to bring more friends to protect me or go through the kiddie corn maze! No doubt, Fear Farm is the scariest place in Arizona!

I met a friend for brunch here the other day. We had a nice meal with good service. My friend is a server/ bartender and I was for years, so we like to get to know our server chatting with them a little. We know to respect our servers, but if we want or need something how to ask for things nicely because we understand what it's like to be in their shoes. I ordered a veggie omelet with some modifications and it came out perfectly. I like when you can see that all employees in the restaurant are hustling and working together. I guess the reason why I only gave 4 stars is because I really love breakfast places and U.S. Egg has some stiff competition with other breakfast spots in Tempe!

My favorite feature of Tempe. I always take my dog running or ride my bike at the lake. I also have gone fishing and kayaking here. They just restocked the lake with trout for the fall, so it's the perfect time to get out my fishing pole! This park houses lots of events, festivals, races, etc. It's the heart of the town with two lighted bridges that have beautiful reflections at night. Good for the end to a first date! Hint hint!

Just about my favorite place in Arizona. I love to run, bike or walk around at this park. They also have boat rentals which I recommend! Great for a picnic or having ice cream with friends. The view at sunset is breathtaking! They have events like beer fests, marathons and concerts throughout the year. And the best fireworks in the area for the Fourth of July. If you love the outdoors and haven't been here, you are missing out!

I walked up to the store on a Sunday afternoon and it looked packed. I was hesitant and wondered if it would be difficult to get assistance from a salesperson. That's how my experiences had gone with other larger chain outdoor outfitters, but I was happily surprised as I watched the staff seamlessly help multiple customers at a time. They were great at juggling the needs of each customer. I needed to buy new shoes for two upcoming races that I've been training for, but I was actually looking for something else, too. Confidence. I was a bit shaken after a minor injury (swollen toenail) caused by wearing the wrong type of shoe. After working with your Tempe sales guy Ryan for about 45 minutes, trying on 5 different pairs of shoes and giving them a whirl on the treadmill and on the pavement, I found a winner!!! They were even on sale! I was so happy to give them my money. HAHA I don't think I've ever said that before, but yes I found the right pair of shoes for my running habits and the confidence I needed to get back out there and run past my swollen toenail. Who needs toenails anyways? Thank you so much, Ryan!!

Fun, energetic atmosphere. Bartenders were fast. The bar had no cover on a Friday night so I'm happy about that.  The place was pretty crowded, but not so bad that you couldn't walk around. I had a good time!

One of the first froyo places on Mill Ave. I like this place a lot. They have a good selection of yogurt flavors and toppings such as fresh fruit, candy and assorted nuts.  It's better with a coupon because I like a lot of toppings and it can get expensive. Sometimes I find buy one get one free coupons, which make me :)

Good tasty meals already prepared! That's perfect for a non-chef like me. I think their selection of other goods are more limited and pricey. But if you don't mind buying Fresh and easy brand, it's definitely a good deal. I picked out a nice bottle of wine for dinner, as well. Wish there was one closer to me!

Excellent service and delicious food. I even showed up pretty late before closing one night and the staff seemed to mind. I'm sorry for that by the way! The manager and our server both took amazing care of my party and dealt with our late night antics. Last night in Vegas and Redbulls.. I'm sure you get it. Thanks for everything! P.F. Changs in Vegas is the best!

I had a lovely evening catching up with friends at Postino last week. It was my first time ever going and I was excited because I had heard so many good things! We went on a Tuesday night right in time for the wine and bruschetta special. We must have good timing. Mmmm! I love bruschetta and wine, it was like I came to my happy place and they knew what I wanted to order! My favorite was the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. It's the perfect mix of sweet and savory. I could eat that everyday - no problem!  The restaurant was crazy busy, but they offered valet parking, which was a nice touch. There isn't much available parking so I rather leave it to the professionals and take the stress out of my night! I think the wait staff was a little overwhelmed because it took awhile for our food and drinks and our server seemed in the weeds, but I can be patient when enjoying time with good friends! I'll definitely be back!

Located in the Clarendon Hotel, Gallo Blanco is a urban, upscale, fresh eatery that I am pleased to have the opportunity to try. The menu consists of fresh local ingredients, in simple, but unique dishes that have their own personality. I was impressed with the service, as my water was never empty or any need ignored. I ordered a breakfast sampler and for my wheat toast I asked for some jam. The server brought out a yummy orange marmalade that was no doubt homemade. I could compare this style of food to Matt's Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix, which also has a really great reputation. Must try Gallo Blanco!

I came here for a Yelp event and had a great time. They have the place somewhat divided into two sections- bar and restaurant. I liked that the patio opens right into the bar so you kind of have an extended bar. The food was really good and the staff rocked. I have been meaning to go back. I'll put that on my to-do list!

I stopped in on Black Friday for a quick look. I spotted my favorite running socks on sale and grabbed four pairs and headed to the line. I don't know what happened but it was all backed up at the registers for about 15 minutes. By the time I checked out, the sale had ended on the socks. It was 3:20 p.m. and the sale ended at 3. Fortunately I was quiet and patient and the manager on duty, Laurie, honored the sale price anyways. I wanted to say I really appreciate that and know they value their customers by that action. I left a happy customer on Black Friday!

Not even nice for a sports bar. The bathrooms could use a lot of work. The stainless steel stalls of the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. Seat cleaners were empty and one door was had duct tape holding it together as a repair job. Seems like any chain restaurant should have better standards than this.  The bar was not busy but we waited forever for drinks, appetizers and refills. I was not impressed and my boss who suggested McFadden's after our event at UOP stadium, was very displeased.  We had a group of no more than 8 people, who arrived one by one. The server was unable to get drinks and orders taken in a timely manner for new guests. We ordered hummus for the table and when the pita and cucumbers were all gone, by boss asked for more pita to finish our hummus. There must have been some sort of mixup with another order that was placed because the pita still didn't show up after 20 minutes had passed. The manager had an excuse about the server ringing in an order as an appetizer vs. entree. I'm aware this mistake happens in serving. I was a server for years, but in this situation I feel that if you ask the kitchen for some pita, it shouldn't take that long even if the server made a mistake with the order. It only takes a minute to heat up and put on a plate. We could have been satisfied with a simple we are sorry and we are working on fixing it right now.   It seemed like even the manager would rather make an excuse than just get the job done. A manager should set the example and level of customer service for the whole restaurant. It was a sad display.   I don't see myself returning to McFadden's for any reason in the future.

I met my boss and another business partner here for lunch. It was the business partner's choice, as he called it his "local watering hole" for the service, food and beer selection. Thanks King James Swann! I loved The Hungry Monk, Heather was great and the manager even stopped by to say hello.   This place was pretty busy for lunch and had lots of big TVs so I could see sports scores in between business conversations. I love when a restaurant can draw a good lunch crowd because it lends you to want to come back be a part of the happy hour and night crowd, as well.   They have a lunch menu on the back, so be sure to check it out! I also saw they have board games for customers to play. That's a cool idea!

This location is awesome! It's very clean and fully stocked with great fashions! They have a ton of great name brands in purses, shoes, clothing for everyone in your family and even house ware items. I love being able to find dressy clothes for work, casual clothes for weekends and evenings and workout clothes for the gym!

I'm here at least twice a month. I'm happy with the facilities and staff. They have about 8 TVs and offer free wifi. Once I thought I lost something and they let me look in lost and found, didn't find it but they  at least let me look.

The Worst Walmart in town. Employees have even less ethic than I've ever seen. Someone left their dog in the car in a hot morning and I listened to two customer service employees debate about whether to make a store wide page notifying guests to get the dog out. One lady named Janel even made the comment I don't even like pets.  THAT IS NOT YOUR CALL TO MAKE!     Oh yeah the other employees name was Claudia. Team awesome right there!   No someone should not have left their dog in the car on a hot day, but once an employee was notified they should've acted immediately. No debate! They even compared to if a child was left in the car and didn't seem to think it was as important. I'm glad the cops just showed up so something will get taken care of, but no help to your to customer service representatives. I am extremely disgusted that people like this exist. But of course they would work at Walmart.   P.S. This store is store is also super small and only has a fraction of the items of a normal Walmart. Save yourself the frustration and go to Target on Baseline and McClintock.

I love this place. It's the closest bar within walking distance to me and I take advantage of that! They have good deals on Thursday nights and it gets packed on the patio. I usually see people I know from school or around town from time to time here. The staff is pretty good. I usually have good service. I like the Aloha Chicken sandwich or the Hawaiian pizza with a tall Blue Moon. They also have big flat screen tv's for football games!

I'm a beach babe at heart and this is the closest I can get in Arizona without planning a longer journey. The lake is very calm. I like to hang out at Butcher Jones Recreation Area because it has a large beach and the water is shallow, good for hanging out with friends or family. We brought our dog last time, which I guess you're not supposed to do, but I kept him on the leash and there were no problems.   FYI- No campfires in the summertime! Bring a grill or sandwiches. :0) Also if you plan on drinking, make sure one person stays sober. There will be cops looking for you on the way out. Going to the lake and getting a DUI would definitely ruin a day at the lake.

First time trying Thai food and I thought it was awesome! A friend recommended the place. I went in the late afternoon and it wasn't very busy, but more people came in while I was there. I liked it being quiet- we had good service and the food was ready pretty quickly. Can't wait to go back!

I sure wish my living room looked like this place! Great interior design with a classy, sophisticated atmosphere. I recently planned my boss's 50th birthday here and we had a great evening! Thanks for great service, we had one dedicated server and he was on it! We also planned to have appetizers and pizzas delivered throughout the evening and it worked out perfectly! We had some flatbread pizzas, bruschetta planks, spinach artichoke dip, sliders and cheese fondue. Plenty for all of our guests and everything kept disappearing so we clearly enjoyed it!   The restaurant was packed on this particular evening and the staff handled it like champs. I would hold other parties or events here, making sure to plan the menu and discuss our wants with a manager ahead of time.   I totally forgot to mention the layout of this restaurant. It's pretty cool. There are a few really neat wrap around patios. And inside the dining room has an open layout with smaller little nooks for larger groups. Check it out, you'll definitely be comfortable in this living room!

I really feel this place is hit or miss in customer service. I've been in to this store many times and I either feel bombarded by a salesperson or the opposite, completely ignored. I think it should be more consistent for a store with a higher quality of clothing. I would compare Buckle to the Guess store down the hall and Guess has great sales tactics.   So back to Buckle, the displays are very attractive and they make you want to construct a full outfit in the store. Good plan guys! It's totally worked on me. I just feel that sometimes it's difficult to find your size, like if stock is low, they didn't much try to help me find the correct size. We're out of it. Thanks for really looking in to that for me! Maybe call another store, try to get my business? I hate to feel like I'm bothering someone to do their job for a $100+ clothing purchase.

I have always had good customer service here. They always ask to re-size or find other styles for me when I'm in the fitting room. I have never had an issue with returns. It's difficult to not find a new treasure when going in to just pay the credit card bill though- good tactic! This is the only place I go to for Pink ASU apparel because it's not available online. But It's all good in the hood.

This museum is like no other. It's full of musical Instruments from all over the world. There is a room for each continent containing traditional instruments used by people in different countries. There's even an experience room where you get to play with the instruments hands-on without being yelled that! I didn't have enough time to see everything because I was only there for an hour. But I will be back! I know the Taylor Swift exhibit just opened and I want to explore more of the other rooms with different countries. It was the most fun I've ever had learning about music- that's for sure!

The light rail is great. I ride it 3 or 4 times a week. It's cheap transportation with air conditioning and free entertainment. Most people will leave you alone, but public transportation is open to everyone so you will sometimes run into interesting characters. I usually listen to music, play with FB on my phone or read for class.   It's definitely a more crowded commute when there's a Diamondbacks or Suns game, between the 9-5 travel "rush hours" and during the school year. In the summer, it's pretty empty. I took my bike on the train without a problem all summer long, but I find it's sometimes too crowded to bring my bike with me during the school year (ASU mostly, but there are other high school kids on it sometimes, too.) It only stops in certain cities from the Mesa/Tempe border to North Phoenix, at this point, but there are plans for expansion. If you happen to be attending an event at US Airways Center, you can ride the light rail for free with your ticket stub. Watch out though, meter maids hop on and off the trains checking for train tickets. I see them once or twice a week.You sometimes see homeless people duck off the train when they get on. Oh wells. It happens. And my favorite part is that Valley Metro likes to use social media! Use the twitter handle @METROrail. They usually respond back!

Restaurant by day, popular bar by night. Ever since this place opened, it's been a happenin' spot. They have a large patio with its own bar and usually a DJ. Inside, there is a small stage and usually have an Irish band playing. I've eaten there also- pretty good food. Mostly, I just go for a few drinks and to hang out with friends.

I can only give this hotel 4 stars because I didn't stay here and didn't get the full Cosmopolitan experience. I can imagine that it's worth all 5 stars, but I can't know for sure just yet. I did however visit the casino a few times during the day and night. It's gorgeous inside with strands of crystals hanging from the ceiling like you are actually inside a chandelier. OMG I loved it, sooo pretty. The clubs and shops inside were top notch and most probably out of my price range, but awesome none the less. I went to the Sports Book and got to watch my team kick butt for a little while on their screen of TV's. I had bet at my casino, but The Cosmopolitan's odds were better. This place is pretty much one of the nicest hotels on the Strip right now. I walked through almost every single hotel, and this one really stood out!

A cheap and effective car wash. I like that they provide a vacuum for customers to use for free. It's nice to have a clean interior and exterior. Every time I have been here, I'm in and out in about 10 minutes. Good to have speedy service for something like a car wash where you might not have a lot of time.

This hike is gorgeous! It's pretty steep. I wouldn't suggest this hike to a beginner. There are some spots of loose gravel so be careful! If you hike from the parking lot to the peak, it's about 2.6 miles each way.  The trail is in North Scottsdale and from the peak you can see Camelback, South Mountain, A Mountain, The Four Peaks and other various ranges in all directions. It's truly a breathtaking view. You may even see some wildlife and the Fountain Hills fountain.   Make sure you bring: Lots of water A snack A cell phone and/ or camera  Wear appropriate shoes because it will really effect how you feel on your hike and your chances of preventing injuries. Try athletic shoes with good tread or hiking boots for the best results.   Have fun!

Good price range. Lots of cute accessories. I probably spend way too much time in here. I think the best idea would be to shop for a specific outfit like one you just bought because it narrows down the options. I found one sales person helpful, he showed me a few different things. I don't remember anyone else that worked there.

This store has cute clothes from the window, but I really haven't found any show stopping items here. It's mostly trendy styles in basic colors. I have bought a couple of dresses here over the years, but much of what I've tried on was way too short or not flattering on my body type. The last few times I shopped here, I felt like the sales people were overly pushy and trying to style me up in something I wasn't interested in. Also if there are more than 5 customers in the store, it seems like a walk-in closet and too crowded for comfort. Not a huge fan, although I give it a try whenever I need a new dress for an occasion. Still hoping..

I finally tried Smashburger the other night. I got the original smash, but I am not a huge fan of the sauce. I'm a ketchup kind-of-girl, so good thing I got the sauce on the side. I will probably try a chicken sandwich next time, but I thought I'd go traditional for my first time. I caved in and also got the mint shake and um yes it was SO worth it! Delish!

My first visit upon the grand opening was not good. I thought the bar was huge and empty. I ordered a beer and it was warm. So I hadn't been back in a long time.   I decided to give it another try when some friends had suggested going to Canteen. It was fun and full of people. My beverages tasted much better this time. I liked the tacos and short rib appetizer. The BBQ sauce is zesty and sweet and the meat falls right off the bone! YUM!!!  I don't like that the bathrooms are very small and lines extend out through the hand washing area, which is open to part of the restaurant area. That was my main complaint. It's kind of awkward to be in line to use the bathroom as people are checking their make up and washing hands..

This is probably my 5th time here. Ive had a good experience each time. But obviously some servers are going to better than others. Most are decent. I love the BBQ rib appetizer- its very tender, delicious and falls right off the bone!! Do NOT eat directly over your pants or you might have a BBQ stain on your jeans. Ha ha they have tacos, margaritas and pineapple infused tequila shots! Definitely a good place for some fun!

Came here for happy hour with my co-workers. The restaurant wasn't very busy and we had large group, but a server was nearby whenever we needed them. I loved all of the sushi that I tried, but I don't know the names of the dishes because they were ordered by other people. I ordered the coconut shrimp and it was really good. I didn't like the calamari, though, because it had a weird fishy taste. I can't wait to come back here for sushi. It was the best I've had in awhile!

I tend to enjoy a good scavenger hunt and shopping at thrift stores excites me in ways that shouldn't be normal! It's a cool feeling to find a super unique shirt or dress AND it's in your size and looks great when its tried on?! Score! I've had really great experiences at Plato's Closet. The staff was friendly and helpful. I have found really good items in good or excellent condition for awesome prices. I have not sold anything yet, but I'm thinking instead of reselling to their competitors in Tempe, I may give Plato's Closet first dibs on my used clothes. If you are on a budget, definitely check this place out. You will find current styles and good name brands and not even gasp when the cashier reads your total!

Freaky fast like promised. First time eating at Jimmy John's- no lie. I was not really interested in another Subway type place. The sandwich was pretty yummy and I didn't take an hour to decide. I arrived right before the lunch rush so I felt lucky because people just came crawling out of no where to line up for Jimmy Johns. They also had like 6 delivery bike riders. Sounds like they are ready to feed an Army. Ok I tried it. Yum. I'll be back, but next time less mayo!

Great food- specialty pizzas & 48 draft beers! Did I mention their happy hour deals??  Half off drinks and munchies from 3-6 and reverse happy hour drinks from 10-2 Mon-Fri! The staff is friendly and the restaurant has a laid back feel. Ask for Kevin if you want great service. Each pizza is made to order on a stone and hand tossed, so prepare for a wait depending on how busy the place is- or start with a salad. I love the Dude's Chicken Salad and the Mellow Chopped salad with pepperoni!

This location is not very close by, as I live in Tempe, but when it's a Monday and you're craving Spinato's one will make the longer drive! For some reason, I feel that once the pizza was a little underdone coming from the Chandler store, but none-the-less it's still delicious. So why are the other's closed on Monday's?   After camping for four days with only freeze-dried food to eat, my boyfriend and I were CRAVING some Italian goodness from Spinato's. We dreamed about it for days. Well it happened to be a Monday, and we still got what our little hearts desired, but our exhausted camper selves had to drive for it!   I can barely even eat Papa Johns style of "fast food" pizza anymore. I'm becoming a Spinato's snob. Sorry. Not that sorry!   My faves: Pizza- 1/2 Hawaiian and 1/2 Super Six, hot wings with ranch and a Greek Salad without olives

Come here to cowork and to be part of the startup community in Phoenix. The owners are great - Jenny and Odeen have been a huge influence on entrepreneurial change happening around Downtown Phoenix. They are such enthusiastic business owners that spread a feeling of community every where they go.   I'm so glad I found this place to work when I was lonely and "working from home." CO+HOOTS gave me a place to feel productive among others just like me. They also held many incredible seminars in various fields to provide some educational aspect to being involved at CO+HOOTS. Also, the Food Truck's (Washington Wednesdays) is an awesome touch. They bring in a new food truck each week for their hungry inhabitants to indulge. Keep up the good work in Phoenix and keep coworking!

This Haunted House was so scary! The zombies and actors throughout the house were very realistic looking with crazy costumes and make up. They seemed to pop out of just about every corner. I liked how some rooms were tilted and were hard to walk on. Some rooms even had different aromas to make you feel like you were in an insane asylum or zombieland. It was pretty unique. Whenever I went into a new room, someone popped up screaming at me which made me scream even louder! The whole thing lasted about 30 minutes, which I think is pretty long. The rooms were so realistic looking that I was worried I was going to have nightmares! I'm so ready for Halloween, now!

I love that bike rentals are back. There are kayaks, paddle boats, pontoon boats, and a few other things to rent. I have been out kayaking twice and used the paddle boat once. It's really fun. Kayaking is difficult on a windy day though. Luckily, I'm up for a challenge! They also sell water, Gatorade and snacks at the rental booth.

I've been a fan of Goodwill since childhood. It's where all my "oldies, but goodies" went after I out grew them. It's where I bought that crazy costume, cool cowboy boots and old prom dress. Haha come to think of it, it's where the "ugly sweater" Christmas gifts and the old sofa, rug and lamps went, too. Go there and buy my old stuff!  But anyways I know they use donations to put people to work and that's a good thing! I have made about $1,000 worth of donations during my recent move and hope that goes to good use?! :)

I was there for a friends' birthday party recently and it was pretty dead on a weekend night while other bars just down the street were filled to the max and seemed like a really good time. At one point I went into the bathroom and it smelled so incredibly bad. I feel that a unisex bathroom should have candles or air fresheners to keep it smelling fresh. But honestly, unisex bathrooms are getting old to me. They don't seem to promote cleanliness because they are never clean. It seems like the bathroom situation at a night club would be more effective if the hall wasn't clogged with drunk men and women at the same time.  This place gives off a cold vibe from the moment you walk in the door. The bartenders are rather stuck up and don't seem overly attentive. I had been here in 2011 when The Mint was newer and had a better experience, but I feel like it's going downhill. I hope no one else plans their birthday party for this location anytime soon.

I love breakfast and refused to go to the local Denny's for a brunch date. I looked up alternatives and found Mark's Cafe. I decided to spurge and got a plate of gargantuan pancakes! Never have I been so happy to see so many carbs. But it was worth it.   This cafe is a smaller and more intimate establishment. The food came out quickly and I felt our waitress was very attentive. At the end, we even thanked Mark, the chef for his delicious meal!

Even though I've been eating burgers like it's my job lately, I stopped in Paradise Valley Burger Co. for lunch after a recommendation from a client. I was in their neck of the woods, so I took their word.   Well, forget the diet! I'd eat a burger every day if I'd known about this place!  A delicious, buttery burger bun, a juicy, seasoned burger with Havarti cheese and lots of ketchup! MMMMMmmmmm. It was so amazing. I also had a side of sweet potato tots, which quickly disappeared into my belly! I've heard ALL of their burgers are amazing, so I'll have to pay them another visit very soon! Also if you are nearby, check out the local scuba shop, Academy of Scuba!

Great breakfast and lunch spot. You would want to go here for dinner, too, but it closes at 3:05 p.m. I've wondered why it's 3:05, but I decided that maybe it's to give you 5 minutes to get in at the last minute. If not, oh well that's just my speculation. I have found it difficult to order because everything on the menu sounds good. I have eaten and loved the Banana's Foster French Toast, the Loaded Omelette and the Turkey Pesto on Focaccia. Yum Yum Yum. Oh I almost forgot I had the Blueberry Blast Smoothie and it was delicious- pretty much everything is good! They are also right next to the light rail. I like that A LOT! But beware, it's always busy, so it might not be a good place if you literally only have minutes. Another plus, is the patio is dog friendly. The patio is my favorite place to sit because of the great people watching opportunities on Mill Ave, but I wish it was a little bigger.

One night I was really craving a cheesesteak so I called and ordered Genos. They said it was going to take an hour and I considered going to pick it up because I live only five minutes from Genos. Well when it is actually delivered to my house, it had taken more like an hour and a half. The food was soggy and fries were cold. I was very disappointed.

This is a brand new cafe. I was excited to see that it's now open. The interior has a cool bistro theme. I sat on the patio with my bike because there is no bike rack. There are a lack of bike racks at the Arizona Center, in general. But back to the cafe, the food was pretty good. I had trouble deciding what to try. I had a pastry and it was ok, but next time I would try an actual breakfast entree. My friend said the lemonade was really good. Prices are medium ranged. Similar to those of Paradise Bakery, one of their competitors I would assume. The staff was very friendly.

Good tacos, like really tasty! I like the large beers. Probably the only restaurant to make it on that corner of Mill Avenue. I like the simplicity of this place. You order at the door and they give you a number and bring out the food when it's ready.

Five stars! That's right, beer fans if you haven't seen what OSHO has to offer, you're missing out!   First off their beer selection rocks. You can even brew your own beer and pick a name for it with their on-staff beer geniuses. The happy hour prices are awesome - you can get a pitcher or a pint and I think during happy hour the pitchers are only a dollar more than a pint. So that's a tough decision ha ha!  Next, this place is dog friendly on the patio. So bring your pup and some friends next time. They have a dog wash station and a little dog bowl bar to keep your canine buddy hydrated. They even bake homemade dog treats from leftover grain from the beer making process.  They also have beer events and smoke meats on the patio for barbecues. If any of this sounds appetizing to you, plan a happy hour with your friends at OSHO! You won't regret it.   P.S. the patio gets pretty full, but I believe they take reservations, so give them a call to find out, if you plan to bring a large party.

I love to make a build-your-own salad in between classes. They aren't usually cheap, but it's plenty of food to keep me going through the rest of the day. I was sad they didn't have their Italian dressing last time, but their house dressing is really good. It's a twist on balsamic vinaigrette, but much better! One suggestion to have coupons in the ASU Coupon Book!!

I had a blast at Lucky Break. The happy hour specials are really good for large sharable appetizers and drinks. It's close to my apartment which is something I value when trying to get a drink close by before going home. The staff was very friendly and kept our drinks full. I like how there's something for everyone. You can watch sports, play pool, play video games, talk with friends, have drinks and all feel like they belong.   Downfalls: The pipes in the restroom smell nasty. Similar taste in the drinking water.

I'm not always a happy camper when I walk into the Verizon store, but I must say the last few times I have walked out a happy customer. Dare I say their customer service may have improved? I don't like pushy sales situations so when salesmen start trying to upsell and drop a bunch of lines, I get turned off. I know their job is sales, but I usually just try to do my own thing looking around until I'm ready for help.   I'm very pleased with the iPhone warranty replacement I just received. It looks like a brand new phone. I felt like that process was really easy and I really didn't have to go out of my way or be inconvenienced. In the past, it took awhile to get the new phone and I don't remember the transition being as simple. (I remember losing contacts, photos and being without a phone for a few days on one occasion.) So this time around, life was gravy baby.   Main gripe= too expensive. But you get what you pay for and I rather pay more to have a reliable phone service and quality equipment.

My boss suggested this place for lunch last week and I'm so happy he did! I had never been before and the BBQ was so good! I had the sliders with mashed potatoes and brought home some ribs for my boyfriend. We are definitely keeping this place on our To-Do List!

What's better than your favorite coffee hot, iced or frozen? Getting your caffeine fix at Dutch Bros! They have an amazing staff of friendly, outgoing people who chat you up for a minute while singing to the music and working alongside their equally fun coworkers!   I love the Cocomo and any flavor mixed with a sugar-free Blue Rebel! I"m not even the biggest coffee drinker, but I've become a loyal part of the Dutch Mafia and proud of it!   Go on Tuesday for double stamps and when you get 10 stamps, the 11th drink is free! They always have free whipped cream and flavors, so get creative with your order! They also hand out dog treats when you walk or drive up with your pup! #DutchLove

I LOVE PIZZA!!! My friend and I ordered a pepperoni pizza for carry out. The pizza was sooo good! I love the crust, it's thick and buttery. I do have other favorite pizza places, but for the price this is awesome food. I'd order again.

Great spot for a hearty breakfast! I'm so glad my boss recommended it on our road trip to Vegas. I was really hoping he didn't want to hit up a crappy McDonalds like most people do on a road trip. I don't mind stopping the extra 30 minutes to get a decent meal.   The staff was attentive and friendly. I'm pretty sure we met the owner/chef. Nice guy!   If you're trying to find this place, look for the cow cutouts on the fence out front! Moo!

Delicious and healthy - I love to eat here for any reason! Recently, my coworkers and I have been to Pita Jungle for a slew of work-related celebrations. Everyone can find something that suits them on the menu and they even have yummy cocktails and a bar at this location. Hummus anyone? Yes, please! I'm a big fan of the tzatziki, the Philly Chicken Pita and Mahi Mahi with Pita Chips.    Tip - if you are dining in for lunch either get there early to avoid the lunch rush or opt for a later lunch. This place gets slammed and sometimes you have to wait for a table. No complaints from me though, I enjoy walking around admiring their local artists work on display.

Look no further Tempe residents! These mechanics are fair, honest and friendly. I am now their customer and will continue to be. It's hard to find a good mechanic that you can trust that charges a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend them. The mechanic, Savo really knows his stuff! Ask for the ASU discount, if you're a student.

We are all super bummed that Emerson Fry Bread did not show up for our scheduled Food Truck Lunch today. We have over 50 hungry employees who were eager to eat at a food truck for lunch, as our campus Cafe is closed this week. It was a nice alternative that our Happiness Committee attempted to offer us and to no fault of their own, the event is ruined and now we need to come up with another plan to feed our hungry employees ASAP. I guess we'll be eating disappointment for lunch.

It's so nice to have a healthy, yet quick alternative to fast food. I love to get a full salad and sandwich to have food for the whole day. I haven't really had anything that I didn't like here. I think that when you start looking at all of the ingredients one might start to think what is that or do I like that? I try to just go with whatever toppings are included (barring any allergies) because I have faith that they know what they are doing! I like to introduce myself to new foods that I'm not familiar with because I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but am trying to be more conscious of eating healthy. I'm so happy to have discovered the wonderful treat to your body that is D'lish!

I enjoyed a nice lunch here with co-workers. The service was good, a little slow, but we weren't in a rush. The salad I ordered was delicious and the server kept our drinks full. Thanks for a nice dining experience.   P.S. I didn't pay for the bill, but I think it's a little pricey.

I first paid a visit to Lustre for a Yelp Cocktail Society competition and had a blast trying to make the most delicious cocktail out of four different teams. It had been awhile since that event and just recently I needed to come up with a cool place for my boyfriend's birthday. We decided Lustre would be great because it's so open and relaxing for larger parties. They also have an amazing selection of drinks with lots of fresh juices. Yum!   I love the location and view of downtown Phoenix from Lustre Rooftop Garden Bar. Lustre Bar is located on the 3rd floor of the swanky Hotel Palomar. We had reserved a hotel for the birthday festivities and it was definitely the best plan ever. We had the option of having cake and champagne in the hotel room and then we headed up to Lustre for a few more rounds.   If you are visiting Phoenix, this hotel is centrally located in downtown Phoenix with access to CityScape dining and entertainment, Golds Gym and the Valley Metro Light Rail, as well as Chase Field and US Airways Center, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Phoenix Suns.    Make sure to plan a pool party at Lustre in the spring! It's definitely on my to-do list.

This place is awesome! The staff is very friendly and I spoke with Kenny and Tony about how they started their business. Very friendly guys! They have a huge indoor shooting range and give classes or just some expert advice while you're shopping. Thanks for your help guys!

Great new spot! It's nice to see some more quality bars open in the Mill Ave District. I wish they had a kitchen, but at least their selection of beers is awesome! Lots of unique beers and seasonals. I like to try a few samples before making a choice and they're ok with that! Last time I tried a Fall Cider by Woodchuck, I believe, and a yummy strawberry beer. Def go check it out. They don't have a huge seating area. There is a bar rail, some booths and "community style" tables that seat maybe 6 people, a vault room and a few tables upstairs. Maybe it's just that the place is somewhat narrow, but whenever I've been there- it's pretty crowded!

Fate Brewing Company brews small batch beers brewed on location. They have a rotating list of 10 Fate beers and space for two guest beers on tap. When I payed a visit, I ordered a beer flight and tasted five of their top beers that day. My favorite was the Coffee Milk Porter with coffee from Cartel Coffee Lab in the recipe! I took a growler home for the boyfriend to try!   Travis gave me a tour of the brewery and introduced me to the brewer Adam! He's in charge of beer flavor creativity and I must say he does a good job! He started out in culinary school and found himself interested in brewing. The brewery also has a kitchen that specializes in wood-fired pizza. Yum!  I can't wait to go back and see what beers they have on tap next!

Cool atmosphere. I like the rotating selection of beers, but lately my favorite brews tend to be more fruity beers. I loved the Peche Mel Brasserie dubuisson freres Belgium. They do flights in small glasses in muffin tins. Cute idea. I also tried a sandwich and french fries. Gotta have the fries! Am I right? Anywhere I go, I have to test them! So they fries passed the Lizzle test, they are garlicky and come with house ketchup- it's zesty and I love it! I also think the patio would be a stellar location for some winter fire pit relaxing. Just sayin!

I can never make up my mind so it's nice that they only have a few god options. Good place to eat when you are really hungry, as these meals will fill you UP! I also heard a rumor that it's not low fat. I'm not sure I believe it, though. I like that they advertise the #hashtag in the drive thru so you can upload your pics to social media!

The waiting room was empty and now I know why. And come to think of it, this urgent care looks empty every time I pass by. One day I was "urgently" sick and walked right in. I now know that this is a very expensive Urgent Care, more so than others I've been to and it's upsetting because it's located less than a mile from ASU. When college kids get sick they probably can't afford to spend $250 for a visit without insurance. Come on! Sniffle sniffle. I'm going back to bed!

I was meeting a friend for lunch on her layover and we chose this spot to catch up in a relaxing setting. It was just that. We talked for awhile and finally ordered.   Thanks for great service and letting us chill there for awhile. To us, the time was going by too fast! We even outlasted our server and had other well mannered servers complete the end of the experience. Thanks Dawn and Dawn.  I had never been to this chain before, but I loved the food and there were other things I wanted to try on the menu. I heard the French dip is awesome. So that'll have me coming back!   I live in town so it was interesting trying to get into the airport, but in the process I got to use the new SkyTrain, which was cool. Lucky for me, I don't have to go to the airport the next time I want to dine at Chelsea's Kitchen. I appreciate the local Phoenix culinary influence in the airport, but it's also nice to know I don't always need to worry about airport antics if I'm not traveling.

I came here with my boss to get a drink and talk about work stuff. The bar wasn't very busy so we sat there and had a few drinks- we really liked our bartender. I think her name was Uylia (sorry if it's misspelled).. Anyways I had a good time, there was a nice atmosphere. More people showed up because it was happy hour and we still were able to get new drinks and pay our bill within a good time frame.

This place was awesome. I liked choosing any plate of sushi on a whim. When something delicious scrolled on by- I just grabbed it. What a great idea! It makes for a speedy lunch. I went here with my boss because his kids love the place. Well it just so happens that I love sushi, too! It was cool to check out a different sushi place than the usual RA or Stingray.

The food is really good. I can recommend like 5 dishes that anyone would like. If not, try the soup and salad bar. My favorite dish is the Chesapeake Catch, but their Ultimate Chicken Sandwich and California Club Quesadilla are amazing also. The staff works well together and the managers know the value of loyal customers. The GM was GM of the Year before and he wants to make sure every customer who leaves is happy. The kitchen staff is also great.  Keep up the good work!

After a great meeting at CO+HOOTS, my boss and I decided to check out the Grilled Cheese Food Truck parked outside. We split the Grilled Mac and Rib and a side of perfectly crispy tots! I know these sandwiches are probably not on my diet, but sometimes it's worth a special treat! I tried the bloody mary ketchup and it was a little spicy, but really good. I also had to have a side of regular ketchup for dipping my tots, but that's a personal problem. Some have called me a ketchup addict. Maybe, but I happen to think it's under control!    Good idea for a successful small business. There aren't many people that don't like a good grilled cheese sandwich. How about a little tomato soup on the side in the future? Sounds like an amazing combo to entice men and women, alike!

They have a super fun patio with a great view of Mill Ave and A Mountain, it's perfect for when the weather is nice out in the fall and early spring. The booths are large enough for a big group to gather around a table and all see each other, which is nice. You don't always have that option at a bar.   To drink: I ordered a Dark and Stormy and it's just like a Moscow Mule except with rum. I highly recommend it!   To eat: If you are hungry, I'm a big fan of the Thanksgiving Dinner burrito and it's plenty to share for two.

Sometimes you are just craving Mexican food and want to try someplace new. Well I wouldn't recommend this place. They do not serve alcohol, which is weird because who doesn't want a margarita with their tacos? The menu is very confusing and even shows drinks, but they are all non-alcoholic. The service was very slow and not very good. The whole experience was mediocre, which is disappointing because I love Mexican food. A LOT!

Excellent, quality sushi. I am a big fan, but sometimes you come across a place that makes you a little unsure. Fear not sushi lovers! Squid Ink will not steer you wrong. In fact, they will most likely be able to help you decide on a delicious roll and make you laugh at the same time. The vibe of this restaurant is awesome, too. It's new and modern with a sweet mural of a woman with octopus hair that I could not take my eyes off of. Loved it! Honestly, everything was wonderful and I can't wait to go back! Who's down for a sushi night? I know what I'm ordering!

I had a wonderful dining experience here on the day of Phoestivus. I must admit it was my first time at the cafe, but I had attended Foodtruck Friday many a times during my ASU Cronkite days. I was excited to finally try out the menu!   I loved the pork verde pot pie - it was kind of on the spicy side, but I paired my lunch with a nice apple cider to wash it down. That's right! This cafe has a bar! Cool points again!  The vibe of the whole restaurant was like your moms kitchen back home, but run by very friendly, energetic and outgoing employees.  After finishing my lunch I was walking around taking some pictures of the Phoestivus event and some of the morning employees were having lunch. One of them named Lauren (same name!) struck up a conversation with me and offered me a bite of a croissant she just bought from the bakery. Although I was extremely full from my meal, she talked me into it! The croissant was the best thing I've ever eaten. It was flaky, buttery and delicious I was so thankful she gave me a chance to try it!  SUGGESTION: The only thing I could suggest is to have access to more restrooms during events like Phoestivus. Maybe rentals outside? There was a long line all night at the bathrooms and there was much confusion about the unisex option with customers. I heard many gentlemen say to everyone in line, "I'm just going to go find the men's room," as they cut the line. It was a tad bit frustrating.   Besides that one suggestion, which is probably only an issue during these kind of events, I loved the Phoenix Public Market Cafe and can't wait to go back to try something new and fresh!

I went to lunch with my friend and he suggested Coney Grill. I loved it! Great service, awesome food and a fancy soda machine! I got a Double burger because the pattys are small - 2 ounces and the burger was perfect for me! Also the fresh cut fries are super yummy! Definitely worth a try.

Take a look on the website ahead of time and you can plan to hit the lines when they are shorter. I went in last week for an emissions test and I was finished in less than 10 minutes. I passed, which is a great feeling! I'll be back in 2 more years!

I thought this was still a Tempe Bicycle location, but to my surprise it's not!   For you that are new to Tempe, there are multiple Tempe Bicycle locations and in my experience they have hit or miss customer service. I thought it was cool to check out a different bike store for a change.   I was buying some accessories for my bike, so I don't know about prices on bikes, but for what I bought it seemed reasonable. Friendly staff and quick service.

I really had a blast at this event. I've been to Outback a million times, but I liked mingling with old and new Yelp buddies while trying the new bar menu! I like the sharable portions and affordable prices. It's good to know there will be a yummy happy hour that I can afford every day of the week!   My favorite part was Yelp bingo. I think it's hard to break the ice, but get us going and the fun begins!

A great new addition to ASU's neighborhood! This location is new, very clean and kinda stylish even. There is a neat little patio outside that would be a great spot for lunch with friends or even a short business meeting. Inside there are many seating options and it's a decent size, probably able to handle a crowd after a football game or night out on Mill Avenue. I love Chick-fil-A! Just pray and wish and hope you don't crave this delicious fried chicken snack on a Sunday!

Riverview Park existed before, but never like this! As the Cubs Spring Training Stadium was being built, the adjacent park also had a facelift.   Now the park offers something for everyone! I love to take my dog for walks around the lake and watch the ducks and geese swim around. Or throw a football around in the field with my boyfriend. For kids, there is a super cool playground with a huge Spiderman web to climb and a little water park splash pad.   The design of the park is very atheistically pleasing with rows of palm trees, bridges and curvy sidewalks making for a good spot for family picnics, bike rides or a quiet place to read a book. The parking situation is a little confusing upon the first visit to this park. My suggestion is to figure out which area of the park you want to hang out and find parking close to that. The parking near the playground seems to be hard to come by. If you live close to the park, maybe ride a bike!

In my opinion, the best Chinese take-out in Tempe! Every now and then I crave Chinese food and Beijing Express is sooo good! I love the Sweet and Sour Chicken, Egg Rolls, Crab Wontons and Beef and Broccoli with brown rice! Everything is always cooked to perfection with extra sauces. Delivery is quick, but I live close by and sometimes opt to go pick up the order so I can eat quicker! Don't forget the handful of fortune cookies that makes Chinese take-out complete. With these guys on speed dial, the future looks good and so does my dinner!

WAYNE'S WORLD! WAYNE'S WORLD! Party time! Excellent!  What a great movie choice for the first Yelp Secret Cinema! We laughed our butts off at Film Bar in a fun private showing of the 90s classic Wayne's World!   The event was as casual as a Tuesday evening, but way more fun! We had dinner from Short Leash Dogs and a free drink on the house! I went for the chicken dog and added some of my favorite toppings and a sweet pear cider.  Now, I was all set for the movie!   Lindsey wouldn't tell us the movie before it started. Duh it was a secret! We sat in suspense for a minute, but when the opening credits started many Yelpers had a clue! It's funny, my plus one (Leigh C.) had NEVER seen Wayne's World before. She was just a tot when the movie was popular and it was hilarious to see a person watch Wayne's World for the first time! Good pick!   Party on Yelp!

If you want to get your body in amazing shape, then sign up for an Orange Theory Fitness class! They help you stay motivated with a guided class led by an enthusiastic trainer. You've heard the phrase, it hurts so good? Yep! I definitely got my butt kicked in a good way! Upon arrival, we were given a monitor and strap to attach around our ribcage. It was cool to see how hard your body was working out compared to other people in the class. It told you what percentage of effort you were putting in, how many calories burned, your heart rate and other important details. The gym also has upbeat music playing during the workout so you don't even need your headphones.   After we were done sweating it out in the gym, it was time to refuel at a nearby restaurant, which happened to be a super cute and healthy restaurant called Flower Child. Everything about this experience was amazing. From the staff, to the food, to the decor and the entire vibe of the culture. I love the way the menu is set up, you can order a bunch of sides or a salad with toppings, or a wrap or whatever you want. I tried the Flying Avocado wrap and a cup of kale, barley and mushroom soup. We were also given samples of Kombucha and yummy green or orange juices to try. They even have Kombucha on tap, which is pretty darn awesome if you ask me because I don't know any other establishment that does that! We were even sent home with a delicious lemon cake for dessert. I had to share this with my boyfriend, who couldn't make the event, to give him a taste of how amazing Flower Child's food really is! Next time that I'm looking for a lighter fare or maybe after a nice hike at Camelback, I will definitely return to Flower Child. It's the kind of food that fills you up without making you feel stuffed! What a perfect combination. Thanks to Yelp, Orange Theory Fitness and Flower Child for everything!

A few years ago, I tried scuba diving on vacation in a resort and it was a very stressful situation for me. I wasn't sure if I would ever try scuba again.   A friend of mine told me about Destination Scuba and it changed my perspective on the world of scuba diving. Before I was afraid of scuba and felt rushed because I never had the chance to learn at my own pace. Destination Scuba was the complete opposite and has great instructors that know how to handle a scared little guppy like me! The ocean can be overwhelming, but also amazing and beautiful and given the chance to learn the basics of scuba with calm dive instructors who want me to enjoy it just as much as they do- it was just priceless!   Another cool aspect of Destination Scuba, they live up to their name! They plan many dive vacations throughout the year in tropical destinations. Sounds like the perfect excuse for a trip to the Bahamas- if you ask me!

I was excited to check out the new Scottsdale Thirsty Lion! I have only been to the Tempe location once before and I heard the Scottsdale Fashion Square location had just opened up. Our server Gary was super friendly, outgoing and able to answer questions about the menu. We ordered draft beers and my lunch date was happy they had Sculpin IPA available and I went for a tasty Crispin Apple Cider per my usual sweet tooth.  The menu - We loved the bacon wrapped prawns!! They tasted like they were grilled to perfection and who doesn't love bacon wrapped anything?! A must try! The salad under the prawns was even quite tasty and I commented on how I never usually eat the little appetizer salads. This was like a cole slaw that tasted nothing like typical cole slaw.  Next I ordered the Salmon Risotto and it was so creamy! Good stuff! I also tried a few fresh cut fries and believe me they are worth cheating on your diet for the afternoon! Thank you for a great experience!  We sat in the bar area at a table with comfy stools as we chatted and watched sports highlights and music videos on huge flat screen TVs. There is a second bar area which is located in the restaurant. It looks like it could probably service a decent amount of thirsty lions! Can't wait to come back for happy hour!

I loved this bar when it was in Scottsdale and now that it moved to Tempe, I'm even more stoked! I'm a skier and I love the vibe of this bar, it feels like you just stopped in for a cold beer and hearty sandwich after hours of hitting the slopes.   Kudos to bartender Justin, he was attentive, funny, but had a very chill personality. He was doing his thing working behind the bar, but would check on us and chime in on a play in the football game to make us feel acknowledged. The food is amazing and the patio is huge with lots of space to play fun, outdoor drinking games. Order the fried pickles or pretzel with beer cheese and wash it down with a $3 Lodge Lager - Mmmmm!  I wish this place was here years ago when I lived in the neighborhood, because I felt the previous bar that was in this spot was not very welcoming. The Lodge is way more my style!

This is a huge bar. They have about 4 individual bars between restaurant and patio so you shouldn't have trouble getting a drink! I ordered my beer in a stein mug - hey when in Rome! It was heavy, but I liked attempting to chug my beer like I was at the true Oktoberfest. They had pretty good food, but while tasty it was also DRIPPING with grease. It's hard to enjoy when you want to run to the restroom and wash your hands after each bite. There was also a food truck on the patio, that's pretty cool and it's nice they have different options - order from a server or a food truck, pick whichever bar you're closest to, I could see some major drinking holidays successfully taking place here - (think St. Patty's Day, Oktoberfest New Year's Eve and ASU games)! Cheers!
