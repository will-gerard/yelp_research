Bungalow was great! I will probably start going a couple times a month. The service was great. Everyone was friendly. Atmosphere was super cute, mellow, and classy. Happy hour is great. $2 domestic beers. They also have a "skinny girl" menu with tasty items/drinks. Food was yummy. Everything was perfect :)

Mellow Mushroom is a great place to go for happy hour drinks. They have reverse happy hour every night. Half off all drinks starting at 10pm! The bartenders and service is great, plus the food is yummy as well. It's a great place to get "super mellow."

Loved RnR. I went last Sunday around 12. There wasn't that long of a wait and they have bottomless mimosas and bloody marys for $14. Even though it was packed the servers were quick to refill. Fun atmosphere and a nice patio with an upstairs!

Atmosphere was normal. Service was great. Food was awful. Nothing outstanding enough to return to this restaurant.
