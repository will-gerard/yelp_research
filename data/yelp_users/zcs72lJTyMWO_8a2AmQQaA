Place is awesome! Great live music going, one man band. Had spinach and artichoke dip that was good.  Margaritas were excellent, shots were great and to top it off they took $5 with Veebow app!  Good times!

Best boba smoothy I have had!  Must try, go early because for some reason they run out.  Should really knock a few stars off for that reason~

Waited 45 mins for artist to show up in cab, then he said he didnt want to do the tattoo.  No review on tattoo work never made it that far.

The managers here are complete clowns!  Should be fired on the spot, using the F word in front of customers, not professional.  Avoid at all costs!

Avoid at all costs!  New owners suck!
