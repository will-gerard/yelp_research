I'm a big fan of Chris Bianco's food and this place is really good!  I had a soup and a sandwich and left pretty pleased with a full belly, a smile in my face and my wallet didn't suffer.  I will have to go back to try more items of the menu!  Cheers.

The place is just beautiful with great service.  Perfect for a date or a private conversation.  The food was good but not impressive. Food wise I would give them 3 stars but the place and service made it up for the 4th.  I had the asparagus salad and the salmon. both were good. Period.  The bread was really good, though.  They have a great wine selection and the prices aren't that bad.  I'm a sucker for Riviera del Duero and they have plenty of them. Funny fact, the fist one I selected wasn't available.   Cheers.

You can't go wrong with this place. I mean, don't expect the best place ever, just bring a humble taste, sole cash and good company and you won't be disappointed.  I gave this place 4 stars basically for the service and the ambiance. The food is a little above average but nothing to impress.  The service is kind and the decoration of the place is really pleasant.  A good place for a date or friends and family, although a little over priced (for the food).  Cheers.

This is a great place for breakfast, although it gets pretty crowded and parking can be a nightmare.   Solid kitchen, good dish selection, all in all a great place.  Why 4 stars? A little too pricey for what you get.

This place is a pretty solid 4 stars!  Great location and ambiance, friendly service and great food.  I ordered the caprese salad which was phenomenal. I usually like balsamic vinegar with it, but I didn't dare to ask for some (maybe next time).  I also had the Fetuccini Contadina which was pretty good.  Tiramisu and coffee were also outstanding.     My friend had an out of the menu pasta with pork belly which was pretty good although a little too salty from my point of view.  The wine menu (by the glass) has only Italian options. Although it's an Italian restaurant, I would appreciate certain variety (but this is just a preference).  BTW, the bathrooms are clean, and with a great decor.  Cheers.

The food was just OK. The miso super super spicy, like noserunning spicy.   Service wasn't great. The table slightly smelled like a dirty cleaning cloth.  And the WORST of all they had a DJ with super loud music. AYFKM? Who wants a DJ in a sushi bar/restaurant? It was just annoying.

The kitchen table for kids is the bomb. I loved it.  Good food. Humongous servings and good taste. A little pricey, if you ask my opinion.  Spaghetti with meatballs and penne with added shrimp, really good.  Rosemary side potatoes could be skipped.  Colossal brownie Sunday, well, colossal and delish.  Cheers

I'm not a fan of sea food, but this place is a must. I call it "the best spot to recover from a hang over", no kidding. This was my 3rd time and I was as pleased as the last 2.   Try the toritos (peppers filled with shrimp and wrapped in bacon, on a soy-like sauce). Three of those plus a "michelada" (beer with lime juice, clamato and salt) and you'll be better than with an IV. You can also try the shrimp broth, it takes you back from the grave (the booze grave).  The shrimp cocktail is great, with fresh cucumber. Pour some lime juice and ask for ketchup and you'll be thrilled.   My brother had the shrimp wrapped in bacon, there were pretty good.  The service was pretty good and friendly. Actually I went there with a friend who has several restaurants and restaurant experience and he pointed out that the service was better than average.   One note. If you're white supremasist, a mexican hater, kkk, confederated, Arpaio lover and so on, this might not be your place. Most of the patrons are hispanic and also all the waitresses.   I almost forgot it, they play "banda" music which I find hideous but the food worth the music pain, specially if you're hung over.  This is as close as you can get to the real mexican seafood restaurant that could be found in Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Ixtapa, etc.

Lovely family own restaurant. A true neighborhood gem.  Awesome service and really comfortable.  They have more high tops than regular tables so be aware if you go with kids our elder people.  I tried the calamari, cauliflower, custom pizza, pineapple Canadian bacon pizza and the lasagna. Very solid and well presented dishes.   Be aware, servings are big.  Fit desert I had the chocolate lava cake with hazelnut ice cream. There was no hot chocolate filling :'( the I've cream was delicious though.  Highly recommended and we'll be back and try other dishes (beet salad for sure).  So the missing star is because there's room for improvement. Which for them will be really easy to do.  Prices are fair.  Cheers

What a discovery. True neighborhood gem.  Don't get fool by the location or the looks of the place (it looks that it has have better days), the food is really good and the prices are decent.  I has the Greek salad, the great Italian sub and the Hawaiian pizza. Everything was great although I wouldn't go for the pizza. Don't take me wrong, it's good but the rest of the food is better.  Don't forget to check the vintage refrigerator out!  Cheers

I was on my way to a different joint but I've been curios about this place for a while.  I won't lie, what made me walk in was the beautiful girl who was behind the counter who is super nice and efficient (the phone was ringing constantly and she was taking orders on site and over the phone).  That being said, I wasn't sure what to order but the guy in front of me ordered the gyro salad and since that sounded kind of healthy I ordered the same.  I was really pleased with the flavor, the presentation, the quality and the price.  I'll go back for sure!  Cheers

Let's start with the pros. Quaint little place hidden in Mesa AZ. Nice front bar and reasonable prices. Pretty decent wine list.  About the food.   The bread wasn't good at all. Period.   I had the caprese salad wich was OK, barely OK.  I ordered the capellini with erbe sauce. The rosemary flavor was a little overwhelming but in general was OK.  I wouldn't crave to go back but if I lived in the neighborhood, I probably would go once in a while.  The best part of dinner, was the company  (as it should always be:)  Cheers

The drive is long but it's worth it.  The place is really charming and the people kind.   The bread with jelly was delicious as well as the pork beans.  BBQ ribs were pretty decent but not the best ever. The ham and chicken were more in the average spectrum. It seems that they use canned pineapple for the ham, which is super sweet and gives an artificial flavor. The ham was also a little too dry. The chicken can be skipped.   It's a good place to go for a day. Once you're there, don't miss the ghost town that is just 1/4 mile away.

The caprese salad was pretty good.  The lasagna was good but way too greasy, I guess the cheese did the damage (to my diet, lol).  Good coffee.   Good service although a little slow.  Great place in Chandler if you don't have too high expectations.  Fair prices.

For me it would be more like 3.5 but when it comes to round up, I guess CC deserves the upgrade.  We ordered everything to the center, as one of our friends likes to say, "sharing is Karing (typo intended, local joke :)  We had the pork chop, the mushrooms, the porkbelly, mac and cheese, and flat iron steak.   All the dishes were pretty good. The mushrooms had avocado that was ripe and firm (hard to find a good avocado and they nailed it).  The pork chop was kind of dry, hard and lacked flavor. The flat iron steak was good but a little salty.  The pork belly and mac and cheese were pretty good.   Good wine (pinot noir from Oregon at 15 a glass).  So the food would be a solid 4 stars (specially because it wasn't like crazy expensive considering each one had 2 drinks of our party of 3). What I didn't get is why to put so much stuff in a good dish? All the garnishes were plain and uneventful.  The decor and setting doesn't go with the food, from my point of view. We were sitting like in the middle, by the bathroom and the kitchen divided by an ugly curtain.  The service was OK.  All in all, a good place.

I've been in this place several times and it's one of my favorites for several reasons.  The prices for what you get are great, nice ambiance and good servings.  Tip: They have special prices at the bar, and it's a great place to sit for parties of 1-3.  We had the short rib (bar portion) and stuffed mushrooms to share. Nothing not to  L-O-V-E of this dishes. The mushrooms are in a thick cheese sauce and the brisket in a juice that you can soak the garlic bread to reach a food nirvana.   I also ordered the file (11 oz) with gorgonzola sauce and fries. WOW. Seriously 5 people around me were drooling and asking me how it was. The guy next to me said that he would order that next week.  But be careful, the servings are pretty generous. I ended up leaving like 1/4 of the filet.  I strongly recommend to order several dishes to share everything, you know what they say, right? "Sharing is caring".  Again, don't expect a fancy pretentious place or up-scale restaurant. But the food quality, servings and price point are unbeatable.   If I have to complain about something, I believe the restrooms need to be updated.   Cheers.  PS This place was part owned by Sammy "the bull" Gravano's wive back in the day, which gives it the feeling of the Italian joint of the movies.

The place is awesome. I should go during the day, I guess because it must have great views. Nice decor, comfortable, a great ambiance.  The service was more in the not-so-great side, but no complaints. It's just that for an upscale restaurant I would expect a better service.  The mai thai was pretty strong but good. Bone marrow was interesting but the species and sauces kill the marrow flavor completely. The short rib was pretty good but the serving is way too big. The mac and cheese was tasteful as well but I would prefer it on the side instead of under the short rib.  I will definitely go back.

This is a hidden gem.   The great company might influence a little bit in the rating but it deserves every single star.  The place has a great ambiance with artwork all over the place. An open kitchen with the chef cooking and greeting the guests.  The service was really good and the bathrooms clean (which, at least for me, is pretty important).  The booth were I sat was unexpectedly deep/plush although very comfortable.  The house pinoit noir was meh, but no complains.   The starters were terrific. Ceviche was tasteful and a nice portion. Ba Mie Goreng was also super tasty. We shared both dishes so a couple of extra shrimp would be appreciate (I'll ask next time for extra shrimp to have 2 per person).  Finally I ordered a special, the short rib. It was delicious. Maybe too big of a serving but that's OK.   Next time I might order more dishes to share since the entrees are pretty big.  BTW, the desert was normal size, which is always appreciated!  Definitely a must.

I used to like this place but today it was a big fiasco.   I asked for a table inside but I didn't know that they have a section that looks like a pizza parlor in the middle of Idaho. I was expecting to be seated in the main room but that didn't happened. So we moved to the patio. The weather was hot and I didn't notice anything that could help (idk if there were misters but it wasn't that great).  I had a heffeweizer and it got warm pretty quick, but oh well.  The edamame was good, crispy and tasteful (I always order edamame without salt).  But the spinach salad was bad. Lack of taste, the spinach was flavorless, the dressing was boring, all in all a bad salad.  My friend ordered enchiladas that were ok if you overlooked the presentation (it looks gross, pools of grease, it could look like dog food and the metal dish doesn't help at all).  Anyways, bad salad, bad experience and kind of price for what I got.

After like 2 hours debating where to go, my buddy decided to go here.  I had a beer, a cup of chilli, and Arnold Palmer and a BLDA.  One of my friends had a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon and curly fries (which I tried as well).  The verdict:   The place is a neighborhood dive (at least the patio, since we didn't go inside), nothing impressive but comfortable.    The chilli was just an OK. My friend's sandwich was OK minus. So why four stars?  The BLDA (A stands for avocado) was delicious. Super crispy bacon, full avocado flavor, I mean, everything was good about this sandwich. The curly fries were also pretty decent.  The service and pricing just OK.  The Arnold Palmer wasn't good at all plus the straw was TOO short for the glass, that's pretty annoying.   *Note. I asked them not to put butter in my bread, idk if they do that, but my experience was without butter in the bread.

I ended up here by accident (not a happy accident).  The burger was half decent and the fries OK. The chicken tenders didn't taste like chicken, WTF? I thought almost everything tasted like chicken.  And the price, oh boy, over $21 for 2 meals of cheesburger, soda and fries, plus chicken tenders... No thanks.  Cheers

What a tragedy. The security guys are ruining this cool joint.  It's the second time an extremely rude security guy mistreats me and I had it. Never again.  I believe it was the same guy, Troy or something like that. A loud, rude, disrespectful poor soul that yells without a reason and acts as a Missouri cop.  I have plenty of friends who work in the industry and when I told them about my two bad experiences they just said: Yeah, the place is cool but it's notorious for having an extremely rude and unprofessional security crew.  After the first incident I went back the next day to complain with a manager but the Sunday manager didn't care much (it seems to me that he's tired of listening to the same stuff over and over) and then I forgot to go back (they're not that important to me).  I won't go back since there are plenty of places with decent staff.

Highly recommended for a romantic dinner.  Great food and good service. Prices aren't that bad for Vegas standards.  I had the shrimp cocktail and the steak salad. Both pretty solid dishes.  Kids salmon is also pretty good.  The strudel and coffee are awesome!  Cheers

OK, after all the buzz of this place, I finally made my way in there. Let's be honest, back in the day there was a 3 hour waiting line. I only would wait for 3 hours in the ER if I'm bleeding more than half gallon per hour, but never for food and furthermore never for pizza.  So now that things have settled a little bit, it was my time to visit the place. In my crew there were 4 kids although the place is far from kid friendly, and so is the service. Anyhow, let's cut to the chase.  The menu, although small, has a good selection. The antipasto was good with one meat, one cheese, some cauliflower, red pepper, olives and a couple of other things. It was good and a nice portion.  I also had the caprese salad but I really missed some balsamic vinegar. The EVOO was tasteful but some balsamic is a must (in my opinion).  I also had the rosa pizza. The parmesano raggiano flavor dominates in a super pleasent way. I would recommend people to share because the whole thing (with the same flavor) is a little too much. Don't take me wrong, I loved this pizza but maybe would like to taste something else as well.  They don't have deserts besides a biscotte that was good and I had a double capuccino  that was good as well.  One thing I didn't like is that they don't have lemonade. WTH? I was craving an Arnold Palmer to fight the heat back but had to settle with an ice tea.  Anyways, great food, the place worth it if you don't have to wait, nice ambiance and the neighborhood is nice for a walk after the feast.  I might go back some day soon to try other pizzas.

Without realizing it, this was the very first place I went to when I first visited AZ.  Several years later here I am returning to this place almost by accident.  Let's start with the place. Modern, clean, open, dramatic high ceiling, cool bar.  I didn't drink since I was driving but I sipped my friend's dirty martini. Let me put it this way: It was powerful. Two of them would be more than plenty.  The food was really good, specially for the price.  The shrimp cocktail was great, the sauce was spicy and a great presentation.   The bacon wrapped water chestnuts were pretty good too.  We spitted a chicken sandwich with buffalo wing sauce. It came with a side of fries.  If I have to complaint about something, the fries were a little plain.  But again, the price point, the service, the place, the ambiance make this place a must.  I won't let that much time pass by before my next visit!  Cheers.  UPDATE  I went again and was as please (if not more) as the first time.   New favorite: Hell fries!!! The price/satisfaction ratio is so off that it's not even funny. We were talking of how expensive other places when it comes to evaluate the experience vs. the price.

I've been talked to go there for several weeks and I refused until yesterday. Being a Mexican food expert makes me pretty reluctant to go to Mexican restaurants outside Mexico. But oh well, I did it.  Let's start with the positive.   Great patio and dining room. A pretty cool door in the bathroom-although there's rust in the sink and it's not that clean. Service was just OK (there you go, the 2 stars right there).  What i didn't like:  1. Labeling. It's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants call food a name that it's not accurate. Tortilla soup is more a Caldo Xochitl (tortilla soup has a tomato base broth). Rompope has no tequila.  2. Food. Cuitlacoche crepes tasted good but they had an after taste of burned oil. Tortilla soup was lame and well, not a tortilla soup. Mole was thin. Chiles rellenos had like pound and a half or cheese. It was just offensive the amount of cheese stuffed in this things. Bean & cheese tacos (kids menu) were bad. Guacamole was packed with onions and serrano chile, too overwhelming (I belive it was serrano). Rompope was just alcohol with milk, it tasted ok, but nothing impressive.   The only dish I really liked was the chocolate cake. That was tasteful.   3. Price. The price is ridiculous, specially what you get for it.  Most likely, I won't go back.  The best (worst) part is that they rather not accept American Express. They try to push you to use something else. wow

What a quaint place with good food.   Friday night is hard to get a dinner table anywhere and Cibo is not the exception.  They don't take reservations so be ready to wait.    The place is cozy with a great vibe and great service. While I was waiting I was grated by every server who walked by me. They looked sincerely friendly and polite. One of the waitress with short hair and a long skirt had a gorgeous smile and was super kind, unfortunately my table was in a different table. Next time I'll try to get a table in her section :-)  The food was pretty good. I had the Omero salad. Goat cheese and strawberries among other great ingredients/ It was really good. Nice serving size too.  I also has the funghi pizza. Very tasty and a perfect serving.  Not sure about the prices since I didn't pay.  This place worth the visit for sure.  Cheers

Nothing memorable. Nice setting, average food. Fair prices.  The lamb was too salty. The fries were too little and in general the typical lame LV restaurant.  The service was OK.

I can't believe this is my first time in this great spot!  Although I was recovering from a mexican food related stomach problem, I went there with 2 friends of mine.  The place is great, the patio is awesome and the service couldn't be better. Too bad I didn't ask the waitress her name because I should send a compliment to the place about the great service :)  So I ordered a tea (I know, it sounds weird but I was sick). The tea was tasteful and the serving was generous.   After warming up with the tea and taming my upset stomach, I ordered the filet and the house pinot noir.   Both were pretty good.  The mountain of mashed potatoes could be smaller and on the side, instead of under the filet and I didn't try the veggies. But all in all it was a great experience.  Did I say how awesome the waitress was? I'll have to go back sooner than later!

This place is pretty close to the 5th star but the good news is that there's room for improvement.  The decor is great, charming and comfortable.  The food was really good. Nice guacamole, crispy chips, tasteful salsas.  I had the shrimp cocktail which worth the visit, seriously was delicious. For me, the best shrimp cocktail I've ever had in AZ.  I also tried the carne asada tacos and the tomato soup. They were pretty tasteful.  The rocky mountain desert was also awesome (but be careful, it's a pretty large serving, you might be better off sharing it).   My only two concerns would be that we had 2 extra green salsas and one of them seemed to be from a different batch, kind of right out of the fridge and it didn't taste as fresh as the previous one.  The other concern was that the beans (side of the tacos) were a little too salty.  BTW, we had a minor incident (an unforeseen kitchen issue) which was managed in a super professional way which also speaks great of this place. I mean, accidents or small things always happen in restaurants but the difference is made by the way they handle them. And this place did great!  Certainly will go back to try more of their delicious dishes!  Cheers

We have a winner!  The best gluten free bread in town (that I've tried), hands down.  The rainbow ceviche was superb and the Hawaiian wahoo was pretty good as well.  The desert was to die for. Crema Catalana with a twist, OMG, delish!  Great service as well and beautiful location.  It wasn't that pricey either, I mean, given the quality and service.   Cheers

This is my second visit to this spot and it was as good (if not better) as the first one.   Some of the ribs were a little overcooked but nothing to complaint about. The baked potatoes were yummy and my daughter (5 yr) finished her pulled pork sandwich, so all in all it was a good experience. the bbq sauce tastes pretty good and it's in a self serving warm container which I believe enhances the flavor.  The price is fair and the place is clean and appealing.   So why didn't i give it 5 stars? The sides were below lame. The mac and cheese and cheese potatoes were tasteless.  The lemon cake was too sweet for me and the corn bread was good although a little dry.  BTW, this place is always packed, so arrive early or be ready to wait in line a little bit.

What a quaint little place!  The drive through single standing building makes this neighborhood joint look kind of out of place. Put it has a great patio (dog friendly) and the decor is pretty appealing.  The bar looks great, I'll have to try it some day soon.  The food is above average but nothing to die for. I had the shrimp cocktail which was OK and tried the mac n' cheese which has a flavor which I'm not used to so I didn't like it that much.  The shrimp quesadilla was good but it's a pet peeve for me that restaurants call dishes something that they are not. This is more like a flat bread/pizza style dish. It was good but nothing to do with a quesadilla.  The browny was pretty good as well as the ice cream. But be ready, the serving is huge!  Cheers.  Ernesto L.

This place is quite an experience.  Food wise would be 2.5 stars (specially because of the price tag) but the place and service made up for 1.5 more :)  The service is amazing and the place is beautiful. There were two weddings and it looked like a lot of fun (for the guests, obviously, the groom and bride will regret that day for sure :)  I had the tasting menu. It was good but not memorable, especially because it's not that cheap. There were a mix of good and average dishes.   The cheese board, fish and desert were the best.  I'll go back for sure and will also try their brunch next door.  Cheers

What a neighborhood gem.  Great food, great prices, good service, what else can you ask for?  I mean, arriving to a packed place and half of the customers seem to be Japanese, which speaks highly about a sushi joint imho.  Will be back for sure.  Cheers

Let's be clear, the "torta ahogada" is a typical dish that is not suited for everybody.  It's a pretty hard roll filled with pork meat and soaked in tomato base salsa and then ultra super mega spicy sauce (like 3 days of stomach ache spicy if you're not used to it).  So what people need to do is first think if that's a dish they want to try and second make sure you order your torta ahogada not spicy at all and order the hot salsa on the side.  Squish some limes on top and put red onion to have the real mexican experience.   Pretty good flavor, serving and price.  All in all, it's almost as good as in Mexico.

I've heard a couple of good comments about this pizza so I finally gave it a try.   It's really good and convenient at a really fair price. I was reluctant to the "cook it yourself" approach but it's stupid-proof, it comes with directions and you can call them if something goes wrong (it didn't in my case :)   It comes in a paper tray oven friendly and I intentionally overcooked it a little bit so it came out crunchy and with a great taste.  An instant favorite!

I have ordered only peanut curry here, and it's pretty good! I like it with boiled tofu and no peppers.   The best part is that you place the order over the phone and you can pick it up in the drive through!   Great place for take out. The dine in is not my fav, but it's ok.

Oh what a happy day.   This place has everything (if you oversee that it's in f!#@$g Gilbert, AZ lol)  The farm salad with thai dressing was OK but I'm positive that next time I'll have the fresh beet salad.  But this is out of the subject.   The Fontina burger is delicious, period! Full flavor cheese, perfect meat, nothing not to love about this burger. (I didn't eat the bun since I'm trying to skip some carbs but it looked great).  The onion rings are the best I've ever tried. Not that I'm a big fan of onion rings but this ones are a mandatory dish.  The place is family orientated, nice and modern decor, the bathrooms are interesting, btw. They have some weird decor (I won't spoil it, check it out by yourself).   The price is pretty decent (if you oversee the gas to drive to f!@$#g Gilbert, AZ lol).  A great place that worth the trip.  I'll be back soon.  Cheers.

I'm starting to have some withdrawal syndrome of true authentic Mexican food.  Since I saw on Man vs Food los Reyes de la Torta and I drive by at least 3 days a week, I decided to give it a try.  I got by fix to-go so I don't know about the dine-in experience, although while I was waiting the air got a little thick from the cooking.  I tried the Hawaiian torta, the pambazo and the milanesa (breaded steak).  The Hawaiian was pretty good although the pork element was a little overwhelming. A little off from the Mexican pierna.  The pambazo was too moist and the "papas con chorizo" got lost in the other (mediocre) flavors. I would like a kick of chorizo flavor with cubed potatoes, less salsa in the bun, and less lettuce. This was disappointing for me.  The best part, the milanesa torta. It, on its own gets the 4 stars for this place. Tasteful, nice portion (could feed 2 or 3), ripe avocado, jalapenos, nothing not to love of this torta.  It's good to have something from the Mexican kitchen that it's not tacos!

I can't believe this place averages 3 stars. What's wrong with people?  This is my favorite BBQ spot for many reasons. I know, you might be asking yourself, why then no 5 stars? Well, there's always a waiting list that takes too long but they have empty tables. It seems that they haven't being able to figure out how many waiters/waitresses they need. 4th of July waiting time: 1 hour. They didn't say that the patio waiting time was 15 min and that in the bar is first come first serve.  Anyways, there's nothing not to like of the food. The wings were tasty, the ribs were great, their bbq sauces are full of flavor, and the price is right.  All in all, my very favorite bbq joint in AZ.

There's nothing not to L-O-V-E about this place (well, maybe the bill but that's out of the subject :)  It has been hard for me to fall in love with a restaurant here in AZ, but City Hall has never let me down.  The shrimp cocktail is awesome. The size of the shrimp is kind of scary, I wouldn't want to cross paths with them while swimming in the sea!  The shrimps are super clean, meaty, tasteful and the sauce and horse radish is awesome. Great starter.  I had the Argyle pinot noir which was pretty good.  I also ordered the bone-in filet which was delicious, tender, cooked to perfection (which is hard to find).  If I had to criticize anything, I would like to have a little more of light (just a notch).

This is for sure a hidden gem.  A pretty intimate environment with great service. Perfect to disconnect or for a romantic night.  The wilted spinach salad, prepared at the table is delish.   I tried the ratatouille and the portobello ravioli and both were pretty solid.   They also serve brunch on Sundays which is pretty good as well.   Good wine selection and kind and friendly service.  Cheers

Can beat good food for a decent price.   If you are looking for value for money, this is your place.   Grilled asparagus were pretty tasty. The edamame was cold which wouldn't be my first choice of temperature, but was pretty decent. Teriyaki ribs were yummy and the AAA sushi was also really good.  My only 2 complains would be the edamame temperature and that the AAA sushi is constructed in a way that every single piece separates. They might want to wrap it up with sea weed or something to keep it in one piece, just saying.   Walking around Tempe Marketplace after lunch was also super pleasant.   Can go wrong with Kabuki.   Cheers

This is one of my very favorite places. The food is consistent, the service is great and the prices are fair.   Slate martini and lemoncello are certainly highly recommended.  I had a calzone with the ingredients I always order my pizza: Caramelized onions, peperoni, goat cheese and mushrooms!  Chop harvest salad, beet salad, caprese or Melburry sandwich are some of my favs. And if you like garlic, the elephant garlic is great.  BTW, the cheese platter and the hummus are unbeatable!  Enjoy.

OK, I can't stand people saying stupid things like: So and so has a better so and so.   If you want to do ultimate sub match or a competition, go somewhere else. If I understand Yelp's philosophy right, the idea is to help people decide about a specific place  (specially if the options people give are like 15 miles away). I'm always dubious about people dropping names of other places, it seems kind of fishy or at least silly to me.  Anyways, I've been at this place several times (this location and the one on Chandler) and I've never been disappointed. Great taste, specially if you get the vinegar and olive oil. Will it get a little moist? Duh, it's vinegar and olive oil, what would you expect? Just eat it right away and enjoy.  My favorite is the Italian but since I'm trying to eat a little better, I got the turkey breast yesterday and it was pretty good.  The bathroom could be cleaner, though.

There's nothing not to love of this gem in Chandler.  The coconut soup is a must, the yellow curry is out of this world and I tried for the fist time the coconut shrimp. It was so good that we ordered a second round.  One of my favorites, for sure.

My very favorite spot in LV. A fresh alternative for all of those lame overpriced places.  Everything is tasteful here. Meatballs, salads, bread, you name it. The prices are pretty reasonable (LV standards) and the setting is cozy, charming and great for people watching.  I like to call this place the hidden gem of LV.

Let me start saying that my other 3 friends liked the place/food a lot, so it might be just me but this is what I experienced:  Service was OK. Nothing memorable, specially for a Wednesday in an almost empty place, but was OK.  We started sharing dates wrapped in bacon. They were good but after trying them I can tell you that bacon and dates don't match at all.  The honey chicken wings weren't good either. The meat was dry and the honey was... honey. It came with a mix (lime and salt?) which was super salty like in I-already-had-my sodium-intake-of-the-day salty! I didn't try the 5 slices of pepper that came with the dish.  I tried the short rib that one of my friends ordered and it was dry. I also tried the steak that another friend had and it was pretty decent. Although both of the friends who ordered steak said that it wasn't cook the way they requested it.  I had the salmon. It came with an extremely watery risotto that lacked flavor. The salmon, let me just say that I left half of it. My friends tried my salmon and din't like it either.   For desert I had the carrot cake. It was OK.  Also I have to say that the place is not cheap.  When I left I was thinking: So how does it work that my friends liked it but they complaint about how cooked their meat was? And they didn't like the salmon? And they didn't say anything positive about the wings and dates? Oh well, that's the beauty of opinions!   Cheers.  PS No wonder why they will change the whole menu within a month (according to the waitress)    Random fact. The door next to us (that goes to the patio) was opened several times and it did an uber annoying squeaking.

Face painting has become a classic at my kid's parties. Everybody loves it and Dianne does such a great job!  This last time we went to the school's county fair after the party and everybody was asking where did the kids get their faces painted.  A warrantied success!

It's interesting how a neighborhood family own restaurant can succeed, specially being in the top of the hoods. I guess good food, nice decor and great service builds regulars.   I had the uncle Louie salad which was good, nice serving and with a lot of flavor.   The penne wild mushroom was super good.  A nice touch is that the owners (I assume they were the owners) talked to us a couple of times. Not the typical annoying manager/owner who engages into an endless conversation but a gentle genuine courtesy chat.  All in all a very nice place.

The setting and location are really appealing. Nice design and good vibe.  However the prices are way higher than what you get for it.  I had edamame, tiger roll, rainforest roll and one lime (yes, they charged me for the lime), no alcohol or soft drink (just water) and after tip and taxes, 40 bucks! One of my friends dropped 108 (just food!)  Another downside is the parking. There's a public lot one block away. Add 5 dollars.  It's a cool place to hang out if you don't mind overpriced mediocre food.   The service was also pretty bad. It seems that either they were understaffed or just didn't care much.  PS They bathrooms are pretty interesting and with cool design elements but the walls are covered with FRP which make them look super awkward/cheap.

AYFKM?  If you're ready to wait, and wait, and wait to be seated and then wait, and wait, and wait to be served. And then get a below expectations food, this is your place.  Service was kind but the wait is not worth it.  Food was uneventful.   Enough said.

This is a hidden gem of Chandler!  Hand made pasta. Good service. Super decent prices. Nice patio.  I've been here several times and I always leave happy. When you have good food and good service for a great price, nothing can go wrong.  I've tried the filet, caesar salad, minestrone soup, mushroom fettucini, spaghetti with meatballs, everything has always been above average.   They also have a good wine selection with good pricing.  It seems that they use the restaurant to attract gamblers but oh well, so be it.  The only down side is that the restaurant is in the back so you have to walk to the casino and get your dose of second hand smoke which the truth being said, is not bad at all.  Cheers!  PS Just a sad note. By a reason that still beyond my understanding (specially because this rule doesn't apply and Wildhorsepass), kids are not allowed (I believe it's 21 and older)

Totally agree with the average rate of 4 stars!  Let's start with the location. Although parking is bad, there's some relieve with the valet.  The decor is great, the bar is super cool and in general no complaints at all about the lay out, ambiance, etc.  The food is good but not great. A little hit and miss (between good and very good).  The fritto misto was good, the calamari were great, not greasy at all. The shrip were good as well. The dipping sauce could be better/different though. In my opinion it doesn't go with the dish.  The roasted beet salad was pretty good but a little too much onion.   The agnolotti were interesting but forgettable.   It seems that all the food is good but nothing to say "wow" besides the desert. The sweet potato cheesecake is out of this world. I would go there just for that!  I almost forgot. The kids spaghetti with meat sauce is great. I might order this the next time. The serving is pretty generous so an appetizer and this plus the cheesecake and you'll be pretty happy.  Definitely a must if your not waiting to be impressed with food. A great place to become a regular.  As a side note it seems that they had an overstock of kale at the kitchen. It was everywhere.  Enjoy!

This is a neighborhood gem, for sure.  I've driven by several times and last Saturday I finally made it.  The place took me to happier times when I used to go to neighborhood restaurants with cousins and the kind as a kid.  A non pretentious nice neighborhood place run by a beer lover (nothing wrong with that) with a broad selection of comfort food and beer.  I had the ribs and they were pretty decent. Just don't forget to order extra sauce.  Perfect place for a quick bite or spend a nice time with good company.  Cheers!

Pretty interesting concept of a comfort semi-fast Italian food.  Nice, small, comfortable setting, clean and with good friendly service.  I had the portobello mushroom menu with a salad (mista) and the mushroom topping.  Everything was good and at a decent price.  Mental note: Next time ask them to use less EVOO in my dish.  Cheers

The ambiance and location saves this place from zero stars.  Food wasn't good at all, specially for the price. Guac was boring and chunky with unexpected (and unpleasant) textures.  The chips were oily although the salsas were good.  I had the angel hair chilly pasta with shrimp. The shrimp were good but the pasta was packed with alfredo sauce and no hint of spiciness at all.  I tried my friend's lamb rack and it was boring and flavorless.   Besides the great company and great place ambiance wise, the food doesn't worth the visit.  I'll give this place a try someday soon with hopes that it was just a bad day because the setting and ambiance are really nice.   Public service: servings are humongous, so don't over order.

What a disgrace!  The worst service ever. The waiter was lame, rude and with an attitude.   The food was pretty bad, overpriced (even for free would be too much for this horrible place). The decor is lame, the tables are smaller than a stool and so on.  They use plastic silverware and plates (which I guess is for safety purposes) but there are so many other plastic paper options than the ones they use.  I wrote in the bill a note about the lame service and the server instead of being apologetic or trying to understand what happened (he might be so dumb and arrogant not to know that he did everything wrong) he was all mockery and said "goodbye" with an sarcastic tone.  They are lucky to be at the airport, this s@#t hole wouldn't last a month in the real world.  Don even wast your time.

If you're expecting sushi, turn around and leave.  We tried several dishes and all of them were from above average to really good.   A pretty solid kitchen with a good selection of food. I tried probably 7 or 8 dishes and left the place pretty satisfied (food, quality and price wise).  The bass was probably my favorite.  The two highlights of the night were the tea and desert.  The tea had a toasted flavor which was unique and delicious and the desert (we had chocolate mousse and bread pudding) and both of them were outstanding.   The intimate ambiance and setting is pretty nice for a conversation (friends, romance, business) although the service was just OK (in this kind of places I always expect an exceptional service).   Highly recommended.

I believe this is the third time that I've this place and I already forgot all about the food. Is pretty uneventful and kind of pricey for what you get.  I had the rib eye which was burned on the outside and a little over cooked. It seems that it was too close to the source of heat or something like that.  The only interesting thing were the mushrooms that came with the steak. Those where tasteful.  Unfortunately nothing to highlight about the food.  The service was bad and it took forever. I mean, over an hour to get our food or so.  The waiter was trying but he didn't do a great job. I'm sure the kitchen didn't worked for him either.   I also tried the hamburger and it was barely OK.   At the end, I volunteered to pay my part (including some extra money for the shared dishes-calamari and fried mozzarella sticks- but then the waiter divided it by customer.  I overheard him saying that he charged somebody the wine (which I didn't try) and somebody else the shared plates (I guess I owe them some cash for that haha). I thought that was hilarious (in a wrong way).  The only good thing (I guess) is that that incident took my memory to my college years where cheap mofos always used to hit me and my friends with the bill taking off the booze (since we always drank) but divided in equal parts the rest (with all kinds of shizzle that they use to order).  It's amazing how people can forget that they had a soft drink (that it's never free), that they stuck their forks in the shared dishes, that they ordered a desert with Kahlua, fire, and ice cream made out of opossum's milk and gold paper with a tag way higher than 3 drinks.   And of course, douches always forgot that there's something called tip!  I don't need to say that when I use to go out with that people, the bill was always a s@#$ show!  Oh, the good'al years. I don't miss those douches at all lmao!  Fortunately my new friends are not chepos!

I've been trying GF (gluten free) places lately and this one has a whole menu dedicated for that purpose.   The food was actually very good and the service was outstanding. Fernando was the waiter and he did a great job!   Lobster spring rolls and filet, can't go wrong, huh?  My only complaint is that I had a reservation and showed up on time, however I had to wait about 20 min to be seated. On top of that, they gave me a buzzer like the ones you get in more casual restaurants. If they appeal to the up-scale crowd I think they should get rid of that waiting buzzer and have the tables ready.   Cheers

OK, this is the thing. Don't expect anything but some comfort food for a reasonable price. Otherwise you'll be pretty disappointed.  The decor is appealing, the food is decent for the price, the service is friendly, and all in all is a good experience. It's a best seller for kids, and there's nothing not to enjoy of this place if you know that you're going to an inexpensive place to put something in your stomach after some shopping or a movie.  Remember, this is a chain that started in Portland with the vision of feeding the family for a reasonable price focused in the whole dinner (meaning that your entree comes with soup or salad and desert).  The spumoni is delicious!  So, if you're leaving the mall or the movies and you need a quick bite that won't hurt your finances and the food will taste good, and the decor and service are great, this is your joint!

We had diner in a private room which is pretty cool, and well, private (duh). It has it's own bar and it's a great spot for parties or I guess for a romantic date (there're no cameras, I believe, lol).  The food was good, like in between of good and really good (not outstanding, though).   The service was great and friendly, but I guess this is irrelevant when it comes to a private room, I mean, if you get bad service there, the place just sucks!  We tried several dishes and i can't remember anyone that I didn't like.  The salad with steak was tasteful, the fondue was really good as well as the mac&cheese, maybe one of the best mac&cheese that I've eaten recently.   The pork belly was good too.  Short rib, steal head and filet were solid but not memorable. The filet was a little hard, if you ask my opinion but it was cooked right, which is hard to find in AZ.  The apple pie was also pretty good and a normal serving, not the typical "feed 10" disgusting kind of desert.   Great place for parties, dates or just friends dinner.   It worth the try.

What an awesome spot in an unexpected place.  Great food, great service and fair prices.  I had the special I'd the day (Wednesday is burger and shake).  The burger was good although I would rather have fries instead I'd sweet potatoes but oh well.  The coffee is pretty good too and they have home made syrups.  Cheers  Fun fact. There's a comfy chair I'm the bathroom wtf?

A barely OK if you ask me.  I went there before a Suns game and even on an event day, the service was pretty decent. That's what gives the most stars of my review.  The pretzels with dipping cheese were tasteless, the steak was uneventful and the fish and chips that my companion had weren't impressive either.  The desert was good, though.  The bill wasn't pleasant either. Over $100 for 2 without alcohol.   I guess this place really honors its name. Pretty arrogant yet just a butcher.   Cheers.

This place has a great decor, pretty decent prices, OK food and it's pretty convenient. If you don't set your expectations too high, this is a great place to grab a quick bite or meet with friends, family or for business.   If you're in a rush or just need to kill some time, their bar is pretty good and they have a drive through for take out, which is pretty convenient.  I was craving fried eggs with bacon, and I got just what I was craving. A good portion of crisp bacon, 2 fried eggs and sour dough bread. I had to order extra bread, though because it came with just 2 half slices.   The grapefruit juice was pretty good (if you like grapefruit, of course) and the latte was good as well. The potatoes on the side could improve a little bit.  All in all, don't expect a lot and you won't be disappointed.    I go to this place plenty of times so instead of writing and up-date i decided to edit this one. They DON'T have ice cream or any desert :(   BTW, their patio is dog friendly :) I don't have a dog, but I thought that was cool

Not impressed at all.  The goat cheese fondue was pretty good but the steak with chimi churri and fries was barely an OK. The service was good and the decor is really nice but for the prices, you could do way better.  They're doing a "Latin America food tour" and it was Peru's turn. I didn't have the peruvian menu but my friend who had it was pleased.   I guess I wouldn't go back.

What a great place.  I had the strawberry chicken salad which was pretty decent.  My friend had the steak bites (which look great although I didn't try them) and the fries (which were really good).  They have a great beer section. I had the strawberry blond which tasted like Flintstone vitamins.  The best part was the gorgeous, awesome and friendly waitress Cassie.   I'll go back for sure and am planning to try the steak bites.  Cheers

Hands down, this is, by far, the best Japanese place I've been in Arizona.   I tried the four course menu and everything was delicious and the presentation was impeccable.  The place is intimate with great decor and you can sit at the bar to watch the chef work.  Just be ready to drop a good amount of money, like 3 digits per person.  It totally worth the experience!

I'm not a big fan of restaurants at a mall but they did a great job with this place.  The decor and lay out is great, it feels open but at the same time you don't realize if it's half empty or packed.  I had the burger with mushrooms, swiss and the side salad.  Not great but pretty decent. Nice serving.   The kids mac n'cheese was pretty good.  Not pricey.  For sure a place to try.

OK, I've never liked any of the Fox concepts besides Sauce, and I left this place very pleased! Maybe the 5 star is a counter balance of how much disappointed I've been in the past at other places, but this place is great. It seems that italian is Fox's strong area.  The decor is cool, the integrated kitchen is appealing and all in all it's a great concept.  I had the cheff's board, 2 cheeses, 2 meats and some other goodies. The ultra thin slices of meat were tasteful and everything was good. Maybe a little bit of more cheese wouldn't hurt.  The pork belly was good. Not in the amazing side, but pretty decent.  I ordered spinach tortelloni and it was great, full of flavor and with grana padano, I mean, there's nothing not to love when it comes to grana padano.  The desert wasn't that great but maybe I was already full.  The double espresso was good.

Let me start saying that the place is great. Nice setting, great bar, pretty spacious, private dining room for parties...  Service was pretty good too.  The food was above ok but not memorable. The "food network" pizza was oily but tasted ok. The other pizza (with several ingredients) was better.  I like that the servings are fair but not massive.  My only 3 concerns were that when we got in there was a smell that I couldn't figure out what it was but it was close to a smelly rag. The men's room wasn't clean (not a wreck but not clean) and the ac could freeze an Eskimo.  Nice addition to the area.

OK, let's start from the beginning. I claim to be a Mexican food expert, so it's hard to impress me, specially outside Mexico.   So I've been refusing to visit this place for ever since I'm tired of trying Mexican places that claim to be authentic and are just overpriced lame imitations.  But since today I was in a great mood and wanted to try something new (and had to eat in the Scottsdale area) I finally gave this place a try.   The service was super friendly, on top of their game and pretty knowledgeable. Five stars for the service!  The food was great in general, but let me go dish by dish.  1. Guacamole. Well, it's not authentic but it's tasteful. The cranberries or whatever they put are unnecessary and mine was on the spicy side, which I appreciated but not everybody likes it so be careful.   2. Chips. Super tasteful, thicker than normal.  3. Steak taco. Mmmm, nobody would miss it if you skip this taco.  4. Suadero. Not 100% authentic but pretty tasteful.  5. Al pastor. Nothing to do with the real thing. Can easily be skipped unless you don't care if it's a freestyle pork taco which tasted ok.  The tacos are medium-small.  6. Cochinita pibil. This was the highlight of the night. Pretty close to the real thing, great taste. Will go back for that for sure!  7. Shrip Barrio. Open quesadilla with shrimp. Tasteful and different.  8. Shrip with avocado. Meh.  9. Tres leches. Again, not authentic and barely OK.  10. Flan. Delicious.  11. Agua de horchata. The real deal. Super tasteful!  Bonus. I asked for a sample of the mole. It was well executed, thick, tasteful. A little in the bitter side, but again, mole can be cooked in thousands of ways. I definitely will try a mole dish soon.  Price was fair. Not cheap, not expensive.  Great decoration!  Cheers!

I just fell in love with this place.  Great staff, friendly and kind. Bianco was in da' house which added up extra kuddos to the place, specially because one would think that now that he's a rock star he would be arrogant but all the contrary, he was super pleasant and down to earth.  I had the specials of the day which were delicious. Watermelon salad and gnocci with meat.   The gnocci were my very favorite, what a dish!   The desert was made by Bianco's mother herself, which was also superb! A banana tiramisu-like cake that was one of the best deserts I've had lately.   Apparently, Bianco's mother brings desert on Thursdays, keep that in mind.  I tried the wise guy pizza which was also excellent.  I'll be back within two weeks.  If that wasn't enough, the decor and charm of the place is outstanding. Rustic with a touch of elegant.  If I have to define Bianco's concepts I would say he trims the BS and focuses in food quality, which is pretty hard to find, specially in AZ.  An instant favorite for me, for sure.  Cheers!

Really interesting family own restaurant.  Be ready for new flavors. Some of them spicy.   The dumplings and deserts were my favorite. Also the meat dishes were tasteful.  Not a big fan of the rice dishes, plus the servings were family style.  The deserts worth the try, try as many as your stomach allows you!  I was invited so I don't know about pricing, but seems to be pretty fair.  Cheers

I was so shocked to learn that there're TWO bbq places just across the street of each other that I have to try both. Rudy's is the first one but I'm not planning in comparing against each other but to rate my experience.  The ambiance and decor is nice if you like the back patio setting style with big tables barn-like. I liked it but I could easily understand people being annoyed by this.  Service. A line-up service where you buy your food by the pound with the drinks in coolers is kind of interesting. It reminds me Fuddrucker's back in the late 80's.  Presentation. A huge tray without plates, all in paper (butcher paper) gives (again) that backyard family bbq appeal that can be disappointing for some people.  Price. The price is just OK, not a bargain (given the self-service and no silverware/china) but it's not a rip-off by any means.  Food. The meats were tasty but they cook them without sauce. I had lean brisket (which was pretty good) and baby back ribs. Being said that the meat is tasteful, the sauces are on the lame side. Nothing impressive and the hot and mild have a forgettable flavor.  Would I go back? Maybe.  Would I crave to go there? Absolutely not.

So I've been waiting to try this place for a long time and I was disappointed.  The only good thing was the sauce. All the meats were super dry and flavorless.  The service was good (it was a Monday).  The prices would be fair for better quality/taste but they need to work in their kitchen.  I had the brisket, ribs and pulled pork. The pulled pork was the only thing that saved the review from 1 star.

I was working in the area and decided to visit this place. I wasn't expecting much so I guess it helped.   I ordered their home specialty, Corned beef hash. I have to admit that I love the crappy Hormel corned beef canned that you can get in the supermarket but I knew that this would be a different presentation so I ordered it and sat and wait.  It happened to be pretty decent flavor, nice serving and all in all a good dish.  I would rather have that dish in a plate than in a bowl (I had fried eggs and the bowl didn't help much).  I also would appreciate the place with less smoke but I guess that's what you get in such a small place.  The bread was toasted in a band toaster without butter, which I always appreciate. (butter in the bread is a pretty bad idea for me)  The price was ok.  One last thing, wait a little before eating your dish because the dish is hot. I mean, not hot like, "oh, it's hot" more like m@$%r f@#$r I just burned my mouth and I won't taste s!#$t for a week.

You have to be kidding me! All the buzz about this place is way over rated!  The best part of the place is the place itself. Cool design, innovative, comfortable (if you overlook the AC running at 65 F).  Short and poor selection of wines, the menu doesn't make sense, the deserts are poor executed, service barely OK and all of this with a way overpriced tag.  Cheese bread at the beginning was good, probably the best executed dish (puzzle face).  I had a glass of a French wine which had one of the most awkward wine tastes I've ever tried, but again, the selection is not that great.  In their web they have a beet salad but I didn't find it in the menu. It seems that they replaced the beets for strawberries. When I asked why, apparently beets are out of season. (Really? I'm not a farmer, but I had beets last weekend in another restaurant, oh well). Salad was barely average.  Then I had the marrow bone. It was OK, I was expecting a little more of a flavor from the onion jam and the bread used was kind of boring for such a dish.  For desert I had the rum and coke. It should be called sweet bread. No taste of rum or coke what so ever. Just a spongy bread super sweet with whipped cream on the side with an unknown flavor and a jelly with a hint of lime.  I also tried the doughnuts with chocolate. The doughnuts (bites) were crunchy (in a bad way) and the chocolate was more in the side of dark than milk, so didn't love them either.  There was a guitar player for all the three tables and 4 people that were at the bar. When he was gone, a DJ started spinning tunes for the whole 7 tables and 3 people at the bar that were there when I left.  It will be hard to make me go back ever.  There're plenty of places where you will do way better for this kind of money.

OK, I know that this is a brand new spot and I shouldn't be so harsh but as I stated in my profile, I try to be as objective as possible.  Let's start with the positive elements of this place. Nice decor, great location.   Now my opinion, without sugarcoating it. Food horrible. We were there just for a quick bite and nothing in the menu sounded appealing to us (that's not the place's fault) so we ordered a bruchetta and a spinach-goat cheese-fig salad. How can you mess up tomato? How can you mess up spinach salad? Well, they managed to figure it out.   The bruchetta is "decomposed", maybe trying to follow Ferran Adria's creativity or who knows why. But the thing is that the tomato mix was in a cabbage leave and the bread was on the side with a "touch" of balsamic vinaigrette. The bread was old, hard and plain. It was like buying one of those soft baguettes at the grocery store, forget about it for 3 days and then toast it. Then the tomato mix should be called the "never been kissed" bruchetta. The fresh garlic was so overwhelming that it was painful. We send it back and I believe they didn't charge us for that (I didn't check the bill, which for 4 drinks, the bruchetta and the salad was 60 dollars).  Let's talk about the salad. Plain and boring. Lack of taste, dressing, and on top of that I ordered the "large" which was a joke. If you call a dish "large" you can't serve that portion.  The service was bad but I guess that comes with a newly open place.  The music was also totally inappropriate for the kind of place they want to offer. A cool place with good decor and music of a cheap dentist office playing at a really low volume. That fiasco forced us to listen to the most obnoxious table I've been sitting next to that I can remember. The typical wannabe with some cash to spend who was louder than a firefighter truck. Maybe some good music played at a decent volume would saved us from that annoying experience.  Ah, one last thing, the menu is like from a neighborhood Chicago style buffalo wing restaurant or a cheap family italian chain. The menu (not the items but the actual plastic menu) has nothing to do with the ambiance they want to offer.  Prices of food wouldn't be bad if the food wasn't that bad (at least the 2 items I tried).  I'll go back some day soon because I am a true believer that everybody deserves a second chance but oh my, they will have to improve pretty bad.

Let's start with the place. Nice decor and comfortable lay out.   The service was just OK.  We ordered a pinot noir from Willamette Valley that was pretty good.  Now the food.   The cheese board was good (grana padano, drunken goat and truffle tremor) but the serving was uneven. Too much grana and too little truffle :-/  The asparagus were just ok but the cauliflower steak was good. The truffle egg toast was also interesting.  I ordered the risotto of the day, which was a mushroom base. It was good but too much butter and shy on cheese. It made the texture a little too runny from my point of view.  The deserts were hit and miss. The "home made" sorbet was forgettable but the goat cheese cheesecake was super good, like to go back just for that (and then hit the gym for 6 hours, I guess-for those who hit the gym, haha)  BTW, they didn't have the pork belly, I guess this is a signal of the soon to come catastrophe of the bacon shortage!!! Somebody needs to do something. Let's cut the military budget (or somewhere else) and subsidize bacon!   I would really give this place 3 and a half stars but since Yelp doesn't have halves, i guess the rounding goes up.

Very good addition to the neighborhood.  The decor is great. The bar is comfortable and open, perfect setting to wait or just to hang out.  I had the watermelon feta salad which was unexpectedly great. The pickled onions were tasteful and the presentation is wonderful. Once in a while the mint flavor kicked in to boost the taste of the salad. If you order it, I would recommend to order it easy on the onions, unless you want to be single for the rest of your life (just saying).  The mushroom pasta was also pretty good.  No complaints at all about the service and the price was pretty fair.   The wine by the glass from Oregon (pinot noir) was pretty good.  We were celebrating a birthday and the party was pretty big, so we ended up sitting in 3 different tables. I don't know if they have a private dinning room but if you have a big party and want to be all together, this might not be the right place. In our case, we had a wonderful time and the 3 table deal worked just fine.  Highly recommended.  Cheers

I was lucky to be invited to one  of the pre-opening events and there's nothing not to L-O-V-E about this place.  The decor is just awesome, the fact that they built the place with an environmentally friendly approach (waterless urinals, power saving lighting, tankless waterheathers)  is to admire since they didn't sacrifice in looks and comfort (proof that doing the right thing can be also sexy).  I tried one of their beers, Firestone DBA and it was just delish. The temperature of the beer was great and the selection was wonderful (it was tough to choose what to have).  I'm sure this new gem of Tempe is a great addition for the neighborhood.   I can't wait to try the food!  Update: Since I said I couldn't wait to try the food, I went back and tried the sausages and the fries. I just have two words to describe it: simple & delicious. The dipping sauces were pretty tasty and original.

I get a little suspicious every time I see a really good or a really bad review of somebody who happens to have below FIVE reviews on Yelp in more than a year.   Come on, people, grow up. If you're competitors/haters, grow up. If you're BFF with the owner, don't comment or try to be as objective as you can. If you had a pretty bad experience but are not planning to be part of the Yelp community, send a letter to the manager/owner.  With Chop I kindly recommend to dismiss the nasty reviews and give the place a try.  I'm not affiliate to the place or the owners so I feel free to say what I think.  The ambiance and decor is great. The service was pretty good (Shanen I believe was the waitress name) and the food was above good.  I had the small filet, a 7 oz which seems more like a 9oz with a good side of broccoli with tasteful cheese. It was cook to perfection. My only complain would be the unnecessary scoop of butter (or some kind of rub alike) on the top.   The price was pretty decent in comparison with other steak houses.  Remember that it's a new place so they have to work in tuning things up but all in all, it's a great addition to Chandler and I'll definitely go back.  Maybe next time I'll sit a the bar to review that section of the place.  Cheers.

I always weight the price-quality ratio and this place is off the chart.  Great friendly service, super decent food at ridiculous prices.  The bar has a belt where the dishes are displayed and rotating and each plate is $ 2, yes TWO dollars.  A party of two (good eaters), plenty of food (maybe a little too much), two beers (the draft is $1.99) and a soft drink for $ 27.00  I'll be back soon!  Cheers

As a Mexican food expert, this place has a solid 4 star. Don't take me wrong, is way far away from the real thing, but the flavor is good, the quality is great, the ambiance is cool.  Nothing not to love about this place.   The salsa is great and the carne al carbon is pretty tasteful. I might reduce the size of the servings, though.   Great addition to the area!

Another great addition to the Venitian.   Good service. Good decor. Good food. Fair prices (for Vegas).   What else can you ask for?  (disclaimer, I was in Vegas mood, so this review can be either a 3.5 or 4.5 but it's definitely worth the visit!)  Cheers

I heard about this place not to long ago and decided to give it a try.  It was packed, so the wait was pretty long but it worth it.  The fresh squeeze OJ is awesome but be ready to drink some thick pulp. I like it but I'm sure it can be a shock for the american taste of the shitty artificial juice that they have us so used to.  The waffle was pretty good. The bacon was crisp and full of flavor.  I ordered eggs with the rosemary fries and bacon. Those fries worth the trip!  Cheers!  PS Great service

Since I'm personal friends with the people of this place, I'll write my review strictly about the facts.  The place is super cool and with an amazing patio.   The massive bar is awesome and pretty comfortable furniture.  Also since I'm a Mexican food expert (or at least I think so) the guacamole is by far the closest to the real thing that you can find in AZ and the salsas are super tasty.  They also have a Mega Margarita that is great for sharing (you know, sharing is caring).  Besides my friendship with this guys, I seriously think this is a great addition to the area!  Cheers  PS The bathrooms are spacious and they have a mirror, so you can check your smile without having to worry about embarrassment (to make sure there's no guacamole in your teeth)

I just fell in love (in several ways).  Great decor, clean bathrooms (which is always a plus), nice bar setting, amazing service (usually pretty waitresses are bad servers but this was a very pleasant exception).  The food was tasteful, filling, inexpensive, what else can you ask for?  I read a couple of bad reviews of people bitching about "authentic ramen" or the place being expensive. Don't listen to them. I mean, idk what's authentic nowadays, but what really matters is a good taste, and this place has it!  I had edamame with no salt but with a garlic oil, super yummy.   The bowl with tofu was also super good.   A cold unsweetened green tea was the perfect drink for that delicious dinner.   I'll be back soon!  Cheers

I was waiting to try this new spot so I finally did.  As you can tell, I'm not a fan.  I'm not a hater nor a guy who has a bad experience and opens an account just to trash a place. So this is my opinion based on my visit:  Service: Pretty bad. It was like a bizarre play with two waiters who didn't know what the other was doing. Things like one bringing more salsa and the other asking if we wanted more salsa. Or one took off to the kitchen after taking the order and the other showing up asking if we were ready to order. Awkward.   Decor: This is probable the only highlight of the place. Nice decor, different flare, pretty interesting artwork on the walls.  Ambiance: The music was super loud, the light was extremely soft (flashlight recommended) and the music playing was hideous. But come on, everything starts with the name. Joyride? Really? AYFKM? What has that to do with a mexican restaurant? The wheels on the wall might give the feeling of a joyride to nowhere.  Food: The only dish that barely approved was the beet salad (not that mexican, though). The cochinita taco uneventful (plus it's a huge pet peeve for me that restaurants use names to call dishes that have nothing to do with the real thing). Carne asada taco, meh, plus the tortilla was breaking and everything was falling apart. The street corn was a tragedy packed with butter. I tried the strawberry fresh water wich was actually pretty good although super sweet (maybe ordering one and water it down would be the right way to go). The almond horchata, same thing with the cochinita. They label something with a name that is so far away from the real thing that it doesn't make sense at all. The rice was also gooey and hard (not well done and it seems that they were stirring it while cooking)  Price: OMFG, are you kidding me now? 3.50 for a taco? And that's the less expensive one. Everything is super expensive specially for what you get.  Sorry to the team who brought this concept but there's a lot of work to do if they want to be there for the long run.

Back in the day I went to the location on Scottsdale a couple of times and I loved it so I paid a visit to the DT Phoenix location and I believe it's even better.  Great decoration, wonderful staff, knowledgeable and kind waitresses (Kiera was super kind) and really good food.  The caprese salad was superb, hands down.  I also had the Pomo pizza which was very good.  The chef (I believe he's the owner) is super kind and he stopped by our table to greet and invite my friend and I a shot of a liquor that was pretty tasty and also shared some kind of desert which was also pretty good.  A funny fact is that all the floor staff were women (beautiful and super kind women).  BTW the bar looks pretty cool as well, could be a good place for a happy hour for two.  I'll be back soon.  Cheers

I ordered the italian flat bread. It was super moist. (when it comes to flat bread, "moist" is an automatic fail of course).  I also had a latte with almond syrope. Before this I don't remember the last time I had to throw a coffee away. Yes, it was that bad.

I've been thinking to try this place for ever. I finally did and I'm sad to report that per my taco standards it's barely OK.  I got 2 al pastor and 2 carne asada tacos. I also ordered the "cuatro" (chips, salsa, guacamole and beans).   Besides the $21 that this cost me, the food was absolutely uneventful. The tortillas were cold, the beans were lacking flavor, the salsa was meh and the guacamole was average.  The al pastor tacos were kind of sweet and if you've read my comments before, you know that I can't stand the heartbreaking moment when you expect something (because they name their dish the same of something you're craving) and you get something totally different or at least far enough from the real thing.  The carne asada tacos were OK but they had this indescribable green topping that was totally unexpected (in a bad way). I don't know what it was but i believe there was some onion and celery involved. Not authentic at all, at least nothing I've ever seen in Mexico.  Veredict:  If you pass by, it's OK for a quick bite with low expectations, otherwise, I wouldn't crave it.  Cheers.

Let's start with the place. Beautiful. Open, comfortable. The bar is also great. I was waiting at the bar and saw a lot of people having fondue, very elaborated hand crafted cocktails and having a great time.  When my party arrived we tried several dishes. All of them really good. I was hoping to try the pork belly but nobody voted for that. I'll be back soon to try it, the fondue and the "super yummy nuts".  The chopped salad was very good and very unique in flavor and texture.  The duck ramen was tasteful and with a final spicy kick. Just be aware, it's a large serving.   The wild fiji tuna was also very good.  The balsamic meatloaf was original and tasteful but again, be aware, the serving is very large. I would order it without the rice or it would be good a creamy grana padano risotto, but that's just my preference.  My favorite dish was the tomato soup. Hands down.  Bread pudding was tasteful and the smoke tea chocolate pot the creme was pretty unique. I liked it but if you don't like smoky tastes, this is not for you.   A great addition to the neighborhood.  Cheers

This spot is quite a pleasant surprise. It has been other restaurants and apparently never worked until this time.  I would say that it's a hidden gem for the easy fast and good food.  Just one price no matter how many toppings you get, good taste, great salad, fair size portion. Nothing not to love about this place.  Quick service and comfortable dining room.   From the time I arrived to the time I left there was a line, but it moves pretty quick.  I'll be a regular, for sure.  Did I say that the prices are awesome?  Cheers

This place is really nice. The decor is warming, the setting is great and is pretty spacious.   The service was awesome (that's the 4th star right there). Ilana is great!  I had the leak soup which was tasteful and filling.   The peppered pastie was good as well as the rosemary garlic side red potatoes.  Prices are also not that bad.  Great place to become a regular.  Cheers!

As a disclaimer I have to say that I'm a regular at the family of restaurants that brought this gem to this awesome neighborhood, so I'll try to report just the facts.  The decor and ambience is awesome. The detail of projecting a movie in the brick wall gives the place a unique charm.  The food was as good as the location in Tempe which from my point of view is awesome. This restaurant is my daughter's favorite place as well and believe me, she's not shy to tell what she thinks!  The massive bar is the perfect place to have a drink or a nice conversation with a friend (or date).  The wine list is great and balanced with a little bit of everything to please all kinds of tastes.  Did I mention that the prices are great? Just like the location in Tempe, you couldn't do any better with twice of the money.   Yes, I have to admit it, I just LOVE la Bocca.  Cheers!  PS it's sister location across the street is awesome as well (Modern Margarita). I could live the rest of my life going back and forth from one place to the other.

Pretty solid food.  I've been thinking to check this place out for a while, so I finally did it.  I had the short rib with a side of beets with honey and goat cheese. It was delicious! The beets was a special but I replaced the grits (I'm not a big fan of grits, in case you were wondering).  Even the ice tea was pretty good.  Although it was really good it was slightly pricey for what you get and the service was good but there's room for improvement for sure.  Cheers

food wise it would be a 2.5 - 3 at the most, but the place and the coffee made it up for the 4th star.  Let me start with the food. If you've never eaten authentic Spanish dishes, you'll be pleased. Otherwise you'll be disappointed.   The olives were good.   The shrimp dish (gambas al pil pil) was also decent.  The traditional paella was good but more a risotto than a paella. Too creamy, different kind of rice (at least the texture is different) but the saffron hint and the chorizo were tasteful.  The tortilla was ok. A little burn and dry but pretty decent.  The wine selection is limited and most of the wines are NOT Spanish, AYFKM? They had one Rivera del Duero and one Rioja. Come on, you have a Spanish themed place and no Spanish wine?  Now the coffee. I tried the cold brew and the kopi luwak. Both pretty good. The coffee paraphernalia is also worth the visit! If you are caffeine sensitive, this might not be for you.  I didn't check if in the menu they include "cafe bombon", a Spanish classic. I'll go back to verify that and if not, at least to get good coffee!  Cheers

I'm usually a critic of Sam Fox's concepts but lately I'm developing a sympathy for them and Flower Child is helping.  A down to earth unpretentious cool spot with great service and good food for a fair price, what else can you ask for?  I had the asian avocado salad and the madras chicken curry.  Both pretty good. A little too much kale in the salad and little avocado if you ask my opinion, but all in all pretty solid.  I'll be back for sure.  Cheers

I went with a friend of mine who is a big fan of Classic Italian Pizza and he didn't disappoint me.  The place is clean and beautiful, the service is great and the food is also pretty good.  The asparagus with prociuto were delicious and the pizza was pretty good.  I don't know about the prices since I was invited.  The place was pretty busy and the random fact is that I crossed paths with some friends that are food aficionados, which make sense since this places is great!  i will go back soon for sure.  Cheers

What a great addition to the area. The Sushi Room has always been in my top choices when it comes to sushi and the addition of the Teppanyaki tables and the rebranding were a great upgrade.  The bbq short ribs were pretty good and the teppan was also really good. And fair prices which is always a plus.   I had the filet and it was well executed. The soup and salad were also excellent.   Friendly chef, professional staff, all in all a great experience.  The fried rice was above average.  My only suggestion is the music selection. I mean at 6 pm still a family time and listening Madonna's "I touch myself" is not what I appreciate when I go out with my kid. (at least the volume wasn't that loud and the lyrics got lost).  Just a disclaimer. Although there's room for improvement, being the first week as a teppan it really deserves the 5 stars and I'm sure in a couple of months they'll tune everything up to have a solid concept.  I'll be back for sure.  Cheers

I stopped there by accident since it was passed my lunch time and I was hungry driving around.  The place is appealing since it's a low key hole in the wall. The employees were friendly and in general in seems like a cool joint.  I ordered 2 steak tacos and 1 pibil pork. Horchata to drink.  The horchata was no bueno. Too sweet and it tastes like almond. I mean, it's half decent if they call it something else but if you've tried horchata this would disappoint you.   The tacos were bland. Period. The tortilla was cold. Nothing close to the real thing.  The salsas were tasty though.  Parking is also an issue.  Cheers

O EM GEEEE What a tragedy!  I was staying at the Paris and it's the first thing you see just in front of the elevators.  The place looks great, appealing, low key, nice decor.   Stop. That's it. Overpriced awful food.   I ordered some sort of noodles with chicken. Nothing tasted good.  My companion ordered vegetable fried rice. How can you mess that up, right? They figured it out. Just make it so salty that tastes like a shot of soy sauce.   The prices were ridiculous. I don't remember if it was 8 or 12 for a buddha beer. Either way is crazy.  Won't go back.  Cheers.

I wasn't very fond on the name and also yet another burger joint doesn't sound that appealing but I gave this place a try and it was worth it!  The fires were delicious and the cheese burger was pretty tasteful as well.   The service was OK but hey, it's a casual joint.  The shake menu looks amazing but my belt couldn't afford such crime. I'll have to be really good with my diet in order to allow me to do it but sounds pretty tempting.  Great addition to the neighborhood.   Cheers

The most impressive thing of this place is the size of the restaurant and how packed it was.  My experience though was far away from great.  I ordered a hot dog (the lady who helped me said it was their flagship dish) an also ordered a cheese burger for my companion. I also got cheesy fries.  After a long wait because they wrote the wrong number in my order (no apologize, effort to make up, anything) I told the people over there two times that I thought my order was the one that has been sitting there forever. They called the number again and finally gave it to me.  The styrofoam cup for my drink make me start thinking that that place wasn't as great as I've heard but I continued to my table. I mean, I'm not a tree hugger but styrofoam is a little too much. When we arrived to the table I opened the bag and I saw that the burger was also in a styrofoam box. I mean, even one of the public enemies, the one with the golden arches, quit using this s!@#t like back in the 80's, AYFKM, Portillo's?  Now the food. The hot dog was totally uneventful and super small (super cheap as well, but I didn't want to make the line again).  The burger also forgettable as well as the fries.  After posting on FB that I wasn't impressed, some people told me to try the beef sandwich.  I might do it and might update this post.  Not impressed at all.
