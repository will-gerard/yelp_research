I have been eating here for the past 15 years or so, and I have never had a bad experience. The food is absolutely amazing; probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. (I have to admit that I don't venture off to many other Mexican restaurants because their food is so good!) My favorite item on the menu is the #1 combo - a red chili burro with a cheese enchilada and beans. Delicious! They will certainly remain a favorite of mine for many years to come :)

I've been coming to this Bashas' location for as long as I can remember, and I really like this location! The staff are very friendly, and I never shy away from asking for help if I need it. The prices are reasonable and the selection is decent. The reason I wouldn't rate this five stars, is because you could go to Fry's or some of the larger grocery stores and get better prices and selection. However, if you're looking for a friendly neighborhood market, this place is great!  Lastly, this location has a full service Wells Fargo branch. The employees at this bank are always really nice and helpful. Overall, this grocery store is great!

I have been going to Silver Touch for the past seven years (it used to be Weiss Guys Car Wash). Over the past seven years I have never found anything to complain about. The washes are reasonably priced (about $10 for a vacuum and wash or $6 for a wash while you wait in your car), and my car always looks great afterward.  I absolutely HAVE to mention my last visit here, because I received amazing service. I scraped my car on a pole and had a significant amount of yellow paint transfer on my silver car. I took it in to Silver Touch, and they took the paint off IMMEDIATELY upon my arrival and charged me nothing. Of course I tipped the guy a $20 for his work in the hot sun, but you really can't beat that! (I should also mention that my dad received the same treatment when he took my sister's car in about a year prior to my  visit).  As far as the standard car wash goes, I have no complaints. The detail work they do at the end is always done exceptionally well. I have had a couple instances when some of the dirt or grease on my car hasn't come off during the car wash cycle, but they happily remove it when asked. For the most part, these people are soooo busy getting cars in and out as quickly as possible, that that they may miss a small area on the car every once in a while. They're only human and it happens... Here's a tip - instead of complaining about the car wash after leaving, tell them politely that they missed a spot! They are more than happy to help you, trust me!  I absolutely love this place and will continue to get my car washed, detailed, and shampooed here for many years to come!

I have been going to Breadcrafters for the past five years, and it is HANDS DOWN one of my all-time favorite sandwich spots in Phoenix! Here are some of my favorite food choices:  Sandwich: I typically build my own sandwich which I like to call Old Faithful. It is a perfect combination of turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, with their parmesan pesto spread on a baguette. The parmesan pesto spread is OUT OF THIS WORLD - you haven't lived if you haven't tried it! Their chicken salad is also fantastic. They serve it with lettuce and tomato on their walnut raisin bread, and it is great! They have all kinds of great sandwich creations, all of which I've tried. I am being completely honest when I say I haven't had a bad sandwich at Breadcrafters.  Salads: My favorite is the Napa Valley chicken salad. It has sliced marinated chicken with bleu cheese crumbles and grapes and is served with a champagne vinegrette. It's delish!  Pastries: All the pastries are great, but I love their scones and muffins. They are huuuuge portions, so you could make a breakfast out of a scone and cup of coffee. Their desserts are out of this world as well. I highly recommend the apple fritter, brownie (insanely chocolatey), lemon raspberry bars, and their molten chocolate chip cookie (it's a dark chocolate cookie with raspberry).  Bread and Dips: My favorite breads are the sourdough, french country (a lighter sourdough), viennese (an egg bread), garlic parmesan and regular baguettes. The dips that they sell are beau monde (a delicious herb/dill dip that's great with veggies), parmesan pesto (my fave!), roasted onion gorgonzola (another fave), and an olive tapenade.   As far as the service goes, everyone is always SUPER friendly. It's one of those "cheers-esque" places where everybody knows your name :) I will be a life-long customer, because this place really knows how to do good, fresh food!

This is my favorite pizza in all of Phoenix! I have been eating here since they opened in 1993, and they have NEVER disappointed me. I typically order a thin crust pizza with mushrooms and a dozen hot wings with LOTS of ranch dressing :) Let me break it down for you:  Pizza - The crust is not cracker thin, but it's not doughy. It's basically the perfect crust. The sauce has great garlicy flavor with loads of yummy spices, and the cheese they use is YUMMY! I'm guessing it's provolone?  Wings - I typically order the mild wings, and they still have a kick to them. They are pretty big, nicely crispy, and sauced to perfection :) They are delicious when dunked into their home-made ranch dressing!  They have a full bar, which is really nice for watching football on Sundays. They also have a pool table, live bands on some nights, and open mic night (not my cup of tea, but I thought I'd share it with you). All in all, this place is great, and I will remain a life-long customer :)

I love My Florist! My sister recommended it to me a few years back, and I cannot stop going. I love going on the weekend when the piano lady is there. She is amazing! The food is wonderful, great drink selections, and a really nice atmosphere. Definitely a favorite of mine.

I typically don't Yelp about fast food restaurants, but this one really deserves the five star rating! I come here during my lunch break at least once a week, and the service is always super speedy. Whether there's a line of one or seven, they always seem to prepare the food and keep the line moving quickly.   As far as the quality of the food goes, it's just like any other Subway. I do a 6" tuna on wheat, and it's always made exactly how I like it! It's MUCH faster than others locations I've visited. I will definitely continue to eat at this location :)

WOW, I am in love with this place! I have had some very expensive dry cleaning bills, so I was very pleased when my total bill was $16.75 for 7 pieces of clothing!   I took 4 dresses (3 silk, 1 cashmere), 1 pair of linen pants, 1 blazer, and 1 silk blouse to be dry cleaned on a Wednesday afternoon. I would expect to pay upwards of $50 for all 7 pieces at another dry cleaners, but not at Seville! The garments were ready for me on Friday, and they looked amazing! I believe they are able to get your clothes ready by 4pm if you drop them off by 8 or 9am that day.  Not only were the prices amazing, but the service was also great - very friendly and fast. I will definitely be switching to Seville for all my dry cleaning needs!

The food here is delicious! I had the bruschetta, chicken parmesan, and tiramisu, and would highly recommend all of them. I would rate this place five stars, but my server was not very friendly and they were out of the wine and dessert I wanted :( If the rating were based purely on the food, they would definitely have the full five stars! I will definitely be back.

I LOVE SAS for the great deals, but they definitely skimp on the customer service. It takes a lot to upset me as a customer, but this location is pretty bad in that area.  The store is a little cluttered, and I don't believe they have air conditioning or heat. It's very uncomfortable in the summertime, but I'm willing to overlook that for their great, low prices.  Now to the bad part - the customer service. There were about three people working midday during the week, and it took me about ten minutes to check out. They are extremely slow, and were chatting to each other while I was trying to finish up in line. I really don't appreciate when I'm in a hurry (as everyone is at lunchtime midweek) and the cashiers are taking their sweet time talking to each other instead of taking care of the customer. It's very disappointing and upsetting. If I were the type of customer to throw a fit in front of management (which I'm not at all) this would be the place to do it.  I really feel like management needs to do something about this, because it looks like most of the negative reviews on Yelp are due to the poor customer service.  Sorry SAS, but I will definitely NEVER go back to this location...

Wow! I typically wouldn't think of a 24-hour Philly cheese steak restaurant to be anything special, but this place is NOT typical!  I stumbled in here at around one in the morning after a night out with one of my girlfriends, and we decided to grab a couple cheese steaks. I ordered mine with cheese, mushrooms, and onions. It was absolutely delicious!! I have to admit that I had a few drinks that night, so I wasn't sure whether the sandwich was amazing, or if I had fallen victim to the beer munchies. So I ate the first half of the sandwich, and I decided to save the second half for lunch the next day. The next day I heated up my sandwich and it was just as good as the night before.  I was recommended to eat at this place by MANY of my friends, so I'm soooo glad I decided to try it. I love the Philadelphia Sandwich Company!

I have been eating at Butterfield's since it opened a few years back. It has quickly become a family favorite, and I always order the same thing - it's hard to stray from sheer perfection! I build my own omelette consisting of ham, cheddar cheese, and mushrooms with hashbrowns on the side and a big ol' glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. This is the best omelette I've had in Phoenix/Scottsdale besides the Ritz Carlton - and let me tell you, I have had MANY ham and cheese omelettes :)   However, I find it odd that they call themselves a pancake house. My family and I do not like their pancakes, nor have any friends that I have brought to this breakfast spot. They are crumbly and lack the buttermilk flavor that I look for in a perfect pancake.   Overall, the omelette is SO good that I can easily forego the pancakes. The service has always been great and the food is delicious - this will continue to be a family favorite!

A few colleagues of mine and I went to Taggia for a working lunch, and I was VERY pleased with the service, food, and general atmostphere.   When we first entered the Firesky resort, I was amazed at how beautiful it was. The entrance into the restaurant was lined with a gorgeous marble fountain, and we were promptly greeted by a very friendly server. He was able to accommodate us with the best seat in the house for four of us to work on our laptops. The wi-fi was free, which was the reason for choosing the firesky, and it was very spacious for the four of us.   Now for the good stuff, the food! I split the caprese salad and the margherita pizza with one my co-workers. The others had the cheeseburger which they both said was delicious. The caprese salad was wonderful!! The tomatoes were ripe and juicy, the basil was very fresh, and the mozzarella was perfection. I don't even know where to begin with the pizza. It was heaven on a crust!! I can't imagine why people wouldn't care for it unless thin crust is not their thing. We wrapped up the meal with a piece of tiramisu, which was heavenly. I am a big tiramisu lover and this one is definitely in my top 5.   Overall, the server was very accommodating and the food was very well priced. I believe the pizza and salad came to just over $20. Most importantly, I was extremely pleased with the food, and I will definitely be back for lunch again!

Let me preface this review by first saying that I am by NO MEANS a barbecue expert. I like what I like, and I don't like what tastes like crap ;)  My boyfriend and I were having my parents over to his place for their first time, so we wanted to get their favorite - good ol' bbq! Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with Dickey's. We ordered one of their family packs which is definitely a good deal for the money. I believe we paid $40 to feed 5 people - not bad!   The XL family meal came with 2 orders of ribs, bbq brisket, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, coleslaw, and bread. The only good part of the meal was the ribs, bread, and brisket. I didn't care for the bbq sauce, because it was a bit runny for me (I like really thick, syrupy sauce!) The beans and coleslaw were decent, but the macaroni and cheese was terrible. I LOVE a good macaroni and cheese, but this was a disaster. VERY bland and very boring.   As far as the service goes, I took the food to go and the wait time was decent. I definitely backed up the line when picking up my order, and I think they could have been more efficient. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back to Dickey's. A bad mac and cheese is a deal breaker in my book!

San Felipe's Cantina will always have a special place in my heart. I've been coming here since it opened, and I haven't been disappointed yet! Here's some of my favorite things about them:  Happy Hour - San Felipe's has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You can't beat that!  Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and they're quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works!  Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipe's is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. It's a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)  Overall, this place is a lot of fun, and I really like the laid back vibe. I'll definitely be back!

I have never been a huge fan of Mediterranean food, but I am officially converted!!   Let me start by saying the Gyro house has the best chicken gyro I've ever had!I would definitely agree with the other reviewers that aesthetically, this place is not something to look at. It's located in a small strip mall and the restaurant itself is not the fanciest. However, it definitely has character. It looks like your run-of-the-mill small, local business. The owner was in the store when I went in, and he was super friendly and I received great customer service.  Now for the good part... the food! I ordered a chicken gyro with french fries. Both were delish! The chicken was very tender and was served on the fluffiest pita bread I've ever tasted. It was topped with lettuce, tomato, red onion (which I picked off), and tzaziki sauce. I paid about $7.50 for my meal, and it was definitely worth every penny. If you're a fan of a great gyro, this is the place for you!

I have been to Fifth and Wine twice, and I had great experiences both times. The first time was for drinks after my graduation from ASU in May. I had a group of about ten people, and we sat in the comfy couches in the back. I had already eaten dinner, so all I had was wine. The wine was $5 a glass during their happy hour, which was a pretty sweet deal. We got great service, ambience, and drinks, so I decided to go back.  I was back a few weeks ago with my sister for lunch, and the food was FANTASTIC! We decided to split a bottle of sauvignon blanc, the cheese plate, and the plate of four bruschettas. Everything was marvelous! The cheese plate had figs, ciabatta slices, and three types of cheeses (I can't remember the cheeses we chose). The best part of the meal was the bruschetta, which I've listed below in no particular order.  1. Mozzarella, tomato, basil, balsamic vinagrette 2. Proscuitto, fig, mascarpone, tomato 3. Smoked salmon, creme fraiche, capers, onions, dill 4. Hummus, saffron oil  For dessert, we split the cheesecake with berries and the brownie dessert. The cheesecake was creamy and delicious, but the brownie stole the show. It was one of the best brownie desserts I've ever had! It was chewy, soft, and rich, and was topped with a heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Overall, I would definitely visit 5th and Wine again for the great food and service. Keep it up!

This review is strictly for reBAR, because I did not eat at Bliss. I very rarely give out one star ratings, but I very rarely get terrible service.   I came in on a busy Friday night with two other people, and I went to the inside bar to get a drink while they went to the bathroom. As a side note - the bathroom is in a really weird location, so the line extends out to where people are sitting at tables.  I stood at the front of the bar and ended up waiting for service for 10-15 minutes, which is completely understandable, except for the fact that I was watching everyone get served except me. I was beginning to think that it was me, since I was watching people left and right get cycled out at the bar. I finally got the courage to raise my hand and ask for three beers. The bartender, very rudely, snapped at me saying, "you will wait your turn" I understand that the bar was busy, but even the guy next to me commented on how long I had been standing there. After that, I left and went to the bar outside. The bartender promptly served me immediately upon arriving and even bought one of my beers to make up for the bad service.  I never send food back, I'm a good tipper, and I'm friendly to servers. I am NEVER a rude customer, so I was extremely disgusted with my treatment. I will never be back.
