I've noticed some of the reviews say best for older children but i've been taking my son since before he could walk and absolutely love it! He has the greatest time. Even though he doesn't quite understand the science behind everything, he loves running around and pressing all the buttons. The weather machine is his favorite. During the warmer months he loves playing in the ball fountain. We started going here after getting a free cultural pass at the library and loved it so much we ended up getting a membership. It is definitely worth it to get a membership. We go a few times a month and it never gets old. You can find discounts on memberships on living social before the holidays. We've gotten our memberships for 50-30% off over the past two years.   If you have a toddler best time to come is when school is in session and after 1pm. This place gets packed with school groups in the mornings.

This is one of the best kept secrets of Phoenix. The food here is fantastic and the service is always great. My inlaws love it here so we go a lot and everything i've tried has been delicious. They regularly change their specials so I recommend trying one of those. On my most recent visit we ordered the porkchops, clam pasta, clam stuffed lobster tail, and lobster ravioli. They were all delicious! The lobster pastas were VERY rich so a little goes a long way. The clam pasta was great and had lots of clam. I should mention the prices are very reasonable and you get a ton of food. On top of the meal, you also get soup and salad. We always order appetizers and instantly regret them after getter the soup. On our last few visits, the soup has been a lemon bisque. Honestly with a loaf of bread the soup could easily be served as it's own meal. Now this isn't a trendy Italian place. In fact if you're under 50 you'll probably feel like a youngster here but that's always what I love about it. You will feel like you walked into a different era and everyone seems like a familiar regular.

Living in Midtown Phoenix we have a lot of trendy breakfast stops that offer top notch meals, but with those top notch meals comes higher prices and long waits. Some days you just want cheap eggs and pancakes without a ton of effort. Scott's Generations is my go to for these days. I love walking in and automatically getting the feeling that you're in a mom and pop diner straight out of a Seinfeld episode (they sell black and white cookies!) The service is always friendly and fast. The food's not the best in town, but sometimes basic pancakes and eggs is all you want and they do it well. But don't expect to have fancy pancakes with lots of add ins like other nearby pancake places. So if a basic breakfast or lunch is what you're looking for, I would definitely come here.

I'm one of the few who still loves the feeling of holding and reading an actual book vs an ebook, but I'm also trying minimize clutter in my house. So the library is perfect! They have a large selection of books even new releases. If you're on top of things you can put yourself on a waitlist for the newest releases in books and movies. I started getting more reaquaitned with library when I had my son. I wanted to get out of the house and do something but found that every time I left my home I spent money. I wanted to be able to leave my house and not feel pressured to spend money. So one day I stopped by the Century library. I had forgotten how many resources they have. I was able to get books for my son, a book for me, and a movie to watch with my husband later.   I also found out they had free baby and kid programs so I started taking my son to those as well. I loved it! Ms. Tracy is typically the librarian who leads the programs at Century which include, story time, songs, games and child playtime. Ms. Tracy is excellent! She's very patient with the kids and offers lots of ideas for home play. These programs are also great ways to meet other parents. They have weekday and weekend programs.  The library also offers culture passes. These are passes you can check out to visit local museums such as The Science Center, the zoo, the art museum, and the children's museum. Each library only has a limited selection per day so get there early if you want to check one out.   The library isn't just for those who love paper books as they offer ebooks you can check out as well. They even have Nooks you can check out.   The Century Library may be one of my favorite places to go and kill time. I highly recommend checking it out and utilizing all the amazing resources they have.

The staff here is great and normally make my drinks perfectly. As everyone else has stated, the parking and drive through are a mess. Getting in and out requires another level of patience. But if you go during off peak hours you can typically get in and out pretty quickly. Overall it's one of the better Starbucks I've been to.  Skinny caramel machiatto is the best!

I originally went to the place thinking it might be similar to another Swizzle Inn I first visited on a trip to Bermuda. It's a pretty popular destination spot in the BDA, so I thought for sure there would be some relation. Well after visiting, from what I can tell, nope there's not. Not even close. Looking for a rum swizzle? You're probably not going to find here. Looking for cheap drinks in a unique midtown bar? Look no further and head here. Yes, this place is a dive but I think it prides itself on this title. It's no tropical destination but after filling yourself up on some good eats at one of their more popular neighbors, this place is definitely a good "go to". The service is always pretty quick and friendly and you can get some awesome drink deals. I can typically find a table or stool and the regulars all seem pretty nice. When i'm ending a night and just want a cheap drink, i will definitely head here. It's become one of my favorite neighborhood bars. It's not going to bring back memories of sitting on the beach drinking rum, but it will definitely leave you with good memories overall if you can remember the evening the next morning (cheap drinks go down a lot faster).

We normally just order take out from here and it's always very good, but since it was Valentine's day we decided to eat at the restaurant as a fun treat for my son. We hadn't been since the remodel and we were very shocked at how nice the dining area looks now. We had rarely eaten at the restaurant previously because it felt too cramped, but now it's definitely a lot more open and inviting. Since it was a nice day, we sat outside which was also very nice. Our table wobbled quite a bit but our served fixed that quickly. The only negative about sitting outside was there was a man who kept comimg outside to smoke, even though it cleary says no smoking all throughout the patio. We were not affected since we were far enough away, but other tables asked to be moved inside due to his smoking. I was surprised that none of the employees said something to him. Makes me wonder if he was also an employee.   When we order take-out we normally get the Brooklyn, which is our favorite.  A 16" is normally a good size for the three of us. This night we decided to order our own 8" pizzas. My husband did the brooklyn, I got the chicken pesto, and my son got the cheese.  If you're hungry get a larger pizza. The singe pizzas are very small. For me, it was perfect, but my husband was still pretty hungry at the end of the night. If you have a bigger appetite I definitely reccomend ordering a larger size. Overall the flavor was very good on all three.  Drinks, I ordered their locally brewed Phoenix St. ale and it was very good! my husband had a mojito which was too sweet. We had a coupon for two free cannolis. They were less than impressive and I was very happy they were free.  Overall NYPD is one of our go to restaurants for pizza and if you stay away from the mojitos and cannolis, you will not be dissapointed.

I shop almost weekly at Trader Joes and had never noticed that next door was a Greek restaurant. I'm not sure how I passed it each time but i'm happy to have finally found it!  I came here with my book club and was able to quickly find a table that would fit our group. We ordered drinks and appetizers right away. For apps we had the hummus platter and the greek fries. The hummus was very good but I couldn't keep my hands off the Greek firies. They were delicious. A mixture of fries, cheese, spices, and a sprinkling of lemon. All the flavors were perfect and I couldn't stop popping them in my mouth.   For dinner I had the Gyro with a side greek salad for dinner. I nearly licked my plate clean. One of the better Gyros I've had since moving to Phoenix and the salad was perfect. My group had a mixture of different things but the salads stuck out the most to me. They had very generous portions amd everyone seemed to be very happy with how they tasted.  It only lost a star from me because the service was pretty slow. Lucky we were enjoying our conversation that we didn't mind waiting around, but if you're in a hurry be warned. They definitely take their time here.   Overall it's a great little restaurant! There's plenty of outdoor seating and the prices are very reasonable. I can't wait to go back!

When looking for fresh baked goods to feed a crowd or just my family, Barbs bakery is one of the first places I turn. They're donuts are not too cakey and not too soft. I always try to eat just one but find myself eating way more than I should. When ordering a cake for a special occasion I always call Barbs. I've always had great service and they're decorator is very talented. I always get tons of compliment from my guests whenever I use Barbs for special events .  They're red velvet is my favorite in the valley. I would recommend getting there early if you're looking to buy muffins, the last time I went they only had a handful left. If you need special treats for any occasion I highly recommend Barbs! Oh, and their pricing is extremely reasonable. I just ordered donuts and muffins to feed about 10 people and only spent about $10.

I love bargain shopping so I have a tendency to visit Frys and Albertsons instead, but I love the cleaniness of this Safeway and their selection of products and wine. Although their regular prices can be a little high, they do have the best weekend deals and coupons in their Wednesday circular. If you plan ahead, Safeway is definitely the way to go. I now like waking up early on the weekends and collecting my deals. It's always fun to see your percentage of savings. My goal is to one day make it about 50 percent!

For fast food, list location is pretty nice. They get you in and out pretty quickly and I've never had a problem with the food. It also feels cleaner than most fast food restaurants I've been to. Maybe because it's a fairly newer location. My son would give it five stars because he loves their happy meals. I like their grilled chicken wraps a lot and their coffee is also very good. When I'm craving iced tea you can't beat their $1 pricing. Overall I'm a fan! As good as fast food can get!

I feel very lucky to have found Pediatric Associates. I've heard horror stories from other friends about experiences with their pediatricians so I know how rough finding the right doctor can be. A friend recommended Dr. Padrez so I decided to give him a shot. From our first visit I have felt nothing but confidence in him. He has a great demeanor with my son and I have so far had a very healthy little boy. What I like most about the office is how efficiently they get you in and out on time. There is no need to get there more than fifteen minutes prior to your appointment. Having waited over an hour at other doctor's offices, I thought this was huge. There has been an occasion or two when I've had to wait longer, but both those instances were when my son was sick and we had to come in for a last minute appointment and the doctor's did their best to see me as quickly as they could. When my son is sick, I have had to see some of the other doctor's in the practice and so far they have a;l been great. Dr. Day, Dr. Lococo, and Dr. Kelly have been my favorites aside from Dr. Padrez. The office has a separate waiting area for sick and well children which is another feature I greatly enjoy. If you're looking for a great pediatric office I would definitely recommend trying them out.

Suzanne's is a great spot for a bride on any budget. They have a large selection of dresses and the staff is extremely helpful. Suzanne was very friendly and easy to work with. I absolutely loved my dress and it fit like a glove after all the alterations.  Just as a heads up to the brides out there looking for a dress, budget in the costs of alterations and having your dress pressed. I paid about an additional $200 for these fees that I was definitely not expecting. I would highly recommend Suzanne's as a place to start in your dress search.  Mahalo Suzanne!

On weekend mornings we head over to Orange Table simply because it's one of the few places we've found that we can take our dog and they make him feel extra welcome.  I only gave it four stars because the food is nothing to be excited about but it's not bad. The atmospere is great and I enjoy the coffee. I would highly recommend the Mojo, a mixture of expresso and chai tea. I will agree with the other reviewers that the service is a little slow, so go to Orange table if you're not in a hurry and want a place to sit and relax.  The servers do make you feel welcome and don't rush you out like other restaurants do during the weekend rush.

I went to roaring fork for a Sunday night happy hour with my husband and had a great time.  I had a glass of wine $5 and my husband had a mojito $5.  We spilt the happy hour cheese burger and guacamole, both were yummy, but we regretted not ordering the happy hour rotisserie chicken. It looked delicious and was a nice sized portion! I'm definitely going to go back and give it a try.  You have to sit at the bar to get the happy hour prices, but the ambiance there is just as nice as sitting in the main portion of the restaurant and the service was still very attentive.

This is definitely not a place I would recommend. The lady giving me my pedicure cut me twice! Although the owner was very friendly the lady giving me my mani/pedi was rude. I definitely agree with the other reviewers in regards to the clealiness of the salon, it's pretty dingy on the inside. I will definitely not be going back.

First, why is there always some jerk in front of you who decides to try every flavor and savour each taste. Drives me nuts. Please don't be that person and be couteous to the people waiting behind you. Yes, you should try a few flavors but please don't be rude. Now having said that, I love the gelato spot! We go often and try new things every time. I've only had one bad flavor and that's the salted caramel. Just too salty for my tastes but i've heard it's pretty good if you mix it with a slightly sweeter combination. One scoop is normally good for me and my family. I definitely reccomend stopping in here and trying one of their flavor combinations.

I really wanted to like Tammie Coe, the decorating is beautiful and she does a lot for charities, but after several attemps I just don't like the flavor. The last time I ordered a TC cake, I took a couple of bites and threw it out. It was sooo pretty, but I just couldn't stomach the flavor. I've also tried a few of their items at LGO, but everything was dry. Maybe they just spent too long on display, which is probably what their cakes should only be used for.

I went here on a pub crawl after being turned away from an overcrowed Majerles during one of the Cardinal's game. I was surprised to find the place nearly empty when just down the road Majerles had people falling out the door, but after ordering a few round of drinks I soon found out why the place was empty. The bar tender and manager were annoyed by the size of our group. When most empty bars would probably embrace 25 people walking in the door wanting to order drinks, the Stoudemire's staff seemed overwhelmed and annoyed.  The restaurant is nice and clean, and the drinks were good yet overpriced.  I would defnitely not reccomend it for large groups.  For people looking for a good sports bar downtown head to Majerles because the patrons there seemed to be enjoying themselves and the staff seemed to enjoy having business.

This is probably my favorite place in Phoenix. When me and my husband need a quiet night out we go here and find a quiet place at the bar. We love being able to watch them cook and they have a great wine list. If you go, you will smell like smoke when you leave, but i love that woodfired smell and don't mind it at all. It's a seat yourself place, so if you see a seat grab it and don't be picky. You can't go wrong with the carne adovada but you can go wrong with the salads. Stick with the good stuff, this isn't the place to eat healthy.

This is one of my favorite places for finding gifts for friends. They always have a fun and unique selection of items ranging from jewelry, clothes, books, and childrens items. I recommend following them on instagram or twitter so you can stay on top of their sales. I love taking people here from out of town because they have a great selection of locally made items.

I absolutely love coming here to watch movies. Being able to pick my seat ahead of time and have a cocktail while watching a movie is awesome! The icing on the cake is the 21 and up cinema suites.  The food isn't bad but I normally eat elsewhere before heading here. If you're drinking, go for beer or cocktails, the wine is typically warm and a little overpriced. The beer gets you the most bang for your buck especially if you get a pitcher.

Don't let the name fool you, Urban Cookies offers way more than cookies. They also serve, donuts, muffins, cupcakes, scones, and breads. And for those looking for gluten free/vegan options, they have a ton of these too!   I found out about Urban Cookies after a friend shipped me a box while I was in the hospital. For anyone who's had a lengthy stay in a hospital, you know almost daily you get treats. Urban Cookies was by far one of the favorite treats I received and one of the few the nurses agreed to take off my hands as I couldn't finish the whole box even if I had tried. When I left the hospital I was excited to find out that Urban Cookies was located just a few minutes away from my house! Score!!  When I finally had the chance to visit their bakeshop, I was shocked to see they had scones, breads, and cupcakes! The scones are definitely my favorite of all their baked goods. The lemon scones are perfect for a spring brunch. They are soft and crumbly and probably the best scones I have ever had. They have a wide assortment of cupcakes. My favorites have been the brown velvet, smores, and Irish cream.They rotate out their baked goods selection depending on the season so check their online menu before heading over.  On my most recent I saw they were selling gluten free/vegan donuts. They were very good but a little more cake like than what I'm used to for donuts. They're not my favorite donuts in Phoenix, but definitely very good. Those looking for gluten free and vegan options will not be disappointed.   And lastly, they sell the most delicious pies on Thanksgiving. For the past two years I've ordered their pies for Thanksgiving Dinner and have been very pleased. Their Pecan and Pumpkin have gotten a lot of compliments from our guests and they're homemade whipped topping is just perfect! I love that Urban Cookies uses lots of locally sourced ingredients which makes me feel less guilty about the extra calories I'm consuming.

I don't understand the people who don't like or understand the light rail. I think its a big step in the Valley embracing being a big city. I live near the light rail route so maybe I'm biased, but having the light rail has gotten me more out and about trying new restaurants downtown and in Tempe. It's a nice ride and a great cost savings on game nights.

Great food and drinks.  The service was excellent! If you go with a group of four or more on a Saturday night, plan to wait about an hour and 30 minutes, which really wasn't that bad as there was plenty of space on the patio and the bar tenders were quick at pouring the drinks.

Stopped at Earl's last night for a last minute happy hour. The inside of the restaurant had an older upper class lounge setting which I enjoyed. I also really liked the outside fireplaces. The staff was friendly and our waitress stayed on top of getting our drinks out to us quickly. I also enjoyed that their happy hour went until 6:30pm. Gives those who work plenty of time to enjoy the HH prices.  The roasted garlic flatbread was very flavorful but small. They could make it slightly larger for sharing. I would definitely give this place another try.

Love Bertha's! My husband is a regular here and probably hates me reviewing his well kept secret, but Bertha's is just so tasty that I can't resist. Their sandwiches are phenomenal , but for those of us who feel the need to eat salads but never feel satisfied, you will love the salads here. They're nicely sized portions will fill you up and not leave you feeling quily. If you go at lunch, get there early. The line starts getting long around 11:30. The only negative thing about this restaurant are the people who let their co-workers cut in line during the lunch rush. Does this bother anyone else out there???

I really like this theater. I live closer to other theaters but when I don't want to splurge on the comforts of the esplanade, I head here because the seats are very comfortable and they offer a larger variety of movie times. When I need a break from the family, I love taking advantage of their am showings. There's never a crowd around 9am and I can enjoy my movie in peace. I also like taking advantage of their am showings when I decide to take my family with me. My son naps midafternoon so a 9am showing is perfect for us! Plus at that time no one is really hungry so we can save money by not buying snacks. Overall a great theater!

This is a great park. The playground is great for kids and my son loves watching the ducks. It's also very dog friendly. In fact, it loses a star from me because the city hasn't made part of it into a dog park yet. In the early mornings lots of people like to let their dogs run free. There's so much open space at the park so the dogs don't usually interfere with regular park goers. I just wish the city would finally turn at least part of the park into a dog park so the rest of the playground stays dog poop free. Granada has beautilful views of squaw peak and is always very clean. Definitely one of my favortie spots to take my son.

Stopped in for a weekend lunch and a beer. The bar tender was extremely friendly and the crowd of regulars all seemed to be having a great time! I ordered a blue moon and cheese burger and my husband ordered the ham and cheese. Both meals were solid.  The Baer's Den is righ across from a new ASU student housing development and according to the bar tender, it's pretty interesting to watch the drunken coeds on Friday and Saturday nights go crazy. But for us older yelpers, there's no need to worry about them interrupting your bar experience. None of them are old enough to get in so you can enjoy your beers in peace.

I've been going to see Chanele for about 3 years now and always have the best experience. She if amazing if you're looking for a great hair dresser. The owners are also extemely friendly and welcoming people.  If you need a salon for your wedding party, I would highly reccomend this one. They did my wedding hair, six bridesmaids, and my mom's hair in under two hours and everyone came out stunning!! I will post pictures so you can see how talented the staff here is.  Thanks Salon Krush for keeping me beautiful!

Went here for a couple of drinks on a Tuesday night. The drinks were good and had decent prices. The bar tender was also very helpful. I guess Hanny's is opened by the same people who brought us AZ88 which makes me want to come back and try the food. They are also one of the only restaurants in downtown Phoenix serving food past 10om. Who knew?? I would also recommend going to the bathroom before you get a few drinks in you. Just like AZ88, the bathrooms here are a major part of the restaurant experience. There are no tvs here which I kind of liked.

Went to Postinos with our Light Rail Pub Crawl group and was highly impressed with the service we received from the staff at postinos. It's rare when a restaurant is able to provide seamless service for this large of a group, but the staff works well as a team and it shows! They got us seated and fed right away. All the food was delicious and great for sharing! They had a $7.50 pitcher of hoegaarden special that was too good to pass up. I highly reccommend this location as good place for groups.

I agree with the above comment. I live in the neighborhood as well and was very excited to see Arcadia Tavern open, hoping it would still have the neighborhood charm of Western Pizza and Red Tomato. I was wowed by the size of the place and the number of flat screens, but unfortunately the food and service were so so. I've tried to go back several times but each time the parking lot is packed and there's no space at the adjacent lots. Who exactly is filling up these spaces??? The restaurant never looks busy from the outside...Due to the lack of parking at Arcadia I found myself ending up at Blackforest Mill and Jts. Both of which I have found to have great food and great drink prices. So to those who will probably venture to Arcadia Grill like I did and be turned away by lack of parking, head over to one of these bars instead. I think you will be pleasantly surprised by the food and drinks.

Living in walking distance to this place, I often overlook it when choosing a restaurant for dinner. Living in Phoenix it's easy to get caught up in the new restaurant hype and forget about the good standbys. Luckily for me, my sister was in town and asked to come here for dinner since is was 5pm on a Friday and neither of us wanted to sit in traffic just to try something else. When we got to the restaurant we were seated immediately which surprised us since it was happy hour on a Friday. The patio doors were open so even though we were sitting inside we were able to enjoy the beautiful spring weather outside.   We started off with a couple glasses of wine which were each $2 off for happy hour and the Fritto Misto which was $5 for happy hour. The wine was very good. They have a decent wine selection and it's not a terrible deal at $2 off.  The Fritto Misto was lacking in a little flavor but it wasn't bad. For dinner we ordered the happy hour pizzas which were $7.99 each. This is definitely the best deal for happy hour. You get a full sized pizza that is more than enough for one and almost big enough to split depending on your appetite. We ordered the Pesto Pizza, The Pepperoni Pizza, and the Cheese Pizza (for my son). They were all very good! And not just good for being happy hour. I had forgotten how well they make their pizzas! In fact I'm kicking myself for not going here more often.   The service was also excellent. Towards the end of our meal it was starting to get busier but the wait staff seemed to be keeping up with the demand. The restaurant is also very kid friendly. I noticed quite a few people had young children so if you're looking for a child friendly restaurant, I would definitely recommend The Parlor. I will definitely be back and look forward to trying more of their menu items.

I loved Smeeks! If you're looking for a novelty birthday gift I would go here. They have such a fun assortment of items. They even have a wide variety of klutz books which were my favorite as a kid. As far as pricing. they seemed pretty reasonable to me. Nothing looked higher than it should be. I will definitely be going back.

I've now been to Tommy V's a few times and each time I have had excellent service and food. On my first visit my husband and I split their sicilian pizza. It was delicious! One pizza should be enough to split depending on your appetite. On our second visit I had the Lasagna and it was another winner. On our last visit we each ordered on own pizza because we were extremely hungry, but regretted it. It was just too much food. The pizza tasted a little more salty than I had remembered but it was still very good. The guy sitting next to us ordered their mushroom pizza and it looked delicious! According to the bartender it's their best pizza. Next time I head there I will definitely be giving it a try!

I love this spot for breakfast and lunch. It's run by a Mexican family and serves Mexican food, but it's also a great spot for a traditional American breakfast and lunch. I took a family member today who was from out of town and she loved it! We both ordered the French toast breakfast which comes with eggs, bacon or sausage, and chips and salsa. Sounds like a strange combo but I always crave something sweet after eating something salty, so the chips are a great start! After the food came my cousin and I quickly cleared our plates. The French toast is made perfectly here and my bacon was the right amount of crispy. The staff here is very attentive and always made sure we were taken care of. I've been here a few times before and have had some of their Mexican menu items and the cheese burger and all have been very good. This is a great lunch spot if you have multiple people who can't decide on what to eat.

Humble pie has become a go restaurant for my family. When I became a parent I was worried we would be relegated to eating at places like Red Robin until my kids were in college. As a "foodie" this deeply concerned me. I made the decision that we would train our kids to be well behaved in a restaurant so we could continue to have fun dining experiences. Well, that didn't happen. My son is one of the pickiest eaters and as never ending ants in the pants which makes sitting for long periods of time a challenge. Thankfully for me there are places like Humble Pie. My husband and I really enjoy the pizza and my son seems to enjoy all the food on the children's menu. The location on 7th street has a trendy vibe and if you can get a seat on the patio, there's always great people watching. On top of good food in a cool atmosphere, they're fast and kids eat free on Sundays!! If you're not a parent, you will really enjoy Humble Pie for their food and drinks, but if you're a parent and want good food in a child friendly atmosphere, look no further than here! It's a win for everyone!

Can you really go wrong with a fox restaurant? I don't think I have.. They're always been pretty safe choices whenever we pick restaurants and North was no exception. We started with a bottle of wine, Barbera. It came uncorked which I found strange.  Waiter said bartender opened. Maybe my restaurant friends can tell me if this is normal or not? Back to the food.. We ordered the calarami. It was alright. It's a litte too crispy and you really can't taste to calamari at all. I had the Strozzapretti as my meal. It was delicious and not too rich. There was also plenty of grilled chicken in the dish so the pasta didn't feel overwhelming. My husband had the Spinach Tortelloni. He loved it but it is very rich! I tasted it and thought it was great as well. We both agreed the Strozzapretti was the better of the two. Parking is mostly vallet unless you park across the street. Overall great experience!

I started my love of food trucks with Luncha Libre. On a random visit to Urban Cookies I noticed there was a food truck that had a luchador painted on the side. Being Mexican, I was instantly curious. So I grabbed a quesadilla. I was in heaven. It was delicious. The salsa was perfect and the quesadilla was just the right size for lunch. I even grabbed one of their luncharitas. Also delicious. I'm lucky to live nearby a few of their stops so I try to stop whenever possible, although these days fewer times than I'd like thanks to my waistline. If my pants allowed it, I think I could eat at their truck everyday. I should confess, that quesadillas are one of my favorite foods, but even then, luncha libre's are the best. Their staff is always super friendly and they get you your food fairly quickly. My favorite is the their steak and blue but my husband swears by their hamburgers. Be warned, these might induce a nap/coma. They're big and delicious. You can follow them on facebook, twitter, and instagram to learn their stops for the day.

After passing this place numerous times, I finally had a chance to visit for brunch. It's a basic breakfast cafe. Nothing too fancy but not divey either. A perfect place to meet friends for a quiet lunch or breakfast. It's also very child friendly. I had the california chicken sandwich and it was very good! It was a nice sized chicken breast , with bacon, cheese, and green chile. I've never had green chile on a chicken sandwich and it was sooo good!  I couldn't eat it fast enough. I ordered my son the chicken fingers which were the right amount of chicken and breading. My companions both had french toast and were very happy. The service was prompt and friendly. Overall a fun experience that I will definitely try out again.

This is a great concept and works well if you're flying out of terminal 3 or 4. If you're flying out of 2 this is such a pain! The train does not have a terminal 2 stop but the shuttles will not take you to the east economy lot from T2 so you have to take a shuttle to terminal 4 then catch the train from there. Sounds easy unless you're dragging luggage up and down stairs like I was. Took me 45 min to get to my car after the plane landed. I'm hoping the phoenix city council is working to fix this problem. Use Blue Sky if you're using terminal 2. Way easier!

My husband of all people stubbled on this place when looking for a birthday gift for me. He knows I like jewelry and came into this store and saw they had reasonable prices and a great selection. I absolutely loved the necklace he picked out and wear it all the time, so for Valentine's Day he went back and got me a gift card so I could check it out myself. When I walked in I was surprised that it was a clothing boutique not just a jewelry store so I decided to look at dresses since I was going to a wedding that night. The first dress I tried on didn't fit so the sales lady came over to help. I told her I liked the dress but too tight. She asked me more questions about what I was looking for, then when and found me two other dresses she thought might work. The first one she gave me fit my body perfectly! She hit the nail on the head on her first try. Then she took me too mirror and gave me suggestions on how to wear it with stuff I might have at home. I was sold. I swear there are people out there who have a gift for helping people feel good about themselves and she was definitely one of them. I wish I had gotten her name.  I wore the dress to the wedding and received a ton of compliments and the best coming from my husband :) Thank you Alixandra Collections, I will definitely be back!

Whenever I want a plain coffee i go here. I always get in and out quickly and the baristas are always super friendly. I'm not a huge fan of their flavored lattes but you can't go wrong with their plain coffee. It's delicious

I stopped here for my friend's birthday last night and really had one of the best nights out i've had in a while. For not paying a cover, the band here was fantastic. They had people on the dance floor all night. The dance floor is a pretty good size for people to have fun and move. The drinks were delicious and very reasonably priced. I noticed a small little section of the restaurant right off the dance floor that looked like it was reserved for a private party. I would highly recommend checking it out if you have a birthday or bachelorette or something coming up in the future. It seemed pretty private but right off the stage and dance floor so you're still part of all the action. The service was also pretty fast and on top of things. This is definitely a place I will come back to!

I was very excited about this opening as i've been to their Denver location a few times. It did not dissapoint! We went on opening day and the food and service we great! I'm fairly picky so I stuck with the plain'ol and it was perfect! My friends swear by their more adventurous pancakes so if you're into experimenting i've heard they're delicious.

Went here for a last minute dinner with my husband and son. I was surpised at how similar it looked to the old baja fresh. I was expecting more of the original decor from the other locations. I ordered the grilled chicken vampiro. I wasn't sure how big it was so i asked the cashier if I should order 1 or 2. She said a lot of people just order 1 but if you're really hungry order 2. I was very hungry so I got that and a carne asada taco. At about $3.50 each I was shocked at how small they were and even more shocked that the cashier actually said one could fill me up! They were both good but not worth the price. My husband got the carne asada burrito which he thought was good and a better portion for the price.   Over all the place seems like a more expensive knock off of baja fresh. Plus all the table were dirty.

This is specifically for the buffet not the store..  I've tried the breakfast buffet twice now and the dinner buffet twice and every time the food is cold, stale, and flavorless. We live down the street from Whole Foods so I keep trying the buffet with hopes that it will improve because it would be such a convenient option for my family, but every time it's been bad. So save your money or stick with their freshly made foods, juice bar, or coffee shop. Stear clear off the buffet. It's overpriced and just not good. The salad bar looks fresh too, so i would probably recommend that instead as well.

If you can actually get a pie they're very good, but everytime i've gone they're out of pie. Seriously, how is a pie shop always out of pie? And if you buy a groupon or living social, good luck using it. I've been here three times now and each visit has been completely chaotic. I managed to get my hands on the pecan bites during my last visit and they were very good but after 3 visits that just had my head spinning from lack of options, I won't be back.

I went here for lunch the other day and ordered their Roasted Vegetable and Hummus sandwich and it was much better than I expected! I'm normally a meat eater but had been eating bad all week and decided I should order something "healthier".  I wasn't in the mood for a salad so I decided to try it and I was sooo pleased I did! It had so much flavor and was very filling! I didn't miss the meat at all! I didn't try the macaroons on this visit but have had them at their tempe location and they are fantastic! I will definitely be back!

So happy there's finally one of these in the north central area of Phoenix. They're a great pizza option if you want to pick something up and eat it later. If you want a hot pizza to eat right away there are better options in the area, but if you're trying to plan a meal ahead of time this is such a great place. I would recommend ordering one of their delite pizzas. The crust cooks perfectly and the delite topping choices are amazing. I absolutely love their chiicken bacon artichoke delite. It is one of my favorites! I feel like their regular crust pizzas cook up a little too doughy ( at least in my oven) so I prefer the delite crust since it bakes up more crispy.

I really liked this new location and enjoyed the pizza as much as always. I had the mushroom pizza and it was great, One my companions had a personal pizza and the consensus was that it had a digiorno like taste so stick with the medium pizza or larger. Their homemade cookies are also delicious!

For the price, it's great pizza! We just ate here for the first time tonight and had the wings and a pepperoni pizza. Both were very good. It's a small location with minimal seating so your better off getting the pizza to go. We'll definitely be back.

All you midwesterners will love the stadium. It's pretty big and definitely has much better parking than Hohokam.  Those who have actual seats will be able to enjoy the game without sun beating down on you the whole time. All the seats were pretty well covered by shade by 2pm. Good news since most of the games are at 1pm. Bad news for those who enjoy lawn seats. If you're planning on sitting in the lawn, be warned you will be in direct sunlight the whole game. So bring a hat and plenty of sunscreen. The party deck also gets a ton of sun as well and is pretty far from any of the field action. For those familiar with Wrigley, it's the quivalent of sitting in the rooftop seats. The outside of the field is also very nice! Nice of fun places for kids to run around. I heard there was a splash pad but never actually saw it. Looking forward to coming back for an actual game soon!

I can confidently say this will be my newest "go to" spot in the neighborhood. Prior to actually eating here, I had visited Grassroots Kitchen & Tap for just drinks. The drinks were made well and the prices seemed fair. They have a pretty good selection of wines bottled & on tap. The beers average about $6 but you can get a pitcher for about $12. It's a great deal and even better if you go during happy hour. The bar has a great atmosphere and the bartenders are all very friendly. After a few fun experiences of just hanging out at the bar, I finally actual got a chance to eat here this weekend! It was AMAZING!   First we started with their soup of the day, Black Bean Sirloin Chili. We ordered a side of bread to go with it so we could all share it as an appetizer.. It was the perfect way to start our meal. Lots of flavor and they don't skimp on the sirloin portions. For dinner I had the Vegetable Platter, my husband had the Half Chicken, my mom had the BBQ Brisket, and my dad had the Short Ribs. The Vegetable platter was shockingly very filling and had tons of flavor. I was afraid I would miss eating meat for dinner, but I ended up not missing it at all. It was perfect! The kale had a great garlicky flavor and the tomatoes and blue cheese mix is now one of my favorite flavor combinations that I'm definitely going to try to mimic at home. I got to taste a bite of all the dishes my family ordered too had they were all great. The chicken was super moist and had a slight sweetness in flavor. The ribs & brisket were both tender and booming with flavor as well.   Where this restaurants loses a star is because of the sides. Aside from my vegetable platter, All the other side dishes were really lacking in flavor and added nothing the main course. The grits seemed a little mushy and didn't have the flavor your would expect from the Jalepeno. The orzo was just average too. In fact, everyone cleaned their plates of the meats but no one really touched their sides. They kept eating the kale and tomatoes off my plate. The next time I go, I might ask if I can get the kale with my main course instead of the grits or orzo.  Overall I loved it here. I can't wait for a chance to go back and so excited to have a new place in the neighbor I can stumble home from.

So I lucked out and won tickets to this through Local FIrst Az. I had no idea what it was but after looking at the website, my husband and I decided to get a babysitter and go. We really had no idea what to expect and honestly didn't have high hopes after trying to find parking and finding the area to get wrist bands. After getting our wristbands, we heard a latin band playing in the distance and headed there. It ended up being Sergio Mendoza y la orkestra. So fun! It was definitely a great start! We couldn't find a band list so we looked up the schedule online which was running extremely slow, If  you go next year I'd recommend printing a copy before you head out. My husband saw Pinback was playing so we headed to the City Scape stage which visually was set up so well! The stage was set up so all the taller buildings were in the background and you could see people watching the action from neighboring restaurants that overlooked the stage. It was the first time for me Downtown Phoenix actually felt like a big city downtown should feel. After hear a few sets from Pinback, we headed to the next venue and briefly heard a band at the Phoenix Alley stage. We next walked over the Hotel San Carlos and heard the best band of the night, The Pig Pen Theater Company. Such a great band that I had never heard of! That for me was the best part of the night, being able to just walk around and hear bands you probably would have never heard of otherwise. I loved it, and would definitely pay for tickets next year! Just a heads up, I heard them tell lots of people they we sold out! So get your tickets ahead of time.
