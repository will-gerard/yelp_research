Horrible place... I ordered 2 egg breakfast with bacon! The bacon that was served to me was rotten, smelly and slimy... I told the waiter and he asked if I wanted something different I said know I was grossed out and he apologized and gave me a 10% discount on bill.   Very disgusting and disappointed. Stay away or you'll get salmonella poisoning!! I wish I could give them negative stars!

If you want a picnic feeling it would definitely satisfy your interest, but like any picnic.... bugs, foliage, smells, dust and that's just what your food will be topped with once they bring it to your table. The food is average, nothing you can't order at your local chain dinner. It's something you might want to experience and try once but I'm not falling for the hype!  If you decide to go, dress comfortably, you're outdoors and it's Arizona.

The bar is just "okay" but definitely wouldn't recommend it to all woman group or for a hangout place, more of a quick pit stop type place or if your in the neighborhood... The staff are a bunch a woman and not very friendly at all (super snobby if you ask me)... for what that's worth, the food is okay not the best not the worst, beers about $4 other alcoholic beverages about $7.

Husband & I decided to try this out after going to the "Flavors of the West" Goodyear event. The seafood gumbo was watery but the flavor was okay, the jambalaya was a sticky dry mess on your plate and it came with a side salad that you can tell it was a grocery store bagged salad not fresh at all! At the end we were hoping for at least something to take the bad taste in your mouth and we ordered dessert, big mistake! The "Banana pudding" was boxed pudding.... the beignets were dense and had more powder sugar on them that if you exhaled while you took a bite it would go flying everywhere. I wouldn't recommend this food and you really don't even want to get me started on the ambiance... Seriously! Try it at your own risk!!!!

Great dogs, it's always clean but it can get packed during the lunch hour crowd and it's a very small place so plan accordingly.

I loved this place. It has a nice ambiance, the food is amazing and it's perfect for an intimate get together. It's family own and family operated so the service is a little slow but is well worth it.

Stopped here with my 2 teens and they loved it. Great way to cool of and the ice cream is superb. Wish they had more indoor seating though but it was still nice.

Decided to try this tonight with my daughter... I have to say, it's the lamest haunted house I've ever been in. The sets where cool really detailed, like a movie set and that's why they get 1 star. Everything else was LAME.   My 15 year old didn't even flinch once. I asked her how she had liked it afterwards and she said "The one at Sea World was more scary"  Their only form of scaring you is to scream in your ear... This zombie guy screamed in my ear so loud, my ear was still hurting afterwards, when I said "really dude" he followed behind me out of the room screaming "Yes Really!" every 3 seconds, Felt like punching him....   If you decide to go I recommend to bring earplugs and low expectations but in reality.... It's a big waste of time and money!!  Just pass and rent a scary movie at home you'll have a better chance at being scared then.

First time here... The food was good, I really enjoyed the Spicy Fried Rice I got a 3 to start but is think next time I'm going with a 4. Everyone was very kind and friendly. I would recommend you arrive early or do take out, the sitting is limited.

First time here... The wine was awesome! The staff is really nice, knowledgeable and attentive. They have a list of selected wines on happy hour (4-6 pm). Is definitely worth the try...
