Started coming here about a year ago for the saturday all you can eat days. For the price it can't be beat. I have been here at least 15 times now and the fish is almost always fresh and good, a few times i have had a bad piece but even the best places I have been get a bad one once in awhile. The selection isn't the largest on the all you can eat but the basics are all covered with tuna, yellowtail, unagi, las vegas rolls, spicy tuna, philly, boston, alaska and spicy yellowtail all being on the list. The dessert they have the mojos are of a kind and different all the tie but never a disappointment if you have room after all the sushi.  They also have a full bar and often feature different specialty brews here as well. You can also add a sake bomber to your all you can eat for i think $4 so not a bad deal.  The gripes here is that the service is not the best as the waitresses know that they add 20% tip to all of the all you can eat bills s they don't seem to try to hard. it can take awhile to get a drink refilled (unless its alcohol and an extra charge). The other thing is that it can take awhile for the sushi to get done. I have no problem with this most days as for the amount of food I and my friends orders it takes awhile to make but on occasion it can be excessive.  Despite the fact that there are other all you can eats closer to me I willingly drive the 20-30min to come here on Saturdays. For $17 this is a great deal and a good place to eat.  P.S. if you ride a motorcycle they have helmet/jacket hooks inside and allow parking on the side walk as the owner is a rider.

This review will brief as you only need to know 3 things about this place:  1. The Italian Sub is fantastic. 2. The meatball sub is fantastic. 3. The people are friendly and this is a great little mom & pop place.   That's it. Now go get some good food.

Cheap, on time and looks good.  I dropped the saddle bag rails for my bike off here to get switched from chrome to a matte black and was shocked that the price was about half of what I expected for them to prep and coat the rails.  Almost exactly on schedule at the end of the 12th business day after I dropped my parts off I was told they were ready to go.  Looking clean and ready to install these bad boys already are getting compliments from those who have seen them.

Sakana is not gonna amaze you with fancy rolls or the freshest fish in the world but they combine some solid combos with a great price and solid service.  I come to Sakana on a semi-regular basis for lunch because it is rare that you can find a $10-12 sushi lunch that won't leave you disgusted or with stomach problems later. Sakana has the wonderful Sakana lunch which is $10 comes with miso soup, small salad, a crunchy california roll thing, like 6 different nigiri pieces, and a spicy crab jalepeno popper thing. Yeah you read that right all of that for $10 at lunch time. I am a hungry dude and it's rare that i can finish all that food because there is so much. They also have a very good sashimi lunch special that is miso soup, 4 pieces of 4 different fishes, bowl of rice all for $11 and again very good.   The fish quality while not gonna make you mistake it for fresh catch or the best california or Seattle sushi joints is still fresh and tastes like it should and not like its been sitting for days or gonna be confused with the stuff sitting for hours on end at Fry's. I actually think it's pretty good and they do a good job at switching up what is in the lunch specials for what is in season and fresh so you do get good stuff and not just plain stuff as they mix in stuff like blue fin tuna or toro belly. I like the sashimi because usually it is Tuna, Salmon and 2 other fresh catches that rotate.  Also try the scallop dinamite as it is pretty good for cheap at lunch.  Like i said though don't expect to be wowed as it won't happen but you want a good lunch for cheap this place is as solid as you can get.

It's about time i got this review posted considering I have been eating lunch here at least once a week since I was told how close to work this was.  The food here is really good and fresh. I am a huge fan of middle eastern cuisine and I was surprised they had one of my favorites, kafta, on the menu. The kofta here is great it gets a nice light char from the grill on the outside but is still juicy and tender on the inside. I love it. The fact that the platter is only $8 and comes with rice, hummus and salad is a deal I can't pass up.  Those who know me know that I am picky on what hummus I enjoy since i have been making my own for almost 20 years. The hummus here is the rare exception to my normal rule that I don't like the super smooth and creamy hummus. I am not sure what exactly it is but I like it here.  For lunch I usually get the tabouli instead of the salad as my second side. It's really fresh and has a nice bite to it. I usually mix it with some hummus and apply to pita bread as the flavors work well together.  As for other things on the menu I have sampled most of their range of baklava thanks to the great yelp check in deal they had. I really liked the walnut but usually I will just look into the case and point at whatever looks good. That plan hasn't left me disappointed yet so I think I will stick with it. For entree's the chicken shwarma is my second favorite, the garlic sauce really makes this dish; the beef shawarma is pretty tasty but I have a hard time passing over the chicken for this one.  The staff is friendly and I can't find a negative thing to say about this place. Check it out and you will be happy you did.

the only reason to come here is for the $19.99 all you can eat deal. It does have the widest selection of sushi on the AYCE menu but most of it is average to below average. The unagi here is downright inedible to the point that it makes you sick the second you taste. Its so bad that my friends and I avoid rolls with it.  There rolls are ok but mostly bland (so is a lot of the nigiri) the wasabi roll and 911 rolls definitely bring some heat but are still edible and they are ok. The albacore nigiri however is melt in your mouth and for $20 i could almost justify consuming about 15 orders of it as a meal (i had 6.5 the other night even with 2 other rolls).  The one issue though is something did upset my stomach and my girlfriends but i have been here 3 other times with no issue.  If your looking for a lot of sushi cheap come here but if you want quality this isn't the place to be. Moto's AYCE on saturday's is less expansive of a menu but the fish quality is light years better.

As Jesse J. said we went here last night for some sushi after i had looked here on Yelp and man was it worth it. So far this is probably the best sushi I have had in Arizona.  My favorite roll was the big and spicy roll. The flavor was just amazing with the seared salmon and yellowtail(?) on top with the pickled jaleneno. The sauce on it was amazing as well this is one where no soy sauce is needed.  Also ordered a spicy tuna but asked him to go a little on the spicy side and he obliged and it was a nice fiery roll but not so much that the taste of the tuna got lost. It but some burning on my tounge but was amazing.  The rest of the meal was jut as good especially the tsunami roll which I can best describe as a vegas roll minus the cream cheese(i am no a fan of cream cheese in sushi) with it's own special sauce. The sauce was a great mix of hot and sweet where you got a bit of a kick but it was cooled quickly. Even people who don't do spice will like this.  The only things preventing this from being a 5 star place was that i never got the water i ordered and some of my miso soup was cold, i think the tofu had not been in long enough. A return visit is planned soon and could easily up this to 5 stars.

My mom came to town to help me out with surgery and on her last night we wanted to go out somewhere for a good dinner to celebrate me feeling better. After a bit of thinking i remember this place. We came here durring happy hour which was great as they have some great prices especially for the quality.  The nigiri here is phenomenal we had both Escolar and Albacore both of which were amazing. Surprisingly the escolar was cooked (with hand held torch) but had amazing flavor and great texture (and i am not a big fan of cooked sushi).  We also had the Crazy roll (half off for happy hour), the big and spicy roll (still great), a negi-yellowtail (not chopped up like most places just shashimi cuts with scallion and wrapped), and i had a spicy tuna hand roll. All of it was great and the fish quality top notch.  We also had the house cold sake (too sweet for my taste but not bad).  The only downsides were the miso was again a bit cold (the tofu is not soaked in the the soup but tossed in cold). And also there was an odd smell that i am pretty sure is from the fish joint next door but not from here.  For the 2 of us with the sake it was $50 and worth it all. As for price it is about the same i expect for a dinner from Ra, Kona, Sakana, ect but the quality of fish is so much higher and the taste is way better.  Have to say Shimogamo is rapidly becoming my favorite sushi place in the valley

Stopped here on the way to the Ren. Festival and I can't wait to go back. While their I had the green chili burrito which was fantastic along with a brat that was very tasty as well. I also took some of the Sun Devil sticks and green chili brats home with me. The sticks are coated in crushed red pepper but have enough flavor that it doesn't taste like pure fire. The flavor of the meat and spices comes through nicely. The brats i cooked up with some onions and a bit of beer and were fantastic. Good snap, great flavors from the chunks of chilies that were in it. I wish I had got some bacon though as my friends did and they kept raving about it.   Only knocks on the place is that it is so far out and the prices are a bit on the higher side but still worth it in general. I am already working on an excuse to get back out that way so I can try some chops and bacon.

Had never even heard of a bialy before I went here but it was really good. Got a tomato basil bialy with cream cheese and lox. It was really good and a nice filling meal. Probably ate too much but I wanted to finish it was so good.   The bialy is supposed to be healthier than a bagel which is great because i think it tastes better too. The tomato basil packed a ton of flavor. Can't wait till i get back here again.

Why is it so hard to find a good bagel and lox these days? I really wanted a good small non-chain bagel place to go to (read: not Einstein's) to go to with some good bagels and quality lox to have. I had high hopes for this place that would take me back to when I would get bagels with my grandpa back in Boston but this place failed. I have tried twice now hoping that maybe it was just the bagel i got or the day I went but same result over priced for mediocre quality. The bagels didn't have much flavor and were over toasted, the lox was bland and way to slimy and seemed like it was the cheap stuff from Costco (not even there good stuff).  The only good thing was that the creamy cheese was well flavored and the tomatoes seemed fresh. For a near $10 price tag though I was very underwhelmed and actually preferred the bagels and lox at Einstien's. I guess I will keep trying in my search.

My home away from home (too bad i can see it from my home and decide i need a vacation a bit too often). When it comes to a dive bar or UFC watching location this is my spot. I may come here a bit often considering one of the serves knows me, my group of friends, our regular drinks, our preferred seating for UFC and is willing to trade friendly insults back and forth.   The selection of beer has everything i need: Blue Moon and Kiltlifter on tap. The bar also has jager and redbull. At this point I don't need much additional info but you might so they do have the full compliment of other tap beer and some bottles that you would expect and is needed for a good night.  The feature pool tables, mini hoops, hunting video games, a jukebox and I think they still have the ping pong. For UFC good viewing seats are limited but i have found no reason not to show up 2-3 hours early start eating and drinking and avoid cover while getting the best seat in the house but that is me.  As for food they aren't the best bar food in town(see: baseline sportsbar) but they aren't going to make you regret ordering something with the expectation this is still a bar. I happen to like the sliders, guacamole, and chicken tenders.   Price is reasonable with different specials everyday but overall not bad.  It's 5 o'clock somewhere so head on over and grab a drink

I don't have much to say about dry cleaning but I use these guys a lot. They are quick, not to expensive and have been able to get out some stains for me and add on some buttons.  The fact that they have a drive thru is very convenient.   I am probably not an expert on the subject but for me they get the job done.

The service here is amazing. I got a flat over the weekend and called every open tire center around trying to see who would inspect the tire under the manufacture warrenty. Nobody (sears,costco, wal mart,ect) would look at it since they didn't sell it. I called discount as soon as they open and the guy said come on in we will handle it. Even though the tire had obvious curb damage that would void the warrenty they still worked with me to give me 50% off the new tire (a $120 savings). They didn't have the tire in stock but took my tire and rim and said by 3 it would be all set to put it on the car. I came back at 5:40 just before close and they put it on and i was done by 6:15.  The service here was hands down the best i have ever had at a tire dealer and I would recommend anybody to come here. The original price of the tire was also cheaper than tirerack.com pre-shipping so even full price they would have had the best deal in town and the only ones with the tire in stock

I hate going to the MVD so when I need to change over my title to Arizona I took a friends suggestion and went third party for it.  Wow what a time saver that was. Not only was I able to go on a Saturday when all the MVD locations are closed but I was in and out in under 20 minutes.  To top that off the people working there were pleasant, helpful and efficient. The only draw back to the whole thing was the extra $25 conveniance fee all the third party locations charge. In the grand scheme of things though that $25 is money well spent for better, quicker and convenient serivce.  I highly recommend going here if you need to do any MVD related activities outside of getting a liscense.

What a cool little spot that I didn't even realize was a spot until last week. I used to just think of it as the plaza by the Science Center but now I know it as much more.  I was here twice on back to back days and realized the beauty of this place. First I was here for a lunch time visit to Pizzeria Bianco and then relaxed for a bit in the square and just enjoyed the weather.   The next night I was back to enjoy the Phoenix Brewers Invitational beer fest where the square was packed with vendors and music and made for a great setting for a beer fest. Everything was close and going one end to the other seemed full of stuff but not a long walk either.  With events like the beer fest and daily joys like the Science Center, Bianco and Nobuo this is a great little spot.

Hungover? Check.  Hungy? Check.  Downtown? Check  Means one thing I need something filling and greasy and the best plan was Lo-Lo's for me and my friends. Waking up on a Sunday morning and needing food we quickly decided that chicken and waffles was the only correct choice.  I ordered a arnold palmer with sweet tea and my friends got grape and red koolaid. All the drinks were great and served in some pretty large mason jars. The Arnold palmer with it's mix of sweet flavors and bitter bite of lemon was a great way to wake up and get some fluids of the non-alcoholic kind.  For food I got the Baby Ray's which is chicken covered in gravy and onions and some waffles. It was great the chicken was super moist inside and the flavors of the chicken, gravy and waffles make a savory bite that was as pleasing to the stomach as it was the tongue.  The gravy was just enough to cover the chicken but not so much it was too much. The waffles have a spice in them that i think is nutmeg but makes very flavorful on it's own without syrup.   The meal was exactly what i needed to get me up and back to normal...sadly it was so good I ate so much I needed a glorious food coma to recover. I can't wait till I can come back and try the other goodies like Mac and Cheese or cornbread. Even the fried fish sounds good.

So i had never had Dim Sum before being taken here as a birthday lunch with my buddy. My buddy happens to be a connoisseur of some weird dishes so I was apprehensive half the time he put something new down in front of my and told me to eat it. However only on one occasion was I disappointed (I am not a chicken feet fan). The food here was really tasty and flavorful.   I really liked the shark fin dumplings (named for the shape according to my buddy), the shrimp in noodles, and the sweet tofu at the end.  For a first experience at Dim Sum this was a good one and has me wanting to go back to try some more. The one thing I wished they had was something that made it a little easier for me to figure out what was in each dish, although this time it wouldn't have mattered much.

I am a huge fan of gyros and greek food and try all different places and this one is a great one. I ordered the Gyro/Fries./Drink combo and it was great. The gyro was over flowing with meat with just the right amount of veggies and lettuce. The tzatziki sauce was applied in the right amount to get every bite and was very good. The fries are wonderful as was said by another reviewer. They were nice and crispy outside but soft and cooked well inside, they are also thicker somewhere between a McDonalds fire and steak house steak fry. The only thing that keeps me from giving a full 5 star was some of my meat was a little dry. Overall I really like it and will come back for more.

Best margherita pizza I have found so far. The basil is great, tomatoes are ripe and wonderful and the crust is nice and thin. I can eat a medium by myself just because i like the taste so much. if you like pizza and capresse salads you will love this pizza Have to say for pizza it is better than oregano's and I like the atmosphere as you will often see Vito himself lending a hand.  I also like the cesar salad here as they give you anchovies on the side if you like and i happen to like anchovies on mine especially with a good quality sauce like they have here.  Oh the one time i had dessert here it was good too, don't remember what it was because it was a few months back but i remember it was a good end to the meal.  Can't speak on the rest of the menu but for pizza this place is a winner.

I have to start by saying this review is of my visit on this particular occasion not over it's history. This is one of my favorite places to eat in Arizona and I recommend it to everybody i know. I even brought my grandparents about a week back for a great meal. However my meal on valentines day was sub-par especially for this restaurant.   As i said this is one of my favorite places and my girlfriends favorite as well as the site of one of our first dates so we figured it was the perfect spot for valentines day. We were wrong. The issues started out early on when I called for reservations and asked for what was available(this was 11am the day of as we had originally planned to be out of town) and was told 8:45pm was the earliest. I took the reservation. My girlfriend decided to check Open Table and found a bunch of tables available before then. We got one scheduled for 7:15 and i canceled mine.   We arrived and it was not busy at all. Nobody standing in the lobby like normal and no wait. A couple even walked in ahead of us and was seated immediately without even being asked if they had a reservation. We were seated promptly as well. Once seat things went ok the usual chopped liver and bread came out which was good as always. Then we ordered our meals along with the Shrimp De Jogon that my girlfriend likes and wanted me to try. It took forever to come out and we only got it once our waitress looked over and saw it was not there and said let me check. She came back with it and warned that it was very hot. Which it was but sadly i think that meant it had been under the heat lamps for too long as the shrimp had become way over cooked and chewy. It was to the point the tails were hard to remove and my girlfriend even commented that there was very little sauce and what was there had dried around the shrimp. It was a $10 app that i wish I never ordered.  next came our steaks. We both had the filet mine was the bigger of the two both cooked medium-rare (or at least ordered as such). Hers came out more to the rare side but not horribly and mine came out way too medium with hardly any pink in the center. The outside of mine was more charred than they normally do and the taste of the char over powered what is normally a well flavored steak. At this point we had decided to skip desert and call it a night as we had been disappointed enough.  Having had a wonderful meal here less than 2 weeks before this one I really hope this was a fluke but it was a very disappointing night. I am hoping a return visit in the future will make me feel better about what is normally a 4.5 star place in my book.

Ok so I must have been in a bad mood when I wrote my previous review because this place is one of my favorites. It's where my sister and I decided to have our Grad party and were met with zero hesitation from my parents.  I love this place the atmosphere is fantastic with all the sports collectibles, it doesn't happen to be terribly loud for dinner unlike a lot of places. Let's not forget they start you out with some of the best chopped liver I have ever had.  My favorite here is the prime rib as it is always perfectly cooked and seasoned and nice and juicy. I am also a big fan of the cesar salad here, for some reason it is better than most.  Oh and found out the steak sandwich is really a medium steak served with 2 pieces of bread on the side. My buddy ordered it at my grad party and we both expected some slices of steak between some bread. What he got was a full steak and 2 pieces of garlic break.   I have no idea what made me post the last review and not throw out the one random night they were a bit off on a busy holiday. This is on of my favorites in the valley and my first choice when I want a steak. Been here tons of times and hope to go back tons more.

As far as an allergist and ENT goes Dr. Cohen and staff can not be beat for service, quality of care and patient satisfaction. They are very accommodating to your schedule, rarely running late, often can get you in the same day and show a true care in your health.  I have been going to Dr. Cohen for over a year now. Initially it was for a check up about mild sleep apnea and seeing if my tonsils played a roll in that. After a through check up and examining me Dr. Cohen presented the option of a tonsillectomy and uvula trimming to help open my passage ways. I was not pressured into this decision and was clear told it was not a must procedure but it would improve my quality of life. So i elected to have the procedure done. Dr. Cohen and staff prepared me well and we very supportive getting me all the info i needed and clear explaining what to expect. While the procedure hurt like crazy like they warned me it would, and so did anybody who had tonsils out as an adult, I was always updated on my progress, seen within hours if i had a problem big or small, and had all my needs met. Just as i was told the healing took awhile but I have been so much better with better sleep and fewer sore throats since.  When it came time to deal with my allergies they did a great job in treating it and getting me set up with weekly shots to help with my problems.  When I realized i was having a lot of sinus trouble and breathing through my nose (now that my throat was clear i noticed this much more) the dr looked and tried a few different things like shots to help inflammation and suction to clear the pathways. When that failed he told me a deviated septum correction and some sinus work would help. The surgery was quick, easy and very minimal pain...I went to the movies the next day and was on very minimal pain killers for 3-4 days.  I can't say enough good things about all the staff here they are great and I can't be happier with my experience and results.   P.s. If they ask if you want to see Sean the Nurse Practitioner don't hesitate he does all the doctor does except surgery, can write scripts and is a great guy to see.

Another great spot to get beers in the valley? Yep it's true Papago joins the list with 4 peaks, San Tan and Lost Leaf as great places to get a beer. They have several of their own microbrews on tap along with a changing selection of other craft beers. Add to that a QT sized bank of fridges filled with all kinds of bottles or great stuff from around the world and you have an all in one stop for the beer connoisseur.   I have been here twice now and it's a good place to come have a few beers. The service is good and friendly and prices are very reasonable (around 5-7 per beer). I went on a friday night and it was a bit packed but people are willing to share tables. Haven't tried any food here yet so holding off the 5th star until I can vouch for the food.   On a personal beer selection note they carry one of my favorites from my time in Germany the Franziskaner Dunkle-Weis. I highly recommend it to any hefe fan who wants a little something different.

I was raised to be skeptic of all used car dealers, mechanics and auto body guys but this place met and exceeded my expectations. I came in on a saturday to get an estimate, and figure out a rough time table to get the mangled rear quater pannel and bumper of my car fixed. I was told roughly 2.5 weeks but they won't make promises because if they see a quality issue or anything unseen they don't want to rush (i figured this was a prelude to an almost certain delay. I dropped my car off on the following monday and was offered a ride home and had arranged one but i was able to get my gf to take me.  Ron helped me through the paperwork answered all my questions about how the paint would be matched (it was a blue with flake from factory which is hard to match). He told me again the time table but wouldn't rush quality if something came up.  He called me the following day to let me know the damage was a bit more extensive once he took things apart but thought the time table would still be ok. I recieved another call about a week later and he said things were going smooth and the car was going to paint in a few days (right on the time table if not a bit early).  I called him the following week to ask if the car would be ready on Wednesday (the earliest day he had said it could be done). He said he would check and after a bit of confusion he said yep and i was able to pick it up.  All the paperwork was simple as a few signatures and they handled everything else with my insurance i just had to pay the deductible to the.  As for the body work it was amazing you can't even tell the car was damaged or repainted at all unless you look really hard (i.e. some signs of repainting/welding on the seem on the trunk ledge (not a common spot to be looking at unless your trying). The paint (my concern) was flawless and matched the rest of the car perfectly. The car was returned cleaned (even my dirty rims and tired were cleaned up).  The price was reasonable too from what i can tell, just over $3k to replace a rear quater, correct rear bumper and inner fender well, and to paint the car. I know the other car involved with my accident was 2k at another shop just to fix a dent and paint 2 doors.  Top notch service here and a state farm preferred body shop. I recommend them to anybody.

Oh four peaks you have done it again you sneaky devil. Some how when I think they have come up with the best daily specials ever they come and blow it away and today raised the bar to new heights. I walked in sat down read the menu and was torn between two amazing specials that made me drool just reading the words. They had a burger with a fried egg and hollandais sauce on it and an amazing sounding seared blue fin ahi blt with siracha aoli.   Honestly I could go on and on about this meal as it still makes my mouth water 2 weeks later just thinking about it. The ahi blt was by far and away the star and may be one of the best pieces of ahi I have had in years especially on sandwich style preparation. The burger on any other day would be a menu champ but came up just a tad short.   My only regret is not going back to have another blt for dinner since I don't know when or if it will come around again.

Wow this place has gone down hill big time. Used to be that the sushi was ok for a quick sushi fix but now it is barely passable as sushi not nasty old fish. I came in and ordered the sushi combo (6 assorted nigiri and a Cali roll) I asked to switch to a spicy tuna not the Cali roll and was told there was an upcharge on the already $16 combo but whatever it's what I wanted and all the good specialty rolls were over priced. Also most places charge for changing combos and it was only $1 so nothing to hefty. The charge did include miso soup and a small salad. It was all bad.   The miso soup was way to grainy even when well stirred. The salad was bland except for the taste of bad tomato. The spicy tuna didn't taste anywhere near fresh or right. All the nigiri was just off on taste especially the eel which tasted like dirty water from a hose. And the salmon which was just bad. Another piece was chewy and hard to get down. Even the shrimp piece tasted old.   I will never come back here again. What used to be a close to campus option has sadly been beat out in taste and price by the sushi to go place in the Memorial Union on campus.   Save yourself some money an bad taste and go to cafe wasabi, sake bomber or ra if you need sushi around here.

Need drunk food on mill? Look no further than silvermine. They stay open late to feed that post boozing hunger and they have good subs to boot. I got a sub with roast beef turkey and cheese and it was just what I needed. My buddy got some of the broccoli cheese soup which was surprisingly good and I am not even a fan of broccoli cheese soup normally.   Only real knock on this place is that it tends to be a bit pricy when compared to other similar sandwich places

Calling all stoners, Calling all stoners. Well ok not just stoners because the food here is awesome for those of us who aren't stoners too.  The menu names will make you feel like you are breaking the law just by ordering a La Canna Blunt or a Kush piner but the only thing illegal about these is how good these "toasted" subs taste. No matter what your mental state when you get one of these you will chow them down like you haven't eaten in day.  My personal favorite is the aforementioned La Canna fileld with your usual selection of italian meats and olives, throw on some of there pickles and you have a tasty snack to munch on.   Don't forget to order one of their special brownies filled with all kinds of chocolatey fudgey goodness when you get the dessert munchies.

Now on my third time eating here since I found it a few weeks back and everything is amazing. I a big fan of homemade middle eastern food an have been spoiled with it because family and friends would make it (my grandpa made hummus, tabouli and falafel). this place does it right. I have tried the gyro, kifta, hummus, tabouli and more and it has all been great.   My true judge of a mid-eastern place is the hummus since I love it and have been making my own for as long as I can remember. This stuff is great right combo of flavors and good bread to boot. My only knock is it's a but creamier than I like and a bit less garlic(but I love super extra garlic so I can't hold that against them). Overall it's just right and I will devour it.   The meats are all flavorful and moist (especially rare with most other gyros). The tabouli is a nice mix of greens and wheat with a ton of fresh flavors.  Plain in simple if you like mid-eastern food go here you won't regret it. Try the combination meal and get a bit of all the good stuff.

Used to think this place was good but now that i have expanded my horizons I have come to realize it is not. I came back recently on my lunch break because this is close to campus and felt like a good idea on a cold day. I was disappointed after having been spoiled with the great pho other places. Got my standard which is a pho with rare beef. The beef was not rare nor was it plentiful in the bowl as i have come to expect other places. The broth seemed to lack flavor and the basil I was given just didn't look good along with the lime.   Another knock is that they have a $10 minimum charge for a credit or debit card but a bowl of soup is $6 (pretty standard price so no gripe there) so you almost have to get an app and soup or bring a friend. Even a drink brings you just shy which means have cash which I rarely have.  With unPhogettable, Khai Hoan, Pho ao sen and others in the area this should be left as a strictly a choice for convince sake and not on taste.

It's finding places like this that remind me why it is great to be a yelper. I was looking for something different to do for lunch than my usual spots so I hopped on here and found Munch A Mania and I am very glad I did. This little hole in a wall, or in this case industrial strip mall, is one of those hidden gems that you need to be connected to find out about.  The location itself is unassuming but the food is anything but. I walked in with no idea what I wanted and it got even harder to choose once i saw the menu where everything looked great and inexpensive as well. In the end I went with a meatball sub combo, I think the total was $7 less than I spend at subway for a foot-long. i was also impressed by the use of an iPad & Square to pay, as a tech nerd I always enjoy seeing that kind of thing get used, also shows me that the owners are willing to think outside the box.  The sub was good as the bread seemed fresh, the meatballs were well sized and full of meat and not too much bread/filler. The meatballs and sauce were actually flavorful which is more than I can say for subway. Also the sub with a bag of chips was just about the perfect sized lunch, i was full but not overly so. Definitely enough of a pleaser to convince me to come back and try some of the other subs i passed on for the meatball.  I am holding off the extra star until I can get back and try a more standard cold cut sub but I am doubting it will be long before I stop by again. If you want to try something different for lunch I say come check this out as it is a welcome change to the standard chain sub shops that are a dime a dozen in Tempe.

Today I went here with my girlfriend for a couple appetizers and a glass of wine as a mid-afternoon bite to eat after hearing good things. We are normally at D'vine in mesa for this type of thing but noticed cafe boa had opened up out next to D'vine and had been meaning to try it and being that we were in Tempe we figured trying the sister location here.   We had the bruschetta which is normally a favorite of ours was over powered by far to many capers and to a lesser extent olives. The taste of basil is completely lost as is the balsamic vinegar. Not something we would recommend or order again.  Also got the shrimp adriatico which taste like plain shrimp as the sauce was too thin to coat the shrimp. When bread was dipped in the sauce it was good but nothing special more like your average tomato bisque taste. It did later however later cause my stomach to be very upset so i have some concern here.  Also had a glass of a california red wine that was fairly inexpensive and was just bland but not horrible.  The overall verdict was this was not a place we would return and we would rather make the drive to D'vine for the wine and bruschetta and apps there.

Wow i am blown away and amazing upset at the same time. Why am I so upset? Because I have lived literally next door to this place for 3+ years and have never been or even heard somebody mention it. Thank god for yelp though as I have found this beauty now.  From the first bite to the last I was in heaven. A buddy and I started of with the basket of bread which comes with a tomato sauce. What the menu fails to mention may be the greatest part of this simple app and that is the addition of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the top of the sauce which takes this to another level. I am not gonna lie but something may have moved in my pants on the first bite of this one. The sauce and bread are that good. the only problem was that there was not enough bread for all the sauce...but maybe that wasn't a problem.  We also ordered the Prosciutto which also features fresh basil and mozzarella. The pizza did not fail to disappoint as it was a great blend of flavor on it it's own. But loving the sauce from the app as much as we did we applied a little extra drizzle on for a great dish. Also by pure accident some left over olive oil we had on our plates also enhanced the flavor as well (the oil they have on table is very good). A tip is to put a few drops on your plate and spread it before laying a slice down. I do have to say the crust wasn't super crisp but was still one of the best i have had in my life.  I was disappointed to learn the only dessert was tiramisu as I am not a fan but not a deal breaker.  The total was a very reasonable $33 for the pizza, app, and 2 drinks. I can't wait to go back.

Ok let's get this clear now yes I went back to this place less than 24 hours after my first visit. Yes I do have a problem and No I don't plan on seeking help.  Anyway my friends who read my review and heard me talk about how good this place was friday night decided to go on saturday night...how could i not go? The 3 of us split the 4 season pizza and an Eggplant Parm pizza. Once again they were amazing. The 4 seasons was the star with the prosciutto  cheese and sauce covering the entire pizza and then 2 slices each covered with: tomato, olive, artichoke hearts or mushroom. The veggies were some of the freshest and most delicious I have had (i want to know where they get their tomatoes from). They also don't skimp on the toppings either as each slice had a full layer or two of the veggies especially the mushroom and artichoke. The eggplant was also amazing as the flavors worked just right and the eggplant was crispy yet not over cooked. My minor complaint of soft crust from my last review had vanished as both had perfectly crispy crusts.  They also have some very good beers from Russia and Croatia they we enjoyed. Which led to some good conversation with our waitress who was very beer knowledgeable. This also led to a funny exchange where my friends said it was their first time there and i confessed i was back a second night in a row. She said she recognized me and asked if I was Jared...leading me to momentary panic as to why my name was already known and not sure what i did wrong (it's a reflex). Then she thanked me for my yelp review and i was able to breath a sigh of relief.  The waitress accidentally opened 2 beers on the second round thinking both my friends had ordered ones but they didn't and before she got to the table she realized this but gave us the second one free. Also as a thank you for my yelp review, which they had read less than 24 hours after being posted and everybody knew about it, we were giving 3 complimentary shots of Grapa form the owner. A very nice gesture.   Once again amazing place is fantastic and left my friends and I all raving how good it was and wanting more...we will probably be back this week.

I continue to be amazed by this place. You can read my other reviews and Jesse J.'s for an in depth breakdown but i needed to add an update. The reason i needed to update was that I have now been 5 times in the last week and a half and its always as good and the service is amazing.  I am a huge fan of places that make you feel like they appreciate your business well here they go above and beyond. I am now known by name to the staff and made to feel like its my home away from home. My friends and I keep coming back to try new pizzas and are never let down. The owner is a great guy who goes above and beyond and can be seen talking to everyone. For my friends and I he keeps giving us new shots to try and talk beer and liquor with us.   The way they make you feel like your at your local bar or a family dinner is great and is the icing on the cake to amazing food. If you haven't tried this place you are doing yourself a major disservice.

Decided to try the whole "New Domino's Pizza" last night and was surprised by how good it was. A million times better than the old. The crust actually was good and soft more like a wood fired pizza than typical delivery pizza, and had a very good taste to it. It has some seasoning on it reminding me of Hungry Howies garlic herb crust just not as strong. The toppings were good but nothing spectacular (i had pepperoni, olive, and onion) the peperoni wasn't as greasy as i remembered it so it was good. Sauce had a good garlic tomato taste and way better than the bland old stuff.  Now the most important part for a review like this for any college student: the second day taste test. I had my leftovers for breakfast and it heated up in the toaster very well. The crust didn't get hard it stayed soft and edible. The toppings held their flavor and it was a really good slice of leftover pizza.  Overall verdict is that Domino's has come a long way no longer is it  in with the Little Cesar's and Pizza Hut's of the world but up a step into the class with Papa John's and Hungry Howies out there. I still will take Hungry Howies ahead most days for price and taste but Domino's has done enough to earn my business on occasion.

Would be the best dive bar in tempe if Doc and Eddy's wasn't around (and walking/crawling distance from my place). Most nights baseline is pretty empty and a great place for a few drinks and laughs with friends without too many other people around. On fight night though get here at least 45min early as the place gets packed and even though they have tons of tv's the layout isn't the best for a huge crowd.  I have to say as far as bar food goes this place is up near the top with the chicken parm melt being something that I actually will have a craving for once in awhile. The only food that isn't up to par is the Queso as it is just nacho cheese with chopped tomato and jalepeno.   As for drinks I have never really had a problem with anything the one time my buddy and i did get one slightly weak we walked up to Eva the bartender and asked for it stiffer-MISTAKE- but in the best way possible as she loaded up the captain in our captain and cokes and did so till i had to ask her to stop so that I could get over my sea legs. Otherwise the drinks are decently priced(even rounds of shots and bombers) and well mixed.  On nights when it's time to just hang out in a more sedate bar and have a good conversation and maybe a bite to eat this is the place for me.

Sometimes you just feel like some old school Chinese food in little to go boxes. When I do I hit up chopstick express. The food is good is unassuming, services is quick and friendly, and the prices are fair.   I have eaten here several times over the years when I'm not doing the pei wei or panda thing and it's always met expectations. Just the other day I placed an order for a cup of hot and sour, Kung pao and some wantons. It was ready to go and after a coupon(they were nice enough to take a 3 day expired one) it totaled about 12-15 with tip  the exact number escapes me.  The Kung pao lacked some of the heat i was looking for but with some spicy mustard that was mostly resolved. The wontons were really good and i had to try not to eat them all at once. I was also surprised how much hot and sour soup you got in a small order (enough for two decent portions).  Once again if you want decent Chinese with friendlyy service and a good price this is the way to go,

I love some good Hawaiian BBQ and this place fits the bill. I called to order take out on my lunch break and sure enough by the time I got there my food was waiting and was nice and hot, which seems like a tall order for most take out. It was even still hot after the 10 minute drive back to work.  As for the food the flavors were great and I was devouring it like a mad man. Usually I am not a huge fan of the macaroni salad anywhere but I liked this and wished there was more of it (it was a solid ice cream scoop+ worth). The meat on the combo plate I got was all well cooked and still moist and tender not dried out.  They even gave enough food that I had some leftover that was enough for a small meal or a hearty snack. For the price it is a meal well worth it.

I've been to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich and had a stein and a some schnitzel in the Deutschland so I think I have a pretty good standard to compare this too and sadly it's not even close.  I get that this is a Vegas themed resturant but they should try to come at least close to the original. The jager scnitzel I had was bland and chewy and at $20 should have been way more flavorful than it was considering it was a small piece of meat with a tiny portion of spatzle. The spatzle wasn't bad and was pretty close to what I had in Germany but had the taste like it was made a few days ago and not fresh.  The real negative part of this is that we had a group of 16 and even though we had a reservation got slammed into a table that had a bunch of dudes on a bachelor party snuggled up way too close.  The worst part was at the end somehow with an average price of about $30 per person spent on food and drink (pre-tax and tip) we all ended up needing to throw in $60 each to make it work after tax and tip (they wouldn't split the tab). Seems like we got over charged but with a group that size it was hard to determine how that happened.  I will say the music was fun and the decor was right on point so it does have the german vibe going for it.

After reading the glowing reviews here on yelp my gf and i tried this place out this morning. The result was not what we were hoping for.  I was deciding between a couple things for breakfast and when i asked the waitress for a recommendation she didn't hesitate to say the Eggs Benedict, which is a favorite of mine so I ordered it. My gf ordered the blueberry griddle cake (read:over sized pancake). I also got a jumbo OJ and she got a rasberry chocolate latte that was a special for the day.  Had we only ordered drinks this place would have been 4 star. The OJ was nice and fresh with great taste and the latte was very good with not too sweet a rasberry taste and better than anything at starbucks for less money.  Then the food came and things went downhill. My eggs were prepared fine but somebody forgot to add any flavor beyond the smoked flavor in the ham. The hollandaise was bland, the eggs were nothing special, the standout was the potatoes but even they weren't much beyond you average ihop country potatoes. I added pepper and tobacco after the first few bites but it didn't help give any real flavor.  Sharon said the pancakes were bland as well and lacking flavor as well and only ate half based on how much there was and how she got tired of them after awhile.  The price wasn't bad and the service was only fair. It cost $30 after tip for all the food so not bad about the same as ihop but flavor didn't make it worth it. The service was fine with the exception that we called for a reservation based on some recommendations and we arrived they didn't have us on the list but we were still seated promptly. The server was helpful and promot and it was a nice touch the way they were all dressed in chino shorts and button up shirts, felt like a nice east coast yacht club.

I really like this crazy mashup of a place. When I first heard of crossing Chinese food and Mexican I was a bit skeptical. In end the food actually comes out really good I'm huge fan of machaca and the red Jade chicken both of which a flavor packed, I had the spicy diablo chicken the other day which has heat and flavor.   It's fun to try different mashups with burritos and quesadilla's and the different ingredients. So far I think the Diablo Chicken and Machaca in a quesadilla are the best and a red jade burrito is the way to go. You can always ask to try something before you order and the staff is happy to help you figure all the choices out.  I always get the black beans and jerk fried chicken since those are amazing the rice is probably the most flavorful rice I have had.  The combo deal is a great value too as it is a lot of food for a single sitting but works well for a meal and a snack especially if you do what i do and get 1 entree plain and the other in a burrito or quesadilla. Plus they give you a good cinnamon sugar cookie with everything.  This location is also much bigger than the phoenix one and seems like you get in and out faster but it is hard to find. If you are there and looking for it it's tucked back behind some trees sort of hidden from the rest of the shopping center.  If you like mexican and Chinese or trying sort of off the wall mixing of the two this place is for you.

I have to second Jesse J's comment about this place and add another Woooooooow to the list.  Been here twice now and each time i have left full, delighted and taste bud happy. My favorite things on the menu are probably the appetizers with the millionaire lobster tacos and mixto cerviche being melt in your mouth good. The shrimp chicharron have a nice little kick to them that is offset nicely with the endive.  On my most recent trip I got a main course of the mahi mahi with calamari. It was fantastic. I wish I could describe all the flavor combinations but there was just such a rich blend I couldn't even begin to do it justice. The fish was perfectly cooked and I was a happy camper.  For sides I highly recommend the arroz tostado en cazuela with the crab and asparagus making a great and tasty rice dish. There is plenty to share so it says for 2 people but if you have a few people and another side there will be plenty since entre portions are generous.  The dessert is the best part with the white chocolate cigar (dusted in coco powder to look like a cigar) and expresso gelato being one of the best desserts I have had at a restaurant. What was really cool was since I was there celebrating my graduation and the waiter knew he told the chefs in the back. They decorated a piece of chocolate garnish with congrats on it (I will add the photo).  Top this all off with a quiet and nice setting in the basement of the Westin and you have a winner. Seeing the artist paint live in the entry hallway is a cool little extra.  it may seem odd to have dinner in a hotel basement but it is well worth it.

Been here a few times now and while I have never been overly impressed I have always been satisfied. Came recently with my family for breakfast/brunch and got the eggs benedict (my favorite breakfast). The eggs came out perfectly cooked with just the right amount of hollandaise sauce. The flavors were good if not spectacular. I did really enjoy the potatoes as they were a bit more flavorful then normal breakfast potatoes.   I also had a bloody mary (little hair of the dog from the previous night). It was not as spicy as i liked but well flavored and had plenty of vodka to do the trick.  If you are looking for something in the area stop by and try it out. Like I said you won't be blown away but odds are you won't be let down either. Also sit on the patio if you can it's pretty nice out there.

probably the best bang for your lunch buck in Tempe. For i think $7.95 you get a half sandwich (still big) a soup in a bread bowl and a bag of chips. If you aren't full after eating all that i doubt there is any place where your going to be full for lunch without spending a small fortune.  I love the clam chowder here but the potato bacon is also really good. I have had a bunch of different sandwiches here and never found one I didn't like. I love the combinations they come up with here like the beef and Brie or the C.A.B. They have a ton of different combos and use cheeses you don't find many other places like Gouda or the Brie. Another huge plus is that they have a bar so if your having a rough day of work or class you can slip in that mid-day relaxer.  Only thing i don't like here is they put sprouts on everything but if you ask for things without them they always leave them off. Been here a bunch never once did they send mine out with sprouts on it.  If your looking for soup and sandwich for cheap in Tempe it comes down to here or dilly's but I think the unique combos on the sandwiches allows a narrow edge to Bison.

High ticket prices, seats don't recline, tiny theater and dirty bathrooms.   That sums this place up. If it hadn't been for a time crunch and a convenient show time i doubt I would have come here and after this won't be coming back. Charging $10 a ticket for a screen the same size as I have seen in houses with crapier surround sound to boot.

Good sushi + a good price = winner. It's hard to find a decent place for sushi that doesn't cost an arm and a leg...except at dozo. Here you get the best of both. I really like the amount of specialty rolls they have here and the favor combos. The prices for the rolls are great too with the specialty rolls topping out at like $11-12 for 8 rather large pieces and they don't skimp on the fish in them. A good judge is that a  negihama roll had not chopped yellowtail but slices of fish and plenty of scallion for i think $5.  The only things keeping this place from a 5 star are that it can take awhile to get the food (even when you are the only people there) and some of the rolls aren't wrapped well so it's hard to pick them up with chopsticks. But These are really outweighed by the quality of the fish and the prices.

Let's start this off by saying my love of the Seattle Seahawks and the fact that this is the official bar of the Arizona Seahawkers Association may tint my view of the place.  That being said I have gone to Skeptical on occasions other than Seahawks games, which for the record are an insanely fun event here, and enjoyed it.  Skeptical is an irish bar but the food is far from your typical irish fare although they have some of the classics like a shepherd's pie that is stellar. My favorite things to get here is the muscles in broth appetizer. Think of this as a bowl of incredibly flavored soup with garlic, leek and red pepper and the added bonus of having a generous serving of muscles and topped with bits of thick bacon. If that doesn't have your mouth watering maybe the kicker of a side of garlic toast will put you over the top.  They also feature a great selection of beers including rotating beers in bottles and on tap. The mainstays such as Guinness, Harp and Kilkenny are always flowing.  There are only two reasons that I have subtracted a star. The first for me is that I am not a fan of the flatbreads, I have tried several and none every hit the spot. Friends have had them and enjoyed but this just doesn't do it for me. The other is a hit and miss issue that has happened only for Seahawks games where I have felt that the servers have been somewhat unavailable and slacking when it comes to checking back in. I understand for big events they have lots of tables and are busy but even with that factored in there are some who just don't seem to care. The only reason I even mention this is because there are some who I have seen work their butts off to keep every drink filled and people happy. When the tables around me see their servers 3-4 times before I see mine, it's an issue.  Check them out but don't dare walk in here wearing enemy colors on game day unless you are prepared to hear all about it from the great fans that show up.

Best chicken fingers I have ever had no questions asked. Always hot and fresh, good quality chicken, great sauces, and good prices.   I can't say how much I crave these fingers somedays without my mouth watering. They are nice big strips of quality chicken that has never been frozen and is always fresh. They are lightly breaded and cooked and never greasy. When ordering i usually come with a friend and we do the special deal where if you get the 3 strip box which is 3 strips, fries, texas toast, 2 sauces and a drink you each get the 4th strip free all for about $10.   The fries here are great and well seasoned and perfect for dipping in sauces which i think there are about 7 of but i always go with 1 special sauce and 1 buffalo as they work well together. I can heat my mouth up with the buffalo and cool it down with the special sauce(great on fries). The texas toast is awesome and has a ton of flavor and just melts in your mouth it is so good.  And to those guys out there thinking 4 strips, fries and toast that won't fill me up i need 8 strips think again as these are big and meaty strips not the tiny little things from McDonald's or Burger King. Usually we all end up with some to take home or force feed that last strip down just so we don't have to stand for another box.  The best part is the owner is always there and truly appreciates your business and always makes sure to thank you for coming in. You can tell he takes pride in his place and it shows.  Tips: They are closed Sunday and Monday and there is like a .50 cent fee for credit/debit because the card companies were giving the owner the shaft on fees.

I don't know why I have a tendency to forget this place exists for months at a time. It's not that I don't like it or that I don't eat chicken tenders. It's really a shame too as this place is locally owned(the owner takes all the orders and is a very friendly guy).   The fingers aren't your mcdonalds fair. They have less breeding and are more of a homestyle than fast food. They chicken flavor is allowed to stand out more than the breading which I like. Plus they are much meatier and fresher than most (not mistaken they are never frozen). They are more like thirds of a breast than a little slice. I get full on 3 and some fries but the box deal with 4 strips, toast, fries, w sauces and a drink is the way to go to have a few leftovers.  If your looking for good chicken tenders this is the place to be. Good food, local owner and a filling meal.  Oh and fyi there is a charge for using credit cards so try and bring cash if you can.

Came here with my girlfriend the other night and it was a very good meal that i was surprised to see in a restaurant in this area. To start with we decided to go with a bottle of wine that while very good was hard to find many priced below $40 a bottle. We selected a blend red wine that was very good enough so that i purchased one at Fry's the following day(but for half the price). To try the most variety and keep our spending to a minimum (being college kids) we decided to go with an order of bruschetta, the special scallop app., and the bison rib-eye.  The bruschetta was the star of the meal and was a true home run. When ordered there are 5-6 different kinds they do and you pick 3 and get two pieces of each. We ordered the Caprese, Smoked Salmon and the Prosciutto. All of them came piled high with toppings and great flavor. The Caprese had some of the best tomatoes and great mozzarella. The Salmon was the slacker of the trio and that isn't a bad place to be, tons of salmon and great olive/caper topping made this a very interesting and tasty dish. The prosciutto was the best with a ton of prosciutto and a great combo of balsamic reduction and pine nuts this one is something that will keep us coming back.  Next was the Salmon Wrapped Scallop appetizer which is the only thing holding this back from a 5 star review. The salmon was good as it was the same as in the bruschetta but it's flavor over powered the scallop flavor. All that came through was the grill flavor and the salmon. The scallop however was perfectly cooked just it was hard to find it's flavor.  The main course was the bison rib-eye which we ordered medium-rare and came with some excellent Guinness mashed potatoes and well cooked and flavored spinach. The rib-eye itself was a bit tougher than i expected but i expect that is because it was a gamier meat than steak which is more of what i had in my head for the taste of bison so that was on me. The steak flavor was great and while i was full about half way through i pushed forward to clear the plate it was so good.  The meal was great and worth the $100 or so after tip we spent. We will be coming here more frequently especially for the bruschetta

Have to say went back the other day and had another fantastic meal and this time had one of the best pieces of filet mignon i have ever had. It was late and my girlfriend and I just want to have the great bruchetta here and split a meal. We again had the caprese and Prosciutto bruchetta but also went with a traditional as well. Once again they were amazing. The balsamic reduction is wonderful. Next we split the Salmon Cakes which had huge hunks of salmon and a wonderful flavor and sauce on them. For a light eater they had enough meat to make a meal. To finish we split the day's special filet that we ordered medium rare and it came out so perfectly cooked and tender it melted in the mouth. The flavor with the glaze (the type of which escapes me now) was mouth watering. May have been one of the best prepared pieces of meat I have ever had and at a very reasonable cost($27). They were out of the green beans they traditionally serve with the dish but that was no issue as they spinach they have is some of my favorite so I was almost happy to have them ask me which vegetable I would like to substitute instead.  To top the all off the service was fantastic and they had a live piano player who did a wonderful job. One of my pet peeves is loud more upscale restaurants where you can't have a conversation. Here we were right by the piano and speaker and were able to hear each other at a near whisper.  My last review was a four star but after having such consistency, great daily specials and great service this is a five star place without a doubt.

They did it again another great meal. Went last night with the girlfriend, her dad in from out of town and her grandparents. We all shared the bruschetta for an app then my gf and I split the scallop salad which was perfect and a lot of food for a split plate with us each getting two scallops loads of bacon plenty of greens. The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.   for dinner all of us had the special which was a rib-eye filet. My girl friend and I split one, so did her grand parents and her dad had his own. All came out perfectly cooked as ordered, tender as can be. this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored. We subbed the green beans for the spinach which wasn't as good as normal as it was a little salty but still good. The guiness mashed potatoes were great as always. Her dad got the asparagus instead of green beans which he raved about. The split portions were plentiful and almost as big as the full portion and the lack of an up charge for splitting is great. All of us left full and when you consider it comes out to $13 per-person for a split entree of a great steak it is a smoking deal. I have to say the meat is better than some of the other places i have been recently (Don and Charlies, home cooked, Yard House)  We also had 2 bottles of wine which were good and the waiter really worked with us to understand what we were looking for and tried to recommend based on our comments on the first bottle and our previous selections (having been in several times he is beginning to recognize the gf and I) as well as keeping it at a very modest price. They even gave us a sample of the 2nd bottle for free before we ordered just to test it. The service here is top notch and they are all very personable and fun to talk to as well as attentive.  I should probably start switching up my eating a bit more but its so hard with a gem like this. Now that we found the wine club I may be here quite a bit more often.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is salty spinach which may be petty but I have to keep the 5 stars for perfection

Was here tonight because Sharon H. wanted some pizza and this was a convenient spot to meet up that we both were interested to try. While walking in i realized this wasn't what i had envisioned it was worth a shot. When you walk in you get a feel very similar to say a Pei Wei where it has that borderline fast food feel but with the made to order mix.  We ordered a caprese salad and a prosciutto and melon pizza. We also got a drink and selected the passion iced tea which was very good. The salad came first and was very good with nice flavoring and good proportioning of the salad/tomato/crustini/mozzarella was excellent to get a bit of each with every bite. It was however lacking in the basil department as it was barely noticable if at all, if that was there this would have been amazing.  As for the pizza it was not what I was expecting at all. It had no sauce (odd for a place called sauce) and the crust was more like a cracker than standard thin crust which is denser and less crisp. This was more along the lines of a crisp tortilla/tostada with cheese. It was topped with prosciutto and melon (honeydew and cantaloupe).  While not what i was expecting that flavor was very good and the ingredients were good. The slicing of the melon made it easy to bite and also prevented it from being overly juicy but without sacrificing taste. The presentation was nice as well with the melon being shaped like a flower over the top of the pizza (see the pic i uploaded).  Pizza wasn't what i was crazing as it wasn't a true pizza and probably more of a lunch/appitizer style pizza than dinner but it was good. The salad was the star of the meal. Overall solid meal.

Been here twice now once for lunch and the other for breakfast. I don't remember exactly what I had for lunch but I remember it was good and I was happy enough to try again. The one thing I remember from the lunch was that the staff was really friendly and super helpful. This continued when I went back a few months later for breakfast.  I got the french toast on challah bread with strawberries. I also got an egg and bacon on the side for a couple buck extra. The food was great and really stands out compared to the lunch which I basically forgot. i didn't want to eat all of the french toast but it was so good I couldn't stop.  I can't say lunch here is thrilling but breakfast is very good, decently priced and the staff is very friendly and helpful. If you are looking for something simple but good for breakfast go here.

I love Costco, I have for many years but it is not some place I would typically choose to write a yelp review about because I think everybody knows what they are getting when they go to one of hear of it; a high quantity of an item for a pretty good savings, and a few taste tests of items while you walk around. Now however Costco has a new tool to make them even better.  The biggest problem with Costco has always been the crowds and lines a check out. Well they have no figured out a way to alleviate that by letting you use your membership card to check out a portable scanner that slides into a nice litte mount on your cart. You scan your items as you add them into your cart and then when you are ready to leave you head to the self checkout it totals your cart and you pay, then you are all done. No waiting in line to hoist 30 packs of Monster or 100 rolls of toilet paper onto the check out conveyor.   This time saver has fixed the problem of long check out lines making Costco even better.  Now if they could just stop with the silly receipt checks at the door on the way out and teach people in the parking lot how to drive they would be all set.

The more I come here the more I like it. The place is clean, ticket prices are reasonable if not a little more expensive than Harkins, and there usually isn't as much of a crowd.  I have also found the people at this location to be a better behaved bunch during the movies.  They also will honor the $1 refill Harkins cups which was always one of my big reasons for going to Harkins theaters all the time.  They don't have the biggest screens in the world though even compared to some other theaters.

I am not the biggest frozen yogurt fan I am more of an ice cream man myself but i must say golden spoon really hits the spot. Nothing too fancy just good old tasty frozen yogurt with your choice of a bunch of toppings if you see fit. I happen to like their plain chocolate with some snowcaps. They do have flavors that switch up so keep your eyes open as new items may just be what your craving.  If your in the mood for ice cream though and don't want all the guilt try golden spoon it won't disappoint.

What a great company.   I have been going to the TEAM AZ bike night (2nd Wendesday of every month at Sidewinder Subs in Gilbert) for about a year now and it is a great time. At a recent one I won a free Advanced Riding Techniques class, something I had wanted to take for a long time.  I took the class a few weeks ago and it was fantastic. I feel like my riding skill improved way beyond what I had expected. We worked body positioning, emergency stopping, cornering, trail braking and obstacle avoidance. It was a lot packed into 1 day.  My instructors Kevin and Michelle were fantastic giving great feedback, keeping things fun while still filling our heads with a ton of knowledge.   The class was done at TeamAZ's facility in gilbert and most of the time was spend out on the practice range on the bikes after doing some in class work first. The exercises were fun and built up skills upon each other. As we progressed I could feel my confidence building and my riding improving.  I highly recommend taking classes with Team AZ for both new and experienced riders. I am now itching to go take the Total Control classes with them.

Groupon: Fail. New York: Fail. Deli: Fail. I am pretty sure most New Yorkers would try this place an tell you to Fugeddaboutit and leave it at that but a yelper shares.  I judge a deli on a few things: the meat, the bread, the sides. Being jewish and from the east coast I hold "new york" deli's to a higher standard and judge them on corned beef/pastrami, potato salad, rye bread and pickles. You get those right you have a happy camper, wrong and i'm cranky. I got the I Love New York which is Corned Beef and Pastrami with Swiss and spicy mustard on Rye, probably my favorite sandwich and potato salad anda  kosher pickle.  Lets start with the main course it was fair and that is being very favorable. The meats were a bit overcooked but nice and hot and had decent flavored and the pastrami had a good amount of pepper to it (which i like). However it was very greasy and soaked the bread and made it slick...not good. The bread itself wasn't bad just generic rye you would buy on the shelf at any grocery. There also wasn't enough mustard on it or much meat probably double the bread to meat on a $9 sandwich. Compared to Chompies where its a nice thin slice of rye and piles of meat. Overall edible but not that enjoyable.  Now the sides where I decided this place struck out like A-rod in the playoff's. I have never had potato salad that was so bland. I am normally not a huge fan of white potato salad but i do enjoy it. This was probably less exciting to my taste buds than a baked potato with no toppings. I tried dumping on pepper to no avail. Next was the pickle which was a whole "kosher dill" and from a new york deli i expect something a bit more more than vlassic out of a jar but that is exactly what i got.  For the money (and for the record i spent $2 on the groupon) this place just doesn't cut the mustard (pun intended). Better options exists for this stuff like Chompies or Goldman's Deli up in scottsdale.

Been here twice now and both times it was excellent. The first time i had the bbq pork sandwich with onion rings. I loved the sandwich as the pork was perfectly cooked and the sauce was wonderful. I love pulled pork sandwiches and this is winner for sure. The onion rings were ok and well flavored but a bit soggy and not as good as i was expecting after seeing them on TV. The garlic fires were another story though as they are excellent and leave you wanting more, the only abd thing is the last few in the bucket get so soaked in grease and oil that they are pretty much un-edible. Also had a milkshake that was ok but nothing to write home about nothing i need here again but if you have a major craving with your lunch it will hit the spot.  The next time i went i got the seared ahi sandwich and it was wonderful. This was worth the trip itself as it has so much flavor and is  just melt in your mouth good. The wasabi sauce is great, not to strong to burn but enough to get a good wasabi flavor. This is something that will keep me coming back for more and more. I loved it. also got the chili cheese fries and they were good but lacking in the cheese department but the chili was very good and the fires are good too. They aren't as good as the garlic fires but very good for chili fries.

This is probably my favorite movie theater of all time. they have big screens even in the smaller theaters, the cine capri may be the best viewing experience ever (even better than imax or any home theater i have seen).  Like all harkins they have the great deal where if you get the souvenir cup you get refils in it for a buck all year. Unlike other harkins i have been too if your cup gets broken or worn down they wont hassel you if you want it replaced.  I also have to say they do a great job with crowds and major releases. They have a great system for getting people in and keeping lines under control, also nice that they provide water when the lines go outside in the summer.  The place is also very clean as well and i have never seen stuff left in a seat, floors really sticky or nasty bathrooms. Also when it comes to refunds on tickets they are great giving you up untill i think it is 30min after the show starts to get a free refund (great if a movie is gonna sell out and you have a friend who may or may not make it).

Just have to update my review because I had some awesome customer service last night. I showed up early for my movie last night and got my ticket and went shopping durring which i some how lost my ticket. I talked to customer service and the lady there was super nice and looked up my purchase on my credit card and told the ticket checker to just let me in. I am sure they get plenty of people trying to pull a scam and get in like this so I was honestly surprised when i didn't have to pay for an extra ticket for my own mistake (which i was fully prepared to do). This was just unexpected and nice to see.

I could just copy my review from Skeptical Chymist as they are both sister pubs and both very good and both Seahawks bars.  I have come here twice now both for seahawks games. All the food has been good especially the corned beef hash breakfast and my favorite at both locations the muscles. The sweet chilli wings are good as well.  For Seahawks games you have to get here early as the sight lines to the big screen aren't great and there are quite a few tables that you pretty much can't see.  The beer selection is good and they often has deals on Guinness and other Irish beers.  Fun place to come and watch a game with good food and drinks.

I have to say I like Qdoba over chipotle about 75% of the time but the reason really isn't taste as i think they are about equal as run of the mill fast-ish mexican food. I like the mexican gumbo here, the taco salad has a tortilla shell, they always have discount coupons, the loyalty program is great and they don't want $1.50 for guacamole on a burrito like the other guys. The location is also good but with the new chipotle across the street (literally) it's Qdoba that wins out.  All that said i tend towards the gumbo,which is really just the burrito guts with tortilla soup on top, with varying meats each time but the new shredder pork is good in it. It's very filling and hits the spot for me. The burritos when i get them are packed full and the chips and queso or guac are always good.  If your looking for a wowing taste of mexican this isn't it but if you need a quick lunch or dinner and want a burrito or some gumbo it's not a bad place. Look in the ASU coupon books for great deals and if you get 10 meals the 11th is on them plus the occasional extra with the loyalty card.

Went here for the first time last night and it was great. Had the winter warmer which was a great winter beer that is served with ginger snaps and some hot wings. Wings were nice and crisp. They weren't as hot as I like(but I like really really hot) but the flavor was good and a little different from the norm in a good way.   Service was great as well. Holding a 5th star until I can try a few more beers and food since I didn't sample much.

Ok words can't quite describe just how good I think this place it. My parents were in town for thanksgiving and then back again a few weeks later for graduation. After coming to Roka for the first time thanksgiving weekend my dad's first idea for dinner when they got back to town was to come again.  The family favorite on the menu is either the rice and mushroom hot pot or the butterfish. Both are fantastic. I could eat the hot pot for lunch alone. Nothing we had in either visit was bad but the let down was probably the kimchi dumplings, not becuase they weren't good but because all the other food just blew us away. The waygu beef sushi was fantastic and just melts in your mouth. Even the miso soup is better than any I have had before.  One of the best touches I saw was fresh grated wasabi coming with an order of tuna. I had never seen it grated right from the root before, only the green paste. It's small touches like this that makes Roka a step above the rest.  The housemade drinks (i think it's call surgue) are very good but they also have a very nice selection of alcohols. A martini with the ginger vodka is a great choice.  The service is also top notch with drinks being filled promptly, menu items being very well explained and just a great dining experience.  Hands down this has become a top 5 family favorite restaurant for us, worldwide.

I'd probably give a place like this more points if they weren't so damn over priced and had a bit better execution. A fairly small tuna poke appetizer and 2 not that special rolls for over $30 without drinks really?  The poke was ok but not anything like a traditional poke and for some reason they add what seems to be spicy tuna sauce to the tuna first which i don't get and made it a bit too spicy for Sharon H. without mixing it with the rest of the dish. I liked it overall but not as poke which is a very specific taste to me this seemed to lack.   The Sunkissed roll was a good idea but needs better execution. I want avocado and salmon with each bite not on alternating pieces. Oh and premium avocado has good flavor and isn't bland. I did like the special sauce. A little less onion or maybe not raw onion might help too.  The anago tempura roll just misses the mark for me and was over priced for what it was as it was tempura eel with cucumber, mint and fried garlic. at $11 most places have an eel and cucmber roll for $5 and the little slivers of garlic and sprig of mint aren't worth an extra $6. Plus the thing was just too many conflicting flavors and the garlic was over cooked to being so hard it was like biting a piece of rock it actually hurt a bit and didn't feel natural.  To top this all off i just didn't feel the fish quality was up to par. The salmon especially didn't have the normal taste. I will give sushi places a pass when its cheap and not that high quality but when it's expensive and lacking its a problem. The salmon had a fishy taste and didn't have that normal salmon flavor which stood out the most.

Was here awhile back and Sharon H's review will sum it for atmosphere but i will try and cover my feelings on the taste.  The bruchetta is great.  Yeah really that simple. I haven't tried much but bruchetta here but haven't really been disappointed either. Even the ones that "haven't been a fan of" of the ones i tried when i have mixed and matched when getting to select I still would order over bruchetta at most places as they are still very good. Did try a pizza once and wasn't amazed but nothing stood out (it's been awhile since that). The bruchetta however comes to mind every time i hear the word.  Oh and the service is very friendly and attentive. One night I was in and they had just finished a major catering event and it had said on the front door that the kitchen was going to be slow until about the time we arrived. Yet when we ordered and it took a bit to get the food (barely a delay in my book and if I hadn't been apologized to by the waiter probably wouldn't have know it was longer than normal) we got a nice little discount.

Been here a couple times now and have to say I really like this place. Not because the fish quality is amazing or the rolls are great but because it goes everything well. Nothing is really outstanding but the price and the rest is just solid For a $20 price you get miso soup, salad, edamame, choice or tempura or gyoza, ice cream and all you can eat sushi. That is a great deal and the sushi list is huge featuring a ton of specialty rolls and nigiri. I have never left this place not feeling like I got more than my moneys worth even on nights where I ate light.  As for the food like I said it is solid but not spectacular. The fish isn't bad but isn't out of this world either. It's just good. Unlike some other AYCE places I am not afraid to try things on the menu here and venture out and I am a bit of a fish snob and won't do that unless i feel comfortable with the level of quality at a place. I have found some things I am not a fan of her but nothing i felt was bad quality or stale. I am a big fan of a few of the specialty rolls who's name escapes me but I think it's the mido roll and the ahha roll. Also i like there spicy scallop which I don't like most places.  The services is also good here and the place is clean. You really aren't going to go wrong for the price and really worth the try. Only reason I withhold a 5th star is because the fish is just average and at a sushi place that is my key grade. Of the AYCE places around though this one is a solid pick.

Not bad for sushi but not great either as this place can be really hit or miss. Some days the rolls are wrapped perfect and other days they are  looser than MC Hammer pants. The fact that the location is convenient to my girlfriends house makes this an easy stop somedays to fill a sushi craving but not destination sushi. Went the other day and the albacore and salmon sashimi was cut odd so that it was stringy but the Zushi Kee roll was very good and flavorful as was the other roll i had. Other times I have been things have been just fine. Once again they have changed ownership so hopefully things will stabilize. I will probably keep coming back when I have a craving and I am near by but if i want great sushi this is not where I am headed.

Went there for take out this afternoon and I have to say i am impressed with the food. I ordered a Panang Chicken and a cup of Tom Kha soup w/Beef. I ordered them a 4 star spicy out of 5. The Tom Kha was a little spicier than i would have expected but very good flavor and was full off meat and mushrooms. I think had i ordered it at a 3 it would have been perfect as even at 4 it was very spicy but because of the other flavors I still wanted to finish it all. The Panang was good as well and just enough heat to my liking but others who don't want their tongues burning may be better at a 2 or 3 star. Again like with the soup there was plenty of meat and veggies as well as plenty of sauce which i love mixing with rice. When ordering for lunch the Panang also includes rice and a veggie egg roll which while not the best or biggest egg roll or the most rice are still a great deal for just under $8. With the total meal coming to $14 after tax i was very pleased and had enough left over for small meal or snack.

I decided to come here the other day after sampling the food at the Yelp in Bloom event. I have to say it was just as good as at the event and well worth the trip.  I got the braised beef and mashed potato sandwich just like they sampled at the even and i have to say it was great. There was a ton of flavor and I loved the rosemary. The meat was well cooked and for the price it was great. My only issue was that the meat to potato/bread ratio wasn't the best so it got somewhat sticky when chewing with all of it, especially how thick the bread is. Just a bit less potato and a bit more meat and it would be perfect.  For the price it is great and this is a place i will revisit for sure.  P.s. if you plan to shake your drink a bit put a lid on it or it will spill. But on the plus side the staff won't laugh at you too much when you spill on yourself but Sharon H. will.

This place is awesome from the pho to the amazing customer service. The pho is wonderful with great flavors, plenty of aromatics, and good meat. The broth is a bit spicer than most pho places but I really like it. Plus the price and portion size is great. The only thing preventing this from being 5 stars is that I wasn't a fan of the Thai iced tea with shaved ice in it and or wasn't a strong enough flavor for me.   The customer service is great very helpful, attentive and get your food quickly. The owner is also a very nice guy who talks to everyone making sure things are enjoyable. What really stood out is that after going in once he remembered me and that we had talked about yelp. It was only a minute or two conversation but when I came in a week or so later he remembered. That is just unbeatable when it comes to remembering customers and showing appreciation towards them.   This is a place I will be coming to again and again

I was not impressed by this and I really wanted to be.   I got the gumbo and shrimp po-boy. I have had po-boy's in St. Louis which shares a lot of food culture with Louisiana and this one just wasn't up to par. It seemed like frozen popcorn shrimp on some bread with a ton of mayo and some lettuce.   The gumbo was kind of bland and reminded me of the stuff from a progresso can.  I may be willing to give this place another shot but it won't be until after I finish exploring my other lunch options in the area.

Great Food? Check. Quality Service? Check. Fun environnent? Check. Good beers on tap? Check. Food I crave? Double check.  That about sums up all you need to know about cornish but if you need to know more just think of the best hot pocket you ever had, multiple the quality by a million and you have a pasty. I have tried numerous items from here ranging from the homemade sausage salad (too big for a single sitting so leftovers=winning) to the lovely bit 'o salmon to the strawberry pavlova dessert and it is all great.   My biggest problem coming to this place is the near pannick attack get from having to choose from too many great options. I'd tell you what my favorite pasty was but that would imply that one is better than the others which simply isn't true. Plus they have something for pretty much everybody, the only thing is if you are super picky pastys are cooked to order but not made to order so ingredients can't be swapped. Even then anybody I have ever come with has been able to find something.

I was not impressed at all with this place at all. I went with a 4 other people. 3 of us ordered milkshakes and 1 got one of the $1 scoops. I tried two flavor to start and they were ok but nothing special or better than your average baskin Robbins.   It was odd that on a Sunday afternoon only one employee was there and she was slow as can be, very nice but slow, took probably 4-5 minutes per milkshake to be made and she went one at a time.   The cost was astronomical as well with 2 smalls running around $10 and not worth it. The only thing keeping this review was two star was that I was impessed with the final consistancy of the milkshake and it wasn't bad tasting just not anything impressive.

I love this place and can't say enough good things about the gelato flavor or the service here. I can't count how many times i have been or how many flavors i have tried but i have never been disappointed.  I have many conversations with owner when there (a very nice guy who takes care to remember his regulars) about flavors and family and such. One thing i love is they always have new flavors to go with the season like pumpkin in october and apple pie at thanksgiving (made by throwing 2 whole pies into the mix).  The best flavor is the blueberry in my opinion as it has so much rich flavor and texture and when combined with my next favorite strawberry it is a great berry blend.  They also work well with groups as my motorcycle club held our 3rd anniversary even there and they were very accommodating.

Let me start off saying my rating is probably on the favorable side for this place. The food is in the 3-3.5 star range but the price alone is worth an extra star.  The food is like most Chinese places, it's solid but not spectacular. I usually get the lunch combo to go and stick to my favorites like Kung Pao or Orange Chicken. They fit the bill and are tasty if unassuming. The Kung Pao lacks the kick I would like and is a little more runny on the sauce then I like but that is more of preference than taste. A little spicy mustard kicks the kung pao right up. The orange chicken is orange chicken.  Like I said I get the lunch combo which includes an egg roll (pretty decent one too) and 1 crab rangoon along with some fried rice. All that with a fairly healthy size portion of the main course and all that is only $5. So you really can't beat the deal.  I also like the hot and sour soup which is slightly above-par for what you find most places.  On the service side they are quick and friendly. I can call on my way out the door of work and they will have my food ready by the time i get there 5-10 minutes later.  So if you are craving some Chinese for lunch you should probably stop by here, you won't be wow'd but you won't be disappointed either.   P.S. I think it is awesome that they sell NFL Team hats too.

I came in here due to the coupons in the student coupon books. I wasn't expecting much from a sandwich shop in a liquor store but was pleasantly surprised. The meat was good and the veggies were pretty fresh. The only knock i would have is that it the girl, who was really friendly and got all toppings just right, making it takes awhile to get through it and I was the only one there. I am sure I will be back as I think it was better than going to subway or port-o-subs close to campus.

Been here twice now and i have to say this i a pretty good burger but the smashfries are the true star. The first time I went i got a made to order burger adding lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, cheddar, smash sauce, pickle and bacon on a 1/3 pound burger and traditional bun. This was a good juicy burger with the bacon being pretty tasty. It was also pretty filling for it's size.  The next time i got the arizona burger which is a 1/3 pound burger, peper jack cheese(?), chipotle mayo, guacamole, lettuce, onion, jalepeno, and some spicy bun the type escapes me. The flavors worked well together and i was impressed that while a spicy flavor came through so did each individual element. Even with the jalepenos there wasn't a really fire or burn to overpower the burger but a nice heat. It was a good specialty burger but i would prefer grilled onions on it.  The thing that will keep me coming back however is that smashfries which are great and the rosemary and garlic taste is just a perfect balance. No ketchup needed here the flavors are enough themselves. I have had the fries at 5 Guys, Delux, Joe's farm grill and these may be my favorite.  Also a nice touch with the close location to ASU is that they do except sun dollars. For a price that falls between McDonalds and more gourmet burger places this is a winner for flavor and value. With other choices like Chuckbox, 5 Guys, Whataburger, and 4 Peaks in the area this still is the best.

So about 2 months ago I had my first success at escaping Costco for under $100 per trip, even when I went for just some toilet paper. Finally thinking I had managed to control my spending consistently I relaxed a bit. The problem was I had just begun to realize the beauty that is Total Wine around the same time. Now instead of having a problem where I can't escape Costco without spending more than I planned it's Total Wine that is the direct enemy of my bank account.  Half my problem is that I'm not just a beer guy or a vodka guy or a rum guy or a bourbon guy, I'm a good alcohol guy and that means I roam the store looking for good things. I don't just go for a 6-Pack and leave with a 6-Pack i get a 6-pack, 3 craft bombers, and a bottle of bourbon and thoughts of that aged rum dancing in my head.  for instance I went to pick up a single bottle of a special release beer the other day (Firestone Walker Double DBA) and was only going to get that bottle....yeah by the time I was done I needed a wine bottle case to fit all the beer I walked out with.  The staff is friendly and can come up with some good recommendations, to whomever told me about the Pikes Peak Porter thank you, and the prices are generally pretty low. Their regular prices on some bottles of things are lower than others sale prices.

I love this place and I think the fact that I am the duke here shows it.  The beer selection is great with some very good flavors. The Wet Snout and Red Rover are two of my favorites. However the seasonals and specials are usually pretty impressive. They also have very reasonable prices  for the beer. The sampler is a great way to try everything and is plenty of beer.  I also like the atmosphere. This is a brewery and a bar and doesn't want to be any more. It is like a great blend of hanging out in a buddies basement and relaxing at the bar. They have a popcorn machine in the corner, some fun board and card games, and TV's playing sports or movies. It's a fun place to come unwind for 30 minutes or a few hours.   They don't have food aside from the aforementioned popcorn but they welcome you ordering in or bringing food with you.  The service has also been great with knowledgable and friendly staff. If you have a question about a beer or want a suggestion they are great at helping you out.  Now please don't start flooding the place with business because I still want to be able to get a seat when I show up.

This place is a pretty nice little spot in Tempe. They are in the building where extreme pita used to be next to blockbuster.  I came based on the yelp reviews and ordered an italian beef with gardinera. It was very good. Nice and wet and the gardinera is nice and hot. The fries were also fantastic. there was so much food that i couldn't even finish on a day where i went in hungry.  It was also fun that they were doing a Man vs Food style competition all day with a challenge to eat a 3lbs burger with toppings in 10 minutes. Two guys tried it while i watched and made for a fun time. The staff made sure it was a fun event.

I don't have much to say about this place beyond it being my favorite place for dessert on any given night and anybody who knows me knows that is high praise.  I love the rotating flavors here as they are usually pretty tasty and live up to their name. Snickers yogurt tastes like a snickers bar, Rootbeer Float tastes like one, and creamsicle is just amazing.  The staff is always friendly and helpful. Another big thing for me is that the places is always clean especially around the food items.  They do a rewards system that works out to 1 free for every 10. Checking in on yelp also gives you a buy one get one free every time.

I am not really one to review something as simple as buying a pair of shoes but the guys here the other day really did enough to warrent me giving them so props. I came in looking for a shoe in a specific size and color that i couldnt find anywhere else. When i called on the phone they said they only had the color i wanted in the size up from what i wanted but they had it in another color in the size i wanted. they said to come in try it and if i liked it they would have it delivered to my door for the same price.  Turns out that after i put some orthodics in the shoes for my flat feet i needed the larger size anyway so i was set to buy it. I had left my coupon at home however but instead of just telling me too bad so said they went above and beyond and to make it easy on me took 15% off my entire order (including socks and the shoe inserts) versus the $10 off planned (pretty much $22 bucks).  They were great in helping me get the best fit, best orthotic, and the best deal.  I will come shop here again based on the amazing service i got

The customer service I have received from Cellars has been second to know. A few months back I got into contact with Mickey from Cellars on Facebook via the Arizona Craft Beer Lovers group. Originally I was talking to him about some rare beers he had in and if he would be willing to hold them for me for an hour or so while I drove over from Tempe and sure enough he was.   That was awesome service enough that when i started looking for a limited release bottle of bourbon (Woodford Reserve Masters Collection) I contacted Mickey again. He told me that it hadn't been released yet and he would keep in contact. Sure enough every so often he would update me on the ETA for the bottles. When the time came that he got the bottles he not only let me know he gave me a great deal on the price and held a bottle for myself and a friend for a few hours.  Yet Mickey didn't just stop there when I was in the store picking them up he and talked and he recognized that I really appreciated good bourbon so he offered to sell me an even more rare bottle that is near impossible to get (those of you who know what time of the year it is can guess what that may be). This was a bottle he didn't even have on the shelves and I would have never known he had but he offered it to me knowing it would be going to a good home. I walked out of the store feeling like I hit the jackpot of some excellent drinking nights to come.  On top of the great service Cellars also has an incredible selection of beers both in the bottles/cans but for growler fills as well. My buddy questioned my vision when I read how much some of the fills cost. They have beers on tap that could sell for double what they ask. Not to mention the fact that they have a huge selection for growler fills so you are pretty much guaranteed to find something that floats your boat.  Cellars may be on the other side of town from me but Mickey has made it worth the drive with excellent service and a wonderful selection. If you are looking for something special or just need to stock up check Cellars out.

I can't review this place for food but i can for the party and man is it a party. I have been coming here all summer long (before the college crowd showed back up) and have really enjoyed it. The drinks are mixed just the way i like (lots of booze little else) and the price is just what I like (reasonable).  I love that they have sailor jerry's here so that for $5 I get a stiff rum and coke that tastes good and packs a punch (if you like captain and coke try a sailor jerry's it tastes better in my mind and is higher proof for usually the same price).   I have also found the staff to be very friendly especially the bartenders if you get them when the place isn't swapped and even the bouncers are nice enough with small talk when checking ID's which is rare on Mill. I know first hand I have an out of state ID and these guys like something else but are always polite about it and when i have it ready are sure to thank me for being prepared. Not the typical grunting or head motions.  Quickly this is becoming a favorite spot on Mill and as the weather cools the patio with a Dj will be a great spot.

Tried here twice now once just days after they opened and again a few days ago and I have to say I am not impressed at paying twice subway prices for half the sandwich.  The meat here is ok but nothing great and I think the meat at whole foods next store is a whole lot better tasting and less processed. They lack some very simple sub veggies like pickles and olives. I can't believe they don't have pickle chips or at least spears but will charge $1 for the same claussen pickle i can get a jar of for $5.  The sandwich itself is overpriced and small at about the same length of a subway 6" but half the width. At $7 for this sub I would at least expect more meat than subway but it is about the same.  I also have had my order done incorrectly twice now and i didn't think no mayo, add oil and vinegar with all the veggies and hot peppers is that complex.  For the money I am going to walk in to whole foods and get one of their great sandwhiches for about a $1 more and are twice the size and usually leave me with leftovers and while I am there I may even buy a jar of pickles.

I tried this place the other day after seeing all the coupons in my ASU deal books and my car was very dirty from all the fall leaves and dirt going around. When I say my car was dirty I really mean it hadn't been washed in a month plus and was caked in dirty and was begging for a bath. So I tried this place. As an ASU student I got and automatic discount which I think was $2 but may have been $3. You can get the same if you mention the entrance off university off university being blocked (see my quick tip).  Anyway I got the top tier wash which i think was a total of $7-8 after discount and included a tire scrub which I needed bad. The lady who was working the wash was very friendly and helpful and even told me how to sign up for the text service to get a free air freshener and deals in the future. She guided me in and I was set to go.  I was very impressed how clean the car got. minus a few spots i knew i was gonna need to attack with some bug and tar remover and a few nooks and crannies on the wheels it did a great job even getting a few spots i didn't think it would. The free vacuums are great too and very convenient.   Overall way better than gas station washes and minus the interior clean about the same quality as I have been getting from Danny's the last few trips (i have not been happy for the price and even complained). They offer some monthly fee unlimited wash services i may look into for the winter months.

I really have become a fan of this place. I have tried a couple different soups (although like a few others when ordering miso got somethings else once), the gyoza, boba and coffee.  Everything is very tasty I just love the beef Republic ramen with a bit of sesame chili oil added. For the price it is a good filling meal and when you add the $1 off coupon from the campus discount books its perfect. The gyoza are great crisp but not too crisp and the flavor and the flavor of the sauce is great and at 3 for $2 not a bad little side dish with the soup.  They also make a pretty good mocha which I tried the other day and the boba's are fun but I have only had the thai tea version.  The staff here is very good too they are super helpful if you aren't sure what you want, get things out quickly, if its not packed check in on you (rare for a counter order place) and they are just good all around.

If you are a fan of potstickers this is the place for you.  It's been a bit since I have been here and my memory is a bit fuzzy on the details but I do remember some amazing potstickers that were enormous and enough to make a meal out of at a fair price. I remember they were full of meat and the noodle case was not to thick but enough to hold things together when you cut into it and provide solid doughy goodness not the slimy sort found elsewhere.    Half the reason I'm doing this review is so I remind myself to come back with a group of friends to try some more of menu items and share an order of potstickers so I don't leave over stuffed.   I will be sure to update my review when I get back over there.

Paid $10 for a wash and ended up with tons of water spots and streaks because they have the thing going so fast it spends about a split second under the dryer.  There were also still dirty spots and areas that weren't clean once I was done. Best bet is to skip this unless you are looking for a quick rinse and then to dry it yourself.  Also wasn't a fan of having to sit through the monthly deal special spiel even after I said I wasn't interested..

Been here twice now and tried two different dogs and two sides. Nothing was disappointing. I have tried both the sweet and spicy dog and the hana dog. Both dogs were great and had very distinct high points. The sweet and spicy does something very rare for me and actually gets me to enjoy pineapple mixed with other foods. I this dog had great flavors all over including the dog itself which was perfectly cooked and the right amount of heat. The hana was just a stack of messy amazingness that had a real mexican flair. The bacon is the real standout adding the great bacon flavor and a crunch that gives the textures some depth.  The sides were good to. The chili is not some canned stuff and is good. The tater tots are just awesome though and nice crispy outside and that soft pillowy inside you crave.  If you want a gourmet hot dog this place is not going to let you down.

I just don't get the fascination with this place. They don't do a bad burger but they also don't do anything special either and still charge too much for it. I don't think their quality is that much higher over say jack in the Box or In N Out yet it's $10+ for a basic burger and some fries.  Sorry but if you are going to charge premium prices don't make a sub-par burger, if I am paying $7 for a basic cheeseburger don't tell me the only way you will make it is well done.   The fires are good but they aren't anything to write home about either, I do suggest them with the cajun seasoning though as it does add a little something.  The one plus they have going is free peanuts in the shell, not exactly sure how that ties into a burger joint but I still like them.

If you don't like haunted houses this review will do nothing to help you but if you do it will motivate you to go.   It's very simple bring a group of friends, several who scare easy, add in a few shots before hand and then go have a blast.   Just make sure you get the VIP passes because the 2nd time through can be more fun than the first.

A sub place that hosts bike nights, has beer on tap and has cute girls working? Count me in.   I have been here twice now for the Team Arizona bike nights, second wednesday of every month, and been impressed both times. While not a huge crowd the place has been busy and they do a good job churning out the food in a timely manner.  The first thing you think when you walk in is that it feels like a Quiznoes...well that is because it was one in the past. Next you will be asked what you want and what choices of toppings and dressings you want. I like the spicy Italian combo  with everything hold the mayo. The meats here a good and seem more like at a traditional deli than a subway where it is over processed meats. I am not sure but wouldn't be surprised if it was sliced in house. All the veggies taste fresh and for a pickle lover like me they have very tasty ones.  I haven't tried them but I have been told the wings and fries are good here as well. Coming for bike night I usually show up with a group of friends and everybody has been pretty universal in the praise for the food.  Also the prices are good including a 8" Italian combo for $2.99 that you really can't beat price wise. If you check in on yelp they have a check in offer as well.   My only complaint is this place isn't closer to me and/or in an area I normally travel to but when I am in the area I am stopping in for more and when bike night rolls around doesn't matter if it's 100+ degrees I am heading over.

Wow I absolutely love this place. I have been here twice now, once a bit over a year ago and again last week for restaurant week. The food is amazing.  The item that I remember from my first visit that got me to come back was the bacon dipped chocolate s'mores. They are amazing i love the savory sweet combo of the bacon and the homemade marshmallows are fantastic. The peanut butter is also great and doesn't have that super creamy over processed taste that stuff like Skippy has.  To reverse course the meal started with the sausage and grits appetizer which was fantastic. Little bits of sun dried tomato mixed in made this a fantastic dish. The sausage had just the right amount of heat to pair perfectly with grits. The bread that we got was fantastic as well. The honey wheat was my favorite but the jalapeno cheese was really good too.  I also got the zucchini cakes which were phenomenal. I love fried zucchini and fresh and these were the best of both worlds. The flavors that were packed in while still keeping the taste of the zucchini was great. The aoili that it came with was really good as well. Pretty sure it was a cilantro lime but had some other flavors too, I think lemongrass was one I picked up.  The main course was the pork loin with baked beans and coleslaw. Our waiter, who was fantastic, strongly recommend this and I couldn't have been happier taking his suggestion. This was like the fanciest BBQ you could possibly have. It took classic BBQ flavors and paired it with a perfectly cooked chop. I am not a huge coleslaw fan but I ate every bite on this plate. Was a great blend of upscale cuisine and backyard BBQ.   Overall it was a fantastic meal with great service and very good food. Can't wait to come back and try some more. Very happy to have been here and to have Beckett's table be my 100th yelp review.

You had me at Po' Boy...Since my parents moved to St. Louis I learned of the amazingness that is the Po' Boy sandwich and to find a gourmet one in Phoenix is awesome.  I really stumbled upon them from the 4 Peaks facebook page (it's important for me to have my beer 411) saying that they would be at the new tap room. It got late and I got hungry and my desire to cook was far outweighed by my desire for the half pot roast half pulled pork special I saw advertised on facebook. The mention of rosemary and garlic tots sealed the deal and off I went towards the tap room.  As I approached I was handed a printed "secret menu" but I had already seen it online and seen and made up my mind and ordered. As I waited I chatted with the guy who I think is the owner on everything from the craft beer industry to my job search, he even gave me a tip of where to look for a position. 5 minutes later I had my Po' Boy and home I went.  The flavors were spot on for a bbq Po' Boy. The pot roast was perfectly fall apart in our mouth tender and the pork was nice and juicy with a nice smokey taste and there was plenty of both on there. And I am not normally a fan of slaw but the zesty slaw was awesome. The tots were far from your old school cafeteria tots they packed a rosemary punch and a garlic kick and were nice and crispy even after being in the sealed container for 10 minutes seaming up.  For the price you aren't going to beat it.  Hopefully I can track these guys down again and try some of their other creations. Ask for  the secret menu it has some killer combos.

Ding Ding Ding we have a winner in the over crowded tempe thai battle royal. In a tiny town with about as many thai restaurants as gas stations this one just jumped way out ahead of the pack.  I have been looking for one thai place that just jumps out and hits all the right taste buds and reminds me of the great thai I would find in the Pacific Northwest. This one comes the closest. The massaman curry was excellent in the hot spice with a nice burn but distinct flavors still coming thru. The chicken satay was great and the peanut sauce was perfect and not just peanut butter with chilli paste like most places. I loved the eggplant dish with beef as it was the first time in a long time i got an eggplant dish where it had plenty of eggplant AND it wasnt just mush. Plus the flavor of the eggplant, basil, spices and beef all came through.  Top this all off with friendly service and perfectly reasonable prices this is a true winner. I am just sad I am .3 miles outside the deliver zone. Maybe if a offer up an arm or a leg I can get it.

With so many froyo options popping up all over now it can get hard to choose. For me I like zoyo for a couple reasons including selection(large), price (average), location (close) and rewards program.  Starting with the selection Zoyo has plenty of yogurt selections to pick from and they change it up all the time. I am a big fan of the zoatmeal cookie and salted carmel. Their fruit flavors aren't my favorite but they are not bad either they just tend to be a little tart, even the non-tart varieties. I try to get a new flavor every time I come in. They also keep things well frozen unlike other places it's rare I get a soupy yogurt coming out.  The toppings selection is pretty typical but where Zoyo stands out is the fresh fruit. They always have good looking fresh berries that don't look like they have been sitting for hours and taste really good. I usually always pick up bad berries everywhere else but han't had a bad one here. The toppings also have a bit of turn over with new crushed candies or crazy varieties like rock candy or mochi showing up. If you can't find a topping you like here I'd be shocked.  As for the location it's convenient to my place and is always clean. Pretty much every time I walk in an employee is cleaning or wiping down equipment. In a do it yourself place like this I think keeping it clean is key.  The buy 10 get 1 free rewards card is great especially if you go with somebody else because really it's 5 trips then you have a free one. it's not a crazy rewards program but it is more then other places.  So check it out I don't think you will be disappointed.

It's quick, tasty, healthy and affordable what more do you really need to know?  Oh so you want to know about the food well it's pretty much rice and meat but done the right way. This is chicken or beef chopped up and put on top of either brown or white rice, I always go brown since it's better for you. The mixture is topped off with some magic sauce which is Korean BBQ sauce which is a lot like teriyaki sauce. You can also get veggies too but I rarely do.  I usually get the combo plate which adds a little salad with some tasty sesame dressing and an orange. I think the price is about $9 OTD and is enough food for at least one meal if not a meal and little snack later.  They also have a punch card program so you can earn free meals too.

Talk about great customer service in unforeseen circumstances. I was at Stand Up Live last thursday to see Amy Schumer headline. When the show did not kick off on time began to think something was up. Not long after the owner came out and announced Amy was sick and on her way to the hospital. He said to make it up to us not only would the show continue that night but we would be refunded for our tickets, given tickets to see Jeff Ross the following weekend, and when Amy reschedules free tickets to that show. Just the refund and Ross tickets would have been plenty.  But them making it up to us didn't end there. After the feature comedienne who opens for Amy and would have been last up they announced they had somebody who wanted to send us home happy and brought out Kevin Farley (Chris's brother) to do a set. When he was done they said they had 1 more surprise and out walked David Spade (who I had known was in attendance from seeing a table reserved for him when I went to the bathroom pre-show).  Farley and Spade were great and wanted to make sure everybody went home happy  and we did.   Only reason this places looses a star is because the seating is very cramped with 4 people to a table designed for 2. However the service was nice in that they automatically asked about split checks so you don't have to worry about trying to split a check with strangers like some other places *Cough*Tempe Improv*cough*. There were times when we wanted out servers attention and couldn't get it due to the odd seating and him not checking back for awhile at a time.  Really my experience was a 4.5 star and they handled a tough situation in excellent fashion. Highly recommend checking out a show here. Ticket prices aren't bad and drinks were decent.

After reading the reviews on yelp I was expecting more from this place. They didn't seem to have anything scary more just gross and people getting in your face.   The make up was good and I liked the bodies hanging from the roof room but the scariest moments were when the guy walking around the outside would drop his shovel on the ground and drag it.  Price wasn't bad but considering I paid for VIP and still spent more time in line than the actual house when it wasn't that busy is pretty bad.

The name sounds fancy and exotic and you might not know what you are getting but in the end they are high quality, fresh popsicles.  I had one who's name was very spanish and I can't remember but it was a bananas foster flavor and it was great. That flambéed taste of bananas with a hint of alcohol was amazing. I loved the big and plentiful chunks of  banana in it.  Also got to try the Orange cream which was like a high quality creamsicle that we all know and love from childhood.  If you are on mill and feel like something sweet this is well worth the stop. I want to head back soon to try the spicy chocolate.

Usually come here on Friday nights with my friends who are regulars.  Food is pretty solid the lamb meatballs and Johnny's nachos are very popular with our group. Even their ranch dressing is really good and I am not a big ranch fan. I also like the Guinness stew.  The only thing keeping this place from being a full 5 stars is that it's probably a bit on the pricy side for what it is. Beers start at $6 (i think I haven't had one cheaper) and pretty much any food item is $10+ with sandwiches at $12. Shave a couple bucks off and they would be in solid 5 star contention.  The service here is also good as all the servers are friendly, keep up well with groups and splitting checks (always hard since our group can be anywhere from 4-12), and they are willing to joke around with us and not throw us out (always a possibility with our non-pc humor and discussions).

I have actually been here twice, once for a yelp elite event and again on my own.  Both times I thought the food was good they do have pretty high quality sushi.  The rolls have some pretty good combos and are tasty too.  I was surprised how much food my groupon got me at lunch time. The lunch sashimi combo was a pretty generous portions and they even gave a bit extra because it was the end of the piece of fish and the slices were smaller. They also have some lunch specials that add on sake at a really low price that escapes me right now.  It is a little bit of a drive out of the way for me but I have no problem going back. They also have groupons pretty often so it's a good way to get a good meal in without breaking the bank.

My review play by play style:   Came in and was greeted by the staff. Started looking at the menu and decided on a Papa K (spinach, mushroom, ham, pepper jack) and an iced mocha. Paying using Square Pay on the iPad being used as a register is awesome, screw the credit card companies.   As I sit here waiting for my crepe I can only think that if the food is as awesome as the service my mouth is in for a treat. Everybody is helpful, friendly and enthusiastic. The owner is out talking to everyone and letting us know he appreciates us coming in, something I love seeing business owners do.  For my mocha pretty quick and it is really good. I am not a huge coffee fan and don't order them often but this one is good. Maybe it's a bit extra chocolate making me happy but it works. Not to mention its not all ice like Starbucks is.   Holy flavor explosion in my mouth that is tasty. Just got the crepe (maybe 5 minutes wait if that) and took a bite. That is great. I got a first bite full of flavor and the edge of the crepe with a little but of just crispy cheese oozing out. This thing is also a big crepe and stuffed to the max. All the flavors go great and the pepper jack is spicy but not over powering the spinach and mushroom.   The flavors work very well together and it's  fantastic. The crepe itself is just right and takes me back to being in Paris. The crepe is the right density to be filling but not heavy, and light but still be filling.  The density is the biggest problem I have seen with crepes outside of France.   This thing is packed full and filling me up quick. My stomach is saying stop but my taste buds and brain are screaming for another bite. The saltiness of the ham is addictive with smoky flavor.   Ok finished the crepe and totally filled, amazing considering how hungry I was. Pretty quickly the staff sees I am done and  clears the table for me while I finish mocha and this review.   Final thoughts this place is great and I cant wait to come back and try the other crepes. Oh crap I see a strawberry topped one next to me, I need to get out of here before I order a desert.

I really like this place and can't get enough of it. As one of the few places that is close enough to my work for me to get there and back during my lunch break this is a true go to for me.  I tried the chicken shawarma my first time there and have a hard time convincing myself to try anything else since it was so goo. The flavors are fantastic and the chicken is moist and perfectly cooked. The portion on the plate is great too as it comes with plenty of rice and salad along with a warm pita and some tahini sauce.  I did try the steak as well and while it was still really good I wouldn't pick it over the chicken unless I needed a change of pace meal.   The prices are right inline with what you would expect and I am always greeted warmly and with great customer service, I do take out a lot and the phone service is just as nice and orders ready when they say they are.  If you are in the area I highly recommend checking them out.

Come for the beer stay for the people watching.  With a crazy long beer list featuring some of the best local brews along with rare and hard to find drafts and bottle WoB is a spot any beer lover can get behind. When it comes to a view it may not have scenic sunsets and valley views but on any given weekend night it has fantastic views of the debauchery that is Mill Ave. Watch as a guy is shot down trying to pull a number on a corner or as a girl is carried to the car after a few too many PBR's at Moonshine. Don't forget the jesus lovers trying to convince ASU students they should give up their ways mid-party.  While I haven't sampled much in the food department the wings I had were solid and the pretzel with bacon beer cheese was not only massive it was just the right density for a snack and incredibly enough without a costco bottle of salt on it.

I came here sort of on a whim the other night as it popped up in a yelp search with good reviews.  I walked in not really not knowing what to expect. Lucky for me the guy behind the counter was amazingly helpful and walked me through everything. Not only was I given a rundown of how things work but also a really vivid description of the flavor profiles. I was really impressed by how helpful and detailed he was. This wasn't your standard run down of well chose a meat, salsa and toppings it gave me guidance of how things paired.  Using this guidance I walked out with an order of 2 enchiladas (one pork and one chicken) and the corn chowder with beef. I topped it with a bunch of sauces including a cilantro cream that was really tasty. I also added the pickled onions that really added some punch to the dish. These enchiladas were great and so was the chowder. While it may not look like much it was a filling meal, glad I decided to pass on the 3rd enchilada.  Only complaint was the the beef was a bit on the salty side but that's just me.  I will be back.

Found this place on Yelp when looking for an alternative to my normal lunch spots.  I am a fan of Hawaiian BBQ even if I forget it from time to time and go awhile without eating it.  I got the mixed combo from here with chicken, beef and short ribs. They were all pretty solid for BBQ my only issues were that I like a little more sauce on mine than it had and I was a bit underwhelmed on the quantity as it looked like more but was just a bunch of cabbage underneath. The flavors were really good I think the chicken was my favorite but the beef was close, a bit more sauce could swing this as the beef needed a bit more moisture. Everything is clearly cooked fresh which is a nice bonus.   The macaroni salad which is key for Hawaiian BBQ was on point and very tasty, just wish there was a bit more.  The price was pretty fair but like I said would expect a bit more meat. I'll be back soon and try some of the other items on the menu.

Okay so I must admit I wasn't exactly the most enthusiastic visitor to Zoo Lights but I had a date who had been talking for weeks about how she wanted to go so we went.  I have to say it is pretty cool if for nothing more than walking around the zoo at night being a different feel. The lights aren't super impressive but the atmosphere is pretty cool. I was underwhelmed by the "New musical light show" at the lake and felt that using some different songs and maybe some more impressive light schemes would have been better.  As for a date location it's a pretty good spot and on a cold night gives plenty of reason to hold somebody special close...if you know what I am saying. So makes this spot a fun place to walk around for an hour or two, maybe even snag a cup of hot chocolate while you're at it.

This place is Pho Ao Sen with a new name, a menu redesign and less taste. I used to consider Pho Ao Sen my number 2 go to for Pho due to it's quality and proximity to me. Now I probably won't be back. The Pho Tai Chin I had seemed to lack any substantial flavor in the broth, my key to some good pho, and the meat just seemed sub par. It used to be the broth was solid but not great, now it is below the curve.   I wanted them to still be at least decent for those times when for some reason I need some pho when UnPhoGettable (best pho I have had so far) is closed. Now I probably won't be back, with the number of places to get pho expanding this place is getting bumped from my list.

You really can't beat this place for the price. At no more than $2 for a plate  and each plate having 2-6 pieces you can get a full meal in for cheap.  They have a few good rolls like the Haiwian roll and the salmon lover (I think that was the name). The seaweed salad isn't bad either. What is nice is that if something isn't coming by on the belt here you can always order it from your server, but they have a pretty good selection on the belt.  The fish quality isn't the highest here but it also isn't horrible or going to make you sick, just don't try to compare it to that of Roka Akor or Nobu. If you are having a sushi craving or just want a cheap sushi meal it will be satisfying.  I think the best part is that you can eat until you are full here and still get out for under $20. My only addition to that is that if you are really starving then some of the $20 all you can eat places around town may end up saving you a couple bucks. It can be fun to see how high you can get your pile of old dishes. The one knock on the different plates costing different amounts is some plates aren't 100% clear what color they are so you may under estimate a bit, but it's max a $1 difference per plate.  I have gone to the Teharu in Scottsdale and Tempe and my advice is to go at times that are a bit busier as they will have more selection on the belts and the odds it was freshly made is higher than at off peak times. That really goes for any conveyor style sushi place though.  Overall I like Teharu as a low cost sushi craving filler, it's not the pinacle of fine sushi experiences but it's a fun and tasty stop.

Anybody knows me knows that I love Four Peaks, especially their beers. This new location for them focuses on what they do best which is beer. The tasting room as they call it is just that. A nice room with a view into the brewery for tasting beer. The room is very nice and modern with TV's for watching sports and plenty of seating.  They don't serve food here but they will server up your favorite beers. To make up for the lack of food they have nightly visits from different food trucks to serve up  some yummy food. I am pretty sure they also let you call for delivery as well.  So if you are looking to grab a beer without the hassle of the 8th Street location crowds or the trip to Scottsdale check out this little gem. They have all the beers four peaks has and right now even have some Pumpkin Porter that is exclusive to this location.  The location is a bit tricky to find but trust me it is there. I would give you specifics but I still want to be able to walk in and grab a seat without fighting off a crowd.

You know how sometimes you hear about how good a place is so much that by the time you try it the hype is so high the place can't possibly meet your expectations? Well this is not that place. Matt's delivers on everything you have heard (sadly this includes the wait).  Matt's is basically your favorite local breakfast spot on steroids. Rather than a run of the mill piece of bacon it's a thick cut peppered slice cooked to perfection, that is from the Pork Shop (see my review on them) in Queen Creek.  The eggs? Yeah they are awesome.  On a recent trip I went and got the Chop and chick which was a couple of great eggs coupled with a slap of pork that was not only gigantic but super flavorful. The hash browns are about as perfect as hash browns can be crispy outside but not burned and great potato goodness inside.  The coffee here was also really good and exactly what a cup of regular old coffee should be.  Service was great and they are very quick to make sure you are taken care of. The prices are right in line with what they should be especially for the quality of the food.  Only thing is be prepared for a wait if you here as they are pretty busy especially on the weekends. But you are welcome to go inside and grab a cup of coffee while you wait.

Came here as part of a UYE set up by Norm and I am really glad I made it. This place isn't your run of the mill chinese food. It is authentic (according to Norm) and full of unique flavors that differ from the chains and take out places. They actually pack a lot of flavor into their dishes and they are nice and spicy which I love but at the same time the heat isn't the only thing you taste.  Since we all went semi-family style with it I got try a lot of dishes so here are some quick hits:  -Kung Pao Chicken - My go to dish that is normally fairly lack luster but consistent elsewhere here actually had robust flavor and some healthy heat.  -Szechuan Peppers- foudn these in various dishes and they were spicy but at the same time kind of mouth numbing which gave a unique taste and sensation. I liked it others may not.  -Pork Belly (aka the Bacon part) - was really tasty and had some great sweet and spicy dumplings.  -Onions and lamb- was my favorite just a great flavor combo here and well executed with great flavor of cumin.  -Hot and sour- Good but lacked the hot part, especially when compared to other dishes on the night.  -Bitter melon - It's an experience you need to try at least once. Get it to share since you probably won't eat the entire dish.  -Eggplant - well cooked and flavor not over powered. Highly recommended.  -Seafood and sizzling rice (rice cakes) - This was one of the stars of the night.   -Lamb ribs and spicy peppers - great dish as the ribs were nice and crispy went well with the peppers that give the dish a nice punch.  Considering they have 2 large groups in the place at the same time and one of the servers was obviously new they did a great job getting things handled. The staff answered a lot of questions and took care of us well.  I highly recommend this place as the quality and taste of the food can't be beat and the prices are right in line with your grab and go Chinese food places.

I will preface this with saying that I am not a huge fan of going to clubs, especially in Scottsdale.  I have to say this place picks up right where Myst left off: overpriced, underwhelming, and disappointing.  Here is the first issue: a $10 cover even when the club is empty at 10:30 on a Saturday. Next issue up is the quality of drinks, if I order a vodka soda and you are going to charge me $8 for well i should probably be able to at least taste a hint of vodka. Considering I had a better made vodka soda with better vodka and more of it across the street at El Hefe for 25% less and didn't have to pay a cover thats not good.  For a saturday night the club was fairly empty and probably because of the above stated issues. I rarely go to scottsdale to begin with and when I return this place won't be on my list.

I may have found burger nirvana in this place. I had heard about it several times including at the Yelp Elite Salty Sow event and then randomly from a buddy who was there and knowing I am a foodie said it would be right up my alley. So I planned to go with one of my riding buddies and lo and behold as I was waiting for him 2 of my other friends showed up (we didn't know the other would be there). Obviously word is going around about this place.  I have to say I was worried that my expectations were too high going in having heard of the wonder that was the parmesan truffle fries or the high quality meat in the burgers. Turn out I didn't have any reason to be worried at all.  This place hits the nail on the head for burgers. I had the primetime which was cooked perfectly and had such a great combo of flavors. It is easily in my top 5 burgers of all time and that is good company. I was really impressed at just how well all the flavors went together. I am glad I picked that burger as it is clearly a well crafted work of art.   I did have a hard time picking as all the other burgers sounded great too. My friends had the El Diablo and Goodnight burgers and i can honestly say I don't think I have seen burgers get devoured that fast before. Needless to say we were all impressed.  The fries didn't disappoint and the truffle sauce with them is amazing. We also indulged in some shakes. i have the Chocolate Stout Shake and it was great, the stout flavor was subtle but fantastic.  The food is a sure fire winner here....the ordering process not so much. The process for ordering isn't bad but it's awkward. What normally happens is you go through a line to order and get assigned at table where food is then brought to you. However since one buddy and I were ordering after the others we were told we could order right from the server at the table. The same was true of ordering additional food like the shakes. It was nice and our server was great it just was a bit odd. Not sure if this changes during big rushes though as we were there when it was late and emptying out.  In summary this place has awesome food go try it.

I had lunch here today and as per usual Short Leash delivered.  I had the currywurst Oktoberfest special which was a red curry (think curry ketchup) sauce, chopped onion rings, currywurst (i think might have been knockwurst), served on top of nan bread. It was really good and every bite was flavor packed.  I also had a side salad which had a really tasty dressing but might have been a bit too much of it on it.  I want to come back again and try some of the apps and beers they have on tap. Sadly I went during lunch on a work day so I couldn't have any drinks (yes all of you who know me and are rolling your eyes I do know how to pass up a beer).

I can't say enough good things about the work these guys have been doing. Their beers are just phenomenal and get so much flavor. I think the best example of this is that I am not a sour beer fan but I try them from time to time, AZWBC maybe the only place where I have tried the sours and actually ordered a full beer; and not only that but I have done so multiple times.  These guys are always coming up with new flavors for beer and the full range from sours to sweet stouts are incredible.  For all the credit they get for their beers the food here is just as good and makes the whole experience complete. My favorite are the frenched wings, which are chicken wings but more done in the style of rack of lamb with the nice trimmed bone at the top to grab onto. They are amazingly flavorful (I like the sweet and spicy) and literally fall off the bone tender, like watch out tender because the bone can slide right out as the chicken just melts in your mouth. The sliders are also great. I also had the taco tuesday tacos last week and for a guy who isn't a fan of fruit in his food I loved the grilled pineapple with the curry chicken taco.  Doesn't matter if you come for the beer or the food this place is a winner.

Bei blew me away with a spicy tuna bowl that is both fantastically good but a true deal as well. The bowl is huge and not full of just rice there is a substantial quantity of spicy tuna along with avacado and some radish. I love to get it for a togo meal especially at the $12 price. It's pretty filling all by itself and most of the time I can get away with just that.  I have branched out and tried a few other things as well including the squid salad (solid) and the spicy salmon salad (fish was good but didn't mesh well with the dressing). I have also had a few of the rolls here and they were good but I can't remember which they were.  I have been impressed with the quality of the fish here and the prices. A nice plus is the free miso soup when you check in on yelp.

I came here twice to watch a Seahawks game after the Scottsdale Seahawks group moved here when American Junkie closed and was disappointed both times. The first time wasn't horrible but the food wasn't great and servers made me feel like I was inconveniencing them every time I asked for another drink or anything at all. Top that off with food that took forever to show up, it shouldn't take that long to throw some cheese on a plate with some toast (I had the burrata) and sauce, and it wasn't even good it was bland.  The second time I came was a disaster. The guy who was serving us was just a rude dick the entire time and was too busy chit chatting with co-workers and watching the games himself to take care of us. This was an early game so I ordered the eggs benedict, while it wasn't bad the fact that it sat for several minutes on the bar while out server was too busy to be bothered to do his job chit chatted away and stared at his female co-workers. Finally one of the women behind the bar saw this and brought us our food.  At the end when I got my bill it noticed extra charges for stuff I never even asked for such as bacon which did show up on my plate but I never asked for it and just assumed it came with breakfast...I know crazy logic jump on my part. There was some other charge as well for something I didn't even get. I just remember this was $3 extra in charges on a $20 bill and while $3 isn't an issue the point was I shouldn't be charged for it. I pointed it out to the server and he went away in huff to look at it. He comes back 5 minutes later and says in a fantastically condescending tone "So you're arguing over three dollars?" At which point I tell him yes I am and I never ordered that stuff. He leaves in a huff again and comes back and just drops the revised bill and walks off. I wonder if he got upset about there not being $3 for a tip on there for him.  This place was dropped by the Scottsdale Seahawks group after that game because I wasn't the only one with these issues.  This place is on the fast track to being yet another in the long line of failed bars in old town. Save your time and money and go elsewhere.

So about a week and a half after having some of the best BBQ St. Louis has to offer (Pappy's for those in the know, check my prior reviews) I was back in AZ and ready for some. Having a week off and several friends who were fellow fans of BBQ I decided it was time to make the trip over to Little Miss while I was able to get there early and not have to wait long. Got there about 10:30 and by 11:10 I had a nice plate of juicy meat in front of me ready to go.  Lucky enough for me I came on a thursday which meant it was Pastrami day and a platter full of that, fatty brisket, beans, potato salad and an extra housemade sausage for good measure I was ready to indulge in all the essentials for BBQ.  I have to say I was blown away by the flavors and the tenderness of the meat hear. The pastrami was incredible with a blend of spices that was out of this world there was a distinct subtle sweetness that I couldn't put my finger but it was a hit probably the best I have ever had. The fatty brisket was just killer as well with a great tenderness and ton of great smoked flavor. The biggest compliment I can give these two meats is that while I tried them with the various sauces I preferred them without and I am usually the type to slather my BBQ in some sauce.  The homemade sausage was really good as well and work getting with some great flavor but was overshadowed by the others. The beans are more liked pulled pork with some beans added, in other words outstanding. The potato also didn't disappoint.  One of the staff also noticed my buddies 2 young children weren't eating anything when told they were picky eaters he said "let me get the a rib to try kids tend to love them" and he was nice enough to bring a rib for each youngster. While the kids still didn't go for it after a little test bite the rest of us decided to try and they were very good and fall apart tender as well. In the absence of the Pastrami I would pair the ribs and brisket in a heartbeat for a great meal.  The finishing touch was the pecan pie which while small is rich enough it should be shared but it will go quick as the smokey sweetness and flaky crust is perfect capper to a great meal.  Compared to Pappy's I may actually give the edge to Little Miss because of the Pastrami but it's neck and neck on ribs and brisket so the end result is that AZ has a BBQ spot that can go toe to toe with some of the best in the midwest.  Don't miss out and make the time to come here. It's worth the wait.

I really like coming to this theater for shows the convenience and comfort is the perfect way to watch a movie. No worrying to fight over seats or have to show up early to the big premiers just so you don't end up in the front row. Instead I can go online and reserve seats for me and my friends days or weeks in advance.  Then the night of the show I can just wonder in 5 minutes before showtime, take my seat, hit the button to lay back and get comfy in the recliner and enjoy the show. How much for all of this? $8 a seat if you have the $10 AMC stubs card that also give you discounts at the concessions and $10 back for every $100 spent. It's $9 after the convenience fee if you don't have the stubs card which still a great deal.  They also validate for 4 hours for the parking garage next door so you get enough time for dinner on mill before or after the movie.  Now the one downside to these theaters is that they don't have the best climate control. I've been here in summer when it's on the warm side inside (not good with pleather seats and I have been in the winter when I have had to get up multiple times to ask for them to warm the place up. Also since people seem to be really comfortable and feel at home too many cell phones seem to pop out during the show, maybe they should install a faraday cage to block signals.  Over all this place is a winner and the rumors of them getting a liquor license to go with the new brewery being added downstairs/next door could really up the game.

I should preface this by saying my review is based entirely on Seahawks game day experiences here at Wasted Grain the official bar of the Scottsdale Seahawkers. The reason I say this is I am looking at this through the lense of being at a jammed packed bar that is trying to handle people who roam around and order food and drinks at a rapid pace.  That said they handle the events as well as any bar I have ever seen if not better. Service is usually prompt and polite with drinks getting refreshed when needed. The food is not spectacular but it is pretty solid. Somewhat disappointed to see that this year they have cut down the menu to a game day specific short list. It still has some good stuff but I liked having all the options. I am guessing it was tough to get things out quickly that way although I usually thought times matched what I expected based on how busy they were.  I was here for numerous games last season and the super bowl and thought they did a great job every time and look forward to more games this season.

I hate having to write reviews like this but my experience here was sub-par.  To start with I got their Vanilla Porter which while ok was nothing special and nothing distinctive about it. I paired that with an order of the machaca tacos ignoring the advice of my buddy to get the mac and cheese. For an $11 dollar taco plate I was expecting more than the 2 barely filled tacos with condiment cups of rice and beans (that weren't particularly hot either). The flavor was actually fairly bland and underwhelming and not filling. This was basically 2 street tacos and tiny sides for $11, it should be a $7-8 plate not one of the most expensive things on the menu.  However the worst was yet to come. About 20 minutes after I ate as I was driving home I became very very queezy and nauseous, enough that I rolled down the window in 50 degree temps for fresh air. I rushed home and let's just say I got home just in time. I have never had something like that happen before. It was over pretty quick but was still another 7-8 hours before I was able to eat again. I know food poising usually takes a bit but the sudden onset and the fact I hadn't eaten in 12+ hours (and the last meal was something I have all the time) makes believe something was amiss with the tacos.  Based on the fact my buddies enjoyed their meals and I have heard good things from other I will probably come back and try here again but I will be avoiding the tacos.

So Opa Life has taken over the space formally occupied by My Big Fat Greek Express as apparently the parent company of Opa Life bought out MBFGE per my conversation with the woman working the counter who is apparently from corporate helping launch the store.  The first thing I noticed here was that they did a really nice job renovating the old space that was dingy and tired space. This is nice and refreshing.  Sadly the second thing I noticed was the sticker shock of this place compared to MBFGE which was pretty reasonable. I think they are up a couple bucks up across the board.  I got the special which was a combo deal of chicken pita, drink and a side for $9. The food was fine but lacking flavor. The flavors were pretty blank on the pita it was pretty much red onion and taziki for taste the chicken was band and over cooked.  They just opened so I will give them a bit and try again and see if it's any different but with Pita Shack closer to me and I think a bit more flavor it will be hard to convince myself to come this way often.

I'm not sure who decided to combine a southern style seafood restaurant with a BBQ joint but that man deserves some sort of humanitarian award for his efforts in making stomachs and taste buds very excited.  Came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday night after hearing great reviews from other yelpers. We did have about a 45 minute wait but it was well worth it and kind of fun to track using the app they use.  I got the shrimp with sausage, potatoes, corn and the trifecta sauce medium spicy. My girlfriend got the snow crab with trifecta sauce mild. Everything was fantastic and thank god we got the warning from the waiter that the spices run hot as even the medium gave me a nice little burn without impacting flavor. The flavors were fantastic and there is just something fun about getting all that juicy goodness by peeling your food by hand and dunking in the sauce. My only gripe was that my shrimp were over cooked just enough to get a bit mealy.   The corn was fantastic and just absorbed all the butter it was cooked in and the trifecta sauce making for a ton of flavor that hits your taste buds in a rush. The potatoes were good as well and what you expect. The   Now you're probably asking yourself about the BBQ I mentioned and why I haven't discussed that, the answer is I was saving the best for last. Much like we did with our meal where we pushed the BBQ to the side while the seafood took the focus. In hindsight waiting may have been a mistake. We ordered a 1/2lbs of the pulled pork along with some corn bread and man was it good. Not only was it good it was it good it was some of the best pulled pork I have had, and not just in AZ. While not quite on par with my favorites in St. Louis it also wasn't far being either. Was not dried out, had a great smokey flavor while other subtleties of the spice rub used came through. Not to mention that was the biggest 1/2lbs pile of meat I have seen. The BBQ sauce was good as well but not even needed and that says a lot from a sauce lover like me. The cornbread was also great not too mealy and just the right level of sweetness.  I will be back at Angry Crab soon for more delicious goodness especially when it felt like we dined like kings and queens for a very reasonable price.

I am updating my review for the alternate location and to add to my experiences with TEAM AZ.  I have been going to the TEAM AZ bike night (2nd Wednesday of every month at Sidewinder Subs in Gilbert) for over a year now and it is a great time. At a one I won a free Advanced Riding Techniques class, something I had wanted to take for a long time.  I took the class and it was fantastic. I feel like my riding skill improved way beyond what I had expected. We worked body positioning, emergency stopping, cornering, trail braking and obstacle avoidance. It was a lot packed into 1 day.  My instructors Kevin and Michelle were fantastic giving great feedback, keeping things fun while still filling our heads with a ton of knowledge.   The class was done at TeamAZ's facility in gilbert and most of the time was spent out on the practice range on the bikes after doing some in class work first. The exercises were fun and built up skills upon each other. As we progressed I could feel my confidence building and my riding improving.  I also managed to win a skill practice series class (I am really good at trivia) and used that to take their slow speed maneuvering class. The Skills practice series classes are done one tuesday a month at night for a couple of hours and are designed to sharpen a specific skill. In this case it was working at slow speed which I know for me and others is the most difficult. By the time I was done I was feeling a lot more confident with my slow speed work and I even won the "slow drags," think the opposite of a regular drag race. It was a lot of fun and very informative.  I highly recommend taking classes with Team AZ for both new and experienced riders. I am now itching to go take the Total Control classes with them and my new bike. They are great company with great teachers.

While the food here tasted ok there was only 2 items that were really good the spicy tuna handroll and yellowtail scallion hand roll I ordered from the menu. The stuff on the conveyor was ok but when you realize that for many rolls it's 4 pieces for $3.25 it adds up quick.  Ended up with a $30 bill and didn't feel very full. Then within a few hours the stomach issues hit and lasted for 3 days. I can't 100% place the blame here but considering my previous few meals were homemade leftovers from the 2 days prior I would be hard pressed to think that was it.  Also the wait staff seemed disoriented and weren't very attentive for simple things like drinks and dishes for soy sauce.  Sorry but for the price I am driving up the 51 to Moto for better higher quality or heading south to Mido in Tempe for AYCE for $22.

When you call yourself the king of gyros you are setting a high bar for yourself before somebody even steps in the door. However this spot makes a gyro that while not locking up the title of King clearly it certainly has a solid claim to the throne.  I came here late on a Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend for lunch and we were both pretty hungry so we went with the combo's with greek salad's. For $16 we got 2 filled to the brim with meat gyros, 2 salads, and 2 sodas.   There isn't much to say about the salad, it's a greek salad with the usual fixings but what stood out was the peppers, cucumber and tomato all tasted fresh. Salads had a good mix of peppers, onions, cucumber and tomato so nothing dominated. Feta and dressing were standard fare.  The gyro's stood out. I got the fireman's gyro which is a standard gyro with giardiniera peppers (a nod to the heavy Chicago roots of this place). The first thing I noticed when presented with the gyro was just how much meat it had in it (having been freshly shaved to order from the spit). This thing was loaded with meat. The next thing was that the tzatziki was a thicker heavier version than the more smooth salad dressing kind most places, this was more of a spread or dip. It had great dill flavor and really complimented the meat. When taking a bite of this the flavors of the juicy meat with the spicy giardiniera and refreshing cooling flavors of the tzatziki was just perfect.  The place was clean and the staff friendly and personable. I also liked being able to see into the prep area with the spinning spits of chicken and gyro meat, it made my mouth water from the moment I walked in seeing the delicious and juicy meats. Watching them shave the gyro meat to order was a great way to showcase the freshness.  The bottom line was the gyro was very tasty and filling with a ton of meat for a great price. Both my girlfriend and I were so fully we ended up only needing a light dinner late. There are some other good gyro places that may be a bit more authentic to the middle eastern style but the King of Gyros is easily in contention for the Iron Throne of Gyros.

If you remember this spot as Lobby's then you remember exactly what this place is.  Aside from a minor name change and a different color scheme this place is literally the same everything. The Italian beef is just as good as you remember the fries are just as crisp and the fry sauce is just as good.  Even the guy making the burgers is the same. I actually spoke to the new owner who actually helped build the original Lobbys menu and train the staff and he said when Lobby left the business he bought it and everything is running the same as it ever was.  I love the food here and it is a favorite spot of mine for lunch or a good filling meal. The Italian beef and sausage combo is still my favorite but the burgers are on point. The Italian beef can be favorably compared to portillos and in my mind is probably better.  My only gripe is a carry over from Lobbys which is you should get at least 1 fry sauce free when you order frys. It shouldn't be extra. That is a minor complaint though and I still love this place/

This place has some good beers and an interesting setup as an old house. You really are coming here in a slightly questionable area of town because they make good stuff like Jomax or Black Caddis. The variants on Jomax and Caddis are where they really show their stuff adding different flavors to the mix and they aren't subtle around here.   They really specialize in the darker porters and stouts as far as I am concerned that is where they shine but they try other fun stuff like Chai Jolly which was a chai spiced beer that was good if you like chai. For IPA fans the wrenovation is a solid beer but won't really stand out.  The big issue I have with this place is size and temperature. It's a small place, like i said like somebody's house, which gives it an intimate feel but when they have a decent amount of people (say 20+) it feels packed. The other part of that is that both times I have been (fall and spring) the AC hasn't been great so it's really warm. Not exactly the conditions I want when drinking a dark beer. Maybe it's just because I have been on special release days so it may vary in the off times and be more comfortable.  The staff is really helpful and gets to people quickly at the bar which is a plus.  Good spot and if you are worried about the heat it's worth it to stop by and get a growler to go.

I feel like at this point it's just piling on to what others have said to add my comments as an invited Yelp Elite member to this event.  I think you can find from all the other reviews how disorganized the experience was for us which started with being told to be there an hour earlier than needed, them running an hour late, total confusion on getting the tickets and what they wanted us to do. On top of that we were told to just skip the lines and go to the front to get the samples. I realized quickly that if we didn't it was going to take a full day to try all the places we were to judge. So I decided that I would do what I was told and skip to the front and ask for the taster, this would have been much easier if we had some sort of ID badge or wristband to show we were judges and allowed to do this. Heard many others complain as we did this.  On the event side of things I think there was poor communication between event staff and vendors on things like judging, sample sizes, VIP lines and even general timing. It was pretty crazy that for a sample ticket many vendors were giving out toothpick sized samples. Given the prices per ticket were $2 that is a major rip off. Not to mention the vendors who said they weren't even doing it. I will say that others were very generous (I can't remember the name of the taco truck right next to the alcohol area but they were giving a fully loaded taco which was great).  Other not so great things: a lack of water and drinks early on there is no excuse to running out of drinks an hour into an event especially in AZ, passing off store bought food as small plate tasters and charging a ticket for them (Rip-Off), having so many people with VIP bracelets it defeats the purpose.  Now for the few things that showed promise because there were some: a fair amount of vendors showed up to this first year event but more variety would be nice, the location makes for a good spot and layout (although some seating areas might be nice), the beer selection was very good for an event like this with some great local options to try, and the turn out was actually pretty solid for people who hopefully come back.  I think this year was very much a learning experience for those in charge of this and hopefully all the feedback leads them to make changes and improve planning and communication for next year as with some work this can actually be a solid event.

So for full disclosure I was invited to be a beta tester here as apparently they felt like getting an engineer in the room would show them what they need to make sure people don't take apart (I played this role well).  Anyways I was supposed to do this with a group of 4 but one bailed last minute. Being 3 engineers we figured sure we got this. We did eventually get it after using all the clues (you get 3) and some stressful times but it was close and significantly harder. Having 1-2 more people would have really helped. Would say no less than 4. Was told the max group size is 8 which would be about right before getting too many cooks in the kitchen.  Have to say it was very fun and intense especially the last few minutes as everything came together as time was winding down and we rushed to get out. The feeling of accomplishment at the end was great and really felt like my mind was going 90 miles per hour.  This would make a great team building exercise or even a fun double date. The one thing to consider is that the door to the venue is a bit discreet but consider finding it your first step to get your mind ready for the challenges within.

I am a big fan of fired pie the chipotle meets pizza concept works for me. I love to load my pizza up with toppings but always hate how expensive it gets at the typical pizza places. Here i can load up a pizza with what ever creative combo I want and it's all the same price that is actually really cheap for a made to order personal pizza.  One of the things I like is that they have a ton of choices for meats including stuff like capicola, 2 kinds of sausage, and meatball that most places don't carry. They also have a good arrangement of veggies and toppings that all seem fresh.  This spot is also close to Mill so it makes for a good food option before seeing a movie or hitting the bars without having to deal with the typical Mill pricing.
