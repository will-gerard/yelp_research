I'm really liking the house-turned-bar concept and the Leaf represents the best of what I had the chance to see in this part of the city.   For first timers, be prepared to question whether or not the dark house your walking up to is actually a bar. There are no signs and rarely is someone working the door. Inside its pretty dark, what with candles being the primary source of light, but it works with the space. This is a great little spot to keep things low key and converse with your fellow patrons. Art adorns the walls in every nook and cranny and music ranges from jazzy to dub step, depending on the night. And service wasn't as bad as advertised, at least not for me.   Sadly, there are two reasons why I cant go full on for The Lost Leaf. No full bar. And beer sucks. But, that's me. Definitely check it out and good luck grabbing a table.

Went with a group of 8 and had fairly high expectations even though one in the party had been to Phoenix previously and vaguely remembered having a crappy meal here. But, I sided with Yelp and pushed the group on. I wish I hadn't.   Around the table, someone ordered the pork chop and found it pretty tasty but that was about as good a thing anyone else could say about their dish. I shared the Pad Thai with the doubter and it was a bland sticky mass of noodles with way too many large blocks of tofu. In short, it sucked. But, it did give me a better appreciation for Thai back home in Houston.  Service, on the other hand, was great. Orders came out quickly. And, it was reasonably priced. Just stay away from the Pad Thai.

Walked upstairs to the sounds of the DJ sampling a Billie Holliday-ish sound-alike, saw 2001: A Space Odyssey playing on the screen, and knew I was hooked.   It's hip yet laid back and serves PHX well. Seating was abundant and comfortable. Service was quick but I'm subtracting points for dousing one of my JWBs with Coke instead of a splash of water. Still, with the atmosphere and music, SideBar was one of my favorite spots in town. (Where's my ascot!?! (:D))  I didn't mind the walk from the rail but if you find yourself with a group that can't hoof more than a few blocks without complaining, then hail a cab.   4.1 Stars.
