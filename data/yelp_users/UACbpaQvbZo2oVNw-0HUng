It was ok until I hear the owner cussing at a pregnant waitress and the bartender . I have never seen such a display of hatred, i do not recommend this place. The owner is less than deserving of anyone's business.

I have been to many chiropractors in my life but none compare to Dr. Steve.  His passion for his patients is second to none. I always feel more excited and refreshed after my treatments at Global Chiropractic.   I highly recommend Dr Steve to anyone that needs a chiropractor or better yet wants the best one.    He helped me with my headaches, and shoulder pain i was having for years, when traditional medical doctors could not figure it out Dr. Steve knew exactly what do do and he did it.  I now see him regularly becuase if I keep up my adjustments I dont seem to get sick anymore.  I love it!!!   Thanks Dr. Steve you have truly changed my life i cant imagine going back and feeling like i was, I didnt even know how bad I was until you made me feel so much better!   Steve
