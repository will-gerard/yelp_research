Best Chinese food in Phoenix I've been coming for years , my favorite dishes are the cucumber and garlic, celery peanut,  pork and bamboo shoot, salt and pepper shrimp ,  I have gotten in a rut and keep ordering my favorites and not tried some Of the more interesting items on the menu.  this place would be great for 8 or 10 people they got big round table with the lazy Susan to try a bunch of dishes .  I would love to see this place to do a monthly tasting event where people sign up in advance and all sit together and try some of the more exotic dishes and the Chef could come out and talk to the group about the meal an preparation . Keep up the good work

melon salad needed a little salt to bring out the flavor, if you don't have salt on the table you need to get it right,  had the fish trio the portions of ahi and butter fish were very small the salmon was a bit bigger, all were cooked correctly and tasted good, the rice was served on a seperate plate which made mixing with the sauces akward, the bok choy side consisted of one leaf, must be running low.  Dessert was ok they did a great job making scratch creme brulee taste like instant and the pineapple thingy was the high light of the evening, if I was headed home from a winning time at the casino and my car broke down out front I would think about stopping in for a bite

I was just told they stop serving coffee at 10pm, not good, I am sorry it makes no sense to me I am curious how long the policy will last.  I love the coffee and the atmosphere

I'm done eating and I thought I would put down a few thoughts and questions.  The space is great the look, fixtures the bar and counter are all done well I love the view of the kitchen. We came for a late breakfast , oatmeal was good we wished all the accompaniments had come separately oatmeal is a dish we think a lot of people might have their own special mix for.  I had a standard eggs, bacon, potato, toast.  I asked for a extra egg it never showed up but my girlfriend order one egg scrambled on the side an I'm pretty sure my extra egg over easy made it in to her frying pan.    I don't get the counter service,  a number of places around town have it.  How much do I tip and how much are your servers getting paid?  What do I do if I feel that my visit was inadequate ? It seemed you were over staffed yet I didn't get the quality attention I expect.  A waiter needs the tips at the end to stay motivated.  I'm a waiter and I would hate having to run food here and not know from looking at the ticket who ordered which item, auction every plate of food at a table is bad service.  Your staff Is great they are friendly and comfortable with their roles, If any thing they could get pushed to work harder and make a few more bucks  with tips and hourly I hope your FOH staff is averaging $20 per hour
