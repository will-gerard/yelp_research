This is my go to spot. Service is consistently immaculate no matter who you get. Tom the bartender pays attention to the customers names and what they drink with everyone I see. You can't go wrong with any of the food. I've tried it all and love it all. I generally get the Thai tuna roll with a kale salad as it's clean and fresh. Atmosphere is beautiful..lots of celebrities stop by here as they generally stay in the Biltmore area.

I don't like to be a Yelp snitch but candidly, Not even sure how this place got 3.5 average stars. Ordered eggplant and green curry with chicken. Eggplant wasnt even near cooked and tasted like leather. Curry tasted like salty water (a ton of water) with a few pieces of chicken and the rest was nothing but bamboo shoots and more bamboo shoots. I know people have their off days but this was waaaay off. I do not recommend this place if you like Thai food. Too many other spots to get your fix. I wouldn't give a 1 unless I got sick.

One of the best brunch spots in Phoenix. Food is outstanding, service is impeccable, etc. they Need to bring back the baked egg dish though. Found out the other day it was discontinued!  Sad day!!

When I'm in downtown Phoenix, I frequently visit this spot and sit at the martini bar. Everything from their classic cocktails to their outstanding food, the bartenders also cut and prepare fresh meat and cheese platters right in front of you. On weekends, DJ up-top will spin classic hiphop music..just enough to set the vibe for good conversation and bumping your head but not loud enough where it's a club.

Nice spot. Great bar and happy hour. Good is great and innovative. I've met the owner as is a really nice guy with a great vision for what he wants the restaurant to be.

Best out in the neighborhood in my view. Well balanced pho broth. I come here several times a week. Best 6 bucks money can buy for lunch!  I get the 114 no tripe.

This is a hidden gem for sure!  Everything from the service, atmosphere, food innovation and taste, home run!  The owner personally introduced himself to us, the service (front and back of the house) was educated, informative, attentive, and passionate.  Very cool, romantic or lounge type vibe to the area.  Food was very creative.  Pizzas are outstanding.  The attention to details in flavor profile was on point too.  I had the chicken marsala and that extra flare of Grand Marnier in there adding the citrus notes was on point!  I'm scared to tell the world about this place b/c I want to be able to get a table any time I want!  :)
