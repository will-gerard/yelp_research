Maybe it was just lucky timing, but I walked into Cigna Urgent care at 755 E McDowell and within FIVE minutes was brought back by a nurse for some screening.  Within ten minutes, i was seen by Dr. Michael Esmay.  Everyone had great customer service and generally positive attitudes.  I was very impressed and everyone was polite with great bedside manner.

3.5 stars but you get 4 instead of 3 until Yelp offers half stars!  This review is long overdue.    Ive been coming here off and on for 4-5 years.    CONS:   Beer glass/drink size: Im an IPA beer snob (this part of which will also be a pro, later on in the review) and it just bugs me that the beers are served in 12 oz glasses.  By not serving the beer in a pint glass, this is the message i get:  MOTO is trying to make just a little more profit off the beer by shorting you the extra four ounces you are accustomed to.    Case in point: Sculpin on draft (delicious), 12 oz for $7.  This is what I pay for Sculpin at places like Federal and Postino, unfortunately i do not think MOTO is the same caliber place (service, food, etc).  I expect a little more beer for my $7.  Food: Average.  Its like guilty pleasure / junk food with Asian flare.  Not the freshest, not the tastiest, but i keep coming back (when i feel like being bad), so it can't be all that bad!  And now for my biggest gripe, CLEANLINESS:  There are several decorative metal grates hanging from the ceiling over the bar and the area where sushi is prepared.  For the last year, I have noticed that these grates have an insane amount of dust bunnies and dirt on them.  Its SO gross.  On my last visit, the cook was preparing sushi at the bar and i couldn't help but think how many particles of dust and debris were falling from those grates onto the sushi.   PLEASE CLEAN THE GRATES!!   PROS:  Great beer selection, always rotating, and always updated on TapHunter!! Whomever manages the Facebook site is really on top of things and posts witty things.  Vibe! Its a good vibe.. the kind of place I want to pop into after hiking squaw peak.  Nothing too fancy, not pretentious at all, and just laid back. The ambience is nice and the menu is full of witty statements.  There is enough about this place that I like, and i will keep coming back.  I hope the owner reads this and finds the comments constructive and helpful.

I suppose you could just put me in the "box" with "Luis T" on 3.20.10...because if i didnt know any better, his could have been my entry.. So i was here this week.  Let me start by saying i have been giving Los Dos Molinos my  business for almost 20 years now, and each year that goes by i find myself saying that i am going to cease my patronage.  I will save the stories from the recent years and why i've been feeling this way, and give you just the specifics from my most recent visit:  If you want to make the rule that there are "No Split Checks" then can you AT THE VERY LEAST get with the current times and make the bill somewhat decipherable?  We had a large party, and were quite promptly advised there were no split checks, yet at the end of the night we were left with a ribbon of calculator tape with ONLY prices, and no correlation with actual menu items...so we had to cross reference the menu to figure out what the heck all the itemizations correlated to.   And by the end of it, we pretty much gave up and just guessed at what each person should contribute because the receipt may have just as well been in morse code.  Ok, im getting ahead of myself..Its one thing if you have subpar service and the restaurant is slammed, understaffed, there is a MLB baseball game or NBA basketball game, or concert going on...This was not the case.  We were the ONLY table inside the restaurant and the service absolutely sucked.  How many times must one flag down the server for (take your pick) A;  refill on chips B: refill on ice water and C:(most importantly since the drinks are marked up 300%) a FRESH DRINK!!! Oh yes and D: Check please.  We had to look over our shoulders for A , B, C, and D.  When our table collectively decided the service was ridiculous we decided the tip would reflect that, and then we realized an 18% gratuity was included...well no wonder.  When that is the case, there is NO incentive for decent service!! We brought several items to the attention of the bald headed caucasian man who may have been a manager of some sort but his severe lack of customer service skills merely resulted in him stating in a childish voice "They are complaining about the service" to an audience that didnt exist.  Damn right! and damn right we will take our business elsewhere.  Grandma Chavez is rolling in her grave! you should be ashamed!

I had the same dentist for over 20 years and decided to try someone new.  I had no idea just how outdated my old dentist's equipment was until i had something to compare it to.  The staff is awesome and the atmosphere relaxing.  Great customer care and service.  Highly recommended.

Stale vibe / decor , bland food ... Either this place is supes terrible or Clever Koi is seven stars on a five star scale. The "egg" was a stained brown color and the yoke was hard boiled , not soft. I actually thought there were sliced mushrooms in my ramen .. Alas, 'twas merely the rubbery brown sliced egg.

This review is long overdue.  I've been coming to the Garage for several years. This will stop. Walking distance to home and Sunday Ticket are no longer reason enough to return.  The food is average to slightly above average.  Same with the beers.  Being a hophead, I'm disappointed at the lack of the IPA tap rotation; its always Bells Two Hearted Ale.  I always seem to have the same two or three servers/bartenders.  The Hispanic guy with the gold chain and the neck tattoo ROCKS.  He is on top of his game and knows his stuff.  He's friendly and cracks jokes and is just fun to be around.  That's about the only good thing I can say about the service here.  The blonde male bartender musician who wear skinny jeans and has tattoos is cranky and acts like he is put out by the customer.  I have overheard him talk about how hungover he is/was, and I've also seen him more interested in playing grab ass with the other female employee and or dick around on his cell phone.  He does not work his bar well.  You have to constantly get his attention for service..he does not come to you.  I think his face would literally fall OFF if he were to smile.    The straw that broke the camel's back was the other night.  The place was dead.  There were two tables seated on the patio and no one at the bar, yet the service was abysmal.  To the point we never got a chance to order because well, we never had the opportunity/got so tired of waiting.  The drinks took long enough (same cranky bartender who couldn't be bothered), I can only imagine how long the food would have taken.  We left without ordering food.  Half of our group walked across the street to Z Tejas and the other half hit the Taco Bell drive through.  I saved their group text as a demonstration of just how bad the Garage was/has become. The online reviews don't allow for photo posting so here is what their text said: John:  We went to taco bell on the way home and the service was better than the Garage. Jill:  We went to taco bell and their service was great (plus two emojis of tacos).     If your employees don't want to be there, maybe they should be relieved of their duties and management should find someone who at least somewhat embraces the art of customer service and friendliness.

Romantasy Cabaret is a wild, entertaining adventure.  Not for the faint of heart or those easily offended.  Bring your humor, your open mind, and your appreciation of sexuality and artistry and embrace all that is ROMANTASY CABARET.  They pack a lot of punch into several hours of entertainment! Enjoy!

The food was amazing.  We were a party of three and we all absolutely loved the food.  The only reason i didnt give five stars is because the food took 30-35 minutes, and I noticed that was about the going wait for everyone.  The kitchen is very small (i know this, because you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom), so there is probably not a whole lot they can do about turnaround time.  Anyhoo, if you are patient and not on a time crunch during their busy times, its worth the wait.

This place is the bomb! Don't waste your time with mediocre food, bad service , and terrible music across the street at Taco Guild. You'll spend half the money and double your pleasure. I gave Taco Guild three tries, before giving up. Came to Gadzooks today for the first time , and was super impressed. Great concept . I'll definitely be back.

Also:  it is a little intimidating/overwhelming on your first visit.  I stared at the menu board for about 2 minutes and was still undecided and somewhat confused,and  thats when the gal behind the counter asked if i had ever been there before and proceeded to very patiently and thoroughly explain the process and the options...that was very helpful.  Granted, there was no one behind me in line (i got there right as they opened).  By the time i left, the place was packed and there was a long line, so others may not have had the opportunity for full explanation as did i.  Just something to keep in mind on your first visit; its kind of like a crash course in a new language.. but worth the effort!

3.5 Stars.. Pro:  Excellent beer selection.  Sunday Ticket.  Super friendly staff (they seem to actually like their job).  Con:  $7 for 10oz of beer is a little high.  The pizza was totally bland.  I ordered it with fresh mozzarella and roma tomatoes.  The dough was way too doughy/chewy/undercooked, there was NO flavor, and the tomatoes were whole, making it a bit tricky to try and eat with a fork and knife (I gave up on the utensils but the tomatoes were still rolling off the slice.) SLICE THOSE SUCKERS IN HALF!  This was my third time to the THT.  I will be back...but pizza could use improvement.

Great selection. Super friendly staff.  Im happy for the Slope but nervous that they cant possibly sell enough great craft beer to Slopers to keep the huge selection fresh.  My IPA was 8 months past the stamped date. my friend's wheat beer was two months beyond the "enjoy by" date.  If you arent a ridiculous beer snob like I am, then it wont be a problem.  Either way, the atmosphere and selection is definitely enough for me to go  back.  Prices are great, too.

This is a pretty cool concept and they have a decent IPA on tap (Bells Two Hearted).  The chairs are pretty uncomfortable and it feels like you are going to slide right off... Otherwise, no complaints!  PS the Bells 2 Hearted on  a Sunday at 4:50pm, was $5.

Great customer service, communication, and attention to detail.  They picked up every last bit of their debris/trash at the end of the project which was the icing on the cake and a lost art!

Absolutely terrible . I can't even rate the food because the service was so terrible that our large group walked out. First impressions are everything. The manager was also present and was more concerned about setting up an outdoor ping pong table in 105 degrees than getting drinks and seats to a large party that was standing around for 20min.

This was my first time here. I ordered the goat cheese salad and added salmon (to-go lunch). It came with a nice fresh warm piece of pita. This was hands-down the best Greek salad I've ever had. Everything was super fresh.  I will definitely be back.

The two stars are for service and the $5 happy hour drinks. Herriana was our server and she was excellent.  The food was subpar.  Scallops were terribly over seasoned...All that was left on the palate was excess of salty and super spicy.  $18 for three scallops... Then i see a review of the restaurant from December where a patron said he was served 4 scallops for $17...hmmmm. Feeling a little ripped off !  The portobello mushrooms were awful.  They were drenched (and I mean swimming) in a thick vinaigrette that was so overwhelming.  The bruschetta...was just ok.  It was a build your own tray of weirdness.     Ahi Tuna,  $15.. sliced much more thin that what Im used to and overcooked.  It was lacking something that I have yet to put my finger on and sliced so thin that you couldn't appreciate the usual differential of the seared outside to the uncooked inside.   The patatas bravas was probably the best tasting item we ordered, but visually looked like dog food.     I wish I had taken a photo of the items described. We wanted to like this place, we really did .  Unfortunately we won't be back.  There are just too many other places out there with way better food for that price point.  (5 tapas and $30 worth of happy hour cocktails = $130 after tip)

We had no idea when we walked in that it was their first official day open for business... They clearly are not suffering the same plight as so many other new bars and restaurants in town which take too long to work out the kinks. They are super dialed in and the customer service was over-the-top. Decor is nothing special it's actually kind of bland, but it really doesn't matter. The beers were fresh and crisp and the food is really tasty. The banana cornbread is amazing (although fairly greasy). The white bean purée appetizer with fry bread was super tasty and quite amazing, visually. We will definitely be back.
