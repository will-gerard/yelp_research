More of a tourist attraction.  Food is better elsewhere for the cost.

The "specials" are always the same.  However, we have never had a meal that we were disappointed with.  The waiter always forgets beverages that are non alcoholic, but he is on top of it when it comes to selling wine. I only know because I was pregnant and he would forget my drinks. Lamb shank is very good!

My favorite Mexican food on the valley.  Delicious chips and salsa, margaritas, and great food portions.  I have been coming here since 2000.

Always good service, portions of fish, and the pricing is great!!  The BYOB is nice too.  They refrigerate your drinks and bring them to you.  Can't beat that!

Seating service is always a little slow because they don't want to put too much pressure on the service staff.  So, sometimes you have to wait for no reason. Food is always good.  Nice breakfast spot for the weekends!  Good patio seating.

My husband and I enjoy going there on the weekends for breakfast.  We also take guests when they come to town because it's close to our house and you can get a homestyle breakfast for a decent price!  They have a wide variety of classic breakfast dishes; something for everyone.  This place is by no means fancy or upscale, it's just a mom and pop restaurant with great breakfast.  The servers are always friendly and the owners do a good job with seating people on the weekend when it's busy.

The Bagel Man has the best everything bagels I have ever eaten.  I go there for lunch a couple times a week.  I enjoy the Boar's Head deli meats as well.  Cal is there every day and always greets me with a smile and knows exactly what I like.  Glad to see that since it has only been open a few months that he always has customers in there.  I love to see the community supporting the small businesses in the area.
