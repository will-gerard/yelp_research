Not China Town, but more like China Oasis  This is the closest thing to a China Town in Phoenix.  There is not comparison to the ones in LA or NY, but there is a lot of character present.  I usually come here for Dim Sum at Golden Buddha and go to the L Ranch Supermarket, but it is small and quaint, but does give a fun representation of the Zen Chinese in the Koi Fish Pond and garden.  Don't expect LA or NY China Town, but not bad for the desert.   If you find this useful, funny or cool, please check below.

"Name brand clothing without the name brand price tag"  Although being male, My Sister's seems to be a big hit among the women in my family.  I am related to shopaholics and bargain hunters and though it seems that these may be part of a genetic predisposition to the Asian gene on both sides of the family, you would think that I spend my weekends on this expensive past time.  I don't.  But I do enjoy finding my bargain name brands here which are plenty at Well Suited (Male counterpart to My Sister's Closet).  By coming here, I not only save on $$, but save on time spent shopping all over malls and waiting for sales desired clothing.  They do have spectacular sales about twice a year on the consigned articles up to another 70% off (usually in late January and August).  This is to make room for new seasonal items.  While others may cringe at the thought of wearing consigned clothing, it is their loss due to the amazing savings.  I cannot speak on the consignment system as I have not brought in any of my clothing, but I can attest to the selection to buy which are great, clean, and organized; providing opportunity for us to wear name brand clothing without the name brand price.

Need help, make sure it is in the morning or have Ron answer your questions  I come here a lot being a home owner.  Most of the times I know what I'm about to get and there are other times I get the help I need.  Although I do notice that when I come in the morning or early part of an afternoon, service seems more available than in the evening.  I have a harder time finding help and it seems like this is the case in these home service stores and this maybe because everyone is trying to tidy up in the last hour and don't want to deal with a pesky patron doing late evening shopping.  However, when I do know and know what aisle to go to, I have no problem finding what I need at this location.  My only knock on home depot is help available in the evening.  I would hope their service is fresh and eager in the evening as it is in the morning.    The store is clean and organized and it seems I find someone always cleaning.  Ron from the lighting department was awesome.  He did answer a lot of questions regarding recessed lighting and even gave a very good tip regarding options with eco lighting options.  He didn't make me feel rushed or a burden and even was candid in telling me what he didn't know instead of making it up.    If you thought this was useful, cool or funny, please check below.

"I may not get $5000 gift card for this entry, but it is worth it"  I come here as often as Sunday morning service at church (meaning weekly).  And in some ways I feel this location is nearly as friendly.  Last time I came here, Jake helped me out with plumbing.  Sometimes the item is not obvious to where it is, but more often than not I have find some one with directions, an opinion, and a smile.  Although this occurs more so during the day than the evening hours.  Jake not only help me with the plumbing issue, but was able to cut the copper tubing I needed to get done.  This location is solid in service and what I also notice that there are a couple workers with disabilities that are just as capable and helpful as those without.  Kudos to this location for their diversity in their team.

Great selection and presentation of fireplaces with friendly services.  Services personnel are knowledgeable and offer good tips.  Definitely better to look for options for fireplace than Home Depot or Lowes.  They offer traditional wood burning, gas, electric, and ecosmart fireplaces (the ones often shown on HGTV).

Came in to check them out as recommended by a friend.  I ordered an egg muffin sandwich and apple fritter.  The sandwich was huge.  Too bad I didn't think of getting a picture until after I had eaten it.  It was better than I expected from a donut shop.  Service was friendly and it got very busy right after we ordered.  It seemed that a lot of people ordered the sandwich as well.  As I bit into the sandwich my mouth can feel the crunch of the english muffin filed with egg, sausage, strips of bacon, with melted cheese.  Apple fritter was good, but the sandwich was more memorable.  Service was excellent.  The only thing that could have made this a 5 star was the decor, but if you can see beyond the run down, out dated pictures, the food and service well make up for it.

You may need to invest in security camera for their service.    I used to be in support of Waste Management and the things they do in the community.  We have recycle bin and regular trash bin which is to be picked up same time every Tuesday.  However recycle bin is constantly being picked up late or not at all.  They claim that we have vehicles blocking the bins.  However, they do not realize that we have security cameras to show no pick up done and there is no vehicle blocking bin.  It is almost offensive that we have to justify by video that their trucks have not come and they do not take our word for it.  I feel bad for others who do not have the technology. Shame on you.

Not an oxymoron...Great service Vietnamese Restaurant  I've been here several times and it is about time I gave my review.  I'm from So. Cal so I grew up with very good Vietnamese food.  It is one of my favorite places to come to in the Valley because of the food, friendly service and all this for an affordable cost.  This is a true dive or hole in the wall for sure, but the food makes up for the lack in decor.  Besides the Pho, the Banh Xeo (Crepe) and rice dishes are very tasty as well.  You have to realize that the cost of gathering all the ingredients and cooking it yourself would usually be higher than coming to eat here for any meal.  And if you happen to see Banh Bao on the table in front, you have to try it.  They do not serve this daily which they should, but it is a white pastry filled with steamed barbeque pork and some hard boiled egg.  When you get it fresh, you'll thank me for tasting this hidden gem.  Hands down best in the valley and rivals those made in Little Saigon, California.   The ROA (Ratio of Authenticity) is usually 0.65-0.75. (# of Ethnic Patrons (Vietnamese in this case) / Total # of Patrons) at any given time which for me is pretty authentic for Phoenix.  I've been in other Vietnamese restaurants which were supposedly voted the best in the valley, but is horrible by VN standards.     I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the decor.

"Not Scottsdale Fashion Square or Biltmore Fashion Park, but not bad either"  I've been to this mall several times and though it is not a place I go leisurely strolling and window shopping, it does have a lot of basic needs.  Costco, Wal-mart, Target, Petsmart, movie theater and banks on the outside.  Though the decor can be more updated, the selection in shops is pretty good.  If you want to hang out or go window shopping, I know there are other malls that may be better, but for your basic shopping needs, this is not bad.

Not a supermarket, but super in many other ways.  It's hard to find something wrong with Trader Joe's at any location.  Staff are friendly, produce are fresh, and there is always something new to try out.  It is interesting to find a great assortment of orchids here at an affordable price along with your groceries.  It is ironic that over the years these stores don't get any bigger than the size of a Walgreens store.  They will never be a supermarket, but they are super in so many other ways.

"Imagine Black Friday every day"  Shopaholics be very careful when reading this review.  In the world of rejected, returned, and slightly irregular clothing comes a place where several ambitious name brand clothing are given their last stop before being cast into the abyss of donated clothing.  Last Chance brings new life to fashion that never made it to their destined owner by offering it at fraction of the retail cost. The catch is matching that orphaned clothing with their new owner.  Shopaholics will have to endure the separation anxiety as their article of clothing is in the hands of another owner.  You will have to overcome aggressive shopping from children and old ladies determined to fine their item.  The only limit is what is imposed by the shopping policy at the door and what is posted throughout the store.  You can see families strategizing before their purchase like watching another sequel of Ocean's 11.  You'll have to plan for a line even though this store is the size of any Ross store, there are 15 eager registers waiting to cash in your purchase.  I know clothing and fashion quality are popular and current as the shoppers demographic are similar to those at the Biltmore Fashion Park or Scottsdale Fashion Square.    As a shopping experience this is not for the faint of heart, but watching women putting their hunting skills into practice when shopping is only an experience you'll have to witness yourself.

Dim Sum and then some  Definitely one of the best Dim Sum in Phoenix if not the best.  Only served during lunch.  Not good for romantic date, because of the noise of shuffling carts of food throughout your meal, but usually occurs during lunch time Dim Sum.  Good selection of steam dumplings and pork buns to crunchy deep fried shrimp balls. Don't miss the shrimp rice noodle.  Service is pleasant and friendly.  Cost is reasonable.   Ambiance is nice.  There is a baby grand piano, but only played at night for dinner.  It is comparable to California standards.  Good ROA (ratio of authenticity) about 60-70%. (#Chinese Patrons/#total Patrons).

"Sizzling rice soup is the only thing that sizzles"  Went here for lunch with my wife and mother-in-law because we were in the mood for Chinese food.  Although it was our first time, it may be our last time as well.  I ordered the Kung Pao chicken which as filled with thick sauce which did blend the chicken and vegetable together, but more like made everything taste the same.  My wife had the eggplant chicken which I think tasted the same as the Kung Pao chicken as well.  Should have called it Kung Pao eggplant chicken.  The dinning room is similar to that of a lodge converted to restaurant.  I did order the sizzling rice soup which was good, but there wasn't enough soup as the rice soaked it all up.  Price was a little high for portion sizes I thought.  Although the owner was very nice and cordial that is the reason I gave this 2 stars.  There is very little authenticity to the restaurant as the ROA is a dismal 10%, ratio of authenticity is #of ethnic patrons/#total patrons.

"Unhappy Workers Leaves Dissatisfied Customers"   It is a big store that is open 24 hours in a part of town that has been known to be on the 10 o'clock news from time to time.  However, there is something going on in management that makes you feel like everyone is unhappy or unwilling to help.  It took me while to get some one to help me out to get a passport photo and they would not honor the online discount that I had written down the code on a piece of paper.  Other customers were waiting and even the workers were complaining in public that they are over worked.  Scary.    If you are here, make sure you don't need any help or discount getting it.  Just purchase and move on and don't expect anything more.    Check useful, funny, or cool if you think so.

"Procrastinator's Passport Paradise"  Before you book that out of country vacation, business, or mission trip, make sure you have your passport up to date.  That was problem number 1.  However, I found this Procrastinator's Passport Paradise, the answer to a common dilemma by many travelers, hidden resource in Tempe.  This place will save you from making the trek down to Tuscon (which is the only other place in all of AZ) if you need a 24-48 hour turn around on your passport renewal.  Search the web and you'll find out that there isn't any place else in Phoenix area.  While you do pay a premium for expedited services, it isn't outrageous.  I spent another $132 for a 1 week turnaround, which includes overnight postage to and from Washington DC (Government fees was $170).  Of course you'll pay less if you do not need the expedited service.    Despite the dodgy exterior and basic dated interior, this place has provided professional reliable service for at least 10 years.  This is the same place that is recommended by the lady that works at Passport Center at ASU Tempe Center, which was not able to provide any service faster than 14 business days.    They do provide three computers to fill out the electronic forms and even can take your necessary passport photos.  But of course this can be filled out ahead of time. Just click this link http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/first/first_830.html  If you find this funny, useful, or cool, please click accordingly.  Safe travels.

Bring your own twine before you buy.  I purchased a washer from this store and then purchased the matching pair from a different Sears Outlet in Phoenix on Cactus.  I did my research, knew where to go, and purchased it because it was 45% off retail price (it was the only one at this price in all of AZ).  Customer service when purchasing the appliance was satisfactory, however if you have them help you put it into your truck, the supervisor left me with a piece of twine of 6 feet long to hold down a washing machine that is about 400 lbs.  This is after I asked for this.  Twine was not offered.  It wasn't they were busy at all either.  And then when I asked if that was all the twine I was to get, Larry said that I would be okay traveling from Tempe to Phoenix with that twine.  What??!!!  I just spent $500 in your store on a washer and also paid extra for the maintenance and warranty and all that I could get was 6 feet of twine? (Twine is cheap)  Poor customer service.  Lack of concern and safety.  Never will I go back.  Sears Outlet in north Phoenix was more accommodating.  They are located on Cactus and 51 FWY.

Area 51 or Hwy 51  Freeway is better since the speed cameras have been taken out.  I agree that good to use city streets during rush our, but for the most part, this is a scenic and clean freeway.  Good access and it is the middle of Phoenix.  Weird to be reviewing a freeway.  I just made that up about Area 51, but if you think that there are weird things that happen in the mountains some where, there probably is.

Great pastry selection.  Clean.  Produce is okay in selection. Meat and seafood has good variety. If you want exotic foods, Lee Lee has bigger and better choices.  I go here because proximity.  You can buy "prepaid" dollars and you get 10% off at the counter, but it is not advertised. At least not in English.  I don't know why they call themselves "Super" L Ranch Market, when it is not all that big.    The Take-out Hong Kong Express is convenient too.

Medical assistance in a Bakery?  Great bakery service.  I've come here for meetings in the morning about 20 times.  Staff are friendly and you never feel rushed out even when you didn't order anything.  I was with a friend that had some medical problems and ended up on the ground.  Staff came around more than once to help out and to see what else they could do.  Food has always been good and consistent.

I've been here a few times because my friends keep wanting to go here for Sunday lunch.  But we are not sure we will be back.  Food is decent.  Chips and Salsa are good as well.  That is the only reason why I give this place 2 stars.  Now here are the reasons why it lacks.  Service is horrible.  We were the only people in the whole restaurant during Sunday lunch and the waiter made a BIG deal about us wanting to use three tables put together instead of two and even provided unwanted attitude as well.  He is also the same waiter that is unwilling to make separate checks as well even though we asked for this in the beginning during previous visits.  In my opinion, I think this was done so he can charge the mandatory gratuity.  Hello! Just because you have separate checks, doesn't mean you can't charge for this.  Service is not very accommodating.  Don't expect much when you go.

"Buyer beware"    They have to update their menu.  There are several items on menu they no longer serve and menus on items that are not even close to the picture.  When asked about why items are not given, waitress states that there customers are non-ethnic therefore food quality and taste is catered to that customer base.  (This translates to a less authentic menu and dining experience).  Experience becomes frustrating and waitress response was very defensive which made for awkward moment.  There's potential, but there are also better Vietnamese restaurants.    Doesn't any one feel that they have the most uncomfortable chairs?    I agree with Jeff Y, but I'd rather go to Da Vang instead.    (Like this review if you agree)

Skip the chicken bowl and get the Yakisoba with teriyaki chicken.   A solid 4 stars. The irony of a Vietnamese owner selling Japanese food.  Chicken was moist and tender served with a generous helping of noodles. Service is friendly and they make you feel welcome.  Unfortunately the business closed down.  RIP.

Two Words. Banh Bao  Beyond the beat down appearance and rough exterior lies an Asian grocery store that can satisfy your basic needs for Asian cooking.  The owners are great and very friendly and you can count on good suggestions and even a little cultural history on Vietnamese cuisine.  Aside from the groceries that are present with your can goods, spices, fresh Asian vegetables, and your selection of meats and seafood, what should draw you in is the small display of cooked and prepared foods in the back.  When ready and fresh are delicious and convenient to buy and take home to eat for dinner which will save you the time to prepare these Vietnamese dishes.  For me the hidden gem of Phoenix and Arizona is there Banh Bao.  This is a steamed Asian pastry filled with barbeque and steam pork with quarter of a hard boiled egg.  When eaten fresh out of the oven, the ingredients melt in your mouth combining the sweetness of the dough mixed with the savoriness of the pork meat.  I only wish this was made daily.

Car Wash...monsoon...Car wash again...  The exterior wash is decent.  I have the  unlimited washes which is useful during monsoon season.  Only $10/month.  There was even one day I went twice because of the monsoon.  Good vacuums and area is clean.  Not quite as busy with overpriced stuff to sell while you wait in lobby, but there is a lot of room for potential.  For hand drying, I once took my truck and service was okay.  But since it is close to home and there isn't a lot of wait and no one selling you windshield repair, this is a solid 4 stars.    Suggestions for the management. Wifi while you wait wouldn't be a bad idea.  Also family pack or unlimited washes for family's with more than one car would also be nice.

"Missing Owner as well as Missing Soap"    If you don't know, "The Carwasher" is under new ownership and they are called "Qwik and Clean."  However since the previous owner had his business taken away by the bank as the bank was running the business, things have not been the same.  Please see my previous 4 star review, but since new ownership has taken over, I guess soap the crucial main ingredient for a car wash was missing also.   Since I've washed my car, it has not been as clean and it seems like only water is being sprayed without any soap.    I've had my car washed 3 times since new ownership and it was because I had bought a card for 10 carwashes for $25.  However I still had 5 left. I just found out today according to new ownership, they do not honor it.  Wow!  Without any warning.  The guy working there said they are no longer "The Carwasher" because they are "Qwik and Clean."  Despite the big sign outside stating "The Carwasher" and their receipt stating "The Carwasher" we are supposed to automatically know they are "Qwik and Clean?"

More than church, its family.  Biblically sound and effectively delivered inspired messages from Pastor Terry.  But what makes this a great church are the people who care and are warm.  There are currently two campuses, one in Scottsdale and the other in Mesa with several services on Sunday and one Saturday night in Mesa.  The service is dynamic and worship uplifting.  You always leave better than you came.

Money doesn't grow on trees, but Dollar tree grows on saving.  Although one may be embarrassed to go into a discount store, you'll miss out on some very cool items or only a dollar.  Things that you would normally buy at Walmart or Target, you can get it here for a fraction of the price.  In this economy, quality dollar items are hard to find, but at least here you'll find something that may surprise you and stretch out your budget.    Staff are friendly and place is clean. Also the company seems to do a lot of community projects as well which is pleasantly surprising for a discount store.

The Lanza Crew were and are spectacular.  I had six estimates from other AV engineers and companies in the valley and Lanza's quote ranked 3rd of all my quotes.  We are not a sports bar, but we had a big project for our clinic.  Lanza helped install 20 LED screens, 7 ceiling speakers from a different sound source, and 12 CCTV security system  so their bid was reasonable.  Never get the highest or cheapest bid especially for this sort of work including security system.    No one is perfect however what gave Lanza 5 stars was their dedication to customer service.  They accommodated our schedules and listened to our concerns and addressed them in a timely manner.  Scott even gave some cost saving measures as well as things that will help me upgrade when I need to in the future.  What also sets Lanza apart from other companies is their passion to provide the state-of-the-art home theater, security, and sound system without the cost that others require a stimulus package to afford.   When my patients are always entertained and satisfied despite the occasional long wait, this equals good business.  When my staff is feels safe that we have security system to protect them and their belongings, this equals good business.  Choosing Lanza became a great business decision.

"Stay away...because I want this theater all to myself"  Friendly customer service. And concessions are reasonable.  Great place to avoid the crowd.  Seats are comfortable.

"What? You're the Owner?"  I have to agree with Brendan K. and Jason F.'s experience.  And if you want anything done, please don't talk to the owner who is Mr. Tanner.  We had granite counter tops.  Upon delivery, we notice a crack near sink opening.  They had told us this was a "fissure."  After 1 week of discussion, we took their word for it and they counter tops would be delivered and the "fissure" would be epoxied and sealed and not to worry again.  Upon installation, the granite cracked at the same place they had told us was a "fissure."  We had to fabricate another slab, but that also broke and we had to select a different granite countertop all together.    Greg- in sales seems genuine and wants to make things right, but talking to the person who answers 90% of the calls (Mr. Tanner who is the owner) is like talking into a black hole.  You can call and leave a message which 30% of the time will be returned or message given, but a simple solution as hire a receptionist to take your messages would be more wise than allowing the owner who may have memory problems take the calls.  He will tell you that he has taken "700 calls this morning" and therefore it is impossible for him to deliver your message to the appropriate people or return your calls or remember anything which he told you over the phone or in person.  If you want to avoid frustration, then don't come here.    The owner then stated that if he had "given the countertop for free, your wife would still not be satisfied."  I say try me.      If you find this useful, cool, or funny, please check accordingly.

Patience is a virtue. If you don't have any then come here.  I've purchased a dishwasher, oven stove, dryer, and Blue tooth keyboard from here.  For the major items I did my research on consumer reports and looked online and shopped at the regular Sears store before purchasing.  I did save minimum of 40% off MSRP of Kenmore Elite appliances here.  No problems yet for the past 2 years.  I just got my LG dryer here which works great.  I had to get the washer at another Sears outlet, but wish I was able to get them both here (the other Sears Outlet had poor service).  Interestingly being from the same company name, they are competitors.  Although it seems like there is a high turnover of workers here, what is consistent is the sale items.     I would recommend coming here and try to negotiate further, but before you do, please do your home and research because especially when you need a washer and dryer, it seems that all the sears outlets carry a lot of dryers and not the matching washer, but if you are patient you can find the matching pair here or another store.    They are good with helping you load your purchase and securing it to your vehicle.

Interesting, but unauthentic.  I was looking forward to coming here.  I have become a foodie. My wife and I love to try new places and support local restaurants.  Rice Paper was on my list of places to try.  The place looks like a converted residential home turned restaurant.  The place was clean and trendy.  Service was great and friendly.  The server even brought our dogs some water to drink out side.  However the food didn't fulfill my expectations for a truly Vietnamese meal experience.  There was a lacking of authentic flavor in our dishes.  I believe the Pho was lacking in taste and substance as the meal was very humble and seems shy in the true taste of Pho.  "Enlighten me" spring roll was interesting as well.  I did like the crunch from the fried wonton skins in the roll however the jalapeno was a bit overpowering for me.  Salads were forgettable too.   Ratio of authenticity (ROA)  #Ethnic Patrons/Total # Patrons 0.1 (includes my party).  Although not very authentic in Vietnamese cuisine, it did show potential in some of their originality in their spring rolls.   Price was high as it is rare to have the price of pho at a whopping $10.    There are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurants which is worth the experience at half the cost.  (You may have to put up with poor service, but at least your stomach will be satisfied.)  If you find this review funny, cool or useful please check below.

"American Breakfast Staple Done Right"  Skillet corned beef hash is delicious.  Belgium waffles cooked with perfect combination of crispy outside with moist center topped off with there signature "Butters" syrup.  It is clear why there is always a long wait on weekends.  Our waitress very cordial and aware of her table and cleanliness of the table.  There was little spillage from our orange juice and she quickly alerted another wait staff to help clean our table.  She came to check on us twice.  (Once is considered standard).  The decor is Clean and modern and impressive.  On a first impression Butters delivers a strong showing on what is basic of American breakfast staple.  I would have to go again to check on consistency.

"Skip the Pho and try Mi Quang"  Great first impression. This seems to be under new ownership and had remodeling.  There specials are Mi Quang and Bun Bo hue.  The Mi Quang (see picture) is pleasant delight mixed with large yellow rice noodles, fresh vegetables, shrimp, chicken, and hard boiled quail eggs.  The soup is savory with a hint of chili spice and when eaten together with rice chip it has a terrific compliment of taste and texture which leaves you with a smile of goodness.  Since the other Vietnamese restaurants don't make this dish, this is easily a hidden gem and probably best in Phoenix if not AZ.  Facilities are clean and service is friendly.   The wait staff came over once to fill our water glasses and once to ask how was our meals. (Easily should be done since we were the only ones present).  It is easily seen that this is family owned as most Vietnamese establishments as kids are running and playing throughout the restaurant.  Not sure about ROA (ratio of authenticity) because we were the only ones there on a Sunday brunch.  Well have to be back.  Cost is a little more than you would find at Da Vang or Pho thanh.

4 stars for ambiance and decor.  (you would never have guessed this from the store front. 5 stars for food. Some Thai restaurants load up on sugar and chilli. Pete's doesn't and portion sizes are more than generous. 5 stars for value. (this would be a 6 if possible) 5 stars for service. Robert is very friendly and has good recommendations. ROA - ratio of authenticity (#ethnic patrons/#total patrons) = 40%. This is after three separate visits.   Won't be disappointed.  Diamond in the Rough.

Absolutely unprofessional. Had an extended warranty on our dishwasher and sears referred this company to come out. Not only wasted our time, but didn't even want to touch the dishwasher because he couldn't find the model number. As we were in the process of calling sears, he said he can't do anything and just walked out leaving us hanging. Classless and unprofessional. I would have gone some place else except this was under warranty.  Says a lot about who Sears chooses to work with.

Horrible location, but well worth it.  Service here is friendly and there are a great many selections for hallmark cards and other hallmark items.  I do like the convenience of the post office inside which is better than the one on Greenway. It is in a horrible location and in corner and behind the Yogurt Mart but there are enough people in the neighborhood to use this location.  It seems pretty busy during the day.  I agree with Tasia T.  Great customer service.  Good selection on cards.  Don't go to the Walgreens for cards, because their selection seems to be limited to people who do not like to read.

Fun, Clean, and Free  Great facilities. Our church uses this once a year for annual sporting fellowship get together.  Has basketball, softball, and sand volleyball pits.  Clean.  They do have restrooms and water fountains.  Dog park next door.

My dog peed on their carpet...  And they were completely calm and professional about it.  I came in to refinance my house and had great friendly service even for a huge banking institution.  They even had doggy treats as well.    Ultimately there is nothing they had to offer for homes for refinancing, but they were very friendly.    The building has a very interesting modern look which is not typical of a banking institution.

"WOW, GAG, Tacos, Fun, and Intern Jenny"  Though I do agree with S G. that more shaded tables would have helped, it was a blessing that the weather wasn't 115 degrees for an AZ food festival.  After a $12 entrance fee (Living Social had a deal for $6),  $2 provided you a ticket.  Each ticket gave you one taco at any of the approximately 25 venues serving tacos.  There was a deal for beer too.  Granted not all venues were serving tacos, the vast majority did.  Although I wished there was a road map of where all the venues were located, none the less it wasn't too much to go around the whole park to find what you wanted.  This would have helped narrow your choices though.  There was a contest for best taco as well.  Choices varied from beef, pork, chicken, seafood, and other (Vegetarian and Duck from our experience).  There were tacos that made you go WOW to those that made you go GAG.     Overall the experience was fun, tacos were great, and even got to meet Intern Jenny for a "high-five" at the Yelp Booth too.  There were several popular jumper inflatables for the kids to enjoy.   Please check if you found this useful, fun, or cool.

"Snoh way anything frozen can taste this good!"    Selfishly I don't want to recommend this place because of the possibility of making this so popular that I worry that there wouldn't be enough supply for my demand.  However my rating would suffice in this easy recommendation.  One of the easiest description to this would be frozen cotton candy.  The uncanny fluffiness to this desert marvel topped with fruit toppings and condensed milk is a taste you'll be back for more. This is simply a no-brainer during 115 degree weather, but the shaved ice is a treat you worth having even during cold days of Arizona.  Though I haven't tried the Snoh drinks, I would give it a try at my next stop.    Service is friendly and they make good recommendations.  The place with it's trendy decor, Instagram artwork and Flat screen TVs adds to your visual stimulation as you wait for your desert.  I would opt for the large size in a dish with split flavors with original and something you're willing to try.    My only hope is that my fantastic review doesn't get lost in the "filtered" black hole of reviews for the site.  If you find this useful, funny, or cool please check accordingly.
