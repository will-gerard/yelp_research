I wouldn't allow these people near my animals! They mise-diagnosed two of my dogs...sent one home with a intestinal blockage that would have killed him if I didn't take him somewhere else! All of my animals go to Palm Valley, love Dr Hatch!!

It seems like when this place gets a sick animal the first thing they do is push you off on someone else, they can't be bothered.  My Black Lab was mis diagnoised with thyroid cancer, they said it was a fat mass and wouldn't biopsy it, my yellow Lab swallowed something that got stuck in his intestines, they took blood work and said they would call in the morning.....I ran him right out to Cave Creek for an ultrasound, we were sent to a hospital a block away and took him in for emergency surgery, he would not have survived the night.  I believe if you dog needs only shots, your probably safe, anything else...run, run far away.  They don't care about your animals.  There are so many caring and outstanding vets who truly care about animals, get away from these people!!!

Run for your life!!!  I needed to have so much stuff done to my bike when I had it towed in, needless to say they screwed it up so bad I have to have it towed elsewhere.  They have no idea what their doing.  The gas tank rusted so they took care of that, but only removed part of the rust.  The cleaned my carb....not, the carb was never touch...but I paid for all the service they refused to correct, and they paid triple the $$$ to get it drive able.  I bought my bike from them and have been treated like shit since.  Give your business to someone you can return to, stay clear of these clowns,,,fat momma with the food stained shit might come out and yell at ya....if she can put the fork down.

Very fast service, and no issues getting scripts filled. Although even after having a medication approved by the insurance company, they chose to charge me $80, because they wouldn't honor the prior authorization, so I still go to Walgreens to make sure I'm not getting taking advantage of. But I much prefer the small town personable pharmacy.

Pet club had outstanding customer service, and just about every dog food you can imagine (except for the cheap crap). They are quite a bit lower than Petco and Petsmart, and if they don't have something in stock, they will order it. The staff go above and beyond, I'm happy they are so close to home!!

I don't know how to use this YELP, and I usually have someone else make complaints for me if I feel one is deserved, but a person took a frustrated email and decided to post it against David Gerard Salon. I wasn't aware of this until tonight, and it tore my heart out. I have so much respect for David and his stylist, especially Naomi.  Just because there was miscommunication, doesn't mean someone gets slammed online!!! This salon ( without exaggeration) is the best in the valley. I am really bothered by this, it shouldn't have happened!! I would like to apologize to each and every staff member, and David for a post that did not belong on the Internet!!!  You all are amazing, and if you want me to go outside and spin signs for a weekend I would be happy too!!!!

Stay far away from this place, they can't color or cut hair, cost me 200. To fix what they screwed up. They have no idea what they are doing, my hair was falling out by the handful after it was fixed, they messed me up big time!!

I went to the Indian School location, the blacked out windows should've told me not to go in. When I went in, the lobby was about 6 x 12 area with a couple cheap chairs, and an Asian guy sitting there with a note pad, and a lap top. He said your husband called and cancelled you appointment, I said "that's interesting, because I don't have a husband, so you have me confused with someone else". He just argued with me, so I walked out. The little area I saw was filthy, the floors and walls were disgusting, I can't imagine what was on the other side of the door, but I'm glad I didn't find out. I really have to question if this place is legit. It was downright disgusting. I'll stick with Blu Sol, and Hand and Stone, no happy endings there!!! Since writing this review, they have changed their rebuttal numerous times, there are numerous complaints on here, not sure why they are so focused on mine. I did not judge their race, as they have claimed in every rebuttal, I respect everyone that respects me. I don't understand why he keeps complaining about my language, I've never used inappropriate language towards them, or anyone else. I'm reading reviews here where people are saying they were tickled, not massaged; which massage schools teach students to tickle and giggle while attempting to give a deep tissue massage? I was thanking God as I walked out the door that my appt was canceled. If some girl started tickling me inappropriately during a massage, there would me more than a yelp complaint.
