Looooove this place.  I have to come here every time I visit Phoenix.  The rice with raisins and almonds, the baba ganoush, the hummus, the dolma, the falafel, the veggie patties... it's all so delicious and vegetarian-friendly (although they have plenty of meat options for the carnivores). The portions are HUGE, so come hungry, share, and/or make room in your fridge for leftovers.  Eden's Grill is staffed by a super nice family, and even though I'm not a regular, I feel like one whenever I go.

Payless?  I think that name is short for "Pay MORE for Less."  This was the worst car rental experience of my entire life.  I suppose the irate customer complaining of being overcharged and the staff members at another rental company's adjacent desk joking about ongoing issues with "Rent-A-Wreck" (aka Payless) should have been red flags.  But we had already made a reservation and thought we were getting a deal.  Oh, how wrong we were.  First of all, the price quoted to us magically increased by over 50%.  Turns out the "deal" we thought we were getting when we made the reservation was not a deal at all.  We would have paid at least $100 less going with one of the more well-known rental companies like Enterprise.  Secondly, upon arriving at our extremely expensive rental, we discover that this place truly is "Rent-A-Wreck."  The entire driver's side of the car was banged in and part of the fender was coming off.  The inside was stained, there were old french fries in the cup holder, and the steering wheel column was cracked. Seriously?  We're paying good money to drive this piece of junk?  Then the very next evening we get in the car and it won't start.  We try jumping it, to no avail.  I call and call and finally get someone on the phone.  They offer to send someone to "give us a ride."  I inform them we need a working car, not just a ride.  At this point we are nearly an hour late for dinner with friends, so I tell them we'll call back first thing in the morning - at which point they inform me that I cannot "abandon the vehicle."  I tell them the vehicle is perfectly safe and put the mister on the phone with them to figure out what we can do in the morning.  The manager says we can call them first thing in the morning and they will bring us a new car and try to jump the old one.  No mention of this costing us anything.  Morning comes, and we get dropped off at the car and we call.  And call. And call.  Finally, someone answers and says a manager will call us back in a minute.  40 minutes go by and no one has called, so we call back.  We get transferred to someone else.  Again we are promised that a manger will call us.  Another 30 minutes go by without a call.  We call back.  Yet again we are promised a call will be coming shortly.  I ask to speak with a manager but they won't transfer me, they just assure me I will receive a call.  20 minutes later we get a call saying that someone is coming and they are "just down the street".    Well, 45 minutes later, Todd the Manager finally shows up with a car and a truck.  The truck jumps the old car (it starts - apparently the battery will only start if you try jumping it with a large engine, which we didn't have access to), and they give us a new car to drive.  Todd tells us we have to sign a piece of paper agreeing to additional charges for the jump.  We refuse to sign, explaining that it's not our fault the car's battery is dead, we've already spent 18 hours without it, and we've been waiting outside for 2 hours for them to show up.  If anything, they owe US money.  Todd says he agrees and that we won't be charged the additional jump fee.  When we return the car, we are informed that we will be charged $79 in additional fees.  We tell the staff that Todd had assured us we would not be charged, and we did not sign anything agreeing to the additional charges.  The Payless staff sends us upstairs to speak with another manager, Kim.  Kim comes out and, without greeting us or asking any questions, immediately says that we were informed of the charges.  We tell her that actually, Todd agreed that we should not be charged additional fees, and we never signed the paper saying we agreed to the charge.  We waited for over 2 hours for any type of assistance, and it is not our fault that their car doesn't work.  Then she points her finger in our face and yells, "YOU are responsible for these charges and you were informed of this. The car is running just fine now, you probably left the lights on.  This is YOUR responsibility and we are charging your card for this."    Um, wow.  Now, I am a polite and reasonable person, and this extends to my role as a customer.  I have never, ever been treated like this by a manager.  Forget trying to have any rational discussion with this lady.  I realized any further conversation was pointless, and was not going to stand there and be yelled at with a finger wagging in my face.  So I grabbed the mister's hand and we left.  On our way out, a customer waiting in line looked at me in shock and said, "Someone needs to report her."  Yes, someone does need to report her.  And the entire company, because they rent out junk cars, overcharge customers for them, and have horrendous customer service.  So we'll continue trying to resolve this, and in the meantime, warn folks about Payless.

Update to my Payless Car Rental ordeal:  I have written the company twice, it has been over a month, and I have not heard back - not even a standard, automatic email.  We disputed the extra charges, our credit card company investigated the matter, and Payless could not prove that we should be held responsible for the charges.  So at least we've recouped $79, thanks to our own efforts and those of our credit card company.  No thanks to Payless.
