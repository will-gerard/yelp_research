What  I like about 101.5 is the music they play... yea yea it's the repetitive top 40 where you eventually start hating the top 5 songs coz you've heard like 10 times each on different stations... ok... woah... i digress! I like the radio djs. Snake is on... and I still remember him from 104.7 and Gringo Suave is not that bad either although I hardly listen to morning radio. But it just reminds me of the old 104.7FM before KISS took over. And that's why I like it, it brings back memories and I just like the station! That is all... end relay.

Sometimes during the day you get a hankering for some breakfast food... no not cereal, or a fruit cup with some yogurt, or a pop tart, sheesh not that! But, some yummy medium fried eggs or scrambled, with sizzling bacon, or links, and pancakes...... mmmmmmmmmmmm! And you think, where o where can I grab some goodness? So you think the usual suspects, IHOP, eh, 5&Diner, possibly, Denny's, ummm no, Village Inn, yuck. And then you think of that breakfast place you went to for hangover brunch, and you're like, no i want cheap food... so you keep on thinking until you lose interest and that hankering goes away which is kinda good if you're on a diet but heck it's breakfast food so it's good for you even when you have brinner! Well... my phoenicians there's a place that can satisfy those cravings, good diner food, friendly service, and cheap ass places and this mythical place is known as Jerry's Restaurant (since 1966) and it's 24 hours! See ya gay 5 & diner at 16th st, and Jenny's (drag queen denny's) on 7th ave, and hello butch Jerry's!   Recommended items - the Fried Chicken! the Big Bertha's Country Fried Steak and Eggs, the hungry traveler ( unlimited pancakes, 3 eggs, 6 bacon or links all for $7.99), and the of all things yum and gooey... their cinnamon roll with whipped butter... uh yea it's on my list of food items that i want on my table before the world ends in 2012.   Yea it's a geriatric central but you gotta love old people and old ladies that are servers who all have some attitude and sweetness altho the gay server has total cattyness... rowr... this gay boy wasn't gonna have it tho... if you're a bitch to me i'm a bitch to you... easy as that!  I love the setting, and the location.

let's get this out there, more of a disclaimer. I may be a guy BUT i'm not of the straight persuasion, so, my experiences are based on how I felt at the time.  I've been to Bourbon twice, both times with a friend, a straight girl who has a thing for the ladies. Yea, it's dimly lit, um, no, it's dark. There's a $5 cover, and they serve free popcorn (which i gotta admit is kinda good). My first time at Bourbon, I didn't really involve myself, I sat there like a creeper, staring, not because I was turned on but more like I was taking in the experience.   My most recent visit though I decided I was gonna have fun, so, I decided to base my tipping on how the girls looked (for example if they had killer stripper shoes, nice lingerie, killer pole dancing moves, etc.). It was fun, and it was nice to small talk with the girls. They're all professionals, some are great with their moves, others are lackluster but they are all enthusiastic. I did appreciate that a majority of the girls I saw dance did not have fake cleavage. We stayed until last call, my friend got one of the girls to bring her back to the "office" for a dance, from what I heard it was $$ well spent. Will I go back? yea, it's fun, I just got to be in the mood for it. Sadly, I felt a little discriminated at times because some girls would ignore my tips, apparently they knew I'd be a waste, oh well. lol.

lettuce wraps! their version is so on point that PF Chang's has nothing on them. the filling, the lettuce, and the sauce is so on point! It's so good that I can just feast on the 8-9 wraps served on the platter and not even bother ordering anything else. Oh and their hot tea is super flavorful. bravo Desert Jade for keeping it good! :)

in a non descript school house at a Quaker Church compound that's it's so easy to miss it unless you know of the place. Parking's tight with both private lot and a neighborhood street available. Walking in, it's not much coffee house but you definitely can see it's a quaint, cute music venue that's cozy. It's got character, and very indie that I totally love it, and look forward to coming back to in the future. =)

As a Phoenician I sometimes forget that we're lucky to have nature trails in the midst of the urban sprawl of this desert city. We may not have a memorable downtown skyline but something Phoenix does have a lot of are mountains that serve as a backdrop of gorgeous scenery. We are blessed to have many mountains with trails in each "park" like North Mountain, the Mcdowell's, the Estrella's, Camelback, and the Grand Dame of Phoenix, South Mountain. This range or urban park which is considered the world's largest serves as a visual landmark to many. During the day, coming from downtown and head down Central Ave, South Mountain towers majestically over this metropolis and at night, the glimmering red lights of the tv/radio towers that sit at its summit just sparkle. It provides direction, and this natural backdrop can also lay claim to being a memorable Phoenix landmark. But apart from its visual beauty this urban park provides an active recreation outlet to residents of metro Phoenix for it has many different trailheads at various points from Ahwatukee to Laveen. I liken South Mountain to be like Runyon Canyon in Hollywood, but here we have far more trails and it ranges from the easy to the difficult. And like Runyon Canyon you can drive up South Mountain and look below and see the grand expanse of sprawl glowing under the night sky and just take it all in. Yes, we are lucky to have this, literally in our backyard.

Back when I was an undergrad at Arizona State, I took some classes at MCC as to avoid further blemishing my school record at ASU. I had this perception as many others have had that taking certain courses at a junior college level would be somewhat easier than that of a university, namely math and science type courses. I was clearly mistaken and earned a new respect for math courses taught at MCC.   One fall semester apart from my 15 credits at ASU, I also took two additional courses at MCC, a Calculus I class and a technical writing course. I was blessed to be in a Calc. I course taught by a Prof. Santini who began the class with... "are you guys ready to get on the Santini roller coaster of fun?!?" upon hearing that I knew it would be an interesting semester. To say the least, it was more than interesting, although I barely passed, this guy knew his calculus, he had the passion and he instilled his teaching in that he wanted his students to understand the foundation of calculus, so, for him the basic formulas were meant to be second nature to us. His class wasn't easy, it was one of the most difficult undergrad courses I've taken but at the same time it was the most rewarding. The same went for my technical writing course in which my professor graded our papers to the nth degree. I have to admit that MCC has instructors that are great in what they teach and prepare their students to be competitive at the university level, well, that was my experience.  I do admit that this is one of the more crowded and busy junior colleges since it serves as a feeder school to Arizona State plus many of its students, like myself were concurrently enrolled at ASU and MCC. Another lesson learned from MCC was my parking skills. I learned how to be hawkish looking for parking. Since my classes were mainly on the side of campus facing dobson rd, my parking options were limited especially since from mcc i only had 45 mins to drive to ASU, look for parking there and get to class. Even now when I have to go to MCC for something, I still get frustrated looking for parking.   Overall, MCC offers quality courses taught by pretty good instructors, and I recommend supplementing your schedule by taking courses at MCC if you're already at ASU because whatever your final grade is at MCC you can transfer the grade for credit towards your degree without hurting your cumalitive gpa at ASU.

Oh AMC grand you sure have lost your lustre. At one time you were the best on par with Harkins and somewhere between the early 00s to now you're not exactly pageant queen material, more of the festival/parade queen. Your stadium seating although relevant is not as comfortable as Harkins. Wish you were the camelback esplanade coz that's the grand dame.

I'm a fan of NYPD coz i think they have really good pizzas. I have a NY bias and altho there's very few places that are able to come up with a true NY style pizza, NYPD is close enough. There are four pizzas that I order at NYPD and they are: Pizza Blanca, Da Works, Joey's Favorite and Cheese. I love their Pizza Blanca which is made with Olive oil, crushed garlic, ricotta, mozzarella with your choice of spinach or Roma tomatoes. *yum* I've always liked it with spinach but I have to admit it's exceptional with the tomatoes!! Da Works is their version of supreme, and their Cheese reminds me of pizza by the slice at any pizza place in Queens but not as good as the cheese at this pizza joint my family frequents in Whitestone, NY.   Their strengths are their pizzas. AVOID the calamari, it's yuck and if you've never had calamari this should not be the place to try it... it's GROSS! Their lasagna is not half bad, and their wings are good. Overall, this is one of my go to places if I'm craving pizza or buying takeout. It's true NYPD it's your pizza I trust!

Oh Los Faves, you sure know how to make a great breakfast burrito. What I love about Los Faves is that their burritos are not greasy, and they offer them with either flour or whole wheat tortilla. I'm boring with my order and usually get a sausage burrito, and sometimes a quesadilla. Their quesadilla is made with American cheese and not with queso blanco. On weekend mornings, expect a long wait with orders (around 15-20 minutes) since they get really busy. It's a good place to get a nice warm burrito and do yourself a favor and ask for the salsa verde, it gives the right kick to deliciousness!

This is one of my regular Vietnamese spots for two things, and they are:  fried rice (not on the menu)  &   chicken curry noodle soup  Their fried rice is OH SO GOOD and greasy, reminds me of Chinatown fried rice in the Philippines and in Malaysia, the ones you get from the hawker stand. MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmm!   Make sure you get the house fried rice because it so good, with the fried egg, the scallions, shrimp, pork, and chinese sausage. It's that good that I can always look past the dirty Vietnamese label that Saigon Pho usually gets from Vietnamese friends.   and, the Chicken Curry noodle soup with the rice noodle, the richness of the coconut and the thickness of the curry gravy mixed in with the rice noodle and the chunks of chicken, with a little spice, mmmm that's good eating. Oh and if you're eating in, get yourself their fresh lemonade, it's cool and really tart!!! love it. and these two menu items alone have made me a repeat customer of Saigon Pho the last 4 yrs.

Pita Jungle = wholesome love.  I'm a big fan and lover of Pita Jungle and have frequented the original Tempe location numerous times ever since hs back in 98 and have enjoyed many chicken shwarmas and hummus plates BUT the Chandler location rocks! I just love their space in the Anderson Springs Plaza, it's airy, love the art, the lighting, the staff and the overall feel. Atmosphere aside, like the Pita in tempe and the Jungle in Mesa at Dobson and Southern, the food is just awesome. I believe this is the location that I fell in love with my all time favorite item on the menu and that is the chicken pasta salad, a concoction of Marinated grilled chicken breast tossed with rotini pasta, fresh tomatoes, with lemon vinaigrette. Eversince first bite, I have been enamored by this simple pasta salad, the lemon vinaigrette is simply delicious intermixed with the pasta, I usually ask for extra tomatoes coz i love my lycopene. And I tend to order it often, I must remind you all that I'm not a fan of the norm but this dish does it to me. Anywho, tonight, I tried something new, after being reassured by my friend Dani that it's alright to live life on the edge, so, i got myself the Philly Steak Pita. YUM, liked it not loved it but I'll order it again in the future. BUT i still love my chicken pasta salad.

This is my go to B&N. I'm an avid reader that and have grown from having a library card to being a B&N card carrier. What I love about B&N over Border's is that I always go for the discount stacks. They're like a book buyer's heaven. It's a jamboree of different books from self help, to self love, fiction to non-fiction, biographies to ghost stories, personal narratives to self reflection. I love the deeply discounted prices and the extensive selection.   I've never experienced bad customer service at any B&N although most times I hardly need assistance since I enjoy checking out the different books on the shelves, and take time to read a few pages or sit down on the many chairs and couches available in the various alcoves of the store. I'm not a big starbucks fan but I do enjoy that Starbucks has a partnership with B&N so that in many of their stores, you can enjoy a hot/cold beverage, enjoy a snack and read a book. It's perfect and offers a good respite from everyday life as well as a great alternative to doing something else other than staying in on the weekends. Hence I do enjoy B&N and maybe I'll see you there.

This is what a corporate Sprint store should be like. Never assume the worse of your customers, and try not to short change them when something's wrong with their phone and expect them to pay the replacement fee. Here the reps at the Sprint franchise location, the staff realize that alot of phones are not constructed that great and can act up at times. They WORK with the customer and provide options. And, when they can't come up with a solution and need to replace the phone, they blame it on the manufacturer, and waive the $100 replacement. This alone is reason why I'll come back because they provide true customer service and made sure I got 100% satisfaction with my experience there.  After learning as a franchise store that they're able to offer discounts on accessories since they have no corporate ties and cannot handle billing, this makes even more willing to come back. Plus, it's closer to where I live! now about those store hours, yea, they close early at like 6:30p. oh fudge!

One Pie sums up my four star experience and that is JD pecan pie! All other pecan pies out there pale in comparison to this pie of delicious, gooey, fantastical goodness. So, what makes the JD pecan different from other pecan pies? For one thing you know that bakers of the Rock Springs Cafe have perfected the crust BUT what make the pecan pie special is that after you swallow your first bite of the JD pecan, you actually get a subtle after-taste of the JD. Unlike rum cakes that can overpower your taste-buds with rum or the godiva chocolate liqueurs, the pie for the most part tastes like a wholesome and really good pecan pie but the aftertaste is the JD which makes it really good. The price you pay for pie goodness is a double treat, good pecan and yummy jd!   Other than the JD (I've also had the blueberry crumble *heaven* and the cinnamon sticky bums that are GINORMOUS but sickeningly addicting coz of its buttered sweet goodness!) they have pies galore in refrigerated racks, and displays, and they're all readily available for purchase until closing til 9 or 10 pm. There are a few places that I'm willing to drive to here and around Phoenix irregardless of distance knowing that I'm always in for a treat because of what they offer, Rock Springs Cafe is that kind of place. The pies are worth the drive, and at $15.95 a pie, it's a good deal for good eats on any occasion. So i totally recommend this place, and if you're still contemplating on stopping by I suggest you do SOON!

My first time here was because of the chicken noodle soup, I heard it was a good slurp, and it's true, of all the places I've been downtown for chicken noodle soup, sticklers is hands down the best followed by the hearty chicken noodle soup of downtown deli. Anywho, I was here recently and saw their soup of the day was Cream of Mushroom, and when it comes to that kind of soup I'm a stickler (pun intended) of it because it's my favorite. Caught my reference, eh?! Well, ordered their Cream of Mushroom, and I don't know my mind was thinking of the goodness and creaminess of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom, so, perhaps I was putting it to a high standard before tasting it, I should have had sample before I committed to it too. Along with my soup I got myself a Vegetarian Sandwich on wheat.   Service was quick and prompt, not sure when the lunch rush is but I usually lunch after 1, so, I guess the time I go is when the lunch crowd becomes sparse. Back to the soup. It was steaming, and I dipped my spoon, spooned out some mushroom goodness and was taken aback that it wasn't creamy but quite watery, hmmm, I believe in taking chances, and had a taste. Yea all my high expectations came crashing down, and disappointment creeped up. I'm gonna be honest I got the Vegetarian Sandwich as an afterthought to the soup, you know, a filler. The soup was just wrong, it was watery, it lacked flavor, and i started to miss and yearn for Campbell's cream of mushroom. My sandwich was on point and Sticklers hasn't failed me with their sandwiches, and I started wishing I had the chicken noodle but I didn't want to waste the mushroom, so, I ate the mushrooms in the soup, and threw the rest away. A waste. Overall, I know never to get their mushroom soup, and to stick to the tried and tasty chicken noodle soup. I still need to try their other sandwich concoctions but I'm still a fan nonetheless.

This place is so hoity toity that I feel judged driving into the parking lot with my dusty pathfinder. Yea, can't compete with the many shiny nice rides of the biltmore who all get valet, and the regular people/riffraff are relegated to parking in either the surface lots facing camelback or the covered garage behind. But, one of my favorite Macy stores is an anchor at this tony outdoor mall. Only the best and coveted designers seem to have outlets here, and just walking, and meandering by the store fronts makes you feel regal, and window shopping isn't that bad at all. There are a good number of restos that I do like here, such as Seasons 52, Stingray with their great outdoor patio, and indoor/outdoor bar. Oh and if I want to feel healthy and eat clean, there's True Food Kitchen and across the street, the movie treat of the AMC 14 esplanade. It's a good mall to go to on a nice weather day BUT during the summers you'll find me pull in with my pathfinder into a covered garage spot, and I'll be shopping in the air conditioned confines of Macy's just taking it in. =)

If Hillcrest, San Diego has Urban Mo's, Phoenix has Charlies, and I'd pick Charlies most times. I don't know why it wins my heart, maybe it's pride knowing that as a bar, it's a landmark especially in a young city like Phoenix. They've got cheap drinks, sometimes (depending on the day) cute cowboys... and its afterhours has got good beats. It's a large bar too when it comes to the Phoenix gay club scene... not warehouse big like other clubs in other larger gay places... like Rich's in Hillcrest, or the Abbey in Weho... it's big enough with a good sized dance floor and plenty of space to walk around inside and outside. And who can beat an in house Taco Shop vendor? I mean, heck that deserves two stars alone... greasy mexican food next door without having to drive thru... heck yes! Boo... to the $3 cover after midnight for Afterhours but they got to make money over the youngin's and $3 really isn't that bad... I think I deny them one star because of the inconsistent Tic Tac shots... One barman knew how to make it right, while the other made it heck a lot strong that it was hard to swallow that I almost gagged! My four stars goes to a good atmosphere... and strong drinks but hey strong drinks are an expectation at all gay bars... so whatev. Anywho, if you're getting bored at the bar or club you're at and you need a new experience and still want to have a good time with strong drinks... make your way to Charlies!

My family and I first dined at Da Vang when it occupied a single store front in that complex, basically where the cashier is located. Imagine the side walls up for the left half of the restaurant. It was a tiny place, that was back in '94. It's 2010, and Da Vang has grown to quite a large restaurant, and the owner's son has now taken over the family restaurant. The son used to own Phoung Huang in the former Lee Lee complex at Dobson and Southern where Asiana Market and Hodori Restaurant have taken up its space.  Da Vang is a no frills kinda Vietnamese place, yes it's dirty but I've never gotten sick and I have a very weak stomach. We usually order #18 and #19, #22, #39 or #40, #42, #43, and #44, and #50 for the egg rolls. Their wide rice noodle stirfry with seafood and egg closely resembles a Malaysian favorite of mine that's usually sold by street hawkers and that's Kway Teow. YUM! Their egg noodle soups are good and quite large, and their prices are not pricey. The restaurant itself is not in a great area, since it borders Maryvale... so it's kinda sketchy. The food makes up for the restaurant's appearance and atmosphere. It's just wholesome Vietnamese home cooking, nothing special nor fancy, a place to go for a quick bite of pho, or noodle soup, and finish it off with either Vietnamese coffee or a glass of Soy Bean Milk. Simple fare and very good too!

I might be bias but it's only coz my family and I have been regulars at the Chinese dim sum joint since the late 90s. At one time it was Great Wall vs C-Fu in Chandler and now with the emergence of more Asian power centres, as well as an influx of Asians into the city, there are more dim sum places like Phoenix Palace by Lee Lee, Golden Buddha in the Cofco Center, China King in Chandler, and China Chan up north.   This place in my opinion is pretty good, and cheap. You just have to know when to go. The best time is at 11 on Sunday. Anytime after that expect a long wait, and before that (dim sum begins at 10a) it's ok but all the good stuff and most popular items and specials come out at around 11:30 in time for the rush. If you come in after 1. Expect alot of popular stuff gone =( . I'm partial to this place because my family has developed a good relationship with the servers at this place. We're not the typical dim sum diners since we also order certain items from the menu in addition to dim sum. I like their beef chow fun w/o gravy or the seafood chow fun with gravy but no fish. The salt and pepper squid is decent, and totally not a fan of the Chinese Brocolli with oyster sauce on the carts so we order the Chinese Brocolli with garlic sauce, much better and way yum! We also order a la carte so we can get rice with our meal because rice with your dim sum makes it better. Oh, and if you order roast pork, order it off the menu and not on the cart, it's a better cut and less fatty. And that calamari on the cart is not the same as the salt and pepper squid.   So when I'm craving some shu mai, char siu pao, bbq pork buns, steamed bean curd, and sugar cake, i head over to Great Wall for sunday brunch... and love the endless refills of jasmine tea! see ya at Great Wall!

ring ring ring... hi. aaa az? am i in a safe location, yes, in the parking lot. oh where? at kohl's in Chandler, crossroads, ummm.... hmmm wait a sec. Oh ok Arizona Ave and I think WIllis rd. Its by the 202 Santan freeway.... how long will it take, an hr? color car... well that's a toughie, it's a pathfinder and sometimes it seems silver and other times it's champagne... but maybe silver with a tinge of brown, no, it's not brown... it's silver-ish. Ok i'll wait... toodles!  yea that's my usual dialogue... I am an example that shouldn't be... I play up the stereotype that gay boys are unable to change the tire, i do try and i do know but hell... i don't like my hands to get dirty and plus what's the point of having AAA plus if i can't use that 100 mile towing to tow me to a discount tire to get my tires replaced and checked?  I love aaa arizona for my roadside assistance, for my towing, getting my batterty charged up, or tire changed... it's awesome. Not I'm not useless nor am I helpless I just believe that if you have the funds and want some peace of mind aaa arizona provides such a service. I also love my membership gets me discounts at certain places and since I don't have a gold card it looks good in my wallet!

The vibe and crowd at this place is awesome. It lacks the Scottsdale pretentiousness and the ridiculously douchey guys in their ed hardy's and affliction wear. Like another club close by, Dirty Pretty this place is a notch above mill ave but somehow is in the old town scene... cheers to diversity.  Went here a couple weeks ago with a friend who had someone hook us up with a table... 2 bottles for $110 and with all the chasers everything came out to around $190. So we got grey goose, and we're thinking with our group of 6... plus a few more who came later that we would finish our bottles and move on to either DP or Cream. Mind you we were at the place at 11. Well... I think we forgot that it was the large bottles,and 3 hours later and 15 people we still were not done with the second bottle, we still had a quarter left.   The dj's mix was good, people friendly, liked the different beer selection, and the manager was a nice guy. The only thing that we didn't like was the dj was not flexible with requests... lame! Oh and as much as I am a fan of unisex bathrooms, a norm at most gay clubs... with 4 bathrooms, and common sinks outside... and a line... it sucks ass! Makes for good conversations tho altho when you have to pee, you have to pee!!!  I do have to mention, it's a lounge moreso a club because it lacks an actual dancefloor, basically the space where the entrance is and the door leading to the patio is their dancefloor. Overall, it's a fun place, and I'll definitely come back on my next old town club circuit.

I've been here multiple times for brunch and i have yet to write a review. shame on me.   I love their flannels, and their hash in general. The white flannel is a must, and red flannel is a close second. the red flannel is corned beef hash, potatoes, and beets! YUM. I recently had the Mtonaco Hash, again corned beef hash, with potatoes, red peppers and provolone. delish! I usually get some pancakes to go along with the my hash, you know like a sweet afterthought. so, get the wildberry cakes, or the monkey cakes both are sweetness good. Oh, and a Smocha Mocha is a must. good eats!!

This is a place that you must bring an out of town guest to, and if you really want to be creative with how to propose marriage this would be a good place to, heck it's good for any occasions other than break-ups and affair confessions.   It's a throwback to the 50s soda parlor, it's so old school, and quite cute! Everything's pink, that it almost feels like Barbie is the owner of the store and she just wanted everyone to know pink is the color of the ultimate diva! Their's a soda bar and booths, and tables and chairs, and it's a great family friendly atmosphere. During the days it attracts families and in the evening, couples, teens, and kids at heart! I like their changing flavors of the month board where you can take out either a pint of quart of their hand packed ice cream!  They offer shakes, floats, splits, and cones/bowls of ice cream! love it! And during the day there's also a food menu limited to sandwiches. One thing you'll notice when seated are the many frames of Family Circle comics. Bil Keane the comic strip writer is a big fan of Sugar Bowl and alot of his comics mention the place, so it's pretty cool a comic strip celebrates the awesomeness of this old town landmark.   These are my favorites, the top hat sundae, the buster brownie, the Desireme (D-Sire-Me) Banana Split and the 23 skiddoo!! Love them all and if I have no plans to go out, I'm willing to trek out from my place in Chandler to Old Town to pick up some ice cream and some quarts to go! It's laid back and chill... hence I've come back ever since I first went here back in 2005. Oh and the proposal thing happened to a friend of mine, her husband proposed to her at one of the booths... I think it was the 23 skiddoo!!

Sometimes you just got to get yourself your sausage burrito fix... and it can't just be any burrito it has to be los betos! So a friend once told me that in order to judge a good burrito it has to be greasy, messy, and stuffed. Yea, los betos is damn right greasy! Once you're halfway done with your burrito it get's really messy, and I think they really fill up those burritos. I gotta admit that we Phoenicians are spoiled with our many drive-thru mexican fast food places and I'm spoiled knowing the greasy goodness of los betos. This is the place to head to after a night of drinking in old town, or simply craving carnitas with the pico and guac. So, these are my recommendations at los betos - try the carnitas burrito coz it's damn greasy and good, and if you're extra hungry, the carnitas supreme with all the fixins. If you want a breakfast burrito, go for the salchicha (sausage) burrito... the eggs, cheese and sausage is mmmmmmmmmmmmm YUM YUM... and finish it off with some horchata or jamaica... oh heaven.

I was dismayed, and heartbroken that this Yelp reviewed establishment was not cracked up to be. I'm saddened that in comparison to the Italian Grotto in old town's main drag this place fails miserably. *tear*  Went out to dinner with friends Sara V. and Lauren D., we were looking forward to enjoying some good ol' Italian goodness, just like our experience last Friday at the Grotto, this experience was sorely disappointing.   Our server was plain bad, she lied or she was lacking the know how and didn't take the time to find out. What am I talking about? Well it's Fridays and it's Lent so for Catholics, it's a day to abstain from red meat. Seafood and veg can be eaten. So when she took our orders, the ladies went for the house salad, while I chose the soup of the day which was seafood gumbo. I had asked if there was meat in the seafood gumbo in which our server rattled off without making sure, that there was no meat in the gumbo and it was all seafood. So if you've eaten gumbo, altho it may have seafood there's usually some andouille sausage. So I believed her. Salads and soup came, and lo and behold, what was in the soup? seafood yes. yuckiness yes. and drum roll pls.... a meatball. last time i checked that's meat not seafood... so the soup was a fail, and the server failed. The ladies were telling me to start a ruckus but I made the decision to myself that there would be no next time with this place.  We ordered their Frito Misto for an appetizer a mix of calamari and three shrimp. Notice the discrepancy here, 3 small breaded shrimp and a plate of calamari... with non-flavorful marinara. two stars.  seafood gumbo. zero stars.  I ordered the Pesce Alla Vodka, it was shrimp and calamari in a vodka cream sauce. three shrimp, and three scallops. it wasn't jumbo shrimp but that's ok. it was alright nothing wow. nothing that i would forget about the soup incident, silently forgive the messup and come back... no it was meh. so two stars.  unlimited garlic bread... ok. three stars.  and tiramisu for dessert... ok... let's state my favorite places for tiramisu are the Parlor and the Grotto... both are ridiculously orgasmic this one... heavy on the powder on top and lady fingers were kinda dry... if those two place are orgasmic ummm this one is more like satisfying but not good. so two and half stars.  Overall dining experience, one and a half, had to round up to two. not impressed.... seriously disappointed and for all of you who haven't been here, there's seriously better places, totally not worth it.

I pride myself as a locavore and to think it's only been since 2008 where I've become much more attuned to supporting local eats and drinks. Bandera altho a chain and part of the Houston's brand is one of those chains that I will frequent because they are worth it.  For some odd reason I like my 3s and if I were to recommend 3 items on their menu ok wait 4... but the main 3 are the Green Chile Cornbread Skillet, the Bandera Cheeseburger and the Roast Chicken. These menu items are foods that must be tried because they're good. The cornbread skillet is crumbly, moist, and simply good. It easily serves at least 3 people but the center comes out drier so ask for some extra butter in order to moisten it a little bit. The Roast Chicken is half a chicken and served with green rice (the fourth recommended item) which is divine. The Roasted Chicken is moist, and the flavors of the chicken is scrumptious. And last, the Bandera Cheeseburger which must be cooked medium but it's not served on the usual two buns, not it's like a long bun split in 3, so it comes out like large sized sliders. Along with the shoestring fries and that my foodsters is one of the best cheeseburgers on the old town drag. LOVE it! Bandera's is perfect for date nights, friend night outs, and family dinners. It's a nice laid out place with good service and totally recommend dining there. deuces!

Who would have thunk?!? South Scottsdale has a four peaks-esque brewery. From the moment you walk in you it's as if you're brought into a different city, people are laid back, chill, tables all over the place, there's a bar, and a refrigerated section filled with beers. it's loud, people are hanging out with friends, enjoying beers in different glasses according to how it should be served, and many are playing board games. I felt as though I was in Austin at some bar, found a table plopped myself down and looked at the different brews offered. It seems Papago brewing has 5 brews to their name one of which is the Orange Blossom that my friends is manna. it's a light beer that after first sip, the aftertaste gives you a light hint of orange creamsicle goodness. YUM!! served with an orange slice, the beer tastes good until the last drop. I am a fan of the Peach beer of four peaks but this yelpers is better because the Orange Blossom has the ongoing blossoming of flavor!   The food offered is nothing special, it's food to fill your stomach to prevent you from getting too drunk, and something to nosh on while enjoying beers, laughs, conversations, and soaking up the atmosphere. After my tall pint of Orange Blossom, I got myself a pint of another Papago brew - the Elsie (Irish Coffee Cream Stout). I liken this dark beer to black coffee with a hint of sweetness, it's heavy and good. It just sucks that I couldn't finish my whole pint due to being full from our shared plate of pizza bites and chicken quesadilla. And get this, it cost $4.59 per draft. CHEAP! and afterwards my crew and I walked out of the porthole and found ourselves back in South Scottsdale in a strip mall that bears the Papago name.

uhm super burrito whatever you put in your Arizona Quesadilla minus the pico makes that quesadilla so freakin' greasy and good that i used to be enamored by Los Betos Carnitas and Carne Asada quesadillas. I'm sorry Los Betos I still heart you but Super Burrito just got my "I love your quesadillas" vote! So yum, cheap, and good!

You could be having a shitty day, grieving over a good friend, celebrating the joys of life or just looking to chill after a hard day at work, whatever the reason you sometimes just need a pint!   Four Peaks on eighth street provides that. I love their Kiltlifter, their peach ale, and hefweisen and during the month of October their Pumpkin Porter... YUM stuff! couple that pint with their heavily loaded chicken nachos, a plate of beer fries, and their Arizona Chicken Rolls... and my friends you got a feast! I like they have happy hours and reverse happy hours. I remember times I've spent coming here on Friday evenings, and on Saturdays after an ASU football game... good times and memories. Parking sucks but the atmosphere is kick ass!    If you get  the beer fries ask for the jalapeno ranch... YUM! Oh and Peach ale is best when cold! I like the misters outside... and even during the summers i'd rather be outside coz it seems much cooler than inside. I like the overall feel of this place and it's worth coming for just that pint... sharing a few laughs and spending good times over some beer fries!

Yea it still retains its 4 stars and this has been confirmed with my love of the Oatmeal Stout. I guess I never realized how good a pint of this stout but had a pint of it last friday and enjoyed every sip of it. Yes it's dark, but it's medium bodied and the flavor is delicious! omg i'm talking beer. oh my. Like always their beer battered fries are simply the best especially with Sweet Jalapeno Ranch dip on the side it just makes the experience awesome.  But... this time after many visits over a period of five years, yes the parking sucks and during the summers it gets sticky with the misters and the large fans attempting to circulate air inside and on the patio. this time me and dani ordered dessert. The idea of dessert was aroused when we were waiting for our pager to buzz while hanging out by the bar, dani with her regular peach beer and my hefweizen. we saw a slice of chocolate fabness on a plate passing by, so, we made note and agreed that we would not really eat our oversized entrees and ensure we'd have room to eat some cake! Well the agreement was more of i'd have a little cake but nevertheless. Had the fish and chips which were DELISH... YUMMY! and we finally order the cake of least resistance the oatmeal stout tiramisu! Now this slice of tiramisu is meant to be shared by a village of dieters or a gang of dessert whores because it's mammoth prehistoric huge. The chocolate topping with the whipped cream, tiramisu filling and oatmeal stout deliciousness makes this dessert almost feel like a sexxxy party in your mouth, the flavor is fireworks good! ok i'm salivating for a some now. BUT yes get a slice and ensure you and your dessert gang eat some. so i end this with. OATMEAL STOUT!

For a local chain this is one of my favorites. OH Oregano's you make me laugh with your innuendos, your yummy thin crust pizzas, and you've had me with your pizzookies from the first time I've had one. I am grateful alone that I live in a city that has such a ridiculously wonderful and unique specialty that no other place has (that i know of)! Their pizzookies are a great alternative other than drinking if you were in a breakup, a boy passed you up (yes i'll eat my feelings if need be, and that's if a brown bag special passed me up), you failed a test, or had a shitty day.  I love that their pizzookies are either choco chip white macadamia nut or oatmeal raisin. you can do half and half too! and served with two scoops of ice creams makes this an awesome snack or after dinner treat. Anywho... love it!

As the 48th State to join the Union, the landscape of this great land is varied and beautiful. I'm not sure if this location is the center of Arizona but I can say its capitol Phoenix, and its surrounding metropolitan area is spread out and each city has its own identity.   The scenery is awe inspiring and at times almost surreal, from the out of the world scenes of monument valley in northeastern Arizona, the snowcapped San Francisco peaks of Flagstaff, the greatness of the Grand Canyon, the bright color hues of the red rocks of Sedona, the pines of the Mogollon Rim to the majesty of the vast Sonoran Desert, this state is a true artistic representation of how beautiful our land can be.   Its capitol Phoenix is not too shabby either with its great freeway system, it's grid like planning, and picturesque views with the landmark Camelback Mountain in its center, the red lights of South Mountain and the largest public park to the iconic "A" Mountain of Arizona State University, the metro Phoenix is truly a Queen of the desert.   Overall I'm proud to be a resident of this great state, and despite its current trials, and tribulations, the celebrations we do enjoy and love, I affectionately call myself a Zonie, and love my home. =)

Dilly's Deli became part of my vocab when I was a sophomore at ASU, I was with my fellow SAA crew and one of the girls had me take a bite of her Mexi-wrap, and after that first mmmmmmm everything else is history. There are 4 sandwich items that I commonly order of the Dilly board and that is: Dilly Bird, the Dilly Club, the Southwestern Club and the Gobbler all can be paired with the YUMMIEST chicken noodle soup in a bread boule. I love the toasted bread, the hefty sandwiches, the meat used, and the overall taste. There are times I crave Dilly's and during those rare cold overcast days we get during winter in the valley, I head over at times to my closest Dilly's (in S. Chandler) or drive to the Dilly's by campus on University Dr. and have a chicken noodle soup *yum*... we Sun Devils are just plain lucky!

DELICIOUS!!   Sometimes I crave a good steak, some yummy roasted chicken or a slice of delicious roast pork but Green has changed my food wants, recently I've been craving the delicious goodness of Green's awesome food.   From first bite of the drunken mushroom chicken Green won me over. I do love mushrooms but the mock chicken totally fooled my carnivore mind. I love the flavors in the dish and how it was made together. Since my first time last Thursday 3/28 I have been in love with this place. I've had their samosas which are good, the Singapore Tofu noodle, yum yum! the vegan chili fries, outstanding (although next time I'm getting the chili on the side to avoid sogginess)! yes, thyme fries are my new loves. lol. the buffalo spicy "wings" are on point. BuT the one thing that makes Green extra awesome are their... Tsoynamis!!! These vegan treats, wait are they vegan? hmm still are worth my cheat days!! YUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYY! The PB&J is so freaking good, love the peanut butter especially, the butterfinger is just addicting and the banana cream pie is my new crush!   Green thank you for being around and thank you for your awesome bites. love you. Oh and they have Vitmo... yea that's a star for just being kick-ass!! =)

Oh TJ's what would I do without you? shop at Whole Foods? no, too pricey. shop at Sprouts? eh, I like their produce deals but it ends there. TJ's is my favorite grocery in which I tend to do most of my shopping there with the exception of produce because of the limited selection :-(. But I'm a fan of almost everything else offered. Love the different bread selection which may not be as extensive but substantial. The cheeses on sale are good, it's a wide selection and meets the basics. Their snack items are good, never pass up on their TJ's reduced fat cheese curls *yum* and the juice packs are sooo good too! But what I love about TJ's is their Tempe location at McClintock and Guadalupe. The complex has such a cool vibe mainly because TJs are neighbors with changing hands bookstore and wildflower bakery. The staff at this TJs are really nice, and I like the layout as well as overall feel to the store. I sometimes  shop at their Ahwatukee foothils location but for some odd reason, the TJs Tempe is way better, maybe because this is a more established location, oh and there are alot of cute guys that work at the Tempe location *just an observation* so I guess makes my shopping visits worth it! ;-)

At the start of the Old Town drag by the courtyard of the Scottsdale Museum of Contermporary Art (SMoCA) and an art piece dedicated to LOVE stands a longtime jewel of the Old Town scene. At this place, you feel concious of how you appear for there are beautiful women and handsome men with their lovers, and stalkers, laughing, smiling, flirting, kissing, loving... life... and AZ88. This restaurant/nightspot has been a subject of lore. At this place the martinis are big and kickin and for an evening you can feel simply beautiful and sexy. The music is pumpin with sick beats by their dj upstairs. There's an art piece in the center that exudes sex...iness. And the bar reminds you of how this LA-esque place is here in our turf but Scottsdale is not Phoenix, it's a bit of San Diego, a bit of Santa Monica, a bit of the Marina in San Fran. And you realize that its handsome men with handsome men and hot women with sexy ladies and everything in between. This is the place for gay men and women, and straight allies.   The drinks are delish, and exquisite, here a glass of something with bubbles just makes sense, couple it with a martini or two with shaker makes sense. And their burger au poivre just messes with the senses... it's overwhelming and so good! This place is contemporary chic. Not ikea chic like its hot cousin FEZ in our cenpho which in my opinion is attaining landmark status on central. This place celebrates the hotness of the old town crowd. So if ever I want a late night place, and want to see and be the scene. I head over with some hot teases and have a fun time. hope to see you there one night, just wink.

I'm excited there's sushi at Delux, it's a great add-on to what is an already good late night eats resto. It would be wrong of me to not be appreciative of their burgers, especially the Delux Turkey burger. It's one of the few places I've been to where the Turkey burger comes out moist and not dried out, and served with a really good cilantro and garlic aioli. The fries (they have both regular and sweet potato) served in the mini shopping carts is a great concept, and the micro brewery they have makes Delux a good place to grad a bite and enjoy a brew. As for the sushi, it's decent and does satisfy any late night cravings since they have reverse happy hour from 10 to close daily. It's a good eats kinda place and one of my late night favorites, it's worth a try.

I was thoroughly not impressed! first of, the sunday brunch price was $28.99 with tax came out to $31. It's a champagne brunch with all you can drink. While standing in the long line granted it was during the peak brunch time at around noonish, I could see the extensive choices. There's selection, like an American station, Mexican station, Middle Eastern (this includes Indian, weird!), Asian, Italian (apparently pancakes and french toast are Italian), a breakfast station, a dessert station, a seafood station and two salad stations. As I said, it's extensive. So, I was hungry, my belly was growling and I remember seeing someone eating a cotton candy as they were leaving Spice Market so I was intrigued by this. Anywho, stood in line, paid, stood in line yet again and my party of five was eventually seated after a half hour wait. So we gave our drink orders, and a friend and I took our turn to get our food. Of course I was excited, I saw on the screens while we were waiting that was chicken curry at the Middle Eastern station so I knew I had to get some. Grabbed two plates and started with an Eggs benedict, BACON, got some chicken curry, tandoori chicken, some steamed rice, a steamed pork bun (yea i was getting my feast on) and proceeded back to the table to get crunk with my food. Sadly that was not to be, the chicken curry was salty and lacked flavor (what happened to spice? huh Spice Market?!), the tandoori chicken was rubbery and so lackluster, it felt limp in my mouth =( , the steamed rice was not that soft (like how do you mess that up?!), the Eggs Benedict egg was not runny but COOKED through, seriously?!! The only two things that were satisfactory was the bacon and the pork bun. So I thought maybe it's a fluke? I must have chose the wrong food items, so back I went to the buffet and this time, I got a blueberry and cherry crepe, a slice of french toast, some fruit (cantaloupe and pineapple) and a fruit cobbler. the crepe was meh I've had way better, the french toast was limp and blah, the fruit not sweet and the fruit cobbler was generic. The $31 was money wasted, I might have been full from sampling everything but I was not satisfied, rather I felt cheated. In my opinion for the money you spend, the same price could be better spent at other brunch buffets elsewhere on the strip like Mandalay Bay, the Rio or Stratosphere. I'm not a big buffet person but this buffet is a no-go in the future.

I've been a repeat customer of FEZ since last Sep. 2008, and since then I've come in for lunch, brunch, dinner and the reverse happy hour. And at one time... ok... multiple times I would consistently rave to my east valley friends who don't travel out to CenPho of FEZ and their awesome margaritas especially my fave, the honeydew melon. Then one time... I think it was dinner with my friends V and Rob, I was introduced to my now ultimate favorite of all things yum and sparkling and that's the apricot chardonnay (insert angels ahh-ing here).  I can tell you how the FEZ burger is like the yummiest burger out there... and the Turkey burger is a close second to the Delux Turkey burger. But... if I were to crown FEZ... it would be the cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries! That my amigos is the best sweet potato fries around... it's sooo good, so yummy, so worth the calories... and add a liter of the apricot chardonnay or the pomegranate cranberry and you're in foodie heaven. And if the sweet potato fries are not the only best thing... it's the cheesecake....... DELISH!!! I sing praises to FEZ and I'm so glad to have had that awesome first experience when I first came in that late September evening... that I ended up celebrating my birthday there three weeks later. Oh.... so back to my review.  So last weekend, after my mediocre dinner at Hula's my friend M and I drove over to FEZ for some dessert and a coffee. After having the FEZ coffee at brunch one time which was oh so good... FEZ is one of those few spots that I'd be willing to go to for a late evening dessert and coffee talk. So as our evening was progressing and being seated my a friendly FEZ host (did I tell you that the staff at FEZ have always been friendly, and have never really given attitude and I like the service? Oh well they are. =))  Anyways, we ordered dessert, the FEZ brownie and mentioned to our server... (i think her name was Amanda) we'd like lots of cream with our coffee... she returned a few minutes later telling us that they had apparently run out of regular coffee but still had decaf. We were saddened... well I was... and the idea of dessert and water with good company still sounded ok it just wasn't the same since I expected something to pick me up in order to keep our conversation flowing. So she proceeded to give us options like the Earl Grey instead but a hot cup of joe sounded way better, so we told her we were okay. Anywho, when our dessert was served, our cheerful server surprised us with coffee mugs with regular coffee and lots of cream. She went all out and above and beyond to scrounge around and found apparently the last package of regular coffee and brewed a pot in order to satisfy her customers. I mean... that's service and this is why I love FEZ... it's the ambiance, the restaurant, the service, the food, and the overall package. You've seen the reviews and if you haven't tried FEZ yet... I say you oughta because this place is a gem!

i've been to copper star since it first opened, pre-yelp days for me and my locavore ways were still being established but eversince my first copper star experience I've been in love with this coffeehouse. I just love their place, the former gas station turned coffeehouse makes this place as one of the places i bring out of town guests to show them that Phoenix does have its little gems and 7th ave or "melrose" is just quaint. Anywho, I've had good chai here, and yummy creamy nonfat vanilla lattes but only recently did I try a pastry treat. The lady behind the counter was a sweetheart and she made me feel extra special when she liked my "human" shirt and asked who designed it... yes that day i was proud to be a Gay Black Woman... as my shirt starts off with. I bought myself the nonfat vanilla latte with carrot cake cupcake that had what seemed was an extra dollop of cream cheese frosting, DeLISH! it was truly carrotrific, and the cupcake provided a great sweetness kick to go with my extra caffeinated beverage. Copper Star may not be a Lux with it's urban chic interior, or the real bohemian interior of Lola on Roosevelt or the hipster cool of Cartel in Tempe, no, Copper Star is simply cool with its venue and hold its own with its great drinks, coffees and treats, so hence Copper Star is truly a coffeehouse star!

This bar has been part of the valley gay scene for so long... from what i've heard it's been around here for more than twenty years, another landmark but what impresses most is not solely its longevity in Phoenix but that its been in Old Town Scottsdale all this time away from what people call gay Phoenix in downtown.   My first introduction to BS West was a long time ago... well long to me... back in 2005. I had been to Charlie's, and at one time there was Crowbar which is now Club Downtown. Also had been to Boom! But never heard of BS West until someone mentioned on facebook group of a gay club hidden behind Acme in Old Town. They described it as the gay club down the alley that it was hidden that anyone could easily miss it. So I went with two friends and based on pure curiousty, walked down the alley next to Acme and saw a door (pre-patio days) with a sign above it that said BS West. It was a Sat. and it wasn't too crowded but we were in awe... it was true there was an actual gay bar near Tempe. And that's how I was introduced to the 2-4-1 drink specials and the BS West chips.   This video bar of which I think is its only kind in Phoenix and really haven't found any other video bars in other gay havens is such a nifty idea. I mean, haven't you ever been in a club and just didn't want to dance but the song is so good, that you gotta do something? well the video bar concept is awesome in that you can drink and watch the music video and kinda dance along... LOVE IT! You can never beat the drink specials here on Wed. which has always been 2-4-1 and Sat nights too. Both nights are crazy packed... that I'm sure it's against fire code but there's no restrictions... just a mass of gay men, and all kinds too, intermingle some queer peers too and it's just a great environment! Strong drinks too. But what I love apart from the drink specials are the poker chips which you can use as currency in the future. Certain colors mean certain drinks like cocktails, shots and the like. The Dj usually plays a good mix but depends who's there and if there having an off night but if you want a good time, strong drinks, and just a packed atmosphere... check out BS West or BS!

this is my go to spot  on Sunday nights when i just want conversation time with my close gfs and to satisfy my appletini cravings. Prior to Wildfish my past experiences with appletinis have not been satisfactory. Depending on where I get them, they come out too strong, too sweet, or too sour. Not sure the name of the bartender at Wildfish but her appletinis are DELICIOUS! Oh, I forgot to mention I come on Sundays because they have all night happy hour in the bar area where some of the appetizers are discounted as well as some signature cocktails. I've had the calamari numerous times and it's delish! the crunchy asian rice noodle that's sprinkled on the large serving of calamari makes this app so worth it! and, their truffle mac and cheese (small serving's $5) is so spoon licking good! I've had good times with friends, good and attentive service and the discounted appletinis at $5 apiece during hh is worth the visit. so stop by!

I've been meaning to write a review of this awesome bar. Previous to my first actual drinking experience at the Roosevelt, I had been there during First Fridays. Bad decision. It's a small craftsman converted house so couple it with its popularity, the masses and its location smack dab by the Roosevelt street fair this place was packed.   I love that you walk in through the door into a room where you see a small bar with 4 stools, in the first room there's a table for two, and a sofa chair. The back room has a long table for 6. and the side rooms have three table that can see 2 to 3 ppl each, and the other street facing room can fit 2 groups of maybe 4 at most each. So you can imagine of FF it's a little claustrophobic. Anywho, I made a mental note to come back. So I went on a Thursday evening and that evening I was craving a grilled cheese and I heard about the most amazing things about the grilled cheese with tomato soup, so I ordered it with a true pint of belgian witte. OMFG... that grilled cheese was YUM! and a deep bowl of steaming tomato soup! with a real cold true pint of belgian witte that mind you when even with a third left the glass and beer was still cold. AMAZING! not sure how they do that but 4 peaks take note por favor! The server had a wine deal where she's said if you ordered a wine bottle and consumed more than 2 glasses that they would charge the bottle for 50% less. fun stuff. I just have to say it was kinda dark but it would make a great place to bring a special someone and enjoy each other's company. Friends work too =P Overall loved the Roosevelt and will return... Oh and let's say their menu had both sides filled with all the beers they offered... I think more than 50 to 60 or so! love it... an ode to you the Roosevelt!

When i first stumbled upon this bakery it was during my lunch hour and i was getting bored with my usual selections at Sack's next door, so, i decided to give it a try after reading a review of Essence on the Chowbella blog. Anywho, I was saddened that they no longer had any croissants and only a few macarons left, so, I ordered a Quiche Lorraine along with a side order of the Spanakopita. I guess I was in true hunger mode, and the smells wafting through the air of the baked goodies along with the lingering scent of the already gone croissants were making my tummy rumble far more than usual. So, maybe I had an expectation that the price I paid for a Quiche Lorraine at $7.95 would be satisfying to match my hungriness. Sadly this was not the case instead the Quiche turned out quite petit and somehow the portions were really meant for a light lunch. My first visit was marred by my expectations of the food and although quite good in itself with taste and quality ingredients it took awhile for me to come in for another visit until this morning.   When Phoenix New Times, yelpers, and other food enthusiasts have simply raved about the croissants (both plain and chocolate), you know... you just have to try it at least once. And I will tell you... yes... these croissants are close to perfect. so light, flaky, buttered goodness! I am not a croissant connosieur at all not even close simply due to the fact that I am more of a pastry fan and would rather have cake, or some stuffed cheese pastry moreso than a croissant but sometimes the hankering gets me that I need a cafe au lait with a croissant. Any maybe I have a bias with my other croissant love at P. Croissant in South Tempe but believe you me... these croissants are heavenly. They are so scrumptious and buttery, that every bite seems to have a layer of lightly buttered deliciousness, and it messes with your senses of how good this is. So, if you have time before work, stop by for a croissant and a cafe au lait, or enjoy saturday brunch at this wholesome bakery. it's worth it, and Essence, thank you for your perfect croissants. i'm in love.

YUM! Having grown up in the Middle East in the Sultanate of Oman during my formative years, I grew up eating Indian cuisine and snacks since it was readily available in grocery stores and Indian restaurants throughout the capital, Muscat. Muscat, Oman has an Indian expat population of more than 300K so Indian food in Muscat is like Mexican food is here in Phoenix, it's just part of the culture. Anywho, ever since moving back to Phoenix for college, I've always craved some good samosas and cheap chaat.   Little India provides that with their spicy samosas, their delectable chaat, all at low prices. Whenever I have a craving for a samosa, I can't resist the temptation of just buying one, I usually walk out the store with two, three or sometimes 4 samosas to go. Their samosas remind of the ones I used to buy at the Spinney's Supermarket in Muscat. They're  plump filled with potato, peas, carrots, and curry powder or whatever the spice is in it, and it has a kick. Although in Oman you could get chicken, mutton, or veg samosas. But it's cool with me that it's veg, nothing wrong with that! I've only gone for the snacks at Little India and have never gone grocery shopping at the store, so if you're looking for some chaat I recommend you stop by and try it out, it'll be worth your time!

YUCK! ick! ewwwww! would be how I'd describe my lunch at Sun Asian Kitchen. Whatever was served was albeit presentable but in terms of taste not good at all. I ordered the wonton soup and the Honey Chicken combo (comes with a chicken eggroll, and choice of fried rice, steamed rice or lo mein, brown rice is extra). The wonton soup had a weird taste to it, the broth was alright and the vegetables included in the soup canned. The Honey Chicken combo arrived shortly after, and it looked promising. And what goodness it seemed to offer ended after the first bite. I know how to cook fried rice, and yes, fried rice is made with day old rice but what I had was the rice at the bottom of the pan, there were hard bits to it that would stick to my teeth and there was no flavor to it, as for flavor, the honey chicken had nothing close to it being honey chicken, and the dish tasted off. It was a mess. I was hoping to at least enjoy the chicken minus the lackluster fried rice but the fried pieces of chicken was mostly batter and less chicken. And the sauce was just too sweet and thick that I really didn't know what I was eating hence I just stopped eating and considered my lunch a loss. =( I agree with a yelper that sun asian kitchen is a step above fast food but if I were to compare this tragedy with Panda Express, I'd take Panda over this hot mess. Overall my experience at Sun Asian Kitchen was bad sauce, and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone at all. I'm sorry Sun Asian Kitchen, you're a bad news bear. =(

the G-spot offers a smorgasbord of different flavors... more than 20 flavors for sure! A cup of gelato offered single scoop, double, and triple melts away all the trouble clouding your mind or for a brief period enjoying this sweet concoction of deliciousness and all things yum and creamy you put your troubles aside and enter the happy zone of gelato world.   Like any good gelato establishment samples are encouraged especially since there are too many flavors and the combinations are endless, like a scoop of the rum raisin with the roche. I tend to go for the gelato's with liqueurs since there's nothing wrong with some yummy alcohol mixed in with cream.   At G-spot they explain the positives of why gelato is better than ice cream, it's a spin but heck explain all you want and in the end I'll look at it and be like..."of course gelato is better than ice cream with 32% less butterfat, my body should thank me that I chose this healthier option! Oh another cup you say? Ok... (tell myself, reassure myself... it's healthy) one more please =)". Gelato mi amigos is worth the calories!! YUM!!!  This location is at the corner of 3rd ave and Scottsdale, so it's outside seating makes a good place to people watch, and the layout of the store has couches, and numerous tables to sit with large windows, and free wi-fi. It's an awesome place and the prices are inexpensive. SO if I'm not feeling a froyo run, my next option is gelato and this is the place that I frequent! Oh and this is an awesome place for an after dinner date!

It took awhile for me to accept Ahwatukee as my de facto TJ's because it's closer to where I live than the Tempe location at McClintock but I think what has won my loyalty with this location are the staff. As a frequent TJs shopper and my bff Sara V. can vouch for that since most times I'm on the phone with her at TJs, the staff at the Awhatukee get the four stars over the Tempe shop. Ok... granted there are some cute guys at TJ Tempe, this one has staff that actually talk... no, actually remember you and be genuinely friendly and not "friendly because I have to be since it's customer service". I feel so bad that I don't know the girl who's the friendliest to me at TJ Ahwatukee but when I shop there she makes my visits worthwhile! The store is larger well maybe slightly larger than the Tempe location but it's got a good layout to it. Never had complaints with TJs whatsoever, for the most part they have been flexible with items I have returned and the prices are cheaper than Whole foods and AJ's. I heart you Ahwatukee TJ!

Now this must be how movie heaven feels like. As a pauper =( having the opportunity to enjoy the experience a couple times a year does it for me. It's first class seats and service for a mere $15 for a movie ticket, then add on drinks and an appetizer, and you end up spending close to $40. Not bad, especially if it's a real big blockbuster movie, then it makes it more worth it. check it out, it's awesome.

Dr. Lieber has been my primary physician for the last three years. The reason I chose this man was his specialty in Internal Medicine since he would be much more attuned in the going on's of my body. His hours are not bad from 7:30am until 4p, i think M-F.   I like that blood work can be done at his office as well as how he interacts with his patients. He provides advice and suggestions and ensures that you ask questions, and when you do he provides not a brief broad answer but rather he looks into it. Like his staff as well. So for a primary physician I fully recommend him!

I might be bias since I work at this campus but I gotta admit, the ASU Downtown Phoenix Campus has appeal. It's a different world compared to the Tempe campus which is a university campus surrounded by an urban setting, Downtown campus is a university set amidst an urban setting. No, it's nowhere close to New York University in Manhattan but where ASU is situated is that it's centrally located in the Phoenix downtown area next to the Transit Center, and an urban park. Everything is within walking distance, CityScape on Washington is less than 6 minutes walk and the Roosevelt Arts District is north of it and less than 5 minutes away. As a campus, it can be recognized by the School of Journalism building on Central, and the University Center building just south of it. Basically the campus starts at the YMCA building to the west, Journalism building to the north, Arizona Center and University Mercado to the east, and the University Center Building to the south. It encompasses more than 6 blocks. It's a good start for ASU, and it's nice to see the university expanding its presence downtown. I wish the university was in more buildings spread throughout downtown instead of a specific area, I think it will eventually get there with the revitalization of the Jefferson warehouse district south of the sport arena but right now it's a good place to be. :)

I am and always will be a fan of Carolina's. I've been to the Original location at 12th St and Mohave and within my family that's my favorite location but my parents and one of my brother's prefers this Carolina's. I think it's because it's open later and the neigborhood doesn't look too risky plus it looks cleaner.   Anywho, Carolina's just has really good Mexican food, I like their Chimichangas, their burros, and their tortillas. OH their tortillas is one of the best in the Phoenix area, and is comparable to the tortilla shops in south tucson. I always get a chicken chimi with the works, and i'm always content. I also get myself a cheese quesadilla because the melted cheese in their buttery fluffy tortillas are outta this world. *yum*   The drive to this Carolinas might be farther for me but it's a great alternative to the original location if you find yourself in north phoenix. Oh plus you can have dinner over here since they close at 8:30 or 9.

As a longtime Sprint subscriber I remember a time where I would avoid Sprint customer service at the corporate store in favor of waiting 30 minutes to talk to a phone rep. reason? at least i wouldn't have to deal with mediocre customer service face to face. Anywho ever since the new CEO of Sprint took over in 2008, I have to admit, customer service in person and on the phone has changed substantially. Finally you have reps who help you with your problems and are willing to assist.   I went to this location a couple months back when I preordered my Samsung Epic, staff were courteous and ready to answer my questions without attitude. Although attitude can creep up later in the day and that's unavoidable at times if you're just having a crappy day or been dealing with inept customers, i digress and it seems I'm a sprint apologist but i'm not. So, this location had Sprint reps that ensured the transfer of my contacts from my pre to my epic went smoothly and ensured that I walked out the store with my new epic in hand without problems.   I have to mention to all the sprint haters out there, Sprint has changed from bad service to good customer service and satisfaction. And now, I would prefer to go in store rather than on the phone because at least this time there's an actual person who is willing to assist, and no need for over the phone surveys =)

Sometimes when I'm craving a boba tea... I stop by the Boba Tea House by Lee Lee grocery. Unlike other places that sell boba this is the place to be because of its large selection! Upon walking in to the establishment, you realize how it has this contemporary modern feel to it with the flat screen tv and couches. To the left are three large menu boards with more than 50 boba tea drinks, slushes, smoothies, and hot teas. Interesting menu items such as the volcano, sunrise and so forth, and staple flavors like taro, pineapple, strawberry, then they have durian, and lychee. Apart from boba drinks they also have snack items like fries, calamari, wings, potstickers etc. Prices are cheap and the overall product is good. So, if you have a hankering for some boba and are in the Lee Lee complex, stop by, coz it's worth it!

If i'm looking for a great selection of produce, I like the fact that i have choices. I think that's the benefit of living in the suburbs. Choice wise I can go to either Lee Lee or Sprouts. My favorite Sprouts location was the first one in Chandler and I think in the Phoenix area. Anywho, what I love about Sprouts is that the prices are cheap and their specials especially double Wednesdays. DoubleTuesdays/ Wednesdays (not sure)!?! It works like this the specials from the week before run from wed. to wed. and the new specials take over the same wed. ending... so let's say the special running was 4 apples/$1 and the following new week it was 5 apples/$1 so on that wed. from the week it was 25 cents an apple and the new week it's 20 cents so with the savings combined you get a very good deal. How's that for customer appreciation... LOVE IT! As for produce, Sprouts usually makes sure to go for local which is awesome because they support the state farmers. low prices fresh produce make my Sprouts shopping quite worthwhile, and love that they stay open from 8a to 10p weeknights and Sat. yay!

I would like to say that I am a repeat car rental subscriber whenever I feel the urge to take a loooong roadtrip across state lines. The Enterprise rental place I tend to frequent is the location closest to home at Alma School and Germann in the Cobblestone complex. The personnel at this place are quite friendly, and always willing to bend over backwards to ensure you get the car you're asking for. At times they can be particularly busy due to the high influx of customers renting and returning cars, regardless of how busy they are they still treat the customer with a smile and a can do attitude hence this is why I prefer this Enterprise. Oh and while you wait there's a Dunkin Donuts closeby as well as a kick ass convenience store!

I went to Sushi Brokers on 3/12 with my friend Lauren for dinner. North Scottsdale really isn't our turf but we were gonna hang with a friend who was house sitting afterwards, and since it was a Friday, and it's lent... I could only eat seafood and veggies... so sushi was on our dinner agenda!   I looked up Sushi Brokers on my Yelp app and noticed the many reviews about the place, so I decided to chance it over the more acclaimed Yasu Sushi on Cactus. Upon our arrival at Sushi Brokers, at around 6, we were told to expect a 40 minute wait, as for the bar, it was first come, first serve.   It's a small place but ridiculously crowded, so one can expect it to be a good happy hour spot with great specials and decent food, or its crowded with people who have no idea that there's a better sushi place elsewhere.  Luckily for Lauren and I we were constantly looking for a bar opening, and found two seats. Upon seating we were given two sheets one for happy and one for sushi orders. This is where Sushi Broker get its 4th star! No idea who the guy at the bar was, I just know he had a tattoo sleeve, and he looked cute, realized that happy hour had just ended but he told us he'd let it slide with us coz it had just ended, so we ordered a vegas, tootsie, and crunch roll, one kirin light bomber, a plate of vegetable tempura and calamari. A feast! I have to admit that was an awesome attempt on winning fans of your establishment plus it's the advantages of sitting at the bar hehehe.  The portions were huge for happy hour, well what's funny is that some establishments in Tempe believe in short changing customers with slightly smaller orders during happy hour or a extremely limited menu... like Sushi Eye in Motion.   Anywho, it was a large order of veggie tempura, the calamari was alright, the tootsie was delish, and the crunch was a little more than decent. So as we were eating and drinking, we realized altho the service was ridiculously fast ( we ordered at 6:40, got our food at 6:50), we were still waiting for the vegas roll.So we asked the guy with the sleeve on the eta of our vegas roll, of which he reassured us that it would be coming out in a few minutes. Satisfied, and enjoying the atmosphere, the thumpa of the music, the good looking boys and girls, the good food, and the cute boys at the bar name sleeve dude and his counterpart the shaved head dude (yea, yea... we know we're bad but it was loud so we didn't catch their names, and i was already on my whole day buzz), I noticed shaved head dude was making this martini kind drink, it looked pretty, and my sake was boring me. So, I asked what it was and he (insert Ke$ha song here... Blah Blah Blah) told me the ingredients... ZzZz...and said it was a Witch Doctor. Ok Kiddos, interesting fact, if I'm enjoying myself, and already buzzed if a drink looks pretty and you can tell me it's sweet, I'm sold. SO I ordered it alongside my sake bomber. Ladies and boys... that was a kickass drink!! LOVE IT... and only if I knew what was in it I would order everytime I went out! He did mention something that you drink 10 of those and still not get a hangover... I'm planning to try him on that challenge. It apparently has antioxidants and b-12 vitamins.   Anywho back to the Vegas roll, it came with two other rolls... which apparently was our original order and there was a mix up. so we got two free rolls extra, score!! Love ya Brokers... love your specials, your Witch Doctor drink, and yummy sushi!! Plan to come back before an outing... maybe easter weekend!!

that's a damn good sandwich! it's the bread I tell ya, it's just soooooooo yummy and toasty and yummy good. If I were to give up carbs altogether, this place would be my cheat, I loved Earl so much that I went there twice in one day, in the morning for breakfast and again for an after-drinking meal. I had the Full Montagu, the Earl of Club and the Italian. The Full Montagu was delish but the Earl of Club was phenomenol (they're hefty btw) and these panini type sandwiches are worth every calorie. The price is also a great selling point too, $5.99 on the strip is a steal! A sandwich, drink, and chips is around $10. Love it! Oh and sweet cream brownie are plus points while you're waiting for your food. =)

If only it wasn't all the way up there... i'd be on it like a lush at the FEZ happy hour... margaritas, martinis oh my! Anyways that's how I would describe my dinner outing to Los Reyes de la Torta with my best, Sara V.   She thought of it and I bought it... so off we went after work on Monday night to Los Teyes de la Torta for some Torta goodness. The only Torta I've had prior is at Gallo Blanco. and they Ribeye there is delicious but here we were at Los Reyes and the menu was huuugggge! Sara V. was hungry so we started with an app, the chicharron quesadilla estilo del rey which is with queso, pico, onions, and jalapenos. I got horchata as a drink, and Sara V. got mango juice. Felt tropical and I guess it went with the feeling of mugginess outside. Anywho, the quesadilla was big, and really a meal in itself. For our entrees we decided to split two tortas, they were the Arizona Torta  and the Mexicana Torta - steak, sauteed onions, jalapenos. They were both big in its own right, half a torta is filling on its own.   Sum up our experience, the tortas are really good, altho i can always pass up the Mexicana and try something else. The horchata was alright, nothing phenomenal unlike La Condesa which has a very interesting and really yummy Horchata. Not a big fan of Mexican mangoes coz personally I don't think that they're sweet, Filipino mangoes are still Queen! The quesadilla was yummy, liked it very much. I think it's proof that when more than half their clientele are Latinos is that it's a good torta shop. The dinner was not pricey and I had leftovers but really liked it and will come back soon!

LOVES the trattoria, the wine bar, the Japanese kitchen, the deli, the bakery, the sweet republic ice cream case, the barbeque station, and how awesome the Chandler Whole Foods is. Yes, it pales in comparison to the flagship store in downtown Austin but as an AZ Whole Foods I can't complain. I love my large assortment of good foods, organic buys, and delicious foods that are there for my buying power pleasure.   I love the organic ice creams and sorbets, I do enjoy their mac and cheese and have only bought it once from their hot foods section. Yes I am very impressed by their olives bar, and yes I do like that there are two soup stations that offer close to six or seven different soups. But apart from their great selections I also like their employees. I've experienced good customer service, pleasant smiles, and kindred hellos. Hence i'm a FAN. I heart my Whole Foods!!!

F&E are like glorified convenience stores in the US but its size works best in urban settings and not in suburbia where space is unlimited. I'm still surprised there isn't a F&E like concept in downtown Phoenix where I'm sure it would be a hit! Anywho, I'm not really a big F&E shopper and only stop in for convenience items, like cane sugar if I ran out when baking a cake, or buying a ready-made salad if I'm too lazy to make my own (which is most of the time!).   For the most part, this location has friendlier staff than the one by my house, and its organization is typical of F&E stores as well as cleanliness. I'm a fan because Fresh & Easy now carries Magnolia Ice Cream in pint sizes! Magnolia is like Dreyers in the Philippines, it's the big leagues and they make the yummiest and creamiest ice cream in tropical fruit flavors, the Mango is a must and the Avocado is just mmmm good! So, stop by and grab some, there's no regret er maybe the calories but that's another matter! :P

Prior to me coming here, I would pass this place and scoff at their sidewalk board sign that claimed they served the "best breakfast burrito in downtown Phoenix". I mean seriously, it's an italian restaurant, so, why would they serve breakfast burritos?! Ok, I admit it, I was wrong and Focaccia Fiorentina's right they do serve the best breakfast burritos downtown. Get yourself the Twin Classic which are two burritos for $5. You get a choice of ham or bacon. The burrito isn't large but one burrito is satisfying enough but eating two wouldn't make you look greedy rather you'd be quite full, and could skip lunch. I usually get the Twin Classic with egg whites (no extra charge), I add spinach (dollar extra), no potatoes, and I get it with ham. The bacon is okay but the ham is yummy. Don't get there 15 minutes before 10:30 since they close up breakfast despite their sign saying they serve breakfast until 10:30 (it's a fib), anytime before that is fine and depending on the day expect a line because they're that good. Oh and avoid the coffee, One Coffee is across the street and worth it moreso than their pedestrian coffee that's no better than what's made in an office break room. Oh and the green salsa is worth it!

I gotta admit I'm liking my barhops around central Phoenix, there's plenty of great bars to hang out at and the Rose and Crown is no exception. Last night, I was hanging with my friends M and L and I was craving a pint of pilsner and the grilled cheese with tomato soup at the Roosevelt but sadly due to the really cold weather... and we got to Roosevelt at around 11sh... it was crowded and there were no empty tables... so I told my lady friends that we should check out the Rose and Crown and I'm glad we did!  Well... I could have gone to any bar like Lost Leaf or Carly's but I was also needing food... and I'm not sure what time the kitchen closes at Roosevelt either but found out the Rose and Crown pub, food ends at midnight. Loved the atmosphere,it's a converted house/cottage (very homey pun intended) with the front porch and the tables outside... too bad it was too cold, the heat lamps are great but I'd still be shivering (I was wearing a plaid shirt with a vest... yea not a good attire for the cold but I wanted to look good!). You step in and there's a bar straight ahead and you can either turn left to a pool table and another room with some tables, or right to a large room with a lone table and plenty of chairs with a flat screen and another room with a bar, three high tops and another nice flat screen. Service is prompt and the staff are friendly. Beer selection seems extensive but not as wide ranging as Roosevelt. I like that they ask how you like your snake bite understanding it's different in many places *nice touch*. The atmosphere is chill, laid back, you have a flat screen to enjoy a game. I ordered the fish and chips which were ordinary not bad though. And L got the grilled cheese which had tomato and bacon *yum*, she liked it. Both orders came with steak fries which were crunchy... not soggy... which is good. It's the pints that were good value... a pint of the sierra nevada celebration is like $3 and pint of snakebite is $5.50. so not bad at all. Overall I liked it and I will come back. see you again Rose and Crown.

I've been to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville elsewhere like in Grand Cayman and Cozumel and sadly this is the ugly cousin twice removed that exists only by name but not actuality.   went here on a friday night and was surprised to be wristbanded as tho it was a club but it wasn't. they had a tired dj and it was dimly lit. well my friends and I got ourselves a table coz our intention of goin to Margaritaville was to have dinner, after the Chocolate Affaire.   The menu was nothing special and really ordinary and prior to my visit to the awful excuse as a Margaritaville franchise the only things i've had are the margaritas and nachos. Anywho, ordered a bbq bacon cheeseburger asked it to be cooked medium, my friends ordered the chicken volcano nachos. The burger was alright, it wasn't that great and it was cooked well so a star was subtracted at first bite, the bun was a typical fast food burger bun, so another star, and the chicken volcano nachos though was a heaping serving of cheese chicken jalapenos pico and guac/sour cream it wasn't that good. so another star subtracted. i will not return and my overall experience left me disappointed. you fail margaritaville westgate that you actually don't deserve the name.

I simply adore their chai. it's sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...ooooooooo good! I love the spices are subtle, the taste not too sweet, and the overall hot chai is just delicious.   This is Tempe's Lux, yes it may not generate the cool from the outside that Lux on Central has but it's obscure locate behind a non-descript office plaza door makes it almost like a speak-easy for coffee lovers. It's an ooh and ah for the visual senses. Stepping into this shop makes it an awe experience, from the outside you do not realize that inside it's quite large, very artistic, visually appealing and yes they have many loyal patrons like myself. Their coffees are top notch, staff most helpful, and this is where hipsters come out in droves during certain nights that at times I feel as though I'm the weird one out in my clean cut jeans, graphic tee, samsung epic phone in hand get-up.   You must check out this shop, and I really doubt you'll come out underwhelmed rather I'm sure you'll agree that you just had a good cup of chai. =)

If it's lent or you're craving fish and chips then head over to TIm Finnegans for a black velvet pint and an order of AYCE fish fry for $13! that  can't be beat. Oh and it's good fish and chips, the sad part is that it's hefty so unless you're really just craving alot of fish, you'll only be able to handle one serving of fish and chips that it'll be too hard to stomach a second plate. The pub has character, and on Fridays usually later in the evening they have live music. Overall a good pub to hang out, have some fish and chips, drink some pints of black velvet (for me) and have a good time!

Three things make Geisha A Go Go my go to place in Old Town for happy hour... 3 things... and they are -  Teriyaki Ribs (oh my!)  Hello Kitty (sake martini/cocktail of oh so yummy strawberry like goodness)  and.... (drum roll please...)  All night happy hour on Sundays from 3p til 2am.   What kind of happy hour you ask? half off appetizers, of which the Teriyaki Ribs are part of... half of maki/house rolls and half off (insert angels singing in unison here.) half off all drinks in house. yes you heard that right, half off u-call its, specialty drinks, sake bombers, sake infusion drinks... i'm telling you it's heaven for the Sunday lush!  So, why should you go other than the three things listed above? Because when you have a hankering to end the week with good times or start the week in a drunken daze this my yelpers is the place to go. The atmosphere is great, good music, good vibes, good drinks, music videos to watch, oh and yummy teriyaki ribs to scarf down, oh and good eye candy, girls and boys alike to secretly check out. Oh, and if you have a big group make sure to reserve a table for groups 10 or more coz it's crowded by 5. and when they say the wait time is at least an hour, believe it coz no ones leaving a good happy hour at Geisha! deuces!

Geisha HH Sundays cannot be beat... I am officially a Geisha groupie/whore coz i love this place! The music's always HAPPENING and the drinks are plenty cheap and constantly a-pouring, I swear if I could choose my heaven I think Geisha would be it... (hmmm that can either mean i wanna party it up or I am that crassy?)! Anywho, I celebrated my birthday at Geisha last October and got myself the largest karaoke room available to fit my guestlist of 20. Now, they say that the room can fit 20 but I think they fail to mention... maybe 20 skinny Japanese not 20 american adults. lol. I got the room for half price since my bday was on a sunday (i later found out and not sure if it has always been but you can get a karaoke room free on your bday, score! not for me =( )   Anyways, karaoke room at half off with some free apps, and a server that handled my group's orders, and with all day hh going on and 2 hours of fun and bad singing = hella good fun! I loved that the total of the bill split amongst people came out to around $210 excl. the room, lots of cocktails were had and soooooooooo many orders of teriyaki ribs. And this is why I adore Geisha, the apps don't suck, the rolls are yummy, the drinks delicious and the atmosphere cannot be beat. I always rave about this place and I think the consequence is that this place gets even more crowded every Sun I come here. still in love with you Geisha!!

this is a seat yourself place, you walk in, find a table and wait. Now, sometimes you'll get a nice, smart server, and other times you'll get a server who serves up attitude, and doesn't refill your lemonade and tells you that you don't get refills but that's another story.   The menu is extensive, lots of different breakfast options, there's also plenty of lunch options too, and don't forget to check out the large specials board. Servings are substantial, eats are tasty, and price is fair. This is one of my rotation breakfast places after a morning hike.

I did not know that it's larger than it seems BUT I enjoyed the fact that it was so accessible to get to. Part of it is in the parking lot of a shopping complex and the rest of it goes across central ave and down the street. Stop by Grinders Coffee house for live music, and just check out the different artisan vendors. Atmosphere is great as well as the overall vibe!

YUM to all things creative and delicious!!! I'm finally on the Sweet Republic bandwagon and clearly a fan... and yes I have seen the Sweet Republic light!   I love the creative flavors chocolate guinness, white rose, jalapeno avocado, mango lassi, the cheese duo, and the cashew turtle... the ladies of Sweet Republic are a creative duo and we Phoenicians are SOsoSOso lucky to have them! YUM!   Got myself a triple scoop of white rose, cheese duo and belgian choco...YUMyumYUMyum!!! and a pint of the jalapeno avocado, and the cashew turtle. Why pints? Well I live in awesome Chandler and North Scottsdale is a drive away... I know my distances and I'd rather head to Arcadia/Biltmore than North Scottsdale, it's FAR! I did get to find something out for us Sweet Republic lovers here in Chandler that the Chandler Wholefoods will be selling by the scoop 20 flavors of Sweet Republic brand at the in store gelato shop... so exciting!  I'm glad I finally got to try it and when I find myself in the area again, I'm gonna make sure to stop by!

As for chain restos, the Keg is a good happy hour go to. The happy hour may be limited but what they offer is substantial. I believe it's 5 or 6 small plates, and discounted house wines and draft beers from 4pm to 7pm. I usually work until 6pm on Fridays and the Keg is a 15 min drive from work, so, it makes a good hh meeting spot for my friends and I. I gotta compliment them on the Keg Dogs which is a hh item. It's served as 3 small hot dogs or the hot dog version of sliders topped with sweet chili. It's quite tasty and can be filling depending on your appetite, have a glass of wine or two, and it's a great start to a Friday evening.

There are times i wish we had a Thaitown or there was a cluster of really good Thai restaurants within a 5 mile drive of me but sadly most Thai places in metro Phoenix are just not that good with exception of a few gems. One gem is Thai Elephant. This review is based solely on the service I received ordering take out and the food itself.  I'm usually against ordering take out at a new establishment simply because it doesn't allow you to properly judge the place. Some places food just don't do well with takeout... like dim sum. So it's best to try out a place to get the full taste before coming back to take out home. Thai Elephant proved that its food was take out capable. It's been cold lately so I had a hankering for some curry to warm me up. I was ordering enough food for three people. I ordered some Tom Kha (coconut based soup), a seafood yellow curry, a chicken panang curry (red curry) and some Tofu Pad Pik King (stir fry green bean, bell pepper and spicy chili paste). The three entrees were all ordered HOT, and the Tom Kha was Thai HOT.  Take out service was usual, was given a menu to peruse, the hostess was patient and answered my questions and gave recommendations. The overall appearance of the restaurant was that it was somewhat largish, and tastefully decorated. This is not dirty kitchen Thai in anyway unlike the really good ones in Thaitown but the menu was quite extensive and prices were moderate too.   Food-wise this is one of the better Thai restaurants around. The yellow curry was delicious, I couldn't get enough of it, I kept on slurping the sauce. The Tom Kha was excellent that they did not kid with the spicy factor, loved it! It wasn't salty, no msg used, and the ingredients were fresh! My parents are hard to please when it comes to Thai especially since many of their close friends are Thai so they know what Thai food should taste like, so to hear them tell me that they want to buy from Thai Elephant in the future is proof of how they liked it.   Overall, Thai Elephant is a winner and a place that I'd like to come back to and have dinner at with friends. I loved what I ordered and I'm sure whoever I'm with, will too! If you're ever in Tempe, I recommend you stop by Thai Elephant if you're ever craving Thai cuisine!

Like most Macy's with the exception of the one in nyc, Macy's is an upgraded J.C. Penney's with great sales, fashions, and friendly staff. I gotta admit most of my wardrobe has been bought at Macy's all due to great weekly sales and phenomenal holiday sales. It's my go to department store and a recommendation for many. =)

Oh Mojo you won my heart from day one... I always thought I was a gelato spot kinda guy but no apparently I can swing both ways. But if Mojo and Gelato Spot were in a heavyweight championship of how to retain best customers, Mojo has won round one. Why? Simply because of the awesomest event that runs every week on a Tuesday of which I love and that is Twitter Tuesdays! On this day and as an avid Mojo twitter follower, I am rewarded *that's what I think* for my fan-ship and loyalty with a fun secret word of which I made aware of the day of, and upon learning the secret word, drive after work to the Mill Ave location and get myself some Mojo fro-yo goodness for half-off! Score!! =) =)   I just love that at this location there are 14 flavors available to sample, and mix and create the best combinations ever! Oh, and the many toppings and mix-ins make the experience enjoyable! Love getting myself a cup of lemon fro-yo with a tinge of strawberry fro-yo topped off with blueberries -delish- on and birthday cake with choc fro yo mixed in with almonds, peanuts, and choco pebbles... OMG! Yes... I love you Mojo... I am a fan!

I'm a yelp FAN-atic and I usually expect the best experience when I'm trying out a yelp reviewed established that has earned a good amount of great reviews. Ok, maybe in this case four reviews was really taking a chance on a new place but I was brave.   I live in South Chandler, work in Phoenix, and tend to have most of my fun in CenPho. Honestly I love that downtown has neighborhoods with character, unique shops, and trendy hold up on their own restaurants to boot! Anywho, I went to Moira last night with some expectations, mainly a place for good sushi (to satisfy my sushi craving this week), enjoy a martini or two, and to have an amazing experience (well, amazing has only happened once, and that was FEZ).   I went with three other friends, two of whom are sushi lovers and another that enjoys three things at sushi joints and that is, veggie tempura, a california roll or something like that, and an eel roll of sorts. Anywho, from the outside, Moira it looked cool, very urban chic on a quiet street. The hostess was really nice and the layout was how it was described in the other reviews, very modern with the whole urban feel. I don't know but the bar area reminded me like a pei wei setup, and the whole leaning buddha frames seemed out of place.   With the ambience in place, I was looking forward to my sushi experience, so we waited at our table, and waited a few more, and waited... to the point of after 15 minutes of not getting any waters or seeing any sign of a server coming up to us, my antsy friends were asking me if I knew any other sushi place we could go to in the area. Oh maybe I should note the time we first sat down, it was 7:25PM. And the restaurant was somewhat busy, a large number of tables were filled, and it was really cold.   Finally we were served water of which our server asked out drink orders and appetizers. We got ourselves an order of the calamari and the veggie tempura. then we waited... I have to admit we got our drink orders quite quick, I'd say 15 mins tops followed with our apps. The calamari in my opinion tasted interesting. My friend, S. described it as tasting like kung pao sauce with calamari it was sweet, yet had a little spice with red peppers, some mushrooms, onions. It's not a calamari that I would want to try again but it wasn't bad either. The veggie tempura was basic, some baby corn, yam, the usual in tempura batter, nothing special nothing unique. So let's talk about sushi.   S. and I shared three rolls, they were the spicy yellowftail, the jade, and the zu. D. had the geisha and the eel cucumber. We were hungry and after eating our mediocre apps, we waited and waited, ok let's say service was slooooowwwwwww and when you have slow service and hungry sushi craving people, tempers flare and what was supposed to be a great dining experience suddenly becomes a bad one.   When your server drops off hamachi yellowtail sashimi on the house because of the long wait, you know service is slow, and when you are told "I'm sorry for the wait but we only have two sushi chefs in the back and alot of orders" you know it's poor prep, and therefore slow service.   The hamachi sashimi was good but who serves sashimi without wasabi and sushi without wasabi and ginger? Apparently Moira does. And honestly why would I the customer have to ask a server at a sushi place for wasabi and ginger, I would think that's a basic requirement. So we waited close to 25 odd minutes for my friend D's rolls which were the geisha and the eel cucumber... 10mins later came our first roll the Jade, 10mins later the Zu.... and then my friend A. who ordered Sashimi and Negari, her oder came in 15 mins after. As you can see our orders didn't even come close to each other, so instead of us enjoying our meal together, it was like watching one person eat while the others waited. We finally got our last roll, the spicy yellowtail 20 mins after A.'s order. And got our check at 9:10PM. I enjoy a leisurely dinner when I'm out with friends but something I choose to have and not because a restaurant's poor service is forcing me to have a loooong dinner.   Alright sushi not phenonmenol sushi accompanied by a slow inattentive service made my night out at Moira not that great. Servers should attempt to check on their customers every so often, I feel that they seemed shorthanded given it was a Wed. evening but still that is no excuse for slow service. I don't believe I'll come back to Moira again. I just felt shortchanged that something with promise could have turned out for the best but in this instance it marred my sushi night out. it's a thumbs down for Moira.

This is how I'll rank my 24 hour fitness experiences and will be ranked - hotness (true eye workout), hottt (pleasing eye workout) and spicy (eye workout)... yea yea i'm shallow.   This ladies, gays, and gents is what happens if ASU decided to open a corporate gym you end up with 24 hour fitness at Riverview. It seems at times during peak periods that the ASU greeks, kens and barbies come out in force to "workout" or workout and be around their kind. This gym is the first in many years that I felt intimitated by not having that hot bod, no, this isn't just hot bod central, this is the gym you avoid if you're trying to melt away the fat and keep to your nye resolution.   Anywho the gym itself is a gem mainly coz it's still pretty new and has really nice equipment, it's organized, has cool ellipticals and weight machines and just looks visually nice. So, with nice machines, hot bods, it makes the eye workout so enjoyable that it's a treat during my cardio days. lol.   Oh and it's rank - HOTNESS!

unlike my partner in crime Sara V. I'm gonna refrain from giving Bacon a complete five star.   Last Sunday after a fun night out, I had mentioned to Sara V. that we meet up for brunch the next day, something that we ought to do more of since there are quite a large number of breakfast establishments in metro Phoenix. The original plan was to meet for brunch at Arcadia farms but I had woken up late from my slightly drunken stupor... so brunch became early lunch... we had breakfast so therefore was still brunch... so as a last minute change of plans of which I am infamous of doing, I changed the venue to Bacon. I've been reading reviews on the place both here on Yelp and the Phoenix New Times and it's one of the places I've listed on my list as a potential must try.   So we met at Bacon and I was running late as usual... and after being told by Sara that it was directly behind Devil's South, which she did not kid... you'll miss it but it's right behind Devil's across from Vidal Sassoon on Goldwater. I loved the fact that I could park my car and sneak through the open windows into the restaurant... it's awesome! The layout is quite spacious... love the booths as well as the picture perfect white kitchen table. It's so open and airy and the tables are not bunched up together at all. Upon sitting, I was greeted by our server, Jessica who was a breath of fresh air. She was pleasant, and totally helpful... loved her! She totally understood the coffee with lots of cream or how she described as a cup of cream with a smidgen of coffee hehehe. I ordered, The Canuck, which is an english muffin sandwich with melted gruyere cheese, canadian bacon, and a scrambled egg. Think of it as glorified egg mcmuffin but way better. We also ordered a half order of the French Toast with the raspberry jam. The sandwich was delicious... loved the Canadian bacon... could care less for the english muffin but the gruyere cheese was yum! Loved it! As for the French Toast, I was disappointed it... was not too sweet but it was quite average. My coffee was so good that usually when I'm out somewhere having breakfast I usually only go for two cups but i had at least 3 cups, and a cup to go. So my overall experience was that I enjoyed what I ordered minus the french toast therefore losing a star to make it five. And I agree with Sara V that it's one of the breakfast places to come back to... Arcadia Farms you're next!

Sometimes you've got to satisfy your spam musubi cravings, luckily for me there's an Ono's close to my work and I'm able to get me a spam musubi fix. MMMMmmmm for spam musubi, spam and sticky rice with teriyaki sauce wrapped in a seaweed roll... yum yum! And with my spam musubi i usually get the curry chicken katsu... with a scoop of rice and two scoops of macaroni salad... it makes for a good plate lunch altho it's a tad pricey, wish it was slightly cheaper. But we're aways from the islands and plus this Californian chain is not really from Hawaii but it's still good stuff! Totally recommend if you're craving spam musubi and some katsu, it satisfies and spam is just yum!

So at one time my friend, Sara and I used to have a certain gripe that we hadn't found a go to restuarant whenever we found ourselves in an indecisive debacle of where to have dinner... lo and behold we have found our spot and that's Gallo Blanco! *yay* okay and FEZ which is still dear to my heart is on same footing as well *who can beat those yummy cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries?* But I digress... anywho, why am I in love with Gallo Blanco? Well folks it's simply because I love their guacamole with it's mandarin citrus intermingled within the guac, the OMG so delicious tortilla chips that are crunchy and crispy and just YUM, and the chicharron de queso... OH who can pass up fried cheese with their aji aioli... oh dios mio!  Apart from the ridiculously sexy appetizers that alone are just hot, like victoria secret angel hot, the Cochinita  (yes, I capitalized it because it deserves it!) is the torta that I want as part of my last meal if ever I find myself on death row or waiting for the impending destruction of the world whichever comes first... meh. Anywho this pork torta had me at first bite... totally in amor with it! why? the pork is soooooooo tender and make sure you get it with fried egg layered with the avocado slices... I haven't had a sandwich that good... ok maybe the FEZ burger or the delux turkey burger. The meat is so good that when it falls out you just have to pick it up and eat it coz you don't want to waste perfectly good meat... DAMN! So yea... the cochinita and the guac are reasons alone to head out to Gallo Blanco, a true gem in the cenpho dining scene!

So yesterday as I was sitting at my desk salivating about getting myself a Naco Torta at Gallo Blanco, then picked up Sara debating on whether to go to Ticoz or Gallo Blanco, we found ourselves at the Parlor. I have to admit, what I was craving was nowhere close to where we ended up with but both Sara and I have always wanted to try out the Parlor after hearing so many good things about it that we finally did it and I am glad! whew!   So, first impressions - It's a Wednesday night, parking lot is full which is always a good sign, the entrance with the fireplace facing the patio, and the smell of pizza wafting from the kitchen sets up a good evening for dining out. The host staff were quite friendly (no attitudes there *yay*), and the chalk board on the wall with their daily specials looked good. I have to say that the overall interiors of this place is so comfy, yet spacey... I just love it!   I ordered a blueberry shake because I saw it as one of their fruit specials of the day plus I read somewhere that it's good for men's health and I also needed my calcium too! And we also ordered the frito misto which I agree with others was not that great... it was good but the portion was too small but just right for two persons. So, Sara and I were deciding on what pizzas we'd get to share, so we settled on the Yukon Gold Potato and the Salsiccia.   Between the two pizzas we shared... I totally loved the Yukon... it was just yummy!!! loved the potato and the Gorgonzola and the leeks mmmmmmm! The Salsiccia was good, the sausage was yum but the radish totally screwed with your taste buds. It had a bitter taste that totally reminded me of arugula but nonetheless it was good. Loved the crust... it was crisp and loved the toasted burnt taste. So here we were satisfied with our pizza selections, enjoyed the attentive service of our many servers, took in the atmosphere of the place, and I kept on eyeing the dolci people were ordering around us. I know I know I should have ordered the Tiramisu but when your server tells you that they have an in-house pastry chef and sells the apple crostada and mentions her other favorite is the chocolate cake, one's reaction would be is to listen to the recommendation and go for the apple crostada. SO we did, we gave in and got ourselves the crostada. I will liken this review to a potential break up scene in which a couple goes on a date and everything seems fine and well until the guy or girl gets caught flirting with another brad or buffy next door... what starts as a good evening gets muzzled up with a bad incident well let's say this bad incident was the crostada. Mind you, I am not in any way an exceptional baker but I admit to being a fan of the best pastries ever presented to me thanks to close family friends, a husband and wife team that are pastry chefs themselves and work in two top tier international hotels. Like what Sara said, that crostada was not a flaky pastry... it was like bread with an apple topping. I liked it since it wasn't that sweet but the apples were too tart and with a dry crust, the only thing to enjoy was the scoop of vanilla gelato. So a no go with the crostada and sadly I was disappointed by the in-house pastry chef... maybe next time I'll get the Tiramisu.   So overall, it was a good experience at the Parlor, a place that I can see myself returning in the near future with friends and family. The dessert was not memorable in any way except that it was dry and I can't wait to try out the other pizzas or the Seafood Linguine. So four forks for the Parlor!

I went back a second time to The Parlor for my parent's birthday on a Friday evening. I had attempted to call ahead to make a reservation but was dismayed to hear that they did not accept reservations. Knowing it was a Friday, and it was a first Friday, and early December... there would be a wait. So, I made sure to show up at The Parlor to secure a table or at least get my name on the list for my party of ten. I know the parking lot of The Parlor is quite small for a restaurant of its size so I wasn't surprised they would have a valet service like LGO, and knowing it was complimentary was worth it making parking less of a hassle. Placed my name on the list and was told it would be an hr wait for a table.   Despite the confusion of names, and hosts trying to locate patrons, my party was seated a little past the hour wait. Family was impressed by the place and I kept on raving about the food. We ordered the soup of the day, a bruschetta, the cauliflower granita and the frito misto. The soup of the day was this roasted sweet corn bisque that was exquisite, the bruschetta was delicious, never got to try the cauliflower granita but heard it was really good, and the frito misto was above average. As for entrees, our server was awesome in getting all our orders right. We ordered, the funghi, the salsiccia, the pepperoni, and the yukon gold potato, the duck club, the summer corn risotto and the seafood linguini. If I were to rank the pizzas in descending preference from excellent to good because none are bad... they're all yum. On top is the salsiccia, the funghi, the pepperoni and the yukon. The summer corn risotto was my least favorite, it was quite bland. The seafood linguini had a spicy kick to it which surprised us all but the pasta was delicious! And the duck club is like the best club out there, the duck is delicious, and oh so tender!   We had asked our server if the Parlor did anything special for birthday celebrations and was told, that a complimentary slice of the italian chocolate cake was given complete with candles. So knowing we'd all get a taste of the chocolate cake, we also ordered the tiramisu. We were all surprised that it was not just a slice but a freaking big slice to say the least and that chocolate cake is DELICIOSO!!! Topped with fresh whip, and lots of whip, and the chocolate was so moist, not too sweet and inside it had black cherries... just thinking of it makes me want to stop by later for a slice... it's GOOD!!! and the Tiramisu has to be one of the best tiramisu's i've had, just as good as the one back in North Beach in Little Italy SF. The pine nut topping was bomb it was a boom boom pow with the tastebuds! Both desserts were a great finish to a very satisfying meal, and it seems my family will return in the future. Can't wait for my return visit soon!

I went with friends to Westgate Center after a mediocre dinner at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, we were wanting to check out the different bars in the center, and came upon McFadden's, it had a line, and it seemed to be happening, so we waited 5 minutes and got in, i was surprised i had to pay a $5 cover but i was okay with that and expected it to be crowded inside but was dismayed that it was only half full, it smelled like dried puke, and it was a total skeeze! ick!   most of the crowd looked bad, and the bar girls in their skimpy outfits did not deserve to wear the outfit. Skimpy isn't bad as long as you fit the image, and these girls did not. Skimpy uniforms work in tempe and old town because you have women that look good for the most part. here the bargirls were tatted up and just didn't look right. Oh and what's with throwing napkins up in the air to act as confetti? it's stupid, and messy, and so the overall appearance of this bar is that it's dirty, with napkins on the floor, spilled beer, some weird funky pukey smell, and the oddest looking crowd. part of me wished i got my $5 back because that was a $3 experience or less. oh and the music was just bad. this is where djs with very little experience must play and practice their skills.   so, to sum it up, it's a hole, and if this is one of the hottest spots Westgate has to offer then someone must have punk'd me coz this is a true joke.

On a whim on a late thursday and after a hardcore session of dance central which further aggravated my sick state (a cold and horrible sore throat), I asked a friend to join me on a late evening jaunt to try out the Petite Maison. I remember reading somewhere whether it was on Chow Bella or from a yelper that Petite Maison hosts what they call staff meals. A staff meal is their late night menu that permits their chef or visiting chef to come up with a simple menu that showcases simplicity and deliciousness. The late night menu offered never changes but there are 3 items on the side bar of the late night menu, which is the staff meal that changes and can be found out the day of if you follow PetiteMaisonAZ on twitter.   Anywho, I saw on twitter what was gonna be served thurs. night, it was Oaxaca style dogs, Pork Verde enchiladas and the red cup was "Spring Fever". My dinner partner and myself were game, so we drove over and came upon one of the cutest establishments Phoenix/Scottsdale has to offer, it's so quaint and I love the patio and the indoor bar set up. Walking through the hedges transports you to a different world away. Anywho, we got to choose where to sit and were excited to try the staff meal. I ordered the Oaxaca Style dogs with the jalapeño potato side and my friend D got the Pork Verde Enchiladas and we share the Pomme Frites with the malt vinegar aoli.   The Oaxaca Style dogs hit the spot with me, there were two large dogs that were served with a goat cheese, jalapeno peppers, and spicy bbq bean type sauce, in a sense simply DELICIOUS. and the potato salad complemented the meal since as D mentioned, provides a contrast with the hot and cold of the plate. The enchiladas were lacking a spicy kick, although good this lack of spice made the dish not as yummy as it should have been. And the pomme frites, for a $5 portion it was quite good, albeit a tad too crispy for my liking and the aoli is something that I would order again. Overall our staff meal was enjoyable and Petite Maison will be one of the restaurants to go to if we're craving something late night, and plus none of the staff meal entrees are over $10 so it's totally worth it. Beats diner food, oh and staff meals run on thurs, fri. and sat. nights from 10p to midnight.

I heard about Donna's through New Times and Yelp. It's not common to have an Asian bakery open up  here in Phoenix but after hearing of the many delights they offer at low prices, I knew I had to check this place out!  My first visit I tried the bbq pork bun, the pork sung bun, the curry beef pastry, the bbq pork pastry and a slice of the jasmine green tea. The bbq pork bun, the curry beef and the bbq pastry reminded me of the pastries i would eat in Singapore, and in LA at a bakeshop i go to in Rosemead. It wasn't dry, and it was very good. The Pork Sung is pretty much dried pork pieces on a bun so it's an acquired taste something I'm not a fan of, so, I can really comment on that and to be fair I'm not sure if it's really that good. As for the Jasmine Green Tea cake, I think that's what they're good at, cakes. It was delicious, not sweet, and not bland but just right, hence I made the decision that I had to buy my brother's bday cake from their bakery.   We made a last minute to order his bday cake the day of and I pleaded my case with them if they could make an exception for the black forest cake but they said they were unable to make his cake within a day at such short notice but mentioned that they had 5 types of mousse cakes that they could whip up in a few hours. So we chose a 10 inch Passion fruit mousse cake, it was like $30. Thought it was a tad pricey but when we all had a slice, and when we saw it, it was WORTH it. Simply delicious, simply yummy. Loved the fruit and presentation, and again not overly sweet, just right. I like that the prices are low, and they're not overcharging for their snack items and sandwiches. The cakes are worth it and I'm looking forward to the day when I'll order my birthday cake, and this time I'm ordering the black forest, a week before just to be sure!

I've once again made this location my primary gym over the Riverview location since I have started working out in the mornings prior to work. The last time I reviewed this place, most of the cardio machines worked as they should have but that was more than a year ago. Amazingly that's all it takes, a year, for everything to turn for the worst. It seems at this location, I end up having to play treadmill roulette except in this version, no one dies. My workout routine consists of cardio first thing followed by heavy strength training. Here, despite having a large number of treadmills and ellipticals in reality there are far less than one can see. How so? Because in treadmill roulette, you end up getting on a machine and hope for the best. It usually entails getting on one treadmill, the closest to the entrance, step on it, check the digi pad and find out it doesn't work. it's the treadmill shuffle too, and here are the steps: get on machine, check out pad, it doesn't work, step to the right, get on machine check out pad, it doesn't work, repeat... and once you find a working machine... cardio it up with some pizazz, HU HAH! jazz hands and spirit fingers! Yea, that's my main complaint, all the free weights and machine weights are fine but everything else is a MEH. What I pay in dues makes me wonder why machines are so hard to be repaired and upgraded at this facility, heck the YMCA for the most part has more working cardio machines than here, so what gives, corporate 24 hour fitness?! get back to me. Thanks! Overall though my two stars are to the free weights, machine weights and their morning staff. =)

Thanks to Sara V. I learned about Total Wine & More through her and when i heard they were opening up locations in Phoenix, I was excited. Anywho, 6 visits later, I can honestly say I'm a fan of total wine and moreso than BevMo. I love that there's a wide selection of wines from all over. My favorites are Riesling, Moscato, Rose, Pinot Noirs and sparkling wines. Yes, I love the sweet kinds.  Anywho, my most recent visit, had me buying two kinds of Rieslings both recommended, a Bree and the other one a German Riesling. I recently had Moscato the night before and loved, it was sweet like apple cider and very flavor, with it's apple and peach undertones...simply delish! The Bug Juice Moscato was YUM and elegant. I totally enjoy the selection not just for wines but for beers as well. I like that I can by some hoegardaan for cheap and I like the wine tastings going on. The staff's helpful and overall I like the layout and the prices!

As a Filipino in Phoenix it's hard to find Filipino restaurants in Phoenix especially Tagalog Filipino cooking. Most Filipinos in Phoenix are illocano or Visayan and there really isn't alot of Filipino restaurants to try so when my mom and I saw a banner outside of Mekong Plaza of a Filipino grill that just opened, I made sure that the next time I found myself at Mekong I'd stop and try it out. Anywho, Wholly Grill is owned by a Cebuana, and they specialize in grilling hence the name. There are usually two things I'll try out at a Filipino restaurant and that is their barbeque and the house special. In this case it was the pork barbeque and the Liempo (grilled pork belly). Chona the owner was pulling out all the stops to get people to try out her place hence the 4 stars coz she was giving out samples. The barbeque was not sweet which was good and not too saucy! I think that's what people are not big fans of and that's sugar sweet filipino food. The Liempo was not fatty nor salty and with the 2 scoops of rice and the macaroni salad (pinoy style with the raisins) along with two pork bbq sticks for around $10 it wasn't a bad deal. I just wish she had sago or Halo-Halo. But it's not bad, and if I need a Filipino fix I'll stop by at Wholly Grill! you should too!

I'm biased when it comes to the Y since I've been a member off and on since 2000. I've been lucky whenever I've signed up with the YMCA that I've been able to get good deals such as having the sign up fee waived and so forth. The Chandler/Gilbert YMCA in particular has grown quite abit. At one time the facility was quite small and limited with the amount of free weight facilities as well as their machine weight selection but now it has been expanded to fit two large rooms with a good selection of stationary bikes, treadmills, and elliptical machines. This location is smaller than other YMCAs in the valley because of this you get to know the trainers and the front desk staff a little more to the point that they know when you usually come in and greet you on a first name basis. It's a little weird at first but after a while being greeted with a smile, a hello, and them saying your name is a comforting exchange. The facility hours are not that great on weekends since on Saturdays, they close at 6PM and on Sundays at 4PM but that's the advantage of a YMCA gym membership and that you're not limited to the facility you signed up with, you're able to use your membership at other Y locations, for me that is the Tempe Y or the Ahwatukee Y. So if you'd like that community feel gym where you're not treated just as a customer but as an actual member worth remembering, the Chandler YMCA or the YMCA in general is good for you!

What i love about this store is how it caters to filipino goods. Instead of an aisle reserved to filipino products and goods this place has it all over the place. Some of the stuff they sell here are cheaper than Lee Lee and their produce selection is extensive and in an organized and clean setting.   The drawback of this store is the rice selection which isn't as varied as well as the beer too. Lee Lee has all kinds of Asian lagers, this store lacks the San Miguel dark lager. Nevertheless there's still a good selection. The fish here is just as good as Lee Lee though and it's nice to get the packaged smoked eel and the seaweed salad. Unlike other Asian grocery stores this one has piped in music, and organized aisles. Overall this place is worth shopping at and can compete with Lee Lee.

It's my 100th review!!! yay!   Went here yesterday afternoon for linner it was originally supposed to be a late lunch but my timeliness plus my dinner date's class ending late past 3:30p and traffic on the 101 north coming from tempe made our 4p meeting switch to 5p. Found the place on the left side if going westbound on shea after scottsdale road.  It's always nice to see a good friend especially if you haven't seen them awhile, it makes for great conversation especially over soup, we ordered a bowl of tom yum koong. Now, in other places tom yum is made with lime amongst other things that make this hot and sour soup so fragrant and delicious but this version lacked the limes and in its place were tomatoes and onions. interesting combination. In the broth was plenty of lemongrass, and galangal root, oh, and I must commend them for the amount of shrimp in the bowl, there was plenty, i think between the two of us we both had at least 6 pieces of shrimp. yum!  Honestly what peeved me with this thai restaurant was their lack of lime! It's a simple ingredient necessary for either bringing down the heat of the spice or enhancing the flavor. Michelle my dinner date asked me what I would rate this establishment, and the lack of lime gives this place not a true 4 but like a 3.75. We ordered pad thai, and asked for cilantro as an accompaniment to the noodles to add more flavor, and a chicken green curry. BOTH came in large portions, the pad thai was okay not the best but not bad either, next time i'll try the Pad Se Ew. The green curry was delish, loved the curry and the taste of basil. We had plenty of leftovers and our servers were helpful and available. Overall it was a great dining experience. A must eat/try in the shea corridor.

Carmel Bianca!!! Oh my Effin Gosh... that's the stuff! It's yum. I'm a fan of white chocolate flavored coffee so maybe I'm bias and why I simply enjoyed my 16oz of Carmel Bianca goodness. It's simply espresso, steamed milk, white chocolate and carmel drizzled on top. And that's the signature drink of Dolce Espresso.  Thanks to Yelp I decided last night after a driving lesson with L that I was too tired to drive home without something to pick me up... and that was reason enough to make the short trek to Dolce because I've always wanted to try it. Wasn't exactly sure where it was, and happy to find that it's just across from Padre's next to a Psychic place. Dolce has a cool vibe with music videos playing. And they're good songs too... like I had never seen Pitbull's "The Anthem" video... liked it! Enjoyed my Carmel Bianca with a slice of their Chicago Style Cheesecake. I liked the cheesecake because it was different in taste compared to other cheesecakes, it was like a marzipan with cheese frosting on top... so it was interesting. Not really a fan of the German Choc that my friends K and D got. I thought it was dry... yuck!   It's a small place that's bright, with four flat screens spread about. The owner, Cesar (I think) was a sweetheart! I just hope Dolce survives as a 24 hour cafe on weekends because this place has potential. It's way better than counterculture cafe back in the day. This is like the best place to go after the bars if you need a pick me up before heading home to the eastside from central Phoenix. Prices are moderate. SO pls check this place out and spread the word... love it and I'll be back!

So there was a time when I had no idea who or what Jimmy John's was. I mean unless you're from the midwest or somewhere central I doubt coasters and those of us in between had ever heard of this awesome sub place. I'd like to think my encounter with Jimmy John's was fate... although through unusual circumstances, a story for another time ;-) my first try was a complimentary sample by a certain gentleman... well the thing is i kind of forgot his name... oops! That first time... I got to try the #5 Vito. It was a mouthful, he never told me it was that big, and so thick but my first bite into it I handled it like a champ, and I just kept on eating it and swallowing until it was all done, I was satisfied, and afterwards I made a mental note that I would return because I was craving more.   I've only had two menu items and that's the #5 and the #11 both delicious creations, I can't explain the bread, it's a white sub but it's really good. They don't toast it, I like the contrast of a cold loaf with a hot filling... in the end it's a good feeling. And the times they are open make them especially awesome! Phoenix now has become a late night city with a little more places open past 10p and I love Jimmy John's for that, now after a late night on mill ave and kinda buzzed from the tavern... I have choices other than the mill staples of Slices, the hot dog place, well basically the stretch of late night food places on 6th ave. Now I can walk to Jimmy's and grab a yum sub! So love ya and yes I'm a fan... thanks my mr.-stery  encounter for introducing me to Jimmy's... and I'll see ya again Jimmy John's for my #5!

Upon entering I muttered under my breath, "we're no longer in Tempe, Toto..." Yes, there are times I imagine I'm Dorothy with some red ruby slippers prancing down the yellow brick road/sidewalk but seriously who doesn't?! Sadly, I didn't have a dog alongside me, and ummm my Toto reference was imaginary, hmmm come to think of it, why do I have a Dorothy in Wonderland fantasy?? wait, focus. Okay, so went in and I was like, wow, this sure isn't like their Tempe location which is unassuming in a strip mall plaza, with nary a window but a door while here it's windows galore, and inside is... I just don't know how to describe it... hipster chic? I mean they had a red chandelier that was hanging low touching the floor, and a deer's head stuck on the wall with a black and white theme BUT the ubiquitous Cartel menu boards hung behind the counter, and somehow the overall interior tied it all in. Anyways, I came for their Chai which still resonates as one of the best places to get one, and it still is. I do like that they have pastries to snack on. Just happy that Cartel is close to me at work, anyways I got to figure my whole Dorothy thing, that's another story.

late night fun with bridge, marcus and dani.  ah, Culinary Dropout, Old Town never fails at 1) a good time 2) an awesome dining/drinking experience 3) consistent good service 4) yummy pretzel bites with a delish cheese fondue and 5) one of the best desserts in Phoenix, their awesome monkey bread!  I love the overall vibe of this place and no matter the countless repeated visits to this location, I love their patio, the varying chandeliers, the comfy chairs and diversity of sizes, and just the look of the place. It's not trying hard with the cool factor. I haven't been dismayed once with bad service (yet.) and I hope never, and not once have I seen their host staff give on an upturned nose attitude. Kudos for that.   I totally recommend the pretzel bites it's yum! I've had the same bites at Arrogant Butcher and for some odd reason Culinary's is best. The baked mussels is good as well. Entree wise, I do enjoy their fish and chips, as well as their fried chicken, and no complaints of the bistro steak but seriously it's not worth more than $20. But don't miss out on the monkey bread, that's like coke, it's addictively good. =P Oh, and when they're crowded just try to avoid sitting near the stage, let's just say, head nods and smiles will be the focal point of your dinner conversation and you oughta brush up on lip reading. Overall a good place. =)

This is the fourth pita jungle location I've been to, and I must say this location beats out the Chandler location in terms of character, and overall atmosphere. Now, the Chandler Pita Jungle may have a "lake" view but this one is set in the middle of the very artsy and picturesque Roosevelt neighborhood. Its setting alone yells out sophisticated urban space. The large windows facing the street, the whole exposed air ducts/loft look and the large mirror with the kitschy frame made of various radios and stuff - love it! now, as for the food, what can I say? I love pita jungle for what their menu offers, and I am boring when it comes to Pita Jungle coz my usuals are hummus, their garlic potatoes (yum!), the Chicken Shwarma plate, and my ultimate fave their Chicken Pasta Salad (rotini pasta, with grilled chicken and sliced tomatoes) boring eh? So, I decided to change it up, and this time I got the Chicken del Sol, it's more of a stew of sorts with chicken pieces and stewed tomatoes and a cheddar lavosh crisp as an accompaniment. It was good, loved the taste and flavor but I really felt they went overkill with the tomatoes, it  was a tomato filled dish that really became too much that i started hating what i ordered. =( Chances of me getting it again is a possibility, maybe I'll ask for less tomatoes, but me coming back to this location? of course! love the vibe and can't wait for another pita jungle outing. =)

yes another review of awesome accolades to a great taco shop. With all my repeat visits I thought I had written a review on this awesome taco shop. Apparently not. So, this is why I'm a fan of La Condesa... it's simply their beer battered dogfish shark tacos!!! they are soooooooooooooo good, it's like beachside fish tacos without the freaking beach, the taste, smells, and overall experience eating these totally delicious fish tacos can give you a mindf*** yes it's that good! and dipping them these beauties into my favorite salsa of all time.... confetti machine razzle dazzle... the salsa cilantro! it's soooooooo good so creamy, so perfect with their fish taco, and afterwards enjoying their horchata with fruit and cinnamon on top.... HEAVEN! love their quesas, the fish taco, La Condesa you have a fan!

I've been going to Brakemaster for an oil change eversince my first car in hs. In the past what attracted me to this place are the coupons available in the coupon clippings section in the Sunday paper. The coupon is for $19.95 with tire rotation and brake check or something. Maybe because of habit, I still go to Brakemasters sans coupon since I ask for synthetic oil for my oil change, I am able to go without an oil change up to 10k miles with synthetic compared to 5k with regular.   What I like about this location is that it's not as busy in comparison to its location on dobson. PIus it's newer. So it's a short wait, a larger garage, and, why i really like Brakemasters is its free wi-fi. So no need to wait for oil change skimming through magazines, now I can still be connected to the world, either on yelp or facebook... YAY!   I usually go for the deluxe oil change package that is, they top off and replace all fluids, check, and rotate my tires, and do my oil change. Brakemasters also repairs cars and does ac cleanings and the sort. Not once have I had a problem with my cars when they've done work on it. So, if you see a brakemasters and need an oil change, you should stop by!

Barbra Seville in my opinion is the reigning Miss Arizona Drag Queen... she is the performer that has graced us with her loveliness, feistiness, and hotness for quite awhile. I've seen her perform since the first day I saw a drag show at an old bar and restaurant that I will always remember fondly of, Pookies. She is the ultimate queen, and we Phoenicians both gay and straight alike are lucky to be her subjects.   Her show's are on Sat nights and there's a cover as well. If you have a large group it's a good idea to make a reservation that evening since depending who's performing with Barbra can be a packed house. The show starts at 10pm but with drag time, it can start past that. And at the shows you see drag in all its glory. the dresses, the showtunes, the comedy, and the banter. Audience participation is necessary as well as being a good sport. And the ladies do appreciate some dollar tips for their hot performances. The drinks at the Showroom can be strong, Tokyo Teas are good there too... and they know how to make a good tic tac. So if you got nothin else to do and want to see some counter-culture hotness, try to catch a show with Ms. Barbra Seville and she can promise a gay ol' time pun intended!

This review is of the Release pool party on weekends.  Pool parties in Phoenix during the summer is one of the best ways to beat the heat, and enjoy daytime. The Release pool party accomplishes that by having a large resort pool to lounge in, plenty of chairs, and for the most part, somewhat attentive servers. It takes place between 11am to 6pm but the actual shenanigans is between 1pm to 5pm when a live dj plays the crowd. It actually bothers me that they don't play music prior to 1pm and they don't keep the music playing until after 5pm. It just seems so abrupt for the music to end when you can see the crowd is having a lot of fun.   good things to know, you can't purchase a bucket of beer by yourself, you and your friend can (they adhere to the two drink max/person rule per AZ law). Or, to get around the rule, order from a server. Champagne bottles cannot be sold over the bar unless you have bottle service or you order through a server. Beer buckets (4 per bucket) run around $23 incl. tax regardless of brand. Bottled water is free.   Been to the pool party twice and plan to go again before the season ends. It's a chill pool party, with a good mix of peoples. There are hot boys and girls, the non-model types, and people who are comfortable in their own skin. not a lot of douchebaggery, and everyone is not pretentious. Last time I was here, we found out we can move chairs/furniture around as long as there's space for a wheelchair to pass, and if there are any umbrellas laying around, they're free for all, just ask security to move it for you. overall a good pool party spot, oh and Saturdays is the best day to go, far larger crowd. =)

I get the hype and the love! it's a fun club! Went here last weekend, and Sidney Samson did his set. Was impressed with the overall layout (so much room to roam and partying under the night sky was *love*), there wasn't really a dance floor perse but I guess the area closest to the dj was considered it. Anywho, I think my shout outs go to the bartenders from AZ who were so creative with their drink concoctions, it was nice to enjoy some Phoenix creativity which is something I gotta say for Phoenix bartenders they know their drinks =) Anywho, I just loved the overall vibe and my drunkenness helped make my night better, the vegas priced drinks didn't even faze me. lol. Um would I come back, yes, with more people, definitely yes! and will you be guaranteed a good time at Surrender I say HECK YES!!

Simply Delish!!!! so I've been on a noodle soup phase as of late, and coming from Phoenix where we lack many ramen shops this place fit the bill! LOVED it! the menu's simple four type of ramen soups, gyoza, and six side items. SIMPLE and really good!! I got the Tonkatsu ramen, the broth was so flavorful, wasn't greasy and it tasted just right, I got an extra order of Chashu pork and ordered the ramen as is. The serving size was plenty! we also ordered gyoza, at Monta you're able to mix all the necessary ingredients for the gyoza dipping sauce and make it spicier if you want. Anyways, my overall experience was great, and I will definitely come back when I'm in Vegas.

I was in the mall, and as I looked to my right, something caught my eye. Could it be?! the color was right, I was excited, and I was chatting to my friend but in midsentence I stopped and I couldn't contain my excitement. My friend was like, WTF?! and I was... OMG i Must buy!!! Dear reader, it was the red skinny jeans I always yearned for, and for years I would look at store windows I would pine to wear a pair. And with my recent weight loss, the time was ripe, I had to have this gorgeous, eye-numbing, eye-loving, ass-showing, leg-hugging jeans. So, I tried, loved, and bought. it was caveman easy. and from that day forward my wardrobe has forever been dazzled!

last night 5/20 i went to my friend's birthday bash held at Lucky Strikes. Upon walking into Lucky Strikes it struck me that it didn't feel like a bowling alley but rather a huge roomy club. The music was happening, there was a dj by the side bar/lounge and as you walked up the stairs/ramp it led you to a cavernous room where the bowling lanes were situated as well another bar/lounge area and two billiard tables. The overall atmosphere and decor of this place makes it a go-to destination and something central Phoenix really needed. Anywho, my friend reserved two lanes for 120 minutes, each lane was $49.99/hr and she included us in a drink package of unlimited beer and wine for $22 excl tax. let's say the unlimited drinkage helped my bowling game or lack thereof. I've never felt that pro-ish, the tipsiness really gave me courage to give it my all! liked the dj, it was a healthy mix of dance ripped top 40 with old school hip hop... it really lent a true party experience to my friend's birthday bash as well as the overall vibe of the place. BUT one thing that annoyed me with lucky strikes was the music volume, it was LOUD! now, don't get me wrong I go out to the clubs in old town and I'm used to LOUD but a club with friends is not a conversation/social experience, albeit social but i go out to the clubs to drink and get my dance on. But at a bowling alley during down times like waiting for your turn, drinking your beer, there are times you might like to chat with your friends but with the music volume, it's too loud that you spend the time nodding your head and agreeing to something you did not hear =( and it ends up being a shouting fest like, "What?!? you said what?!? huh? No... i did not buy this shirt from..., OH you said you like my shirt?! ok!! thank you! (other person - what?!?) give up, thumbs up!"   Oh, food wise well it's upgraded bowling alley food with presentation if there's such a thing. lol. we ordered a basket of Parmesan herb fries $7.5 which was a large basket and the mac & cheese bites $6 which were quite bland but cheesy and was a good serving size. Overall, I liked the place, it's a great place for a birthday and everything is professional and appealing. Oh and don't forget to get your parking validated before you leave, it HELPS!

it's all about the bread. the bread i say.   and this is what makes Jimmy John's so FREAKING addicting. Their subs are nothing special, they don't really put organic meats and fillings, no, it's the bread. It's like crack in that bread, i could just eat it and feel content.   I always get the vito or a plain jim. all their subs are yum and you oughta try. yay that they've expanded but i want a jimmy john's closer to me coz i need to feed my addiction.

So driving along 16th Street going north towards camelback, it's interesting that I've passed by Joes countless of times not realizing it's a diner. ho hum, you learn something new everyday especially in Phoenix. lol. Anywho, went to breakfast with my friend Sara V. and was lucky to get a parking spot. We went there at around 10, and were seated promptly, I'm guessing this place is not the best spot for groups larger than 4 since most of the diner is made up of booths, didn't see many free standing tables.   So the menu isn't large, it has its basics, omelettes, sandwiches, pancakes, a few combo generics like pork loin and eggs, chicken fried steak and eggs, corn beef hash and so forth. I got myself the chicken fried steak with eggs (over medium) and a short stack of pancakes. Also, got an apple juice and I should have asked if it was the actual juice and not the cider, it was the cider and altho it's not my fave, i drank it. The service wasn't slow at all, the staff was busy yet friendly, we even had Joe in his chef pants (I didn't know they were chef pants until Sara V. told me they were, I thought the pattern and fabric looked weird) ask how we were. *nice touch* It's great that Joe connects with his customers. =) (okay that's a star!)  Anyways the food came, and the chicken fried steak was alright not the best, and yes, I've had better, and the potatoes with the plate were alright but for two stars alone are the pancakes. YUMMMMMMMMMMM! they're crispy, and so freaking good with the butter and syrup... delish! I'll come back to Joes for the pancakes coz that's where the money's at. Overall good service - a star, delicious pancakes - two stars and Joe connecting with his customers, another star = 4 stars. Chances of me coming back, soon I hope, I'm craving a stack! extra butter please! =)

the rustic setting of this craftsman bungalow on 5th street acts as a cozy destination in the Roosevelt district. Upon walking up the steps and into the house amidst the sounds of folkesque alt. music wafting out to the street, you know this is a real indie kinda coffee shop/creperie. The crepes served at JoBot are delish with around 10 savories and almost the same number with the sweets. With a wide variety on their menu, a great selection of hot bevvies, some hansen natural soda types as well as a good selection of jarritos, this is a good place to stop by, sit back, eat a crepe and either have a hot drink during an odd cold night in Phoenix or sip a refreshing jarrito to recover from the hot summer day.Recommendations are the #8 machaca pulled pork, and the #9 root beer pulled pork for the savory and the go to banana with nutella for the sweet. So, if you find yourself close to JoBot and are craving a crepe, stop by because it's worth the calories and the yum factor. Open late nights weeknights, and 24 hours Fridays, Saturdays.

Beckett's has fast become the "it" restaurant in the Arcadia scene or maybe it's the lack thereof of good restaurants in Arcadia like Beckett's that makes this place overflowing with diners.   Thanks to Yelp, I came across this "hot on Yelp" restaurant and went here with a couple of friends, and we were surprised with how busy this place was that we found ourselves waiting for a table for an hour. My first visit I attempted to order the shortrib and was dismayed they ran out. So, I ended with the cast iron petite chicken. Which was good. My first visit was Nov. of 2010. let's flash forward to 1/14/2011.  I went again with my friend Sara to see if Beckett's could still win us over a second time, Parlor has the magic everytime I eat there as well as Geisha's HH. We both agreed that we would get the mussels as an appetizer. And this time I called (on a thursday night) to see if I could make a reservation for friday night, and learned that the prime reservation slots were taken, so, this makes me assume that I must make a reservation on a Tuesday or Wed. at least, sheesh! ok, back to the food...  the mussels were really soft, and the sauce/gravy was divine meaning it wasn't thick and creamy no, it had a good texture and you could really taste the fennel, and the wine, it's GOOD. This time I was able to order the fork tender short ribs and let me just say this, it's more than fork tender, it's YUM! forget the sides just give me two short ribs! I now understand why they run out....mmm yum! Sara got the beef bourguignon shepherd's pie which was good but not great unlike the short ribs. Anywho another good experience at Beckett's and will come back again. Oh as for desserts, as a dessert fiend, pass on it and look elsewhere, they're quite meh, and tammie coe's is up the street. so hurrah for beckett's!

Yes I'm entertained! With the overabundance of reality stars and the dazzling lights of the LED chandeliers and the ceiling graphics this nightclub-esque bar is spot to be at. I agree with previous reviews how it's a great place just to people watch because my time there with three of my girlfriends led to them being magnets of the many reality stars (of the VH1 kind) who would talk them up to the point of annoyance. It's an exciting space at the corner of the first floor of the Cosmopolitan by the casino and across The Henry. You see the LED lights changing to the beats of the music, the dj is spinning (and actual vinyl decks =)) and by the windows facing the strip, you see these "floating" pods where there are go-go dancers. The visual excitement at this place goes to overdrive, so much to see!  Drink prices here was actually the highlight of our stay at the Bond, everything was moderate priced and worth it. Champagne was around $13/glass and the signature Cosmo (with the blood orange garnish) which was OH SO YUM was $12. This bar/lounge is gorgeous, drinks are good, plenty of space to roam, and the tunes great! Totally recommend this place and a must stop whether you pass by the Cosmo, walk the strip or are a guest at the hotel. love it! =)

The food at this restaurant is simply delightful in presentation, smells and taste.   I went to this location as part of a UYE hosted by Deb L., went with my best Sara V and was looking forward to trying this place after reading the many five star accolades and reviews of this restaurant. I do not give out five stars often but if I was to base it on the atmosphere, and decoration of this restaurant, it would be five stars BUT five stars are for the food and the food is a five star delight.   Sara V and I decided to share two apps and split an entree. We ordered the Petite Grilled Fromage (capicola, seahive cheddar, salad rouge) and the Proscuitto Wrapped Shrimp (blackberry glaze + spicy soy mustard), followed by a split order of the Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs and Green Apple Slaw with jicama & watercress + smoked gouda mac-n-cheese. The petite fromage was delicious and the salad rouge had so many flavors with the avocado, and the golden raisins. It was a party of flavors with every chew and the melted cheddar enveloped the brioche bread just right, it was heaven. And the OMG moment came from the Proscuitto Wrapped Shrimp, served on a skewer, the blackberry glaze complemented the salad served with the shrimp, and the glaze provided the sweet with tangy of the spicy soy mustard, there were so many flavors to enjoy that it was a "as good as it gets" moment!   Our entree was another winner with BBQ baby back ribs, the flavors derived from the the sauce was just delicious, it complemented well with the apple slaw. I think the disappointment with our entree was the smoked gouda mac-n-cheese because I hardly could taste the gouda, and panko bread crumb topping didn't help the dish or do justice, it was quite bland and out of place for a flavorful dish.   Our party was treated to a dessert sweet board of goodies courtesy of the Herb box, on this confectionary tray was a red velvet cupcake, a fig apple bundt cake, a rootbeer cupcake, a passionfruit type cake and a chocolate type pastry. The Red velvet cupcake topping was yummy but the cupcake itself was moist somewhat but not throughout, the passionfruit had a good outer shell, but my favorite sweet treat was the fig apple cake, it reminded me of strudel.   Overall, i enjoyed my UYE dinner, making new friends. And I did love the food made by Becky (the chef/owner). our appetizers and entree was delicious and I look forward to coming back for lunch/dinner and hopefully Sunday brunch.

I first went to Bonfire Grill and Bar on 8/12 with a friend and we ordered two apps each, they were: skewered grilled cheese sandwich, the skewered handmade pork meatballs, the tenderbelly st. louis pork ribs and the salt and pepper fried pork belly biscuits. Our visit to the restaurant was at around 9:30p and were surprised to see only a few diners. Let me say that the food served at Bonfire Grill is pretty good. Of course, the pork ribs could have a less sweeter sauce and something with a little more kick but overall every small plate we ordered was yum. I also got myself the Sangria which was refreshing. My two star review is simply because of bad service.   From the start, getting the attention of our server proved to be a task, water refills had to be asked for as well as giving the bartender/server/available person around a dirty look hoping to get their attention just for more water. I really feel that bad or lackluster service regardless of how good the food can ruin the dining experience. Granted on our first visit there, the food and drink made up for the lack of service that I made the decision when I left that I would come back. FASTFORWARD to 8/19. I mentioned Bonfire to two friends and was able to get them to come out for dinner and try out Bonfire. I reassured them that it was a good place to go to, and on the drive to Bonfire I started salivating over the yummy salt and pepper fried pork belly biscuits.   This time around again on a friday night, the Bonfire was happening. A band was playing and upon walking in, the restaurant was busy and almost full. We were given a choice to sit at either a table or booth, and we chose the booth. My second dining experience at Bonfire and my friends first was doomed from the moment we chose the booth to sit at. Upon closer look, the table was not clean, and we had to wait for it to be cleaned after having to ask someone to do that. Upon seating, menus were handed to us, and the service ENDED there. We were seated at 9:45p and no waters were served or was a drink order even taken from the time we sat down, at 10:05p, with no server in sight to even check on us or even assist us, my friends and I were ANNOYED. I even decided I was gonna call the resto from the booth to inform them that the corner booth we were at was being IGNORED by their staff. 20 minutes of no acknowledgement or service whatsoever is unacceptable. After waiting 20 minutes, failing to get the attention of a server or any server whatsoever, we decided to leave. I am dismayed that a restaurant in old town that has promise suffers from a severe lack of customer service. Regardless of how busy your resto might be, I would hope your staff are trained to realize which table might need assistance and whatnot, Bonfire showed a lack of care, and has marred any positives I may have held in regard towards this resto. Bad customer service = a bad dining experience and hence my two stars.

The Miel is delish. This heavenly concoction of honey and vanilla in a coffee beverage is tastebud heaven, its scent permeates the cardboard confines of the to-go cup, and upon first sip puts you into a sensation frenzy. It relaxes you, and puts you in a good mood. Your now one with yourself and at peace. The Miel is one with the force, and you are now a jedi. Now go forth and spread happiness and peace with the world. =)

if you want douches and crap service then El Hefe is your spot. Two years ago this was a rotation nightout spot for friends and I, so, I never had the chance to try out the place during early evening hours for food and drink. Fast forward to recently, seeing that Hi-Fi Kitchen across the street was ridic crowded compared to not as busy El Hefe, a friend and I decided to stop by for a drink and a snack. Upon entering we were told by one of the server/hostess girls to pick a table or sit at the bar. We both wanted to sit outside but saw all their high tops were taken and reluctantly sat at the bar. After a few mins, while waiting to order drinks, a table emptied out, and we snatched it up and this is where they get a one star.   Personally they do a good job as a bar in old town during the weekends, they play okayish dance music, it's loud, it's happening, it's relevant. They have the douches out to play and they keep the nighttime masses liquored up BUT that's it. Service wise they fail miserably. As we sat at our table, we waited, and waited, and waited so more. There was a server who went by us to attempt to clean up (attempt because she didn't do much) another vacated table, she passed us yet again to check on another table, and passed us yet again just walking by. She could clearly see that we were sitting there with two menus, looking at it, and now bored looking at our phones, and not ONCE did she take the courtesy to stop by and offer a drink order or water. NOTHING. Let me add, it's a bit disconcerting as a customer when you hear the bar staff express concern that Hi-Fi seems really busy across the street while they talk about their lack of business on their side. With servers that do not provide service I can see why you ought to be worried.   I'm a patient person, and I give props to good service where due but our last straw occurred when a group of girls (six in all) showed up, walked in a grabbed a table behind us on the patio, and lo behold, the SAME SERVER, walks up and assists them, hands out menus, and turns around and ignores us yet again. WTF?!? We got up, we walked out. I saw the manager and felt the need to express my disgust at what I witnessed, maybe I didn't express myself clearly but he didn't seem to care much either. We walked out.

Phoenix and its large abundance of ice cream shops, Churn rates high in the cutesy scale. Small in size, it appeals to me since they have good ice cream as well delectable sweets. I love their assortment of cookies and bars. I like that you can make your own ice cream sandwich, and that it's encouraged. I've been here numerous times but I would like to highlight the professionalism of their staff when accommodating my niece who has a peanut allergy. They made sure to rinse the ice cream scooper as well take out a new tub of the double chocolate ice cream, in order to ensure that there wouldn't be any contamination whatsoever. I commend the staff for doing that extra step. bravo. Anywho, if you plan to eat at the ice cream shop, there are tables in the back patio, and since there's lack of parking, complimentary valet is offered (no need to risk your life crossing busy central ave. by parking across the street).

The owners of this bakery are originally from New Jersey and originally owned a chain of bakery shops of the same name until they sold them off and retired here. So, in terms of experience they have it, and they know their stuff.  The lechon on weekends is on point. It's crispy and roasted the way I like it, Tagalog style! =) Yes, it does make a difference. =)  Other things I'm a fan of there are their puto bungbong (glutinous rice with shredded coconut and sugar), the espasol (filipino rice cake made from rice flour cooked in coconut milk and sweetened coconut strips, dusted with toasted rice flour) it's true laguna to the pinoys. Their siopao is decent, the ensymada is lacking alot of topping, and the empanadas are okay not that great. Overall they have a wide selection of filipino baked goods at decent prices but you gotta try the lechon, at least a pound of it ($8.50).   You oughta try it and keep this local filipino bakery around coz they're worth it.

At one time, The Mint was something worth waiting to get in line to, it looked classy, the unisex bathrooms was sexy (reminded me of the defunct Universal Nightclub in Hillcrest in San Diego, CA), and it just looked nice. Fast forward to October 2013, and their bouncers are still douches. So, prior, to the "revamp", there were lines and yes, the bouncers were douches BUT bribery was not as blatant. It's far more blatant now, it's practically encouraged. I was here last Saturday, and got there before the long lines, it was myself and four ladies. What bothered me about their exclusion methods was that they were letting in groups of guys bribe their way in moreso than groups that had a 3 girls to 1 guy ratio in the GA (General Admission) line. I get it, table service should get in, and guestlist (sure, why not) but groups of testosterone, seriously? I saw way too many guys getting in that it made me chuckle coz it felt it was a gay club posing as a straight club. Yea, I may sound annoyed but I was surprised my group had to wait 40 minutes to get in. I thought nightclubs want ladies in their club moreso than guys, since, um guys are gonna buy drinks for the ladies, right? isn't that how straight clubs work? Anywho, it's a shame, the revamp didn't improve it's inside, it's darker, the unisex bathroom no longer has the sexy appeal (the night I was there, it seems they did away with the champagne bar, and made it into a regular mixed cocktails and beer station). drink prices are typical Scottsdale, glass of champagne and wine were $10. Music was a mix of EDM and Hip-Hop courtesy of DJ Aaron Taylor of 104.7 FM. If you're into douches, creepsters, and the attempt to be an exclusive club, The Mint is totally your scene and if not, there's still other clubs that are better.

I sometimes find the Indian/Pakistani resto choices in Metro Phoenix lacking, some places are good with certain specialties, etc. with Curry Corner, most of their curries and biryanis are on point. For instance their chicken tikka masala consistently tastes great, as well as their Karahi's and the Chicken Achari.   I've been a regular customer the last 10 years, back when Curry Corner occupied a storefront at the corner of Lemon Rd and Terrace and pre-food network fame when it was a go to for Indian international students living nearby. I'm happy that they've grown and have still retained their low prices, and the portions have stayed the same. I like their cheese naan, and the tawa paratha too. Definitely get yourself a mango lassi, it's so refreshing especially when it's warm out.

Mark's cafe is one of those places that you pass by at a strip mall unsure of what kind of restaurant it is, you know those places that don't pique interest unless you stumble upon it on yelp? It doesn't lack character, it's the curb appeal that throws you off because it's not much to look at from the outside but inside meaning the food, it's worth exploring and enjoying. Went with a friend on a random Saturday brunch/breakfast outing. S wanted a place close to home, so, I looked via yelp, and noticed Mark's had good reviews and stars. Read somewhere it's a benedict kinda place.   Anywho, the staff was friendly, endearing, and welcoming. They have a wide selection of omelettes, benedicts, and lunch items. They also have many special items, and from what our server told us, they accommodate special requests since Mark has a knack for coming up with good eats. I got the Ultimate Benedict, which comes with prosciutto, tomato, spinach, and avocado over a croissant, with either regular or spicy hollandaise, I recommend you get the spicy because it's not spicy per se but it has this smoky full flavor that grows with each bite. What I love about this benedict is that it's layered on top of a croissant, so, the bread just soaks up the sauce and all the goodness. I also got a single stack pancake (which is the size of the plate, so, get one if you're getting it as a side), and they have toppings, so, our server's recommendation was to get the banana pecan, my friend got the banana pecan combined with the blueberry compote. It was all delicious, and I'm adding Mark's to my breakfast rotation. P.S. they have more than tabasco if you're looking for a spicy condiment, just ask. Happy eats!

One of my bests kept on telling me how they were a fan of Corner and wanted to share the Corner bakery goodness with me, so, we went for brunch, well she was driving, so, she did have first choice. Anywho, the Arizona Center location we went to that Saturday, was inundated with a long line of people, mainly women (found out there was a women's convention taking place, and it was the lunch break). My friend was concerned the quality would not be as good because of the many patrons but I maintain the belief that if you're a good resto, regardless of how busy you get, your quality and service should not slide. Anyways, after a 40 minute or so, wait, we ordered. I got a Southwest salad, the cheddar broccoli soup, and a maple pecan bar. My friend got the Pesto Cavatappi. We opted to sit out on the patio since the weather was gorgeous, and waited for the food to be delivered. Upon receipt of our food, my friend noticed her pasta dish was lukewarm and not hot, so, it had to be sent back. The bread served along with my soup was cold and wasn't worth eating, the salad was not that great especially since it was drenched with dressing, it might have been wrong for me to assume but many other places I've been to, the dressing is usually served on the side as to allow the diner to decide how much dressing they would like to use. The soup was okay, nothing exceptional. The only good thing was the sweet because the maple pecan bar was moist, and not too sweet. It was around 1:50pm and I was gonna go back inside to refill my drink and found the doors leading to the patio were locked, so, I went to the front and found the doors locked and that was at 1:55pm (they close at 2pm). I kept on knocking and even called them through my phone a couple timee, so, I could tell them i was at their patio and wanted in, so, i could refill my drink. After what took close to 7 mins of constant knocking, a customer in the resto saw my debacle and let me in. As I was refilling my drink, I approached the server, who had delivered our food to tell them of the locked patio door. Her excuse was that someone should have told us that sitting on the patio can possibly get yourself locked out if you're there within the last hour before closing. I'm gonna  be honest and I find that it's outrageous they lock their doors without checking their patio to see if they have patrons sitting outside, and I think it's stupid to have a patio and restrict people to where they can sit an hour before they close. Personally the food is not that great, service was lackluster, and the overall quality was just BAD. Will i ever consider coming back? I think not, and lastly, do something about your patio situation, it doesn't make sense. Oh, and this is proof how it's a crap resto when they're unable to maintain food quality, and service at their busiest periods. It's a shame.

stumbled (literally) upon fuzzy's last weekend after Oktoberfest, my brief fun chasing down my other's friends bike cab made me hungry, and my brief conversation with an ASU coed who was wondering about the dick on my tee got me curious... to try out this place. I was seriously wanting slices but my friend Dani who I was walking with persuaded me to try out the place coz we were right next to it, and we were tipsy. So, walking in you really get that there's nothing local about this place, it's so commercial and chainish that it's disheartening with how Mill ave sold out. Anyways, saw the lackluster choices, and noticed that for breakfast burritos they were missing a basic item choice, a SAUSAGE burrito, heck that's common at every bertos drive thru, it's like a cheese quesadilla it's such a normal thing to order, WTF?! so ordered a bacon, cheese and egg burrito and waited for it to come out. Got the burrito and was dismayed with how non-hefty it was. for $4.50 i expect hefty, thick, with grease dripping, and it should be too thick to put in my mouth because it's so big BUT sadly this burrito was limp! LIMP! and it really wasn't satisfying, Del Taco's even better than this, and del taco tastes damn good when you're drunk, to the point you think it's so delicious that it's gourmet, sadly this was alright. My experience was eh, and the owner/manager dude asked how i liked it, and let's just say alcohol reveals the truth. Any chance of me coming back? never.

I really dig their fish tacos... they're so yummy in my tummy especially on Friday's when it's a special. Oh and the cheese quesadilla is not made with american cheese but with the mexican white cheese, which is so much better! good eats.

the crust on their pies are just yum, and the consistency is just right. I do like their wide selection of fruit and cream pies. The Arizona Orange pie tastes like a creamsicle and I am a fan of both their blueberry and strawberry rhubarb pies. Sometimes I feel that it would be nice if they had more than one person out front, like someone to box up the pies and another to take orders. At times, waiting more than 10 minutes to buy a pie can be troublesome for a customer who might be in a hurry BUT the pies are worth it. There are some items that I wish I was aware of how to order beforehand like the no sugar pies. I was told by the sales associate that those pies have to be ordered ahead, and it seems they seem to not make a large batch of popular items for sale like their green chile pork pies. I just couldn't understand how they could be sold out when I was there an hour and a half after they had opened. Overall, it's a good pie shop and I recommend to all to try at least one pie. BTW they do not do pie slices and have a limited selection of mini pies. Oh, and try the green chile pork pot pie. It's a must!

i had to get rid of some extra energy, so, i walked in and found myself in their aerobic space, and zumba'd me tired! It was fun and exciting, I got to express myself and let everyone know I was born this way. Sweaty and tired after my hour long session, I said my goodbyes and left, went home, showered and slumbered.

I'm still dreaming of the Waffle with the maple glazed brisket and two sunny side eggs. Yum! I had my waffle with the crispy bacon mixed in, and OH MY FEISTY YUM!! Yes, get it with bacon, it makes it that much better, and scrumptious! Service was on point, water was always refilled and I'm coming back for the mussels and creme fraiche plus more good eats!

yep believe the hype, it's very wildesque, and interesting. The venue is a cross of vaudeville/burlesque, and the winding hallway gives you that impression. the statue or a live art (i'm not sure since I was still slightly drunk from my daylife shenanigans) is something to check out, i was hesitant to make further eye contact coz i was afraid it would move. eh. Anywho follow the hallway, and you'll find a corner bar, grab a drink then follow the hall up to the main section of the club in which you'll find another bar, and lot of booths (for bottle service), and a stage with a tiny dancefloor. Like everyone has mentioned you can on the stage when there isn't an Act on stage. The night we went, the dj was playing top 40 and old school hip hop which I loved since you hardly hear that sound in Vegas, it's a good change from all the EDM you hear at the tier 1 clubs. The Act has a good vibe, and a great atmosphere. loved the music and drinks are typical vegas prices. Not sure how much cover is since I went there as part of the "aod invasion" hosted by the jackcolton.com group. Oh, and some acts are downright trippy.

I'm happy I can get my poutine fix when I find myself craving it, too bad it's served as an appetizer coz it's a little too small. Anywho, I've been here a couple times but this was my first time in their new larger location. The overall atmosphere, the service was quite slow though, I guess don't go there when you're really hungry, or else you're gonna be cranky! The stuffed mushrooms were good and greasy and the pork loin had great flavor. I had the pork schnitzel for my entree, and it was delicious, loved the green bean side, and the potatoes. There were so many flavors that I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. The portions were more than substantial as well but I made sure to only eat half because I had to keep room for dessert which was the Beaver Supreme. I read somewhere that it's regarded by AZ Republic food critic, Howard Seftel's one of the top 10 desserts in the Phoenix area and I can see why. It's made up of two whipped meringue wafers and in the middle is a big dollop of fresh whipped cream with mandarin orange slices. It's a simple, light dessert and I'm not a big fan of meringue but their's was delicious. It can be messy to eat but worth it. My overall dinner experience was great, I was stuffed and will return, for poutine and the Beaver Supreme. ;)

You got to get their carnitas grilled cheese with each bite, you know it was made out of love! The carnitas is so good, the melted cheeses delicious, and the bread scrumptious, oh and the avocado cream sauce is a must, so, dip your grilled cheesus, and just know the calories are so worth it! YUM!

I will miss their yummy melts, I just scarfed down the Jailbreaker! A concoction of four cheese melted in white bread, buttered, with Parmesan cheese, it's decadent and delicious!!   I just got word they are leaving our fair city to cooler climes, and moving to Denver, so, I gotta have their Carnitas Melt one last time! xx

Went to Pallets on a Friday night (4/12) excited at the prospect to 1) try out a new place in the arts district and 2) have a hot bowl of noodle soup. We got to choose where to sit on any of their 3 patios, and menus were handed out. A server came by and took our drink orders, a Pinot for me, and an IPA for a friend (originally wanted a Malbec but was told they were out, no big) oddly enough service stopped there. My friend and I while waiting for our drink orders as well as perusing the menu overheard the next table over being told by their server that of the 50 items on the Vietnamese menu only 3 items remained. Hearing that my friend and I started to feel uneasy about our experience at the resto. As we sat unsure where to go to next, another server came by to assist us, it's interesting that our original server did not bother to bring our drink orders or assist us further (that's a star for that). I then asked the (second) server if what we had overheard was true and he confirmed that their whole Vietnamese section was out and then proceeded to tell us that we could still order from their Japanese section without batting an eye. That pretty much sealed the deal for us in which I replied that if I had an intention to get myself sushi that evening I could have done so by going to Moira around the corner (so that's another star off) and I must say that my overall experience was marred because of the dishonesty of their host staff for not being forthright with their limited menu and seating us (a star off for that) and finally who runs out of food?! I've been to quite a good number of very popular Vietnamese restos in Phoenix like Da Vang, Little Saigon, Saigon Pho to name a few and even during their really busy periods, not once have I been told they have run out of certain item (so another star off). I really wanted  to give Pallets a chance that evening and had every intention to but I guess it wasn't meant to be.   Will I give it another chance? I'm not sure about that.

O...M...G!!! the strawberry brown sugar cake is just... (orgasmic) wait, heavenly... no, scrumptious... no, DELIGHTfully delicious!! Went recently to get a side of something to accompany my packed lunch, and every time I've popped in, I have eyed the strawberry cake like a sugar addict going through rehab, oh wait like a sugar addict? No, I still am a sugar fiend but I digress, anywho I have eye-balled this confection numerous times but I have chosen other treats like the pop tart, the chocolate chip cookie, the lemon bar BUT no I didn't resist I chose cake, and this cake has brought me joy, I feel revitalized ready to take on my afternoon, ready to accomplish, err, no but I would like another piece. Oh, and in addition to the strawberry cake, I had a cup of pumpkin soup, delicious but that's another story, my dear it's all about the cake!

IMHO better than Snoh in Phoenix because of the consistency of their snow, and they have larger selection of flavors, toppings, and the same number of glaze. The prices are a little cheaper $0.50 less. It's a stall at the Mekong food court that usually plays EDM in the background. Overall, do love their version of snoh because it's doesn't melt as quick and firmer with more of an ice cream texture. So, if you're craving a cool treat, stop by and treat yourself to snow goodness!

I adore this resto, hands down the best sushi in metro Phoenix. I've had numerous rolls here for lunch, and one of my favorites is the OMG roll, it's served wrapped in foil and flaming! And yes, when it's served, you're like OMG! (insert valley girl reaction here)   I'm a fan of the H3 roll which is spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail, and the Ahi Tower too which is more a rice bowl of sorts. What I love about this place is that it's unique in that their sushi is made with purple or forbidden rice. So it's better than white rice, and brown rice too. It's pretty much a sushi resto with exceptions during the weekday lunch hour where they also serve bento boxes. The seafood is fresh, good eats, and a great experience!

Bravo to the modern Asian noodle and dumpling house. The noodles soups are top notch, especially the Hot Pot seafood soup, as well as the simply delicious in a bowl, Roasted Pork noodle soup with ramen. I'm still thinking about it until now, although I could do without the mushrooms (and I like mushrooms). My friend and I, shared two starters, the Smoked "Pig Face" dumplings and the Peking Duck bun. The dumplings were scrumptious because of the pork, yum but i'm not sure if the price is justified at $8 for 4 pieces, it's pretty much the size of a gyoza dumpling, so, it's not large but taste factor it's on point. As for the Peking duck bun that can be split between two but one bun per person will suffice because it's plenty and delicious, I'm looking forward to trying out their other buns in the near future. My friend got the chicken katsu, and she said it was pretty good but advised that in the future, she'd get the sauce on the side because it was quite salty. Overall, love the resto layout, the overall feel is cozy but for some odd reason there seems to be a draft. Service was not slow but there seem to be confusion with some orders, I'm thinking it's first official day jitters, and eventually i'm sure, service will smoothen out. I'm looking forward to my next visit for a steaming bowl of noodles or maybe kimchi fried rice. YUM!

The Henry seems to be the crown jewel of the FRC (I've heard their kitchen is the test kitchen for upcoming Fox Restaurant Concepts). This can be seen just from its outward appearance with its patio, and the tables lined up outside. Its interior is well made up with its classic contemporary look. There are couches in the lounge areas, and oversized booths with mismatched lamps, and the bar area next to the open kitchen gives this place a look of a true European Brasserie. I went on a recent Saturday evening that was abuzz with people, from the onset with the close to full parking lot, one can see this is the current "it" restaurant of Phoenix. It's great for people watching and it attracts a diverse crowd.   I went with some friends, and it seemed difficult to order a drink from the bar since it also served as a dining area that left little room for bystanders peering through the seated persons in attempt to order a cocktail. They have a good selection of wines, limited beer selection, and their cocktails selection is not huge either but I have to say they are all superb. I had the white cranberry punch which was refreshing, a friend had the red stiletto (which to me tasted like cherry Robitussin *shudder*) that she enjoyed, as well as the Prayer Meeting topped with a cabernet float that was exquisite. Other friends ordered the Fig and Ginger Mule served in a copper mug *kudos* and the Pomegranate 75, and heard praises for both.   Dinner was started with two appetizers, the cheddar popovers and the truffle fries. The popovers were good not spectacular but the butters served alongside were the stars of the app, actually the ham butter was the star, and the chive butter was good. I'm tempted to get the ham butter alone because it reminded me of liverwurst pate (the ham flavor was subtle and texture smooth). I ordered the Pork Chop although I was tempted to get the half Roasted Chicken because of the sides but I'm glad I got the Pork Chop because it was delicious. The bone-in was moist with flavor. The Swiss Chard served with the Pork Chop had good flavor and the Cauliflower polenta is something I will order again as a side because it was delicious. I made sure to save some room for dessert because prior to my dining experience at The Henry, I had seen a picture of the dessert menu someone had posted on Yelp, and although The Henry was a resto I wanted to try, my eyes were on the chocolate cake from the very beginning. Yes, I was disappointed it wasn't a slice (I was thinking it would be similar to the chocolate cake at the Parlor, which imho is still one of the best chocolate cakes served in Phoenix) but with the layered vanilla and chocolate ganache, this chocolate cupcake (served in a small jar) was enough sweet for two, it's too sweet because of the ganache but it is good but not something that I dream about unlike the Monkey Bread of Culinary Dropout.   Overall, The Henry is a solid four stars, and I can't wait to go back either for dinner or brunch. .

I didn't know my cinco 2014 was going to start out with a bad taste and ill feelings toward others but a bartender at Salty Senorita accomplished that. I went to Salty like years before to start my cinco night out with a goal of sipping a refreshing margarita, unlike years before, the patio didn't seem that crowded (maybe it's a larger location?). My friend and I went to the main bar, and proceeded to wait patiently for the bartender to take our drink order. It was busy with more than 4 bartenders serving customers along with the manager, my friend and I were able to secure two bar stools, and we waited. There was a group of people to the left of me who got a drink order in even though they had been waiting shorter than us but I ignored it thinking she (the bartender) was just busy and hadn't noticed us, mind you we were sitting in front of where she was working. I remember a group of guys who were standing behind us asked if we were closing out because we had our cards ready but we said no and said we were waiting. 20 minutes had passed and still no margarita, so, we waited more, yes, I could see she was busy but I also noticed she was talking with the guys sitting to the right of us, and she was talking with a colleague at the cashier but for some odd reason when it came to us two sitting IN FRONT of her line of vision, she chose to ignore us, yet again stayed patient because that's how I am, I only get angry when I am being blatantly ignored BUT when the guys standing behind us moved to standing to the left of me, and SHE asked for their order, that was it, I had enough! So, I did what any annoyed customer did, I yelled a HEY! to her to get her attention (prior to that I took her picture), she then turned around (surprise surprise, apparently you need to show displeasure to get service here), and snapped back with, I don't serve people who swear at me! EXCUSE ME?!? when did saying "HEY" come off as swearing? And that was the last straw, I couldn't foresee myself staying there for a drink.   I asked for the manager as any customer would and I shared my displeasure with the lack of service I received. Yes, he offered a drink BUT that's not good enough, I refused because I just couldn't see myself spending money. So, imagine this Salty Senorita, afterwards my friend and I went to El Hefe and got ourselves a margarita, then afterwards we were looking to have dinner and proceeded across the street to Hi-Fi, and ordered food and more drinks, when our intention that evening was to go to Salty Senorita, grab a drink or two and have dinner. We spent close to $80 that could have been spent at your establishment but because of the discourteous service of a bartender who lacked the attention of scanning the bar as well as to check who needed orders and such, you lost a few customers. Now, that's sad.

I've been going to Hayley for years, followed her from Dizin to Habit then Habit 2 and now at Mint. Regardless of distance, she's worth it because she cares about her clients and knows hair. As a person she has a sweet disposition, and as a stylist she knows what works best, and will experiment color with you and try to ensure you have an overall positive experience. I've been doing color with her for some time, been working with purple, blue, red, teal, copper color tones, and I like that she follow-ups with you on how the color turned out and she makes fixes by buying different color products in hopes it'll last longer, that alone shows how caring Hayley is, some stylists would usually stick to products that they think is good enough but for Hayley good enough is not it, she goes for great or better.   Hayley always takes the time to catch up with you, and is flexible when it comes to appointments. I wholly recommend you get a cut/color with her because she's great at what she does!

There was a time where Postino Arcadia was my favorite location but after my visit to the Annex, I'm afraid Arcadia no longer holds top spot in my heart. Granted their Arcadia location is super cozy and your neighbors can be up close and personal, the Annex location has a lot of space but still retains a certain character that's unique to it's location. I love they have a large patio area, and the inside has large booths for big groups, add the long bar which is accessible to the inside and patio, makes wine drinking and bruschetta boards noshing far more enjoyable. It would have been a nice touch if there were fire pits outside when it gets far cooler to be on the patio but the candle pits are aesthetically appealing too.   I like to commend our main server Nick, he was pleasant and took the time to assist my friend's allergies with nuts and citrus. He's top notch, and an asset to the Postino Annex staff. I think there are new additions to the bruschetta such as the Salami with Pesto which was oh so scrumptious, the pesto on the MJ bread hit the spot! Overall, love the new addition to the Postino family, and looking forward to enjoying wine sips under the tea-lights at the Annex. :)

The Strawberry Glazed donut tastes like strawberry jam every bite YUM!! Went  recently coz it's slow at work plus I had a hankering for coffee, and starbucks gets lame, the coffee at the market downstairs, although fresh and cheap is not delicious, so, Rollover sounded like a good place for coffee and a sweet treat. I have to say although I'm not a big fan of brioche donuts (more of a cake donut fan), their flavors are on point. Albeit pricey for specialty donuts at $2.25/piece and the regular donuts at a little less than 2 but their baker's dozen comes out to $14, so, not bad. I like they have a good selection of coffee and carry alternative milks, like soy and almond although there is a 50 cent upcharge but no big. Will I go back? Yes, and next time I'm gonna try the maple glaze with bacon, the other specialties just sound too weird for my taste like the Bear which is bbq sauce and pb, say what?! Anywho, try out the goodness!

We failed to get out in time because we stumbled on the last puzzle and although we solved it, we just ran out of time. Phew... had to get that off my chest. lol. Went to Escape the Room for my birthday and I had the bright idea to book the most difficult room and not only that felt the need to make it more compromising by having pre drinks prior to the event. And like I planned it, I wasn't any help except for me yelling the clues out loud. we started late, and time was against us from the beginning, so, it makes sense we missed the mark. Will I do it again? Yes, and I'm looking forward to trying out the other rooms. Good clean fun! :)

It's been a while since there's been a Malaysian resto in the Phoenix area, the last time there was one was back in the early 2000s. Anywho, for me a Malaysian resto must have a good roti canai, and a delicious Laksa, and BP Street Cafe passes both taste tests! The roti canai is a single serving for one, so, if you have a group you'll have to order a couple, has some spice to it, it's delicious, and the roti isn't flaky and has good consistency. As for the Laksa, it's Johor Laksa and not the Sarawak Laksa I am accustomed to, overall it's spicy, the coconut broth has a good taste to it, and they give plenty of noodle.   I'm looking forward to going back, and trying their Mee Siam, the Nasi Lemak, and their fried chicken. I wish they had Ais Kachang since the weather is getting warmer, and it would be a cool treat to have but I'll try their Momo Chacha in lieu of because it sounds refreshing. Another wish is if they had KangKung Belacan although I think that might be not be as readily available in the Asian grocery stores here.   Anyways I wish BP the best of luck, they make good eats and I'm looking forward to future visits!

I'm not sure how genuine Quebec Poutine tastes like since I've never step foot in Montreal but I can imagine it might taste even more delicious than what is offered at US Fries because theirs is pretty darn good! When I have a craving for some poutine, whether it be lunch or dinner, US Fries has become my go to. I like that they have different topping creations, I've had the Philly Cheesesteak, Pork three ways and the Cheeseburger, and I think my personal fave is the Cheesesteak because it seems less heavy than the cheeseburger. I swear they pack the small order (which is substantial for anyone who has a hearty appetite) with so much ground beef and cheese and curds that it's too much! The cheesesteak on the other hand has a right balance of meat, peppers and curds. Another awesome thing about US Fries is that they sell Eegees! Yay they sell it but I dislike it's one size which is a large cup. They have three flavors and flavor of the month in addition.   Overall, it's a good place to grab some poutine, enjoy scrumptious fries, and have a refreshing eegee, it's a great addition to the Mill Avenue food scene!

A genuine ramen shop has finally arrived! I've been here twice, and both times I've been satisfied! Their broth is so good, and isn't salty unlike other places that serve ramen. If I were to rank the places in Phoenix who have the best ramen, it would be Tampopo, Posh (Tuesday nights), DOZO, and CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe.   I've had the Tonkotsu ramen, and the Soymilk ramen both with the braised pork belly, and it's superb. The noodles are a bit al dente but you know it's the real deal since they're made in house, and you can see the machine they make it with in the small room close to the entrance. The Hirata Buns are good too, as well as the Japanese fried chicken, the grilled squid tentacles, and the gyoza. All good appetizers. I'm looking forward to trying their rice and curry dishes. So, if you have a hankering for a hot bowl of ramen, get your fix at Tampopo! Yum!
