I love this place! Great food, service, atmosphere, and prices that cannot be beat! There sushi is some of the best I have had in town.  Everything is fresh and flavorful.  I have been to quite a few different places here in Phoenix and this is one of my all time favorites.  I have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed!  Highly recommend to first time visitors and seasoned sushi connoisseurs ;) I will be back in for more soon!

One of my all time favorite Chinese takeout places!   I have moved away from Madison and still crave the food.  My sister and I would eat there at least once a week and every time I come home I make it a point to stop here.  I recommend the vegetarian broccoli dish and my sister is obsessed with General Tso's Chicken. I also love hot Jasmine tea they have for you while you wait.  Perfect to cut through the crisp (emphasis) Wisconsin air. ;)  If you are looking for a great takeout place look no further!

Bottom line- Wine lover's heaven!  The place has an old school speakeasy feel.  I LOVE the wine list and live jazz music.  The crowd is very diverse (age, culture) and has a relaxed, sophisticated, yet non-pretentious vibe.   I recommend trying the different wine flights...found many new favorites that way!  I have been here numerous times and have never had less than a wonderful experience.

Bottom line- Decent wine selection, generous pours, with a laid back atmosphere   I have stopped in several times with family and have not left disappointed.  Typically we come late Sunday afternoon 3-4 pm.  The place is quite and the waitstaff is laid back, but friendly.  The chairs are comfortable and the wine pours are VERY generous.  All major pluses!  Easy place to kick back, put your "feet up" and chat.  I love the cheese and bruschetta plates! They compliment a lot of the wines perfectly.    Great place to stop in savor a drink and munch on the wonderful finger food :)

Best Vegan restaurant in AZ!  Bottom line if you want great vegan food this is the place to go! The restaurant also features local artists from the community, which I love. I have even brought some of my meat eating friends here (they either love it or hate it).  I am not sure that I would describe the food as "healthy", but if you are in the mood for a fat-kid veggie comfort-food fix this is your place.  I am sad they are not open on Sundays!   Huge fan of  -Drunken mushroom chicken -The green salad (that is what it is called),  -Buffalo chicken wings.  -Poboy  Would skip -Crab puff (I am in the minority here...my friends are obsessed with them) -The taco special (bleh)

Really love this place- the food and service is solid.    Perfect place for a large get-together.   Our waitstaff has been nothing short of excellent each time. There is truly something for everyone on the menu, which is important when your friends all have picky taste buds!  The bars of zin = chocolate nirvana!

Beautiful ambiance, wonderful service, decent wine list, and flavorful dishes.  The salmon and mashed potatoes are to die for!  There sangria is also very good... this is one of the few places I have found that doesn't over-sugar or water down the drink. Solid choice for a romantic date or to catch up with friends.   Our favorite waiter remembers to bring out separate dishes for the pesto dip (delish!).  It really is the little things that make a place stand out!  Only downside is the drink orders can take +10 minutes.  If you are in a hurry don't eat here.  Live a little, relax, and enjoy the meal.  It is worth the wait!

I am surprised at how many positive reviews this place has received.  I was so excited to try this place because others had talked up how good it was. I live in Phoenix and the selection of sushi restaurants there is phenomenal!  I went here for lunch with my sister and ordered a lunch special.  I tried to force it down, but was unable to.  Maybe they were having an off day or the sushi was old...either way I will not be back to find out.

There are some places that just wow you with their customer service, this was one of them.   I happened to get a flat tire shortly after leaving my condo.  In a state of panic I pulled into Danny's car wash... It was shredded to bits!  While I was weighing my options, a few of the staff happened to come by and offered to help me out.  They changed the tire and bent out my rim. This happened almost a year ago, but I was so taken back by the level of customer service I had to leave a comment.  Not sure about the car wash, but I can comment that their service is second to none. Thanks again! :)

Bottom line-  Consistently good healthy food!   I have visited here over a dozen times and typically walk away feeling full, but not overly so.  I love the organic drink menu and if you are in the mood, the organic vodka ;) Place is veggie, vegan, and gluten-free friendly.  Service is a little scattered at times, but nothing notably bad.  The sunday brunch is also excellent.  The mock chorizo is amazing!!
