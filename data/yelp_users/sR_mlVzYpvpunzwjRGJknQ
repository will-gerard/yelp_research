I finaly fell for the trap of Cooperstown! I heard from multiple people that Cooperstown was the greatest, Not only am i embarrassed that i went there i will never go back!.......To Start off we waited for about 20 minutes for our table which is reasonable , but when we sat down we didn't see our waiter for about another 10 minutes! I know it is a sports bar and it is going to be noisy but this was just unreal! The T.V.'s where turned up so loud that we couldn't talk to each other at our own table! After trying we resulted to just sitting there watching the T.V.'s without talking to each other! We even asked a worker if they could turn down the Sound just a little bit and they said it could not be done! I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and it was one of the worst i have ever had! It honestly tasted like school cafeteria food! The fries where some of the worst i have had! i do not know how you can mess up french fries but they easily managed that! Then in the end i had to pay for all that! I will never go back! Dont fall for the Trap like me!

Stratum is the place to go if you are looking to play laser tag! The facilities are really nice and all the employes were great! it can get pretty pricy though! It was about $7 a game! which adds up if you are wanting to play more then one! Last time i went i saw a sign saying that they do "All Nighter" For $20 bucks! I think it was for about 2-3 hours? somewhere in there! but that is the way i would do it, if i wanted to play for a long time! you would save money in the long run! But it is great for the whole family young and old it doesn't matter your age your going to have fun! I will defiantly go back!

I haven't been to Chili's in many years I was very impressed with my experience. All of our food was great and our service was awesome! I really wasn't expecting that from Chili's. I will be back for sure!

I hadn't been to Red Robin in a very long time i went this past week and was not disappointed. I remember going there all the time growing up but it had been a while since i had been. When i went this last time i got the blue ribbon burger. it had a patty, with blue cheese crumbles and fried onion stings, then all of the fixings. I thought it was an incredible burger. Then the stake fries that had where great and they kept on bringing them out. One of my friends that came with told me that i had to get their honey mustered to dip my fries in. Their honey mustered was perhaps the best honey mustered i have ever had. Defiantly try it, after all it is free.

I have always been a HUGE fan of Schlotzskys! I remember going often when i was a kid! The food is still good tasty today! I think the icing on the cake for me is their Sourdough bread it is as good as it gets! I have yet to find better Sourdough bread! Also the combination of their sandwiches with their hot sauce! It never disappoints! If you are looking for a good sandwich place i recommend Schlotzskys!

I have been using Norm's Watch Repair for years! They have always done a professional job at a fair price. I have had some big and small problems with my watches and they have taken care of it with no problems. I will continue to use Norm's in the future

I have driven by Chen's Chinese Restaurant countless times. I was craving Chinese food so I decided on going to Chen's. I have been looking for a new Chinese restaurant   to add to my cycle of restaurants. This is defiantly a place I will go back to; here is why:  Price- We went for lunch and the price was very low for how much food we got. I did not even come close to eating all my food. I don't know what their dinner prices are but there lunch prices are fantastic.   Food - The food was spot on! Do I need to say more??  Service - My water cup got refilled multiple times before I was empty. We didn't have to wait for anything. It was how service should be at any restaurant.

I LOVE the pizza here! Even better though are their WINGS! I have been going to Rino D's for as long as i can remember! I have never been dissatisfied when i have gone! They really do not have much of a sit-down and eat. Either get it for pick up or delivery. If you are looking for a new pizza places or just GREAT pizza Rino D's is the spot!

Nando's is great! To start off their chips and salsa are great. Not only are they free but they are not stingy with them they will keep bringing them out till you say no more. Everything is good on their menu, but my personal favorite is their Pizza Blanco. It is a mexican pizza with cream cheese, chicken, tomato's, chiles, onions and cheese. You wont be disappointed at all. Carful if you get the pizza Blanco you will want to order that every time you go, you will have no other choice but to order it, it is that good!

Salt River Tubing has been a summer tradition of mine for some time! As someone that lives right next door to the Salt river site it is hard to pass up! There is really not much to it, just sit in your tube and enjoy the ride!  Things you will more then likely experience.... lots of drinking, loud music, marshmallow fights, crazy drunk people all of it add to the experience! GO and have a good time! It is one of the few outdoor summer things to do in the East Valley

We went to Yama sushi hoping to score some great sushi off the strip but we were sorely disappointed! The price for the all you can eat sushi was good, $20-25 a person is great when getting all you can eat.  if you are looking for quantity of food this is the route to go. If you are looking for quality sushi I would not eat at Yama. Between our group we probably tried 3/4 of the specialty sushi on the menu and we were not impressed at all! All of the sushi was just MEH not that good. I will never go back to Yama there was nothing there for me there.

Somehow i have gone by whole entire life without going or even hearing much about of La Grande Orange Pizzeria. After always seeing great reviews on my Yelp home page I decided that i had to go and give it a shot!  None of us in our group had been there before so we had no idea what to expect. We all had a fantastic time at LGO! When we showed up we had to wait 20 minutes so we went next door to the grocery store, the time flew by while we where over there. With all the things to look at, it was the fastest 20 minutes of my life.  Our food was beyond delicious and our service was great! I cannot say anything bad! If you haven't been before you gotta go! I will defiantly be back

Phoenicia Grill is where you need to go if you are looking for some good Greek food! I love this place! I am a huge Gyro fan and this is one or the best places that I have found for Gyros in the East Valley. Phoenicia grill also has hands down the best Greek fries you will ever have! Your body won't thank you for eating them but you will enjoy them! If you go I recommend the gyro and fries combo! It is my personal favorite

We went to Bj's this past weekend we enjoyed our experience. First off I ordered a cream soda and I am now convinced that Bj's has the best cream soda out there, you gotta try it when you go. Our group shared a pizza it was very good, i would defiantly order it again. Our service was good, nothing to brag about but nothing to complain about either. We will defiantly be back!

I have been going to Mango's for years! The food is great! The service is great as well! I have never left Mango's feeling disappointed or ripped off! Everything i have gotten there has been great! It can get really croweded during the lunch and dinner rushes, so if you are short on time watch out! They also ONLY accept cash, i think they just started that just recently, a friend had to spot me last time because i didn't have any cash, so make sure you bring cash!

My Personal favorite bowling spot! They have a ton of lanes (double what a normal bowling ally would have). They keep their facilities always clean. Only downfalls is that it can get crowded but same can any other bowling ally, and they seem to be more expensive then any of the other bowling ally's around, but they are always having good deals so you can bowl for less. Defiantly recommend it if you are going to go bowling any time soon.

If you are looking for great New Mexican Food Blue Adobe is the place to go! We have been going there for a few years now and have never been disappointed! The food is great! To Start off the Chips and Salsa are out of this world good! I could easily just eat there Chips and Salsa for a meal! Anything you get on there Menu will be good! i have never gotten anything bad! My personal favorite is the "Land Of Enchantment"! It is a Tenderloin, with Green Chile potato, vegetables and Shrimp! It is kinda pricey but well worth it!! If you wanna try a new good place to eat Go to Blue Adobe!

Sushi here is great! I went with 2 other friends and they liked it as well. They had some great specials that we really enjoyed. Our bill was not every expensive for all of the food that we got. Also our service was great, i never had to wait for our waitress to fill up our drinks they were always on top of it.  If you are looking for a spicy roll; we got the Salmon Bomber it was VERY spicy but delicious. I defiantly recommend this one if you are looking for something with some kick to it. We will defiantly be returning customers!

I am always weary of new pizza places but i really enjoyed Queens! We got our pizzas to go, one pizza was just a pepperoni, and the other was along the lines of an everything pizza; our group like the everything pizza the most. The slices there are really big kinda different then what you get from the normal pizza chains. The pizza was great, my friends and I all said that we would come back!

First off, i live and die for sushi! i love it! i try different sushi places all the time! But RA falls short in my eyes! I do not feel like there is anything special with RA, it was just in the middle for me! it wasn't good! And it wasn't bad! it was just whatever! However the service when we went was awful! We went during the happy hour on a Monday night and it was packed! It took about an hour to get our food! An another 20 minutes to get our Check after we had already given our server our credit card! It was just too slow and my drink did not get refilled one time! After that last experience i am not sure if i will ever go back!

Teharu is defiantly a different way to experience sushi in the valley that will keep you coming back! The Sushi is ok, its not bad by any means but it is not special either, but Teharu makes up in the price and in the service! Last time i went for 2 people the bill was under $20 (without tip) and we were both full to the brim! Other Sushi places i can spend $20 bucks easy on my self! The atmosphere of the Teharu is very cool, being able to pick and choose what you want when it rolls right by you makes it really fun! i defiantly recommend Teharu to anyone that enjoys Sushi!

I shop oat Sprouts because of the products they carry and they usually have good prices. The last few times I have gone the food was less then fresh. I couldn't find any chicken worth getting. I got the best chicken I could find and I was very disappointed after I cooked it.  The veggies I usually get were not fresh either. Usually I am happy with Sprouts but It may be time to go elsewhere. Thanks Sprouts we had a good run.

I Love Filly-B's! The food is great! It is cheap! Open 24 hours! you can't ask for more! The food is be horrible to my heath! I am surprised i have not gotten violently sick from eating there!  But i am willing to take that risk when i eat at Filibertos! If you get hungry and night and nothing else is open Fillys is the place to go! I feel like crap every time i eat there but it is 100% worth it!

We went for the BAD Bingo and was not disappointed! It was a great way to spend a Saturday night! This was my first time ever playing bingo and I was surprisingly  entertained! Lone Butte had a great DJ, awesome lights, and it was lots of fun! I never had the chance to yell bingo but i still had a ton of fun! Our group did the digital bingo where the game plays itself and you do not have to worry about it, it is the only way I would play!  it was extremely crowded when we showed up and we had to wait in line for about 30 minutes, I guess that is to expected when there is lot of people trying to play. I would defiantly go back for bingo well worth it!

I love Casanova Brothers Pizza! I went for the first time this last week and i was truely impressed! I live right in that area and i am embarrassed i did not know about Casanova Brothers before! This Might be my new favirote pizza place in Gilbert! The Food was amazing and the price was more then reasonable! I went for lunch and they had a few specials that you can choose from for a cheap price! The Pizza is NYC style and it feels like you are in New York when you eat there! I would recomand this place to anyone that enjoys pizza or just food in general!

Do your self a favor and do not eat here! I am disappointed in my self for not reading yelp reviews before hand. It was not the worst tasting food i have ever had, but it ranks at the same level as gas station food for me. I have a friend that lives and dies for Pete's Fish and Chips, so maybe I just had a bad experience ( probably not though after reading all of the negative reviews). I have no desire to go back, the only reason I would go back is to prove to my friend that this place is a bust.

It must of just not been my day because I got dragged back by a friend and now i love it! I get the Italian and Steamer almost every time! You could not ask for a better sandwich! I also throw the Caption Sorenson sauce on! It is crazy good! I was a hater now i am a lover!

Best place in the valley when it comes to gambling! Just as good as any Casino In Las Vegas. They have a huge poker room, lots of BlackJack tables, multiple  roulette machines, a craps machine and countless Slot Machines.  Every time I have gone it has been very clean and the dealers have been extremely nice. I have been to many of the Casinos in the valley and Talking Stick has been my favorite!

There is no real way to say this but........ROCKET BURGER IS ONE OF THE BEST BURGER PLACES IN AZ! Hands down the best burger there has to be the New Yorker! It has a patty, pastrami, cole slaw, and rocket sauce! I didn't even know a burger could be that good! The fries and onion rings are great too, i would not  call them the best but they are enjoyable! If you like to try different kinds of soda this is the place to go! They have any kind of bottled soda you can think of! Every time i have gone i have gotten a new soda i have never heard of before! The management there is great! A friend of mine got a bottled soda and didn't like it, they saw him about to throw it away and they said just to grab another soda free of charge! The workers there are really cool! I recommend this place to any one that is a burger lover! i live in Mesa and anytime i am out by Rocket Burger i will go out of my way to stop in! I highly recommend it!

Food was very good! I split the Kobe burger and the Mac N Cheese with a friend because we had to try both. Both were great will you will be happy with either of them.  I did not order any of the deserts but some people in our group ordered Milkshakes and they LOVED them! Max Brenner is defiantly worth giving a shot!

I am a huge fan of Capriotti's! My two personal favorite sandwiches are Capastrami (which is pastrami Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and cole slaw). Then the Bobbie which is ( Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo). Both are incredibly good i always have a hard time deciding between the two when i go. The service has always been good, and they make their sandwiches very quickly. They do a great job. The restaurant  is always clean and same with their bathrooms. I love this place! The only thing i wish changed was their prices. They are a little pricy for what you get but their food does outweigh their price, at least for me.

This place rocks! I found this place on my last trip to downtown Mesa and i'm glad I did.  Gotham City Comics has everything and more you could ever want from a comic book store. The staff were very friendly and helped me find what I was looking for. Anytime I need comics I know where I will be going from now on!

I really enjoyed my self at IPic when i went! i had heard from a few friends that i got to check it out! I was impressed with everything but the price! It was really expensive i paid $25 dollars for a movie just for my self! But it was really fun! It was nice being able to pick our seats online and know where we are going to sit even before we get there! The Seats where out of this world! i felt like i was on my lazy boy back at my house! it was cool having a server you are defiantly pampered there.....for a fee! I really enjoyed my self there, i would love to go there more often but it is really expense! i would defiantly go more if the prices where a little bit lower!

GREAT GELATO!! If you do not know anything about Gelato you need to check this place out!! It is some of the best Gelato/ ice cream/ frozen yogurt i have had in a long time! If you go on the Weekend Night you are going to have to wait in line! Last time i went it the line was out the door! We waited for 15 minutes, Well worth the wait! Do not be turned off by the line! You will be happy you waited!

Finally went to Postinos after many people telling me how good it is. I went in with high exceptions and i was let down. Our food was overpriced and honestly not that good.  We ate on the patio and the misters were leaking on us, my friends pants where completely soaked, the service was ok but nothing special. There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better

FlipSide has hands down the best laser tag I have ever been too! It was a little bit out of the way but well worth the drive! We went at night and it was just our group playing laser tag that made it even more fun! We also tried their laser maze that flipSide has and that was a riot! Definitely worth going!
