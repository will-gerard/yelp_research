Really nice tex-mex.  Inside looked very nice, and I'm sure the natives flock to the AC, but as tourists, of course, we sat outside.  Remarkable homemade chips, some corn, some sweet potato, some something else, all very good.  Salsa was a bit on the tomatoe side for my taste, but good nonetheless.  The approach is a bit off-putting since it's upstairs fo a mall, but once inside it's just classy tex-mex and a step above avegare at that.

Just about as good as a steak house can get, this place would be right at home in NY, Chicago or even DC.  First and foremost, excellent meat.  All the other goodies that go into making a good steak into a great steak house experience were there too.  Nice decor, open an dinviting.  Great service.  Huge wine list with options from budget to Bill Gates.  Creamed spinach and chocolate lava cake.  All good things.  Suprisingly, its a chain.  There is another in Tucson that is just as good.

Good bar food.  We ordered lots.  Sliders were hamd made patties on nice buns, tuna sliders were blackened and tasty, I got nothing bad to say about the chicken wings, and that's saying something, steak skewers were a bit dry, avodado dip was ok.  beer was ... well ... beer.  Right in the middle of a stretch of college hangouts, this one was a bit more upscale.  Plenty of people without being oppressive.  Gotta valet around back or park far away.

Retro is the word.  Looks like it got a great face lift about 1971 but hasn't changed much since.  Fantastic spot for a conference, but for a destination resort probably not your best bet.  Service definitely did not follow the "customer is king" philosophy.  Great omeltte though.
