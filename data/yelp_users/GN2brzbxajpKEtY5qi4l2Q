Amazing company!  Jason was our towing expert and he saved the day!  He arrived in record time and was so pleasant.  Our one date night for the semester (we have two young boys) was salvaged and we had a great story to tell. Thank you Valley Towing!! :)

Jeff is the most amazing, personable, and efficient locksmith in the valley.  What an incredible attention to detail and customer service. He had my locks changed in record time and for an incredibly reasonable price.  He is without a doubt THE BEST.  Settle for no one else but my man Jef!!!

HORRIBLE experience with these "people."  Started out fine when asst. manager Greg took my lens information and help me choose frames.  Nice enough.  I let them know about my need for an accelerated time frame to receive the frames due to a trip.  Was not informed about the possibility of a rush order.  Was treated very rudely by front desk staff when I called to inquire about my glasses a week later.  Was told that there was nothing they could do at all and I was going to need to go on my trip without my glasses.    I left for my trip and, on the 11th day without new glasses called and was informed that the glasses had just arrived.  This was on Wednesday.  Greg agreed to ship the glasses, BUT I wouldn't receive them until early the NEXT WEEK.  That's close to 3 weeks since the date of purchase.  I finally had to ask my husband to pick up the glasses and ship them to me, OUT OF POCKET, in order to receive them in time to be able to see for only half my trip, which was an educational journey requiring intensive learning and long vision (which I DO NOT have).    When my husband arrived to pick up the glasses he was treated disrespectfully:  He was not greeted and left alone at the desk for 5 minutes, finally having to get there attention as they stood right next to him.   Then, Greg did not answer any of his questions, rather, he smiled at him and told him to "be patient, you need to wait" when he asked a respectful question.  DID NOT receive ANY answers.  My husband finally informed the staff that we would not be patronizing their services again.  Thank GOD I even received the glasses at all.  I haven't even been able to put them on yet, let's hope they are the correct prescription.  What an AWFUL experience and I am not even in town to deal with it.  THANKS FOR NOTHING!!!!!!!!  DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!  AMATEUR NIGHT!!

Amazing!  Jim is an incredible, hands on instructor who truly gets "it."  He makes students feel comfortable as supported, while attending to the spiritual component of yoga practice.  I felt challenged, exercised and centered after class.  Love this environment, will be back soon!

AMAZING staff!  These folks took my ornery, upset 4 year old at 8:00am and didn't bat an eye when he gave them everything he had.  They were thorough with explaining his treatment plan and being so positive with him even though he was struggling.  I am so grateful for these loving and amazing people!  The office is gorgeous and totally stocked for a child-focused environment.  THANK YOU!
