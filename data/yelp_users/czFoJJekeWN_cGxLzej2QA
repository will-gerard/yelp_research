This is my go to place near work for some Pad Thai.  I am a huge fan of their Veggie Pad Thai or their Pad Thai in general.  Always a fan when craving Thai.  Their Thai Ice Tea is also delish!

I was excited to see this place open for two reasons.   1. I am a big fan of cupcakes 2. It's close to my house  I love red velvet cakes and decided to try that one.  Little to say I was disappointed.  The cupcake was lacking in flavor and consistency.  It felt a little dense as other reviewers had mentioned.  I wasn't also a fan of the filling inside.  I was also hoping for a better presentation with the frosting.  The frosting on top was good, that at least saved the cupcake for me.  I won't write this place off, but hoping the other flavors are more redeeming.
