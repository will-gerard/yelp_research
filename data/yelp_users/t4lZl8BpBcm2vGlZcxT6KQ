***Discount Tire Review*** (tatum/bell) I have been going there since I got my first car and today I just received the worst service!  I asked them to check my tires, I have about 30k miles on them. Guy walks out to my car looks at them walks around car and says yep they look good, you have Michelins! OK great, the guy didn't even bend over to measure tread. Me "ok well maybe I will pull around to get air check" I was guided into the bay by another guy an he just walks away.....sat there for a few minutes and no one acknowledged, me, I just left, still no acknowledgement as I was backing out! I am not a stupid girl when it comes to these things and I know how the process works!

Nothing really to do with the service there but when I got gas an paid at the pump it charged my debit card $100 hold fee... I called an they said that's what the pay at the pumps there do, we'll post a big sign!

We had dinner at Malee's tonight for our girls dinner. We took advantage of the happy hour an dinner menu. We were all greated at the door friendly and smiling workers. We had a party of 5 an all showed up at different time, our waitress Oi was there everytime another person walked in to take the drink order. The food was fabulous as well as the service, I would give 10 stars if I could. The dragon princess was my fav!

We went there with a group of girls to have happy hour an dinner, we sat up by the bar due to the dining room being full, which was fine, great out door patio. Happy hour ended at 6pm we were there at 5 pm to enjoy in the specials. The water girl was right on it but when it came to getting drinks we had to flag the server down an then flag him down again for appetizers,  then for a 3rd an 4th time to order dinner an more drinks! The food was awsome,  I had the beef tenderloin which melted in my mouth. The "trick" is that the servers never ask how anything was or if you need anything such as silverware an you have to hunt them down!  We spent $225 for a party of 4 an I expected way better service for that!  Sorry about the low tip! I would return if I could get it as take out cause the service was horrible!

I love trying new places, it was our Girl's dinner night,great pick! The place is really cozy and the owner Gregory was our server! He spoke about his Mom which many of the recipes were hers and everything her recommend was spectacular. We had the calamari an stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, awsome! Then we proceeded to have the trio to taste a little bit of every. They made us feel like we were part of the family. I will definitely be back.

It was my first time there an I thought the food was awesome,  I had the build a burger an we all shared 3 different kinds of fries.  The cheese curds were the bomb!!! They could of had a little more help, our server was the bartender an the waiter, I think for the whole place but he took care of us pretty good!  Can't wait to go back!
