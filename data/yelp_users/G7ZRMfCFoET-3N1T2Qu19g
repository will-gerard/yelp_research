If I could eat Yogis 7 nights a week... I dont think it would be enough. Friendly faces and great food! Of all of their locations Ellsworth is the best!

We have been looking for a Thai place close to home and Thai Chili has been wonderful. They even deliver! The Yellow Curry is amazing and their Pad Thai is wonderful but normally that's hard to screw up. Every time we call and order Ray answers and is very kind and helpful!

No X rays and no medical advice. Ability to walk in is convenient, but if you want someone with no knowledge of whats actually wrong with you then you might as well ask a stranger to pick you up and crack you at the bar. Went to seek out professional help after 2 months of the joint only to find out that my back was getting worse. Just because you receive the sensation of Cracking doesn't mean its actually helping. Ive cancelled my account but due to their Gym style membership I have to spend another 30 days with 4 wasted sessions because I refuse go back in.

Was looking forward to finding a record store near work in Scottsdale. Record Room had a decent selection but the help was terrible. 30 year old hipster refused to help anyone in the store. Indicating he was busy when truly he was probably playing fruit ninja on his phone. Causing numerous customers to walk out.  ZIA REMAINS THE ANSWER TO MY VINYL NEEDS
