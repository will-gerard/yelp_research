I have to say that Dr Brian Archambault is the best doctor I have ever met. He was absolutely nothing short of spectacular when treating my mother. I truly believe she lived a couple more years because of Dr Brian.  She had stage 4 cancer and his treatments gave me more time with my mother for sure. The other tradition medical doctors had written her off.   She lit up whenever she saw Dr Brian. I have never met a more compassionate man, let alone a Dr.  Dr Brian has been a blessing to our family, I can not find the words that would do Dr Brian justice.  I highly recommend West Valley Naturopathic Center

Dreaming Summit Animal Hospital is the WORST!!!  1st time I went to Dreaming Summit Animal Hospital I arrived 15 mins early and waited 40 mins after my appointment time to go into a room and then waited 20 mins for someone to see my dog.   So my 2nd visit I was running a little late I called, and they said if I am more than 10 mins late I'd have to pay an extra $20 or reschedule. I couldn't believe it, I said last time I had to wait an hour after my appointment time to see someone and you can't give me a break because I am 15-20 mins late?   I regrettably decided to go in anyway, and pay the extra $20. Now it is 40 mins after I got here and still waiting.  This place is the worst.   Ok after an hour I got up and asked how much longer should it be? They said we may have an opening at 11:40 it was 10:40. I said to them, you said you were going to "work me in", not wait until cancels or  someone doesn't show up. Why didn't they say that instead of we will work you in...  I gave them a second chance and they failed...Also be aware that they have a resident cat that just roams around the lobby waiting area, I was a little shocked because almost all of the dogs started barking and flipping out.   On a positive note the Vets were pretty nice my 1st visit, thats why I came back a 2nd time, but the staff up front made me decide I will never go back there again!!  How can they make you wait over an hour when you have an appointment and then if you are over 10 mins late they charge you an extra $20 and then don't tell you how the process works and you have to wait for someone not to show up?? If they would have told me up front that someone would have to cancel or no show for me to be seen, instead they said they'd "work me in", I would have opted to reschedule and come back another time. There was NO COMMUNICATION that I could wait 2 hours+  to be seen.  Bottom line if you are retired and/or have nothing better to do with your time, then by all means check them out. If you value your time even just a little then, STAY AWAY from Dreaming Summit Animal Hospital http://www.dreamingsummitah.com/ They are Bad News!!!

Cory was great!!! He knew what was going on with my unit right away, and he had it fixed in no time. I was amazed at how good his customer service was, they didn't try to up sell my on things I didn't need. It is nice to find people in business that operate with honesty and integrity!!  Maxon Air will be my go to company for all my A/C needs!!!
