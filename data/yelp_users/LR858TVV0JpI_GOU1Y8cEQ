This is what professionalism is all about.  Venna was my sales person and she was excellent, light and friendly, treated me like a friend, not just a number.  I met with Matt the manager who ACTUALLY took the time to come to me and ask me about my experience and even exchange a little friendly dialogue.  Unlike other dealerships (that I have reviewed here) Audi North Scottsdale took the time to help me and guide me through the buying process.  When I went to the finance person I told him that I was going to say "no" to everything, that I just wanted to sign the paperwork and get out of there, he got me through the process in a very timely manner.    Thank you for listening! I'll be back and I'll tell my friends.

First of all I hope that nobody needs to see an emergency vet.  We had a brand new puppy, he wasn't feeling well and we took him in.  They were straight forward with us, explained what the treatment options were and the costs and risks associated with all of them.  We decided to hospitalize him and go for the full treatment as we had just lost a family dog and couldn't risk any additional heartbreak.  1st pet was fantastic, they updated us regularly, patiently answered our many questions and took care of our pup as if he were theirs.  Trust them to help you in a very scary time, it worked for us!

I would give zero if I could. Their check-in online system means nothing, twice I've been here, checked in and they just take whoever they want in whatever order. Bring it to their attention and they offer no apology.  I won't be back.

Tom's is legit!!!! Their bone-in smoked chicken has to be the best chicken I've ever had. The brisket is great, excellent sides too. Potato salad, jalape√±o Mac n cheese..... They are VERY friendly, table side delivery after a counter order. These local Tempe businesses need us, keep them open. Enjoy Tom's, you'll be glad you did.

Nothing special, it's a little bit of cheese with flavorless sauce on a saltine cracker.  They hype is out of control with this place, don't believe it and certainly don't be one of those fools who wait 3 hours for the privilege of dining at a"pizza" spot that doesn't have pepperoni or meatballs as options, at all.  That's just not pizza.

Boooooo!  Walked in, sat at the kitchen back bar area for five minutes, we weren't even greeted.  We figured that we must have to sit around the other side so we got up, walked around and stood around looking lost for another five minutes.  There isn't a way to tell who works there and who doesn't in the sea of skinny jeans plaid shirts and black rimmed glasses so we finally left.    I've eaten here before, the food is pretty good but customer service is more important than food.  I'll take my dollar and properly fitting pants somewhere else.

The all you can eat dinner option is worth every cent.  They are attentive, quick and everything is delicious.  Be sure to get the "who's your daddy?"  It's the best roll I've ever had. The only reason this place isn't 5 stars all around is because the atmosphere is a little bland.  Check it out, eat your face off and thank me when you do.

Came in for a child's birthday party, they put us in the corner, they had the entire other side of the building closed off. They then proceeded to put a group of guys drinking and using foul language right next to the 4 year olds birthday. Again, why was the ENTIRE other side of the building closed off? The food/beverage service is slow and inconsistent, the seating is ripped, needs replaced, portions of the floor are totally worn out. The lack of compassion for a small child's birthday group is motivation enough for me not to return, don't make the same mistake we made.

Awesome sandwiches!  The meatball is as good as it gets.  They have kids meals and a clean place to eat with the family.  Fast, good,  affordable.  What more could you want?

Sushi Time is as good as it gets! I live nearby and go at least once a week for happy hour.  Their happy hour specials are buy one get one rolls and buy a beer get a free hot saki!! for less than $40 two people can have 3-4 rolls and a couple of drinks each.  The food is excellent, the decor is simple, not much for atmosphere but you won't find better sushi in the area.  Score one for mom and pop!!

Breakfast sandwich heaven!!!!! Great prices, amazing food. Get the breakfast sandwich on the sandwich roll as opposed to the toast, it's incredible. They have an amazing looking selection of pastries and sweets too. I can't wait to go back and try their lunch and desserts.

Aloha is clean, the staff is super friendly and it's hard to come twice in a row without seeing new flavors.  They always have kids movies playing to entertain the youngsters.  The toppings are unique, fresh and delicious.  It's a neighborhood gem, if you live nearby stop-in and meet some neighbors.

I would give zero if possible. I played on Sunday 2/22 and we quit after it took 3 hours to play 10 holes. There was not a cart girl there (even though we were told there would be) the marshals did nothing to speed up play. After leaving early we were even insulted by the cart guys when we grabbed our bags and walked off because they "really love working for $6 an hour" I would've gone in and asked for a rain check but I don't want to return even if it was free. Save your $$$ don't play here.

It's an awkward place, the tables are too close together and the decor is very unattractive. The staff could use some training especially in the food handling area. The hostess was coughing excessively into her hands and then without hesitation grabbed our menus and silverware with those same hands. There was some young man that walked around in circles with his hands in his pockets and then grabbed our water glasses way up by the rim to refill them.  The food was average, everyone seemed nice but I just couldn't get over the lack of basic understanding of food handling principles.

I would rather swan dive into a pool of razor blades than ever fly them again. I am a loyal customer (former) that flew over 30K miles a year and will NEVER fly them again.  They tried to charge me $269 to switch from a round trip to a one-way flight by only cancelling the out leg of the trip. I was essentially giving them 2 additional seats to sell and they were going to charge me so that they could double up on the profit. I'm embarrassed for how long I was loyal to them. Said good things about them to friends and family and this is the thanks I get.  NEVER AGAIN.

Excellent food, excellent service! Amber is an asset to this place, she is genuinely passionate about her efforts.  I enjoyed the food, the cozy atmosphere and it was even great to hear some Christian music on the radio.  The portions are HUGE so be ready for that.  We will be back!

Kid friendly and great food items.  They have all the bar regulars plus a nice foodie touch to their menu.  Dishes come out looking great and tasting better.  Wait staff handled special orders easily and cheerfully.  Check this place out, keep it busy, don't let tempe lose a nice local spot!!

Missed appts. don't brush the pool or add chemicals as requested and agreed upon.  They flooded my backyard by leaving the hose on.  On top of that when we contacted them to remedy the issue they couldn't have cared less.  Avoid them.

Just what the neighborhood needs! In an area full of divey bars (they are great but not always what I want) this is a welcome change of pace.  The atmosphere is awesome, tons of room inside and out and very nice decor.  Very good liquor and beer selection, very friendly staff.  We will see you there!

I've tried three times, first time good, second  time average, third time horrible... They can't even get kids Mac n cheese right... Everything was slow, we arrived at 6pm, ordered at 6:30 and finally ate at 8:30.... I want this place to succeed, it won't, I live across the street and I won't be back.  They take forever, and then a little longer.  Save yourself the time and misery, eat somewhere else. We had to request silverware, request salt and pepper and then after several "updates" from our waiter the food finally came out dry, cold and bad.... I want to give a good review, I can't.

South Tempe.... We have tried every other groomer around and met disappointment after disappointment. Doggie District is the answer, from the moment they walked in they made us feel like our pups were the only dogs there, they listened to how we wanted our dogs cut and did a perfect job. Take your dogs to Doggie District, you won't regret it.

I wish I could write a zero.  They clearly don't give a damn about good service, they'll survive on Friday and Saturday alone so they can suck all week.  I brought in 10 guys on a Monday night.  They messed up 10 orders.  As slow as possible with everything wrong.  Stay away? Go somewhere that they care about customers, this isn't your place.

I don't know what the complainers on here are thinking.  BR is good, really good, like legendary old burger stand good.  I had the colossal burger, it's huge, stacked with pastrami.  Everything was cooked perfectly and it was fairly quick (not mcdonalds quick) made from scratch quick.  They have enough options that if you ordered something you don't like then you probably didn't take the time to craft the right order.  The staff took the time to help us newbies with the menu and made awesome suggestions.  Give them a chance, it's a good joint that we need in Tempe.  They also DELIVER!

Ike's is unreal. After one bite you'll agree that it's the best sandwich you've ever had. A sandwich goes for over $10 but it's worth it because it's 2 meals, it's a big sandwich. Get the Dutch crunch bread!  Mill ave. is having a huge resurgence and Ike's is a big part of it.

Unbelievably unreasonable business practice. They won't take reservations for a group over 12..... How does that make any sense? "We will take your money if there are 12 of you, but we don't want the extra money from the other 8." Business must be so good that they just don't need loyal customers or groups.....  Won't be back.

The food was good, I just took issue with what how they decided to handle a challenge. I ordered my lunch and was given the option of white or brown rice, I chose brown. I was never notified of an issue with my choice and when the waiter brought the food, he dropped it and said "we are out of brown, it will take 15 minutes to cook so I got you white." He never asked if that was ok, never mentioned the problem until my food was in front of me.  On top of that there was no apology or service recovery. I just felt it was just handled poorly with little regard for my happiness.
