My favorite pizza in Gilbert. The margherita pizza is my absolute favorite. A lot of people shy away of review negatively because their pizza is NOT like commercial pizza chains. It is fresh and delicious. They have pretty good specials as well. Definitely my go-to pizza place!

I just ordered a cheese pizza to go one Friday night. Absolutely delicious pizza! The crust is chewy and flavorful and the sauce was perfection. The place is really cool inside as well, I can't wait to get a group together to go over. I am such a pizza junkie so it's tough to please me but this place is top notch!

Why can't I give 0 stars for this? Because that's what it deserves. I guess the 1 star can be for the installer who came out.  Let me tell you...pissed doesn't even begin to cover how I feel. I know this is a big company with a semi-monopoly in the Phoenix area but they are literally the worst company I've dealt with. The sales rep was fine...until the installer came out and I found out she completely misrepresented the company and the services i would be receiving. She basically low balled me to get some kind of sales commission. Why should I pay $20 monthly for something I could get with free bunny ears from goodwill?  When calling to get this fixed I was put on hold for 25 minutes then hung up on. Called again, on hold for 20 this time before hung up on. Then another 10 minutes and you betcha...hung up on. Finally called and got someone after waiting 13 minutes. She told me she could do nothing to keep me in the services I had (nice customer retention there) and told me I would be paying nearly $20 more than the service I just canceled to get the "screaming deal" the first sales rep sold me on.  Take ownership for your reps mistakes here cox and get your act together. Not that it will do anything but after wasting 4 hours on this crap plus the nearly 2 hours it took for the installer to install my local channels, I'm spent and I'm pissed and I'm logging a complaint with the corporation commission. And teach your reps how to retain your clients better. While we DO have limited choices in the valley, be aware that we do have choices. Push enough people away and one day you'll be scrambling.

I've loved this place for years. Amazing food, even better service. They're very attentive to their customers-if it's a longer than usual wait will give me a drink or some garlic knots.  My grandparents were born and raised in new York and my grandpa can walk in here and feel like he's back home with the awesome food and conversation with the owner. And the owner is always working. Is great to see a business owner not just sitting on their back sides!

Came here around 10AM post 5k on a Saturday. It was pretty empty for a weekend. We were sat immediately and our server was quick with drinks.   I'll get to it quick- I just didn't love my food. I wanted to sooo badly. I got the huevos rancheros because I typically love it at other places. It was basically a very over flavored quesadilla filled with mashed black beans and a lot of pepper jack cheese. It had a small spoonful of salsa on top and 2 fried eggs. Personally I think there was too much going on and it was too heavy. The salsa made the tortilla soggy too. I only made it through half and didn't keep the leftovers. I am a leftovers gal so that should tell you a lot!   I might give it another shot someday but for now...no thanks.

My favorite salon hands down (no pun intended!) it is clean, modern, the staff is friendly and fast and thorough. I got a fill this weekend and he was incredibly thorough and even took care of my cuticles for me. Love a place that goes above and beyond like that.  A little bit ago I was there close to closing and packing up to leave when a girl walked in 2 minutes before they closed asking for a gel manicure. She was indecisive about the color and was taking forever. I was getting annoyed for them but they were totally professional and stayed long after closing to make sure she was happy. Such good customer service!

I've been coming here for over a year and drive all the way out here every 3 weeks for a fill and have for almost 6 months now. Lately the service has been rushed, the owner has been incredibly rude and I've had it. I'm taking my money and business somewhere else. Last time she was so annoyed she was complaining out loud to me, smudged my nail and didn't bother to fix it and the quality was just, overall, subpar. Nail salons are a dime a dozen, perhaps you should check your attitude and treatment of loyal customers.

I'm hooked. The chicken is tender, the crinkle fries are amazing and the sauce is the best part. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area and looking for some food.

Amazing salads! Some of the specials they run can be a bit pricy if you add meat but they are worth it. I would love if they opened earlier, around 6, for breakfast. I would stop by every day on my way to work!
