Favorite happyhourundergroundeverything bar. Service is always prompt, friendly, amazing. I'm in love with the Chipotle Ribs, they have fresh squeezed juice and have an awesome bar selection. The fireplace is nice, so are the super comfy bar stools:)  Update: no more chipotle ribs:( But i'm really excited to try out their brunch menu!

I visited not too long ago. For awhile it's been declining. However this time was the worst and I will not ever be returning, and neither will anyone with me. This is in regards to their kitchen, hopefully the health department is aware of this as well. My boyfriend and I went to the Rokerij on A Sunday we opted for the downstairs bar seating as i've always liked the ambiance and it best! :) We walked down and it was empty, we asked if we could sit in a booth and we were told they were all reserved and we could sit at the bar.  We didn't mind and just sat at the bar, I never mind sitting there.  We just wanted a little more privacy for his birthday but no biggie.  We were given menus, we ordered the Artichoke Dip appetizer and both ordered the Porkchop-both sounding delicious.  The appetizer came out fairly quick and was however soupy and possibly one of the worst i've had.  Our entrees were the concerning issue, however.  After waiting 20 minutes after our appetizer was done, our entree came out.  We both were hungry and dug in, to find both pork chops raw as all heck.  We waved down the bartender and told him, he told us to put them on separate plates, then just took our plates back.  He explained to us that he asked them to cook them medium rare because they come out dry a lot if you don't.  First of all, I appreciate trying to think ahead, but maybe don't serve something that comes out bad all the time?  I don't appreciate that the kitchen would send out ANY sort of poultry not cooked, raw, especially when it wasn't requested in the first place.  This is disgusting.  We never even received an apology, smile, nothing.  They came back out 10 minutes later, the same plates, and the bartender asked us to cut in and make sure they were cooked.  Why is that our job? The bartender also ignored the birthday situation, which I didn't exactly push but made known, just kind of lame.  Too add, only one couple came in during the hour and a half we were there, and were given explanations to the specials and menu in detail, while we were apparently a bother.  I get reservations, but... All in all, possibly the worst dining experience i've had in a while, and definitely won't return to any and I don't recommend Perry the bartender and his rude attitude.  To add, I emailed to let the owners know and received NO reply. Horrible customer service.

I literally just came upon this coffee shop thanks to Yelp!, and thank goodness.  I've been searching for an amazing cup of coffee and I found it.  I'm pretty sure the owner was the amazingly helpful and nice lady working behind the counter, (I saw her picture in an article posted on the wall). She was great.  My coffee was amazing, nicely priced, and extremely fast.  I will be returning and spreading the word!

First off, i've never met a person, let alone hostess, so depressing, rude, and not helping.  We politely said hello and asked for a booth, she looked at us like we were from Mars, and didn't say a word.  Whispered something to another girl, who sat us, without a word.  The only reason this restaurant is getting 1 star, is because of the delicious cheesecake dessert and cup of coffee, awesome! Also, the ambiance is fantastic, fabulous idea with the cloud ceiling.  Our server, Brittany, was rude, impatient, short, and the least bit helpful.  The only reason I know her name is because I heard her greet another table next to ours.  She didn't check on us more than once, the very polite busser lady took better care of us!    The food was NOT traditional, completely chainy, heavy, and full of oil.  I guess i'm just spoiled with good Mexican food from where I live...  The salsa tasted, (and looked), like tomato paste.  The chips were light and delicious though.    Basically, there is a reason the other Abuelo's have closed.

Big juicy burgers cooked to perfectoin with Sangria, bomb beer battered fries, and even their chili is delicious. Their chicken sandwich is hot and juicy served on an amazing bun. I really think buns matter on an awesome american meal. I've been here many times and service is always fast and friendly. I love the ambiance and coziness of the whole establishment. You will always see a regular at the bar with a beer and a sports game on.

I once experienced this lovely little Italian place on the corner-and I return again, and again. The service here is always excellent.  The music, ambiance, and big booths are fantastic.  Everything here always tastes fresh and perfect! My favorite is the chicken picatta, is yum-yum delicious! (Clam buckets for appetizers are also a giant plus!)

WOW, I feel explaining my experience here would not even come close to how I truly felt, words cannot express. The service was TERRIBLE.  I can start with the witchy "know-it-all" bartender being completely rude, not helpful, and pours one awful drink.  If you order a mixed drink, don't expect any alcohol in it.  The bartender informed me they serve 3 1/2 counts per drink, and if you're a bartender like I am-you know thats not even a shot of liquor. Second, the bald manager who made inappropriate comments, and even shut the fire off on us when about 4 of us were sitting around it!  Then proceeded to cackle laughing as he was walking away to sit with two employees who probably had gotten off of work.  I also watched him down two cocktails, and smoke cigarettes while going inside and out of the patio.  That is some extreme inappropriate, dissatisfying management. I will never return to this place again, I now know why I avoided it for so long. There are WAY better sports bars within a 1/2 mile radius of there with better food, service, and ambiance. Even the diviest of dive bars are better than this crap.

I love Hob Nobs! I've been downtown for about a year now and go there often, there sandwiches and salads are delicious...  I love vito's favorite, mmmm! They have life music, art from local artists for sale... Everyone there is always very friendly, free wi-fi, a nice cozy setting. Camel macchiatos are yummy as hell, go get one! I'm pretty sure they even have pizza! (Not that I would recommend combining the two!)

Really cozy and tucked away, I enjoy that about some of the downtown gems. We had the cheese curds, chicken and waffles with string green beans and the steak. They were all really unique and delicious. The waffle ended up being one of my favorite parts of the meal:) also their homemade ginger ale was delicious. Our server was very nice and offered great suggestions. Good pick overall:)

Zero stars, one of their employees STOLE my iPad right from my car.  I promptly told Manager about the situation, he told me to call the police all I wanted and that nothing would come from it other than a police report.  DO NOT TRUST OR WASH HERE.

Place was great. I loved the ambiance, warm and inviting with enough room for privacy. The food was really goodand served quickly, although I do wish everything was a bit warmer when served... prices are average of the Waterfront,as well as the portions, and our server (Johnny I believe...) made great suggestions and was extremely friendly. Try the Turkey Pastrami on a pretzel bun, pretty delicious. Ill be back:)

I feel like Jobots is somewhere you should really try out if you haven't. You will go back and leave satisfied:) The service can be a little slow, but be patient, they are hand crafting these masterpieces! They also always have something delicious you can munch on while posting up there as well:)

Every employee seems as if they do not care about their job. They move slow and blatantly don't care. I'm sure that's reflective of whose in charge. Also should probably have them ALL wear gloves when dealing with food. I'll definitely make that known. Gross. Twenty five minutes in line to get home to a burrito that was not closed and probably with germs. Trash we go.

I also had high hopes for this establishment.  I didn't even get to taste the food, because I was so irritated by the service.  Or rather should I say, I was bothering the bartender by sitting at her bar, patiently waiting for 10 minutes.  I wasn't even asked if I needed a menu, or a drink, nothing.  However, the menu looks delicious, inside is gorgeous, and with the right people making that place exciting, it could be another packed place on Central.   This place has great potential and I was really excited to try it out and spread the word.  :/ Good luck Sochu.

I probably stop in here 4-6 times a week for the past year. This is my favorite, go to location. I love all the staff, my service is always amazing and fast and my drinks rock. I love their promotions/fun merchandise/atmosphere. Go Dutch Bros!

Id give you three stars, but I tried you guys again this week and the same things happen. The food quality here for a good sub is fantastic. However, the staff can never seem to get an order correct. There is always something I didn't ask for, or specifically asked to not be on my sub. I've also waited over 15-20 minutes on a slow day for a hot sandwich. I even tried ordering online once and it told me it would take over 90 minutes so I called and cancelled. I really want this place to get better, because we need an amazing sub shop!!!  Their selection of teas rocks and the bagel place is delicious next door for early birds :)

Go Joes go! Everything was delicious. I had the pork chops and eggs with potatoes and biscuits and gravy. I love loved the potatoes and the biscuits were amazing and fresh even without the gravy. Oh and the coffee rocks and everyone is super friendly. Great diner. I will be back and bringing friends!

Used to be my favorite. No longer. 7:30 on a Sunday with one guy in the diner. We are yelled from the back to sit by two girls and served iced cold potatoes, sausage, hash, and eggs. Ew gross. No thanks. We won't be back. When Joe is there everything is always awesome!
