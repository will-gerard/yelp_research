I feel like this restaurant is everything Olive Garden wishes it were and pretends to be.  This is a fantastic place to go whether your a few friends looking for a good pizza (like seriously, the best thin-crust pizza in Phoenix) and beers in an un-pretentious atmosphere (Phoenix has a lot of pretentious places; this place is delightfully comfortable), or a family looking for a good pizza and beers in an un-pretentious atmosphere.  The patio is great - it's huge - but the interior is comfortable and has a large floor plan with lots of nooks for cozy dining.  I can't think of a better compliment to give this place than saying if I had friends in town, I'd take them to Oregano's before I took them to the yuppie places downtown, and I say that being very self-aware in my yuppie-ness. The pizza's classic and plenty tasty, the atmosphere is more comfortable, and best of all you feel like you're in Phoenix and not a hipster/tourist trap.

This place made me cheat on my other favorite Indian place in Phoenix. Actually, I left my other favorite Indian place in Phoenix. Their Paneer Tikka Masala is that seductive.  This place is great to go for the buffet, but don't let that distract you from their amazing entrees on the menu. They might seem a bit heavy on price, but they're easily large enough to split with another person, or split into two meals. They have so many for all meats and tons of vegetarian options. This place also has great garlic naan, but don't let that distract you from their amazing regular naan.   I also want to point out that the service here is really good. The staff are so friendly, especially if they start seeing you regularly, and you can just really tell that they love their business. If you or a friend loves Indian food, I would make yourself a friend of Flavors of India.  Also, they're a coke place!

It's expensive, and there's quite a long wait, but it's great food when all is said and done. Definitely a once-in-a-while spot, but also a worth-it spot. Some people would say it's a must-try, but if you're not in to wood-fired pizza, it will have little for you.  They do what they do, and they do it well. Both things to keep in mind if you're thinking of hitting the place up :)

I love going here. I really, really do, just to have that said off the bat. But there are some important things to understand about Lux.  1) Seating is always limited. Not even on a Tuesday night in July will this place be quiet and empty. Own that fact, love it, and keep looking.  2) The cocktails are phenomenal. There's no list of specialty cocktails. They go by requests for what you like, and make something that percolates in their brains all quick like. They also use beautiful glassware, which is really nice when you think about how rare that is.  3) It's actually kind of unfortunate that the cocktails eclipse the food. Lux is probably some of the best food you can get at its price point. If you think $19 for a steak is too much, just order it and keep in mind you'd pay $25 for cooking on that order at any other establishment. The same goes for literally everything else their fabulous cooks prepare. You can't go wrong with the soup, and I assure you the mac & cheese is a full meal.  4) They actually have newspapers! Real ones that you hold with your hands for the patrons to enjoy and leave behind! That basically makes Lux one of the most active town halls in the city of Phoenix.  5) They play full albums of good music, and not just rando indie bands people brag about having heard of. This is a place that appreciates Beyonce as much as all those weird bands whose names you can't remember.  There are a lot of things I don't understand about Lux. I don't get why people take selfies with their lattes. I don't understand why they have a DJ, but I'm glad he has a regular gig. I don't understand  why there are non-functional typewriters strewn about the place. But you know what? I keep coming back. We all keep coming back.

The pizza's are inventive and really really tasty. I personally think it makes Pizzeria Bianco look overrated.  The location isn't in the historic district, but there's a larger patio, and the inside of the building is simply more comfortable in my opinion. I personally really like this spot in Phoenix. I can also personally recommend it as a great double- or triple-date spot!  Family friendly, yuppie friendly, hipster friendly, all with good wine and good food. Walking distance from downtown venues and clubs, it's a great way to kick your night off with good taste and class. If you're a pizza fan, and you're in Phoenix, this would be the place I'd call a "don't miss."

I consider it a personal failing that I haven't reviewed this place yet. The staff is wonderfully friendly, the coffee is great, the loose leaf teas are very well curated to offer a nice variety of caf and decaf options without being overwhelming, and their iced tea selection has a black, herbal and fruited option. Their food menu is the perfect mix of limited and diverse (though I would not say this is a place to go for food), and they have a wide variety of baked goods that they rotate on a regular basis.  On top of that? They have handmade craft-y things if you want to impulse buy a gift and a rotating display of artwork on the walls. They do it all, and they don't mess it up.  This place. Everything about this place. My only concern is that it will one day get too crowded for its cozy floor plan!!  P.S. The bathrooms are always clean. Not regular restaurant clean, but the type of clean that's worth mentioning in a review of the place. And the sink fixture is really pretty!

This place is just the cutest. They have a great selection of rotating beers (just as large as Angel's Trumpet, actually!), and the food and service are great. The menu has great variety, whether you're a carnivore, a vegetarian, or looking for lighter fare. And yes, they do have french fries.  The greatest thing about this place, though, is how they make it a playground for the community. It's a climbers' bar, so the decor speaks to that, but they also have ample bike parking and regular community events. Also, trivia. So much trivia. On Wednesdays and Saturdays!   Long story short, it's basically the Cheers of Tempe. I wouldn't bring out-of-towners in to admire its glory, but I'd freak out of someone from the area told me they'd never been there. As a downtown-Phoenix loyalist, I still make my way to TempeTown about once a month to enjoy this space with good company. Cheers!

Great cocktails, but the atmosphere is very condescending and unpleasant. I brought a group of about 10 people for a happy hour, and as people trickled in, we were repeatedly asked if we had a larger group coming. When the full party had arrived, we were asked to sit in the back patio, i.e. smoking section (which was not a nice thing to do to my non-smoking friends), where there was no seating for groups larger than 5. I want to be clear: none of us had had anything to drink before our arrival. We were not belligerent, we were not rude. We were just treated that way.  We were also given conflicting messages about substituting different varieties of rum in the cocktails and were charged absurdly for the privilege of doing so... until we were told it was impossible because we would single-handedly ruin the owner's entire brand.  All in all, it's a good place to go for a cocktail. They're tasty, but it was easier and more pleasant to do business elsewhere. I haven't gone back, and I have no intention of doing so.

This place is a big part of why I fell head over heels for Phoenix.   The store carries the work of over 125 Arizona artisans that create everything from hand-painted ceramic bowls to small tables to turquoise pens. There are also hats, soaps, jewelry and cards. Everything is so unique and it gives you an appreciation for the artistic culture of the state. The prices vary from the "spontaneous gift" point to the "investing in my personal collection."  Beyond the "practical" art, there is a wall show of fine art that rotates every month and regular community events are hosted in the shop.   Simply put, it's easy to become a friend of Practical Art.

I love this place. It's one of my favorite spots in Phoenix for local theater. You can see everything from humorous original creations to recreations of Russian dramas or musicals about the Simpsons :)   If you're moseying around downtown and looking for something to do, you can always swing by Space 55 for some performances or storytelling and then hit up Lost Leaf for beers. Perfect Saturday evening!

Note: I've only been here once, but I'll update my review if/as I go more and further inform my opinion.  This place was perfectly enjoyable. The food and juice selections are on point and just what you would expect from an establishment branded as "True Food Kitchen." A cautionary note to the juices would be that if you're ordering one that incorporates lemonade, you might ask them to go light on it if you want to avoid a lot of sugar. But I want to focus on what makes this place exceptional.  The floorplan of the restaurant is really lovely and engaging. You come in and you can see the cooks prepping for a lot of the dishes you read about on the menu. I've never seen anything like this before, and I really loved it. Secondly, this place is probably one of the best places to split a meal. I don't recall if there was a split plate charge, but it would be worth it regardless. My co-worker and I decided to split the Quinoa Burger and a salad, and we received separately plated mini-burgers with our portion of the sides, and our salad portions were served to us in our own bowls. Maybe I'm eating at the wrong places, but I felt like that was truly exceptional service. Lastly, the menu was really varied and had lots of options for vegetarian and gluten free fare.   tl;dr This restaurant trafficked in pretty standard "heatlhy" fare and did a fine job. What sets it apart is the experience provided by the friendly, knowledgeable staff and the overall setting, which is greatly enhanced by the integration of prep space into the floor plan of the dining area.  UPDATE: There is no split plate fee at True Food, as verified by the owner in the below comment. Further awesome, verified.

Prices are reasonable, the wine is great, and the servers always have an on-point recommendation. They also have a great deal on Tuesdays called Board and Bottle night. It's tough to get a table, but that does more to confirm my high rating of the place than conflict with it.  It's a great place for a happy hour or a friendly brunch, or whatever. It's just a good place to spend time :)

This gym is right next to where I work, and the price is right for the robust services, class schedule and equipment. That said, I wouldn't call coming here an enjoyable experience.   It seems like there's always something wrong in the bathrooms (broken locks, poorly cleaned, etc.), and the folks that walk the floor and sell personal training are kind of aggressive. Turn on, tune in, work out, and you'll be fine.  UPDATE: It would be unfair of me not to include this. As of late, the bathrooms have been more regularly/thoroughly cleaned, it seems.

Yes, this place. Just yes.  This place is awesome, and I don't even like rum. Their fries, beans, and food are all delicious, original and very reasonably priced.  I like to go places and cobble meals out of appetizers, which you can definitely do at this place, but the entrees are also very yum. Just eat everything.  The layout is nice and spacious, and they have a lovely patio. I used to frequent this spot when I worked in the area, and now I go because I just plain like the place. Catch a show across the street at the Torch!

I love coming here for an inexpensive night out. This little theater is Phoenix's "home for long-form improv." You get to have some great laughs, meet funny people, and cap it all off with a few cheap well drinks at H.B. Handratty's.   A lot of people take classes here and then form a group with their classmates or friends, so the Torch has a great diversity of acts of local talent making up 20-30 minutes of comedy on the spot based on your suggestions. Beware, though, you might just walk into a show where you're expected to participate!

I split a cab ride with a gentleman on my way home from the airport, but rather than have us split the cost, the cab driver charged both of us for the full fare from the airport to our homes. The total for about 15 miles of driving came to about $70.  More importantly, the driver did not seem to know the city of Phoenix very well at all (despite its simple grid system). He drove from downtown to the interstate rather than driving me through the more direct route on surface streets. Once we were on the interstate, he attempted to get off at every exit, and I had to tell him on each occasion that I lived further north. Once off the interstate, he attempted to drive me back towards downtown. Once parking in my apartment's lot, he drove around excessively, adding an additional $1.50 to the fare, even though I asked him to stop and let me out.   I don't know if the circuitous route was the result of ill intention or ignorance, but I ended up paying $40 for a 5 mile drive. When I attempted to call Mayflower's office to see about having my fare retroactively adjusted, no one answered their phones. I'm still waiting to speak with someone.

How on EARTH have I not reviewed this place!? Why? I'll tell you why. Because I stopped approaching this place with any airs of evaluation long long before I started consistently writing reviews on Yelp.  This place has the perfect food. It's delicious, unpretentious and super cheap. You can tell it's made by people that never went on a quest to make the world's most delicious tacos - it just happened because of the magic of family recipes. Like, it's street food, so if that's not your thing don't go. But, if what you want is to experience some delicious tacos and a slice of City life that is as endearing as it is confusing, go here and hang out any time between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. If you go here and walk away unhappy, that's your problem.  Only heads up is that their hours are kind of wonky because they serve the late night crowd.

I love this place. My go-to is the paneer tikka masala, which is more aromatic and tomato-y than the sweet stuff you get from frozen dinners or at Indian places. Also, I love eating vegetarian as much as possible. When I'm craving the good stuff and am willing to sacrifice innocent animals for the purpose, I go for the goat biryani. Guessing by how frequently the place is packed with people, these dishes are perfectly representative. I also recommend the hummus appetizer if you're looking for some tasty to go with your numnum.  The big warning to take in if you go to this place is that if you aren't a leftovers person or won't be able to pack leftovers, you should really plan on sharing a meal. I tend to go here and eat until it hurts and still have enough for lunch the next day. I like to go and split an appetizer and plate with a friend, and I always leave more than full.  Last note, the service here is wonderful. The owners run the shop themselves and are very friendly and appreciative of your business. They get busy, so it might take a moment or a friendly ask, but the staff is so responsive. If you love experiencing the world's cuisines and have some time in Phoenix, I would highly recommend Khyber Halal.

I came in for late night cocktails and was blown away by the quality and the professionalism of the staff. The cocktails are very well-conceived and nothing you could expect to find anywhere else, and even their takes on classics go above and beyond. They have a wide selection of high-quality spirits, and the bartenders are very competent and willing to meet you where you're at. If you want to stick with a classic you know and love, they'll hit it out of the park. If you want to try something for the first time and just have them make something up, they'll hit it out of the park.  The only cautionary notes I would throw out is that the place is not a bargain, and it's a bit... fancy. I rode my bike in and felt pretty out of place in tennis shoes and jeans. (An important note, though, the bartenders were still more than friendly and professional.)  tl;dr Come here to experience fine cocktails in a classy setting made by friendly, savvy bartenders. And if you're gonna be fancy, get fancy.  Also! If you're a Bourbon Fan, they have a specialty cocktail that incorporates the smoke of pipe tobacco. My friends and I are still talking about it a week later!

This place is such a wonderful little hangout. It's hard to get people to argue against an evening at Angel's, and for great reason. The beer selection will have something for everyone, and the food is pretty darn good. You can drop in for a beer as part of a stroll in the neighborhood, or you can snag a table and post up for several hours. The place can get crowded, but it's not they're fault they're doing the things right.   The staff are great with recommending beers on the 31-draft rotating menu based on what you like, and the prices and ABV are right on the menu as well, so it's hard to be unpleasantly surprised, even if you're not the adventuresome type.  My only critique of this place is that if you prefer spirits or an alcohol-free evening, Angel's has very little to offer. Without the fun of exploring the beer selection, the food goes from "pretty darn tasty" to "I'd rather have gone somewhere else."

Some people compare this place to Chipotle, and they need to stop. As someone who loves Chipotle even more than the proper amount, Gadzooks blows them out of the water.  All of the potential fillings for your enchiladas are flavorful. Like, not that silly chef's kind of flavorful that involves words like "light" and "delicate." These are some serious enchiladas with some serious, robust flavors. The spicy cornbread for example? It's actually spicy, and corny, and sweet. Also, you can get your enchiladas in chiles after 4:00 p.m. or some kind of delicious insanity. You can also add eggs, and they have a huge variety of sauces and toppings.   Just go here. I don't care if you're a local, native, hipster or old foagie. Ignorance is not bliss. Enchiladas is bliss.

I can't believe it's taken me this long to review this place!  Bragg's has literally all the things I look for/love in a restaurant, so for me it's one of the best spots in Phoenix. This pie factory-cum-diner now boasts an all-vegan menu laden with hearty comfort foods. Vegan comfort foods, you ask? How can this be, you ask?  You're covered here whether you like sweet or savory noms. They've got banana pancakes with walnuts, nachos, egg-like things that are very egg like, and sandwiches that stand proud and say "I am not meat. I am delicious." The great thing is they're not "good vegan food." It's just good food that happens to be vegan.  My personal favorite is the Nopales Like Home because of my favorite thing they make at Braggs: jackfruit barbacoa. Jackfruit is the fruit of a plant that when cooked under low heat with marinade soaks up its flavor and can be shredded, taking on a very pork-y texture. I get this every time, and every once in a while I'll see one of the massive salads and get a little jealous, which is how I know it's time for an extra side of jackfruit.  A favorite-non-food thing about this place for me is the diverse collection of mugs and the way-more-diverse and impressive collection of salt and pepper shakers.   tl;dr There's coffee. There's pie. There's delicious comfort food. It's a cozy establishment with great food and lots of personality.

So much yes to this place! I love it here. It's not the best place if you're looking for a whole bunch of variety, but everything they do they execute so perfectly. From coffee to cocktails to delicious num nums, this place has it all at a price point you really can't argue with. It's a great place to go for dinner, a low-key reading session, or for a quick iced tea after perusing the Saturday Farmer's Market. My only wish is that they had more vegetarian options, but I'm sure that's on the horizon.  I recommend the veggie rice bowl. Offer to be upcharged for extra veggies. You won't regret it! The black bean soup is also delicious. The Flarney Garney is a serious commitment to napping later.

I like this place a lot, but I don't feel there's a great deal to say. Just that it's a really, really good place for brunch. It's fancy food in a casual setting, so you get the best of both worlds!  The food is great and there is a wide variety of inventive eggs benedict and pancakes to choose from, so you're all set whether you like sweet or savory for your morning meal. The coffee is good, and the servers are nice. Sometimes service is slow when they're really busy, but anyone who genuinely complains about that is a terd.  This place is also exceptionally vegetarian friendly, which I find is a tendency among breakfast joints, but it's still worth noting.   I've never had the cocktails here, so I can't speak to them, but I'm sure they're also delicious.  tl;dr You'll drop a pretty penny for breakfast/brunch/lunch at Snooze, but it's familiar food that's done well, and so it's well worth it. If you have friends visiting that appreciate good food but want to stick to something they know and keep it casual, Snooze is one of your best bets in the Valley.

I've been here enough times to say that this is a perfectly fine place to hang out. The service is great, the restaurant is actually very nicely designed, from what I've heard the cocktails are pretty delicious, and refills on chips are free.   That said, I have never enjoyed the food. I've had a chimichanga, tamales, and a couple of different side items, all of which I felt either lacked flavor or were more money than they were worth. The cheese and chorizo side is good if you don't mind spending $9 on queso dip, but the beans, tamales, and burritos I've had have inspired a resounding "meh" in me.  Taking on the moniker of a taco house was an ambitious move in a city like Phoenix. If they called themselves "Mod Living Room with Patio, Cocktails and Chips," I would find the branding more honest.

This place is a sneaky little asset to the 7th and Missouri neighborhood. With a wide selection of wine, sake and bombers right across from the BYOB sushi place, the French Grocery is a must-visit. Pick up a bottle or two to take back to your place, or do it genuine French style and set up at a table in the grocery's lobby for a bit.   The recommendations from the on-site sommelier will help you a great deal in navigating the wine selection by your tastes and price point. Enjoy!

Pozole pozole pozole pozole. Pozole pozole pozole. POZOLE!  I say that as a person who loves to eat vegetarian, but the pozole is messed up it's so good. I'll be honest, I've not explored much beyond the pozole on the menu because economically it's hard to justify. This massive bowl of pozole is such a cost-effective deal, full of broth, pork, veggies and goodness, it seems like a waste of money to spend even the same amount on a sandwich, let alone more. I'm sure they're fine, but you get my point.  The fries are okay. Just okay.   A foodie's tour of Phoenix wouldn't be complete without a bowl of the pozole, and neither would an architect's. The Vig Fillmore is housed in a historic building in downtown Phoenix with a massive patio that actually economizes on its space with room for both seating and play. Speaking of play, there are trivial pursuit cards at all the tables, which can be nice on a busy morning when the service staff is taking a while (This is not a complaint. The place just get's busy because, you know, it's got good food.)  The wine menu here is VERY good, with a selection that rivals some of Phoenix's actual wine bars while also trafficking in better food and lower prices. Their specialty cocktails are also inventive and tasty and the beer selection robust.  tl;dr This place doesn't advertise itself as the place to be, but it really kind of is. It's got a great vibe for hanging out and plenty of reasons to stay a while.

This place has classic tacos from Mexico D.F. and a really great salsa bar. The peanut salsa is unexpectedly spicy, and the cilantro salsa is a personal favorite of mine.   I'm a fairly unadventurous eater. Once I find my favorite, I like to stick to it, but that's pretty much impossible here. I want to try everything, and think that over time, I'll eventually get there. Until then, my top recommendations are the street plate with at least 1 mole taco. You'll be upcharged, but if that's your only reason for not trying this piece of delicious, message me for a stronger sales pitch. The point of this place is that if you know what you like, or even if you don't, you'll find something here. Everything tastes like a really good version of what you'd expect at a price point that can't be beat.  Pro tip: toss some cilantro salsa in with your rice :)

The only thing better than a great bookstore is a great local bookstore with superb curation of its content. Changing Hands is full of classics, bestsellers and hidden treasures like an illustrated guide to yoga sequencing and a scratch n' sniff guide to wine! I love going here with friends to see what they pick out.  The prices are what you'd expect of any book store, and they have a really good exchange program. Changing Hands has a lot of community events in its common area like book club meetings, signings, and I think even a knitting group! When those aren't happening, the common area is open for people to read, write, study or quietly socialize. Right in the common area is First Draft, a small bar that serves wine, beer, cocktails and has a limited selection of appetizers and baked goods. Service is always kind and quick.  This is the second Changing Hands in the Phoenix metro area, and while the footprint of the bookstore is smaller than the Tempe location, the common area and First Draft more than make up for it!

Love love love this place. The food is so hearty and delicious, and for how kitchy the restaurant is, you would expect it to be more expensive. It's a bit more expensive than fast food, don't get me wrong, but the quality is so good, you really are getting a great deal.   I need to put a quick qualifier on this and say that this stops being true pretty quickly if you are committed to meat with every meal. Adding "protein" is a pricy proposition here, but it's also 100% not necessary. You'll be full with chicken or without, so I would say skip it. This place does vegetarian fare really well, so enjoy it!  The restaurant layout is perfect for a casual lunch with friends, and a wide variety of tea and lemonades to have as a beverage. I really do love this place.

It's cheap, it's delicious, and it's delicious. Also, it's delicious. I can't really elaborate beyond these points, but if you're a Phoenix native, you must go here for tacos. Simply must.  Also, try the memelitas! :D

This spot is a great addition to the downtown Phoenix food-o-sphere. Particular points of pride are their combined selection of in-house and craft beers. The servers are really quick AND friendly, and the restaurant's artwork is a rotating selection of pieces for pleasure and sale. (When I was there, they had these cool little animated-looking critters.)  Now that we've covered the general positives, it's time to discuss something important. The Veggie Hot Pot. This is the best vegetarian pub food I have ever had, and frankly, it trumps a lot of vegetarian dishes you'll find at established veggie eateries like True Food and Green. I don't mean that as a slam to those places, but this dish is just something special if you're a little bit over turning down "protein" in your salad, getting the mac and cheese or hoping for a vegetarian soup to go with your squash sandwich. No no.  For starters, the Veggie Hot Pot is hearty. It's warm. It's filling. It's flavorful. It combines nutrient-dense, seasonal foods into a chunky tomato-based sauce and gives you some polenta for dipping. Fiber. Vitamins. Carbs. It's a simple meal, don't get me wrong, but it's the ideal of a plant-based meal. It's a plant-based meal you can drink on. A rare find and a choice feature of the menu at Mother Bunch. Kudos!

This place follows all of the rules of how to find exceptional ethnic food. You'll find this sneaky little spot in an unassuming building with very little signage. Inside, you'll find the floorplan modestly but tastefully decorated and packed with Benghali, Pakistani and Afghani Phonecians.  The buffet is amazing. The vegetarian dishes have more robust flavors than I typically encounter, even within East Indian and Middle Eastern cuisines. The saag paneer is a total winner. I'm typically turned off by saag and palak paneer dishes because they're too soupy and creamy, but here it's completely different. The same goes for the chana masala.   If you're a meat eater, you won't be disappointed. They have chicken tikka as well as a great selection of goat, chicken and beef simmered in characteristic sauces.   The price for the dinner buffet is also exceptionally reasonable. While it seems only regular-reasonable at first blush, your drink and naan are included.  I wrote this review, and now I want to go to there...

I thought this place was great! They have a good selection of tacos for both vegetarians and meat-eaters, and the michelada is actually tasty. I've been to some hipster Mexican restaurants that mess that drink up royally, and this is not one of them.   Price wise, I would say this place is damn fair for the quality of the food. You might consider it spendy relative to some places, but the guac is also made tableside and the food is really really good, so it gets to be a little spendy.  The one thing that's kind of a bummer is that, being nestled into a side spot at The Yard, it's got a small floorplan relative to the demand for their tacos, especially on Tuesday. But if your least favorite thing about a place is that so many people like it you have to wait a bit for a seat, you're doing alright.  tl;dr Come for the Miches, stay for the tacos.

I love this place! You come in and nab your little plates and nom your little sushi noms! You can rack up a big tab pretty fast, so don't let the low price per-plate trick you into building up a tower that crushes your weekend budget, but I love love LOVE the pay-as-you-go approach.  My favorites are the seaweed salad, the salmon nigiri and the Philadelphia roll, which is pretty much what I would get at any sushi place. They have a few vegetarian rolls, but I can't say I would recommend this for vegetarians, and definitely not vegans.   The staff here are also super friendly and a big part of why I keep coming back as well.  tl;dr This is a great place to go for happy hour + sushi or a fun dinner spot that won't break the bank. Vive la Sushi Station!

I love this place. Anyone who is a regular at Cartel, Lux or Copper Star should come here.   What I love about this place is that it's built around the idea that you're there to read or write, so the ambient noise is quiet and the music they play is never a distraction. The tables also give you plenty of space to work, whether you're alone or with a small group. Don't need a table? Leather armchair!   Definitely put this place into your Phoenix cafe rotation!

I really, really, really wanted to hate this place. I tried, too! But just shut up, okay? I know that arcade bars and jenga are a little overplayed right now, but people who genuinely complain just hate fun or suck at pinball or something.  Valley Bar is great. They've got a great diversity of drinks, so you can play on the cheap or class it up with a boozeable named after your favorite Arizona politician. (The McCain is made with Mezcal and a must-try for Scotch people.) My only complaint would be that the distribution of drinks doesn't always match the needs of the customer, which is my way of saying I have had to navigate a very choked floorplan with something only slightly sturdier than crystal stemware holding $9 worth of delicious.  NONE OF THIS MATTERS! Valley Bar could be a guy dolling PBR tallboys out of an igloo in the bed of his pickup truck in a much shittier alley, and I would still show up if the house band was there. Over and out.

Oh man. I heard skeptical reviews of this place because of loud music or something, but whatever. It's all love. This place is great.  I know I always talk about the vegetarian options, and this place does have plenty, but we have to HAVE TO talk about the brisket.   It's huge. It's tender. It comes swimming in yummy salt meat flavored juices. There is an egg on top. And in the middle of it all is PARMESAN GRITS! Parmesan. Grits. I couldn't finish it. I got to eat it twice. I'm so happy : ' )  The wine list is also really fun to look at, even if it's a bit overwhelming. There are little icons that denote different flavors. The only rough thing is that the most tannic wines seem to only be sold by the bottle (wails).  My friend got the massive pancake, and it was massive. Like, so massive. So were the salads, which I eyeballed from across the room because I'm a creep. Basically, I get the sense these folks don't mess things up. The place is nice to sit in, the food is great and reasonably priced. It's just all around good stuff happening here.

I like this place! It's small and cozy, and the beers are great. They might be a bit limited in the brews they have available on any given day, but that's the price  you pay for a small brewery, and it's really not a big one.  Try the Jomax with a shot of espresso. You won't regret it! (unless you don't like Porters... then don't do that)
