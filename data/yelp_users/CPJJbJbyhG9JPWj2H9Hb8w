A lot of old reviews might say this place isn't good but I enjoyed the customer service. I took my car in with my Groupon believing I needed the brakes changed. After inspecting them I was told that the brakes were fine. I'm happy that they were honest with me instead of lying. Check out the Groupon available now, it's a great value for all they will do for your vehicle.

As you can see a lot of reviews say this place isn't worth the time of day. However I received my food rather quickly. I do know the gentleman in front of me did wait quiet awhile though. The floors are dirty and got my shoes all sticky but at the same time it is a fast food restaurant (not saying a fast good place shouldn't be clean just saying it won't be spotless). It was awkward waiting for my car to get done here and having the 16 y/o cashier hitting on me when I'm not even giving her the time of day. I did end up getting free tacos though for waiting so long for my car haha so that's why they get 2 stars!

This restaurant is awesome, I'm so glad I have discovered Yelp so I can brag a bit about it for all they do. All of the food is great and made fresh, pita bread is nice and warm and the chicken salad is amazing! It's all family owned and operated and has been that way since forever, my aunt first found the place before our whole family started coming here and the lady to this day asks me how everyone is doing every time me and my wife walk in. Trust me this place is so good that it's what I brought my wife home for Valentine's day this year and she was happy I did. Always hits the spot and is way better for you then any fast good restaurant, now I need to check out the Desert Swirl in the same parking lot, I'll make sure to let everyone know my thoughts!

Someone let Sam Fox know what exactly he has with this gem right here! Over the last couple weeks I have planned a night out for my wife and I for celebrating our 6 month wedding anniversary and our first baby boy on the way in the end of October, and I must say I am extremely satisfied with Making Olive & Ivy part of the plan! My wife and I originally walked into the Marketplace side door but a worker there was happy to lead us to the hostess stand and then we were led to our table. We were greeted by our waiter Josh P. who congratulated us on our 6 Month and our son on the way. This impressed me and took me by surprise as the waiter who I have never spoken to in my life congratulated us right off the bat. He gave us time to look over the menu but never left us stranded. He filled our drinks without a hitch, never reaching over us or interrupting our conversation. Josh then brought out this amazing bread with this sauce they didn't look good off the bat but was out of this world! My wife ordered the lasagna and I ordered these awesome little pasta raviolis' filled with cheesy/creamy awesomeness. From appetizer to entree then from entree to dessert, Josh wiped down the table and made everything fresh and clean. Also during our stay one of the managers, Kim, stopped by and somehow beat Josh to the punch with filling up our drinks. I'm not sure how others feel but for me it's awesome to see a manager work on the floor and see the managment team working alongside the waiters. I wish I had pics of all of the good because it was awesome, I will make sure to return ASAP as the food, staff and environment is great, thanks Josh for helping us celebrate on a special night out! Hope to see you guys again soon and will make sure to sit where Josh will be our waiter!!!

This autozone is pretty rock solid. The staff is very knowledgeable although you may have to wait awhile in line to get anything. It's also very convenient that they are open 24/7. I'm not some crazy person who is there at 3am to get anything but when me and my buddy need something for my car at 8 or 9 it's nice to go to the autozone right down the street. Only getting 4 stars due to the wait time that you may have to go through. Be careful idk about anyone else but this is a place I can definitely blow the budget.

There's a reason this place has 4.5 stars. I am so glad Yelp let me find this place and am sure there are many places all around the Valley which I am also missing but have the hope of finding now that I use Yelp! This is the perfect little mom & pop burger and sub shop! The burgers are out of this world and my wife likes their subs. If you check in on Facebook or Yelp you get a 10% discount as well. So far of the 2 times I have gone I haven't spent more than $13 for me and my wife both! And I'm talking about stuff like a double cheeseburger and fries for me and a large sub for her, good stuff! Here is my first review of little places I found using Yelp, I'm sure there will be more!

Raising Canes is awesome! Just got back home from swinging by after the wife was craving it and of course I'll never pass down some good chicken haha. Ended up going back a mile and some change just so we could pick up a Carniac combo w/ the best Mug Rootbeer. The atmosphere is laid back and staff have never been rude in anyway, prices are pretty good too, definitely a place worthwhile!

What can I say? Mormons make damn good food! Cafe Zupas has a wide selection of Sandwiches and Soups (Haven't tried any Salads but I assume they would be great as well). I always go with the BBQ Pulled Pork and Lobster Bisque. Staff is always friendly and they seem to have a genuine care for how you are and the meal they prepare for you. One of my favorite parts is that they seem to be pro-gun as well (No anti-gun signs) and I have open carried in this establishment multiple times without incident. I can't wait until the next visit, thinking about it makes my mouth water!!!

Food was pretty good? Review is mostly based upon the customer service we received. After waiting forever me and my wife we're starving and couldn't wait to eat a nice meal for our little night out. However the waiter was as slow as a snail and didn't really listen to us, she brought out the wrong soup once (we both had the unlimited soup/salad for $9.99 still a good deal). And then when I told her I wanted the another bowl of what I originally had she brought out 2 assuming that my wife wanted the same soup as well when she did not and was stuffed. I really do think that the right waiter would have made this review much better but no matter how good the food may be great customer service must accompany it in my book or else it was all for nothing, will end up going back but hope to not get the same waiter.

I have been to this place once since their Grand Opening and definitely plan to return! I know they are under the same chain as Bosa Doughnuts but imo these are better! The glazed donuts give Krispy Kreme a run for their money and their wide assortment of other types beats any doughnut shop that I can think of. Overall a great place, customer service is good, 4 stars is the magic number on this one!
