Shout outs to my man Greg at the bar who has always taken care of me and my friends every single time we come in. The staff is great and Greg is on point all day everyday! Quick service and friendly! Tempe food is great but the staff makes this place one of a kind!

Gave this company a shot this week in hopes that my A/C would get fixed. And sure enough, it did.   But let me break down why I gave this company 5 staawws (stars). So I call and lovely Amber answered. Now I say lovely because she answered with such enthusiasm and a good introduction. She was pretty damn professional. If there was a sport for answering services, Amber would be on the top team and the leader of that shit. Good job Ambros! They were quick to schedule me in the next day and was able to get a confirmed window to expect a tech. On the day of my repair they even called to ask "is it OK for tech to come early?". Now in my head I'm like "fuck yeeuhh come early my damn balls is sweatin" but I can't say that cause I'm try a be a professional customer.  So my technician came and introduced himself as Enrique.  Now Enrique didn't come to my home all Pisces that he had to work, didn't have a bad attitude or any nonsense like that. He was positive, friendly, and certainly a happy person. Let him know my issue and this dude went to grind mode. He looked at my thermostat and went and fixed a blown fuse. Here is what really made the other 4 stars. Enrique not only showed me a problem, showed me how I can fix it, showed me how things worked and stuck around to make sure it was Alaska in my home. I don't care if this job was easy to him or hard, he came correct. I really insisted on giving him tip but he assured me that he was fine and that it was his job to even be doing what he was doing. I was impressed. I would recommend requesting this godlike technician!   I would break my own damn A/C just to have some 5 star service like this. Hell motha fuckin yeah!!!

Was here last night to get some Korean style sushi. Not very many places do this other than Mido sushi in Tempe (you gotta ask them, not in menu). Pretty much it's salmon and tuna sashimi, red bean paste (spicy), garlic and jalape√±os and baby lettuce wraps.   This place is like a whole in the wall joint. Not your typical Japanese feel, they play that bomb country music, which takes away from the ambience. The environment is pretty boring. I'm not sure but I think staring at the walls got my heart racing....that type of environment.   The food came and yeah..... I wasn't really impressed at all. The sushi didn't seem that fresh. The cuts were pretty small in my opinion and for sushi a small combination it took a while for the food to come. They might be a little bit short on staff or its family owned. Idk but wasn't feeling it.    "Bish don't kill my vibe" -Compton's best

Alright so don't let this place fool you. That cute lil Asian girl is a wax master. She trained the yoda of all wax masters. I don't know who taught her but it's on point. I didnt get mines done here but she did my sisters. And now my sister gets them digits left in right, cause her eye brow game hawwd son!!  I see them do some cool nails and eyelashes too. This place is like that secret spot you almost want to keep the location to yourself. Anyway they are nice people too.    Remember to ask yourself is it worth it? Let me work it. I put my thang down flip it 'n reverse it...

This vape shop knows what they are doing. Went in to get some juice because I am new and not sure what is good. They have bottles you can sample juices, this one dude name Dan was really helpful I was looking for Apple and after he found me a good apple it tasted as if I was in the grocery store. Like this dude was a produce manager back in the day namsayin! If you are looking for a master of flavors for juice, Dan has trained w the most elite flavor tasters in the highest altitude where all you can do is taste, so I trust his judgement. You can't go wrong with his recommendations.  "I got what people want, and they want what I got" -Dan
