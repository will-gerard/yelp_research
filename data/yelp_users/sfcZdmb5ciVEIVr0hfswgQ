This place is great! Friendly service and gorgeous, tasty baked goods. The green tea flan is amazing as are the sukiyaki beef sandwiches and curry pan. It's hidden but the price is great and this place is heaven for savory dessert lovers!

Get there around 11 and grab some bento boxes! They're great!

The egg sandwich was good, but macarons were ugly, service was poor, wait time was long and prices are high.
