So I have used a number of comanies, gone back and forth trying to find the best pest control that works. I hate scorpions and I don't want them in my house!. I have tried everything to doing it myself with stuff from the store, to all natural pest companies that make my house smell wonderful but wasn't great at getting the bugs. I have ended up coming back to titan everytime. So far so good. With their attic dusting, I have probably only had 1-2 (knock on wood) scorpions during the summers that's it!. The workers are hit an dmiss; some are great and some are not so friendly, however the prices are completly reasonable .

Never again, date night at Red Lobster. I should of listened to my family who has told me of the many times they have gotten food poisoning here. We were lucky, no food poisoning however the food was horrible. The only good thing about our night was we were taken right away, our server was nice, and our appetizer was taken off our bill. The food was undercooked, tasted like it was two days old, and we were missing parts of the meal (shrimp).  Drinks came at the end of the appetizer and we never got the extra plate we asked for...So far Red Lobster will not be on our list of restaurants to dine at.

I have lived in Anthem for the past 6 years and have never tried this place until now. I am so happy I finally did. Good food at reasonable prices. Also very clean.

We stay home a lot with our dogs, so I have not really used their boarding but maybe once. We have three dogs, one being a cocker spaniel who needless to say gets very hot here in the summer. We have used their mobile pet groomer for the past few years and have no complaints. He comes back looking very good and seems to be in a good mood. This summer we took him in the shop for the first time to be groomed and I was very happy with their willing to help. I had not gotten his shot records to them, but they made it real easy by having it faxed and I was able to get my dog in the next day with no problems. The only complaint that I can say is that their prices are high in my opinion, but I know you get what you pay for!

SO we have been in Anthem for awhile and have gone to this restaurant many times, even through all the numerous owners. So far we are not thrilled. The food is average and the service is slow. The bar is nice and there is seating outside which is great however not the best mexican food.

Birthday Parties, not again! My kids loved coming to the play fort to play, although over priced and small, it was the closest place to play indoors. I decided to have my son's 3rd birthday here. Not only were the doors closed when I came to set up, but no one answered their phone and they did not show up to open the doors until 5 minutes before my party started. My guests were walking in the door as I was still setting up. I never got an apology, rather a remark of "you still had time". I have talked to other parents who have said the same thing...ok place to play but birthdays, not so much!

I love this cleaning company! I have only used them for a few months but already am a fan of their friendly and caring staff, their attention to detail, and their professionalism. Cleaning reports, check-in's, and surprise inspections are things that separates this cleaning company from the rest. Thank you!

So we have lived in Anthem for awhile now and are so bored of the few restaurants that are here. We are so excited about Two Brothers, not only because the food is organic (so needed) but so far they have great service. We have now made this place part of our weekly dining. I would like to see the menu grow to provide more options.

My family are advid users of a number of dirt bikes and atv's. We are always looking for a great place to take our toys for maintenance or help. Rich at R-ATV is amazing. I felt comfortable going in there and we are so far incredibly happy with their service department. Clean store and friendly service. Definitely a keeper!
