This is my favorite place to eat, I come her once every pay period.(even if I'm extreme dieting its my cheat meal) the food is always so tasty and satisfying. They have healthier alternatives to all of there meals which is a nice perk. For about 2 years now I've always had the BBQ chicken meal. Recommend this to anyone trying to try something new!

Over all we enjoyed our stay. I would like to remind you not to spend $15 dollars on Starbucks drinks and bring them to the pool, they will make you throw them out. I understand drinks not being allowed in the pool area but this wasn't my only issue. I asked one of the servers in pool while she was taking my families order if I could get some water. I had been getting my own water all day and was filling up my cup at the water coolers, since I was in the pool and my family was order drinks I didn't think it was to much to ask but the sever responded "we have water coolers all over" so I guess to much to ask. Over the place was decent but that experience left a bad taste in my mouth.

The food was amazing, I was so happy with the Mac n Cheese 'the one and only steak'. When we walked in it seemed we only deserved the happy hour menu, we came to eat.. I work in customer service and am easy going everywhere I go. One of our meals we order was not what we initially ordered, totally okay, but instead of "not a problem let us fix that for you" we got a "did you eat a bite of it?" Followed by 10 min later of the chef saying "oh I thought you were going to eat it? I have an extra meal of what you initial ordered if you want it...?" (No I came here to spend top dollar on your food to get what I didn't order.) I said please and thank you every time to ease the tension I was feeling from the staff. Due to the service I will not be back, I'm sure that's exactly what the chef wanted, we must not fit the demographic of his "idea clientele." Food was phenomenal too bad the service wasn't what I expected.

The environment is great on a Saturday morning, people were laid back eating breakfast, conversing, some were on there laptop doing some school work.  On top of that my coffee was delightful I ordered a iced cafe mocha with coconut milk and no whip! Sooooooooooo satisfied for a morning on my way to work. Great place, great environment, great coffee!!!

This place is my favorite breakfast place! I love the bacon, coffee, pancakes but mostly the environment! Heather the hostess is the sweetest girl ever! I adore her! This place as a whole I always leave with 100 percent satisfaction in knowing I was well taken care of by my server and food is always tasty! Also guys would be crazy not to promote heather into any position she desires! Great job snooze on camelback you guys are amazing!!!

This place was great, I enjoyed the environment and music. Perfect place for a first date! The beer was phenomenal, I forgot the name of it but the cherry chocolate one was my favorite. The service staff was very nice and accommodating, I felt if we ever needed anything they were a step ahead. Love this place!
