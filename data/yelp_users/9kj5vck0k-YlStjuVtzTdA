I think this might be the worst experience we have ever had with a business.  We dropped off our 4 horse trailer with live in quarters at camping world for maintenance and to have the generator fixed.  After it being there for a week and a half and not hearing from them, we give them a call.  We get some big story about how they were waiting for our approval on repairs but after pushing more, we were told that the person handling it quit.  So after getting that handled and about another two weeks, we are told it is done.  After getting it home, we find out that we were charged over 3K and the trailer has more damage than when brought in.  The generator still doesn't work, the overhead recessed lighting is hanging , the blinds that were suppose to be restrung are just gone, the tv is missing and the list is just to long.  At this point, we are leaving in a few days for a two week barrel race excursion and can't take it back in.  We are told to bring it back in when we get back and it will all be taken care of.  We get back and bring it in immediately.  Well almost two weeks later and daily phone calls to them and we are finally told that basically they couldn't fix anything and to come get the trailer.  We are just bewildered that this place is still in business

I have worked in real estate since 1998 and I have not come across very many companies like Southwest.  Most property management companies and other agents treat tenants like trash, Ryan Whitney and Southwest worked with our clients and got them into their dream home.  It was such a refreshing change and we are very grateful.
