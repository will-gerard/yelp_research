We have two dogs and joined the Banfield plan, with the full intention of getting fantastic service while saving money. (Banfield offers a plan where you pay monthly per pet and get free office visits with basic vaccinations included, and discounts on services/medications outside of your plan. We pay $25 per dog monthly). We have been incredibly disappointed, and here's why: - Our office visits are never free, the doctors always find a way to charge you for something. One time one of their vets tried to talk us into a $150 test to see if she licked a poisonous toad.. seriously?!?  - I never feel like we are taking the dogs ta good, honest vet - Banfield feels more like a corporation that needs to hit a certain number every month - hence why they are always billing you for things you don't need and overcharging you. - With our plan, we're supposed to save money. However, I've researched local vets and their services are nearly half the price than my "discounted ones" - Every time a Banfield vet prescribes our dogs medicine, our "discounted savings" are nearly TWICE what the medicine is priced at online. - They are VERY sneaky with their plan. They do not tell you when they are renewing your annual contract. Once it's renewed, you cannot get out of it for a full year (we have tried SO many times). Of course this was never discussed when we initially signed up for it. Only in the fine print of our numerous page contract. - I'm disappointed with the quality of healthcare the dogs have received. Nobody seems to know the answer to health problems when I take them in there. I'm still waiting to hear back from a fungal culture they took 11 days ago, our poor dog is still covered in a rash.   Overall, I'm convinced Banfield and their animal plans are a scam. Support local businesses, save money and take your pets to a local pet hospital. Our contract is up next June thank goodness - that cannot come soon enough!!  I posted this same review for the Desert Ridge location because we have taken our dogs to both (in hopes that one was better than the other) - unfortunately, we had the same experience.

My husband and I have been incredibly pleased with this school for our 2 year old daughter, who attends school and extended day care. The teachers are fabulous, and you can tell they really enjoy working there and with each other. They truly act like a team and it's apparent they are all close friends with one another, which in turn creates a really fun and friendly environment for everyone.  Not only do they have wonderful lesson plans, arts and crafts - but they even have a really fun music class with Ms. Donna that our daughter LOVES! Our daughter has really blossomed in her first year at PFT and we have met great families through it as well. We look forward to sending our younger child there when she's old enough.   I always know that our daughter is safe, well cared for, and having fun at PFT - highly recommend!

If you like wine and awesome food - you MUST try My Wine Cellar. They have an awesome selection of vino, and an amazing menu. To boot, the staff and owners are wonderful people and make it a delight to come here.   My food favorites on the menu are the pizzas, a culinary masterpiece! And my favorite wine is the ONEHOPE Chardonnay - not only is it inexpensive and delish - but 50% of profits are donated to Breast Cancer charities.  Bottom line, amazing and affordable food + yummy wine + great people = A good time! :-)

I'm a little biased because I used to work here, but it truly is an outstanding restaurant. Yes,  you may have to wait a while for a table on a weekend - but it's well worth the wait! Consistent excellent food and service, and a fantastic wine selection by the glass. My favorites: Tuna Salad, Veggie Burger (amazing!), smoked salmon appetizer, and tortilla soup. Their spinach dip is also fantastic (try ordering this takeout not cooked, take it to a party, zap it in the microwave - and you'll be a hit!)

Like many new parents, I was extremely nervous about putting our baby in a daycare setting. We had our daughter at home with a nanny until she was 1, so I wasn't sure how the transition would be. This school is absolutely amazing, and it has completely changed my views on what I expected daycare to be like. First, the directors and team working the front office are so kind and welcoming. They are extremely organized, and make everything from billing, parent communication, etc. so easy. Second, we have loved all of the teachers our daughter has had (and she has been in three rooms at this point, so we've had the pleasure of meeting very many!). The first couple days at drop off there were some tears, but now our daughter is so quick to leave our arms at drop off and give her teachers a hug! We love the detailed report we get every day, and sweet notes/comments they leave us about our girl. They truly love the children they care for. Third, this school makes everything easier on parents. They provide diapers and nutritious food - that in itself saves you so much time and money each week (no packing lunches every day!). Signing in/out your child is also very easy with the finger scan system they use. Last but certainly not least, should your child not be able to attend school due to illness, family vacation, etc. they do not charge you the days you are gone! Schedule a tour and check out this place, but do it early because they will likely be on a wait list.

My family and I love this place - fantastic sushi at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is a little funky - but in a wierd way it works. We love their volcano roll - which a special but is quite frequently on the board.  A lot of people don't know about it because it's tucked away into a corner (next to Chompie's) - but for that reason it makes it seem more like a hidden gem. It's never over crowded (I don't think I've ever had to wait for a table) and the service is always great.

I've been going to this Chili's for years - the staff is always very friendly and the food is consistently good. My fav is the guiltless chicken sandwich.  I love wine, and recently they re-vamped their list which I'm really happy about. Try the ONEHOPE Sauvignon Blanc - it was great!

My fiance's parents were in town from Pennsylvania, and I thought this would be a fun place for dinner. Yes, it's a bit touristy - but the food was delicous and there was great live music. I was also impressed by their beers on tap - they even had one that was made in house that we really liked. If you're looking for a fun, out of the ordinary, night out - this is your place! It's more fun if you get into character - so be sure to wear your boots and cowboy hat!

This was the second place I went dress shopping. My mom and I had no idea what to expect - but 2.5 hours later I found my bridal gown, my mom found a dress, and we picked out the bridesmaid dresses - amazing! Sue was great, all I had to tell her was what style I liked and my price range, the third dress I tried on was perfect.  Most of my bridesmaids were out of state, so for a small fee they shipped out all of the gowns - providing great customer service the entire time. Also, only two of my eight bridesmaids had to get alterations, so they were very accurate with their sizes.  They also have a very talented seamstress that did my alterations and bussle (this costed a little bit more than I expected - but she did a beautiful job).  I highly recommend this place - it's a one stop shop for all that you need. The women working there are incredibly friendly and helpful, and they have a HUGE selection of dresses at all price points. One tip: make sure to order far in advance. It took a good 6 months for the dresses to arrive.

My family and I are always thinking "where should we go to dinner tonight?" - and we always end up at the Village Tavern for several reasons: 1. Consistently amazing food and service, 2. Diverse menu (and we have a lot of picky eaters in my familiy!, 3. Happy Hour specials, 4. Fun bar atmosphere (great to just grab a glass of wine and a snack), 5. Fun monthly wine specials  Some of my favorites: Smoked salmon appetizer (I usually do this as my dinner it's so good), Turkey Burger, Pork Loin

I LOVE the Bamboo Club - hands down the best Asian restaurant in Scottsdale. Not only is the food absolutely delicious, but it's affordable. In addition, they have a fantastic wine list - and a very knowledgeable and friendly staff. One of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale.

One of my favorite things to do in the valley. Warning: this isn't your everyday hike - it's more like an intense climb. Be sure to pack lots of water and wear appropriate clothing (I always feel sorry for tourists I see that are wearing flip flops, jeans or other uncomfortable hiking gear).  Although it's a bit strenuous, it's a fantastic workout and has beautiful views from the top!   Parking at Echo Canyon can be a nightmare on the weekends, so try to go super early or have someone drop you off/pick you up.

Love, love, love Pita Jungle. The food is absolutely delicious!!  For as many times as I've enjoyed their food, I've never actually dined in the restaurant (we always get takeout) - but judging by the crowds I always see - it is a popular spot for sure!   I have ordered several things off of their menu and loved it - I usually get the Greek Chicken salad - they give you TONS of chicken and it's so delicious!

I really love this place, mainly because they have an awesome Happy Hour 7 days a week 4 - 7pm. We always sit at the bar, the bartenders are really friendly and give great service. Their specials include: $3 draft pints, $4 Three Olives Vodka cocktails, and great food specials (I recommend the big cheese crisp for only $4!!). We went there on a Saturday, watched the Dback game, enjoyed several drinks and dinner, and our tab was under $30 - can't beat that!!  We also used Carlos O'Briens to cater a big party that we had - and it was a HUGE hit! Very moderately priced with really yummy food.

I have been a fan of the Yard House for years, how could you not love a place with over 100 beers on tap? While I love the food, things do seem a little bit pricey. I highly recommend going during Happy Hour, because you get half off all appetizers and discounted pints (and their portions are huge, so you could easily fill up on one appetizer). My favorite is their spicey tuna roll (warning: it doesn't look like your typical sushi but it's oh, so delicious!)

This is one of Scottsdale's hidden gems - all wine drinkers need to stop in. Tom (the owner) has a fantastic selection of wine - and he marks them up fractions compared to other wine shops. He's extremely knowledgeable and can recommend the perfect bottle of wine for your tastes. If you're looking for a particular bottle that he doesn't sell, he can easily get it in for you, too.   Cheers!

Recently under new ownership, and we've noticed a much better selection of wines that they offer. We love the happy hour! - and they offer TONS of fun wines to try by the glass. Our favorite: the ONEHOPE Merlot - it was more like a bordeaux blend, and oh so good! Very affordable, and half of the profits get donated to charity. We'll definitely be coming back to Enotria!

We love this place - it's our "go-to" sports bar. Cozy atmosphere, tons of televisions to watch the game, and for a sports bar - the food is actually REALLY good! Try any one of their focaccias - their my favorite.   Really good happy hour specials, too! Love that we can get two huge beers and dinner for under $20.  My only wish: That they had 2 shuffle board tables. We are here all of the time and it is always taken!

I am usually never one to complain, but my best friend (and all 7 of her bridesmaids - myself included) really got jipped by this place. Don't get me wrong, they carry a beautiful variety of dresses, but their customer service is absolutely appalling. Here's what happened:  All seven of us got measured by their employees for our Melissa Sweet dresses back in late November. The store model that I tried on fit me perfectly, so they didn't even have to measure me - they just ordered the size I tried on. Another one of the bridemaids actually purchased two dresses (in different colors) because she had to wear it in another wedding this summer.   Five months later, the dresses arrive - and they don't fit ANYONE, they are ridiculously small on ALL SEVEN bridesmaids. Rather than owning up to her measuring mistake, the owner for lack of better words told the bride that ALL SEVEN bridesmaids must have gained weight (thanks a lot, lady!).  Since I wasn't even measured, I asked if I could try on the store model that fit me so well back in November. When I did, it STILL fit me perfectly. I was then told "the dress has been tried on so many times, so the fabric tends to stretch." Well then why wasn't I told this when I ordered it?  I have been a bridesmaid in several weddings and I understand that sometimes dresses need alterations. But what was disappointing was how the owner refused to take responsibility, pointed the finger at all of us for "gaining weight," and made all of us pay for our own alterations.  Oh, and remember the bridesmaid that bought the same dress in a different color for another wedding? ALL FIVE of that bride's bridesmaids had the same exact problem. Hmm.. interesting...  When your big day comes, this is the last thing you'll want to deal with - save yourself (and bridesmaids) the trouble and shop somewhere else.

Flo's is absolutely delicious! Their hot and sour soup is an absolute must, as are the lettuce wraps and cashew chicken! GREAT happy hour as well. Their wine list could use a little work though..

My fiance and I love eating here - their pizza is absolutely delicious! Very unique offerings (like a BLT pizza, they even have one with eggs!). We try to order something different every time we go, and we have never been disappointed.   Oh - and the wine!! They have a great list with all price ranges - and the staff is very knowledgeable to help you pick out the perfect bottle. They also have a good beers on tap.  It's the perfect spot for a casual night out!

Great sushi in a really fun atmosphere. My favorite is the spicy tuna roll.. yum!  They also have a great happy hour (both regular and reversed), live music, and the restaurant overall has a really fun atmosphere.  My husband and I came here and had a wonderful dinner. We had the most delicious bottle of wine -"ONEHOPE" Cabernet Sauvignon. Not only was it yummy - but the company donates 50% of profits to charity.  Our experience at Electric Eel was great!

Unbelievable selection of wine and beer - and their prices are some of the best I've seen in the valley.   Plus, the store itself is beautiful inside, and it's huge! And it's very shopper friendly, everything is merchandised very well and is in alphabetical order by varietal.   Several times a month they host wine tastings (which I believe are complementary), so keep your eye out for those!

Whenever I go here, it is packed - and for a good reason, the yogurt they offer is delicious - and they have a great variety of flavors and toppings. I love the self-serve concept, but be careful not to fill up your cup too much - it's a bit pricey and they charge in weight. (They only offer a one size cup that is huge - so if you fill it up with toppings you're likely to spend close to $10 for a cup of yogurt!)

I went here for the first time to get an oil change and car wash (heard about them through Groupon when looking for an oil change). The local car wash I used to go to closed, so I was excited to possibly find a new "go-to spot". The oil change was super fast and easy. However, I was disappointed when they refused to do a free wash, as they normally do with oil changes, because I purchased through Groupon. Not a great way to welcome a possible new customer - I won't be returning.

Levi was awesome! First, he responded incredibly fast when I originally contacted him, and was able to come the next day. Not only did Levi change all of our locks, but he also upgraded many of our door handles to ensure we couldn't easily get locked out (something I never thought about!). He pays close attention to detail, you can tell he truly cares about getting the job done perfectly. Levi also installed a keypad for our front door, that works great and is so useful! He came right on time and did a fantastic job - highly recommend.

This is one of our favorite pizza places - for the food, value, drinks and great atmosphere! I originally discovered them at the Scottsdale Culinary Festival, and am so happy I did!  It is in a great location, walking distance to a bunch of fun bars so it's a great place to start the night in Old Town. My husband and I's favorite thing on the menu is the margarita pizza. The crust is so crisp and perfect! As for drinks, Jac's has a really fun cocktail menu, and also a good wine selection. Our favorite: the ONEHOPE Cabernet Sauvignon. Affordable, smooth, and pretty cool that half of the profits are donated to charity.  Definitely check this place out, you'll love it!

Even though there were more employees than customers in the store, I still had to wait 45 minutes to see someone. When I finally did, they were no help. Don't waste your time at this store - hopefully you'll have better luck somewhere else. Never coming here again.

This is one of our favorite places to get dinner to-go. Very affordable and wonderful food.  Our favorites are the Tokyo Chicken Salad, Yaki-Soba with tofu, and the Chicken Teriyaki bowl. The sushi is just so-so, but as is most sushi when you order to go.  I've never eaten at the restaurant, but from what I see when I pick up the food it's a little dark and uninviting. Their wine list is pretty weak, too - so that's why we always do take out and eat it at home.
