Great little place in town! After a long scary hike on Picacho peak and a tour of the U of A Biosphere 2 this was the perfect place to finally get a delicious warm meal that hit the spot! I got chicken fried steak with gravy hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and rye buttered toast! Way better than Denny's any day and their portions were so generous! Delicious meals for a great price! My husband got the Tag's mexican dish special: green chili enchiladas and shredded beef tacos! We left full and satisfied on our way home to Tempe! Perfect place if your passing through the town and are hungry for some delicious food! I love that they have a breakfast menu all day! Highly recommended and my food was cooked perfectly!

Best Indian buffet out there! All the best classic dishes and a variety of desserts! This is our favorite place!  My husband loves spicy and I can't handle it so here he has the option to put as much spicy sauce on as he wants while I can have a yummy meal without dying from the heat. And who can beat the price for all the food you get?

Man, I really want to like this place... I've walked by this place over a hundred times and have never been in. I got out of class early today and decide to treat myself and get their Caramel Mocha boba (so called most popular) that they advertise on the window. First sip was interesting seems alright, then the second sip was just getting worse. Boba was hard inside and hadn't been soaked long enough so the boba itself was small and hard inside and bland on the outside... Then can the really sweet taste like pure sugar water, then came the weird flavor of artificial mocha with caramel. I remember seeing in the back how they made it and I think they are all made out of a powder mixture. Something just definitely didn't taste right... Either had artificial sweeteners in it or bad tasting water in the mixture. I've had a lot of boba and this is by far the worst one ever... I'm so sad and disappointed, I really wanted it to be good! $3.99 for boba which comes out to $4.35 is pretty pricey for boba but that's what you get for being near ASU I wouldn't have mind the price if it was actually good. It's such a cute place that has so much potential!

Our new favorite pizza place!!! How can u beat your very own customized pizza made just for u?? With fresh ingredients and anyway you want it?? For under $8 bucks?? Amazing place, they definitely need to expand and take over subways! Lol pizzas are made perfectly with a perfect crust! The dough is not too thick and not too thin just perfect amount to tie the pizza together! Pizzas are bigger than your average "personal sized pizzas" enough for even leftovers! So good!! Love it!!
