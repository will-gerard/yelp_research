I saw "The Glass Menagerie" at Herberger Theater last night (3/27) and not only was the play great but the Herberger staff made the entire experience memorable. As a first-timer I appreciated the attention and thoughtful each theater-goer received. I'll definitely be back for "The Second City Does Arizona, Or Close, But No Saguaro."

This historic deli is one of a handful of places Downtown where I've never had a bad experience. The pastrami and corned beef are the best in town and the French fries and chicken noodle soup are brilliant co-stars.   Downtown Deli is definitely a place to go if you're eating in because the walls are covered with interesting pieces of Phoenix memorabilia and it's always busy at noon, making you feel as though you're smack dab in the middle of a bustling urban environment.   One tip: You'll want to bank on taking an extended lunch because digesting a Downtown Deli sandwiches is a real chore. Of course I mean that in the very best way.

Trustworthy. Thorough. Dependable. Tucked on the corner of 32nd Street and Oak this longtime Central Phoenix repair shop has been my go-to for about 4 years. They get to know their customers and the cars they drive and never ever upsell. If you don't really need a repair they'll tell you it can wait. They'll give you a ride to work and pick you up when your vehicle is done. These are good people who do good work for an honest rate.

It's a consignment shop, so it's always going to be hit or miss inventory wise, but what I'm far more concerned about is the staff.   It's totally OK if you want to employ angry hipsters exclusively but just make sure they're *somewhat* congenial. I counted at least four stink eyes during my last visit for seemingly innocent offenses ranging from knocking a pair of jeans off their cheap clippy hangers to putting a pair of Dr. Martens back on the shelf two spots down from where I grabbed them. C'mon, man. I'm sure people commit much more egregious fouls.  I'll keep going back because I love the thrill of the hunt but I won't do so expecting to be charmed.

Unfortunately, yesterday's visit was one of the worst dining experiences I've had during my 10 years in Phoenix. The food was sub-awful (seriously, a cheese crisp that a 7-year-old deems inedible?), the service was terrible (zero smiles, and I had to basically tackle our server get the check, much less some refills on water glasses), and the atmosphere was equal to that of the third lunch shift at a nursing home.  I won't go back. Ever.

As much as I wanted to love the Swizzle Inn my first experience was uninspired.  The regulars bellied up at the bar were all varying degrees of creepy, I never felt very welcome, and the joint wasn't nearly as raucous as I'd hoped it would be. I was told the juke box was great but all I heard during my 45 minutes was Barry Manilow and Grand Funk Railroad.   It wasn't all bad. The prices are extremely wallet friendly and I dug the bartender a lot, so I'll definitely go back and give the Swizz another chance. Hopefully my update will be much more favorable.

Never been a huge Houston's guy. It's too dark, the menu is too limited, and while the food is good it somehow always fails to live up to the hype. Not bad, but not memorable, either.  From what I understand, Hillstone is an amped-up Houston's, like a luxury badge on a Marriot hotel. Yawn.   I tell you all this because heading into my first visit to Hillstone tonight I had zero expectations. None. Well, other than expecting to be underwhelmed.  Shame on me, because Hillstone hit a home run.  A beautifully appointed, thoughtfully designed, approachably classy  indoor/outdoor dining venue, Hillstone offers the same dressed-down menu of a Houston's, but in a nicer setting with truly elite service.  Kaitlyn, our server, was attentive and exactly the right level of chipper. She was pleasing to both my 7-year-old niece as well as my 65-year-old mother. That's no easy feat. The burger was perfect, the beverages were never empty, the table was cleared on time, the check was dropped off and picked up seamlessly and the staff was always around but never a nuisance.   And I love the setting. From the bar to the bathrooms everything just works. There are romantic corner booths and more lively center room talbes and the patio is gorgeous, with a perfect view of bustling Camelback Road.   Whether it's a business meeting or a first date, Hillstone will definitely get my repeat business.

My family and I are regulars at Wally's because at Wally's, regulars are family.  Beyond the deep, deep personal connection I have with the restaurant I can tell you that the food is unquestionably great and the service is always top-notch. (There are a few servers and bartenders who have been there since the place opened 10 years ago.)   My favorite menu items are as follows: 1) Cuban Panini 2) Frisco Burger 3) Meatloaf 4) Pot Roast 5) Spaghetti. The fact that Wally's can do all five of those things extremely well should tell you all you need to know.  There is something old school cool about a joint where the Proprietor is almost always present and Wally's is that place. He's the guy with the grey hair and beard who probably handed you your menu. Tell him I said hello and that the Price family loves him like their own.

The only place I'll ever go when I need a seasonal faux tan.   My visits typically take 45 minutes--15 to tan, 30 to chew the fat with Sandy. The Proprietors here are so awesome you won't care that the beds are a little older or that there's dust on the self-tune radio. As for the pricing, I highly doubt anybody else in the Arcadia area can compete. (I think you can get two weeks of unlimited tanning for some absurdly low price of like $30)  I've never used their spray tanning but I've heard nothing but good reviews.   As mentioned in earlier reviews, Camelback Tanning is located next to Thai Lana, arguably CenPho's greatest Thai restaurant. So next time you're in the 38th St/Indian School area stop and see Sandy at Camelback Tanning, and then head two doors down for some of the best Pad Thai you'll ever eat.

Temari doesn't look like much when spotted from busy Val Vista Drive but don't judge a book by its cover. Inside this quirky strip mall Japanese eatery awaits some seriously tasty sushi. We ordered three massive rolls--Saki, Something Bad, and Tropical--and each one packed a ton of fresh flavors (we liked the Something Bad roll best). The service was efficient (fist bump for the dollop of strawberry ice cream served with our post-dinner fortune cookies) and the setting was quiet and comfortable. I will definitely recommend Temari to all of my friends, especially those living on the East Side.

Excruciatingly slow service, even for a Sunday morning. Good thing they didn't give me flack for bringing in my own coffee because it would have been 20 minutes before I got a cup from them.  The food was OK (I could be meaner about the slightly undercooked eggs) but I was more than a little miffed by conspicuous absence of steak and eggs. Isn't steak and eggs on the Mt. Rushmore of American breakfast?  Then there was the Tomato Juice Debacle. My uncle asked for a glass of tomato juice. Waitress says, "Is V8 OK?" Uncle says sure. Waitress disappears for what seems like a day and a half before returning to say, "Um, sorry, we're out." She disappears again, only to return with, "I found some! But it's warm." Uncle says no sweat, just put it in some ice. Waitress disappears again and returns with a glass of warm V8 sans ice. True story.

Swan has been pressing my shirts for 10 years. Our family gets a discount that is well-deserved and we are always greeted by name. The hours have been decreased in recent months (no longer open Saturdays), which is inconvenient, but the family connection and reliable service trumps all. There are bigger, fancier dry cleaners within a mile of Swan but they'll never put a crease in my slacks.

A dozen or so cohorts and I gathered for last week's Vikings/Packers game and the service was spectacular. We arrived 15 minutes before kickoff and as you can imagine the place was being overun with purple jerseys. To accomodate our large party the manager opened up the previously roped off back room and gave us free rein of the joint. It seems like the obvious play but you'd be surprised how many bar managers don't see the value in going the extra mile for bigger parties.   Our table shared a plate of nachos (A-), cheese bread (B+), and soft pretzels (A+) before diving into beer breads (A++) and burgers (B). It's not high brow fare but it is bar food done right.   As a Minnesotan I'm probably totally biased when it comes to reviewing a Vikings bar but I truly believe that the beer bread and Hop Knot are elite, regardless of where you're from, Wisconsin goofs included.

What I liked: 1) The pulled pork burrito was tasty; 2) They let me charge my phone at the bar; 3)  The strawberry shortcake a la mode (served with a biscuit instead of sponge cake) was pretty much amazing.  What I did not like: 1) Waiting 15 minutes for a table when half the establishment was empty; 2) Our server telling us they were out of Shiner Bock even though the gentlemen seated to our right were clearly drinking it; 3) The same server and her middle management goons trying to rush us out the door, ignoring the fact that we were still ordering beers and food; 4) The girl seated behind us who didn't wear a belt. Or underwear.  To summarize...  Gilley's Food = Not as bad as you'd guess  Gilley's Service = Worse than you could expect

I'm more than a little ashamed that Wag N' Wash has been operating out of Melrose for three years and I'm just now discovering its unbrided awesomeness.   My pug / French bulldog, Zeke, sheds like a muther so bathing him at home can be quite messy. So today we (well, technically Zeke didn't really weigh in on the decision) opted to check out Wag N' Wash and it was a convenient and fun experience.  There are several attendants at the ready, waiting to assist and answer questions and they were quick to pick up on the fact that Zeke doesn't care for strangers getting up in his business none too much. They smiled and kept their distance while remaining attentive to my first-timiness needs.  Rich and the gals at the cashier's counter were extremely patient and congenial as I weighed my add-on options and they gave me a nice recap on how Wag N' Wash originated and some of their more boutique-y offerings.  While I got a little spend-happy, Wag N' Wash doesn't have to be an expensive stop. I think you can get in and out with a basic wash for a little over $10, which is a no-brainer value considering that using their wash and dry stations, plus grooming instruments and product, saves you a ton of time and money.   I'll definitely go back next time Zeke needs freshening up.

Since moving to CenPho I've been auditioning go-to neighborhood bars and Sunday's potential watering hole was 16th Street Sports Bar and Grill, a harmless-looking tavern located on 16th Street (duh) between Bethany Home and Glendale. I think it's between a karate studio and a pet groomer, or maybe a chiropractor and a temp agency. I'm not sure, but you get the point.  Anyway, it took me about four minutes to become smitten. Here's the breakdown:  1) Service -- Bartender Jason was laid-back, welcoming, attentive, and chatty, you know, like bartenders are supposed to be but unfortunately so often are not. Grade: A (Extra credit for giving me 10 percent off for checking in on Yelp.)  2) Food -- I had a patty melt, which was juicy and quite delicious. And the fries were hot and golden. If you're a bar kitchen that can successfully pull off a basic burger and fries order, you've probably put yourself into the 80th percentile. Grade: B+  3) Drinks -- Great beer selection and tons of happy hour, daily deals. And the bar is ideal for bellying up to. Grade: A-  4) Atmosphere -- I mostly need a bar that will show Twins games and 16th Street Bar and Grill offers all of the sports packages on a number of flat screens located throughout the bar. They also have a large smoking area if you're into that kind of thing and a game room in the back with darts, video games and pool.   This is the kind of place where you meet new friends and I think I've found myself a new home away from home.

Monkeypants is an unassuming watering hole on the corner of Mill and Southern in Tempe, holding down an anchor space in a strip mall next to a tire shop. Not a great sale so far, I know.   BUT, what's so great about Monkeypants is that it's not about flash or sizzle, or about broad appeal. It's a goofy little neighborhood bar with sassy waitresses who serve up delicious wings and cold beer. The juke box plays everything from Ludicris to Grand Funk Railroad, there's plenty of sports on TV, and the expansive patio (along with no-nonsense bouncers) keeps the riff raff out.   If you're looking for Affliction T-shirts and overly tan women in short skirts, Monkeypants is definitely not the bar for you, but if you want to share postgame laughs with your softball team while eating food that's not very good for you, you can't do much better than the Pants.

Just ate the spicy chicken wrap, which was hot, packed with veggies, and perfectly seasoned. The portion was huge, probably 20 percent bigger than a Chipotle burrito, and two meals for $7.99 is a tremendous value, especially given how comparitively healthy Pita Jungle's entrees are. Also, the take-out order was ready exactly when it was promised.  One harsh bit of criticism: Don't be cheap with the pocket bread; one piece rolled up in foil is totally insufficient for a 7-10 oz. tub of hummus. If you're ordering you have to request additional bread or you're going to have some lonely leftover hummus.  I haven't eaten in yet, but the atmosphere seems fun and diverse--everyone from shaggy haired hipsters to the Dockers-wearing crowd. And there's a bar, which is always helpful.

I hate tire shopping. Like most things car repair/maintenance related, it's pretty much an invitation to be violated.  But unfortunately, tires wear down, and we aren't at a place technologically where steel-belted radials can regenerate on their own.  A neighbor recommended Community Tire, and some research on Yelp confirmed their solid reputation in an industry that's otherwise inhabited by snakes.   Eric, the manager at Community Tire's University/40th Street location was really friendly on the phone. He quoted me a price I could live with and guaranteed me that they could turn the job around in an hour.  Not only did I pay *exactly* what Eric quoted me (no hidden rubber taxes), but not once did anyone at Community Tire try to upsell me on the tires or services. They checked my brakes and alignment for nothing, and had me back on the road in like 40 minutes. Pretty amazing service from start to finish and a refreshing alternative to the Big Name shops.   One more side note: Their lounge is really nice. Clean and comfortable with a flat screen and current magazines like Sports Illustrated and People, plus a popcorn machine, water dispenser, and coffee.

You wouldn't expect one of the best Thai restaurants in Phoenix to be located in a non-descript NoPho strip mall but it does. Sala Thai not only serves up quick, fresh, dependable and competitively priced Thai meals (which come out with a spice rating of 1 to 5 based on your heat tolerance ... 4 is plenty hot), but the servings are such that I always have enough leftovers to bring to work for lunch the next day. Great value. And I put a premium on value. One of the intangible qualities of Sala is that it's become somewhat of a community driver, a third space where you're as likely to run into a neighbor as you are to leave with a full and satisfied stomach.

Steve's, one of Downtown's oldest diners, hosted the after-hours breakfast during Saturday's Downtown Pub Crawl and bravo to the management and staff for recognizing the tremendous opportunity the event presented.   That night Steve's was transformed from a quaint lunch spot into an open-air discotheque. Amazing.  The patio was packed with Crawlers enjoying their breakfast and dancing to crowd-pleasers like Cupid's "Shuffle" and LMFAO's "Shots," with a beer in one hand and yummy bacon in the other. There were moments when I actually forgot where I was and I was sober as a judge!  The $5.95 breakfast was perfect and the staff was super friendly considering the mass of drunken humanity it was dealing with until 3 a.m.  Great job, Steve's!

I'm astonished that Bell Cleaners has survived the recent Recession let alone the last 30 years. The pickup and drop-off experience, which they tout in the About narrative on their web site, is non-existent, and was only memorable due to incompetence.  Today I waited 15 minutes, in the dark, while the only attendant on site searched aimlessly for my order, stopping five times to check her incoming text messages no less. Once she finally located my 11 shirts and 2 pair of khakis, she offered no apology or explanation and simply stuck her hand out, in silence, in what I deduced was a request for payment. What's worse is that they wanted nearly $15 for two pair of basic khakis. When I asked about the high price the attendant looked downward and mouthed something incoherent, again sticking her hand out.  I will say that $22.55 for 11 shirts is reasonable, but not so great a deal that I won't go elsewhere. If you have money (and time) to burn on martinizing, be my guest.

Rogue Dead Guy Maibock, Pepperoni Wheels, and Team Trivia. The rest is kinda irrelevant.  The beer list is absurdly good, the food is cheap and delicious, and the music is kept at levels that are pleasing to the senses while staying conversation friendly.  I expected Boulders to be a college bar but there were plenty of Oldy Olsens like myself hanging out and enjoying the fine spirits and Team Trivia. The wide range of affable, good-looking peeps was really a nice surprise.  The only criticism I can offer up here is the state of the men's bathroom, which was a disaster area. Really, really, gross. But I'm a dude, so whatever.  Boulders isn't in my 'hood but it's definitely worth the drive.

It's unfortunate that Jacquee's is basically hidden from anybody who doesn't work in or near the Renaissance building because the sandwiches are TDF.   Today I had a Hot Ham & Cheese on a kaiser roll with jalapeno, lettuce, avocado and side of love. I usually stick to the wraps (Thai Chicken = Dope) but I can also vouch for the Chicken Salad on cranberry walnut bread. The potato salad is also quite tasty.   Jacquee's is a perfect take-and-eat mom and pop sandwich shop that cares enough to use Boar's Head meats and cheeses and fresh bread.   Perhaps next time you're about to give Subway your $7 you'll consider giving it to Jacquee's instead.

I've never been overly impressed with Sports Authority but my experience at the Camelback Corridor location yesterday guarantees that I won't ever go back.  1. Unhelpful, humorless staff 2. Lackluster shoe selection 3. Disgusting bathrooms 4. Depressing shopping environment  I was meandering through the shoe department for at least 10 minutes and at no time did any of the dozen employees on the floor say hello or ask me how I was doing. Not only that but their selection of running shoes can be reduced to two categories: 1) Nike 2) Other Brands' Least Appealing Models.  On my way out I stopped by the sales rack only to discover that nothing bigger than size medium was discounted. That's a shame because non-gnomes deserve price breaks, too.  I'll drive out to Dick's next time.

My favorite Thai spot in Downtown, mostly because it's such a feel-good story. Thai Elephant was at the forefront of Downtown's dining Renaissance, opening in 2008 and quickly bucking trends and becoming a popular lunch destination that was also open for dinner and on weekends. Today, Downtown is a much bigger player in the Valley's restaurant scene and the newcomers owe a debt of gratitude to eateries like Thai Elephant, Hanny's and District American Kitchen and Wine Bar and the restaurateurs who weren't afraid to do Downtown. The food at Thai Elephant is dependable and cost-friendly (you and a date can get out of there for about 20 bucks before tip).  My favorite dish is Pad Thai but then again I'm not exactly a risk-taker when it comes to Asian fare. I also enjoy the soup that comes with every entree. The only downside is how quickly Thai Elephant tries to turn its tables. It's small and demand is high so it's unlikely the staff will let you enjoy a long post-meal conversation with your lovely. They are mostly friendly with their words but their eyes are usually saying, "You don't have to go home but you can't stay here." Still, it's hard to make a list of the best Downtown restaurants that doesn't include Thai Elephant.

I'll never eat Y.C.'s again.  Not that Y.C.'s Mongolian BBQ is awful (although it kinda is), it's just that Genghi's does the whole build-your-own-stir-fry thing so much better, with fresher ingredients, that I don't see the point in lowering my standards for any other comp.  I'm glad I don't live closer to one of Genghi's Valley locations because I'd end up eating there more often that I'd like to admit.  My favorite concotion involves bean sprouts, beef, water chestnuts, lots of bell peppers, baby corn, two eggs, and dragon sauce over brown rice. It's just perfect.

Classic Mojito, Plantain and Avocado Spring Rolls, Fred's Jerk Chicken Sandwich, French Press Coffee shared with Sweet Potato Pie a la Mode, plus exemplary service with a smile by Holly.   Cozy den, perfect for a date or just catching up with a friend. My partner in crime and I shot the crap for 3 hours and never once were we given any indication that it was anything less than completely cool.  That's how you do it, Breadfruit. Good on you.  Side Note: I don't even particularly like rum.

Made my first stop at Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burgers today and the joint (har) definitely lived up to the hype. I Hoovered a delicious chili cheeseburger with perfectly seasoned sweet potato fries (hand-cut, I'm pretty sure) and paired it with a Grape Shasta. The $8 tab is a little more than I generally like to spend but the meal was so dang good I could care less what it cost. Plus, KSLX provided a fitting Beatles soundtrack--all post-1965, so controlled substances were well represented. Those Two Hippies make a mean burger. Stop in and see 'em.

The perfect place for day drinking and brunch on a lazy weekend, Maizee's benefits from an ideal location right off the rail and not far from shopping up the Camelback Corridor. Give me a San Tan Devil's Ale on tap and the Tangy Turkey wrap any day of the week. The Ancho Salmon Salad is also the cat's pajamas.   Beyond the reliable food and casual atmosphere, Maizie's delivers on service, which in this town is never a given.

With all apologies to The Downtown Deli, The Hero Factory makes the best sandwiches Downtown. Owner Nicole is a laugh riot and she and her staff churn out bigger-than-your-head sandwiches at great prices (especially when you consider that their subs are really two meals). I'm a wrap guy and their club, buffalo chicken and Ceasar wraps are all top notch.   The only tip I'd give is to come early because by high noon the line is spilling out the door.

Top 3 Happy Hour in Downtown, always with a nice selection of beers on tap. And if you're hungry there's a wide variety of food by Chef Jay--everything from finger grub to thoughtful entrees--that always hits its mark. District gets extra credit for using locally produced meats and produce (they also have their own rooftop garden), and their weekend brunches are no joke.

Breakfast Joynt and I got off on the wrong foot when I was forced to wait 15 minutes for coffee. I get it, it's Sunday morning and the waitress had a lot of balls (or waffles) in the air but under no circumstance should a breakfast customer wait 15 minutes for coffee. It's just unacceptable. It's an even worse business strategy to make ME wait 15 minutes for coffee when I'm hungry. I'm a real bear that way. BUT, once the coffee pot landed and we got our orders in the food came out very fast and it was amazing. Probably the best eggs Benedict I've had in years. I ordered them California-style with avocado and bacon. The avocado was ripe and the bacon was crisp. Eggs were poached to perfection and I was given just the right amount of Hollandaise. As a bonus, Breakfast Joynt weaves caramelized onion into their hashbrowns. Big league move, that is.  I'm strongly considering making the Breakfast Joynt a post-church Sunday staple.

Cherry combines the ambiance of an upscale salon and mixes it with the culture and energy of a corner barbershop. Everyone is very chatty and the stylists are constantly giving one another shit. Maybe it's not for everyone but I totally dig the vibe.  Terry Smith is a personable and accomplished stylist who has cut my hair off and on for 10 years. I recommend him enthusiastically.  If you're looking for a marked upgrade from Great Clips but don't want to be surrounded by pretentious fashionistas, check out Cherry the Salon and see what you think.

Make sure to check in on Yelp to get a buy one/get one credit.  The Biltmore store is a ton of fun with its goofy red floor and its looping cartoons. And you may even run into a pro athlete (Suns' forward Grant Hill, who opened the door for my niece, who about died when I told her who he was).  Mojo is not cheap, but the service and atmosphere are superb and I'd say the price point for the total experience is about right. Kids and adults appreciate the sample cups and the ingredient bar is always well stocked.   For lactose hating guts, Mojo offers a dairy-free yogurt, which I'd never put in my mouth but seems like a very nice gesture toward the afflicted.

Last night's Flamenco Night was a gas. Great crowd, Prickly Pear Margaritas, Four Peaks Hop Knot on tap, and a wonderful patio for enjoying the night breeze. Guacamole and chips sounds like entry level fare but Gallo Blanco's is on its own level. I'd probably wear the guacaomle as war paint it's so fresh and flavorful. I can also speak for the carne asada tacos, which are pretty good for Gringo Mexican. Next time I will try the burger and maybe a white sangria, which looks amazing with its chunks of fruit floating at the top.

Coffee: Decent, but didn't blow my skirt up Set-up: Nice decor, lots of room to spread out Service: Awful. Don't make me feel like I'm inconveniencing you. I can and will take my business where it's appreciated (Fair Trade, Cartel/Conspire or Lux, for example) Atmosphere: TURN THE FRIGGIN ELECTRONICA DOWN! I enjoy scheduling meetings off-site but not where I need to use sign language to communicate with my vendors.   IMPORTANT: My experiences at Lola Downtown have always been good and I'll continue to go there. The layout isn't as conducive for meetings but the service and music are much improved, which of course make the coffee taste just a little less bitter.

Viet Kitchen opened a second location at 114 W. Adams St. in Downtown Phoenix (tucked between Downtown dining stallwarts The Hero Factory and Z Pizza) today and it was packed! While I kept it light with the spring rolls--extremely fresh and they use the clear white paper I like so much--folks sitting around me were enjoying the tofu with vegetables, vermicelli, and classic beef pho bowl. Despite being overwhelmed by first-day traffic, the servers and kitchen did a great job getting the food out hot and fast. Great job!  Owners Jenny and Tom Nguyen are the nicest people you'll ever meet so I do urge you to give them a try. You won't regret it.  I'm excited for the Downtown location to be unlocked so I can start checking in once or twice a week.

The cool factor at Giant is off the charts. The open-air venue, apart from the front-row view of a CVS pharmacy, is awesome, and I love the layout with its variety of seating options. You can't beat being located a block from the McDowell/Central light rail station.  The Wi-Fi performs very well and the coffee was above average. If I worked a little closer I'd probably list Giant at No. 2 in my Coffee Power Rankings, behind almighty Cartel.   Whether you're trying to get some work done, having a business meeting, or just catching up with a friend, Giant is an option I'd strongly recommend.  One criticism: I do not like the $5 minimum on credit cards. I understand it, but I sure as heck don't like it.

Very cool shop with an ecclectic mix of odd-ball, vintage, reconditioned and original furnishings, plus some local jewery and art. Every room has its own vibe and the music (Joy Division!!) is too legit to quit.  Leonardo does some really creative things with the window display so you should stop in and say hello.

Had my first Matador the other day and thought it pretty much rocked   Unlike its sister shop on Central, this Lola keeps it simple with good coffee served by friendly staffers who spin vinyl at a reasonable volume. Reliable Wi-Fi, too.  This location is ideal for catching up with an old friend or relaxing with a magazine.

This is my regular coffee joint so be prepared for a totally biased review.   I was drowning in a sea of Starbucks before Cartel came and saved my life. Now, instead of drinking Daniel Plainview-approved office sludge I can skip three blocks and belly up at Cartel's friendly bar, continue working using their reliable Wi-Fi, and chat up friendly staff and regulars while enjoying to-die-for drips. And now that Adam Reeder's kitchen is cranking out Digby plates and Downtown's best tuna sandwich (for best results, place the potato chips ON the sandwich) Cartel is able to meet your needs for breakfast and lunch. Check out their afternoon pastry happy hour and get tasty cookies (made daily by Adam's sister) for half-price.  Hopefully one day in Downtown's near future we can support a place like Cartel enough that they can stay open for dinner and on weekends.   Dare to dream.

Easily the best experience I've had at Pita Jungle since they aggressively expanded. The space is open, inviting and tasteful, there are separate bar and dining rooms, and window seats make for a surprisingly romantic setting. I don't usually equate Pita Jungle with romance.   (Only layout criticism: The bathrooms are cozy, and not in a good way.)  The food was reliable as per usual (although the bread was a little stiff, which tends to be the case later in the day) but what set the Roosevelt location apart from PJs on 44th/Indian School and Scottsdale was the service. This girl had worked a long day (she recounted 15 and 20-top services she'd administered over the dinner rush) but her attitude was meadow fresh. (Sometimes I get a sense that PJ servers are allowed to be rough around the edges in an attempt to earn hipster cred but thankfully not here.)   I could eat the chicken and hummus plate with extra cucumber all day long and when I do I'll do it from this Roosevelt spot.

Convenient Location. Warm and Talented Staff. First-Class Amenities. Most Insurance Accepted.  If you're looking for a new dentist in Downtown Phoenix I enthusiastically recommend Dr. Ben Berschler and his staff at Downtown Phoenix Dental.  Last week I had my fangs cleaned by Heather and she was careful, engaging and quick. No guilt trips about not flossing enough and more than a few playful anecdotes to help pass the time.   Dr. Ben is a Philly guy who recently located his practice to Phoenix. Friendly, but to the point, he quickly assessed my X-rays post-cleaning and said everything was great with the possible exception of the 20-year-old silver fillings that take up way too much space in my mouth. He didn't pressure me into swapping them out but made the benefits easy to recognize.  Today we began the process and I was astonished how well it went. How many dentists give you a hot-off-the-presses issue of The Sporting News to read while the novocain takes effect? And how many let you listen to Counting Crows' August and Everything After while he goes to town on your teeth? ("Anna Begins" will never sound the same.) Plus, Dr. Ben has the very latest in equipment and technology, most of which I'd never seen before. We're talking cutting-edge stuff here. The office is nicely decorated and contemporary and both Heather and office manager/assistant Robin are an absolute pleasure to interact with.   I can't say enough great things about the Downtown Phoenix Dental crew. Go now. Your teeth will thank you.

The owners of this fast-casual Asian diner on ASU's Downtown campus, brothers Jack and Ben Juang, put heart and soul into every family inspired creation and their passion comes through in every forkful (I only use chopsticks if I'm on a date or trying to eat slowly).   I've been a huge fan since Hsin Cafe first opened its doors in the spring and will continue to champion their stellar menu, which includes fantastic chow mein, fried rice, curry and teryaki bowls, as well as signature entrees that showcase BBQ pork, beef, shrimp and chicken.  My current favorite is beef chow mein but I can honestly say that I've tried everything on the Hsin Cafe menu and not once have Ben and Jack disappointed.   The portions are large so it's entirely possible that you're spending $5-7 on two meals--perfect for students or any workaday Downtowner on a budget.

It's the nicest, cleanest gym in or around Downtown Phoenix. And because it's new (and probably because it's not cheap), it's less-crowded than any gym in or around Downtown Phoenix.  The staff knows you by name, the trainers are knowledgeable and actually look like trainers, and technologically Gold's is light years ahead of... wait for it... any gym in or around Downtown Phoenix.  The machines are brand new and there's plenty of variety. There's a cardio theater, tons of class options, and virtually every cardio machine has its own TV.   I've been a member at 24HR Fitness, Lifetime Fitness, and Scottsdale Community College and none of those facilities are on the same plane as Gold's Elite.   Are there some drawbacks? Of course. The locker room is peculiar in its layout. And there is some sort of plumbing issue there, evidenced by standing water in the shower area. BUT, in that same locker room, every toiletry is provided, lest toothbrushes, and I end up smelling better when I leave than when I entered.   I'm training with Jake, who is a former Div-I football player and a heckuva nice guy. He also kicks my butt.   The YMCA is very nice but I prefer the roominess of Gold's, not to mention the fact that I've never had to fight with anyone over a machine.

I had met Downtown Salon Phoenix owner Trankie Romero a few weeks ago and dug his general vibe. So when I decided to audition stylists closer to my Downtown office, it seemed logical to give one of his girls a try.   So glad I did.  Before turning on the clippers or grabbing the shears Ruth actually talked to me about what I wanted to do with my hair. It sounds like a no-brainer strategy but you'd be surprised how few stylists ask the right questions or really take the time to listen.   I got a very relaxing wash and condition and a great haircut for about the same money I was paying Uptown. Great value given the convenience of being located a block from my office.   As a bonus, the young woman at the front desk was attentive and beyond nice. Reception is another service element many salons fail to grasp. Great job, Trankie!  I love keeping my money in the Downtown economy but the real reward is getting your money's worth. Can't wait to go back.

If you don't like the red-hot on Naan fry bread you're either a vegetarian or a traitor to your country, and in either case we probably don't hang out very often. The cole slaw and BBQ dog is also TDF.  Short Leash's owners put together an impressive ensemble of local food truck vendors for the Downtown Mobile Food Court, open Fridays 11am-1pm in the Phoenix Public Market parking lot. Today's debut drew massive crowds and I expect the roster of food trucks to grow in the coming weeks.

I've read complaints about the service but my experiences, including a couple of stops during Lucky Strike's first week of operation, have all been four star-worthy. The only snafu I can recall is the back bar running out of clean pint glasses, which resulted in a completely benign wait.   Perhaps my expectations aren't as stringent as other reviewers but I've found the waitresses and bar staff to be both competent and charming. Really, there's so much going on around you, what with bowling, club music, sports and pretty folk everywhere, who notices if the food is coming out slowly?  Speaking of the food, the price of the lunch and bowl special, which includes a choice of two sliders, fries, and free game of bowling, recently rose from 5 to 9 bucks but that was to be expected, plus it's still a really good value. The sliders (beef, pork sausage, chicken or tuna) are no joke and the fries, which come in modern stainless cups, are always hot and flavorful. I can't speak to the small plates, salads or pizza but I'll bet the menu redefines the words "bowling alley food."  Quick Tips: 1) Make sure you get on their mailing list to receive the food and bowling coupons; and 2) If you're planning a large party--corporate outing, birthday, whatever--make sure you call and try to work a deal. In this economy everything is negotiable.

Today I had the club sandwich for lunch and it was without a doubt one of the top five sandwiches of my lifetime. A club sandwich seems easy enough to master but Lucky Strike threw an egg on top and change the game. Mind = Blown. Also, I had been a little underwhelmed by the service in visits past but today everything went nice and smooth. Your stock is rising, Lucky Strike!

Brick was the rookie restaurant in yesterday's Urban Wine Walk but you wouldn't have known it observing the staff's performance. They really seized an opportunity to make a great first impression by paying special attention to the Wine Walkers on hand to sample flights of wine and tasty slivers of pizza. Great job!

I generally keep my positive reviews in the four-star range, mostly because I hate setting people's expectations too high. It's a defensive mechanism I truly really believe in. Unfortunately, I can't give Vitamin T anything less than a five-star review. My lunch experience today was so over-the-top wonderful and the food was so freaking perfect not even cynical (and possibly silly) personal philosophies can make scale down my praise.  I mowed 3 carne asada tacos and walked away very full and beyond happy. The beef and vegetables were freshly prepared and the flour tortillas were big enough to act as sufficient vessels without overpowering my meat with their carbiness (it's a real word, look it up). The salsa bar (including sour cream) was stocked and kept clean. Special props for the pickled red peppers. So freaking great. Great job by Aaron May and Co. in capturing the spirit of street food without making the customer feel like they are eating food off the street.

Inhaled my first Jimmy John's sub this past Wednesday and not only did it taste great but the price point was lower than any sandwich in Downtown.   I opted for the tuna, added cheese for 75 cents and *still* escaped having paid about $5.50 for an 8-inch sandwich. Great value.  What I like best about Jimmy John's is the bread. Growing up in Minnesota my favorite sandwich shop was a place called Erbert and Gerbert's and Jimmy John's bread is almost an exact match. In fact, their subs are a perfect hybrid of E&G and Cousins.  Beyond the tasty sandwich I thought the staff was incredibly friendly and the music was surprisingly bangin'. Might have been Taylor Dayne on the stereo, I can't quite recall. Seating inside the shop is a little tight but if you head outside you can chill out with Five Guys Burgers & Fries patrons and enjoy the hustle and bustle of Washington Street.

I can't really add anything to the exceptional reviews 32 Shea has earned. I'll just say that I wish I lived closer so I could stop in more often. Integrity in service, great vibe and local. Keep doing what you're doing, guys.

I had the opportunity to take part in Arrogant Butcher's preview lunch and I was totally impressed with the restaurant's design and the staff's performance.   The service in particular was nothing short of spectacular, especially considering the size of the event and the Downtown notables in attendance (Mayor Gordon, City higher-ups, media).   I love the Butcher's view of US Airways Center and Chase Field and its vantage point will only improve if the city can just find a way to utilize that awful parking lot across from the basketball arena. With business reemerging in the warehouse district and baseball season fast approaching, things are definitely looking up for those blocks of Downtown.  Anyway, back to the Butcher. The entrees were well-received. I found my pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread to be way too salty, but I figure I made my own bed ordering cured meat on a pretzel. The crab cake salad, stew, jambalaya, roasted chicken and salmon plates all received enthusiastic thumbs up from our table and the desserts (cheesecake and chocolate cake cups) were delicious.  The bar is a huge square with heavy stone counters, plenty of seating and flatscreens, insuring that the Butcher will be a popular happy hour and pregame destination. There's also a wraparound patio.  Prices seemed friendly, too. I'm not a Fox RC devotee but could see myself becoming a regular at Arrogant Butcher.

Six months late, I finally had my first Film Bar experience last night and boy did it not disappoint.  First of all, there's something cool and instantly comforting in shaking the hand of the owner within 10 seconds of arrival. Film Bar is Kelly Aubey's brainchild and he deserves all the positive pub he's receiving for putting such an innovative entertainment concept in the heart of Downtown Phoenix.  Anyway, here's why I love Film Bar (in no particular order):  1. Beer. I like beer, and barkeep Joe did an excellent job designing a beer list that showcases local (San Tan/Prescott), regional (Stone IPA, my personal fave), and imports (some interesting German brews). There's wine too, which I admittedly know less than nothing about. My date liked the Riesling, if it's of any consequence.   2. Theater. The screening room is spacious yet intimate. Seats are comfortable and spaced nicely. I understand there's in-seat service but we didn't receive that attention. Not a big deal, as the run time of the film was only 83 minutes so we weren't getting the shakes or anything. For a longer movie I definitely think I'd be happy to have a server come around and offer me another beer. It also warrants mention that Film Bar is a 21+ theater. That means no babies. Holla.  3. Conversation. I think my favorite part of Film Bar is that it promotes post-film dialogue and fellowship. Instead of fleeing the Harkins in pairs to head to the Cheesecake Factory or some other crappy destination for overpriced food and bad service, at Film Bar you can grab another drink and talk to the people who just watched the movie with you. We stayed at the bar but there is a really inviting conversation area in back with comfy couches and romantic lighting. "You experienced Film Bar exactly how I want people to," a satisfied Kelly told us as the night was winding down.   4. Movies. OK, so last night's feminist art documentary, "Women Art Revolution" wasn't exactly a popcorn flick, but that's kinda the point. Film Bar brings in movies you wouldn't know about, much less see. The late show was a martial arts action flick called True Legend. And in August they'll be showing Some Days Are Better Than Others, a rom-commy film starring Carrie Brownstein (Sleater-Kinney, Portlandia) and James Mercer (The Shins, Broken Bells). I am RSVP'ing yes for that one.  5. Value. My date and I had a drink before the show, saw an educational and thought-provoking movie, and had two more drinks each post-show all for the whopping price of $35, which included a $5 rebate when you check-in on Yelp. Pretty sure you'd pay more to see Transformers 3, drink Coke Zero and eat chocolate-covered raisins. Checkmate, Film Bar.  6. Locale. It's Downtown, across from Just Breathe Wellness Sanctuary on 2nd St and Garfield, so if you do want to go somewhere else post-show you have some great options within walking distance (Breadfruit/Rum Bar, Moira, and even Carly's, The Roosevelt, etc.).  Can't wait to go back to Film Bar. Congratulations to Kelly for giving Downtown a much-needed cultural shot in the arm.

As a Downtowner, I'm attracted to businesses that offer experience and community as well as a good cup of coffee. City Central delivers on all three.  Damian, Danielle and the rest of the C3 crew bust their humps to make sure that every customer feels special and part of their java family. Their efforts have certainly paid off quickly, building an army of loyalists in just two short months. In addition to the standard menu of hot, cold and blended coffee drinks, City Central offers teas, sodas, pastries and a very  nice selection of grilled panini sandwiches. Damian has been a coffee pioneer in Downtown Phoenix since the mid-90s and his expertise is obvious. The atmosphere is superb. Free Wi-Fi, a nice selection of Pandora music playing throughout the tastefully decorated flat, newspapers and magazines for leisure reading, comfy seating, and a nice patio overlooking bustling Central Avenue. So next time you feel a gravitational pull toward the Evil Empire (cough, Starbucks), instead head over to Central Avenue and Washington for locally roasted coffee served by an on-site local proprietor who actually cares about his patrons.

Superb job by the Copper Blues staff during last night's grand opening. The crowd was asses to elbows but we never waited terribly long for snacks or drinks. When you consider it was a hosted bar and the girls probably weren't making a ton of money in tips their effort becomes even more admirable.  If you like a beer selection that runs 60+ deep, eclectic music, a killer patio with Downtown views, and wading in a sea of attractive people, odds are strong you'll have a good experience at Copper Blues. It really is a beautiful space with exposed ceilings, rich wood floors, gorgeous bars areas, and sumptuous attended bathrooms.  Aaron May's menu is still a bit of an unknown based on last night's samplers but it's hard to doubt the man responsible for so many restaurant successes (Vitamin T, Over Easy, Mabel's On Main, etc.). The big man was in attendance last night overseeing the finger food service, which included caprese on crackers (meh), meatballs (strong), tuna tartare (spicy and delicious) and sweet pea guacamole (five stars). I'm looking forward to getting busy with one of his entrees soon. Copper Blues is a big win for Downtown.

Crescent Ballroom is exactly what Downtown Phoenix needed: 1) A great music venue that attracts an eclectic mix of local, regional and national acts; 2) An Indoor/outdoor lounge, perfect for happy hours, dates, or weekend revelry; and 3) Tasty and affordable food and spirits. I bring people who don't ordinarily hang out Downtown to Crescent and they're blown away by the "cool factor." Charlie Levy did an amazing job creating the space and assembled a world-class staff.  If you're a first-timer make sure you try the Honey Badger (honey bourbon, ginger beer, lime, bitters), already the bar's star, and order a massive plate of nachos from the Cocina 10 kitchen. Crescent also has a nice selection of beers on tap that they rotate, including O'Dell IPA.

1) Plenty of soft serve options (standard vanilla and chocolate, plus rotating varieties like coconut, berry, mint, birthday cake, and snickerdoodle... there's even a vegan spigot)  2) Toppings galore--everything sweet and salty under the sun  3) Really comfortable space with outdoor seating  4) Super friendly and helpful staff (I picked up nine cups of deliciousness for a meeting and the girl behind the counter did everything in her power to expedite the process so I could deliver with minimal meltage  5) Great price! We got nine cups plus toppings and were out the door for 21 bucks.   Two spoons up!

I want to like this place, I really do, but today's New York Steamer was probably a Top 10 disappointing sandwich of my life. Soggy, lifeless, unimaginative, and overpriced.   I'd been to Firehouse one previous time, and the meatball was better. Far from spectacular, but much more satisfying than the corned beef/pastrami number I ordered during Visit #2. It was steamed meat, cheese and mayo on an old-tasting white hoagie. No veggies, no color, no texture, no good.  The Firehouse concept and story are cool. The employees are nice. The fountain drink vending machine is second to none. And I enjoy being able to watch college hoops while my sandwich gets steamed to death. But these pros cannot save an underwhelming experience that cost me $9. Subway's $5 Cold Cut Combo would have been a better investment.

Dan Majerle's new joint, located on the corner of 2nd Street and Washington next door to his flagship eatery, gave me a pleasant surprise today when I stopped in for some quick eats.  Expecting simply "eatable," I got way more.  You will not find better pizza (2 slices for $6) or lunch hour service (helpful, friendly, smiling, composed under duress) anywhere in Downtown. The combos include a drink and a nice little salad and there are a couple of flat screens tuned to ESPN. I took my slices to go but next time I'll gladly eat in.   The only criticism I can make is that the selection of pizzas was a little weak, but I had no problem waiting three minutes for the next piping hot pepperoni pie to spring from the oven.  Great job, Thunder Dan!

Maybe it was my mood, maybe it was the weather, or maybe eating a Chloe's Corner Pastrami & Swiss while enjoying the new Pop Up Park at CityScape was the best lunch experience I've had in 2+ years working Downtown. Let's start with Chloe's. The sandwich was very tasty but the service deserves separate mention. The staff, led by manager Lisa, is so nice and eager to assist customers that you wonder why other restaurants don't pay closer attention. Or at least spy on Chloe's to see how it's done.  We ended up taking our lunch (my friend had the Greek salad and tomato soup, also good) outside on the plaza, where DJ William Reed was playing everything from Snow Patrol and Hot Chip to Santagold, and the Downtown Ambassadors were letting folks shoot hoops, play cornhole, check-out books and magazines, and use a variety of board games. The Pop Up Park is a new concept and happens M-F from 11-1. William Reed and Sean Watson provide the music on Thursdays and Fridays.  You really need to experience this for yourself, especially now that the weather is idyllic. UPDATE: Whomever controls the music knows their business. This morning the place was rocking Smiths, Tragically Hip, and vintage REM. Perfect pairing with the formidable scent of eggs in the air.

The Mole Negro and Paella are both excellent and this time we tried some of the playful side dishes (sweet corn dusted with Mexican cheese and smoked paprika and some snow rolls that had egg noodles, shrimp and I believe yellow beets... both delicious). The best part about OTRO is that Mr. Robson could easily charge 25 percent more for his food but doesn't. Added bonus: On this Saturday we had a stellar soundtrack provided by the jazz three-piece What's the Big Idea, which played jazzy versions of contemporary rock songs from Weezer, Pink Floyd, Muse and Guns N Roses. Brilliant. OTRO has assumed the No. 1 position on my Phoenix Restaurants Power Rankings.

This is our new pre-Marquee spot. Well-curated beer selection, high-value and tasty menu, friendly service, welcoming environment and a surprisingly eclectic soundtrack---we heard everything from traditional alt rock to Justin Timberlake to my personal favorite, I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love Tonight by The Outfield.   Perhaps the highest praise I can give is in regard to the service. Because we were seated at the bar and could eavesdrop at will, we learned that our bartender/server was working just her third shift. Given her command of the menu and beer list, not to mention a highly engaging, don't sweat the small stuff attitude, you never would have guessed she was so green. Great job by everyone at Blasted Barley. We'll be back.
