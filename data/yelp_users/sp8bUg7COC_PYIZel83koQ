My husband and I went to Caffe Boa for the second time yesterday. The first time, we were waiting for our to-go sushi order from Sakana next door; so we thought we'd grab an appetizer and a glass of wine while we waited. Thought it was great and the atmosphere was great and figured we'd be coming back often.  Last night was different. The first words that we were greeted with were "Where do you want to sit?". Well, hello to you too! When we got to our table we were brought water, but it took about 20 min for someone to come greet us and get our drink order.  From this point, the experience was fine. We had a bottle of wine and the Crostini Boa (which the bread should be toasted). We ordered off of the specials for the night. I ordered the beef medallions and my husband had the filet. He ordered it rare, with specific instructions on how it should look. Our order was brought out and our server went back inside. My husband cut into his filet and it was overcooked; medium actually, and when you order it rare, that's REALLY overcooked. My meal was fine. We waited for the server to come back out to ask us how our meal was... and waited... and waited. After 20 min, he finally came back out and asked how everything was.  My husband is in the restaurant business and is well aware of how this next part should have gone. My husband told the server his steak was overdone (he only had a bite of it) and the server looked at the steak and said "Yup, that does look overdone. Would you like me to box it up for you?" What?! He should have said, "Yes, that does look overdone. I'm sorry about that, let me get you a new one."   When you're paying $40 for a filet entree, and spending almost $200 on a meal and experience, I expect them to get it right, or make it right. We had him box our leftovers and ordered another glass of wine and asked for the check. It was one of very few times that I tipped less than 20%.   We won't be going back.

Dog days has quickly become a favorite place for our dog Meatball. He LOVES it. I can barely keep him from jumping out the window of my car when we are pulling up.   The owner Megan was great about explaining everything they do there and gave me a tour the first time I stopped in. There are two sections, one for large dogs and one for small dogs. The employees play with the dogs all day and I can be sure that Meatball will come home tired from playing.  They have a 1/2 day rate ($15) and a full day ($30) rate. It may be a bit pricier than a few other places I looked at, but totally worth it. It's also right by my house, so that makes it that much better.  Meatball is still a puppy so we are still feeding him three times a day. I dropped him off one day and forgot to leave his lunch (bad mommy). When I returned a few hours later to drop it off, they had already fed him! That was AWESOME!   I trust the employees and am completely satisfied with the experience we've had so far.  I feel good about leaving him for our out-of-town trips. We will continue to be a loyal customer. Thanks Dog Days!

A year and a half later and I can't say enough great things about Dog Days. The staff is great and they are so good with my dog Meatball. He loves it there and I'd recommend it to anyone for when they are away or just to socialize their dog. Amazing place!!!

I just moved from Colorado and needed to find a place that carried Jane Iredale makeup. The staff wasn't just friendly, but very knowledgable about the product. I will keep going back!

I just moved to Phoenix and was looking for a gym. I saw a Living Social deal for Kosama and decided to try it. I've only been going for 2 weeks now, but it's been the best workout I've had. The class times are flexible so you can go at any time that fits into your schedule. The instructors are great at making you feel welcome and pushing you to work hard. It sometimes feels like you have a personal trainer, rather than a group class. I recommend Kosama to anyone who is looking for a workout that will push your limits.

My husband, father in law and I went to Milagros grill for my husband's birthday. All I can really say is DELICIOUS!!! I had the papa y carne flatbread and it's one of the best meals I've had... ever. My husband had the surf and turf and my father in law had the short ribs. Everything was delicious. The atmosphere was great. I was so happy that we chose to go there. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the service could have been a bit better. We will definitely be back!

Love this place! Jenny is fantastic! Even though she was running late she stayed and gave me my pedicure even though it's after hours. I recommend this place to anyone that wants great service and a great mani/pedi!
