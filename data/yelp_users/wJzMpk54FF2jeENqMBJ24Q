The inside seating is limited and can get crowded during peak times.  Might need to do some shuffling around to get out if you're in the corner.    The lunch special (11am-2pm) here is really cheap.  You get two cheese pizza slices and a drink for $3.00 + tax.  It's additional if you want to add toppings.

My coworkers and I always have a hard time deciding what to do for lunch.  One day, my coworker Mike suggested this place since we were in the mood for Mexican food.  He said the food is really good and he's been going there regularly for years.  After leaving that visit and going there multiple times, this is by far my favorite Mexican Restaurant in the Valley.  We always start off with some chips and salsa.  Make sure you try the sauce from the squeeze bottle.  It's so good that you end up eating so much chips and leaves you with little room to finish your meal.  If you want more appetizers, I would recommend the cheese crisps with peppers!  And if you like horchata, This place gives free refills :)  My favorite item from the menu is the green corn tamale with green sauce!  It's a must have when I come here.  I would usually pair it up with a bean and cheese burro.  If you have a really big appetite, go with one of the combo plates.  You will leave full with one of those plates.   The staff here are really friendly and welcoming.  You'll see them chatting it up and laughing with the many regulars that come in.  Food comes out fairly quick even during the lunchtime rush.

The service here is on point.  The waiter that served us was really nice and friendly.    No complaints on the food.  It was DELICIOUS!!

I'd like to thank the first reviewer Korina for sharing that they have cheap dry ice here.  I was looking for some dry ice to make some fog for Halloween.  They sell it for $0.40/lbs and each bag is about 5lbs.  They do sell a lot of junk food and ice cream for a very low price.  You can come here and stock up on your favorite goodies.    When trying to find the place, I believe the name on the building is Big Boy...

I think this is the #1 PHO RESTAURANT IN PHOENIX in my opinion.  I come here at least 3 times a month (more if my coworker persuades me to go get some pho) and always leave satisfied.    The price and portion is great!! A variety of pho ranging from $4.75 - $6/7.  If you're really hungry, you can ask for a large.    My typical order is #1 with meatballs, spring rolls, and a thai tea.  That comes out to about $10.

Definitely a go to place when you're in Vegas and want AYCE Sushi.    Let me start off with the place.  It's a pretty small location and with the amount of interest, this place gets packed and wait times can range from 10 min to 90 min+.  On our last trip there, we had a party of six and what disturbed us the most was that seating was not on a first come first served basis for larger groups.  You would expect the staff to hold tables that are next to each other and almost nearly closing out to fit a larger group but that was not the case.  Groups of four was being seated before us and we had to wait for a larger table that would normally fit six.  We had to wait almost 90+ minutes before we got a table.  My recommendation is to get there before they open which I believe is 11am or after 2pm when it starts to die down.    The food there is awesome!  Nothing to complain about.  Try anything that catches your eye.  My top picks are the white tuna, garlic ahi, ama ebi, unagi, masago w/ qual eggs, calamari, shrimp tempura, etc.    It looks like they opened another location so we'll most likely try that place out when we're back in town.

Great Vietnamese sandwiches for a good price.  Get one of their boba drinks and you  got yourself a meal for a really cheap price.    Just remember they only accept CASH!

Always wanted to try Brazilian BBQ.  The price was good, cheaper than Fogo de Chao.  The meat here was very tasty.  No complaints.

How hard is it to be polite? If you don't like your job, why work here? Dude took his time ringing up the customer in front of us while there were 3 other customers in the back of us. We asked a question and got a loud  "what!!??!?!" in return. His arrogant face was threw me over the edge!

The wife found this place on Yelp one day we were craving BOBA so we decided to try it out especially after looking through some of the photos people have shared.    Once we walked through the door, the first thing we said was "WOW" because of how the store is decorated with customers writings/drawings.  We thought it was pretty cool.    The first time we went I got the diamond ice which was BOMB!! and the wife got the milk tea with boba. She was very happy to get her milk tea blended (unlike Lollicup where you can't get it blended).  On our second trip I tried the avocado smoothie (substituted for soy milk which you can do for all drinks) along with mango jelly!! The one thing I love about their avocado smoothie is that they use real fruit which makes it taste 10 times better.    Even with summer ending, GO AND GET SOME BOBA!!

I've been cutting my hair here for more than a year already every two weeks.  I was a bit skeptical about going here to get a fade but ended up with a pretty good hair cut for cheap.    My usual haircut is a 3 at the top and 0 on the sides with a medium high fade.  Two barbers I highly suggest you go to that does an awesome job is Maria and Malorie.   If you end up going to this place a lot or any other Great Clips, Take advantage of the current special which is buying pre-paid haircuts for $9.99.  They recently raised their regular hair cuts from $12 to $13 not too long ago.

The food was really good here.  I got the 3 item combo (meat jun, kalbi, and spicy chicken).  We dined in so we had a combo of sides that they have up front.  They had no problem with refilling any of the sides if you ask.   The service was good.  The waiter checked up on us enough and made sure our cups were filled with water.

Anytime the wife and I crave for a good comforting breakfast, we always end up here.  When we go on the weekends right before noon, the place is usually busy.  With being only a party of two, we normally get seated pretty quickly.    The staff here are always very friendly and on top of their game.  Never had bad service during the times we've went.    The food is always good.  The wifes favorite is the roast beef dinner which is a MUST try!!  I like ordering from their breakfast menu.  The country fried steak breakfast is delicious!!

One of the spot my coworkers and I go to for lunch. We usually try to get there before 11am (weekdays) to beat the rush from all the Corporate places near the MetroCenter.    The deli sandwiches are good.  I usually stick to getting the Amy's turkey-O.  If you plan on substituting a side, make sure you tell them because the cashiers don't normally ask and you'll be stuck with chips.  The salad bar here is very decent for the price.    Don't forget to get ice cream on the way out!

THIS REVIEW IS TOTALLY BASED ON HOW THIS STORE DOES SHOE RELEASES.    It's a first come first serve basis which sounds like if you get there early you have a real good chance  of getting the shoe.  That is partially true after experiencing it first hand camping out for the Jordan 11 playoffs.  The better way to describe it is.. who ever is the first 5 in line will get a shoe along with all their homies that they let cut.  There is no security guard or employee regulating the line.  Even when people from the back would tell the cutters to get to the back, they come up with some excuse saying that they've been there for a long time already or their spot was being saved.  It is pretty obvious and unfair after you see groups of people jump in front of you after you've been waiting for hours.    This shoe store is not your Footlocker, Finish Line, Nike store, or Champs. They won't receive close to the amount the bigger shoe store will get.  I think they only had maybe 15 (or less) Jordan 11's today.  When we first got there, there was less than 20 people in front of us.  30 minutes before they opened the door, there was maybe 30-40 in front of us.    That will be my last time camping out for a shoe here.  Your odds are better of dealing with the raffles or purchasing the shoes online when they release.

Been going here for a while now.  I think my fiance and I are battling it out for the Duke/ Dutchess crown for check-ins.    The times we usually dine here are during happy hour/ reverse happy hour because the menu has a wide selection of some of their popular sushi rolls to their appetizer.  The prices are great for their happy hour menu.  I did notice when we went there last night that they raised some of the prices on the happy hour menu.  We would normally order off the happy hour menu but decided to try something different.  We tried two rolls from the wall menu and now it has become our favorite rolls.  My fiance got the triple S and I got the Scott Snowbird.  (Look at the north wall menu when you're in there)  Service is always great when we go, whether it's with a party of 2 or a party of 15 people.  The waiters there are always on top of it.

We've been going here a few times and were craving Thai food after being on vacay for a month.  We head to the place and noticed all the chairs were up.   This location is now closed!  They have a sign saying they have moved but there is no address to where they have moved yet.   The food here was good.  The price/size/quality made us coming back for more.  Very sad to see this place closed down but would love to know where they have moved to.

I walked in and was the only customer in the store (early morning). No one was near the front area. As an employee walked towards the register, I did not receive any greeting or "what would you like to order?". As she just stared at me, I told her what I wanted.  After I had paid for it, she hands me my card without saying anything.  I would assume her response should have been "Thank you, you're order will be up shortly".  As my order was being made by another person, the female that helped me out at the registered went to go chat it up with her co-worker as she slouched on the wall not wanting to do anything.  This review is based on their customer service.  I really like the smoothies at TSC but I have not experienced this type of service at any of the other locations.  (This was during a visit sometime in early October)

This is the only Rock Climbing gym I've been to so my review might be a bit biased.    The gym itself is very nice.  A bunch of walls with all kinds of paths to take.  I usually grab on to whatever rock I can reach.  The next time I go I will try sticking to paths.  They recently created a bouldering wall on the second level but that is only available to members.  They do have a small bouldering section in the back corner that is available to everyone.  A lot of the walls/ climbs require two people.  One person that is climbing and the other is belaying.  If you go in by yourself, you're kind of limited to the auto-belay climbs (I believe there are 4) and the bouldering section.    The overall price for rental and day pass is around $17-20.  If you do plan on going there more than twice in a month, I highly suggest you sign up for their membership which is $35 and you can go as many times you want through out the month.  Plus you get access to the upstairs bouldering room.

This is the best Filipino Restaurant in Phoenix!  The restaurant is nice and always clean.  The staff there are friendly.  The food is reasonably priced.    They offer a lot of variety each day.  I believe they offer around 15+ entree options and that's not including their silog menu.  My fiance and I usually get a two choice with a boba drink and that usually comes out less than $20.  If we're really hungry we get a halo halo supreme to finish our meal.

We were craving for an Acai bowl so what did we do?  We searched "Acai Bowl" on Yelp for the nearest location.  The pictures looked good so we decided to give this place a shot.    This location is right next to the movie theaters (south side).    The Acai bowl was delicious and filling.  I believe it was around $6-7.  IMO, the acai bowl is better here than at Jamba juice.

Need to sit at the bar to receive happy hour specials. Rolls are small and priced high.  Haven't tried other items on the menu but I won't be going back to this place for sushi.

Here's my bad experience with Carpet World:  I called to get a quote on a carpet repair I needed in my master bedroom.  I spoke to a guy named Jogi that was very knowledgeable on the phone.  He was able to schedule me in the next morning (8am) for someone to come out and give me an estimate on the job I needed done.    8am the next morning, No one had shown up so I called at 8:15 and spoke to Jogi.  Jogi had told me that he did not confirm with the person  scheduled to do my estimate and said that he is probably sleeping.  Jogi told me that he would give him a call and give me a call back.  After waiting for 2 hours, no one has shown up nor did I receive a call back from Jogi.  I gave him a call and Jogi immediately told me he will give his guy a call and call me back.  Another hour goes by and still no word from Jogi.  I gave him one last call and he didn't even bother picking up the phone.    UNPROFESSIONAL AND WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! Didn't even bother to call me and let me know they could not come in that day.  Luckily we found someone else to fix our carpet that day and he did a really good job.  Once I find his contact info, I'll share it here.

Had to find a new place to cut my hair after moving from the West side to the Tempe area.  Saw Crisp Cutz on Yelp and decided to give it a shot.   The shop is in a small market area along the main road.  The interior is nice and welcoming.  The waiting seats are lined up on a wall right across from the two barber seats.  They have TV's on the walls that was playing ESPN.    This place is manned by two babers, Sean and Polo that have a good customer base.  When I went in, I believe there was maybe around 4 regulars getting their haircut.  I got my hair cut by Polo.  He's a really nice guy and really good at what he does.    The only downfall I have about this place is the wait time.  With 4 people in front of me, it took around 2+ hours before I could get in that barber seat.  I would recommend calling in ahead of time to see what the wait is like before going in.    Overall it was a great place.

Called these guys up on a Friday and was able to get an appointment on Sunday.  Joel and Juan were very nice and did a very good job at cleaning our carpet (hope we get our rental deposit back).  Comparing Sweet Touch with this other company we went with a while back after seeing a coupon in the weekly ads, Sweet Touch did a better job 10 times better.    Their prices are affordable and don't hide any extra fees from you.  What they quote you is what you pay.    Thanks SweetTouch!     HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Just wanted to give MAJOR PROPS to the Portillo's Staff on their Grand Opening!  They did an amazing job to make sure things ran efficient and people got their food.  It was a bright move for the Management to not let people reserve seats until they got their food.  By doing so, it allowed everyone to have a chance to find an open seat and enjoy their meal.    The turnout for this Grand Opening was unreal.  The line was long and continued to grow throughout the night.  I got in line at around 5pm with maybe 100+ people in front of me.  My wife joined me in line 15 minutes later and I only moved maybe 20 ft.  It took about 1 hour 30 min to get our food but we had no complaints.  The line moved fairly quickly for the amount of people that were there.  There was a good control of the line, didn't notice anyone cutting or anything.    Now onto the reason why we went there.  Since it was our first time at Portillo's, the wife and I decided to try out a few things.  We got the Hot Dog with everything on it, the Jumbo Chili Cheese Dog, Italian Beef with sweet peppers and mozarella cheese, large fries, and a Large Chocolate Cake Shake.  Everything was delicious!!  Between the two hot dogs, I enjoyed the regular hot dog with everything on it instead.  The Italian beef was amazing. I will ask for gravy on the side the next time I go so I can dip my sandwich in it.  The chocolate cake shake was like heaven in your mouth.  It was that good.  I think getting a large of that is just too much sweets for even two people.  I would get a smaller size the next time.  It was a great experience to be there on the Grand Opening day.  We will definitely be going back on our cheat days!

This is a very nice sports complex.    The sports complex has the following:  Fenced-in amenities: - Four Full Basketball Courts - Volleyball Courts - Sand Volleyball Courts - Tennis Courts - Racquetball Courts - Baseball/Softball Fields  Non-Fenced-in amenities : - playground - soccer fields (only for league play) - Rubber track (opposite side of canal)  The place is very well kept.  I rarely see any trash laying around.  The only things I use is the basketball courts and the track.  The track is located on the opposite side of the canal.  If you plan on only using the track, there is parking located on 23rd ave and Peoria.  Restrooms are located next to the track as well.  The track is made out of rubber and is good in my opinion.  There are some patches that needs to be fixed but it won't affect your run at all.   There are four full-court basketball courts.  Some areas of the courts have a few cracks and chips.  The level of the court is slanted in some areas as well.  Even with those minor things, all of the four basketball courts are fully operable.    This sports complex used to charge a membership fee but they did away with that.  I may be wrong but I think only members are able to rent out rackets, balls, etc.

I'll start off with saying this was the Best Experience renting a car before.  In the past week we had a couple of family members come in from out of state and had to rent cars for weekend trips so we got to experience a few different vendors.  First vendor was with Alamo which was good.  Then had a rental with Payless which I will never go with them again. (I'll be writing a review shortly). Then we rented with Enterprise.    I was looking for a cheap compact rental for this past weekend.  I saw that Payless was cheap but did not want to rent from them again because of the quality of the rental.  I noticed Enterprise rate was the same so I decided to go with them.  I walked in and was greeted by Matt at the entrance of their storefront.  This dude is entertaining and makes the whole rental process fun.  He was very helpful and made sure all my needs were met.    After finalizing paperwork, I headed down to the car lot and was greeted by Cory to go pick out a car.  I like the ability to choose different models of cars within your rental category.  You know that time of renting a car when you have to inspect the vehicle and you or the vendor does not have a pen for you to mark the dings and scractches.  Well, the person assisting you at the car lot carries a digital tablet and will make the notations there.  I thought that was very neat.  The quality of the cars are new and clean.  Overall experience, the rental process was perfect.  If Enterprise is in your budget, I would highly suggest going with them.   *All my rentals above was from the PHX Sky Harbor Car rental locations.

When our friend posted a pic on instagram, we thought he was in Vegas.  Read the comments and was excited to see that the location was in Phoenix!  After reading that, my wife and I looked at each other and said "LET'S GO!!"  We went a couple of days after they did their soft opening.  It was nice to see that there was no lines to wait in since we know it won't be like that for long.  The staff had high energy and very welcoming.  The service was on point with regular check ups and water refills.   The food was delicious like always.  We (party of 3) ordered  2 lbs of shrimp, garlic butter, mild (spicier that usual) with bowls of rice.  My wife and I usually share 1 lbs of shrimp and we leave full.  I'm looking forward to trying new item on the menu now that we have a location here.

We were looking for a new boba place to try out and stumbled upon Glacier Snow. I had my mind set on getting a mango boba before walking in. Once I saw that they had Halo-Halo, I automatically changed my mind. The Halo-Halo was delicious! I would definitely get it again. The place is spacious and clean. The staff was friendly and welcoming.  This would be a great spot to hang out and chill with friends.
