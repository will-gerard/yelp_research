This is probably the best Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix, especially if you are a red chile lover. Love the micheladas too. My only complaints would be the lengthy wait times to be sat on the weekends and the lack of a chunky salsa.

I had been wanting to try this place since it is near by me. I saw a lot of hit or miss reviews. Well I had a miss. Between my girlfriend and I we ordered the pot roast and father's cut prime rib. The pot roast had a flavor that was unusual, and not in a good way. The prime rib was a nice cut but dry and flavorless. The salad bar is mediocre with basic items that were at least fresh. The steak and vegetable soup also had a strange not good taste I was thoroughly disappointed. The only reason I give this place 2 stars rather than 1 is for the complimentary fresh baked wheat bread. It was pretty good with butter. They also sell the bread by the loaf.

The first time I ate here I didn't have a memorable experience because the food was not bad but there are so many good taco shops and Mexican food restaurants in central Phoenix that are less expensive. I did, however, decide to book my girlfriend's birthday dinner here because she love's taco's and the ambiance is better than a taco truck. (No offense to Charlie's) Also, the restaurant is located near our final destination for the evening. We showed up 15min early for our reservation but a few people in the party had not arrived. We were told by the hostess that our entire party needed to be there before we could be sat. We decided to order drinks in the bar and sip them near the pool. After we had ordered 3 rounds of drinks the hostess came out to tell us she gave our table away because she couldn't find us. We were all in shock because we had been walking past the hostess stand all night to order drinks. They could not have tried very hard to look for us. We asked to speak to the manager. Instead of being apologetic he came at us with an attitude as if the whole incident were our fault. We told him we couldn't believe the way he was treating us and we would not be back. To that he responded "fine you can leave!" Two minutes later he came back and offered to cover our bar tab and get us another table. At that point half the party was already outside. It was too little too late. Not sure why the manager (who also claimed to be the restaurant owner) would not come to us apologetic from the start. He has a lot to learn about managing a restaurant and treating customers with respect. They should think about investing in pagers since they have trouble locating guests who have all ready checked in for a reservation!

One of the few Italian restaurants in the valley that make fresh pasta. Food is great but because of the large open windows in the bar sometimes there are flies inside.

Best carne asada in town, hands down. Salsa bar is always fresh and well stocked. Restaurant is always clean and service is fast.

Very inconvenient in terms of parking. This is inside Christown Spectrum adjoined to the Walmart. You will pay anywhere from $5 to $20 in convenience fees for each service, not sure it's actually worth it.

The tuna poke is excellent! I haven't had anything from the menu that wasn't good. They also make a great white sangria.
