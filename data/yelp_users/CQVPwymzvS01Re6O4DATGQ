Went to Fate while roaming around at First Friday.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect because of the mixed reviews. But, my experience was very positive and pleasant.   We got there early and put our name on the list. The staff was very nice about keeping us updated on where we were.  Once we were seated (inside) the server was nice and attentive. No discernable 'tude.  Love the space BTW...very tiny but very cool with the exposed brick and rafters....and dark....also...I would really like it if restaurants lit with candles would print their menus in a larger than 3 pt. font.  Or maybe I could just break down and buy some reading glasses. :)  We got the spring rolls as an app. They were good but a little odd (austere..ha)...they were filled entirely with celophane noodles (they may call them something else) with basil leaves rolled in with the wrapper.  They were served with a spicy sauce that complimented them nicely.   OK...sooo...I don' t really remember exactly what our entrees were called (please refer to top paragraph). But we had shrimp and chicken dishes. Mine was spicy chicken, hers was shrimp and wasn't.  Both were quite good.  I would definitely eat here again.

I LOVE this place! You can keep your corporate cookie cutter sub shops. Give me one that is family owned and recognize you when you come in!

The other night was the first time that I had been to Zen 32. We had a big group had to go with outside tables as there was not enough room inside. But...they had a bunch of heaters outside so it was pretty comfortable.   The staff was amazing. They were all very, very friendly and did everything they could to make our dinner a perfect.   The food was very good. They start with a little cucumber and onion salad with vinegar and sugar. Quite tasty. Happy hour till 6:30, with some nice selections. My sisters and daughter don't do sashimi so I didn't have any tonight, but it got high marks from other diners. We the special shrimp roll, which was a standout along with a tootsie roll and a couple of others. The happy hour prices are very good though the rolls on the happy hour menu are pretty basic. Would definitely go there again.

Have read a lot of reviews but have never been here prior to tonight. Not sure about the reviews regarding poor service. It's not McDonald's folks...this place is not meant to get you in and out in 45 minutes. If you want your food quick...call it in and get it to take-out. Take your time and enjoy the amazing food, affordable wine, and great space.  I was there with my wife and sister, and we ordered 8 different bruschettas, a sandwich, and a salad. They were all hits...no misses. Our service was quick, friendly, helpful and attentive. Giving us advice like recommending that we buy the bottle instead of three glasses of the same wine cause we get a free glass! Woohoo! :)  Will definitely be going back, and very happy that I finally went!

These folks were called via my home warranty company. Had a bad experience with Sears awhile back and was glad someone else was called.  They worked with me on the time. They came over. The guy was nice. Garage door fixed!  I would be happy to use them again!

Located off of Elliot and I-10, Sakana is the place to go for fresh, inventive sushi.      Fresh, fresh, fresh! That is the name of the game here.  For starters try their spring rolls, crunchy and delicious! Their sashimi melts in your mouth. Like budda, baby. I normally get salmon and yellowtail. Good stuff.  I have never had a roll here that I didn't like. If it looks like it will be good when you order it...it'll be even better on the plate.  Try 'em all.      After 6:00 or so on the weekends, look for hour waits. But it will be worth it.   The combination of taste, value, and unassuming atmosphere is hard to duplicate here in the valley.

If you have Cracker Barrel, or Claim Jumper listed as your favorite restaurants, McGrath's is right up your alley! Honestly, the restaurant is nice, the wait staff was fine, the food was edible. But it's corporate food.....plain and simple.    Have a Claim Jumper clone Cobb Salad, a forgettable stuffed flounder.  Boring.    Conclusion: Save McGrath's for that business lunch where you don't want to offend anyone. But don't look for any kudos regarding your creativity....take them to the San Diego Bay Restaurant in Guadalupe instead. And watch those bonuses just keep on comin'!

You know how hard it is to find good sushi in Mesa...right? I like Temari,  but sometimes want a change without having to drive to Scottsdale, or, heaven forbid, suffer the indignity of eating a "krab" roll at one of the many "bigbox" china buffets in the area.  :-)    I just found out Sekai Sushi existed the other day...tucked away next to JoAnn Fabrics adjacent to Target.  So, I stopped in for a couple of maki rolls for lunch a few days ago.  The price was right and the taste was there too, so I went back last night to see how their sashimi and more adventurous rolls are.   First off, if you Google Sekai Sushi you can find some reviews that bash this place on a couple of different fronts. Most point to poor (and unfriendly) service and decor.  I did not find that to be the case at all. We were greeted with a friendly hello and big smiles from the host and the sushi chef (dude? guy?).  The decor is also just fine. No it's not Stingray or Ra, but it is tastefully decorated and clean. It also isn't cramped like Sekana or Temari, which is nice.  Started off with salmon sashimi. It was excellent.  Very fresh, clean, buttery taste, and it melted in my mouth. Some of the best quality I have found in the Phoenix area.  Next stop was a Las Vegas roll, along with shrimp tempura roll.  The flavors were there, but the construction was a little lacking as they weren't as tight as they should have been.  Next time I will order more traditional rolls as I saw some go out that looked very well constructed.  I finally tried some nagiri because I felt I must....ha.   I had the hamachi (yellowtail) and I have to say, that it was the best I have ever had.  Supremely fresh, with a velvety (sp?) texture that made my eyes roll back in my head. Good stuff.   I then ended the meal with some green tea ice cream that was better than average.  Soooo....my final thoughts.  I will be going back to Sekai Sushi.  The quality of the food along with the price make this a very attractive sushi option in Mesa.  Regarding the price....the dinner I described above along with two large Asahi's....under $40.  You can't beat that with a stick.

C-Fu has been rated the #1 Chinese restaurant in the Valley many times. It's menu is HUGE!  Amazing seafood here also.  Very fresh, very delicious!    One of the things I like about C-Fu is that there is a list of sauces and preparations and you decide what you want with it.  You want shrimp, tofu , and scallop Kung Pao? No problem. The combinations are endless.  Best dim sum around also. Lots of carts going around with lots of fresh items.  I went there with a couple of guys from Hong Kong, and they said it was some of the best dim sum they had had in the U.S.  One thing I did notice is that the REALLY obscure and odd stuff (deep fried chicken feet, tripe) comes around early in the service, and the more mainstream items (ribs, egg rolls) tend to come out after 11:30 or so.  Don't know if it's intentional, but it seems to be a trend.  Yes, it's loud and raucous, but from what I was told by the Hong Kong dudes, that's the way it is over there.  If you are looking for an austere Sunday brunch, C-Fu is not the place to go.

I think I've been to Ninja about 10 times. What makes me keep coming back is the freshness of their fish. Why did I give it 4 stars instead of five? Because of a couple of things. The wait staff sometimes appears to forget that you are there. So order all your rolls at once! LOL  The rolls also at times could be tighter. Fall apart at times. They taste great, but I'm not enamored with having to eat my sushi in little pieces.     OK, so that's the bad stuff. The good stuff? Ninja is a very casual sushi joint that I can go to and take my daughter or a casual date.  The sushi is delicious. Their sashimi is fresh, and their rolls, while not groundbreaking, never fail to satisfy.     Another nice, added bonus is the Benihana-like back room. If you're into to that salt and pepper swingin', spatula slappin' stuff. :)  Disclaimer! I have no idea if the back room serves any edible food. Haven't eaten there, but it does seem fairly busy.    So try Ninja, I think you'll like it as a change of pace. Especially on Friday and Saturday where the waits are much shorter than at top tier sushi joints.

Have been to Cyclo twice. Both times the food was very good.  Ate both times in the late afternoon. Good service...an unanimated, but effiicient staff.   Start with the pork and shrimp spring rolls, move on to the crisp lemongrass chicken or pad thai, end it with one of their unique desserts...and you have a meal that is sure to satisfy!   Beware the plum soda! LOL That's all I have to say about that...

CHEAP EATS ALERT! On your way to the Chandler Mall for lunch? Why don't you skip the corporate food for a day and stop by Espo's (Espinoza's)? Located on the SE corner of Chandler and McClintock, Espo's Market has been anchored at this spot for decades.   Simple but hearty fare here. Personally, I go for the rellenos almost every time. But the tacos and burros are rock solid also.   Careful you don't get any sauce on that tie Scooter!

I don't usually go out for sandwiches, as in most cases I come home underwhelmed....muttering that I could have made a better sandwich myself. Flancer's was recommended to me one day by a co-worker who's taste buds I respect. I forgot about until I saw a Groupon for them. So I said "What the heck". Am I ever glad that I did!  The space is very casual, yet not a dump. The wait staff were very friendly, attentive and courteous. But it is the food my friends that will hook you.   We started with the Green Chile Mushroom Phyllos. Absolutely delicious. You have to try them. My wife and I split the Prickly Pear Chicken sandwich and the "We Must Meat, And I Ain't Lion" filet sandwich. For sides we got the Jalapeño & Cheddar Mashed Potato Pie & Green Chile Mac & Cheese as the sides. I gotta say....they were fantastic! The flavors for both sandwiches are well thought out, but the bread they bake on site put them over the top. It is the perfect combination of softness and chew. I am still thinking about it. The mash potato pie and mac and cheese are also must haves. We are looking forward to more visits and making our way through the menu!

CHEAP EATS ALERT! I love the menu here...tacos, cheese crisps, and burros.  Everything is made fresh, tastes great, and is inexpensive!  The fish tacos are standouts here along with the burros. Grab yourself some fresh salsa, plop down on a folding chair with your Negra Modelo, and try not to splash anything on your neighbor!  :-)

Opened by a former part-owner of Richardson's, Carlsbad Tavern is one place in the valley I keep coming back to.  It used to be on the corner of Scottsdale Road and Osborne...moving to Hayden (just south of Osborne) about 6 years ago.   With inventive New Mexican entrees, Carlsbad Tavern provides both great atmosphere and eats!   It's steaks, ribs, and burgers are grilled over pecan wood, adding a smokiness that's a nice alternative to hickory or mesquite. It's carne adovada rivals both Richardson's and Los Dos Molinos (though less spicy than Los Dos.) Start off with the Tequila shrimp, served with cilantro pesto black beans (to die for!) Chicken tortilla soup also rocks my world...Chili rellenos are among the best I've had in Phoenix. Ribs are way up there also. The sauce is unique, flavorful, and works perfectly with the meat. Don't forget the corn muffins with cactus butter!   Well stocked bar with a friendly competent staff. They also have one of the funnier menus around called..."The Daily Guano"  Much more seating here than Richardson's. What really sets it apart is the tables outside. All heated, for comfort any time of year. Add to that a creek and a fireplace...and you get a restaurant that works for lunch after golf or a on date.

Forget the corporate seafood restaurants. Spend an hour or so in Mexico, and eat some amazing food!     Located at what ostensibly is the SE corner of Guadalupe and Priest, the San Diego Bay Restaurant is easy to miss...or disregard at first glance.  From the street it looks like just another Guadalupe market.  Then you go around to the lot and try to squeeze in between a BMW and a Mercedes. What do they know that you don't? That the San Diego Bay (named the best authentic Mexican restaurant by the New Times 2005) serves some of the best south of the border seafood around!    Forget ambience...here the food is the star. The whole red snapper, and the grilled seafood assortment are very, very good. But what trips my trigger? The shrimp diablo holds the key to my heart. Shrimp in sour cream, jalepenos, with garlic and onions. Kicks like a mule with velvet horseshoes. Oh so good. My sister orders the version without the heat...called camarones verdes.      Do yourself a favor. Take a trip to Guad....and keep those Negra Modelos coming!

I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. It's simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Can't be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!

Have only eaten here once, but man...it was incredible!  Perfect for a romantic evening or with family and friends. Wait staff attentive, personable, and efficient.   Olive oil to die for with the bread, amazing wine selection, mouth watering food. Daniel's has it all! I had a grilled veal chop, with an arrugula salad. Washed it down with a chianti reserve. Ended with a classic tirimisou and coffee. Perfect!  Want to try something new? Want to try someplace that impresses without even trying? Daniel's is it.

Get some Chippewa Indian barbeque....Minnesota style!  Famous Dave's started in Minnesota. I've been told that Dave is a Chippewa Indian...may sound a little odd...but he cooks up some very good barbeque!  Three restaurants have opened in Arizona in the past year or so.  Famous Dave's was a staple of my diet back when I was sufferin' in Minne-snow-ta. The chicken is OK, pulled pork and beef brisket better. But what pulled me in were their St. Louis style ribs. Baby backs are good, but I just kind of dig spare ribs more. Don't know why...I just do. Famous Dave's does a pretty fair job with theirs.  Nice and meaty,  and grilled so that there's a little char on them. The meat falls off the bone just like it should. If I have any complaint with them it's that they slather it with their regular sauce. I really like their Texas Pit better.   So if you're in the area, give them a try. Starting to get a little corporate, but don't let that stop you.  It's good solid "Q" that rivals most in the Valley.   P.S. Skip the frozen corn as a side...ask for extra beans! :)

I actually found this while trying to find the now defunct Maggie Moos on Warner near Val Vista.  During my quest I found this little place.  I thought that it was a cute little place.  The yogurt is pretty good.  I had the Heath bar with Heath bar topping.  I think that the vanilla yogurt my friend had was better. My daughter got boysenberry, and it was pretty good too. The topping selection was OK.  Wishing that they had more fresh fruit topping selections. All in all, a nice little place that I think that I'd go to again.

I had heard good things of the Gilbert House from a friend of mine and decided to go today.  One thing I want to make clear...if you are going on a Sunday morning. Get there early!  It is small and their are only about 10 or 12 tables total. But...I did, so it wasn't an issue. The only thing I would recommend is try to get a table that isn't next to the door as ever person in line seems to feel the need to peer in every 3 minutes. Sort of annoying.  I went for breakfast, though they do serve lunch and dinner also. Wine and beer is available.  The staff is extremely friendly. Our waitress was much friendlier than I have ever been that early in the morning, and I consider myself a morning person!  The service was very quick and efficient, I am sure because this place must depend on lots of turns!  The coffee comes in "cute" cups (my friend's words, not mine..LOL), but the coffee in them was very good. I had the spicy chorizo omelet, and my friend had the vegetarian omelet . Both were delicious with very fresh ingredients.  The chorizo actually had a little kick to it, which a nice surprise. Hash browns were well prepared also. Honestly, if I were being hypercritical, the only fault that I could find is that the packaged tortilla that came with my breakfast would have benefited immensely by a quick toss in a pan to heat it up.  But I am won't be and so won't mention it. Ha.  Soooo, if you are in the Gilbert area some morning, give the Gilbert House a try.  I think that you will be glad that you did!

Aunt Chilada's at the Pointe is more about atmosphere than food.  It has a good happy hour, but the food is pretty pedestrian.  I was forced to edit and downgrade my rating because of my most recent visit.  Though the service was quite good, the food was horrific.   Was there again recently with some folks from work. It was chosen since it was close to the hotel our corporate visitors were staying. I decided to forgo the usual safe burro and try the chile relleno and the spinach enchilada. O...M...G...what a mistake.  The spinach enchilada consisted of a limp tortilla filled with frozen spinach and covered in a sauce that if it wasn't from a can was seasoned with tin...ha...ha. The relleno was stuffed with queso, breaded, deepfried, covered with the same tin flavored sauce, which in turn was then covered again with rubbery white cheese. Oh boy!  What a treat!  After this meal I have made a vow to never to stray from a burro here again.   So, if you plan on getting together with a big group for Happy Hour, Aunt Chilada's is an OK choice.  If you are looking for truly top flight Mexican food, there are other places that may be more appropriate.

My daughter loves this place.  I on the other hand..would love to love it...but can't.  It doesn't help that this is a new location with a full staff still in training. The service was slow and inept, the food was mediocre even by California Pizza Kitchen standards.    One thing that I do have to admit is that I have never been a huge fan of "novelty" pizzas.  I view Thai chicken pizza, buffalo chicken pizza as just that...novelties.  I put it in the same category as a "pizza" burger.  If I want Thai chicken...I'll go to a Thai restaurant.   There used to be a pizza here that I liked.  It had pepperoni, fresh mozzarella and capers on it.  It's not there anymore. I wonder if there was no room on the menu for it and the Cajun pizza. Sigh. My daughter and I each had a focaccia sandwiches.  I had the caesar salad, she the vegetarian.  Mine was non-descript, hers was actually quite good.  It had portabello shrooms along with red and yellow bell peppers.  If I am ever forced to go there again, maybe I'll order it.

In the heart of Old Scottsdale, Pischke's Paradise lies in wait...catching tourists and locals alike with their diverse menu, and incredible food!     Have had everything from breakfast to steak au poivre here.  Burgers,  salads, and steaks are good, but I always seem to gravitate back to their open face sandwiches on Boboli bread.  Try the Fire Island, or the Rocky Point Shrimp. Boboli bread with chicken or shrimp in a cream sauce topped with dofino cheese. You'll thank me later.    Ultra casual atmosphere, Fat Tire on tap, great food. What more can you ask for? Not much. Look for long waits at lunch or dinner...

Ate at WikiWiki for the first time today. I had high hopes for the food here as the guys at work seem to like it.   I ordered the #8, which is the BBQ chicken and crispy shrimp. I don't mind that it was dark meat as I think that it usually has better flavor. It was cooked well as was the shrimp. My issue was lack of flavor. If it weren't for the sauces, it would have been almost tasteless. Just not interesting. The shrimp were good, though small.  An even greater issue were the sides. The macaroni salad was bland and flavorless. The white rice seemed like an afterthought.  I ate the chicken and shrimp threw the rest away.

I went to Local Breeze for the first time last weekend. I have to admit that I was way more excited about seeing the friends I was meeting than anything I had read about the restaurant. The name sort of struck me as sort of odd for a downtown Phoenix restaurant. Don't know why.  But...I don't think so any longer! We drive up and I immediately love this joint. Friendly staff and a wonderful space. The house in which the kitchen resides is beautiful in a rustic yet refined sort of way if that is possible. :) But it is the patio where we sat. Open, dog friendly and comfortable, it was perfect.   Then you get to the menu....and I see that they have Fire Island and Rocky Point eggs! Turns out that a former member of Pischke's Paradise works their and has put these items on the menu. I thought they were lost to me forever! I would go back just for these two items (Fire Island Eggs in particular), but there is so much more.   So glad to have tried this place!

My wife and I were looking for a particular type of rose for our garden. We called this location and asked if they had it in stock and what the price was. They said they did and quoted us a price of $24.99 for a gallon sized plant. Good to go. We drive there and find the rose bush but it is listed as $44.99. So we go to the front and say that  we had called and driven 30 minutes to get this rose and we were told "Oops...sometimes the  prices on my list up front right". No sh!t Sherlock. So...will you honor the price quoted? NO.   So we drove down the street to A And P Nursery on Baseline west of Lindsay and got the same size plant that they were selling for $44.99 for $16.99.   Don't waste your time with these rip-off artists.

I recently purchased a house. Unbeknownst to me, it had a beehive in the wall. Wanting to use a local business (I always try to go local and support my neighbors instead of a corporation! ), I hit the internet and found that Desert Castle was in my area. Though it is not BBB Accredited, it had an A+ rating and no complaints. I always try to go local and support my neighbors instead of a corporation!   Bill showed up at my house the same day I called. And if he isn't the nicest guy you have ever met...I bet that he's in the top 10! Very professional, and to the point. He assessed the situation, told me what my options were, and t took care of my problem at a reasonable cost.   Now...I don't expect to need an exterminator every month, but if I have issues again, I will certainly be calling Desert Castle.

I have great insurance. Even after I paid the $40 co-pay they managed to over-charge me enough so that I still had another $60 balance after insurance. FastMed is the only urgent care provider where this happens. Shysters.

Got some takeout for lunch here today. Ordered it online and it worked out well. Had the Jalapeno Curry....and it was amazing. Ordered it hot. It was not overwhelming, ended up adding a little chili paste to it to kick it up a bit. The flavor profile was perfect. Perfectly cooked  vegetables with beef in a green coconut curry sauce. Staff was really nice and it was ready when they said it would be. Putting this restaurant in the "keeper" column. Go there. You will be glad you did!
