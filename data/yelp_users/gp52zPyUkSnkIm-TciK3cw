Scottsdale road has just about everything including Oscar Filet at Flemmings, ohhh yea !  Talk about decadent, they were serving a special the night we were there that  included the Oscar topping for the filet. Something about jumbo lump crab meat slathered on top of a perfectly cooked steak that is...... well..... just plain awesome!   Add a side of asparagus and a wedge salad with a nice cocktail and damn if that is not the start to a kick ass evening.   As always this location on the weekends was packed including the bar area, thank goodness for reso's.  Something about this Flemming's has more je ne se qua than  the "run of the mill" Flemmings( if there is such a thing).

A dive bar that features Chinese food? Now those aren't two things you hear in the same sentence!  After trying this place I know why!   My buddy and I stopped at Chop and Wok on the way to the airport  and ordered the food to go. The NFC championship game was on in the bar and patio area, so this review is a bit late.    We both got the same thing, a chicken and veggie combo on brown rice. I barely had time to eat a couple of bites as we rushed to return the rental car. 2 bites was 2 too many.  My navigator on the other had time for a bit more. Sad part is the chicken tasted like it was still frozen.  If you have ever microwaved one of those prefabbed frozen dinners, that is the level of flavor this dish had, bummer.   Had high hopes for this place but all I can say is yuck! I hate to give it 2 stars but that was some bad Chinese food.

We popped in here for drinks on a Friday on Barrett Jackson weekend for some drinks an people watching. Judging by the polarizing views of this place you either love it or hate it. I can't speak to the chow as we only came here after getting our VIP free cocktails from the fancy car auction.  The place was pretty packed and the live band set up and playing directly behind the main bar was doing a pretty decent job of entertaining the peeps dancing and signing along( "don't stop believin' " ) Anywho, yes there were cougars\pumas and yes there were younger people co-existing in the same space. All in all the service, libations, entertainment and the crowd were the makings of a good time.   Again this was on a busy weekend with lot's of tourists( us) and we weren't there for  dinna....so for the above mentioned 4 stars.
