The food was okay, the service was terrible.  Our waitress came over took our order then she went outside..for like 20 minutes. Meanwhile I could see our food sitting in the "pick up window" under the heat lamp..for like 10+ minutes. I was wondering why  the other waiter with one table wasn't just bringing it to us...it was like 3pm so the place was dead. Eventually I asked him to bring it to us, geeesh. Eventually our waitress came back then asked us how our food was then sat in the back corner and talked. Didn't come back for refills and didn't come to take our dirty plates even though she kept looking over at our table. Super disappointing.

My boyfriend and I came for our one year anniversary and boy was I surprised! I've always wanted to come to the Melting Pot but I never had a reason to spend so much money on Fondue!  When we got to the restaurant we were quickly seated in this secluded booth that was tucked away in the wall, then they closed a curtain in front of our booth and it was completely private! I thought that was so much fun!  Our servers name was Dan and he was great, very attentive and he walked us through the menu, (which was a little overwhelming), and made helpful suggestions.  We ended up doing the four course meal which came to like $90 dollars and it was SO GOOD. We started with what Dan suggested, the Spinach and Artichoke cheese dip which was served with granny smith apples, various breads and veggies. Dan made it right at our table which was great too!  When we took our first bite we were both immediately "wowed".  Then after that we both got our own house salad, the house dressing was great. When our main course came we chose our broth to cook our meat in and the meat we got was lobster tail, shrimp, pork, buffalo chicken, mushrooms in noodles (dumpling like) and beef. They were served with various sauces which I liked. Then last but not least, desert! YUM!! We decided on Bananas Foster and omg so great! The pound cake and brownies it came with was so good. I may have to come back just to get some more desert at some point! lol.   We ended up spending close to 2 hours here and it was really a wonderful romantic night! I loved the atmosphere and how our server cooked our food right in front of us. I look forward to coming back here in the future!

I first wandered into this store when I found myself to be the brand new mommy to my baby Shih-Tzu Mia. I'm sort of going through this..erm.."phase"..where I like to buy my puppy just about everything I see, so of course I couldn't resist the temptation to check this place out!   The store is small and jam packed with everything you could ever want for your furbaby from homemade treats, to cute clothes and collars, tons of food choices, training tools, bones and just about anything else you could ever want or need! I was slightly afraid I was going to knock everything over though when I was maneuvering through the store.  The woman in the store was really nice and knowledgeable and insisted that I bring my puppy in once she gets all of her shots, I'm going to be all over that when the time  comes haha! I ended up leaving with an assortment of puppy treats and once she's full grown I'll be back for a cute collar for her! They were kinda pricey so thats why I'm waiting! Anyways if you're an animal lover defiantly check this place out, it wont disappoint!

So like the other reviewer said, I also really love 50's-esque restaurants, so of course that's what originally drew me in to Sonic. I love the drive in and everything is reasonably priced and of course eating in my car with my friends with the windows down when its nice outside is fun! I mostly come in for Hot Fudge Sundaes when I have the craving and they're always so yummy. Also whenever my boyfriend and I have done the drive through they've been speedy!

My boyfriend and I recently took our new 11 week old Shih Tzu here to get her 2nd set of shots and we both were kind of nervous. That completely changed once we were greeted by their friendly staff!  They coo'ed over our puppy and took her in back to show to all of the vet techs and it was so apparent that they care a lot about the pets they see and their owners. Also everyone that came in or left while we were waiting were treated so genuinely, almost like everyone that came in was a close friend.  Once we entered the exam room they knowledgeably answered all of our questions an then some! They offered advice and when I asked our vet tech if our puppys nails were getting long she said yes, then went into the back and got nail clippers, and while clipping our puppys nails she taught us how to do it for future references! We saw Dr.Johnson and she was wonderful and  she thoroughly explained all of the shots she got that day and the ones she would be getting in the future.  This place is nothing short of amazing and if you're looking for a new vet  I would go to Foothills Animal Hospital in a heartbeat!

So let me start off with saying I REALLY wanted to like this place,. Back home there was a killer Chinese Buffet by my house so I was looking for a replacement, plus its right across the street, and had really good reviews so I had to check it out.   We went around 5:30 on a Wednesday..when we went in only a few other people were there our waitress came over and took our drink orders and off we went to get food. The first thing I ate was an egg roll which was pretty yummy, then I ate a small crab rangoon which was cold. Then when I went to eat my Orange chicken I noticed there was a black hair stuck in the chicken under the breading. Ew. I told our waitress and she apologized profusely, but by that time I had already lost my appetite. My boyfriend wasn't really impressed with his either (most of the food was barely lukewarm) but 'I told him we might as well try the sushi before we leave. At the sushi station you order your sushi and they make it fresh. There was a sign that said, "Brown rice upon request", so I asked for a spicy tuna roll with brown rice. The guy making the sushi responded with, "Maybe we don't have brown rice", avoiding eye contact with me. Awesome.   So after that we told the waitress we wanted the check  and she could tell we weren't pleased. Since I had only eaten an egg roll and one of their little crab rangoons I asked to have my bill either discounted or to not get charged for my meal. The waitress said she would talk to the manager. They didn't charge me for my meal which was good since I wasn't about to spend $15 on an egg roll. I also wasn't thrilled that the manger didn't come over. Oh well. Anyways I don't think I'll be back any time soon.

I've been here a total of 3 times now and the food never disappoints! This is my boyfriends favorite restaurant and now its mine too! My favorite things are the beef beer bread sandwich YUM and the calamari and the tartar sauce.. omg amazing! The service isn't always great (once we had a wonderful server, the next time our server was inattentive). Also the place doesn't have AC but it doesn't take away from the experience at all. Anyways I love love love this place and its always the the top of my list of where to go to dinner!

Today I went to Ikea and wandered around for a few hours ooo'ing and ahh'ing over all of the unique home decor.  This place is huge on the inside, offering a place for children to play while you shop, a food court, and even a small grocery section offering Swedish food! The prices are good and I love all of the ideas they displays give me for my home. The store was clean and very well organized but there were lots of people just slowly wandering around, kind of in the way, and a few groups of children and pre-teens just running around. Either way its not to big of a deal and its next to impossible to come into this store and leave empty handed!  Other cool things I noticed: Super cheap food, 50 cents for a hot dog and a $1 for an ice cream cone. Their family card offers you a free coffee or tea whenever you come in & discounts, pretty awesome.

Amazing bookstore. Plus there's always other great goodies around the store! I could spend  hours in this place just wandering around and finding cool stuff. Plus its right next to Wildflower.  Can't get any better than that!

When I first moved to Phoenix to live with my boyfriend I asked him to take me to In-N-Out since everyone seems to love this chain so much. When we went I just got a regular burger and my boyfriend got an animal style one, my boyfriend also mentioned that their fries are kinda soggy and gross so we ordered them well done.  Anyways my excitement quickly diminished when I took my first bite, I was just like, "Ew this is what all the excitement's about?", I was starting to wonder if people in the west have never had a decent burger!  My burger was boring and just whatever, I've had better fast food. My BF's tasted like burnt mustard, pretty gross. The fries apparently were a lot better well done but still totally bland..they tasted like something you could get from the freezer section at any grocery store.  Other than that the place was kinda dirty, maybe we got there after a rush, but the employees were all super nice!  Maybe I'll go and give them another try sometime..but I'm hesitant.

This was my second visit to The Original Burrito Co. and it id not disappoint. I got the #40 which is a burrito with eggs, cilantro, shredded beef (or chicken) and rice. I also added guacamole because well, I love guacamole.  The portion size was huge and it came with a side of chips which I didn't end up eating. My boyfriend also ordered some Carne Asada fries which were nothing special.   They have a lot of choices which I usually don't like but when it comes to burritos I don't mind. When we went the first time around 12pm there was literally no where to sit, it was jammed packed. Today we went around 1:45pm and not to many people were there.

I recently moved to AZ and I was bummed to find out that they didn't have a Panera in this state. My boyfriend then told me about Paradise Bakery and I was pleased to find  out it was owned by Panera Bread and basically the same thing!   When we walked in my first impression was that it was very clean, everyone was really friendly and they had great music playing in the background. They also had a lot of selection to choose from!  I ended up getting the Tomato & Mozzarella panini and my boyfriend got the Fontega Chicken panini with soup. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Plus both came with a Chocolate Chip cookie that was seriously to die for.   If you ever want a tasty sandwich/soup/salad I would definitely hit up Paradise!

I was hesitant to get my dog groomed here due to some of the bad reviews, but overall I am so glad I did!  The store is adorable, some of the prices on some things are kinda pricey only because I've seen the same products online considerably cheaper. There's also cute charms and toys and other odds and ends for our furry friends which is nice.  I also love all of the dogs running around the store, my puppy got to roam a little bit before we came and got her so she wasn't in a cage and she got to be with other doggies.  We had Ivan cut Mias hair, he came out before hand to see her and ask us what we wanted done, we ended up getting her bathed, and cut and styled as well as getting her nails done! It took 3 hours for her to be finished, I wish it was a little faster but maybe in the future it will be! We will definitely be back to get her hair done! Ivan did a great job!

This place is so good! My boyfriend brought it home for dinner one night and wow! We got a cheese pizza and a meat lovers of some sort and I've never once actually enjoyed a cheese pizza before Spinato's!  Also their home made sauce is sort of sweet  which I really enjoyed. When went back again on another occasion and they were all very friendly and the atmosphere was very warm and inviting. This place has definitely become a date night go to for my boyfriend and I!

So this was my first time getting my nails done in like 4 years, but now that I'm making my own money I decided to go get the Shellac nail service!  It came to $25 for a great gel manicure! They also told me if they get messed up within three weeks just to come back and they would fix it for free, which was nice since I'm so destructive haha.  This salon was so different than the others I've been to in the past, it wasn't like where there's tables set up in rows, there was just one long row that everyone sits at..its so cute! Plus the pedi area was really nice..I may try to get one eventually I'm jut so ticklish! In addition the receptionist was nice and offered me a water bottle and the girl that did my nails was nice too, she didn't talk really so i didn't get her name.  It's very spa like inside, they also had a large TV to watch. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the music, it went from top 40, to modern country, to country music my grandparents would listen to..I would prefer spa music or something.  Anyways I am defiantly going to be a regular here, I'm already excited to go back and get a new color on!

Well right when I moved to AZ I asked my boyfriend (who has lived here his whole life) to take me to In-N-Out since I heard their burgers were great. BLECH. Talk about  mediocre. So the next time I wanted a burger we came to The Habit and it was soooo much better! I love that their menu doesn't have a ton of options and every time we go they're super yummy. My favorite thing is the teriyaki charburger! Yum.

I've been to this bar about 3 times and I've never, ever had a bad experience! When I first went I had the Honey Hot wings and they were super yummy. The next time went we got Chicken Nachos and Calamari, both were good, not like over the top tasty but  still good. The last time I went I got some sort of hamburger with avocado on it and it was good..but I did ask for it medium rare and it came out well done..that was the only time something wasn't exactly how I wanted it. Overall I do like coming here to just hang out, I'll defiantly be going back!

They did an AMAZING job!! I brought in my 17 week old Shih Tzu in armed with a list of do's and don'ts and some pictures of other Shih Tzu's that I liked and all I can say is wow! They completely exceeded my expectations! When I came in I believe I spoke with the owner and she reassured me everything would be fine and she told me how she understood exactly what I was asking for. Plus it was right across the street. I'm actually looking forward to Mias hair growing out so I can go get her hair done again! lol

I was so excited when I saw that a Sprouts was opening right down the street. So of course my boyfriend and I went to the grand opening! It was basically chaos in there but  it was clean, well organized and lots of staff were on hand to help everyone find exactly what they needed! We ended up buying some sushi, bulk granola and some other odds and ends. The granola was seriously wonderful.  The only downfall is all of the screaming children, and the children not being controlled by their parents, ick it made me anxious. When we checked out there was seriously like 20+ people in each line but they had, "line bouncers", to make sure people weren't cutting or anything and they efficiently got us through the line quickly! Plus we got a free reusable sprouts bag!  I will defiantly be a frequent shopper at Sprouts!

On Thursday the 10th my boyfriend and I brought our Shih Tzu up to Cage Free Grooming to get her hair cut. I really liked the atmosphere of the place and how it was so open, and of course the whole cage free concept. Our dog has been groomed several times in the past with no problems however due to the cage free idea we decided to give this place a shot.  When we dropped our dog off we gave the instructions to leave her head alone and just trim up her beard and kinda round it so its not cut straight across, cut her entire body short and just leave everything else alone. When we picked her up I thought she looked a little funky but she was running around because she was so excited so we just took her home.   Once we got home I realized how bad her facial hair was butchered!  ALL of her facial hair was completely cut off, her body was cut short but the front of her legs were still kinda poofy!! My 7 month old puppy looks like a senior dog. I've never heard of cutting a Shih Tzu's facial hair down to the muzzle but ugh. Its just choppy and bad.  Hopefully her hair will grow out quickly cause she looks awful.  (If you look at the pictures of her posted you can see how choppy and awful her beard is, her legs were left poofy, they SHAVED in between her eyes instead of using thinning sheers to trim it down, and her eyelashes were cut off all the way too)  We eventually talked to the owner wanting a refund and his excuse was the groomer that cut our dogs hair does show dogs, especially shih tzus, which is HILARIOUS considering that he chopped off her eyelashes and all of the hair that is expected to be there for the breed standard. Cutting a Shih Tzu down to her muzzle looks terrible. They offered to fix her hair if we brought her in but since he cut off all of her fur there's nothing to fix, then he refused a refund.   What a joke. People keep telling us we shouldn't have paid for this awful groom and I'm so sorry we did.  ~**UPDATE**~ Late last month the owners sent me an email asking me to take down my review and they will give me a refund once it's down. I couldn't help but laugh out loud. If this situation was handled correctly in the first place a review would never have been written. Here's what a responsible owner would do, just give us the refund and ask us to consider to take down the review, or modify it..geesh customer service 101 much? The male groomer that groomed my dog did a horrendous job  and I hope no one ever has to go through what I had to with his hot mess of a dog salon.   Also another groomer found Mia's pictures and asked if they could use them as an example of a bad groom. Embarrassing, but glad we could help them out since the damage was done. Even other groomers can tell how bad she looked.  http://www.groomingdalespetsalon.com/we_get_pets/2013/8/Thinning-Shears-VS-Grooming-Shears

Once I saw this place going up I was excited to go with my boyfriend, however i ended up going with a group of six friends.  To keep it short this place seems to be decor confused. Classy restaurant meets barn maybe? It's small in the inside an while the tables have white table cloths and candles in an attempt to be nice, there's writing all over the pillars inside so while sitting at our table I got to look at a permanent marker penis drawn on a pillar. Classy.  The food was way over priced I guess in an attempt to make it seem like you were getting quality food. My friend and I got pasta that was inedible. The shrimp in it was hard and the scallops were awful. It tasted so fake and I was confused to why it was an $18 dish. It was honestly reminiscent of a lean cuisine. No one else at the table seemed to like their food either.  Our first clue should have been how empty the place was. Oh well..at least the free bread was good!

My boyfriend and I have passed this place countless times and this time we decided to go inside and check it out. When we first walked in we had a sample of the pumpkin spice and wow!  YUM. So moist and sweet. We ended up buying two of the smaller cakes, lemon and pecan praline. Like I said, moist and sweet wonderfulness!!  Lemon was our favorite and we're stopping by in the near future to try the chocolate flavor and the raspberry cakes!!
