Really how is this place not a 5 star!?!Best sushi in town hands down. Fast service ,friendly staff. Personal favorite golden state, getting hungry just thinking about it.

I came in with a friend as a walk in we asked if they could do  two pedicures the woman said she could apparently she was the only woman on staff she several times complained out loud to us about how there was too many people I honestly felt like asking it would be better if we left because it seemed to be bothering her that there was customers. she had to call another woman to come in who is nowhere near the store to help more people who walked in after us. She turned on the water to have my feet soaked I had to remove my feet because it was so hot she came back and had to turn it down. In the end my toe polish is not even ,my feet are actually more rough now that she went at them with the scrubber very quickly .all in all kinda painful she was in a hurry and took no time to detail I won't be coming back and I won't be suggesting it to anybody I know.

Clean & great prices! I have got a lot of little ones gifts on the cheap and all my friends want to know where I find them. New born w/ tags for under $6.  Also they are local!

1 word YUM! Great coffee & vegan pastries, super nice staff. Laid back vibe ,not too pricey. I haven't been to any of the shows they have there ,but ever time I drive by it seems hopping .  Tip: Try the nitro coffee(for extra fun add Kahlua)  Bonus their local!
