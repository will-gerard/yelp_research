Damn. First, I thought, $4.50 for a gelato and only one scoop of it...that's a lotta money even for Vegas.  Then I saw the scoop. It's like 2 pretty big scoops pretending to be one. I ordered the blackberry one since I've been obsessed with blackberries lately and damn, it was good.  A great light dessert before dancing the night away in Vegas.

This place is REALLY good. I got this as a suggestion from a friend after I had told my friends I was headed to Phoenix. This place really wasn't close where I was staying in Tempe, but definitely WORTH IT.   I got there myself and there was probably an hour wait going on, but being by myself, I was seated at the one extra spot at the bar. Lucky me. No wait at all! (I actually love going places myself exactly for that reason).   The waitstaff was super helpful. The bartender that day was the owner's son - so I definitely know I was getting some good advice. I ended up getting one pizza to myself (and somehow I finished it). I ordered it with half a wiseguy (which was sausage and caramelized onions) and half margherita (mozzarella and basil). It was so good - definitely so worth it. Then I got the chocolate cake to finish - definitely worth it to get it even though I was so full already.   Protip: Definitely choose to come here if you're in the area.

I would have never chosen this place to stay when in Vegas. Since turning 21, I've only gone to Vegas with my friends so we tend to stay closer to whatever club we intended on going to. As I was with my parents and kids my brothers age (aka 16-18), clubs were definitely not what we were concerned about.   The Good:  The stratosphere itself is free to hotel guests. The lines aren't that long, guess it depends on when you go. You can get to the top pretty easily - 10 people to an elevator. Getting to the top was great. Stop off on floor 108 for the inside observatory and floor 109 for the outside. The inside was pretty cool. That's also where they have the bungee jumping - there was someone doing it when we were up there. Pretty awesome. The outside observation deck is cold in the winter, but the views are gorgeous up there!   The bar at the 107 floor is pretty cool too. Definitely a cheap way to get to the top and see the views without having to pay all that money for the stratosphere.   The bad:  Honestly, the location is just far from everything. Maybe except the SLS, which is still far from all the other hotels on the strip. It's just north, much more north than I thought. Since they're building resort world, it just seems so much further from everything right now. At any time, it's just about a $20 cab ride to the strip (even more if there's a ton of traffic). Then again, you could just drive yourself, but if you plan on drinking, it's not fun.   The Ugly: My mom ordered the deluxe room for the stay, but the other people ordered the premier room so my mom called the hotel to see how big of a difference it would be. They told her $15 per room per day. Not a big deal. Then, when we arrived, the price changed to $30 per room per day to upgrade and that was not what the hotel told my mom when she called. Anyways, after an hour wait and discussions with the manager (and some angry words from my dad), we got the hotel rooms as we thought. However, no strip view which is what was promised with the $30 extra dollars paid by our friends. Also, our rooms were not next to each other but close enough. Regardless, not happy by the time we made it into our rooms.   Overall bad experience and probably never going to stay here again. it's not a bad hotel persay, but I like staying closer to all the fun and the amazing food!

The buffet at Wynn is beautiful. They have some of the prettiest flower decorations and some decently good food.   We got in around brunch time and right before it turned to dinner. Therefore we were able to get some king crab legs. They were delicious. The breakfast portion was delicious. They have omelette station and definitely one of the best I've had.  The food was decent, but not amazing.   Definitely love the dessert part of the buffet. Had to try almost one of everything.   Overall, long lines which aren't so great, but the food and decorations were great!

So, first time in Vegas, staying off the Strip. Okay, not a bad idea. It was super cheap for us all to stay together in in a suite with two bedrooms, then again, there was like 20 of us.   It's pretty close to the strip, but in the heat, it seems like it's forever.   The pool was pretty nice, but you know, a poolside bar would have been nice as well. It was just nice to get out and have a nice time.  It's a pretty big place: bedrooms, two baths, kitchen, laundry, living room and dining room.

$14 for a yard of 190 octane and 2 shots of everclear.  That's what my friends made me order for my first time there. I know there are flavors that may have less alcohol like what one of my friends was trying to order for her first but to be honest, we're in Vegas to get drunk not too drink fruity drinks to taste good.   Wow, since i barely jade a breakfast, this was one of the first things going into my stomach and i got tipsy quite quickly..at around 11. But it's Vegas right?  definitely will get a better flavor i go next time but go big the first time around!

We went again -  this time I got the Bellini one...with no extra shots, just regular ol' drink. Delicious! Better tasting the 190 Octane + two shots. My friends...to say the least, are crazy.

YAY! This is yummy.  I came here twice, each for lunch, for my time in Vegas.  I got to share a Carribean Jerk Chicken and the Full Montagu with a friend of mine. I also got to try the tomato soup as well. I think my favorite that time was Carribean Jerk Chicken.  Next time I got the Earl's Club and damn that was good too.   The food was good for its price. $6 for a sandwich YUM.  Can't WAIT to go back!

So much fun with friends. We came on a saturday night around 1am and sang our hearts out. I will say that drinking soju and eating some rice cake. SEOUL TRAIN is definitely something i haven't seen in person, but did this time around.  The songs are really good - popular music totally available! LOVED IT!

Ever since I watched the movie, I've wanted to try this place. Frozen hot chocolate anyone?   Since I wasn't able to go to the location in New York, I figured I would just go in Vegas. First time I went on Christmas, for lunch, I went myself and sat at the bar (since the wait was about 30 minutes for a table). I ordered myself a frozen hot chocolate and a side of sweet potato fries. The frozen hot chocolate is HUGE. The size for one is plenty for a table. The bar is a great place to eat if all your people are over 21 and there are seats there. The frozen hot chocolate itself   The second time I went with the kids on the trip to vegas (4 of them between 16 and 18). I reserved a table for all of us, but we were able to be seated quite quickly. At around 10, there aren't as many people in the restaurant. The service, though, once seated was a little spotty. It took a while to get someone to take our order..and then get the food.   The smores hot chocolate (which is what one of the girls got) looked good, but they forgot the graham crackers and didn't bring them until we asked for them. Also the hot chocolate had a huge mound of marshmallows so if you dont like those - don't get it.   My brother ended up getting the Oreo version of the frozen hot chocolate which tasted like oreo hot chocolate but cold. This second time I ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae (chocolate blackout cake, chocolate and vanilla ice creams, and a shit ton of whipped cream). So delicious, but halfway in, I was so full, I couldn't take another bite. The cake wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had.   Overall, big portions. Decent desserts. Always make a reservation and you'll be fine. Or sit at the bar. Service will be spotty, but you'll just have to deal with it.

This was definitely a check off on my bucket list.   I wanted to do it in sunny Phoenix since well a few things. It's a little less pricy than doing it in Napa, but I still wanted to see some really beautiful items.  Honestly, it's so pretty and peaceful up there. We went up and down through various parts of the desert and got some lessons about the atmosphere along the way. Also someone proposed on my ride!! So awesome.   I had a ton of fun and definitely worth it all!   Protip: DO IT.

Last time I had gone to Vegas, I had really wanted to try Gordon Ramsay steak - you know for the oh so famous beef wellington. Couldn't go with the family last time, so instead, this next I went to LV, I went with a friend of mine.   First, cute and creative way into the restaurant. Riding the tube underneath and channel to get to London and the restaurant from Paris (the city and casino). Second, there's this huge red lit sculpture at the ceiling which is apparently Chef Ramsay's hand movements when he plates beef wellington. Kind of looks like a bunch of squiggles, but pretty cool regardless.   The Drink:  Pimm's Cup: Apparently this had gin and sparkling lemonade. It literally tasted like fruit juice to my friend and me. Definitely dangerous since you could drink it and not taste the alcohol. Love the fruit that it comes with.   The Food:  Bread (Lemon thyme, Mushroom and pancetta, and baguette): all three of them were different and delicious. Eat them. Get seconds. The butter is delicious too with the sprinkling of sea salt on top. Foie gras: Yes! I love foie gras, especially if it's been seared correctly. This foie was melt in your mouth deliciousness. The goat cheese popovers were a great little contrast in taste, but definitely same creaminess expected.  Beef Wellington: You can definitely share the plate for 1. It comes in 2 pieces so you can definitely share. The mashed potatoes are nice and creamy just as I expected Gordon Ramsey's mashed potatoes should be (you know after watching people make them in Hells Kitchen for years).  Ribcap: Definitely didn't have other stuff on it, but it was so tender and easy to cut through. The ribcap is definitely a must do. It's tender as filet mignon and as bold as ribeye. YUM! Mac n Cheese: Nothing too memorable about it. Wasn't too bad, but it wasn't amazing either. Good, but nothing compared to the meat we had gotten.  Sticky Toffee Pudding: Just the description of the dessert made it sound delicious - sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream. The cake was not too sweet, but the toffee made it moist and gooey - almost like a bread pudding with caramel on it. The brown butter ice cream was oh so good, I just wished there had been a lot more of it. Also prepared so it looked like we were getter butter which I thought was really creative.   Overall, such a good meal. We ate like royalty and it was delicious.  Service was pretty good throughout the night, and we noted that there were 3 different type of individuals working the floor that interacted with us. It was pretty fun to go out, get a little dressed up and eat a great dinner.   Protip: Get a reservation. Get the beef wellington. it's probably Ramsey's most famous dish and deservingly so. The sticky toffee pudding is definitely worth the calories.

We definitely gave Gordon Ramsay a bunch of money this time we went to LV. Steakhouse and then Burgr.   My friend and I got there right as they were opening so it was easy to get a spot. Get there early and it'll be good. The line was probably 10 tables waiting in line, but it seemed like they were trying to seat everyone as soon as possible.   We ordered the jalapeno poppers to share. 6 of them, 3 each. They were a bit spicy for my tastes even using the ranch dressing that came with it. I had to drench it in the sauce, but I think that seeds were still in the jalapeno so it was spicy! (at least for me).   I ended up ordering the Farm Burger (duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, fried egg). Honestly, the burger was a bit more done than I wanted it. However, the duck breast bacon - that is good. I wanted more of that. I cut it in half and the egg was gooey and flowed out. So delicious.   Overall, great place to get a good burger. More expensive than a burger from a fast food place, but it was definitely good.   Protip: get there early to not wait long to get a table. Duck breast bacon is as delicious as it sounds.

This place is so good. I wanted to find the best place to eat in Phoenix and damn, this place had some really good BBQ.   I definitely got more than I could eat. I somehow thought I could get a plate with two different meats and two sides. Also an extra sausage. So somehow I ended up with a sausage, brisket and pulled pork. We had gotten a sample of the sausage and it was so good. YUM. The people before us got the last bit of the brisket so I got a new one. The guy cutting the meat also gave us some samples before we had to get the food. It was so fatty and tender. The pulled pork was delicious with the store's BBQ sauce too.   I ended up getting the grits and potato salad. Grits were good, but the potato salad was AMAZING. I also ended up getting the pecan pie - I ate it the next day and it was still good. LOVE LOVE LOVE.   Protip: I probably ended up getting there 45 mins beforehand. Definitely get there at least half an hour early to get at a decent place in line.

For Christmas dinner, making a reservation for 14 different people is difficult. We were able to come here and get some set menus. There were 3 different versions mostly with the same dishes and some with different ones. There was 1 one with 5 dishes and the other 2 had 7 dishes. To be honest, the size of the 7 dishes was too much.   The 7 dishes were the following and in this order: Eggplant salad - since I don't like eggplant, I only had a small part of it. Everyone else enjoyed it a lot.  Chilean sea bass - small piece of sea bass with some spicy veggies underneath. The sea bass was very nicely cooked. Flaky and delicious. The hot sauce mixed with the carrots, onion and sprouts were delicious together. Probably one of my favorite dishes. Chicken thigh - Chicken thigh wrapped around kimchi, zucchini,  and other veggies. The thigh was so moist and sauce was great too! Pork belly - the 5 courses had the 10 hour braised pork belly. This was definitely more flavorful and had a nice texture. Definitely chewier. The 7 courses had the 30 hour sous vided belly that was more chewy. The accompaniments were forgettable but both had the same sweet potato.  Short rib - probably my favorite dish. The short rib was nicely cooked and the potatoes that came with it were so delicious.  Gratin yum.    The other dishes that came with the 7 courses are:  Seared salmon - salad with basically lightly seared salmon. Very rare salmon, almost sashimi style.  Chicken porridge - it's not as good as my mom makes it. But it's as good as any of the restaurant ones I've had.  Beef takaki - a little rare for my tastes. Seared very lightly. The sauce (bean paste aioli) was all over it. A bit too much for my tastes.   The lady who was vegetarian has jiajiangmen and she said it was delicious.  Smelled good too.   Dessert was a berry creme brulee. It tasted a bit funny. Personally I've had quite a few creme brulee in my time and my friend makes a better one.    Overall,  food was good. Service was great. So accommodating for the Chinese parents we have.   As a suggestion, I would say that for big groups have everyone order the same menu so it makes it easier for the chef and waitresses to remember who got what. Some people in our group got the wrong items. Also because the people who got 7 courses got their items out of order. The seared salmon and beef takaki were last before dessert and it was an awkward to eat my meal like that.

The Moxy has definitely a different feel from any of the other Marriott locations I've stayed at.   It's got a great vibe to it. Once we walk in, it's like a bar with the check in counter. I will admit, it was slightly confusing. They do have some popular drinks and it was nice to stay there. Also, if you happen to get food there, get the breakfast naan - definitely delicious!   Free yoga on Sunday mornings (with mimosas). Pinball machines in the lobby area. Free bike rentals. Pool cabanas and a great pool area. The gym was alright, but not the main focus for most people I think.  The staff was awesome and remembered that I was there for a hot air balloon ride so kept asking me about it. LOVED IT.   The service was great. I will admit, it was loud some nights. I really wanted to sleep some nights really early since I was getting up early the next day and this place was just...okay in that regard.   Also, I do wish they had a closet instead of hangers on the wall.   Protip: get a drink and a naan. They are delicious.  It's definitely a great different kind of location.
