THE GOLD STANDARD!!!   They did such an amazing job with my car. i needed to have the poor thing jump started.. coming from ALASKA to the heat of Phoenix, my poor battery just couldnt take it..   they were the ones who informed me my car had the service package where as the place I BOUGHT IT FROM  failed to!  they repaired a small under body issue for free, got my battery installed and did the oil change and tune up in RECORD TIME!   customer service WAS THE BEST I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED!

Absolutely horrible service. They refused to do propane after their streetlights come on even if it's a bright out tried to tell me he would get fired. Five people waiting for propane and he refused to come outside told me the propane tank turns off because the sun starts to set.

First time! After asking some fellow YELPERS where do i go.. they didnt point me in the wrong direction!   the place is small. but i like that. makes me feel like its a mom and pop place.. but then again it is.  The service was great even though they were busy ( i went at lunch )  they were quick getting the food to the table and it was piping hot!  the chips and salsa were really good.    I ordered the Baja Chicken Burro! and it was GOOOOOD!

After numerous phone calls and driving down to the store I was given horriable. Customer service. They were rude on the phone and in person. They were rude to a family member who called also. I won't give these people a dime of my money.

i really like this safeway! better than FRY's ....  the only reason it didnt get 5 stars.. it has a POOR selection of asian ingredients.

I heard of this place, from a few people and some Yelpers. i drove past and decided to go ahead and stop... IM GLAD I DID!   Being a person who absolutely loves to cook and is always looking for that special ingredient, i know ill find it here.  I went in thinking i wasn't going to find the specific chili peppers i was looking for because they are hard to find anyway. But low and behold there they were a lowly package sitting all by themselves just waiting for me!   I meandered through the store and found so many more things. They have an amazing cheese selection. (which is another weakness of mine)  They have a variety of beers and wines, which is always nice when you are entertaining or just for a special night in.   They have a deli and a coffee stand which most grocery stores do now which is nice, I love the idea of a little eatery where you can sit on the outside and enjoy this cooler weather we are having.   Give it a shot i know you will like it!

One of the best places in Vegas I ate at . The drinks were great. the service was awesome!! and my food was amazing! The pizza my husband got was really good and the Organic Chicken was to die for!   any place that serves Maytag blue cheese sauce is going to be a winner far as im concerned! :)

ok for you beer fans!!!   the yard house is on POINT!! if you want it you'll most likely find it.   now the food is good. but then again when i went in i was starving and i think the south end of a north bound bull would have been just fine with me.  The tender was really helpful and had a great knowledge of the selection. But i was a creature of habit, and went with a Guinness! wings, and football on saturday afternoon..

What a dump! The arcade was rundown, most of the machines are out of order. Everything is over priced. The races are 25.00 per person for 10 minutes! The management was unprofessional. There were literally two teenagers running the place. They did not run it like it is a business, they ignored the few customers that were in there. We waited at the counter for 10 minutes and the people who were in front of us had been there longer. The girl at the counter was in eyesight but on a cell phone. Both the men's and women's restrooms were out of order, and the entire establishment was dirty. SAVE YOUR MONEY,

Portion size was great.. a little to much for me but most people would find that as a huge plus.   I got the carne asada burrito!! YUMM YUMM. i tried all the salsas too. they were very good.  the service was friendly and the food was good what else could you ask for!   final.. Price was nice, food was great! service with a smile! I will be back for seconds :)

Good time! I have only been here twice. the first time was a disaster! we asked for medium burgers and got rare. Knowing what its like to send things back and have fear they (the kitchen staff at ANY place are going to do something to it) so we just ate the sides and payed for the burger bite later. :( yuck..   The second time we went IT WAS AWESOME we told them how the first experiance was and they apologized for that and gave us a free dissert. not the usual cotton candy, but a baked cookie (which was not cooked.. how ironic) we said thanks and let them know the rest of the meal was fantastic!  This is one of those places it would be perfect for a sandwich and BEERS. the ambiance is great. the service is awesome, but go here for the drinks.. and the bull riding!

Went here based on the yelp reviews.. It was not disappointing. I had the biscuits and gravy (chorizo gravy) and my boyfriend had the chicken fried steak. We got there so early we even got to eat breakfast with Joe (the owner).. I recommend!!

i was recently married here.9/14/2013.. im going to be brutally honest.. this was a disaster from day 1. we were one of the last if not LAST people to be able to be married in the Wine Bar area.   I felt like i was second best to the "big barn bride" i was made to feel my $5000 was below them.   I was given 3 different coordinators from Feb 13 to Aug 13, because they all quit working there. Now... i understand that maybe this is out of their hands.. but it made every step tough, emails were lost, (i saved mine) agreements were not kept.  I had to be very flexible to accommodate the big barn bride at all times. I wasn't allowed to have photos taken by certain things, i wasn't able to just walk out of a the bridal cottage because "we don't want to inconvenience the big barn bride who wasn't in there, and her things that were. she rented the cottage, its hers so you are not able to step out of the door" so i was taken from my bridal room, to the back of the bridal cottage (the office) to stand and wait in the heat.. but because the big barn bride was taking photographs.. i had to be taken back to the bridal room so she didn't see me... then not even 5 min later.. i was walked back over to the office area because she was done with her pictures. Mind you during this entire time my guests have arrived, they all have seen me at this point.. to include my fiance.. so the first look walking down the aisle was gone.. the one thing he asked for .. i dont want to see her before the wedding.. that was the ONLY tradition we wanted.   During the ceremony..the groom, grooms men and my girls were not in the right order, the bridesmaids were not handed their flowers. I was told upon asking.."where are their bouquets?" the answer was..."oh well i guess they forgot to grab them".. Isn't that what your there for? to line everyone up in order, make sure they are on time, maybe see they don't have the bouquets. and hand them to them.. if its not .. then wouldn't you do it out of sheer courtesy?  once the main manager (Katie) saw the girls didn't have bouquets.. her jaw dropped and my coordinator was dismissed.. i didn't see her the rest of the night, until i started packing up decorations and she handed me a bottle of wine..  to top it off.. nobody did anything about the cock fight that was happening in the drive way... it wasnt until in the middle of my ceremony when i said.. someone kill that turkey! and a laugh.. (movie quote) then out of the corner of my eye.. i see the owner running over to sho them away.. (thank you sir.. you saved the last 5 minutes of my wedding video)   at two months before the wedding they literally told me if i didn't want to get married at the time of day they picked out (because any earlier time would have interfered with the big barn bride) i could take my money elsewhere.  I was in tears the entire time i had to speak to them, i was nervous opening up emails from them because i was so worried they were going to cancel on me..   i wasn't asking for things to be above and beyond i was just asking for courtesy.  i would have done anything for the other bride to have her day be special too..  when i found the booth at the January phoenix bridal show i knew this is where i wanted to be married.. it was and is an absolutely beautiful location..i should have listened to a few people who used to work there (a manager, photographer and a cake decorator) say i shouldn't.. now i know why.. maybe for 2 thousand more ($7000 is the price for the big barn) dollars i would have been treated better.. but i didn't want that large of a wedding.. i just wanted something small. intimate, and quaint..  closest friends and family.. i could have filled the big barn to the brim with people but it wasn't what i wanted.   but i did and still do feel like i was second best and that i was a burden on them.   but on that note...there are certain people i want to give a 5 star rating to.   The bar staff.. the bar staff was an absolute joy! they helped with clean up because they saw me doing it. (cleaning the dishes from the table) Specifically would like to say thank you to Chris specifically.. You made my sister in law feel so special when you helped her carry water bottles!   The DJ. DJ Ramsey Saba, you got everyone out of your seat.. I LOVED the music you put together! and thank you thank you for making us a wedding copy.. now we will have the music every anniversary to come.   the Caterer: 5 star catering and Chef Le.. the food was amazing..  The bakery Lesley's cakes.. Absolutely fantastic! Cant wait to share the word.. i will also be coming back in a year to get a remake! :)   Sarah's garden: as i said to you. i loved them.. the boquets were lovely. just wish they would have made it into the ceremony.. and after..

Found this place on accident.  As many other Yelpers.. Neno, hooked us up with free samples, soup and made sure we were happy.. he knows word of mouth is the best advertising!  we ordered the Flafel salad, chicken sandwich, and i ordered the Gyro dinner with rice.  The food was fantastic! the soups were delicious. the price was perfect! portions were out of control!   If you go, you will be back, i know I have!
