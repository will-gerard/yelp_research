Don't waste your time or money  We went to Schnepf Farms today and paid $5 per person (instead of $2) so we could ride all of the rides.  Only problem.... not one single ride was open.  People were just wandering around looking for something do.  Total waste of time and money.

Linda is an awesome yoga teacher who truly understands the physical, mental, and emotional combination that is Yoga.  She is knowledgeable, informative and a beautiful all around person.  I never felt alone or like a newbie in her classes.  Linda welcomed me to the class personally, asked how she could be of service, and then presented an awesome class.  Truly one of the best studios you will find.
