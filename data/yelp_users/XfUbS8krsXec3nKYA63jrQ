One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in AZ. I've been stopping in here occasionally for years, ever since they were known as Hong Kong Noodle House and the original little Lee Lee's market was next door (with the exact same smiling owner with the exact same yellow shirt standing by the door!).    There are always plenty of junk Chinese food joints around with the oily egg rolls and fried rice, but a real decent place is hard to find in Arizona. Something that irks me about Chinese restaurants is that many of them have a secret menu with the good stuff written in Chinese, and another one with all the greasy junk in English for the gringos, but Best HK doesn't do that.  It has a single menu in English and Chinese side by side and that's the way it should be.  A couple of my favorites here are Singapore style fine rice noodles and oysters with black bean sauce in season, and hot pots, and...

Well, some dishes are good and some dishes are not so good.  Portions on the small side compared with ACE and Mekong Palace a mile north.  3 1/2 rounded up to 4.

Best Korean restaurant that I know about in this state.  Sometimes the service is terribly slow, and the owners seem to keep changing, and the side dishes are not the greatest, but the chef must stay the same, because the food always stays the same, excellent!  Update 12/12/09.  Consistently excellent always.  Friendly service (and fast!).  Best Korean in the state.

Always outstanding.  Try the pork bulgogi.  Terrific!  It's all authentic, and now including steel chopsticks. The only thing that would be better at a really good place in Koreatown, California would be the side dishes.

I saw a few comments here saying that this is a bad area for Asian food so they're surprised to find Hodori.  Are you serious? I think thisDobson Rd and vicinity area is great for Asian food - Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and more.  Hodori itself is very excellent.  I've been coming here for years.

Unlike KFC, here they know how to make fried chicken right, and cheap too, particularly on Tuesdays when they practically give it away.

Deserves another 1/2 star, so 3 1/2 rounded up to 4.  I like the pineapple fried rice with steamed tofu. Always to take out, of course.  This tiny place isn't a place you really want to eat in.  Some reports of food poisoning below,  but I never had a problem, and they've been in business for a long time.

Their delicious pineapple fried rice with steamed tofu is my favorite at this take out place, in fact that's all I get here, tho I'm told their Thai noodle dishes are also good  Always friendly.    Why is it named Szechuan Express since it's a Thai place?  I don't know.  TIP:  TELL THEM NO MSG!!!

Didn't care for it.  Expensive, small portions, and mediocre cooking.  Go a few blocks west to Saigon Pho if you want the real thing.  But this place is prettier, whatever that's worth to you.

I should have made a U-turn as soon as I saw the zodiac place mats and forks but no chopsticks on the tables.  Ordered Singapore style rice noodles to go, $10. The noodles were soggy, the shrimps tasteless, and the whole dish was a bland mushy mess.  Ugh.

This is just a review for the deep fried oysters, $15.  Small oysters inside lots of very oily breading.  A little shredded lettuce and tea and rice and salt and that's it.  I think I ordered the wrong thing.

Takeout porterhouse steak was way undercooked, like half raw.  Unfortunately by the time I found out I was miles away.  I wrote this same complaint to Outback at their online address.  I was surprised to receive a phone call from the manager two days later - but he just asked me when I was there, and didn't say a  word of apology or offer me maybe 1% off  or a free glass of water  if I came back again.  He just said, "I'll look into it and get back to you."  That was a week ago.  Weird.  Outbacks were really good years ago, though the other one I tried a few days before  this one (see my review) was pretty good and much friendlier too.

Tried this place for the first time.  Why do people like it so much?  I think that there are way better Viet places not very far away. I ordered rare beef pho. The bowl was quite small - not "gigantic" like some of the reviewers are saying.  Small.  Smaller than I am used to, and i didn't order a small bowl.  There was only one size choice and that's what I ordered.  I think it was $6.50.  The broth was salty and not very tasty and the rare beef wasn't very rare. 1 1/2 rounded up to 2.

The last time I was here, a number of years ago, the buffet was the thing not to get here, but now it seems to have gone full circle and now it is the thing to get, and I agree with everyone else, it is very good, very fresh ingredients.  The celebrated fried banana was too oily for my taste though, and the Thai chicken wings were just OK.

Went a little earlier and tried the buffet.  It's nothing special.  Dishes tended to be very oily and/or boring and/or over-spiced.  LOS is located in what must be one of the strangest outdoor shopping centers, or whatever you call it, in the country.  Mostly down and out and closed, but the far end seems to be populated with pervert joints, and odd Asian places are scattered around, as well as a bail bond and lawyer office and a jewelry store or two with many guards, and miscellaneous other strange flotsam and jetsam..

Oyster Bar combo pan roast, $24.  A  discordant mish mash of spiced up odds and ends with about 4 big shrimps thrown in.   I don't get it?  What's so great?  I think it costs 2 or 3 times what it should.  Slightly odd slightly smirky server.  Inside a casino.  I thought it was slightly weird, but then I think the whole Las Vegas scene is weird.

Number one!  The best!    Sushi Ken was formerly the great Sushi Ten of Tucson.  It's the best dollar for dollar sushi joint in the country, if not the whole world!  Their chirashi rules!  Note: Sushi Ten remains in Tucson, but in name only.  This is the real Sushi Ten!

Update 11/13/10  I've had various regular dishes here now in addition to the dim sum.  Very good place.  Mostly Chinese client√®le.  The English amongst some of the servers is weak, and the special board is written in Chinese only, but the menu is printed Chinese/English side by side, which is the way it should be, as opposed to many Chinese restaurants with their special Chinese menu with the good stuff on it, and the English menu with the fried rice and crab puff junk.  July 1, 2011 note:  I haven't been here lately, but I've gotten some reports that it's not as good as it was.  That may be reflected in the newer Yelp reviews.

I'll revise that to the consistently best Chinese restaurant in the state that I know of.  I'm talking about prepared dishes as I usually don't do dim sum.  My complaint, though, still remains, namely the specials are mostly untranslated.

Update June 21, 2011  You get a lot for very little money here.  Not everything is great though.  It can be inconsistent.  The ma po tofu, for example, is badly done, soupy;  Singapore style chow mai fun is better at Best Hong Kong down the block; chow fun, I've had much better - but, as you can see from all the reviews, many items are very good indeed.  And they will cook up seafood you buy across the street at Mekong Market for $5.  Give it 5 stars for value.

XMRj865sZBPWCI7tx0uBWw
Latest thing I tried here was baked spaghetti with tomato sauce and fish, which sounds rather incongruous at a Chinese restaurant - but they do that in Hong Kong - and it is great  - better and cheaper than at 95% of Italian restaurants!

I really like this place, but not everything here is five star.  I much prefer the way some dishes are made at some of my other local Chinese favorites.  Some dishes here that I do NOT care for have been:  Singapore style rice noodles, ma po tofu, and chow fun.  On the other hand, some of my favorites here are the fish and ginger on rice(the basra fish is great in al the dishes), the spaghetti with the fish again, the eggplant with the ground pork, and bitter melon with beef, the Chinese vegetables with garlic, chow mein...Those just come to mind at the moment.

This is a very good and busy buffet.  Food tastes quite fresh and quite good.  Big selection and some good stuff - more when the price goes up, nights and weekends, but good all the time.  Sushi - which I'm usually afraid to try at Chinese buffets - is good and plentiful.

As mentioned below - and being as close as they are to the Phoenix megalopolis - they need to supervise the range very carefully - but even so, and as experienced as I am, the scene makes me very uncomfortable.  It can be very intimidating and a real turnoff to someone who is relatively new.

2 1/2 rounded down to 2 (elsewhere I'd give it a 3, but there is too much good competition around here)  I came here because my favorite, Hue Gourmet, was closed today, Wednesday.  I'm not a big fan of this place, neither here nor in Tucson.  Maybe it's because I haven't had their specialty, broken rice.  I did have pork soup.  Middling.

I think it's very Phogettable.  Tried their crab soup special which tasted more like some sort of spicy tomato concoction.  Where's the crab?  Also tried regular pho which was fairly mediocre.  Bowl not that big, broth not that tasty, ingredients merely OK, and it's not that cheap either, and there seemed to be an unpleasant aftertaste for some reason.

Update 1/12/12  Gave it another try because one feller on here said the egg noodle-wonton dish was the best thing he ate all year, and it was their special, so...  THAT was the best thing you ate all year!?  Pretty tasteless watery broth, and ingredients were pretty tasteless too, and sparse leaves, and over-priced - $8.50, I think it was - too.    1 1/2 rounded up to 2.

Great place.  Pho with brisket and tendon.  The broth is very good, the meat is also very good quality, and a lot of it, and it is cut very fine and nicely, and the noodles are very good too.  I was surprised how good it was because I am usually disappointed by hyped up places.  I also tried the oxtail pho and it was pretty good too, but my favorite was the first.  And the owner is an original and funny character all right.   I like her offbeat sense of humor.

Update:  Room still good, and night man at the desk was very friendly, BUT the morning  man at the desk - the owner? - very obnoxiously demanded ID before I could take any of his nasty breakfast coffee.  Unlike almost all of the other hotels in this chain this place offers no breakfast.  It has nothing but the crummy watery coffee.  Besides that, the little half and half packets were sour.  And then, upon checkout, they did the favorite trick of the disreputable motels in this chain, they try to slip in a phony "optional" charge, usually a "safe charge", like here, usually a dollar or two, but $3 here.  They will remove it if you ask them, but of course most people never notice it.

Just discovered this place, and I agree with the other rave reviews.  Terrific place, very friendly, most excellent food, and the prices are, if anything, much too cheap.  There is also a Greek grocery attached, also with great prices.    It's right next door to the Clarion Hotel, which is the best buy in Mesa, but don't tell anybody, because I don't want it to become too crowded.

Lo mein noodles with pork.  Too little noodles and lots of pork.  Odd.  Pork could have been good, but it was barely lukewarm.  Came with a little bowl of fish broth on the side.  Pretty crowded place.  Lots of the people are having soup and congee.  I see at least one other reviewer commenting on the lukewarm pork too, so it wasn't just this one time.

Combo duck and pig on rice.  Good, and nice large portion.  While it was good and I liked it I don't think the roast duck and roast pig are as special as others make it sound - well maybe it is for LV.  It tasted about the same as in any good Chinese deli, and I think some of my favorite places are even better.  Still, 4 stars and I'd definitely come here again. And I definitely liked it better than last year.

Very good.  It's the big semi-curtained off restaurant on the north end of the Mekong Plaza food mall hall, in case you're unfamiliar with the layout.  I'm rating it for the various takeout noodle dishes as I haven't tried the (very popular) dim sum yet.

They can be inconsistent.  Some dishes are excellent, but some dishes - like the beef chow fun and Singapore style chow mai fun I recently had - are not.  The beef chow fun was awful, tasteless and far too much bean sprouts.  Their wheat noodle dishes are good, and the rice noodle dish with shredded duck I just had was really good.  Yes, I like their noodle dishes.  The roast pig is excellent.   Their dim sum is extremely popular.  Interesting dishes too, like the fish maw soup - good.  Most of the time it's really good. I'd give them a five if they were more consistent.

Fish broth soup with fish flavored bean curd and tendon.  Broth OK but nothing special.  I do like the fact that they don't use MSG.  Hardly any tendon, and what there was of it was not at all good.  Didn't taste any of that fish flavor in the bean c.   It's not as bad as a 2 sounds...more like a 21/2, but there's a lot of competition around here.
