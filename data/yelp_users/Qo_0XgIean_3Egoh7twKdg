Went here almost everyday while in Vegas, to play keno.  Loved their keno hall the most.    Now we are be connected members and they are very generous with giving out comps! We are considering going back, sooner than later.  Never stayed in the hotel though.

Omg where to start. Original margarita: so this tasted weird.  Had a weird taste at the end.  Well it has fresh lime juice, you know when you drink ok and it's going bad, you get that tang.  This has that taste.  Yuck.  So I went to a mojito instead, this was good. Chips and salsa costs here, guess I'm spoiled.  Chips are "fresh". Yet we had a bunch that were stale, from the previous night? Rice and beans were good but their blue corn tortillas for cheese enchiladas were very hard.  Wasn't a fan at all. Service was ok but this place was very over priced and weird. Please don't think this is Mexican food people.

Yes it is a little over priced, but the food is huge portions, so go in looking to share, and tastes amazing.  Went in last week for my birthday. I had the  chicken and it was huge, cooked perfectly with lots of veggies and mashed potatoes.  I have celiacs and they helped me out with making sure my dish was gluten free.  I was happy.   Husband had a burger, per usual. He had a beer while I had a cocktail.  Pricing wasn't too bad, because let's be honest I've paid much more for far less and much worse. Service was just ok, a little slow.   But I'd recommend and I'd come back

Went here just to play bingo.   The lady's calling numbers is quick and sometimes hard to hear.  My husband, who loved bingo until we played here, couldn't understand her and kept asking me what she said.   Yes very smoky, like most older places in Vegas.   2 free drinks per player before the games start and someone comes around during e game too. Won't come back, it's a locals place.  I'll go to the Orleans instead

I got stranded in AZ last week after missing my connecting flight.  I was so upset.  They gave me a voucher for a discounted room and I picked up the phone and just called the first hotel on the list since Aloft starts with A I called them.  They had openings and had  sent a van to pick me up.  WOW Loved the rooms, very chic, very comfortable.  and they hooked me up with free bottles of water and a tooth brush and tooth paste.  I wish I was there longer than 10 hours it was very nice.  I will look into staying at one in the near future.
