My experience entailed an absolutely amazing waitress she did everything right and was extremely pleasant. My food.. Over 60 minute ticket time, under cooked steak and a sent back soup. Super under portioned as well.    Great service. Over priced. Food at Tilted Kilt up stairs is the same quality and cheaper.  I wouldn't waste your time, Fox Concepts let me down consistently.

(Awesome location for quick cut and shave before hitting the nightlife)   May cut my hair and did a superb job on it, was completely satisfied with the end result and still am two weeks after!   Got a nose hair wax while I was there and it was quick and painless. (never had one before but May highly recommend it). Guys try it out, seriously!   And she trimmed and lined me beard perfectly!   Chairs are comfy and the whole staff is professional and relaxed. Great waiting area with TV and refreshments. They even provide clean shirts to change in and out of while your getting a cut.
