Very good chicken fried steak. Okra. And mashed potatoes. Makes great leftovers if you can't finish!

We came out on a Saturday night. We understand it is busy and there is going to be a wait. We checked in with our name, party of two, was told it was going to be about a 30 min wait, got our pager, and waited outside since the lobby/foyer was crowded. There were a few parties waiting outside too.   40 minutes have passed, we came inside and checked to see the status of where our name was. Apparently our pager was dead, they called our name 10-15 minutes ago. We were put off by the manager/supervisor's attitude, he was really rude.  He made it seem like it was our fault we didn't hear our names called because we were standing right outside and that our pager was dead. I saw that they were calling names inside and outside, but the only called outside every other time.   This kind customer service at the beginning set the mood for the evening...not fun. We always try to have a positive attitude, but it was kind of sad when someone that is representing the restaurant is not welcoming, we didn't really want to be there anymore. We stayed though because we are not rude.   They did seat us about a minute after.  Our waiter was awkward too, but he tried.   We always like to come out here to have our favorite appetizer and dessert. We live 30 min away, so we like to make night of it when we decide to come out.

My husband and I have purchased from The Roomstore before and were pleased. It was time for us to buy a new sectional, and we had gone to Mor, Ashley and Roomstore. Most of the designs we liked were at the Roomstore. We had a great experience this second time. Our sales person was Assistant Manager, Mary. She was fantastic! Mind you this is on a Sunday. Our sectional was in stock. She included free same day delievery. Our purchase process was easy. We had our new sectional in our home before 3:00 PM on the same day. :-) Very happy.

I have had to change my review from 5 to 2 because the last few times I have gone my steak has not been cooked correctly. It is disappointing, but this place is still ok for the view.

I love Chipotle. The reason for the 2 stars is because of the staff. They seemed unorganized, inefficient, and unprofessional. Most of the other locations are very efficient and organized, especial around a busy lunch time. Before starting down the line, I saw 2 containers we empty (veggies & cheese). When it was my turn I had to wait about 5 minutes for them to make veggies. Normally, when you see an item getting low, it is being prepared and then placed in a clean new container. They were preparing the veggies and then poured them in the old container that had been empty in the filling station. Then one check out it seemed the person asking what else you'd like had to told a few times what you wanted because he seemed kind of spacey and not there. Overall, my first uneasy and weird at a Chipotle.

I gave this place a 2nd chance for breakfast. Apparently, when you ask for not tomatoes you get them anyways. :-/ I'm never going back there again

We had our company holiday party last night! I was so awesome! The Duce staff was very good and helpful. The bartenders rocked it. And the food was awesome! We had the Duce Dip and Strawberry bruschetta, mac'n'cheese muffins, brisket sliders, chicken sausage sliders, duce salad, and finished with shake shots, pumpkin pie, and s'mores pie! It was a nice place to visit, listen to great music, watch swing dancers, and to have fun! Thank you The Duce! :-)

My husband and I ate here tonight to try something new. We were not impressed. I was hoping the zucchini appetizer would have been made fresh, but it seems it comes pre-made. I got the fettuccine alfredo with chicken, it wasn't great but ok. My husband got spaghetti and meatballs. About an hour after we ate, he got an upset stomach. :-(

I love this place! I went with a few friends after work. I had 2 modern cocktails, Don Quiotex (sp?) and Jameson and the Giant Peach. The bartender, Chris, and the waiter was very nice. We got to me the chef, Jorge. I can't wait to go back!

First time visiting The Green Gurl today! I was in search of a party dress for a holiday party. I ended up leaving with a dress, 3 pairs of shoes, and unicorn band aids. I love all the styles of retro clothes, shoes, and accessories! I can't wait to go back!

Great lunch and happy hour spot! We went with a group of 12 from work. Service was very fast, especially for a large group. I had the steak plate, very good. I love all the different sauces. I love the treat bar! I got the fruity pebble crispy treat!
