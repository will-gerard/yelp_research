The food is very tasty. The restaurant is clean. The beer is priced very well and includes local brews. The radio station IS THE BEST!!!! Its good for groups in a semi private room with a scary clown ride!

The grocery store here is fantastic!  There are also some tasty restaurant s! Parking can be a little bit complicated sometimes but don't let that discourage you.  I prefer to go during off peak hours because there's a lot of items packed into this place.

Wellll first time here. Probably the last. Been here 45 minutes. Food hasnt arrived. Asked the server about it. he had to ask what we ordered with a look on his face like we never ordered anything.  We ordered the brussel sprouts no almonds due to a huge food allergy. We shall see how that turns out.   Otherwise the atmosphere is nice.  Sigh...
