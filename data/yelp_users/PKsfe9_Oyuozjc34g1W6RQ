I love that we can watch summertime favorites for free with all the kids and on Tuesdays you get $2 drinks and popcorn. But I hate that the theater smells like pee :( really throws off the experience.

I can assure you the five stars is not because of our waiter tonight. The acts were great. Love going here to see comedy shows. However the waiter left a little more than something to be desired. He talked us into the unlimited sodas telling us it's cheaper than getting two drinks. He brought us our two sprites and then I was hardly able to waive him down to give him the paper you can fill out with your information, although I saw him a time or two. Then I was more than halfway thru my sprite and he was no where to be found. I kept drinking figuring he would bring us another. He never did. I honestly kept looking for him. But he didn't show up until he brought the bill. And it was for $27.43!!!!!!!!  $3+ of that was the already added gratuity. That's $3 he didn't earn!!  As he handed it to me I said to him "you never even brought us another drink!" He told me he was always around and he watched our drinks but didn't want to bother us and we never asked for another....I was completely appalled because then he said "well, it is a two drink minimum anyway so...." Then he offered to bring us both another sprite. Even though it was the end of the show basically! At this point I still hadn't looked at the bill and I was already upset that he had made himself scarce and had tricked us. Then I saw the amount and lost it! Who pays $27 for 2 sprites? And they were supposed to be unlimited because he said that was the best way to go. And he said he would check back in with us but as I said he never did! I went and spoke with a manager then because I felt played. The manager agreed that it sounded like he had ripped us off and offered to take care of the bill for us and then gave me his managers card and told me to email him and we would be given free tickets to another show. I feel that Tempe Improv doesn't deserve to have less than 5 stars despite this bad waiter who didn't do his job! We will be back no matter what. Just hope to not come across this waiter again.

Went there yesterday hoping to get a couple salads for lunch. Had their own coupon to buy one menu item and get one free. However since our one lesser meal was less than $6 they couldn't figure out how to take the coupon off. They kept trying to get us to order something else instead of a salad! Over and over we told them we just wanted salads not a different more expensive menu item. I don't understand how the manager couldn't even figure out how to give us the discount. We ended up leaving and going some where else instead.

Go there whenever life gets away from me and I need to have a fresh juice or a protein shake. Always the greatest service there. Love the owners too! This is my go to place to feel better :)

Never a dull experience when we go here. Comfy and clean is just as important as the movie we are seeing. Went for an Allstate Free movie and giveaway experience. Popcorn was fresh and buttery. People are friendly too.

Thought the people were super nice. We skipped the groupon and they matched the price, however, I really feel like the guy did a less than stellar job based off what I was paying. I went in there with split ends and said I needed them cut off. He spent a couple mins cutting and then jumped right into drying. I thought maybe he was drying to see what else needed cut and then we were talking and I liked how it was looking in the mirror. I left thinking he did a nice job styling my hair. First time I washed and dried it though I notice just how many split ends I still have. And not just in the middle of my head in the layers, but at the ends! I suppose it is just as much my fault for not completely checking when I left, but he really should have tried to gain a new customer by doing just as good of a job as he would for a full paying customer. I had never been to this salon before and now I will never go back.

Service here was really good. Food was pretty good also. Been trying to find the one place we can always go to for great Mexican food! I am not sure this will be the place, but since it could have been an off day I will be going back so I can get them a fair shot. I just want a crunchy chimichanga.

First time we ever ordered our food came an hour later than it was supposed to. When we called they got angry instead of apologetic. Then we found out the manager wasn't even around. They even hung up on me!   Our food finally showed up and it was cold and gross and also got the order wrong!!! So I stopped by after we finished working and the manager still wasn't there. So I complained to whoever was there and they were a little nicer but still condescending and it turned out to be the guy I talked to on the phone that hung up on me. He said that he thought the conversation was over, however I was still talking and he just hung up. I told him I didn't appreciate being hung up on when I was trying to contain my frustration and wasn't being rude at all and finally agreed to give me a voucher for the same amount we initially paid. However they left such a bad taste in my mouth I never went back to use the voucher. It was not our fault at all that they delivered the food late and cold, and wrong! And it wasn't just about the order mess up, it was the way they handled it or lack of handling it. Won't be trying them ever again.

Great donuts that are super fresh and delish every time!!! Always able to quickly get what we need and get out. Not the biggest selection of donuts but they always have our favorites!

Great burgers EVERY SINGLE TIME! We love their Cajun fries and always split a triple burger making the cost well worth it. Love the free peanuts they give you while you wait too. Restaurant has always been clean every time we have gone there.

Not only was the food EXCELLENT!!! So was the customer service. From the moment we walked in the door we felt welcomed. We weren't sure what we were going to order so we sat down with a menu to decide and a gentleman came over after giving us a moment to look over the menu and helped us to decide what we would like to order. I had the fish sandwich, my husband had the fish and clams and my daughter ordered the shrimp. She loved her food too and she is super picky. This is definitely a place we will be returning to over and over as a favorite.

The atmosphere and food here is so great that we have been there almost once a week since discovering them back in February. We have told everyone we can about them! Unfortunately not every experience has been that great, a waitress there on the bar side has left something to be desired on two occasions. She brought my husband thoroughly burnt toast (it was BLACK) and then not even once came back to see how we were doing. So we went without drink refills and everything until she brought the check. However we didn't let this discourage us from coming back. We tried Fried Pickles for the first time ever and they were super yummy! Their chicken fried steak is delish and my hubby just tried the chili omelet and loved it! We will be back. Over and over again!

I am starting to see the reason why we never have a wait when going to this restaurant. While the food is decent, the wait staff is severely lacking in orders and memory! Last time the waitress screwed up our order several times, and this time the same thing happened. Also last time they couldn't figure out our Groupon like they had never done it before. Nothing horrible, but she brought hash browns instead of potatoes and then my eggs were cold. I ordered an extra meal to go and she messed that up too thinking I ordered just eggs. Then someone else brought our meal minus the potatoes and she messed up the eggs again!! I am not planning to return unfortunately.
