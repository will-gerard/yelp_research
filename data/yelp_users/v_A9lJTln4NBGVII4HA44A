As we are new to Gilbert area I looked up on "yelp" for a dentist.  We have "Delta Dental" so I made sure they accept our insurance, with our policy we can get free cleaning twice a year.  The lady on the phone told me "no problem, we take Delta and you will not have to pay any extras"  I thought great.  We ended having extra charges, but I am fixing my review to 4 stars since Dr Jacobsen took responsibility and honor their original quote and accept our insurance.  I recommend as a lesson for other ppl who have dental insurance to check with their insurance provider as well as the dentist they choose what's the exact coverage so they won't have extra unexpected charges.

I absolutely loved it.  I didn't sit down at the place to eat, I called and picked up from the restaurant.  I got the House Salad and a large pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni.  Very enjoyed it. 5 stars because the dough and flavor definitely at the highest standards for Pizza.  Definitely will order again

My first time here and we had a great time!  I am actually surprised by the poor reviews by a lot of ppl, I paid attention most of them because one visit and about specific waiters.  I think when you review a restaurant give them a poor rating just because you run into a bad waiter one time is a little bit funny.  We really enjoyed our food, we got the bread with cheese & marinara sauce and spaghetti with a meat sauce and they both were really good and above expectations.  The waitress was new and wasn't very knowledgeable, but she really tried and was very very nice.  And wow the price?? Everything for $24 plus tip??? It's unbeatable!!  I think all this people who rate a restaurant need to pay attention to how much they paying too!  To go to a restaurant who charges you $30 for two people and compares it to one who charges $100 and rate it as you paid the same is not right.  I really felt like the price & quality is above my expectations and by far!

I love the concept  You get a table covered with Paper and different choices for sea food...  I am sure you can get enough information here what's this place is about...  I would say the sauce is very yummy and the food cook very nice served in a plastic bag, so yeaaaaaa you get dirty, I LOVE IT...  my favorites are:  *** Shrimps  *** Muscles  *** bag of vegetables    B.S I ordered the Lobster before and not recommend it, its expensive and it come full size (you pay by pound) the best part is the tail and its just about 20% of what you pay for... also its come full size and its a lot of work to have it ready to eat...  But this place is on my TOP list for sea food around the area

a lot a lot of troubles with this company and all I recommend is to stay away.  almost anything is troubling when you deal with that insurance company.  starts from the most simple thing to make a payment for your monthly premium, continuing to try to use it they rejected the doctor visit portion bill.  when you try to contact them it takes forever, FOREVER I am talking about over two hours wait to just ask a simple question.  now I found out their permission to sell policies for 2016 is suspended. not surprising  STAY AWAY, DAMMMMM
