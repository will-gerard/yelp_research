Horrible pharmacy customer service!!! .. Everytime I'm here I get some type off runaround that seems like it's almost out of something personal because of my tattoos and image.  Last time it took 3 hours! After being told "one more hour"  3 times! Now this time I bring the same script I bring to other Walgreens for years and they want some kind of diagnosis code for extra verification. Basically saying I'm a suspect of fraud. The Asian manager guy literally said before I even opened my mouth  "2 hour wait... If you don't like it you can go somewhere else"  Wwwoooowwwww

Love this place! Always friendly staff and clean vibe. I come here often and is my favorite yogurt joint in the Valley
