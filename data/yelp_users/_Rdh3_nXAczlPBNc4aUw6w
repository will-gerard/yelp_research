I had already wrote a review for the Grill in North Scottsdale, but this was my first time at the Biltmore location.  It is safe to assume that everything was an exemplary five star experience.  Was with a group, so we all ordered the signature Stoli Doli martini which was shaken so well that there was slight frost crystals floating on the top.  Great balance of Stoli and pineapple.  We all loved them!  Bread basket came out with pumpernickel and raisin, cheese onion and of course the lavash.    We all shared so the lamb medium rare excellent as well as the tuna served with 4 different sauces.  Perfect rare sear with the sauces some being spicy, one being soy and two others that unfortunately I didn't get to try do to my compatriots pounding the tune :)  Now of course one has to have the dessert.  So three were ordered-  first the flour less chocolate cake, always so phenomenal, especially if you like dark chocolate that isn't over sweetened.  The second dessert was the coconut cream pie that was remarkably good and lastly the cheesecake with berry side.  Instead of describing them in detail its sufficient to say less  than three minutes not one damn crumb remained of anything.  Service was A+ and made sure we were well taken care of.

This might be a shorter review then most buy went in for a hair cut and the barber was friendly and asked me a few questions on how I wanted my cut  Good hair cut and good shave with the straight razor on the back of my neck.  Priced right, friendly people and good hair cut.

Okay guys, you do a decent job with the clothes but my biggest complaint is when I ask how much the difference between the Diamond and Silver service is, give me a straight answer.  Had a few of my items that I needed pressed and requested the hand ironing service with the "Silver".  How does a shirt cost $8.00 to hand iron--mind you no laundry or dry cleaning, just simply pressing the darn thing.  I had asked initially about pricing and when I picked up the bill was way different then what I had spoken to the girl about.  The explanation....get ready for this...  " some shirts require extra work or since the buttons are more delicate it's charged at the Diamond rate".    Well if your going to arbitrarily charge more for again, just a normal launder or simple hand iron one must mention that when asked, not just "tack it on".  So I don't know if Z Cleaners knows but there are several more reasonably priced places, oh within about 1/2 mile that will do a better job and not price gouge a customer at pick up.

This review is strictly about the dessert and not any of the menu items.  I see so many 5 stars and I guess if you would want average desserts that load up the sugar and chocolate sauces to mask the flavor then hey this is the 5 star place for you!  Had their Godiva cheesecake and since I wanted something with WOW chocolate decided on the chocolate blackout cake.  Now, would one except a dark chocolate almost slightly bitter taste of real cocoa when ordering the Godiva Dark Chocolate?  Or instead how about just giving a really over sweetened chocolate cheese cake with no real homemade texture that may perchance resemble a taste similar to Hershey's ?    Chocolate Blackout Cake- increase the portion size to feed 3 people, decrease the quality of the ingredients and add again the sweet chocolate syrup with an almost artificial chocolate taste upon the cake that is like a box mix.  Voila...charge $9.00 for equivalent of Betty Crocker box cake!  Don't mean to go hard on the CF, but most of their menu items on their appetizer side and small plates are fried (one or two healthy ones only), and again from what I see, if you want a ton of food for not a lot of money then sure its great.  I haven't tried their entrees yet, but am a bit hesitate to do so.  Just don't want to set myself up for disappointment.  For the service side- seen the same service issues everyone else talks about.  For some reason these corporate chains either hire managers who don't know what they heck they are doing, or decide to offer a pay scale so low that no one takes the job seriously and could care less if they work there or not.  How about pay a few more dollars per hour and hire people who take their job seriously?  And find a real manager, which again might cost a few more dollars but could be worth it.

I'm probably thinking what everyone else is thinking- reviewing a grocery chain??    One of my favorite things about this store is the seafood area- not because of the variety or presentation (both okay) but the employees keep that area so clean it's unreal.  At the end of the nite its spotless.  And for me that means people care about the job start to finish.  So what needs to change- imagine this.....the deli area had fresh salads.  I noticed that the olives in the olive bar looked way fresher than the deli salad with the black olives.  So I asked why the difference.  Well as it turns out the ingredients used in the supposedly "fresh" salads COME IN PRE MADE!!!    WTF- you have the freshest vegetables right in front of you and you use prepackaged produce??  Yeas it seems like to much effort in the section that is named " deli fresh" that something is actually fresh (don't even go there with no homegrown representation ).   Now I don't want to hear from any corporate accounting types that "economy of scale" or it makes sense "because of the volume" to use other than fresh ingredients.  Isn't that what a deli is all about?  Really Safeway you can't even make a fresh salad at a store but want to dump mediocre quality from a bag and mix it up?  My suggestion like I do every time I'm there is tell the manager over and over again to force change for better quality and better standards.  And lastly, for a long time Safeway had their fresh roasted nuts and homemade peanut butter.  Great as it should be.  Sadly a "corporate" decision eliminated the fresh roasted nuts and peanut butter.  But don't worry shoppers, Safeway still has mass produced "Jiffy" peanut butter with great home additives you need a chemistry degree to interpret and fresh roasted nuts in a bag with a shelf life of 2+ years.  After all why buy fresh and homemade when you can have prepackaged, chemically added, corporate margin friendly food items.

Here we refer back to the old adage "if you charge a premium for something, deliver the same value as you charge".  Why does places think that since your in "Scottsdale" you can just throw something together and it will work?  Old theater with seats that literally if your short (like my significant other) you have a hard time seeing over someone.  Like other reviews mention- no stadium style seating.  And...don't expect the nice large screens like Studio or IPic.  Nope, and in a few years they might be in danger of having LCD's at Costco rival Harkins  for screen size :)  So Harkins people, invest in your business and bring it up to standard.  What might make this happen since there is obviously unhappy customers out there is people start going to other theaters.  Take your dollars and spend them where a business puts in effort, modernizes and gives value for what they are charging.  Or...offer 1/2 off what normal theaters charge

Wow!  I went there thinking I knew what an espresso tasted like, with a benchmark from only Starbucks as the norm.  Now I've had some great coffees around the country from places like these but one soon forgets how a great fresh roast tastes.  Had the Espresso Con Panna, which I have to say was blissful.  Freshness, balance of the espresso and the cream with a hint of sugar was perfect.  Roasting your own coffee and grinding it fresh does wonders for the taste.    My significant other had the Iced Chai which again was amazing.  Great flavors and you actually taste different spices vs. the norm of a glorified over sweet one note Chai.  Will definitely be back and glad there are still businesses that take the time and pride themselves on a delicious product.  Also other pluses...free wi-fi, great atmosphere with local artists and super friendly staff.  So next time, why Starbucks???

I don't give out 5 stars unless everything is perfect start to finish.  Congrats Capital Grill as I wouldn't have wanted one thing different.  The first thing that came out was the bread basket that had lavash, onion and pumpernickel with raisin bread.  All really really good and served perfectly warm.  Fiancée ordered a salad, but let's not focus on that.  After all if you go to the Capital Grill, a salad should't be on your radar screen.  So ordered the porcini rubbed rib eye steak.  What can you say about perfection?  Served a perfect medium rare with the porcini rub and Cabernet hint in the sauce worked so well I could have ordered another one!!  Sides of mashed potatoes which were delicious and the asparagus cooked perfectly!  Matt the bartender paid attention to every little detail and recommended the seven layer chocolate cake.  Now not a dessert guy at all.  But who ever made that cake, stop by our house anytime to use our kitchen!!  A deliciously executed dessert that had cake and ganache with a vanilla creme glacé.  Trust me order this and you will be hooked.

What can I say- who doesn't like saving money.  So here are my money saving, awesome deal, scrumptious, yummy, down right darn good and cool stuff you need to check out:  Wine aisle- So Costco has everything from Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc on sale (as of this post $10.16 per bottle, which is by far the cheapest around) to an off the hook first growth Chateau Haute Brion.  Did you say Argentina, France, US, Italy?  Don't for get the Port from Portugal.  Spirit aisle-  Who in their right mind wouldn't want a 3.5 gallon of Patron Silver Tequila?   Okay, exaggerating a bit there, but 750ML is perfect.  And again can you say $11,000- yes $11,000 bottle of Scotch?  Check that off your list.  And don't forget to visit with Jimmy, Jack, Jose, Johnny,Don and the others!  Seafood tastiness- Crab that is that huge for only $20.00 per pound?  Precooked and big as something off Deadliest Catch.  Bakery- Today they had pumpkin pie, a fruit tart, a super chocolaty huge a$$ cake and other stuff that makes you say "Yummo".  Samples- yes i got hooked in on some fresh flat breads that were off the hook.  So sample away, eat away and spend away!!  Cheese in 40 lb blocks- Okay, exaggerating again but good quality cheeses at bulk prices you can't beat.    Socks/Underwear and Tee's.  Let's face it, buying Ralph Lauren underwear is literally..ah let's not got there, but for the basics, gym socks, gym shorts, gym t shirts or gym anything this is the proverbial one stop shop.  Medjool Dates-  hmmmm, okay I tried it and loved it and where else can you get them without paying the equivalent of your cable bill?    So in short, Costco rocks, people are cool, parking sorta sucks sometimes but hey your saving a S&!% load of money so you can't complain.

The first time I had tried this place about a year ago (pre yelp) I wasn't that impressed.  So I thought I'd give it another try just for the health of it.  WOW- very impressed with everything across the board.  Let's start with the 2 pasta dishes myself and significant other had.  Pesto- okay, so Picazzo's emphasizes fresh, healthy ingredients and sometimes one trades off flavor for the natural organic options.  This was so not the case as the pesto pasta that had delicious home made pasta was complimented by sun dried tomatoes and goat cheese which gave a perfect balance to the pesto sauce.  I did throw in some crushed red peppers for some heat and a small dash of salt, but no complaints but compliments on this dish.  Significant other had the Shrimp Scampi.  Now usually Scampi is drowning in an over buttery sauce.  Here again, homemade pasta with the perfect combo of olive oil and butter with lemon and capers (which I assume the good saltiness came from).  Had the usual Jack and Coke and the bartender Nick actually came over to make sure the drink was the way I liked it.  The second one was even better...thanks Nick!!!!!  Will definitely be back to try their other delicious items.    Service of course was excellent, place was warm and inviting.  Great job guys!

I feel odd leaving a 2 star review when so many people really love this place.  So ordered 2 entrees- the gnocchi in a vodka cream sauce and the penne with veal ragu.  So I'm wondering what went wrong here....the gnocchi was just plain tasting, no pizzaz to the sauce, no hint of any real flavors except tomato sauce that seemed watered down.  It was good but for $16 or $17 dollars I sort of expected above average.  Now the veal penne- pasta was cooked perfectly.  And it stops there....the sauce was not enough to really cover or be spread around all the noodles and again, where was that veal taste with hints or spice, tomatoes etc?  Missing like the gnocchi.  Had to ask for a side of Parmesan since the pasta was lacking even a good sprinkling of cheese.  Bread was slightly cold, not warm so great, can it get more annoying.....  So at that point I thought a homemade piece of tiramisu would do the trick.  Okay at this point I said "you have to be "bleeping" kidding me."  I would say it was an order of whipped cream with some lady fingers included.  Literally 65% whipped cream that was actually good, won't take that away from them, but the dessert isn't a moose, it's lady fingers.  Tasted the mascarpone cheese, but no taste of coffee liquor, or anything but mascarpone whipped cream.  So disappointed and even more disappointed it costs over $50.00 (had 2 glasses of wine, in small glasses) what tastes slightly better than the Olive Gardens.    And don't charge $7.00 for whipped cream!!!!

If your looking and searching for a perfect pizza place that emphasizes minimal clutter to maximize taste then this is it!  Let's start with my fav's.  The prosciutto pizza.  And how does Hanny's pull off one of the better pizzas in the valley simply with great dough, sauce and cheese, on top of  delicious prosciutto (very generous helping I may add), arugula and parmigiana cheese?  Just know what you specialize in, keep the quality and freshness high and know how to bake a great pie.     For a side I have always ordered the asparagus with a fried egg and you guessed it, shaved Parmesan cheese!  Asparagus is always crunchy, egg cooked perfectly and to finish it off the cheese and a sprinkle of black pepper.    Liked the Gorgonzola slaw, which the cheese does add to the taste but $7.00 for coleslaw that is basically good coleslaw with Gorgonzola is a tad bit over priced.  Lastly, had the Prosciutto shrimp.  Okay I must be on some Prosciutto kick but when it's fresh sliced off right in front of you, tender and lean, one will agree that it's probably the thing to bring some joy to the day!.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly with,  you guessed it arugula and Parmesan cheese as garnish.     And before  I forget, let's talk cocktails!  Hanny's takes you back to the old gangster era with Absinthe, Chartreuse and of course their 1940's inspired cocktails.  They make a damn good Old Fashion, with a solid pour and a wallet friendly $9.00 price tag.  Oh yeah- and that means two of them for me!  My significant other loves wine and had the Sean Miner Pinot Noir, which is good and moderately priced.  Overall a great experience the many times I went and one must check out the basement (yes, just do it) and the restrooms (can't give any clues but very neat).

Not a big fan of chain restaurants but since it was late and I did want Italian I figured what the heck  I tell you what, wasn't disappointed in the slightest.  Started off with the lentil soup.  Why lentil soup?  Because I'm wondering how an Italian themed restaurant can make better soup than a proclaimed middle eastern place- yes Pita Jungle.  The soup was fantastic with a hint of spice, lots of lentils and unlike Pita Jungle, no overbearing cilantro taste.  Entree was the surf and turf, which includes a perfectly cooked fillet and lobster ravioli.  Obviously the fillet was the highlight but the ravioli was good as well.  For once no beverages except water but do like the idea of their happy hour that has half priced apps!!  Service was up to par as was the overall feel of the place.

One thing about Starbucks is that they are always consistent in the beverages.  So if you are reading this review and have never been to a Starbucks we'll I can't help you there.  My iced coffee (venti of course) was perfect and two pumps of classic syrup added the just right amount of sweetness.  Not that I drink this 4-5 days per week!!

Now this review is based on benchmarking Talking Stick against other casinos taking into account this isn't Vegas  First Talking Stick people, if your going to say your a destination place, and offer live music, how about having more than 30 sole seats and about only 10 tables.  So no where to sit remotely close, no problem I'll just find another lounge.  Wait a minute, there seems to be a shortage of lounges or any other type of live music.  How about just another place to sit and chill?  Walked around and only seen a short row of booths with small tables across from Ocean Trail.  Ocean Trail did you say?  Yes stood in line for 25 minutes with no acknowledgement from any staff.  Finally asked for $18.75 for gumbo, which I can't ever seem to recall anyone anywhere charging that much, I asked if all the gumbo and étouffée was made today.  Staff member wasn't sure.  So congrats but I won't stand in line for 25 minutes, pay $18.00 for gumbo that might not have fresh seafood that day.  Just had a cocktail and moved on.  So heard there was a night club on the 15th floor with live music.  Off again and find the elevators.  Two door guys and a security guard maybe didn't understand that being my first time here, I asked for the lounge that had music.  Three questions later, are you eating?  No drinking!  Where did you want to go?  Beats the hell out of me, refer to first answer.  Here for Sky something or Orange Crush? Hmmm, again great question if I knew what either place was.  So they said go up to the 15th floor.  Basically wound up on the 14th floor, security person asks for my bracelet?  (Seriously?). Bracelet for liquor laws- sure here is my ID.  Trust me I look 21 years over 21.  Nope having an ID wasn't good enough I guess.  Another example of making your policies more important than a guest trying to just have a drink at your bar.  I'll go back down guys And I'll go down to the parking garage and I'll keep going!  Lastly, charge a decent amount for drinks but don't just throw it together and not really care about the flavor of the drink.  I asked for a Jack D that didn't have to much coke and to make sure I taste the Jack.  Did the bartender really try to do anything different than measure which seemed a tad short of Jack and squirted way to much Coke in the glass?  Nope  Okay, so no real entertainment, overpriced food and substandard drinks.  Add in that no one really cares about the customers over their rules/regulations that I've never seen in any other casino- it adds up to just going somewhere else.

CPH for short has always delivered an exceptional dining experience from beginning to end.  This visit I strayed from the norm- the must try Scallops that are 4 huge scallops with a side of corn grits (yes it works trust me), some greens and what gives it that pop or taste is the homemade cola reduction that is drizzled on.  This is by far one of my top scallop dishes ever tasted.  But for this evening, we (the fiancee) got there early and took advantage of the happy hour.  The rosemary salted nuts where good and flavor was great.  Order the fondue which came with a nice side of break and some jerky.  Cheese was great and didn't become to hot like some places that have to much heat underneath the cheese.  Final appetizer was the pork belly pastrami.  Again, nailed it with layers of flavor, even from the slight hint of mustard at the end.  Not to mention a very tender pork belly.  Next the chopped salad which I've had at least 5 times.  Won't go into detail but the ingredients are so different they have their own Facebook page!   Entrees for me was the Fair Trade Short Ribs and my significant other just had the macaroni and cheese side.  Short Ribs where good, maybe 30 seconds less on the cooking for me- which is a personal preference.  I'm not a fan of parsnip puree, but the texture and flavor was great.  My significant other's mac and cheese was huge.  Lots of cheese flavor and lots of noodles.  For me it needed a "pop" of something but I can't place it.    Last, but not least, they do know how to serve a decent cocktail.  I've complained before how restaurants want to charge but not deliver, but CPH gives a real drink with real flavors.  Try their Manhattan if you like whiskey and you'll be sure to love house made bitters with the orange and cherry twist.  My fiancee had the Mia Margarita which had some nice hints of lemon and lime with a surprise salt rim that had a smokey taste.

Beautiful park that has ample parking, activities and scenery.  Although it's weird leaving a review for a park but since I'm here sweating my @$$ off after a run I figured let everyone know this is a cool place  And no, tennis is 105 degrees is not on the agenda :)

For not being a dessert guy and a huge meat guy (could never understand this veggie vegan thing) Nami had some darn good desserts that weren't over sweet and had flavors that I don't normally taste in desserts.  Had a coffee and the donuts (vegan ones at that) and the fiancé ordered some chocolate cookie.  Actually for something very simply prepared the taste was really good.  The coffee tasted spot on with a good balance of bitterness and smoothness (put 2 sugars and just a splash of what I assume was cream)  So if your vegetarian or want a dessert that doesn't overload you with processed sugars, hydrogenated oils and other crap that is in most bulk desserts, check this place out.

You just have to be in the mood for popcorn, and after vising Popcorn Kitchen, I'm in the mood so much more often.  I've only had four of the over 20+ flavors, but here is what I can tell you about those four....(yes I went a little nuts but your'll understand)  Sonoran Blend- What I loved is the Sonoran Blend combined the taste of popcorn with suble spices, a bit of sweetness and a surprise kick of spice at the end.  Some bites you really had it, some just a bit.  Talk about addictive, I killed the whole damn bag in 1 hour.  Must try this one!  Cashew with Chocolate-  Man, what if you combine delicious Cashews with rich dark chocolate.  The salty/sweet combination is a perfect balance.  A dessert popcorn that I really, really enjoyed.  Buttery-  There are a few things you can't have to much of in life, and a good butter flavor is one of them.  Not greasy, but the taste of salt with butter was awesome.  Cheddar-  So second thing you can't have to much of in life is cheese.  And again, the cheese had perfect balance with just a tad of saltiness.    So instead of reading about how good this is, head on over and be adventurous and order little bags of different flavors.  Meaning, if you want plain popcorn go to the movies, if you want awesome flavors for a different experience you found the place!

Okay corporate people, here is another example of "I don't know why anyone gave this a 4-5 star review" place.  Now if you have quick food on the go, and charge a fair amount for the items, at least try to make it not focused on hydrogenated oil and sugar and the cornerstone ingredients.   So I tried the Mongolian.  Which is suppose to be beef with a barbecue sauce, with scallions and mushrooms.  Okay, how about over cooked beef, with a sugary sauce that was suppose to pass for a soy BBQ sauce.  Way to much sugar, way to much time cooking it.    My fiancee had Ginger Broccoli which is in theory suppose to have broccoli with a sweet soy sauce, scallions and ginger.  One couldn't taste the ginger over the over sweet soy sauce (again the damn sugar and oil combo).  In terms of ginger, couldn't taste or see it and ditto for any other flavors except corn syrup with soy sauce to generously poured over much over cooked broccoli.  Pei Wei, take some notes from the playbook of other custom made to order fast food places and focus on freshness and wholesome ingredients.  You might have some repeat customers (now who in the heck would want that).

My first 5 star review and you'll see why  Fiancée and I wanted to try this as I'm all about what you can do with meat.  Grabbed a seat at the bar and immediately had a menu and two waters.  Bartender help my girl out with her mixed drink which was a ginger tequila.  Not a tequila guy but darn did that taste great.  Bartender definitely took his time making it and could tell he cared how everything was.  Now of course I went for the apocalypse "sow" which made this a 5 star review.  Very tender pork burger, homemade aioli and of course bacon and cheese.  Not much else but not much else was needed.  The spices and tenderness said it all.  Served with a side of homemade fries that were perfect.  Fiancé had the shrimp and grits.  She loved it, Looked awesome, ample size but I was so focused on my burger I was full by the time I thought about a bite.    Will I be back? You bet....Will I be back this week?  You bet!

Okay, how about if your "closed" you let someone know your closed???  Leave a message on the voicemail, post something on your website, let Yelp know, smoke signals, anything....otherwise someone will drive expecting a decent slice of pizza and low and behold- denied!!!  Also one of my pet peeves is when a restaurant is going to close, why don't you, as a restaurant owner, say your closing?  Telling everyone your "closed for  renovations" while literally the place is cleared out accomplishes what?  It's obvious the place is closed, thus the posting on the door, and there isn't one item left of the original place.  Hopefully another great pizza place will be moving in.....only one can hope

I've tried just about every smoothie available on the menu and I haven't had anything I can honestly say wasn't good, refreshing or delicious (usually a combination of all three).  My fav to try would be the energy elevator, which has espresso, whey proteing, almond milk, cocoa and a few other goodies I can't remember right now.  Taste like an espresso drink with a hint of chocolate.  Not sweet at all but a subtle taste that is in the background.    So far have only had hash bowl and veggie bowl.  Both very healthy and what I found to be delicious as well.  Now one has to remember that the veggie hash bowl is all about the veggies and kale, so you might want to ask for extra creamy avocado for a bit more wetness.  Haven't tried all their other items yet, but can't imagine them not delivering the same good quality that my sampling has.  And finally......keep in mind this is all about freshness, no preservatives, and natural ingredients.  It won'be be like a Starbucks caramel fattachino or the store brought smoothies that are loaded with sugar.

I hate giving a 1 star rating, but here is the experience or lack of.  The food was "unique" to say the least.  The server said and I quote "it's a new chef and his dishes look really great".  To bad the new chef didn't put a lot of emphasis on the quality part.  The pasta primavera was, unfortunately to say, nothing short of inedible.  Pasta that was under cooked, a sauce that was non existent and literally no taste at all.  Basically horrible.  My significant other had the fish tacos.  Now I've had a few fish tacos in my life, and this was basically deep fried fish in a tortilla with tartar sauce.  No kidding!!!  We sent it back as it wasn't anything like the menu described.(way way to much breading and not a hint of spice or seasoning).  There was only one female server who seemed disinterested in the customers and more focused on talking with another server.  Tried to rationalize how the fish tacos where really good and "if I was sure I wanted to send them back?".       So quick recap- service not good, food horrible and I don't even want to go into the Jack and Coke that was again "unique" but not in a good way.

Okay guys why didn't you let me know you had the best gosh darn protein shakes in the valley?  Would have never thought to go here for a shake or smoothie.  Try one then you'll understand.    Also liked the friendly staff and made me wonder why I'm buying mass processed vitamins from Costco instead of spending maybe two or three dollars more to get something that is made better, works better and is better for you?

So I'm thinking to myself "another pizza joint".  And as I had mentioned before, Arizona isn't on my top list for good pizza.  Walked in and was instantly greeted by two things.  First a smiley bartender that was very welcoming and a beautifully decorated bar.  So far so good!  Tried their house wine which was really good and had two slices of their pizza (available either whole pie or by the slice).  First was the plain cheese pizza.  One thing I'm very particular about is the sauce.  It was to have a rich tomato taste that doesn't taste out of a can, with a bit of seasoning.  By far one of the best sauces I've tasted in the valley.  Cheese was quality and thin crust perfectly cooked.  Next was their meat/pepper slice.  Whoa did that pack a bit of heat.  Not to the point of overwhelming the pizza but had a nice kick to it.  Italian sausage was good as well (not sure if it was homemade and forgot to ask).  So of course I had to have the gelato dessert after it was described to me as "heavenly".  Tried the sea salt caramel that turned out to be unbelievable- I mean delicious, creamy and tasty unbelievable.  Had some other unique flavors that are next on my list to try.  Great food, service and pizza for sure!!!!

Grabbed a seat at the bar and decided to check out the happy hour menu.  Bartender knew exactly how to help me when I was deciding on the salmon.  Ordered the house salmon which comes with baguettes and creme fresh.  Excellent piece of salmon and the baguette was toasted just right.  Great dish overall.  The fiancée ordered the shredded beef tacos and no complaints for the $5.00 price.  It didn't wow me, but for $5.00 to enjoy some tender beef with a good sauce, you can't complain at all.  Lastly they we're talking my language.  A burger, fries and beer combo.  Burger is fresh ground in house and you can tell.  Ordered medium rare, and came out perfect temperature.  Toasted ciabatta bun and black pepper aioli.  Fries were  good but the hand crafted beer selection is even better :)   So to top it all off, the famous and home made banana cream pie.  Won't say much except you have to order it.....okay I will say it was damn good!!!  Actually all their desserts are made in house, so I have a feeling no matter what you order you won't be disappointed   Service, quality and value 100%. Absolutely will be back

Have been here several time and on my last visit it was as good and consistent as my first time.  First, kudos for having fresh squeezed orange juice, not to many places take the time and this one does.  So Fiancee had the crepes and I had the crab and cheddar omelette.  We did share as the crepes where huge!   The crepes had ham, mushrooms, spinach and cheese.  Very impressed, the crepe was perfectly done and beautifully presented.  There was the right amount of balance between the eggs, spinach, mushrooms and cheese.   Did I mention the portions size was huge??  Not kidding as we took a whole one home and I have a good sized appetite.   The omelette contained crab, cheddar cheese and had ritz crackers on top.  Couldn't understand the ritz cracker thing until I started eating.  Fluffy eggs cooked perfect with a rich cheddar throughout with a good size helping of crab.  Now this is where the Ritz crackers come in- as rich as the components are, the crackers provided just the right balance and saltiness to the dish.  Who would have thought.  At this point, anything you could have done to the hash browns or pancakes that came with the omelette wouldn't have mattered, but hash browns cooked perfectly and the pancakes I was again impressed.  Light, almost buttermilk but something different and by different I meant delicious.    Service prompt and polite.  Remember to come early or late on weekends as there sometimes is  a small wait  Overall, a great breakfast with a great atmosphere.  Probably my favorite place in AZ so far.

Have been to this place twice, and each time had a great experience.  Both times I had ordered off the specials while my fiance took the more traditional breakfast route.    Today I had the Beef Brisket and Eggs skillet.  Basically a large helping of tender beef brisket, a few scrambled eggs with fresh veggies mixed in.  Perfect combination Desert Ray's!  Had the country potatoes and pancakes for the sides.  Country potatoes where good, and pancakes quite delicious.  Fiancee had the vegetarian Benedict, and judging by how fast she ate, it was very enjoyable.  The poached eggs looked perfectly cooked and glad her English muffin was properly toasted vs being just warm like a few places had served them.  Vegetables where fresh and another good point is the tomatoes where really red, which meant perfectly ripe.    Now when the food is this good, I can overlook some of the slight service issues.  Please Desert Ray's, train your waitresses to check on their tables.  Had to get up and get my own ketchup.  She was younger, so obviously hadn't been doing this that long, but place wasn't that busy.  Stopped by at the end of breakfast but was personable and friendly.    One last small detail- and just because my fiancee was a bit thrown off.  The servers all looked professional in their black polo shirts.  After all, you are charging $12-13 for breakfast, so a clean place (definitely spotless) and a professional staff is important.  So what threw me off was the gentleman who was the host in a green t shirt and orange cargo pants.  When I first saw him, I thought he just came from the gym next door.  Turns out he was the host or manager. (and was very helpful to all guests and friendly- cool guy)....Just saying when your in North Scottsdale, and your place is very tidy and professional, wouldn't it make sense to reflect that?    Will absolutely come back and if your looking for a good breakfast spot, give them a try.

Okay, I thought this was going to be a 4 to 5 star experience after looking at the menu.  So it's Sunday nite and I ordered online to pick up a to go order.    So..here is where the fun begins.  I waited 25 minutes after I ordered before I left, which was about a 10 minute drive.  35 minutes to prepare exactly---1 miso soup, 1 cucumber salad and 1 Ahi specialty roll.  That's it.  Arrived and was told "they are getting it ready now".  Sunday nite, only 4 tables in the entire restaurant, hostess was rolling silverware.  Not much going on it seemed.  10 minutes waiting at the bar, I ask "ah where is my order".  The response from the bartender was "oh we were really backed up, but it's coming right up".  Another 3 minutes later finally it came and the bartender was nice enough to say he included an complimentary edamame.  Normally a great thing but no one asked if I needed a water, or how about just letting me know someone screwed up and it took 15 minutes to make one roll.  Soup and cucumber salad was already made ahead of time.  No empathy and the apology was lack luster, like it had to be said.   So here you go, your apology!  Now let's get to the food-  The Miso Soup was good, but no chunks of tofu that I always love.  The cucumber salad had no seaweed or anything else but cucumber.  The cucumbers seemed like they were just cut and thrown into the vinegar compared to marinating to get the flavor. (as a side note, what is the shame in saying you ran out of something and don't want to half throw something together.  I would have totally understood).  The Ahi roll was good, almost bordering on really good but not quite.  The real kicker was that edamame that was complimentary- guess what?  No salt what so ever!!!  I hate to say this since I live in North Scottsdale, but what is the lack of customer service or caring that seems persistent in this city?  Nori has so much potential but the bartender who probably doesn't see what he does as a representation of himself, could care less.  The rest of the staff didn't have that much concern either that a customer's order wasn't even ready 35 minutes later but instead opted for a lame excuse instead of just saying "hey we made a mistake".  Lots of 5 star reviews for actually what is a bit above average sushi!

Just had a great dinner with the fiancé and I.  This place is a micro brewery so instead of writing about the beer, you have to just go ahead and try it.  The thing about beer is you can't say it's good or bad, it's up to the individuals taste.  So in other words, order a cold one!!  Had a burger and the only thing I wish is that is was grilled over flames compared to flat oven.  Not complaining but the bun does get soggy from the juices in the meat since you don't have that sear.  Mandy had the fish and chips and kudos for having Walleye as the fish.  Not to heavy breaking and quite delicious fries.  So instead of going with Bud, make the trip to try their brew.

What the world needs is not more sushi places but quality sushi places.  Squid Ink is 100% the quality place that should be the norm.  Started off with the usual Miso soup- a nice surprise was the mushrooms added.  Good flavor and added a twist.  Tried the Raman Noodles and while not a big soup fan, what went in the broth was excellent and very tasty.  No question it's a meal and not a soup.  Added the egg for the heck of it.  After the soup came a few rolls- most memorable was the surf and turf was cooked excellent as the meat part was tender.    Sushi was fresh and well prepared.  Overall a good experience and will be back

There's many Brazilian steakhouses in the valley, some chains that give a "corporate" experience and there are some that try to give an authentic dining experience.  Started off with a Caipirinha (traditional Brazilian cocktail) that made made perfectly- the right mixture of lime, sugar and cachaca.    Had two appetizers, the cheese bread which to me was slightly under cooked but very good and fried casava which was excellent.  Since we weren't to hungry we ordered the Feijoada, which again is a traditional Brazilian dish with rice, black beans that have sausage and smoked meat with a small side of greens and a vinaigrette that perfectly balances out the dish. I was absolutely amazed at the taste and the layers of flavor.  The staff was incredible, the food definitely homemade and everyone there seemed really to care about the guests and food.  This so far is on my top ten list of the valley

Not a bad little place.  The reason I say this it's like a Chipolte type dining- review the menu, and order at the register, grab a seat and food will be right on out.  Just stopped in for a light snack and had their Hummus Trio which was excellent.  Warm pita, sliced cucumber....and of course the three flavors of Hummus.  Original- yummy, creamy and smooth, not chunky like other places.  Went great with the cucumber.  Basil Pesto-  Talk about a nice twist.  Not overpowering but again very good.  Red Pepper- You actually had a bit of red pepper taste.  Perfect with the pita bread.  Service was friendly, place nicely decorated and very clean.  From what I saw the other dishes looked fantastic.  Now I'm not a big eat healthy kind of guy, but this place has my vote for freshness and flavor!

Wow, you know what makes working out fun?  When  you have a group of high energy people, good rock and roll and a great workout plan.  I never thought boxing classes would be me, but then again the staff at this place could make washing your car fun and energetic.  They seem to know when to push you a little bit more then when you  need some time to catch your second wind they sense it.  If you get bored with boxing or kick boxing, you can always hit the weights which is never crowded.  A plus for me since I'm a pretty impatient guy sometimes.  Want to say great job to everyone there for getting my booty in their!!!

If your not familiar with Canes the concept is simple- some great chicken fingers.  What makes it so great?  Aside from the delicious taste which is crunch and not greasy, Canes has their "Canes Sauce" which is the perfect dipping choice.  If you want some sides there is the Texas toast, coleslaw and fries   It's fast food that is delicious at an affordable price.
