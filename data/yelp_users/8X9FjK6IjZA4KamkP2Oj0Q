SERVICE - doesn't exist. Maybe try one of the other 3 or 4 locations on the strip?  They are standing around talking in groups instead of greeting customers. I stood and stared until I could get some help. And then still didn't walk me to the product, help me at all, but only pointed.   WTF?

Maybe they lost the hustle over there years? Not sure. I actually have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant for a few years, and have been waiting to get to Vegas. This was our least favorite meal over the three days we were in Vegas.  Atmosphere - slightly dated, loud  Service - mediocre, disorganized  Food - mediocre as well.  Bread Basket with Olives + Tapenade - ***** (amazing) Tomato Salad - ** (not fresh, bland) Squid + Octopus - *! (terrible, inedible, and server didn't ask why we didn't eat it, and she recommended it. Chewy. No flavor) Pork Chop w/gnocchi -- ** (barely okay, pork chop bland and poorly cooked, gnocchi's texture unappetizing and flavor was bland)  We skipped dessert since the only thing we ate that was good was the complimentary bread basket.

LOVED.   My parents are in Vegas a few times a year on business, and they always eat here their first night. I'm so glad we didn't skip their tradition when I joined them on their last trip.  Ambiance - a little modern, cool colors, white table cloths  Service - on top of it, friendly  Drinks - amazing  Food  - even better  Crab Cake Appetizer: 5 stars (and I don't like crab cakes usually) Tomato Salad - 4 stars Caesar Salad - 5 stars Mango Ceviche - 5 stars Salmon Entree - 5 stars Butterfish Entree - 5 stars (AMAZING. Melt in your mouth goodness) Jumbo Asparagus - 4 stars (light)

WHAT? Why would someone give this place a score lower than 5 stars? I've been to quite a few spas...resort, high-end hotels, nice boutiques. However, this place far exceeds expectations. Well, for the price of the services, it at least meets my expectation.  Personnel - super friendly, not in your way, and there to help   Therapist - my esthetician was excellent. I'm very scared about getting facials as I have sensitive skin. And she made the experience comfortable, she was a delight, and my skin is fresher than ever.  Facilities - clean, luxurious, and definitely unique. The best sauna and steam rooms that I've ever been in. The variety of rain type showers, including cold "igloo" type shower for detox...amazing. The aromatherapy options as well. Awesome. Showers are clean and large. The locker room is expansive, and has this easy to use security system for the lockers. I want this at my spa I use in SF! Personnel are easy to find if you need help. And towels are placed everywhere. Water and tea is also easy to find. The lounge is gigantic! You aren't on top of other ladies (that's rare), nice couches, lounge seats. I could have rested here or in the spa area all day.

I'm definitely staying again at this place. It's worth spending the extra little bit to stay at a clean, newer hotel with great service. The rooms are large with sunken living rooms and beautiful views.

Beautiful store, and excellent service in men's shoes. I didn't get to shop the whole store, but was delighted in our experience in the shoe department.

Stopped in here after a night out for a little treat plus a cappuccino. We sat at the bar, ordered the chocolate and peanut butter torte. WHOA. I'm not too into sweets nor rich stuff, but this thing's texture and flavor was amazing. I mean, you have to get this dessert!  Not to mention that the service at the bar was top-notch. My cappuccino took a bit of time, but I'm glad it did. A lot of restaurants use the pods or some quick way to make a coffee drink. But...this one...oh no...this one was made with special care. One of my top cappuccinos ever.   Best way to top off the night.

Was in Vegas for 3 nights, and this was my favorite meal by far. Also, the first place that actually served Mezcal. Thank you, finally.  Decor - comfortable and classy for a large Vegas restaurant. Tables are well-spaced from each other.  Service - 10 stars! Our server had the best attitude, great personality, and was on top of her stuff. She explained menu items, made suggestions, and just really had the best spirit.   Food - another 10 stars!   heirloom tomato salad - ***** (melt in your mouth) ceasar salad - ***** escargots - **** (different than expected, but still great) charcuterie board - ***** halibut - ***** (whoa, amazing) duck confit - ***** (dad loved, but note smaller sized entree) salmon entree - ***** (mom was super happy)
