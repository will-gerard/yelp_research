This tattoo shop does something which is extremely rare, that is it lives up to the hype.  After searching dozens of shops work online, I found Mark's.  When I visited him to discuss the full sleeve I wanted to do he was very receptive to my ideas and drew me a custom piece.  He very patiently went though several rounds of revisions with me  and now that I've finished my second sitting I couldn't be happier.  Also, the environment is everything you could ask for from a tattoo shop.  Well decorated and clean as an operating room, you can tell Mark and his Co-workers take pride in their work.  I'm traveling 50 miles each way to get work done here and would recomend you do the same!

This hotel was cheap and conveniently located on the strip; the staff were all pleasant and helpful as well, but that's about all I can say about it that's positive.  The entire casino is in need of an update.  The carpet throughout was old, and the theatre we saw the magic show in was very dated.  There was a hole in the wall of the room we got and the sliding closet door was off the hinges.  The shower nozzle was also clogged and had poor water pressure.  The room had the worst view and curtains wouldn't even close all the way so we could sleep in.  Parking in the garage was usually difficult.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're really on a budget.

Maybe my expectations were high due to all the great yelp reviews, but I found my experience disappointing. The restaurant was very crowded and noisy which isn't conductive to a pleasant experience. Our waitress delivered our food quickly, but my muffin was mostly cold and the food was rather plain. We also agreed the potatoes were way too salty. Overall I wish I had just stayed on the strip.

Nice atmosphere and a cozy little dining room, the food was exactly what we were looking for to satisfy our craving for Caribbean. I thought it was a little on the pricey side, but overall it was a great experience.

I have been using Jeremy's sharpening services to sharpen my dog grooming blades and scissors or a couple years now and I'm very happy I found him.  He is one of the most knowledgeable people I have encountered in his industry and always does a superb job. He comes highly recommended!

The friendly bartenders here not only remember my name and favorite drink, but always help me find a seat on crowded UFC fight nights.  Thanks Dakota and Brett for always doing a great job!

AZ Differential Specialists gave me the best estimate that I could find for rebuilding my transfer case so after reading these reviews I decided to use them.  Being on Grand avenue, I was already prepared for an older industrial looking building.  Its true they had very little parking and the shop definitely wasn't fancy, but those things really aren't important to me.  Bubba, their customer service rep, was very communicative and professional through the entire process and took the time to explain the work they were doing.  They were on time with the repair, and even offered a 12 month warranty on all repairs.  Overall this was a great experience and I'd gladly refer my family and friends for any work they needed to have done.

There seems to be a long wait and the prices are on the high side, but they had the best burgers I've ever had. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were also amazing as well as an attentive staff made this one of the best times I've had in Vegas.

Quite simply the worst chimi I have ever had, the only reason I am leaving two stars is I tried their signature dish and it wasn't bad, but honestly you have to try hard to mess up a pulled pork sandwich.

I brought my truck to service king for a minor accident I had. When I entered I noticed it was clean and professional looking and I was immediately greeted by a receptionist.  The repairs took a little longer than I expected for such a minor accident, but they let me know why every step of the way.   The work they did looks perfect and the minor issue I had was handled immediately and professionally. I got my truck back sparkling clean and looking brand new!

When I took my date here on a Sunday night I was somewhat skeptical since Goodyear isn't exactly known for their breweries. Pleasantly surprised is an understatement. We both appreciated every aspect of this brewery. The decor was clean, modern and a touch on the industrial side, the staff very polite and helpful, and we both found a beer we loved.  The food was also better than expected.  I would highly recommend taking a tour of the actually brewery as well, the manager on duty was great about answering all of our questions about the brewing process.

Too bad zero stars isn't an option.  It really needs to be, but that would be too many even for this place.  I took my Dodge Ram Diesel in because it was acting sluggish and not shifting right and they told me it needed a new transmission for 4,000$!  I took it to AAMCO for a second opinion, and they discovered a blown hose clamp that cost about 5$ to fix.  Avondale Dodge TRIED TO STEAL $4,000 FROM ME!!!  Do not ever go here unless you enjoy being lied to, cheated, and stolen from!!!!  Also, please read their filtered reviews!  All are obviously real people that are also really upset.

Sadly enough I grew up playing video games in arcades, so what i assume is supposed to be a retro concept is all to familiar to me. None the less, I really enjoyed whats actually a really cool bar and a somewhat novel concept.  Also, the live dj was a really cool touch, however the music was really hit and miss and too loud to maintain much of a conversation.  I'd definitely recommend this bar for a fun night out, also dont forget to check in on yelp for free tokens and ladies play free Wednesday nights.
