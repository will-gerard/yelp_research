I recently visited As You Wish with my grandma and was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and endless options for designing your piece.    Our visit was on a Monday morning shortly after opening so I'm sure it was slower than the norm, but all of the employees working were more than willing to help out and answer any questions we had.   They have tons of options as far as pottery pieces, paint, stencils, & stamps.   I will definitely be back as it seems like it could be a great gift idea for loved ones and I can't wait to see how my piece turns out!

I foolishly went to Starbucks everyday for years, until a friend of mine introduced me to Dutch Bros Coffee.    Let's just say I haven't been back to Starbucks in over a year.  This place is great.  Great coffee, great service.  Keep it up guys!

stopped at churn while a family member was visiting and they were craving some ice cream...we couldn't have been more pleased with the taste of the ice cream, great local flavor!  Plenty of options and they offer samples of each. A must-try in my opinion!!

Since opening a few years back, Brat Haus has always been one of my favorite places in old town.  My boyfriend and I are regulars here and not only is there food great, but they also have an exceptional rotating beer list.   I also love that they have happy hour everyday, even on weekends and their outdoor area is amazing & includes ping pong, giant jengas, and bean bags.

I've been to Fate more than a handful of times and have always had a great experience.  Even though their newer, larger location is closer to where I currently live, I always take the longer trip to this one.    Employees are friendly and the service is excellent.  I love the Pablo Honey pizza.  Beers are always refreshing and they typically have something new to offer each time I drop by.    Also, the habanero oil that they have for your pizza is amazing.  I love the added kick it gives my pizza as my boyfriend who usually tags along is not a fan of spicy.

I went here a few weeks ago with a friend to grab a couple of drinks, it was the first time for both of us.    We stopped in on a Thursday night, & I liked that they had live music, but I didn't feel as though they had the best set up for the performer.    I also liked the fact that they have daily specials, big plus for me when going out to local bars/restaurants.    What I didn't care for was the food.  While they have a fairly limited menu to begin with, it was even more limited due to the fact their fryers were 'broken'.  Nearly half of the menu items we weren't able to order so I just ordered the O.G. Grilled cheese sandwich with the house seasoned chips (since fries were not available).  The grilled cheese lacked any gourmet aspect and the house seasoned chips were simply cheap store bought chips and sprinkled with pepper.  Both of which I can probably accomplish in my own kitchen for less than $9.00.  With that said, neither of us will probably head back to this establishment.

My boyfriend and I finally went here a few nights ago to use a groupon that we had purchased a while back.    Upon entering, we noticed it was very quiet for it being dinner hour and there was no host/hostess to be found or even a sign stating to seat yourself.  After awkwardly standing there for a hot minute, a gentleman finally came to greet and seat us.  While being seated he stated they had a 'rush' today, everyone was trying to use their groupon before it expired so they were out of all chicken and brisket items on the menu.  This was a huge disappointment.    We were left with pulled pork, ribs, or salad.  My boyfriend got the ribs and I decided to go with the pulled pork.  Both were a little dry and under seasoned; however, their BBQ sauce was decent.    Overall their food was nothing id go running back for, but I did appreciate the nice craft beer list they had.
