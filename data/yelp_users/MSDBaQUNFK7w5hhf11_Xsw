I know fellow Yelper Sarah L. will try to outdo me on this review, but I say bring it on.  We arrived to the restaurant @  6:30 which was our reservation time. We had a large group (12) and the table had already been pre-set. I enjoyed that more than seeing servers scurrying around getting tables together, or worse yet, not having the foresight to ensure that there were enough tables for our group. One thing that I did not enjoy about our arrival was the aroma of slightly fermented fish. Although I despise any fish or shellfish in Arizona (save sushi) I thought this place might have higher standards on freshness. Maybe I was smelling their garbage. In any case, my nose did not  get a good first impression.  We sat down and ordered beverages. I started with a mojito and water. The mojito arrived quickly but the water did not. After 5 minutes, I asked our server if I could have water. He did not seem upset or irritable about my request. He got it quickly and for the rest of the evening, my water was constantly refilled.   The service was unremarkable. Which is good. If I remember something about the service, it is because they hover, or forget or get too personal. The staff was friendly, helpful and quite professional.   We had thought about getting tapas but people started ordering tapas as entrees and I wanted to enjoy my entree fully. On the next visit I will grab some. For my meal, I ordered the paradise pulled pork which is Tender, lean pulled pork sautéed with onions, sweet peppers, garlic and herbs, laced with habanero chiles. Served with black beans and rice. The server remarked good choice. I asked him if he was lying. He said no and I believed him.   As people started receiving their entrees, I could tell that they liked them. I did not observe one person from our group add any salt or pepper to their dish. That says a lot about the preparation of the dish. Most of us are picky eaters. As for mine, it was very savory, with an excellent initial taste that leaves a garnish of habanero heat on the palette. I would compare the taste of it to many beautiful entree aromas I have smelled in the past, only to be disappointed by the actual taste. At Havana, they were not lacking in the taste department. Just to clarify, it hit my olfactory area and matched up with my tongue readily. The beans were divine, the rice was standard and unremarkable (use previous definition).   The night starts to wear down. One of the lights outside on the patio is a bit bright. I order coffee. The mug has an antiquity look about it. Not what I expected at a restaurant. The coffee was memorable. It had a good initial taste, not too hot, but felt like water as it washed down my throat. I am less apt to order it again.  Dessert came. My mother order the Marquesa de Chocolate a rich and creamy double chocolate paté laced with Grand Marnier and served with whipped cream and toasted walnut (their words). My friend Nicole tasted it and said it was moussy fudge. Although I did not have any, they were quite keen on it.   Fellow yelper Sarah L. glared at me all evening. And with good reason. My review will be better than hers.   Overall, the negs were fishy smell and remarkable coffee. Pozs are great food, unremarkable service and decent ambiance.

So I have worked in the catering industry for 6 years. Which means I work many weddings. Which are droll and predictable at best. As are the cakes. I despise Tammy Coe for her fondant cakes that are blissfully boring yet so cute (why can't I use italics for cute). Many others have little flavor or are repeating an idea that was authored by betty crocker generations ago.  This is where Honey Moon is different. Fresh fruit on top. Shaved icing on top in a simple and unpretentious manner. Moist but not disintegrating as you cut into it. Light yet flavorful. Good website. Free coffee. By far this is the only cake that I will steal from a wedding party for a taste. Everything else is fodder.

So I have been going to Chen & Wok for years. Getting the same thing. Sauteed spicy beef and teryaki chicken. Prices have only slightly risen over the decade to this market I have paid tribute too.  Honestly, get take out. The restaurant is not great for privacy, nor has it been upgraded in any major way. But it does not matter. Get the take out. Enjoy it at home.  Also, avoid other chen and woks around the valley. It is not the same.  My only recent concern is the transition from large styrofoam bowls for lunch to segregated trays that keep the meat from the rice. I like the rice immersed in my spicy sauce. Combining them is a hassle and messy. The dinner is better, with the rice and meat in its own respective carton.   I should try new things here but I have rarely been disappointed with my order.

So i have been here several times, and the owner dave, is nothing short of accommodating. My first visit i arrived 10 minutes before close and i felt bad for ordering food so close to their closing time. Although Dave was a bit put off by my truancy he made me an excellent pizza that i crave to this day.  Whether you get a sandwhich, pizza or whatever, the flavors are top notch. I think i appreciate their earnestness here. They are human. They do not smile through cheesy (pardon the pun) grins. They make food. Great food. A bit high on the fat side, but good pizza usually is. I doubt i will ever go anywhere else for pizza unless i am on a date. But i definitely will take dates here.

JKL chapter 1 Apparently Eddie, formerly of Eddie Matneys, owns this new restaurant in old town Scottsdale. I went there with two of my friends who love eating out and getting their drink on. It was a Tuesday night about 8 pm. When we arrived there were maybe 2 other groups there. We were shocked. Despite the economy, Eddie has quite a stellar reputation in the valley. But we stayed all the same.   We sat at the bar and ordered drinks as we studied the menu. The bartender was friendly and knew his way around the menu. We started out with MoRockin' Shrimp with chili-beer dipping sauce and dough balls as well as the Golden Spaghettini Egg Rolls and cashew sauce as well as the Grilled Honey-Spiced Chicken Lollipops. At first I was quite unsure of the Spaghettini egg rolls with cashew sauce. The bartender offered some raspberry coulis to make the meal comparable to a peanut butter and jelly concoction (his words). Tasting pasta wrapped in an egg roll is disappointing and crunchy with no center to anticipate. The MoRockin Shrimp were pretty flavorful but my friends and I were confused by the dough balls. We were unsure if Eddie was trying to make a less expensive dish in light of the current recession. But the fact that we noticed it does not fare well. The chicken was by far the best with a good flavor and presented elegantly.  I went to use the restroom and heard a voice in the stall. I was not sure if the person was talking to me, himself or someone else. No one else was in the restroom. I went outside for a smoke with my friends and Eddie the chef and proprietor approached us and thanked us for our business. He told me he recognized me from my shoes in the stall and that he uses the restroom as his office. It was a bit uncomfortable to have this encounter but we were confident that Eddie was in the kitchen that night.   We went back inside and ordered our entrees. Normally I do not order fish in AZ because it makes as much sense as mexican food in Montreal, as I do not find it commonly fresh. I got the East-Meets-West Sesame Tuna & Parmesan Halibut with bok choy and asparagus risotto. My friends got the Seared Diver Scallops, apricot & goat cheese risotto "baklava" and lamb chops. The bartender warned my friend that her plate would be hot but her baklava was luke warm. My fish came smelling like fish and the bok choy was so immersed in soy that there was no little room for any other flavor.   Finally we ordered the tiramisu cheesecake. One word. Costco. It felt like something I could have purchased at Costco in bulk. Not that I mind Costco but this is Eddie's reputation I am consuming. Although the service was great the food was not, especially since Eddie was there and we were the only group there when we left. I would like to chalk it up to the curse that had befallen Cook and Jacks but I do not know...

So I walked in here after having some cheap greasy pizza at mamma mias next door. I thought they were sno-cones. Well not really. They are shaved ice with high fructose syrup on top.   Not really sure what the difference is. I had a sample of the hot flavor. I figured hot and ice, how could you go wrong? It was an unfortunate substitute for cinnamon and was not very spicy. But it was a sample.   I purchased an iced chiquory coffee. It was pretty tasty. However, I am used to my iced coffee beverages to be more like Starbucks aka bitter, smoky and delicious. But I like supporting small business. It had half and half and some syrup (likely vanilla) in the middle and going through coffee then latte back to latte was a nice treat and lovely departure from the same. Although the drink was 3.50 it had its merits.  The proprietor, whose name escapes me currently, was very helpful and nice. I would go back just to talk to him.

Reservation Made one on Open Table but alas they did not get it. They put us down for the time we originally had 9:30 but did not get seated till 10:15. Had an awkward moment as we almost sat down in someone's table. However it was First Friday so cest la vie.   Ambiance.  Great. Downtown is a great spot to have a restaurant. It started to sprinkle on our outside table. Asked if we could have a large umbrella that looked available to cover us. Their response 'not really'.   Service. Not awesome. Not poor. Not especially helpful with menu items. Not especially intrusive either. Took several attempts to get basic condiments after tasting the food.   Delivery  We got our food about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. Despite their busyness that is great.  Presentation. Elegant on rectangular white ceramic dishes. The chopsticks they provide are smooth so not easy to use to grab food with.  Food. So sad. Ordered crispy duck & foie dumplings. Tasty but deep fried and it felt like we were biting into oil.  Seven spice duck confit. No flavor. Duck was not tender and greasier than I remember. Sauce was reminiscent of watered down beef condensed sauce. Tomato katsu. Fried green tomatoes Nuff said Vindaloo chicken. Chicken still had fatty skin on. Minted yogurt tasted like reduced coconut milk.  Shoyu ramen. Ramen with green onions, basil and mint with chicken. I could do that with costco ramen.   Overall Matt Carter has not impressed me. Too say the least, I miss Fate, the restaurant previously at this location. And he was there tonight. If this is as good as it gets, try a hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurant. Even the glib China Chile is better. Save your money.

La Playa is a quaint dive bar that recently got a makeover. Its glass walls were painted black which made for interesting summer visits. But now it attempts to have a beach motif, complete with a faux great white shark head biting an Arizona license plate and puffer fish.   It offers two pool tables, an electronic dart board and a pinball machine or two. Nothing remarkable there. It is well lit which coincides with its new attitude. There is also a digital jukebox and few pay-to-play digital game consoles at the end of the bar.   I have yet to eat the food. Honestly I will not likely try it.   There are a few pool/lawn plastic seats to sit on outside. They have some small plastic bins for garbage and cigarette refuse.  But the drinks are great and the prices cannot be beat. There is a very gorgeous bartender there sometimes. She is actually worth the trip. She makes a great root beer shot. None of the other customers seemed dismayed that there is no (none that I saw anyway) wine. Overall a pleasant drinking experience.
