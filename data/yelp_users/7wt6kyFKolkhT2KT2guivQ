We've been here many times and it's never been great but last night was by far the worst. We were seated promptly and our waitress came to take our drink orders right away.  That's where it gets iffy.. My daughter asked if the iced coffee was bottomless.. The waitress said "no". Then we looked at the menu and saw that yes it was bottomless and we told the waitress so. She was not happy. She brought our drinks and took our food order. At this time we noticed an older couple being seated.. We waited for our food.. And waited.. And waited.. We ordered breakfast for gawds sake. We watched the older couple get their food and eat and we were still waiting..  Almost an hour later, they were getting up and we were just receiving our food. The food.. It was cold when we got it, obviously it'd been sitting waiting for our waitress to pick it up for awhile. After finishing our breakfast, I excused myself to the restroom. On my way almost bumping into our waitress, she gave me such a look. Until this point she had not bothered to check on us, no refills on drinks, no ketchup that we'd asked for, we even had to snag silverware and salt from another table. She finally came over while I was gone to ask if we needed anything.. My daughter got us refills on our drinks. The waitress didn't even bother to bring me the check! Suffice it to say I did not leave a tip.. Which I never do as I've worked in the food industry and understand how much tips count towards a wait person's income. But the lack of service was so extreme..  It wasn't even busy, 4 table's occupied in the whole restaurant when we arrived. Management needs to either train their staff better or be replaced themselves. Ridiculous!

I stop by this Wendy's on the way to work quite often and for awhile now wanted to tell the cashier "D" what a refreshing and personable cashier she is. Always friendly ,always on top of an order, no matter how complicated it happens to be. I do not believe she can possibly be paid what she is worth, but I'd clone her if she worked for me and replace anyone who wasn't up to snuff. Keep up the good work "D", I always have a better day after the way you treat me and every other customer who comes through the que.

Once again I have to give mass props to an employee here named "D".  I used the drive thru today, and as always a friendly voice took my "special"order. And got it right.. a major plus..  But I was running late for work and didn't have the time to stop and get coffee creamer. I asked "D" if they had any. She and another lady came to my rescue and got me some in a little to go cup since they don't carry the little creamers.  They could have just said "no" and I'd have been disappointed but accepting. But no, they went out of their way to make me happy.  This crew is the best there is.. always friendly and on the ball.. I Sincerely hope the management here knows how lucky they are to have such great employees working for them.  Btw I come to this location at least three times a week. Keep up the great work!!!!

I come here quite often and invariably they mess up my order.  Today's screw up was I ordered 2 sandwiches without cheese and 3 sandwiches no lettuce.  What I got was 5 sandwiches no cheese and all of them had lettuce.  This is getting ridiculous. . The receipt was correct. . Exactly as I ordered it.. so that means the person who made the food cannot read at all. From now on no matter how many people are waiting behind me, I will check my order and make them fix it before they can help the next person. .

Apparently the people who work in this particular Wendy's are all morons.  For the second time in a row my order is messed up. I ordered a total of three burgers.. did I get them? No.. I got a single baconator.. instead of the double patty that it comes with. Mind you they also charged me extra for the cheese and the bacon.. over the price of the burger.. Then of the two other burgers, I received only one of them, but I sure paid for both, including be charged extra for the cheese that already comes on them. This is ridiculous.. tomorrow I will head in and speak with the manager.. but since I've just gotten off a 16 freakin hour shift I'm just to tired and frustrated to go and not say something I shouldn't about the lack of iq points the employees seem to share..

Dennys is your basic diner. It's great for what it is.  I often order take away when I've had to work late. Not to many choices after 10pm.  Friendly service and you almost always run into someone you know. This dennys is virtually a landmark even with the remodeling.  Jenny's/ gay dennys/ or just plain 7th st dennys. However you know this place, expect a decent meal for a decent price.

Times square cheese steak is my fave at this deli.. Perfectly cooked brisket, grilled onions and peppers, pepper jack cheese served with fries and a pickle for $11.99 Make sure you have time for a wait as this place is always packed during lunch time..

I've been bringing my truck here for more than a year for my oil changes. I've always paid for the full service oil change just to make sure all my fluids are topped up. Well I took my truck here for its latest oil change and left it to run accross to the shipping center accross Thomas. I guess I should have stayed.. Like I usually do.. Here it is not quite two weeks later and my truck started making unusual noises.. Come to find out my oil filter has not been changed, I'm down more than 2 quarts of oil, my radiator is empty and my transmission fluid is gunky.  Suffice it to say I will not be coming back and I will be looking into filing a complaint with the BBB.  So my advice is that if you want to bring your vehicle here, make sure you stay and watch what they do to your automobile.  As for me, I'm looking at having to have my engine completely cleaned of burnt oil and transmission fluid and hope I won't have to get a new transmission or engine.

My daughter and I came here after a particularly hard and long day. It was almost 1am and we were beat. The staff were friendly and extremely courteous. Our waitress bent over backwards, always checking on us. Brought us refills without needing to be asked and making sure our food was alright.  No this is not a Michelin star restaurant, it's an all night diner. The food is tasty and fast.

Wow!  Absolutely the worst taco bell food I've ever had.  The employees were nice.. but that's all I can really say that's positive about this location.  My order was taken correctly, but when I got home half of it was missing.  When my daughter and I actually bit into the tacos, it was like eating slimy dust.  I immediately spit it back out. She did the same..  Ultimately, it ended up in the rubish bin.  A complete waste of time and money. We won't be going back..

I was supposed to meet up with some friends here tonight.  I guess they chickened out and left me sitting for two hours before finally texting and letting me know plans had changed. I've been to clubs like this in L.A., NYC and London.  Never have I felt like a fresh piece of meat like I did tonight.   There were maybe five couples,  a pair of women together and about twenty guys. Unfortunately they were not the type of men I normally find myself conversing with.  Most clubs like this try to keep a balance of women and men. This place obviously does not. Warning to all single women,  unless you like out of shape, over the hill, non-english speaking men who obviously can't tell when a woman is not interested I'd avoid this place if either going alone or meeting people there.  It did however seem clean,  the staff polite and friendly,  and some larger sized security.   So.. owners of encounters, please please please,  regulate how many single guys you let in.. otherwise you will continue to see a lack of single women.  No one likes feeling hunted!

My empty plate should be proof enough of my enjoyment of this establishments food..   Always good food and friendly staff. We eat here about every other week and have never had an unpleasant experience.  I do agree with some comments on yelp when it comes to the soda bread. If they improved that they'd gain the 5th star.

This is the most "Ghetto" walmart. The lines are insane. Doesn't matter when you go there are never enough check out lines. I've actually left full carts full of food because I've gotten fed up with trying to check out. No one should have to pay for warm frozen food.. talk about a health hazard.  I've had both good and bad experiences with the employees here.   But worst of all is the people begging for money. Both outside the store in the parking lot as well as randomly walking up to you inside the store. Something really needs to be done about that ..

I luv dutch bros coffee..  Unlike it's closest competitor, the coffee here does not have that burned after taste. They have locations all over the valley and are almost always busy. Avoid during rush hour if your driving. The drive thru is usually wrapped around the building and into the street. Walk up customers have an easier go of it. The staff are EXTREMELY friendly! If morning perkyness annoys you either skip this place or just smile and nod till you've got your coffee and can mumble grumpy things as you pull away..  !!! THEY NOW HAVE K CUPS!!!

Ran in here today because I needed a restroom.  The barista on duty was friendly and efficient. The coffee was tasty and not overly pricey..  The restroom was clean and fully stocked.  I'd return definitely..

I've never really had a problem with this restaurant until today.   I often order take out from here.  Always the same thing.  Chicken coconut curry soup, rice and a Thai iced coffee.  My order is usually correct.  Today however,  what I ordered was not what I received.  What I received was tom yum soup. Which has tomatoes and no coconut milk.  I tried correcting the server.  He just kept saying he got it. Whatever.   I got to work with my lunch and wallah.. it's wrong. .just like I knew it would be.  So I'm stuck with food I don't particularly care for because a server thought he knew best. Yeah right.  So anyone know a good Thai place close to this one? Doesn't matter if they speak English or not since I speak Thai.

Friendly people run this place.   The food is good if a little americanized.. would have liked more flavour. . I had the chicken kabob sandwich and chicken potato curry soup..  It was all under $10.00 even with a soda.. I'll be back. .

I came to Ruby Tuesdays for lunch today.  Been out running errands,  not lookin my best and the hostess seated me in the far back corner away from other guests.   That's fine.. I don't really mind being hidden away like a dirty little secret. . Atleast it was quite.   My server was polite,  she took my drink order then brought me some biscuits with my Coke.  When she returned I ordered the Asiago peppercorn steak with grilled zucchini and mashed potatoes.  $14.99  Now just let me say I LUV A GOOD STEAK!  My steak was a perfectly prepared medium. Properly seasoned and delicious. My only complaint would be it wasn't large enough. . I could easily have devoured 18oz's of this steak.   The grilled zucchini was perfectly seasoned if a little undercooked.  The mashed potatoes however were rather unpalatable. I truly expected real potatoes not instant. If i'd known I would have ordered the baked potato. It's much harder to fake..  The server came and checked on me once but never offered to refill my coke.  When I was finished,  I headed for the hostess station to pay since the server hadn't brought me my check.  So.. order the steak,  only the steak, and nothing but the steak. .

My 5 star rating is for the drivers I've had.   User's app is easy to use and generally reliable, but there is really no customer contact with the company.  I've several friends who drive for Uber and lyft. Neither company seems to give a fig for their drivers. Their views being that there will always be more people to drive so who needs to pay a decent wage.  TIPS are not included in the fare.   Treat the drivers like your friends and their cars like your dad's. Don't spill food or drinks, don't attempt to smoke.   Don't expect drivers to provide waters, candy, gum or other"extras" if you're unwilling to TIP! As Uber does not provide these, don't expect the drivers to pay for it, especially on a $2.80 fare.  Cost breakdown: $2.80 fare  Gas- $0.35 Insurance - $0.97 Upkeep - $0.67 -------------------------------- Total: $1.99  So I guess the $0.81 is the TIP huh??  Not to mention time and frustration let alone vehicle value depreciation.  So remember the next time you climb into the back of some poor uber driver's 2016 car you don't put your dirty shoes on their seats, you don't spill your soda or drip big Mac sauce all over the back of the seat. Tip your driver for putting up with your drunk butt and getting you home safely and saving you the cost and embarrassment of a DUI.   Oh and FYI, uber charges passengers $200+ for vomit clean up! And that is one charge you can't dispute.

I might change my review IF I EVER GET TO EAT HERE!  I have tried 3 times this month to try and eat at this establishment.  The first time I pulled in and found a note on the door stating they were closed do to a family emergency.  Okay.. I understand that..  The second time they were open and had a pair of customers at a table inside.  I approached the counter to order a couple of pounds of brisket.  I was then informed that they were OUT OF BRISKET. Now this was lunch time. What restaurant runs out of brisket at lunch time with only a pair of customers?  So I left, deciding I'd give this place one last try.  Today,  yes, New year's eve day, I tried again.  And once again,  there was a note on the door stating that the restaurant was closed until Jan. 2nd for vacation.   Now I realize that everyone deserves a vacation. But it seems this place is either closed for some random reason or out of food..  I guess i'll stick with either Waldo's for ribs or Texas bbq house for brisket.   I don't know if i'll even bother trying to try this place again. .

Well.. the inside of this place is cute n quaint.. the food is alright.. but the prices are ridiculous.. Extremely over priced for the portion size. $14.00 for 3 slices of brisket, a piece of tx toast a cornbread muffin and a sm deli cup of cole slaw is nutz. If you've paid attention to my reviews you would know how much I LUV meat..  I expect a decent portion of it when I spend this on lunch. So in my humble opinion I'd tell any and all persons to head over to Tx bbq on roser and 24th st. Your still going to pay $14.00 fer lunch but at least you'll get a WHOLE POUND of yummy meat fer the same price.

My first time to this restaurant and it won't be my last.  As everyone who knows me will tell you, I love BBQ. A true carnivore!! I'm that freak who order's the 72oz steak and finishes it in half an hour..  But if it's not cooked properly, after only a few bites I'll leave..   So when I was driving home from dropping my daughter off to hang out with friends, I noticed a plain sign that said "BBQ". (I'd seen it before, but hadn't had the opportunity to try it)I decided, why not, I've not had lunch yet. I pulled in, the lot was pretty empty (not a real good sign). Parked and went on in. (Only one other customer)  The restaurant is pretty large and could handle large groups and looks more like a country sports bar than a restaurant.. I was greeted by a man and a woman behind the bar who were very friendly. The woman took my order( half pound of brisket, half pound of rib tips and a small order of fries to go) It came to just under $20.00. When my order was ready, the man opened each to-go box and showed me my food, then bagged it up fer me. Now, I must say I was impressed by the fact that everything was in its own container and the BBQ sauce was also packaged separately. Sauce can so easily ruin good meat.. I sped home to try my newest finds.. The brisket was quite good, moist and tender, but I've had better.. But this was in my top 5.. The fries were yer run of the mill crinkle cut frozen French fries, but they were perfect and crisp, not soggy at all.. Not even to much salt! But the rib tips.. OMG.. They were out of this world delish.. Moist, tender and juicy.. They needed no sauce.. Perfectly seasoned and cooked!! The absolute best I've ever had!!!!  This place is so unassuming, but you have got to try it.. A friend of mine is a local food critic and I will be recommending she try it soon.. A 4.8 **** star rating from me..
