I love this  mall!!! If you are in Scottsdale, Az  , you have to go there, and after you are done with your shopping, there s plenty of great..  I mean great restaurants to  walk to!   One of the best mall i have ever been if  not the best!! Some  stores are very high end  but you  also have something for everyone as there is plenty of stores to shop too.

I went there for lunch, since i have heard about this place a lot and always wanted to go everytime i go to Vegas, so this time i went... i was not too impres at all, went there for lunch, and for 25$ i was expecting a much better quality of food and , there was only 3 kinds of poor quality sushi. if you like to eat chicken and just plain food .. i guess it could be ok, but i will not return to eat there.. not really worth it.
