i love cosmoprof! Being a hairdresser its a place i have to go to often. I Almost dread going everytime because the staff is always horrible. I feel like they train their staff to be mean . Ive tried going to different locations but the staff is rude at each one. They are never helpful. I wish it was more of a pleasant experience because i love all the different brands they carry.

Don't Shop at this overpriced store with incompetent staff that do not offer any help whatsoever.  I'm a disabled 59 year old lady who went to the the other side of town to shop at Toys R Us for my grandchildren and not one clerk would assist me with pricing or lifting any heavy items that I could obviously not pick up or carry. When I asked to speak with the manager she was practically running away from me. I guess ill just continue getting my toys from walmart

Great spot to go to when you want to wash your own car! its really affordable and the staff is really friendly. I usually go on the weekends and a man named dannon always helps me with what ever i need. There's a lot of air fresheners , towels, cleaners etc..to choose from in the vending machine. its a great family owned business! Id definitely recommend it if your not too lazy. I always feel great knowing i washed my own car when i leave.
