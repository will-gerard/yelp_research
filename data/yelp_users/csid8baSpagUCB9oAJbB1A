I love this place! Great beer specials and cool drinks. I like how they have lighter bowling balls with bigger finger holes for the ladies. The service is great and people are friendly too. Perfect place for a bowling date or even just some good old fashioned family fun. Whatever the case may be I recommend this place to all my friends! $8 dollars shoe rental and all you can bowl during the week!

Loved the outdoor patio! Super cute intimate lighting and misters. Great wine selection also!   Perfect for a first date kinda night or a casual night out gossiping with the girls drinking wine. :)

I work a few offices down and always make it a point to grab a coffee from solo on my 10 minute breaks. The art and the atmosphere is beautifully decorated and the people are great.  There is a gentleman who does not even work there, but when it gets packed, never hesitates to jump in and help out.   There is a sense of community at Solo and everyone is welcomed! I love my daily med iced mochas. Perfect chocolate to milk to coffee ratio that gives me just that extra kick in the mornings to be on the phones all day after a night out with the girls.   Sometimes they will convince me to try something different and never disappoint me. Such as a pump of lavender in an iced American tottie. If you haven't tried it... It's UNREAL!   Thank you for keeping it real and hope that Solo never changes! Love you guys!

I do not recommend this place AT ALL!  It honestly tastes like an extremely over priced microwaveable dinner. I ordered a filet mignon medium rare. There was absolutely no taste to anything. Maybe the chef forgot all the spices. The vegetables tasted like they came from a can. My filet was also over cooked to a well done. There was no juicy pink center. Very unhappy.

Ordered the pad Thai noodles and was very happy! The atmosphere is cool too! Right when you walk in they have two fish tanks! Love how you can choose the level of Spicyness! The layout is a little weird but the food is great!

I am an extremely positive and outgoing person. I hate to be the one that complains...But if my review can help the next person, I should probably fully disclose the issues and reasons why this place is By far the worst apartment complex I have ever lived in.   Management is completely non existent. It is an older apartment complex so there's always something that needs to be fixed.  My air conditioning leaks water and constantly needs repairs. Due to not being fixed properly the first time, there is now mold growing around the air conditioning. Maintenance is always looking for the quick fix rather than the quality of their apartment complex.   Non-residents park in the assigned ports because they know they won't get towed. When I walked into the office to ask for the towing company number to remove the jerk parked in my assigned spot, Management had no idea. There is no towing company with Chazal. Management can never answer any of my questions or direct me to someone who can. Now I understand why there is a high turnover in employees at Chazal.   Do not bother calling or emailing. You will never receive an email or call back. You either have to take time off of work to go into the office, if they are even there, to speak to someone during the week. Or wait until the weekend to have an issue resolved.

Steven is an amazing maintenance guy. He is a leader who who listens and so is Angela. They both have been assisting me with this awful mold issue in my ceiling....   Although they have an A for effort...I still strongly recomend Do not live here unless you enjoy the presence of black mold.   Removing drywall and putting Kilz over moldy wood is not enough to remove the mold. It will spread and eventually make Chazal apartment complex too hazardous to have residents.   This place should be knocked down.

Loved this place! Grilled chicken panini is amazing! I also love the bruschetta choices! Can't wait to go back and try the hummus nachos! Their wine specials and happy hour are great for a relaxing date night or wine tasting with the girls. Definitely recommend this place and plan on becoming a regular!

My parents wedding cake was portillos chocolate cake!!! I'm from Chicago and nearly passed out with excitement when I found out a Portillos was being built in Arizona! When eating my Chicago dog, dipped Italian beef or drinking my chocolate cake shake, it's like I'm back in Chicago. I went 4 days in a row and sometimes go twice in one day! I cannot get enough!
