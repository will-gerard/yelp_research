Sadly, I am forced to agree with Leslie M who wrote on 4/10. This was one of my favorite places to visit, to introduce newcomers to, treat family and friends, and for a time I'd visit once every two months or so. My previous three visits have not gone so well; I'll relate my latest visit which took place just over a week ago. A friend attempted to make reservations for two on a Thursday. He was told that due to a policy change by  Richardson, a reservation for two on a Thursday could no longer be taken, as there was disappointment that their business for tables of 4 or more were suffering. Okay, I can understand, business decisions have to be made, but cut your nose off to spite your face? However, the woman that answered the phone let us know there should be no problem getting a table. I was seated shortly before my friend arrived so I had a chance to look over the menu. To my surprise, some changes have been made. First, a salad choice (and they're all very typically very yummy), anyway, a choice is no longer offered. Instead, the house salad is offered at $4 with the entree purchase. Next, a statement is now printed across the top of the menu letting the patron know "you order it, you bought it"...is this REALLY necessary? While the server and busboy were friendly and helpful (my water glass was never empty), my $4 house salad arrived about 90 seconds before our entrees did. Oh, the accompanying bread was hard as stone and arrived with my salad, while an attentive server should have brought it along just after our drinks were served, as my dinner partner hadn't ordered a salad. Oh, my friend, he's typically a big fan of the Steak Rokerij, and absolutely loves the crab/hollandaise sauce mixture. As normal, he asked for more sauce. On this visit, we found $10 added to the check for that request. We found that unusual for Rokerij. Things have certainly changed. I was willing to overlook these changes, after all, the economy is poor these days. I excused myself to use the men's room. After all, we did have Chimay (Rokerij has never had a wide beer selection). I found the towel basket to be so PACKED with paper-towels, I couldn't get one out of the basket, which is on a vanity so small, when you turn the water on, the towels become soaked. This explains the stained, linen towel basket liner...the stains were grays and greens. Overall, I feel that these things add up to failing to pay attention to detail. It's a shame really. I really hope the best for Richardson and hope Rokerij can return to it's former self.

I've visited Taylor's Cafe off and on over the last few years, it's been months since I've been in but finally decided to write a little something.  Taylor's is tucked away among a few other local businesses. You may need to look around to actually find it. Hint: park in the back parking lot/east parking lot, you'll have no problem spotting it from there.  Go for the fresh squeezed Orange Juice. They squeeze it per glass, and go for the Victor Ostrovsky Art, and also if you're a fan of supporting local businesses. Give up on IHOP and Denny's, forget the "fad" "big breakfast" places and give a neighborhood place a try.  I've generally visited early in the morning, before the "brunch crowd" and have had exceptional service and food.

Kidstop is an independently owned toy store, a rarity in this era of retail megaliths trying to run the locals out of business. The store was busy, but not chaotic; a rare find during the Christmas buying season. My sales person was friendly and didn't try to pressure or hassle me into buying anything specific. He DID however, know MUCH about the toys the store stocked, the target age-group, and how the toy's worked. With the ambient Christmas music (not too loud), the uncluttered aisles, and no-hassle environment, i didn't feel that I had to grab something and RUSH to get out as quickly as possible; a comforting alternative to the retailing giants.  My salesperson helped me find what I hope my 9 - 11 year old nieces and nephew will really enjoy.  Kidstop offers free gift wrap too! Merry Christmas!

Kim's service on the patio tonight helped to make it a perfect dining experience! Bacon wrapped filet was perfectly cooked, especially the smokey bacon. The delmonico and lobster tail were delicious, and that butter cake dessert.... Amazing!! No wonder they won an award for it!!

Yup...5 stars. It's not a fancy place..it's a hole in the wall, down-home type of breakfast and lunch place. First time there with my regular Sunday breakfast buddy, the coffee princess. We didn't dig the coffee, but everything else...WOW...Their walnut cinnamon roll won first prize at the state fair and was well deserving. Scrambled eggs with cheese and knock your socks off hot sauce?? yes..PLEASE! We'll be back.  Be sure to bring your glasses or contacts though. Much of the menu is written on sheets on the walls, nice touch, but if you've got a case of the morning groggy's, you might have trouble seeing them from afar.

I can't say enough about this business. They really know their stuff, professional and also social. As a homeowner, I occasionally have need for an electrician, a job too big for me to tackle on my own for instance. In the summer of 2008 I'd completed an exterior remodel and obtained a jacuzzi that required 220. I also wanted to equip the same patio with three ceiling fans and a couple extra outlets. After talking with them in person on the patio, checking out the job, I knew I'd be in good hands. Shortly after, I received a thank you email and thereafter, a very professional bid, and we scheduled the job shortly after. In no time at all, my jacuzzi was bubbling and heating, and my j-boxes were ready to receive ceiling fans. I could say so much more about this company, they're really well put together and I'd recommend them to any home-owner. Their reviews on the ROC websites enforce the fact that this is a company worthy of a bid.

Cornbread, crispy fried chicken and a waffle..mmmm..mmmm!! I've friends that rage about that other place in south phoenix, and would be glad to visit, but i came across this place while doing some shopping with a friend. It's located where one of my favorite greasy spoons used to be, but sadly they closed. The place was in desperate need of a makeover, and it got it! bright and clean when I was in a couple months ago, and the owners were cheerfully at work in the kitchen. They'd been open for awhile and are not new to the phoenix restaurant scene. If you're looking for Soul Food in the north-central valley, give this place a shot!
