Love this place!! Me and my fianc√©e went there yesterday.  The food was delicious. And we had the coolest server ever! Toma was on top of it. And had some great food recommendations.  I hadn't been here in a while and glad I came back!

This place is amazing! I always get the Bird omelet. It's a little pricey but the fact they are always consistent with quality and taste. It's worth it.  It's very popular so plan on a bit of a wait on the weekends.  But now that it's cooking off the patio is great to sit at

This place is an absolute joke! I was in a motorcycle accident and came in to have my hip scanned to make sure it was ok. I was in there for maybe 1.5 hours, The nurse came in once, and the doctor stopped in once. He never came back with the pain meds he promised. Since my insurance company decided to not pay the claim, i was stuck with $2600 bill for my little visit. That is absolutely outrageous they can charge that much. and when i try to negotiate due to having to come out of pocket on it. They will not adjust... For that price, i could have stayed in a hotel on Park Ave in Manhattan and got better service. I will say one thing.. The nurse that came in at first was very nice, but the price they want for this and stick you with is insane.. And if you tell them to "F" off, they ruin your credit with their bill.. Real Cute.

Great store and customer service! They are very knowledgeable and can always help you find a product that will help you with the results your looking for. And prices are very competitive.  I highly recommend checking this place out.

Beware of hair!! I ordered the surf and surf omelet almost two times a week here when they first opened. It was amazing. And then on three different occasions I found a hair in my omelet.  The cooks at the time did not wear hairnets from what I could see. The last time I went in there and ordered it. It had a very fishy smell to it like bad seafood.  My buddy's had the same smell... I sent an email on their website but never got a reply. I would love to start going again if the quality was back to when they first opened....

Wow! Probably the worst experience ever! We called first and said we are snowboarding on Sunday and asked if they offer travel day before and after. And the girl said yes. I told her I was leaving early sat morning and if I could come down Friday end of day?  She said no problem. So we drove all the way down from paradise valley to the store. Got fitted. And was told it's now $50.  I told the guy what I was told on the phone and he tells me no we don't do that.  He went and talked to the owner and he confirmed the same thing. They said sorry but she is NEW and doesn't know any better.  And that they would not honor it after driving all the way down.  While I was telling the employee why that is very unprofessional the owner just sat there one table over and did not step up once or say anything to help the situation.  Very useless and unprofessional. I would not recommend these clowns to anyone.  Useless liars.  It was much better before this idiot took it over.
