Disclaimer: this is only for the bar area and drinks  Came here during the early evening hours before our dinner reservations elsewhere. Seated at the bar we ordered beers and margaritas. Service didn't not disappoint and the drinks were great. The margaritas may be on the pricier side but you get what you pay for. Quality then you don't need quantity! We'd return for drinks next time we are in the area.

Came to this location and couldn't have been more disappointed. We ordered a the register and there was a ton of employees working here. I was so impressed with how efficient things seemed to be running but after ordering we waited, and waited and waited over 25 minutes for a single sandwich. When we asked where our order was, no one knew. We insisted to get a refund since it shouldn't take close to half an hour for a single sandwich. I'm sad we couldn't try Earl of Sandwiches since my extended family spoke so highly of them when they went to Vegas. I guess come here if you have an hour to waste on "fast food".

If I had a choice I would leave no stars to this place. Checking in was a breeze, but everything after that went quite south. We told the front desk at check-in we wanted a quiet room.  We were told facing the pool would be quieter than having a street side room and boy were they ever so wrong! It was a Saturday evening and it was filled with many many college kids in the pool area. This was quite a disappointment after spending close to $200 on a room.  At checkout no charges were confirmed until we looked at our receipt and noticed we were over-charged for cafe goods that we never even ordered.  When we told the person at checkout, we were asked "really, you didn't even order a coffee?" How much more rude could they be?! We were told there was nothing that could be done at that time as the person that does billing is gone for the weekend but rest assured it would be taken care of Monday morning.  Well here we are 3 weeks later and have still not been credited for the charges we never made.  Calling the 1800- number didn't do any good as we were on hold for over 25 minutes and was then told we needed to be transferred elsewhere.  Being Hilton Honor members this is completely unacceptable.  This is the third time that we've been unhappy with Hilton owned hotels and it will be the last time we ever stay in one.  At close to $200 a night, we should be treated way better and at a minimum with high integrity! Bottom line is don't stay here, you will be over charged, over tired and under appreciated. Better look elsewhere!!!
