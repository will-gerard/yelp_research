Caffe Boa used to have the best happy hour on Mill. Looks like they decided to fall into rank and increase some prices over 50%. Might be small peanuts to the bottom line, but I know that our corporate support/location for our own events will now be relocated.   Doesn't help they were out of Mussels too...

As a long time Delux customer (I even have the 10% off VIP silver card) I'm sure to eat here almost a few times a month. You can't be the classic Delux Burger (medium) and a basket of mix fries.   I do want to say that over the past few months however the service has seem to have lost the personal touch and attention to detail I remember. Smiles and warm greetings have been replaced with sometime forgotten orders and rather robotic sever personalities.   Normally that would get a 3-star rating in my book, but there's a special place in my heart for Delux, so they still squeak by with 4.

Have only been here once before under too stressful of circumstances to remember, this trip to Olive and Ivy was fantastic.   Usually going to lunch in Scottsdale is hit or miss with expectations, however today we had a lunch meeting scheduled for 11:30, I got a front row parking spot in front of the valet and had no problem being seated right away.  Sticking to my lunch salad trend, I ordered the Curry Salad with Chicken and couldn't have asked for a more perfect dish on such a warm day. The portions were great, the lettuce cool and crisp and even the "handmade" bread and pesto before complimented everything perfectly.   The only gripe I would have, understanding it is a Fox Restaurant, was how almost unnatural the wait staff was with how rehearsed and methodical all interactions were. Even down to the correct usage of "I am well" versus "I am good" seemed a bit out of place, but not a big deal.

After living in Tempe for 5 years I finally discovered this place just a few years ago and it's been a solid Lunch experience ever since.   I can't say anything for the dinner crowd, but get here before 12pm, order off the lunch menu and you'll have a healthy portion of fresh delicious Mexican food in under 10 minutes.   I normally get the Half-Ass Burro, that comes with an excellent side salad and am stuffed every time I leave.   I can also say for a great strong margarita pull up a seat at the bar, have some chips and enjoy.   Without a doubt this is a perfect break from status-quo fried, rice and beans dishes normally found in the Valley.

First time here for a friend's birthday and I have to say this was a fun, delicious Italian experience. We were in the side room, which worked out perfect for 20ish people in the group and food was served buffet style.   The first impression was with the bread and oil which seemed to be borderline salad dressing with the amount of herbs in it, but nonetheless it was delicious.   The antipasto salad came in a huge plate which was devoured almost immediately and for the main course the lasagna was a simple recipe, "straight up" pasta, sauce and cheese. No frills here and worth it.   The did seem to be a bit slow with the service on water/drinks but nothing to be too concerned about, probably standard for larger groups.

First time ever eating here, got a Gyro Salad for lunch. It's huge, only 6.95 and a great fast meal.   Other stuff looks iffy, so eat at your own risk!

Came here on a Sunday afternoon to meet a friend, about 3:30pm. The place was completely empty, except for a couple sitting outside.   It's great weather so my friend, who already had a starbucks, takes a seat outside as I go into to order an espresso drink.   As I walk up the employee (possibly owner/manager) is clearly checking out my friend outside, very distracted. I order a coffee and receive a robotic reply, "Lattes or Mochas" and hands me a menu. As I try to order again he interrupts me saying that "there is no outside beverages allowed" in reference to my friend. I let him know I'm ordering something but he insists that even so, my friend can't have his coffee.   We leave and walk over to Vincent's (two stores over, a nice Pizza place), where they have no problem with me ordering a drink there and us relaxing outside.   No business + a bad review all over a simple coffee.

I headed over to the BIltmore to kill some time earlier this week and as I walked by Christopher's I saw a Lavazza coffee umbrella outside. This is one of my new favorite brands of coffee and decided to grab a cup on their outside patio. When I walked in I was a little worried that it would be too stuffy as the host was in a vest and tie and I was in shorts and a t-shirt.   Fortunately he was very friendly and I enjoyed an entire French press of Lavazza (putting me pretty close to a heart attack with all the caffeine). Great service, free wi-fi and it was only $5 for what was probably 6 cups of coffee!  Thanks guys!

As a business owner on Mill Ave, I was excited to finally try out Regions for lunch today which is literally a stones throw from our office.   My business partner and I walked over, had a friendly greeting from the staff and were seated right away. I was happy to see that there was actually a good amount of people in the restaurant, something that was hard to know from the street view.   A big fan of salads, I ordered the Grilled House Chicken Salad (I believe the name is correct, might be house grilled chicken salad) and my friend the Fish and Chips.   When the food came out I thought there was an error because there were two scoops of chicken salad, on my salad, where I was really looking for grilled chicken (not a big fan of mayo). What I realized is that I actually had ordered a chicken salad salad, that might contain grilled chicken. As far as how the menu was written I was convinced I was getting grilled chicken.   To the staff's credit, they swapped out the order right away with my next options, a grilled chicken caesar salad, however, it was too fast and I soon realized why. The salad was no more than bagged lettuce and precooked/grilled chicken thrown on top (with croutons, dressing, and grated parmesan cheese tossed on). Not how I want to spend $9.   Maybe it was my fault for trying the salads, but today they were certainly 0/2.  As far as the fish and chips went, I didn't have the fish, but the fries were pretty good.   I'll certainly try them again when I'm not in a salad or lunch mode, but with as times as tough as they are on Mill every detail matters!

I am a 3rd generation Arizonan and seeing hot air balloons rise up from the desert has been a memory since I can remember. 31 years into my life I was finally able to experience balloon flight and I can tell you how incredibly glad I selected FLOAT.   Matt, Olivia and their team provided a one of a kind experience, not just in the hot air balloon but before and after from the moment you arrive to fresh Cartel coffee to a seasonally & local curated breakfast and champagne when you land.   There's no question that I'll be coming back to FLOAT with friends and family in the future. Thank you tremendously!
