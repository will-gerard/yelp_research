This was our favorite neighborhood spot.   Was. The last two times our service has been so terrible it is unbearable. Over thirty minutes to have our order taken. Longer for drinks to be delivered. And a very annoyed condescending server when we asked questions.   There are many places nearby that would be better. We will not be back. So sad to see this place slide into decline.

Stopped in for a quick lunch, and don't regret that decision at all!!  The menu seems really expansive, but all I wanted was chili dog, they have salads, burgers, gyros, etc.   Food was amazing, quick and the owner very nice. Another downtown Phoenix gem!

What is there to say, it is Dunkin' Donuts! There coffee is the best if you are in need of something fast and don't have time to visit a more dedicated coffee shop and their perks program is one of the best around!

Great spot for coffee anytime. Lots of tables and the wifi is okay but sometimes spotty. AC is always cranked so be aware if you don't like to be cold.   Not sure about the other reviews but the line never seems to be outrageous, but if you come during peak times (early morning) expect a little wait. But be realistic, it takes time to make sugary drinks.   The coffee is Starbucks and a bit burnt but get an Americano and it's not half bad.

Edit: I am adjusting the score of my review. The owner contacted me after the fact and explained in detail what happened and the steps taken to take care of it. The problem was solved and in the end this place has a cool feel and is definitely a spot to have a nice drink in the evening away from the normal bar and club scene.  Original Review:  Quick review. Ordered an Irish Coffee. Charged $7 and had to ask multiple times about if it was an Irish Coffee or not as there was absolutely nothing but coffee in the cup. Attitude here, could be a better place if the staff would be more attentive and less concerned about themselves.

2nd time here. Came for a dinner with the parents and wife.  Pretzel bites are amazing and reminded me of a childhood treat. The Beef Short Rib Stew was to die for, as long as you aren't scared of a little fried egg. All around an amazing dinner!!

Great location in downtown. Perfect spot for lunch after church at the AMC theater. Food is very tasty and doesn't take to long to arrive.

I have been here a handful times since opening day, and couldn't be happier with the best coffee house in Phoenix!  The layout and ambiance is perfect! The service is top notch; the owners are the employees and always up for a chat.   If you are hungry, try the chorizo burrito, you won't regret it! And that sums it all up, you won't regret spending your afternoon here and enjoying the best coffee around. (A quick tip: try the Cubano. Having had it growing up it is made perfectly!)

What a place!  My wife and I came here for our 1st Anniversary. Having made the reservation on open table I added the note that it was a special occasion.   We were greeted with complimentary champagne and a custom made salad. Our server Justis was fantastic. Walking us through the menu and offering great suggestions.   The food was mind-blowing. The BBQ ribs are the best I have ever tasted. So tender it does just fall off the bone. The fries were a nice side and rounded off the meal very well. In short everything we ordered was great!  And last but not least was the amazing desert. The chocolate creme brûlée, enough for two and so tasty it left us wanting to come back just for that alone.   Blue Hound has become our new favorite spot, and we will cherish this meal for years as it was the most memorable way to spend our 1st wedding anniversary. Even got a signed card from the entire staff. Just amazing!

Quick review to say that this is the shop of Downtown. Came in during a lunch brake and sat down for about an hour with Ben. He went over all there is to know about getting into Vaping and the different Mods, Batteries, and tanks.   Their juice collection and fact they have an actually bar to taste and sample sets this place apart. Check them out for sure if you want to learn what this is all about or if you want to just grab a new flavor.

The facility is nice and clean and appears new. The sales staff is nice and friendly and the prices seem very reasonable.   The main problem here is the range check-in staff. We were told there was one lane open and then a wait. We took the open lane for a group of 5 and thought we were lucky. The lanes on both sides were open and unused the entire time. I stepped out to let the staff know and see if we could split and use two lanes. I was told no, that they were currently used. The staff has cameras and can see that they are not. When challenged politely that they lanes in fact were not being used the staff behind the counter seemed annoyed and rebuked the suggestion that they were open.   This left the impression that they artificially creating wait times. During our entire time there 4 of the available 8 lanes in our area were open and not being used. They were not damaged or broken either.  So if you have to go here press the staff on lanes. Make sure you aren't being made to wait for no reason. There are other places to shoot and perhaps you should go elsewhere.

I decided to give C2 another chance and boy I am glad I did! The staff this time was very helpful and explained everything clearly and answered all our groups questions. Felt completely different than before and I will certainly be back again.

Wow, this place is the best. Dina, the owner and instructor is top class in her field and such and amazing person! My wife and I have been here a few times and keep coming back because it is way too fun! Perfect for a birthday party of just a date night out. This place is truly better than the rest and should try it out!

Wife and I came here for a Friday night dinner, arriving just before happy hour ended. The deals for happy hour are quite good, $3 beer and $4 wine plus a handful of starters at the $5 mark.   The place wasn't full at all and the service was somewhat slow but acceptable as it wasn't bothersome either. Our server recommended some dishes one of which I ordered and loved. Something about short ribs and curry made it amazing!   The atmosphere is nice and open and not too loud. I would come back here again as the food was great!

So glad this place has moved into the area, tons of parking and a nice clean shop once inside!  They are extremely helpful as I stopped in during my lunch break to replace a cracked plastic EVOD tank. Ended up getting some juice as well after spending some time sampling the wide array that they offer. One criticism, the sample area is self-serve and kind of just attached to the wall. I have been to some other shops that have a more bar approach which gives the employees a chance to truly explain each juice and have a more interactive approach that I enjoy.   As they have only been open for a few months I am excited to see how they grow! But definitely stop by if you are in the neighborhood.

AMAZING!!! There is only one way to describe this place and that is it.  I have toured a bunch of the stores in AZ, and this one is by far the best. The most open, clean and bright layout I have seen! They have almost anything you could be looking for as far as hardware and their juice selection is way beyond anything I have seen yet.   They have a complete and separate "Bar" area for tasting, which is exactly how it should be. You are given numerous menus from all the different Juice makers, none of which are the usual main ones you find every where else. And then something even better happens, you are personally assisted as you sit there and enjoy flavors until you find what you are looking for, and it isn't a pushy sales thing but a rather a friendly discussion about what you are into and suggestions to try something unique.   So yes try this place, and then don't go anywhere else! They have it down to a science here as to how to treat a customer right! I am glad I came by and will be back soon. (And for sure I want to buy to ProVari, but that will have to wait...)

Had to write a review. We spent last Sunday driving around trying to get a new kit and juice for family member who was interested in getting into Vape. Went to a few shops that had pool tables and all that going on but few hardware choices. This place had exactly what we were looking for.   I had purchased my EVOD starter kit in CA the week before at an amazing shop, hopefully we see that level here soon. But Kevin has the knowledge and service to bypass any shortcoming in the look of the place. (Display cases were packed and a little disorganized). The price was a shock, a complete $20 cheaper than I paid. Dang CA prices.   The juice bar needs a little spruce up, but flavors are great and had to pick up another Suicide Bunny.   I will be back, and according to Kevin there are installing some TVs for football season so maybe the entire place will see a makeover soon.

This place is amazing! The location is just on the south end of the main area that is Downtown Chandler. (Next to a pretty darn good Thai food place as well). I am not sure what was here previously, but it is evident from the inside that a lot of work and effort went into the planning and design of the space.   I sizable espresso bar is right up front when you walk in and there are plenty of additional seating areas as well. A good number of plugs and free wifi make this a great place to enjoy some of their coffee and get some work done as well.  On the coffee front, it is very good and roasted on site! Their menu is what you would expect from a roaster coffee house, which means focused on the actual coffee and not a bunch of sugary add-ins.   I didn't try the handful of pastries that they have, but judging by the looks of them they are sure to be great!! This will be a new local spot for me for sure! Goodbye SB! Hello great coffee!!
