I really love this place, I didn't realize how big it was. You could have a large group for a party. The parking is actually pretty genius since it's off the freeway it gets congested do to avoid that when you leave, they have you exit out the back to avoid car accidents. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good Mexican food, it is spicy but very delicious

I love to come here and use the dog wash. It's really smart to do that. It's really hard to bathe them at home in the tub because they won't stay still and get water all the over the bathroom. Plus, you don't make your bathtub all dirty

We had a horrible experience here yesterday. They stop serving breakfast at 11am, we got there about 20 minutes before that. We asked before putting our name in if we could still order breakfast and they told us yes. We get seated and took our drink order we were told someone else would take our order. We waited 15 minutes and Natalie never came to us, we even all had a refill on our beverages. 11:06am came around and finally Natalie came to us to take our order and told us we were too late for breakfast. We told her that the hostess said we could still order breakfast. She had to go talk to someone and came back saying no we cannot order breakfast. She put all the blame on the management. I could see her attending to another table behind us, there were about 8 in their party and there were 6 of us. She could have at least came to us before 11am to put the order in before breakfast was done being served. She looked like she could have been on drugs to tell you the truth, she was shaking and scratching her skin. I'm glad we left and didn't eat there. She really should have apologized to us instead of blaming the restaurant. The only reason why I gave 1 star is because she ended up giving us a free pie for our inconvenience.

Been coming here since I was a little kid and the quality of the food is the best! I brought family from Seattle here and they were kind of skeptical until they saw the food, their eyes got all big at the way it looked and they said there were the best wings and pizza they've ever had when they've come to visit us. They defiantly want to come here again the next time they visit. They get jealous of the pics I post of the food I get now that they're back home

This place was terrible!! I've been coming here for about 10 years and never been disappointed until tonight. I took my 4 year old cousin here and most of the games were busted. We lost tokens and they didn't give them back to us. The place was super dirty, half eaten pieces of pizza on the games. The bathrooms were dirty, there were no paper towels. I will not be coming back here. Again, kids working at this place. Where are all the adult workers? They need some serious training on how to properly maintain this business or no one will be coming back.

Omg! This is like the best Chinese food. I love it so much! I bring in some friends and family members with me and always get the best food! I used to order from here when I worked in Sun City back in the late 90's early 2000's it's the same goodness. I wish they would expand and put a restaurant in Glendale, till they do I'll continue going back lol

I go to this place is the best and biggest buffet. I come here every time I visit Vegas and it never gets old. I like to take my time and just try a little bit of everything.

I had the worst experience here. It took a long time just for someone to seat us. No one even greeted us to say someone will be with you. We finally were seated and took a long time for our waitress to come and ask us for our drink order. Then we did not see her for about another 5 minutes to take our order. It felt like it took about an hour for our food to come. She did not offer us refills nor did she give us napkins or silverware, we had to ask for everything. The waitress never came back to the table to check on us to see if everything was ok. We had to ask another waitress to get our waitress for refills, she didn't come to the table she just brought them and slammed them down and walked off. This place needs to either hire friendlier waitresses or do better training. There were too many teenagers just standing around and talking rather than checking on their customers. We had to complain to the manager to let her know what was going on. Our waitress came to our table and cleared our plates and said we were getting our meal compt and then walked off again. No apologies from her, just attitude. We got the check and only half was taken, never coming back to this place. My poor mother took it personally, like we were not good enough to serve. The food wasn't even that good, very disappointed in this place!

I came here because they were the only in network place I could go to that's open on Saturdays which is nice for someone who works Monday through Friday. The only thing about going in there is that you smell cleaning solution that is good for a doctor office, but then they go get food for lunch and both of those smells together make you wanna puke. The doctor and staff are very nice!

I'm disappointed in the Applebee's franchise altogether. About 10 years ago it was like the best place to go for food and drinks. Now it sucks balls! They took away the veggie patch pizza and the grande nachos. Now they only have a select amount of appetizers for half off. What a rip off! I doubt if I'll ever eat at this franchise again, there are better places to go with better food. Even the drink I had was weak, very disappointing

This place isn't all that, the food was low quality for high prices and the whole place really needs to be deep cleaned. The outside of it is really cool, kind of a beachy atmosphere with beach volley ball and horse shoes. The tables inside were dirty the TV inside looks like there was dried on blood running down. The only reason I went was because of Groupon, that's the last time I do that. I went last winter on a Wednesday for happy hour and got 10 cents wings, I guess if I ever go back it'll only be on a Wednesday.

I came to meet a friend here since I was visiting from California and brought my one month old baby. I had to use the restroom to change baby and when I opened the changing table a bunch of green flakes came flying down and onto the table, which to me looked like marijuana. I told my waitress, she just apologized and said she was going to tell the manager. The manager did not come to our table to apologize and tell us that they were going to take care of it and thank you for letting them know. I have never been to a place where the manager does not take responsibility for something that they are managing!

Wow!! I was blown away by this place! I've come by this place a few times when going to the movies and always smelled delicious. Tonight after seeing a movie, I decided to try this out with my family and I have to say the food was really good! The meat was delicious and the servings are HUGE! I would defiantly recommend this place to others and come back here. It's so worth it

I came in last Thursday to have a mani/pedi done. I really liked the girl who did my pedicure, she was able to replicate the picture I showed her of the nail design I wanted. It was nice to sit and relax and watch Netflix there. She had an appointment come in and wasn't able to do my mani so the other girl did it. I showed her the same picture and she went off and did her own design, I told her a couple of times the nail polish on my toes were sponged on, she said that her way was better. She painted them pink and then added the blue on top, the instead of doing cheetah, she did some swirls. I told her again it didn't look right and she insisted it was. Well, I got home and 2 of the tip color popped off, then the next day 2 more just popped off. I called and to see if they could fix it and I was able to go in on Saturday. The girl who did my pedicure fixed them, I told her that and didn't sponge them and the design doesn't look like cheetah at all. I thought she was going to remove the polish and redo it, no she just fixed the blue at the tips of my nails. She told me that she wasn't going to charge me this time but they don't guarantee the polish, just the gel. I thought that was kind of rude because I didn't peel it off myself or did it on purpose but it felt like they thought I did. Well, I left and the next day the paint on my pinky finger came all the way off. Then my index finger on my other hand. I google it to see why that would happen, because the explanation I got was the wear and tear of washing dishes and my hair or doing yard work would cause it. I didn't do any of the above driving my car home when it first popped off. So Google said its because the top coat didn't dry all the way and too many coats were added, also the nails weren't buffed or the polish could be old. Nothing on there about yard work or anything else. It sucks because I dropped $75 including tip and it didn't last an hour. I've never had this happen before and I'm gonna stick with the place that I normally go too, even though it's about an hour away from my home. I don't like when people don't apologize that this happened or take responsibility for what they didn't do properly and putting the blame on me. Too bad, I really liked this place but I'm not going back

I come here as much as possible, never tastes the food but I love the boba drinks. I try to get a different one every time and haven't been disappointed in any of them. My new favorite is the Jackfruit-oh so good! I wish it was bigger because it gets so busy on the weekends, you'll see a line out the door. It's cute that they have games for you to play with the family. I highly recommend this place!

I've been coming here for a few months and they've blown my mind every time! I follow all the nail arts pages on Instagram and Facebook, I can show Marie a picture and she makes it happen on my fingers and toes. Andy is really good at painting my nails and gave the best pedicure tonight. Grace did a fabulous job on my full set, she is so sweet because I told her that anywhere else I've had them done, they've made my cuticles bleed and burned them because they were going so fast with the drill. She kept asking me if I was ok and making sure she was going at a slow speed so she didn't hurt me. The first time I leave a nail shop and don't have red nicks around my nails, thank you! They're so nice to me as soon as I walk in they call me by my actual name and not just call me "lady", always making sure I'm comfortable and if I need water. The manager Larry even makes coffee every day if you prefer. I live in Glendale and travel to Chandler for work and I'm so glad that I've found this shop, I will continue coming here and recommend all family and coworkers to come here, too!

Always great chicken here. This place is nice and clean, just sad that this area is bad that they have to give you the code to the bathroom on the receipt.

I'm not a big AMC fan, I like going to Harkins because they have cheaper prices. If there's a movie that I want to see that's going to be huge like Jurassic World because I can reserve my seat without having to wait in a long line and fight for seats. It seems like every time I come to this theatre, it's nasty. Nothing is clean, the soda machine was out of ice and a lot of soda selections. I went to the restroom and all of the sinks were out of soap. I went to an employee to let them know, they said they'd take care of it, after my movie was over I visited the restroom again and the soap dispensers were still out, the stalls were out of toilet paper and the soda machines were still out of soda and ice. It's like there are a bunch of teenagers taking care of the whole place, there didn't seem to be anyone working over the age of 19. There needs to be a few adults there to make sure they're fully stocked for their customers, or people will stop going there. Im think I'm gonna stick with Harkins, I've never had a problem with them, they always fix anything that is not working and the bathrooms are always clean and well stocked!

Ok, so I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I LOVE Pour Jo so much! The Italian soda is bomb, especially now that it's summer and the prickly pear iced tea is Yummy!! I also live on the west side and get anxious and excited for when they drive all the way down here. I make sure I invite all my family and friends to come with me, they've had the coffee and love it! The owners are super sweet and will help you with ordering if your coffee illiterate like I am lol.
