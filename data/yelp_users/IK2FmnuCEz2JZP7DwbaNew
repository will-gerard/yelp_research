If you're looking for a real QUALITY BARBER come here and see my man Boris.  He's a Russian dude with a great personality that will indeed give you a great cut.  I've been a regular of his for several years now and he always takes care of me, he always goes above and beyond your basic cut... Have him trim your eyebrows (both of them, lol) and your beard if you're sporting one.  Boris is the real deal, he know's what he's doing!  Call ahead, sometimes he gets busy but he'll fit you in.  p.s. - Tell him Josh sent you

So I signed up with Massage Envy several months ago and I've been to a few of their different locations but I seem to like this one the most.  I've never had the same massage therapist twice but after my most recent experience with Kelly (cute girl too) I'll be sure to schedule my massage only when she's available.  I went in for a deep tissue full body massage and she was very professional and exceeded my expectations.  It's important that I stress how good she is,  every massage therapist has their own technique... you can literally get 10 different deep tissue massages from 10 different massage therapists so you need to find one you like, and you'll know when you do.  It was truly a great way to start my weekend.  I hate when people mock me for going to massage envy like it's a cheap or crappy place to go for a massage... I mean come on, really??  It all depends on the the massage therapist, not the price or establishment!  I'm a paying member, monthly dues are roughly $50 and that gets you 1 massage a month... however if you don't use it, it will rollover into the next month.  For a 1 hour massage people generally tip $10-20 however I tipped Kelly $25 for doing such an excellent job.

Best Chinese food I've found in AZ, and I'm from MI (Michigan has the best Chinese food) so that's saying something.  You can't go wrong with the General Tso's Chicken with Fried Rice... but, my favorite thing on the menu is the Beef Sticks.  Good sized portions and affordable prices too!

I absolutely LOVE Bandera!  I've never had a bad meal from the this place and the service is always great.  My favorite thing to order (which is actually not on the menu) is the BBQ Beef Ribs, they are AMAZING!  Cooked to perfection so they just fall off the bone.  Also, you have to try the side of Mac & Cheese, you wont regret it, I promise.  The prices here are not bad either... dinner for two will run you about $100 with tip.  It's a great place to take a date.

Nothing Epic... I've had better from this location in the past. (4 yrs ago) Took 40 minutes to get a mediocre pepperoni mushroom pizza deliverd for $16 + tip.

When I lived in Scottsdale I would eat here almost once a week. The food is awesome, literally, EVERYTHING is awesome. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. The owners are so kind too, I miss those healthy meals!

So I stopped in here because Vietnamese food is generally one of my absolute favorites, however this place failed on every avenue.  I walked in and was barely greeted after wandering around for a minute... I put in a simple order of Chicken fried rice to go then she walked away leaving me in the middle of the restaurant so I went and had a seat at the front door.  This place isn't to well organized for walking in and ordering food to go.  So I waited about ten minutes and then went out to my car for maybe 5 minutes and when I came back in I saw a to-go box sitting near the hostess counter which I assumed was my order... after waiting another 10 minutes or so the waitress (who wasn't busy) came over and asked me to pay, which I did... then she handed me my cold food.  Waiting approximately 30 minutes for an $11 order of chicken fried rice was kinda shitty considering there were only a total of 4 customers in the entire restaurant.  When I got home to eat my food I wasn't very impressed with the portion size for the money and the food was so bland to top it off!  There wasn't much of anything I could do to doctor it up so I reheated my cold flavorless meal and ate as is.  NOT IMPRESSED  FYI, the best place for Vietnamese food in my opinion is Noodles Ranch located @ the SE Corner of Thomas & Scottsdale road in Scottsdale.  Their food is to die for!  Less expensive, more authentic and full of flavor with the friendliest wait staff you could ask for.  It's 100% worth the drive no matter where you live.  So, if you like Pho Da Lat... do yourself a favor and go try Noodles Ranch.

Well, it's just Wendy's... but this one has a very cool, as modern as it gets fountain drink machine.  AND the staff is always friendly and their breakfast food is the bomb!  If you haven't had a Wendy's breakfast, try it!

I just stopped in to check out The Native since it's so close to my house. (conveniently located at the southwest corner of Tatum & Bell next to Wangs & Rubios).  This place is very modern looking and much trendier than a Native New Yorker,  loaded with plenty of HD TV's so you won't have to worry about getting a seat with a nice view of the game. They have 12 beers on tap a decent selection of liquor and even a small selection of wine for the ladies. The food is good, I recommend the traditional wings since you can get them grilled or fried. The boneless are okay but I prefer them with a dry rub seasoning,  I just wish they had more than three (dry rub) flavors. The burgers are good but not the best thing in the menu so try a yummy pizza or something else that looks appetizing... you really can't go wrong! The #1 reason I will be back though is the service, Alexa is phenomenal and will soon be running this place if she sticks with it a couple years. She's just a bar-back right now but she clearly pulls all of the weight fur the crew, she chats with everyone and never screws up an order, you can tell she really cares that you're having a great experience. If the management reads this review you better give this girl a raise because you can't afford to lose her!
