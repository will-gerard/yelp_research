Outstanding food.  Get over the wait people.  That's what happens in a desperate-for-culture town like Phoenix gets a few good places to eat.  You think they complain about this in cities that have a soul?   The waffle-outstanding.  Hashbrowns- best ever.  Bacon-great.   Its local, its fresh and its unique.

What a dissapointment when you see such an exciting menu, unable to make a choice then you are served frozen hashbrowns and low quality ingrediants.  The chicken fried steak was consumed by a porky/ smoke flavor. The service was friendly and charming but I can't get over the dissapointment in food quality.

There's only a handful in Phoenix that I crave.  The Herb Box is one of them.  Every time I go, I strive to try new item to taste test.  NEVER disappointed.  Trout, Short Ribs, Thai Ribs, Smoked Gouda Mac, The Beets!  I mean this place makes you crave the sides.  The sides?  Not to mention an amazing wine list.  The service is always personal and engaging.  Looking forward to their new PV location!  Now if they will just come downtown!

My wife and I loved everything about our experience at NOCA.   I want to congratulate the culinary team on showcasing high quality ingredients , crafted in a delicate, thoughtful way.  The amuse-bouche, cotton candy and parting treat round out an amazing tasting menu.  The passion shows.  Keep up the good work, keep pushing the envelope and be proud.  We will be back.  Hopefully soon.

The pizza crust is perfect and the roasted tomatoes on the Margherita compliment so well.  Pair this with a glass (or two) of the Penelope Sanchez red and will you be a happy camper.  The real star here may be the bowl of clams.  You'll find yourself mopping up that broth with their bread as long as your stomach has room.  Their staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  They are passionate about the beverage offerings and it really rounds out an excellent experience.
