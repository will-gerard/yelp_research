Went in at 2:30 on a Tuesday and the service was SLOW despite having very few customers inside or in the drive thru.  I ordered a salad with no cheese and it came out covered in cheese. Pesto panini had very little pesto and was flavorless. The portions were small for the price. Several dirty tables throughout the indoor dining room. We were going to try cookies but after waiting for what felt like forever for the one customer in front of us to be helped I gave up. Save your money and drive down to Wildflower.

Stopped in for a quick dinner that wasn't a burger joint. The Asian wrap was fantastic. I ordered with Chicken and I didn't love the chicken but I am very particular about meat. I'll be back to try other options. Staff was friendly and service was fast.
