My friends go to the free buffet most Fridays after classes so I joined them. I was excited because they rave about how good the food is and the drinks are cheap!  HOWEVER....the buffet was set outside on the patio where it was freezing so the food was cold and gross.   Why would you put uncovered hot dishes outside. Sternos cant keep up with that. I guess starving students are less likely to notice cold food??  I would rather pay than eat that buffet again.  Makes me wonder how their regular quality and care to food temps is.  Not excited to try that again. Cute outside space, games and places for dogs. Spring may be a better time to enjoy this venue

JOY JOY JOY!!   Why would you pay upwards of $4 for quality fresh bread when you can go here and get it for $1-$2.50?  Its not day old....I got bread today 12/12 and its good till 12/20. That's 8 days of goodness left!  *White, wheat, sourdough, whole grain, multi grain bread *Thomas English Muffins * Hostess doughnuts,  mini doughnuts 4/ $1.  *Bake and serve dinner rolls *Tortillas.  You name it they have it.  Too many other things to mention.  Go and see it for yourself  Who needs to eat extra carbs at full price when you can get em cheap!!  The staff is helpful and will point out extra goodies of the day or show you where the REALLY fresh stuff is.  If you need to bring snacks for the kids' holiday party, baseball team after game snacks come here and save TONS!!

This is the best Thai food I've found in Phoenix, and I've been to Thailand several times. Spice level "hOt" is just right. My nose is running :-) Green curry has great crunchy veggies, Thai tea is nice and lunch specials are under $10.

I love this off strip hotel. Not fancy but well kept. Great prices and a reasonable "resort fee". Asia checked us in at the front desk and was super friendly and helpful.   When we don't stay on the Strip, we stay here in the tower rooms. Modern and clean.

As you know,  i'm spoiled by living in the Bay Area and Tokyo. I've had amazing food and its not always expensive, usually not. I just expect quality and care in any dish.  I was craving Thai food and went to Thai Rama  on a recommendation based on dinner my sister had there 3 years ago. I always order Thai Beef Salad at a new Thai spot...sort of a litmus test. It wasn't my favorite.   Loads of onions, no tomato and no cucumber and no mint. The spice level was nice, good flavor. The beef was way over cooked and far from the medium rare juicy I expect.  I'm not sure I will be back

The staff here is so friendly and caring. The hygienist, Suzanne, was very gentle and made my cleaning a pleasant and fairly quick experience.  ( ^_^) I'll be back for sure!

Dr Nester was so kind and gentle. I came in nervous and in pain so he made sure I was comfortable while doing my exam. NO PAIN! =)  Afterwards he made his recommendations for treatment. The staff is also very nice. Yolanda helped set up my treatment plan. I'll be back for my crown in just 10 days!  Highly recommended.

okay...where to start. I drive past this spot every day, and it is always busy!  WOW! I'm thinking this place must be hella good Mexican to be so busy. I gotta try that place sometime.  My friend gave me a gift card so I went alone for a lunch/ test drive. I was excited! I ordered the most expensive item on the menu. Steak and Chicken Fajitas $14.95 and ala carte chicken enchilada.  I should have left when there was a hair in my salsa but I know shit happens and let it go back with the server.  Here come my Fajitas!!  SIZZLING platter of 90% ONIONS.  ONIONS!!  I had to dig for the few scraps of beef jerky and boiled chicken. I'm not kidding. And I did make a tortilla and try it......one bite was too much.   Well, at least I had my enchilada right? I was so bland that it couldn't have been more than boiled chicken...no seasoning at all.  The worst meal of my life.  I tipped the poor server 20% figuring she had a hard enough life working there.  I will never go back

Beautiful location, nice spot for meeting friends around the pool.   I've stayed here before I lived in Phoenix, my sister had her wedding reception here and my family always stays here when they visit.  The location makes it sweet, not the hectic rush you find in Scottsdale or Tempe...just 15 min from downtown Phoenix, just zip down 7th street and avoid all the highway mess.  The rooms are really nice but quite small so check into internet specials for upgrades you can get at check-in.  Pay in advance to save a pretty penny! (^_^)b  Ask for the room that overlooks the Falls...the pool area.

A welcome surprise of a little hole in da wall kinda place. Super friendly owners, Zoe and Jeff were happy to share their story and suggest flavors...they have 50! Soft melty shaved ice, just like the fluffy ice you find in Japan or Hawai'i. Its also the first place that offers the sweetened condensed milk on top. Perfect.  The only trouble is, they are so hidden. Look for the big rolled down sun shade with OPEN spray painted on it. They usually have a big wooden sign in the parking lot as well.  Its easy to miss, but look for it!! Its worth the tasty and refreshing treat. (^_^)b

Lively and fun, valet parking and nice prices. Friendly staff who will stop and take pix for you too. $20 gets ya a bottle of wine....and not the cheap stuff...AND a board of 4 huge bruschetta. Your choice of 10 different toppings. I love the one with fig and goat cheese.  Tuesday and Wednesday evenings after 8pm for this deal. Easy to split 2 deals with 3 peeps.

Can't get enough of Postino's! Monday night, Wine & Boards, just $20! The best deal in Phoenix! We love the green apple and brie, prochutto and fig, bruschetta are amazing.  Try the Postino select wines. Delicious

Try this place! I thought it was important for you to know that I got to experience a therapeutic massage with Eddie today. He was so good! He was kind, checked the pressure levels often and was able to accommodate my special needs after my surgery.That was my 3rd and best massage I've ever had at Massage Haven.   Always clean with a true spa feel, relaxing music and friendly staff.  I recommend the $35 a month membership. It's really just a credit for a massage next month. That gets you a full hour by the way.  Keep up the good work!

What a cool place. Our server Liz was so friendly and knowledgeable. She made our experience wonderful. Thanks for the recommendations today.   Sopaillas were tasty and the cheese crisp was crunchy and really BIG! Our tostada was packed to overflowing with goodness. Margaritas by Brendon were delicious    Fun, casual and friendly neighborhood place. Open till 2am.

FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN  .....SO,  what's good? I'm guessing the fried chicken. Crispy skin, juicy on the inside, perfect spices. My mom would have to try hard to keep up here...sorry mom, but it's really good!  The pork baby back ribs were excellent too. I wasn't fired up about any of the sides except the fresh veggies and you can get a double side of them.  I wanna go there right now!

I've been to heaps of these yogurt places and man...after a long day this will take your stress away (^_^)/ Clean, bright and long...but fast moving....lines.  The Birthday Cake yogurt is my favorite. Be sure not to pick lots of heavy fruit or other heavy toppings...thats where u will pay the most.  Look for coupons in the Val-u-Pack envelopes in the mail. Save 20% with the coupon.

Let me start by saying that having come from the San Francisco Bay Area...I'm spoiled by all the awesome choices for food and services. But being new to Phoenix, it's been a challenge to find all the good stuff. I hope my YELP's will help other newbies  (^_^)  I must have tried no less that 7 nail salons before I found Oceans. This place is great. They have 10 spa pedi chairs and 8 nail tables as well as a cute nail drying station for your toes.  THE best pedi I've ever had, anywhere. There is no timer on the pedi, or the massage. They take the time they need to satisfy each client. I've had 6 or 8 different girls and they were all really good.  I also use them to do my gel nails too. I'm a little surprised that in Phoenix they charge extra fro the gel coat, but I guess that's what they do.   Overall, good prices and the service is excellent!  $$$  Discount for cash!!   $$$

Love Motown Mondays!  Lively even on Monday, we enjoy the funky and cool vibe of this old brick building..  Live music 7 nights a week gives you lots of chances dancing!   Try the mini churos, yummy!

Dr Stavoe was super nice and friendly. He took his time and gave me additional shots to make sure I was numb for my root canal. I was pretty nervous and he kept smiling and made me comfortable. He was able to save my tooth even though it was pretty tricky. I'll be back to replace my old fillings with pretty new natural ones! All the staff were happy to help and all very professional! Highly recommended!

The food and service are fine but to be right next to University of Phoenix stadium... And support SEAHAWKS ONLY.....on game day, is a shame. We were there before the game and felt really uncomfortable and unwelcome due to rude Seahawks fans.  ** Sandbar is a fine example of doing it right. They have a Packers section but staff wear their favorite teams jerseys. Every team fan feels welcome.

Very excited to have such a fun downtown location for sushi      Same excellent menu as the original Pure Sushi in N Scottsdale! Good happy hour and great value.   We enjoyed the Pure Asian Pear Martini and ice cold Sapporo. Fire dragon and the White Monster rolls were tasty and fresh. Ask for fresh Wasabi on the side, great alternative to the usual green stuff.   Clinton and Phil were very friendly and helpful. Thanks for creating such an amazing interior design too. We're looking forward to more original art work.
