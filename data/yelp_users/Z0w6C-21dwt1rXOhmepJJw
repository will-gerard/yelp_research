What can i say? i am a smutty bitch..Been to all the seedy places in town an then some..Ok, so your a middle class man, married, your wife NEVER puts out, what is a man to do???  Hummmm  BANDAIDS...   Disco!!   I am telling you i have never in my life seen more cocks out in one room at the same time..  the girls, gritty an down an dirty in more than one way!!  But hey!!  the smell in the bar is a mix of that really bad stuff you could buy in the bathrooms and put on yourself to smell good and then straight up cum buckets..  Yeah really...  But i think for 10 buck and the investment of a condom you may have a VERY nice evening..I am sure you will leave with empty balls!!  And there is NOTHING wrong with that...  I saw blow jobs, grinding with cock going in an out{ i did not see the investment of a condom on that certain person, hummm?}  a few hand finishes here an there...  I would say DRINK before you go fer sure!!  good times to be had for all...

OK, so yeah i am goin there!! well actually i have all ready been there and back! this is the place to be, really it is, no not for the drinks but for the view, it's all about the view and the best 10 dollars you will spend in a 3 minute time span... i do not recommend going to the vip, why you ask/ welll, because for 10 bucks your still gonna get grind-ed on, boobs in your face and prob walk out with a load in your shorts.. maybe even a hand up your shorts if you sit on the end against the wall and your a perv an wear super short shorts!Yep, really!! There  all different styles of girls to choose from, tattooed, tits on a stick, average, beautiful, girl next door, beauty is all over the place!! Go, take your girl then go home and do the dirty....

What can i say about this spot...I love it, have seen some of the best rockabilly there is! And some kick ass blues along the way. This is defiantly a good date takin place, because the music is always lusty and makes you wanna grind on someone in a slow good not slutty way! and if you are single there are always a boatload of pretty people to look at... this reminds me of going back in time whenever i can go see a good show here...

OK, i love the Barrio, but really it is due to there sangria an homemade table side guacamole food is good but i think it is a little pricey for what you get to be honest... it can get loud and hard to hear whom your dining with at times and if you do have to waitI pity you especially right now when it is hot...Go for a late nite sangria or 3!! an some home made guacamole, good for that, ohhh or if your into Tequila they have the BEST selection in town

This place is the best, hands down...  I give much LOVE and respect for Tad the owner, he cuts hair like no one else i know in the world..His hands move in a way so fast you cannot even see thim, Tad scissorhands of the business! I used to work for him, when the place was by the library back in the day.. He was sweet, caring, amazing, and taught me a lot... He runs a business like he would love his family, deeply.. All the other ppl i worked with were sweet an warm as well.. I say go, an tell ALL your friends, your hair will love you, everyone will wanna be you and you will feel sexy as hell... Plus it is a fun place to be, lots to look at...My kinda place hands down..

Sunnyslope is near an dear to my heart. i lived in a great home at the END of central ..it was a mid century style home, kinda reminded me of a Ralph Haver home...The slope is like any other hood it has the good,bad an ugly...I was lucky an lived in a great little area..Back in the day it was known for the TB sanitariums, crazy huh, ppl from all over the us came to the slope to get better...I always felt safe an walked the dogs late into the nite, plus there is a great was a great mountain right across from where i lived that i could walk up, it used to be someones home but burned down, it was kinda creepy{ i like creepy things,places} but it had the BEST view ever... Got to see tons of wild animals all the time, big plus...

I am a huge fan!!! This place is amazing in SO many ways, first of all the staff rocks! second it is doggy friendly, i love places like that reminds me of being in Europe.. then i have to move on to the cocktail's, yummy!!!! really!!!  And the building is close to my heart! always hs been... I am not putting the food down, it was good, i had some fish with a very nice coconut curry sauce an it came with white rice an coleslaw, umm i was not a fan of the slaw but hey that's really all i can say bad about this place..It is also a great place to ppl watch, every variety of life to be had! i could go there have cocktails on the patio by myself and one of my many dogs an be as happy as i could ever be i think!

I know I know i reviewed Hula already, but i can only give them 5 stars at a time and i feel they deserve 100 plus!  It was my birthday yesterday and my pick of places to go so i picked Hula! i LOVE, love, love this place. i was lucky girl got the same waitress from before, and her name is Ginger, ask for her, beautiful, on the money with service and sweet as can be. though i am sure all the staff is like that.  I got to meet the owner Dana, he is the warmest, sweetest man alive, really! i adore him!  We sat outside it was beautiful, the patio had a great mix of all kinds of people, i love that, and someone had there doggy there and i really LOVE that part! I had drinks of course and there is no better place in town for drinks, hands down! They are strong, sweet and will make you go home and do dirty birdy stuff for sure!  Dinner!!! AMAZING!!!  I ordered fish and picked it prepared jerk style, it was sooo good, i have never had jerk style sauce but highly recommend it. it came with rice and plantains and some thing called johnny cakes i think? it was kinda like cornbread but even better i could eat it everyday!  My b/f got the jerk chicken it was so tender and moist and all the flavors blended well together, amazing, i may have to get that next time!  We also had a half order of sweet potato fries before dinner, HEAVEN!! and a half order was HUGE, we took some home with us as well as some of our dinner. the sauce that comes with them is sweet and tangy, get them!!!  We also had banana cream pie. it is not like the kind you get in the store It was so damn good! it had a half graham cracker half chocolate bottom, then the banana cream part and bananas on top, my mouth was happier than it had ever been!  Everyone NEEDS to go here, you will love it and walk away feeling full and part of a caring family.  This is hands down my favorite place to go in Arizona!  Ohh and i have yet to try Sunday brunch but am planning on it very soon! i wanna take doggies with so they can enjoy as well!  Say Hi to Dana while your there he will treat you so good, he took VERY good care of me, Thanks buddy!!xoxoxox  Go, right now! this second, ~   ALSO..For the reviewer Patti S....   Harsh, harsh, harsh..I had the Same DRINKS YOU HAD AND THEY WERE FAR FROM BITTER..REALLY? BLOOD ORANGE HAPPENS TO BE ON THE SOUR OR AS YOU PUT IT BITTER SIDE..And the Pinapple taste was there, i had PLENTY of drinks and i tasted it..  There is no way that you can even begin to say the rice was screwed up, really/ i had the same rice you had and it was perfect, maybe because it was not made from a boil in bag you did not realize what REAL rice is..  Please people disregard patty's review, it was her first one, and she is a snowbird from probably south Dakota this place is rocking and happening, and anyways who uses the word ucky/ i would not trust a review from someone \that is that bland..Yeah go back to Trader Vic's nothing like a nice chain restaurant, maybe hit Denny's in the am for breakfast...I give it 100 plus stars....you wanted to try something real and not a casserole and you were far from your safety zone Patti s, that's all, plain and simple...

OMG!!! I thought I died and went to booze HEAVEN.. Seriously, this place is huge and has everything you need to get over a bad day, bitchy wife or mean husband!! I love me some vodka and they have every kind, flavor you could imagine. i prefer a brand called VIeL..it is 5 timese distilled and comes in a bunch of flavores, it is only 10 bucks, i know your thinkin I am one to maybe buy bottem shelf stuff but far from the truth cheap stuff equals a bad next day ALL DAY for this girl.. go in try it ohh an if you just so happen to be a Hello Kitty fan they have Hello Kitty champagne!!! i love her.. you will be in this store for a long time... Plus they offer free tastings

I cannot say anything but how Amazing this little place is. It was a franchise spot then the guy decieded to move and handed the keys back over to the origanial owners Andy and Kim. The food is all fresh made, never sits under a heat lamp, and is made when you order it. It used to be taco's and burro's mostly, and the price is right on! 5 bucks for a pound size burro of your choice or you can get 3 huge taco's for 5 dollars, the good thing about the taco's is you can mix and match them, that way you can taste 3 diffrent kinds. They also offer a vegitarian section like cactus, black beans and pinto beans, and it is all homeade. They have daily specials as well, the menu is changing and you can now get any kinda burger{bacon, guac,feta, jalopino ect} with fries for 6 BUCKS.. and then get a yummy flavored lemonade to go with your food the varieties are endless and they are only 3 bucks with a free refill as well, it is so good and kinda slushy, they make them while you wait! plus they pretty much have any kind of soda for a buck or sun tea I also heard a rumor they will be having breakfast as well soon, cannot wait!!\ so go check it out sit on the wrap around porch and enjoy your day!!!
