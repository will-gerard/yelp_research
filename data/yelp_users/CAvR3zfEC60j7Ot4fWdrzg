In the heart of downtown Chandler, this place is a great non-chain with local flair. There is a sushi conveyor belt & the picture menu that displays each roll makes ordering easy. Friendly staff with the owners on site, highly recommend! Interesting choice of techno music. Try the ASU roll, yum! Gave a 4 instead of a 5 because the non-specialty rolls are a bit on the small side.

Shady, shady, shady! I walked in with a cold and before I even had the chance to see a doctor or get a possible diagnosis, they tried to force a chest x-ray on me! Will be the last time I come here or refer anyone!
