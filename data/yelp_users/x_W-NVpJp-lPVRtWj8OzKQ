This place reminds me of a laid back day in Hawaii. Love the food and the friendly staff. So laid back and calm but super efficient and fast. Simple but great food.

I decided to try out this place since the place I go to regularly was booked solid that day and this one was next to the chiropractic office I go to. What a huge mistake. My lashes are clumpy and there is black glue all over my eyelid. Also the lashes started falling out the next day. I'm used to the lashes lasting at least two weeks not 2 days. The glue she used got so hard that every time I close my eyes I can feel the sharp edges of the glue irritating the line where the lashes go into the lid. What a colossal mistake. The other problem was when I went to pay they said they only take cash and the price was more then the coupon stated. She tried to say something about using only single lashes. Well duh! that's how every other place I've gone to does it. I've never had such horrible lashes not even the time I thought I'd try it myself. Ugh. I'm so frustrated. This place was such a waste of time and money. They weren't even nice people or had good customer service,  to take off the sting of their ineptitude. Boo Hiss!

Good food, great drinks. Wait staff somewhat attentive but needed to be called to attention a couple of times.

Great place to have a beer and some bar food. Occasionally has live music out back. Non pretentious hangout.

So sad to see another business go under. I went yesterday to get my car washed and after filling with gas and waiting for the attendant to start the wash I went to find out what the holdup was. I was then told the car wash was closed as they had been bought out by the bank. No signs anywhere to show car wash was closed. So sad.

This place always delivers. Great service, super fast and always with a smile. The prices are fair, the Pedi's always leave my feet feeling great and the eyelashes are the bomb.

I have been here many times and have always gotten a great massage. I have never had a bad experience. The receptionist has always been friendly and the wait times are shorter then expected. I've tried several if the therapists and have gone back to Eddie if he's available.

Too loud, too out of control, no staff around to offer any help. Screaming preteens running wild everywhere right next to adults drinking. Bad combination if this is supposed to be a family hangout.

I've been to several revolving sushi places in Hawaii. I love the concept of something original and different. The sushi was good. Not awesome but good and seemed to be relatively fresh. There is always the chance of not getting fresh sushi when its traveling around on the conveyor belt, just watch what they are putting out and pick wisely. If there is something different you like they will make it.  The prices are phenomenal. You pick the food you want and the prices line up with the color of the plate. How easy is that? So two people for dinner plus dessert was $13. That's total not each.

Horrible service with very poor food handling skills. The lady was too busy talking to get the order right and kept interrupting the customers during the order to talk to staff. No wonder all the orders were messed up. I should have known when the lady ahead of me had to shout to the guy "no mayo" for the third time my order would be a mess. His response and the managers was "well it comes with it". Apparently no individualization of orders is allowed.

Place has gone down the dumps. Smells so bad you have to hold your breath during workout. Hasn't been cleaned since last management. Old creepy guy hits on you while you workout
