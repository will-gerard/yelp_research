Really could go 3 1/2 but the fact that they are priced great and have chow fun in different variations has made me a fan.  Plus they deliver.

Food seemed okay, service okay, my wife likes the Indian movie selection - but can't recommend a restaurant with a known insect problem.

Enjoyed a late dinner.  Nice relaxed Tuesday evening meal.  Tried the Bastard cocktail, poke, and shrimp roll - enjoyed them all.  Good service.

Always enjoy myself here. Membership is worth it if you gonna few times or like to take friends.  Good spot for FFL transfers also.

Did not have a new advertised product okay.  But no glazed donuts??? Isn't that a staple.

Very knowledgeable and great selection. I'll drive from the west valley for the service alone.
