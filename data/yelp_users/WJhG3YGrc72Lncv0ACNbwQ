I love, love, love this place! It's so much nicer than Starbucks; the ambience is much better, the coffee tastes way better, and it's cheaper!   There is definitely a sense of community about The Coffee Rush, with local businesses leaving business cards by the door and photographs of regulars dotted all over the place. The owners are very friendly and know people by name.   Free Wi-Fi always gets my attention, but the beautiful views over the lake outside and the hoards of intellectuals with sunny dispositions, who seem to congregate here, and their way-too-interesting for words conversations, seems to keep it.   I tried the black cherry mocha rush frost, which I thought was just delectable. I will definitely be coming back for more in the very near future, since I think this could quite possibly be my beverage of choice for the foreseeable future.   What more could a girl ask for than free Wi-Fi, great company, scintillating conversations, and wonderful coffee. The Coffee Rush receives a huge thumbs up from me.

Dr. Johansen is WONDERFUL. I can't say enough great things about him.   He is awesome with children even though he is not specifically a pediatric dentist.   I used to dread going to see a dentist, but Dr. Johansen's chairside manner has helped me overcome the irrational fears I once had. He has a witty sense of humor and is very good at explaining everything.   I do wish that he as well as other dentists didn't quite charge as much as they do, but I'm not going to knock him too hard for that, since that could just be a market rate for his services.

I've eaten a lot of Asian food in my time, having traveled abroad extensively and having lived in California, but I don't think I have come across better Thai food. The green and red curries are delectable and can be made as mild or as spicy as your palate (and non-asbestos coated tongue) can handle. 1 is mild, 2 is considered medium, and 5 is Three-Mile Island hot (don't do this if you truly like yourself or even just marginally like yourself).   If you do decide to go, the evenings are not quite as busy as lunchtime. If you choose to try Swaddee during your lunch hour, then I highly suggest that you get there as soon as it opens for lunch, because Intel is right next door and many employees opt to eat at Swaddee.   Also, if you plan on bringing kids with you to the restaurant, then be careful which tables you sit at because some have piccies of scantily-clad (some nekked) ladies. I was forced to strategically place some condiments over one of the said scantily-clad ladies in a bit of a hurry just  recently.

If you are into dinner and a show then this is the place to go to for a great evening of food, wine, and entertainment., Teppanyaki cooking is also known as hibachi. In Japan, food preparation is an art form and teppanyaki is no exception. The chefs at the Honmachi toss their knives and the food in much the same way that Tom Cruise did glasses, cocktail shakers, and liquor bottles in the movie Cocktail, which has, since my visit to Honmachi, become less impressive. No offense, Tom, I hardly saw getting hit with a Lemon Drop as life-threatening, but what do I know.   Despite the seeming dangers, which include all the above as well as a bit of a show with fire, it is actually very safe and a lot of fun to boot. The food is awesome and is cooked to perfection. The sushi is delectable (try the ahi sashimi -- it's always been my benchmark for good sushi -- you won't regret it), the steak melts in your mouth, and the seared ahi is amazing.  In addition, try speaking a little Japanese when you're there. Don't be afraid of butchering it -- just think of the Styx song, leave off the Mr. Roboto part and you'll be in good shape. The staff all appreciate your trying to say thank you in their native language and will respond with a little Japanese themselves.   All-in-all, I really like this restaurant and rank it right up there among my favorites in the Chandler area. My advice is to make a reservation before you go, if you want to be seated at a table with a teppan (the grill). Have fun!

Ya know, I almost thought about giving Z-Tejas five stars just for having a separate, gluten-free menu, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it because the service was way below what I expect when I eat out.  We, a party of five (including my parents, who were visiting from Scotland), were initially seated at a really cramped table when several booths were open. Remedied this by asking to be moved to one of them. In addition, we didn't receive a kids' menu until we had waited around for about 20 mins. So, picture this, I have a hyper kid on my hands because his blood sugar levels are low and he's ready to chew his own arm off as well as those of everyone else surrouding him. Great... I will say that a very large party (around 20 people) was seated nearby and our server was one of many attending to their every need.  Our server had an excuse; he was new to the establishment and still in training. He was very cordial and was trying his best to deal with my gluten-free requirements. Turns out he wasn't given any training on the menu, with which he was very unfamiliar. Great...way to instill confidence that I'm not going to have a gluten-related "episode." Let me be clear, I don't blame him for this whatsoever. My hat goes off to him for trying. What got me was the dirty look I received from one of the female servers...WTF! What did I ever do to her. Message to her: You're in the wrong line of work, lady. Try collections or repossessions. I almost handed her back my gluten-free steak and vegs. My give up...  The food, when it did finally arrive, was good, albeit a little bland in my case. Why the heck people think gluten-free food has to taste bland is beyond me. I wish Gordon Ramsay would come in and rescue kitchens from their gluten-free nightmares. My parents both enjoyed their meals; they ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and green beans. My son enjoyed his cheeseburger, but then what kid doesn't? And, my husband enjoyed his seared ahi tuna steak, but felt the portion size was a little on the small side (he's a big guy).   Next time, I'll try the chambord margarita. I don't think I can go wrong with that -- at least it's alleged to taste good and it's gluten-free. =) I will, however, be checking out the restaurant in Tempe and not coming back to the one in Chandler.

A separate gluten-free menu always wins me over. What's more, the food (spicy chicken) was really delicious, which is somewhat unexpected for GF. The sauce was based on sweet and sour and was just the right amount of spicy.  More choices involving the use of GF soy sauce (it's out there) would have me eating there more often. The dishes on the GF menu are limited, but at least they have some, I guess, so I'm thankful; it's a start.

City Nails is owned by a lovely Vietnamese couple, who are very attentive to every one of their customers. I was pleasantly surprised that they both take the time to get to know each of their customer's names. Saturdays and Sundays are busy and I would advise prospective customers to make an appointment by calling the salon in advance. The salon is kept clean and has a pleasant atmosphere as well as friendly staff. Plenty of magazines usually lie around to keep customers entertained while they are relaxing and being pampered.  One thing to keep in mind, though, is that the owners prefer to be paid in cash or by check. This is because they are charged an exorbitant amount for each credit card transaction.  In regard to services provided, City Nails offers a full range, such as pink and white, full sets of acrylic nails, fills, backfills, manicures, pedicures, salt and sugar scrubs, etc. They even wax eyebrows and upper lips, among other things. For those customers with a bit of a wild streak, they offer a wide variety of nail tips (e.g., white, pearl, hot pink, purple, green, blue, etc.) as well as airbrushing. I just about always stick with the white or pearl tips due to my profession and haven't been disappointed yet. I love this place and all the people who work there! =)

Don't you just love cars ... that is, right up until something goes wrong with them. I feel exactly the same way. In fact, the feeling of sheer and utter dread overcomes me when I hear grinding noises coming from the front end of the car, despite my best attempts to keep up with rigorous maintenance schedules, oil changes, etc. Well, that was the case for me yesterday as I started to drive my car around sunny Chandler while running some errands. So, I zipped over to see the guys at Midas on Autoplex (take the Elliot exit on 10 and turn right at Autoplex -- Midas is on your right side, behind the car wash and gas station).   The guys were really friendly and helpful, taking my car right away to conduct an oil change and front-end check. They found the problem quickly and provided me with a reasonable estimate of the repair costs. I called around a few other places and found their price hard to beat. They completed the job within the hour and called me on my cell phone to confirm my car was ready for pickup. Great service! No hassles!  I really liked the facilities at this Midas. The place was quite parent-friendly, with a television for the kids, high-speed Internet and wi-fi on-site, as well as a vending machine with soft drinks, and water for those of us who prefer not to pay for our drinks wherever possible. ;-)

Yc's is so great that I frequently go there for lunch with my coworkers. I suggest getting there around 11 a.m. (or after 1 p.m.) to beat the lunch crowd because the line will often extend out of the door by noon. The atmosphere is lively during lunch and the lunch crowd is comprised of a diverse range of folks, from high schoolers, college kids, to professionals and the elderly. I wouldn't suggest going there for a power lunch business meeting because it can be hard to hear over the rabble at times.   The meat is frozen in thin strips, but I actually like that because it means I can cram more in the plate! Use the waxed paper that's placed off to the side to avoid touching the uncooked meats while you squish them down in your plate to get value for your money. Do the same with the vegs you add -- you're not going to care once your meal has been cooked and it's subsequently being consumed and digested! Stick to the recipes unless you feel comfortable experimenting with the sauces, etc., and can cope with, or enjoy, the results.   I've found that Mongolian BBQ works out well for kids. They all seem to enjoy being able to participate in making their own dinners. Definitely stick with one of the milder recipes, though, and go easy on the chili sauce or CPS may pay you a visit.  All in all, I've always had a very positive experience at the restaurant and rate it with four stars as a result.

The staff at family owned and run April's Hallmark are super friendly and very helpful. The store is always stocked with the latest Hallmark goodies. I love the post office that is contained within the store. Talk about a one-stop shop.

The Buffalo Exchange is awesome and I just love shopping there for cheap, designer denim and vintage Ts. If you are planning on updating your wardrobe and trading in your used clothing then make sure that it is seasonally-appropriate (no bikinis in December) and that it is fashionable. The latest Ann Taylor collections (or those that are a few seasons old) might look awesome to professionals, but they are usually shunned by the buyers at the Buffalo Exchange. Take them to My Sister's Closet, where they stand a chance of selling.

Famous Dave's serves up the best barbeque in town, without a doubt. The staff are friendly, the ribs are to die for, and the desserts (if you make it that far) are simply awesome. The feasts on the clean trashcan lid are good value if you have a large number of people in your party and offer you a sampling of some of the best items on the menu. If in doubt, though, try the St. Louis ribs. I've had them often and have never been disappointed.

It's a pity that there's no pub right next door to this place because they would have a rip-rawking business catching people as they stumbled out looking for something with which they could mop up the Coronas, while oblivious to the fact that Mexican food and Chinese had been combined. Yep, who knew that cheese on top of Chinese actually tasted pretty good.   "Yeah...," I hear you say, "you're Scottish and you eat those furry, wee beasties that roam around the mountains in that, there yonder place." Touche... But, you know what's in the food here and it actually is unique and tastes completely DELISH! :) What's more, they have a gluten-free menu! Yay!   Off the top of my head, the following items were GF: Jade Red Pork/Chicken Emerald Chicken Gringo Chicken Egg Foo Young (minus the pork and gravy) Pollo Diablo  Machaca Carnitas Rice Beans   I plumped for the Emerald chicken and Jade Red Chicken with black beans and rice. Soooo good. I don't mind the aluminum food bowls at all, but then I didn't come here with the mistaken impression that I was eating at Chez Froo Froo or having afternoon, high tea at The Ritz.  Anyway, I'll definitely be going back. Chino offers great value for money and the staff are uber-friendly! A big thumbs-up from me. I'll update with five stars when more nutritional info is given for items on the menu.

A carnosaurus rex's home from home. Could I be any clearer? From the post-modern retro American decor, with a slightly agricultural flavor, in this family-owned and family-friendly, gastronomic paradise to the scrummy nomnomnomalicious treats, Joe's Real BBQ has it all. This is undoubtedly one of my all-time favorite restaurants in the Valley.   I invariably survey the whole menu every time I go and I end up going with the ribs, which are always juicy (read a couple of reviews in which the reviewer said that the ribs were dry; I dunno, I think you went on the one day of the year they are dry) and coated with a BBQ sauce that is to die for. I've never gone wrong with the potato salad, coleslaw, or corn, but I hear the BBQ pit beans are great too. I'm not a root beer fan, but my son swears it's awesome and he's usually pretty forthcoming about things that don't sit well with him, so I've got to believe the root beer doesn't suck too badly. The pulled pork and the chicken rawk the sawks, so check them out if you get a chance.   Also love the take-out window outside. If you don't feel like standing in line inside (and there's always a line around lunchtime and dinner), then get your quick fix with some take-out instead.   All of the menus can be found at Joe's Web site: http://www.joesrealbbq.com/menu.php  The prices are on a par with Famous Dave's, but I think the food is much better, so Joe's offers better value and a real down-to-Earth, all-American family atmosphere.

Natalie W is completely on the money, but not out of it. My Sister's Closet is a great place to obtain designer togs at an awesome price. I just purchased a Coach handbag (not a knockoff) in great condition for under $40. Other than eBay, I can't think of where else I could possibly do that. This store, in particular, is well-organized and more open than the other locations, making items easier to find.

I entered Shabu Fondue this evening anticipating a fun and filling meal. While fondue is always fun, I found this particular meal was lacking in the filling department. My husband and I ordered the cheese course for two (swiss and emmenthal cheeses with white wine and lemon), which was really delicious with apple slices and bread chunks. We followed up with steak and chicken (served with a selection of vegs and a hot, seasoned chicken broth). In retrospect, we should have given this course a miss and ordered more of the cheese!   The cheese course cost us $13.00 for two (portion size was very small), while the ribeye cost $15.95 and the chicken $14.95 (all prices exclusive of taxes). We both definitely felt that we would have been better off eating at The Melting Pot because, while it is more expensive, it offers better value -- bigger portions, a larger selection of meats and seafood, more choices in regards to cooking methods (oils and different kinds of broths), and fixed price menus for groups with 2+ people.   The atmosphere at Shabu was also lacking. A restaurant's quality can often be measured by how many covers it has in an evening. On the day after Christmas Day a restaurant should be buzzing. Shabu was nearly empty.  I will say that our server was quite excellent, though. She was attentive and a great conversationalist. If the food we had consumed had been to the same standard, I would definitely have rated this restaurant with 5 stars.

I LOVE this place and with good reason: Picazzo's has a separate gluten-free menu (which can be found online) for celiac sufferers, as well as those who are more sensitive or allergic to the effects of wheat. Kitchen utensils and ovens are reserved for the preparation and cooking of gluten-free doughs and other goodies. This helps prevent contamination, which can wreak havoc on one later. For the most part, the GF menu is exactly the same as the regular menu and this is a wonderful thing. A GF diet can be VERY restrictive, but Picazzo's has really gone out of its way to accommodate those of us, who cannot tolerate gluten and has won several awards for having done so. How many restaurants can truly say that?  Neither the dough nor the toppings are bland. The salads all taste delicious. The servers are always quick and very courteous, and they take the time to get to know you by name when you are a regular. The prices are a little excessive, but I think the quality and freshness of the food is outstanding and that this is well worth paying a little extra to obtain. It's definitely a value call for all of us, but the peace of mind and shear delight afforded me by this restaurant's having a separate GF menu and cooking facilities makes this a top choice for me!

I think I am in love with Sprouts! No, seriously. It's a little crunchy (lots of mountain biking, spandex-wearing, tree-hugging-like people), but these guys do have one of the best selections of fresh, organic fruits and vegs around (maybe with the exception of Whole Foods) at a reasonable price.   That's not what I like most about this place, though. I LOVE their free guide to gluten- and wheat-free eating that's placed throughout the store. The booklet contains a no-nonsense list of foods and brands that do not contain gluten that are sold within the store.   The staff members are very knowledgable and can explain which supplements are best for people who are sensitive to gluten. It's not until you try to eliminate this substance from your diet that you truly gain an understanding of how much crap actually contains it. It's EVERYWHERE!   Anyway, this store chain is so much cheaper than the majority of mainstream grocers, e.g., Fry's, Albertsons. Their bulk product sections are really phenomenal and offer customers a great deal of variety to choose from at an even better price.   Love it, love it, love it!!!!

Whole Foods is wonderful, albeit a little expensive. If you live nearby, my advice; if you are hankering for some of their delicious, hot food; is to buy it there, but take it home. My reasoning is that the store will tax you for eating on the premises and will add this tax to your bill. Granted, they are pretty clear about this at the checkout and will ask you if you plan on eating the food in the store. Alternatively, pay the tax and enjoy some of the tapas at the in-store wine and tapas bar (go easy on or abstain from the wine if you are driving of course). The atmosphere is pretty decent and the food is even better.  Parents will find a great selection of organic and gluten-free products for both themselves and their kids.

Hailing from Scotland and having lived for a while in England, I occasionally develop a hankering for some good, English pub grub. I stumbled (no, I wasn't drunk despite the stereotypes that exist about the Scots) across a flyer for Churchill's during a visit to The British Shop on Thomas and Hayden (SW corner) and thought I'd pay it a visit one night with my family and satisfy those cravings I'd been having.  Overcoming the fact that this pub was in a strip mall (unusual as anyone from Britain will tell you), I stepped in and was immediately greeted by a very friendly co-owner with an authentic, English accent. "Boy, they weren't kidding when they described this place as quintessentially British, were they?" I thought to myself. True to form, premier league (English) soccer (or football as we Brits tend to describe it) was playing on every television set. A dart board lay off to the side and a pool table occupied the space adjacent to the bar. I also noticed some posters, which were advertising the pub/restaurant's quiz and karaoke nights -- both hallmarks of a decent establishment back in the old country believe it or not. The next test for me was the menu.  I wasn't going to be disappointed. All the classic, British pub favorites were on the menu, e.g., bangers (sausages) and mash (mashed potatoes), bubble and squeak (tasty concoction of potatoes, cabbage, and leeks), shepherd's pie, and of course, fish and chips (fries -- you'd be surprised how many people screw that up). I chose the fish and chips and thoroughly enjoyed my meal with a little malt vinegar and just a dash of salt and pepper. The organic apple cider (alcoholic -- we don't have non-alcoholic cider back in Britain -- we call that apple juice)  was quite excellent. My husband (the designated driver that evening) drank the coffee, which he swears was better than that sold at Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. He paired this with the prime rib, which he claimed was perfectly cooked in between mouthfuls.   At one point during our meal, the owners came around and asked how everything tasted. Why is it everyone has a knack of asking you that question  when you're in the middle of chewing? Anyway, after hastily swallowing our food, we duly informed him that we would be returning for a little taste of home. I was very impressed by the overall quality of the food (yes, quality is a word that can be associated with British food), as well as the friendliness of the staff and owners.   This is a great place to meet up with friends (even with kids -- they love the pool table) and enjoy a relaxed meal and a couple drinks and I'll definitely be doing that on occasion with my friends. Five stars!

From the minute you step in the door, it's pretty obvious that this is a chain. The nice thing about pubs in Ireland (lived over in the UK until I was 21, so I've been to a pub or seven) is that they may be owned by one or two brewery's, but they each have their own feel, menu, and clientele. Also, I've never seen a pub in Ireland with the servers wearing Scottish kilts; come to think of it, I've never seen one with the servers wearing Irish kilts either. The place lacked the craic (not a drug, the other kind--fun, enjoyment, abandonment, or lighthearted mischief; often in the context of drinking or music).   What I really want to know is what the heck nachos were doing on the menu in a so-called Irish pub. Just because potato wedges were substituted for tortilla chips doesn't mean the dish is now Irish. Oh, and what was up with the Cheese Whizz crap they put on top of them. On the bright side, the boxty wasn't bad--basically stewed beef (cooked with Guinness) in a potato pancake.   Suggestion:  a live, Irish band might make all the difference to D'Arcy McGee's, but I'm not in charge of marketing. In the mean time, if you want a place with a somewhat more traditional Irish pub's atmosphere, go to Rula Bula on Mill Avenue.

This is my home from home when I'm working on projects or need to escape the cube farm. Gangplank is a great resource for local techies and creative types. I love the open, collaborative environment and the fact that they actually thought about what people and companies need when they are trying to be productive and get things done.   First: It may seem trivial, but the plain, large IKEA tables with power outlets cable-tied to the legs are a real boon! The first thing I do when about to work on my Mac is look for the juice.  Next: The podcast studio is a real asset. They modestly claim that it's not as good as they'd like, but stick your head in the door and you'll be blown away.  Next-to-Last: Everyone there is fun and welcoming. There's no such thing as a dumb question. Someone is always on hand to chat or bounce around ideas or joke with.  Lastly: What's not to like about a place with a pool table, a dart board, and a comfy couch?   Hacknights are the place to be on a Wednesday evening if you have a project to work on or you feel like hanging out with some mighty cool peeps and tweeps. :)

Buying tickets for movies at Harkins Theatres at Chandler Fashion Center is easy, with many options available to movie-goers. Tickets can be purchased at the box-office, electronically inside the cinema itself, or online through Yahoo! or HarkinsTheatres.com. I'd like to see more options for purchasing the tickets from my phone, but I guess I'll have to wait for technology to catch up with my wish list for now.   Loyalty t-shirts and cups are a great idea for regulars. T-shirts ($20 for standard fit and $25 for the ladies' fit) allow for a free 85oz popcorn in 2008, while loyalty cups ($4.25 ea) allow bearers to obtain $1 refills of soda in 2008.  A few visits to the cinema and you'll break even. The key is to visit enough to come out ahead, at least in regards to your food purchases (assuming these are the only items you buy). Note carefully: you will need to allow yourself some time to arrive at the movie theater, show your t-shirts to those at the customer service desk inside the theater and obtain a piece of paper that entitles you to your popcorn. Talk about inefficient! This is my one complaint about the loyalty system.  My recommendation is to purchase your movie tickets at Costco (if you tend not to attend matinees), since this will allow you to save a little money. Another idea is to negotiate group rates for your company and offer the tickets to your employees at the group rate per ticket.   Parking can also be an issue at the Chandler Fashion Mall (if you're looking for a space close to the theater). My suggestion is to park close to Macy's and walk through the mall or cross over by Gardunos (depending on which side of Macy's you choose to park or are able to park for that matter). Valet parking, although an option, just adds to the cost of your entertainment, and although it may help you feel special, is a waste of money (about the cost of another movie ticket!).
