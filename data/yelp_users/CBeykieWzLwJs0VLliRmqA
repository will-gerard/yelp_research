This is easily the most disorganized, dirty Zoe's I've ever been in. All of the employees seems sweaty and unkempt. The restaurant is always dirty, tables not wiped down and it isn't uncommon to see flies all over the place.  In terms of the food, the salmon kabobs are ok but the white beans are usually runny. Every time I've gotten white beans, I had to ask it it were beans or soup.  I like the Zoes franchise and have been to locations all across the country and have never seen a location like this. Take into account the parking is absolutely horrendous and the trip to this Zoes simply isn't worth it.

Not sure where to begin but I'll give my experiences. I took my car in and I was given quotes that were flat out lies. The first quote I asked for, after my car was checked, the person at the service desk flat out refused to give me a print out, like reputable dealers do. He wrote it out on a blank piece of paper and refused to be specific on exactly they found as possible issues and what they feel I needed. Never in my life have I experienced a dealership being evasive on what they looked at, what they found and what they feel you need.  Since it was a dealership I gave them the benefit of the doubt (big mistake). After my car was fixed the quote that was written on the paper was nowhere near what I was being charged. When I said "I asked for the exact quote including tax and you said this was it, what happened?" all I got was "I made a mistake".   The second time I brought my car in the same quote thing happened but this time, I did receive an actual print out with a quote. When I asked "will this be the exact price?" I was told "I think so". The same thing happened as before in terms of the quote but this time my radio was not working after the work was done on my car.  When I get home to tell them my radio was not working I was told to bring it back and they will look at it. When I arrived I was told "how do we know the radio wasn't working when you brought it in?". I told the service advisor "well your guy turned the radio down when he got in my car because we BOTH heard it on when he turned on the car so obviously it was working".  I was then told "well maybe you have a short or something but we don't know if it was working when you brought it in". After us going back and forth on whether my radio wasn't working or not when I brought it in, the advisor then said they would check it and see if I had a shortness the radio.  They took me to the back and as they were testing my radio they commented "umm you don't have a short, but maybe it's a bad radio". When I told the tech "no, my radio is fine" I could see the anger in his eyes because I was holding them accountable for not doing proper work on my vehicle. Right then I knew they were liars and flat out dishonest. It's my fault for assuming the dealerships would be on the "up and up".  After going back and forth with management on this, I was done trying to work with them. I hits decided to never go to them again.  Go here if you want but understand they are liars and if anything goes wrong they are going to put the responsibility on the customer. If your radio, windshield wipers or anything else is not working properly after they repair your car and you can't prove that it was working properly before you brought it in, be prepared to spend money to get their mistakes fixed.....because you can't prove that it wasn't working when you brought it in.

I was in the mood for pancakes so I decided to stop in. This is a bagel shop but the great thing is you can get a full breakfast.   I ordered the pancakes and potatoes (see pictures). The pancakes were really good. They taste like a higher quality McDonald's pancakes. The potatoes were fresh and hot and the did not skimp on the portions.   You can purchase a single pancake if you'd like, so keep in mind they are huge. Make sure you ask for an extra syrup as well.  All and all this is a nice place for breakfast and I'll certainly go back.

If you want quality meats, veggies and fruits AJ's is the place for you.   The bottom line is you get what you pay for here. Everything is great.

I was told this place was good and decided to give it a shot. The blonde woman who took my order at the take out register was very icy and treated me as if they were paying me to eat there.  After telling her "no onions" on my gyro and her repeating "ok, no onions" I get my food 10 minutes later and yep, onions all over it. I reminded her that said no onions on the gyro and she proceeds to look me I'm the face and say "I didn't hear you say no onions".  She then asks the cooks to make another gyro because, and I quote, "he now says he doesn't want onions on it".  Once I received my food the gyro was soggy, as if the pita was wet. The veggies were average.  I believe in supporting local businesses but I'm never going back. The service was bad and the food was average. I can deal with average food if the experience was pleasant and the environment was welcoming, but that wasn't the case today.  Save yourself the hassle and skip this place. You'll be treated with contempt and receive subpar food.....late.

I recently discovered Haji-Baba and have really fallen in like with it. It's a grocery store as well that sells hard to find Mediterranean spices, juices and other foods.  The restaurant section is pretty small and the decor is a bit old but the food is really good and quick. It's never too spicy and is always hot and fresh. My favorite is the chicken shawarma. The only draw back is everytime I've order a Sprite, I get water. I'm not sure if the waiters aren't paying attention or what but it happens all the time.  That being said for something different I highly recommend Haji-Baba. The portions are rather large so if you're dieting I'd suggest splitting the meal with someone or going there for a cheat day!

I wish I had come to Yelp before going here. The service was the worst I've had in at least 10 years. The bartender was too busy talking to either her co-workers or some guy she knew to be bothered with basic things like asking me and the guy sitting next to her if we needed anything else, if we needed to pay or if we wanted anything.  I ordered the sliders (which only came with cheese and meat by the way) and had the person that brought it out pretty much drop it in front of me and walk away. At 99% of establishments they ask "do you need anything else?" but I guess service isn't a priority here. Usually ketchup and mustard are at least brought out, but not here. I had to ask for everything from napkins to a menu.  The bartender was either story telling or just talking because all I could see is me waving trying to get her attention for about 5 minutes and all I heard was her dropping f-bombs when talking to this guy who I assume was a regular.  I left a little note on basic customer service but I'm sure it'll go ignored. My first impression of this place is really as low as it gets. Bad service, average food and a wasted night.  I truly believe in supporting local business but this was dreadful. I would advise anyone to avoid this place at all costs. Very, very unimpressed with everything about it.  You've been warned.

Very, very, very good burger. The burger wasn't "heavy" on the stomach at all. The sweet potato fries were good but the chocolate shake was only average though.  It was super crowed but my food only took about 5 or 6 minutes. The ambience has a throwback 50's feel to it.  If I'm in downtown Phoenix I'll certainly look these guys up. It has the taste of a burger that's made by your uncle that's the best grill master in the family!

Great pizza! I went to pick up a large pepperoni and was surprised at own big the slices were. You can tell they use quality ingredients. The pizza was hot, fresh, and the cheese melts in your mouth. I ordered a Pepsi while waiting and even the glass was big. The atmosphere seemed really nice and you can eat on the patio where the small pond is.  I reheated a piece in the oven the day after my visit and it was just as good as it was when I got it fresh, that says a lot.   If you're willing to pay for the quality (I paid $23.00 including the Pepsi) with so many other pizza restaurants charging $10.00 for a pizza then it's well worth it.

When you go to Mrs. White's you will get down home food. You will also get down home service, which means prepare to be ignored while the staff talks and laugh among themselves.  The food was good but the only problem is if you go two hours before closing time they will be out of most (if not all) of the side dishes and desserts, which is very odd. You rarely find it crowded (except maybe on Sundays after church) so it seems as if they would rather have less sides or just enough than too much. I can't imagine a restaurant constantly "running out of food" all the time.  It took us about 45 minutes to get our food and only after the waitress told us every 15 minutes they had no more mac and cheese, then no more sweet potatoes, then no more greens.   The chicken was very good and so was the cornbread, but I've been here several times and the service is the same.  As we were looking to pay our bill the owner (or someone related to Mrs. White I assume) was on the phone talking to someone about going out that night, over charged us, swore we owed more than we did (all the while he's still having a conversation on the phone) and when we finally told him he over charged us he just said "oh".  The food isn't enough to make up for the service and vanishing dessert and sides options, so I think I won't be going back.

Great place!I'm 6'0, 215lbs and the plate that I got was too much for me to finish and I was starving.  The waitress was very nice as well. No matter what you order to drink it'll come in a Mason jar.  The food was great and the chicken was not greasy at all. The cool thing is they leave you alone enough to eat and enjoy your food without ignoring you, great balance in customer service.  The only bad thing is I have to drive all the way to Scottsdale from my home in Chandler!

Best. most professional shop in Phoenix. I've tried several shops in Phoenix and this is by far my favorite.  LeVar always is prompt, professional and makes sure you're in and out.

Very knowledgeable, patient and personable doctor. The doctor answered all of my questions, along with offering suggestions on other products I should use to get optimum results.   Very professional office with a great decor.

I had an issue with the service but Cassie made it right. Most business owners make very little effort to make things right, but Cassie went above and beyond.  That says a lot.

Very good mom and pop restaurant with nice atmosphere.This is not a place where you go for a healthy breakfast or the atmosphere, unless you're 70.   I ordered the biscuit plate which included biscuits and gravy, eggs, meat and grits. Like a lot of places I've noticed recently the portions are huge, so unless you have giant sized appetite I'd advise sharing the meal.  My food was warm and had a homemade taste to it. My waitress was less than friendly, but I chalk that up to maybe she was having a bad day.  When we finished eating the owner (I think) came by and asked if everything was ok because he saw I only ate half of everything but I assured him the food was good but the portions were just so large.  If you want a homemade breakfast this is the place for you. My breakfast for two was about  $30.00.

The BEST BREAKFAST restaurant in Phoenix. The pancakes and the grits are second to none. When people ask where they should go to breakfast this is the first place I tell them.  The service is always pretty good and I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes to be seated.

Wow! All I can say if wow. I had this for the first time on Friday and it was the best soul food I've ever had.  The chicken was amazing, the sweet potatos were great, the mac and cheese was perfect and the red velvet cake was the best I've had.  The only complaint I have is it's too close to my home in Phoenix. That's like putting a crack addict next to a crack house!   All kidding aside, the portions were huge so remember that one meal could actually feed two adults. You won't be sorry.

I don't know where to begin. The service is horrible. I ordered a meal for dine-in and was treated like I offended them by my mere presence. The person that was bringing the food to guess didn't think I needed napkins or utensils. Strangely enough, she did feel compelled to bring everyone else before and after me theirs though, which I was odd. She even managed to be friendly to others while I she refused to even acknowledge me, until she dropped my bowl on the table and hurried away.  In terms of the actual food, the sushi was made with rice that tasted like it had been cooked, reheated, cooked, reheated and cooked again.  I wanted to give this place a chance but after my last three visitis, I'm done.
