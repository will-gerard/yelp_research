Look, I had a gift card for $10 and no reason to go to The Melting Pot. So already this wasn't going to be the best experience ever.  The two stars I'm giving were for the first time I called to see if they would just do a ceaser salad w/chicken to go. I called around 2, not knowing this was a dinner only restaurant, but the lady I spoke to said she could prepare the salad for me, just not the chicken because the cooks weren't even in yet. She was very nice and I appreciated her willingness to accommodate me HOURS before they even open. But I decided to skip it, not wantging her to go to the trouble when they were closed. On her own, this lady was 4-5 stars,  and I wished I would've just had her make the salad.   Ok. Skip ahead a week. Now I'm sick and call about 8 at night to see if I can pick up the salad on my way home from work. I'm told they don't do to go orders. I tell the girl I spoke with someone last week and she said no problem, so this girl puts me on hold to speak w/ a manager. She comes back and says yes to the salad, no to the chicken because they have no way to cook it. So, within 1 week, a restaurant has lost the ability to cook a chicken breast. Really? .... so I ask for a cup of hot tea, since I'm sick. She says "I promise you, there is no way I can give a to go drink". Oh, but I can take a teabag if I really need it.  I tell her to forget the whole thing. Way too difficult of a conversation, especially when 1)I'm ill and 2) a week earlier it was no problem. So now I have a giftcard, no salad, and a bad taste in my mouth from the experience

What can I say, it was as good as everyone says it is!  I went on Sunday, trekked across the desert sands to beautiful old town Gilbert (never been!) And walked intothe most stinkin cute joint I've been to in awhile! Anyplace that has 25cent coffee and CANDY BUTTONS is going to earn high marks from me.  So why no 5 stars? Its minor stuff, and Joes is more of a 4 1/2 star place in my book. I ordered the chopped brisket sandwhich, after asking the girl in the paper hat if she preferred that or the pulled pork. It was amazing, though I was surprised to find I needed extra bbq sauce, since its cooked in the stuff. No matter, the sauce is free and delicious. Also ordered bbq beans- amazing- and mac & cheese -lost me a bit here. I wanted to love it, but felt it could use something extra and not just be standard mac & cheese. The crumbs were nice, but overall, this was just ok for me. Got a homemade rootbeer to wash it down- great touch. Next time, I'm going for the red cream! To finish (dear God, this was a lot of food lol) I had the apple crisp. Frowny face. Seriously, I  was disappointed. For one, I much prefer red apples in a crisp, green tart apples seem wrong to me. Also, my crisp was missing its namesake and was more like slightly chewy.   Total: $14.11... but did I mention the BOGO coupon for a weekend breakfast they threw in? I'm a sucker for savings!

I am insanely in love with this little gem of a restaurant. I, like many others, first went to Fuego Bistro after the happy hour Groupon was released awhile ago. After checking the restaurants website, I was intrigued enough to get a Groupon, but hardly prepared for what I got. So here's what I've had, in order of least fave to OMG-I-get-it-everytime: (Because I've only been during happy hour, none of this is the dinner menu stuff. So excited to order those in the future, though!) 1) chicken tacos- while probably better than most placeschicken tacos, this was sampled off someone elses plate after I had already had something better. So while good, not the best I've had here. 2) Horchata bread pudding- it almost pains me to put this so far down, but again, the other items were just that good. Presentation on this dessert is a ten. Size- wow big. I had to bring most of it home. Flavor was where it lost me a little. I'm big fan of horchata and was just expecting a stronger cinnamon flavor, not to mention I'm pretty sure there is no rice in this dessert.  The bread pudding was good, especially with the slightly melted chocolate chips and candied walnuts on top, but nothing resembling horchata. On a positive note, it was served with the most amazing cookies and cream ice cream I've ever tried. Id have been happier just getting a large scoop of that (next time!) 3) tilapia tacos- ahhh... spicy but tolerable, perfectly cooked, great blend of flavors. The fact that everytime I order these the tortilla falls apart and I end up eating it with a fork does nothing to dissway me from them. Terrific! 4) pernil quesadilla- and here is the reason I'm hooked. The most tender and flavorful pork inside a perfectly chewy/crispy tortilla, with gooey happiness inside. I'm in love. The last time I went, knowing how good these were, I ordered one to eat and one to go at the start of my meal. Try it. Love it. And then there's the place itself. Yeah, hard to find, but worth it. And have I mentioned that I live in Surprise? Completely worth the trip. Service is exceptional, ambiance is exactly what this place should be like. Can't wait to go on a weekend night for the live music. Def. my fave Phoenix restaurant!

I received a ton of gift cards to tgifridays... unfortunately, this is the location closest to me. The food @ this one has been mediocre and frequently incorrect. Even wrote in to their corporate office once and received a voucher for $8- pretty sad state if I don't even want to use it.  Other locations have not inspired this feeling in me. Its like this one just doesn't care.

Typed haircut and a zip by my work into Yelp, and this place popped up. I don't go to highend salons due to cost, but certainly want a great look! Thought I may be able to find a gem here.  Jessica was the student who worked on me. First thing was her teacher came over to discuss what treatments I wanted (relaxer, scalp treatment, haircut and brow wax). She determined I couldn't do the relaxer because I had self-dyed my hair a few months back (damn!). Ill have to wait until it grows out. So she looked @ my hair and asked what I wanted. Moisture, I want moisture! So instead of the relaxer and scalp treatment, we started with a shampoo followed by a yummy smelling deep conditioning treatment. While that sank in, Jessica waxed my brows- slow getting started but minimally painful. She did a good job. Next was thehaircut. All I said was 'no bangs, I have to wear my hair up at work, and get rid of the split ends'. Is it the greatest haircut I've ever seen? No. But its cute, super soft now, and I like the job she did with a flatiron. Worth the $25.50 + tip? Hell yes. I'm going to schedule an appointment to get some color done and a facial next week.  Try this place out, the deals you can get w/ the quality stuff they use makes it completely worth it

I actually said 'oh wow!' after I sampled the Oatmeal. Yes, its amazing. I love the toppings they offered, both in selection and size. How nice to an entire baklava stick, mallow creme, almond roca... great stuff here.  Ok the slightly bad- Price is higher than places like yogurtland. I spent about 40% more than I normally would, but to be fair, I got things like the baklava and brownie, 2 sauces, heavier stuff. But no more in quantity. They charge 40cents/oz Also, my tongue itched for about 15 minutes after starting to eat. This only happens to me when I have underripe bananas or kiwis, and I didn't have any fruit. Mildly irritating to me at worst, but possibly they are using the same knives the cut fruit then the brownies without washing the knife? Could be an issue if someone is allergic. Yogurtology staff, if reading this, check into that!

Seriously, Joann... raise your prices.  Not often I would say that, but the very last thing I would want to see from this family business is for it to fail because of low margins. You get so much for such a low price here, its really ridiculous. And I know Joann (the chef/owner) reads these reviews, so having told her this last night I wanted to repeat it on Yelp as well, because this is the kind of dining experience most people will probably never come across, but is amazing. Im now sitting here wishing other restaurants were ran this way, because it would make people like me (I want to try everything!) SO HAPPY.  Im the date in Rons review, so you can read that for most of the details. Just know I have never liked Pad Thai anywhere before, and when we finished off the large plate of it and Joann asked if we wanted anymore, I think my heart stopped for a sec in pleasure. And the dessert? Oh my god... oh my god. I could eat that every night  Couple of warnings though-  the papaya salad is spicy. Unassuming too, so be careful. The 'green bean' in the curry is NOT a green bean. It is a very spicy little chili, and apparantly it was quite funny to watch me discover this information Seriously. Speak slowly and clearly when saying 'peanut sauce' or you will have two 30 yr old men giggling like little school girls.   Go, support Joann, and take a peak at her old photos on one of the tables in the middle of the restaurant. Shes smoking hot.

Oh my goodness, I have forgotten to review Rocket Burger?! I'm such a bad customer, because I love this place and feel everyone should try them out. I've had:  California Club The New Yorker -yum! BBQ pulled pork- even good straight out of the fridge next day with no warm up! Regular burger Some special burger they did on Memorial Day with the Rocket Relish- so good and spicy! Fries Cheese curds- never had these before, and I really like them now Chili cheese fries Brownie  So anyhow... I've been there a time or 6. Good food, great prices, friendly service. Definite go-to spot when I'm around the area

Oh dear goodness, the fact that Yogurtology has become something of an obsession of mine over the past couple of months + finding this location ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK= very bad news for my wallet. On the other hand, I will now be in heaven without having to drive 30 mins out of the way.  There is peace and happiness in my life.  (Read my other review of the camelback location, but its 5 stars now)
