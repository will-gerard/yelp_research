My car wouldn't start, wouldn't take a jump, so I called AAA. They said it was the battery, and replaced my battery. If the exchange would've ended here, I would give this place 5 stars. The guy who replaced my battery was really nice--he just didn't know what he was doing and fixed the wrong thing. Because come to find 2 days later, it is not the battery. So, I take it to one of their shops.   Shop says I need a brake light sensor and brake light sensor harness replaced. I called the Nissan dealership and they said all I needed was the sensor, not the harness, and that it would save about $300 bucks to just replace the sensor.   Then I am told by a AAA member relations person I can get a refund on the battery and apply that credit toward the shop fees. Even though the Nissan dealership down the street is still $30 cheaper (including the credit), I decide to just get it fixed at the AAA shop. When it comes time to pay, nobody has any idea about the credit, says they never heard of it--no one at the shop, at corporate, at member relations, or the battery replacement department can help me.    I spoke to 13 different people who are employed by AAA of Arizona. I spoke to four different 'arms' 'departments' whatever the f you want to call them. I got nothing. Actually, I got my claim passed along five different times. It landed in the hands of a lovely (read: not at all lovely and totally sucky and awful) lady named Martha.   I hoped Martha would be my light at the end of the dark and festering AAA tunnel but alas, she was not. Instead she passed my claim along to AAA of California (where I am originally from and where the membership was purchased). Wow thank you Martha. For passing my claim along to someone I've never spoken to in a state I no longer live in. I would have rather you lit my claim on fire in front of me.  Anyway, I can't express enough how much I hate this place. On the bright side, my car is running (better be, for the amount I paid). I just wish Martha would have the courtesy to get in the driver's seat while I lay in the road and run me over with it. That would honestly be so much better than ever having to deal with AAA of Arizona ever again.

I get a mani/pedi maybeeee 4-6 times a year. I am pretty good at painting my own nails, so unless I'm feeling supremely lazy or in dire need of pampering, I do them myself.  Last Friday evening I was in a rush to get my nails done before a dinner (so of the two aforementioned moods--I was being supremely lazy). Charlie's Nails is 2 blocks from where I live, so out of haste, I chose to go here. I will never go back.  The customer service here is appalling. They request cash tips, and when I mentioned I didn't have cash and asked if I could tip using my card, the nail tech kindly suggested that I walk across the parking lot in my pedicure flip-flops to the ATM at Wells Fargo to withdraw some cash for tip. I asked if she was being serious. She replied with, "It would be easier for me if you tipped in cash."  OH! Well then let me shuffle across the parking lot in the dark in these 1mm thick foam flip flops and get you some cash! I hate myself for tipping her, but I know what it is like to work for tips and I am just not that person who tries to teach service workers a lesson by leaving no tip.  However I am that person who will write a bad Yelp review about it. So here it is. Also, as if it even needs to be mentioned--the manicure was total shit (air bubbles in the polish, a peeling top coat). But it was the service that did this place in for me.

Churn is my go-to ice cream shop in the Phoenix area. I think it has been well over a year since I've gone to ice cream anywhere else.  First, without even bringing up how good the actual product is--the ambiance is top notch. It's a tiny shop, but it's attached to Windsor and has a nice little patio in the back (nice meaning not-at-all-nice in the months of June, July, August, or September..and most of October (P.S. For all the Phoenicians who say the unbearable heat 'only lasts 3 months'--you are full of sh*t. It hits 100 in May, and I've seen triple digits all the way in to November).  ANYWAY, back to the ice cream. My favorite flavors are the Butter Pecan (sweet and salty gets me every time), Toasted Coconut, and Peanut Butter & Jelly, when they have it. I normally just go with a scoop in a cup, because the ice cream is that good that I think it is better off standing alone. However, if you want to get fancy, I'd recommend an ice cream cookie sandwich. You can mix and match cookies, and it makes for the perfect share-able dessert. The people who work there are awesome too. You know how some people get super annoyed when you ask for tons of samples? At Churn, they don't. In fact, in addition to ice cream samples, they give you brownie and cookie samples as well.  If you aren't an ice cream kinda person (who isn't though?), there are a ton of candies and fun toys in the shop as well. But really, when ice cream is on the table, there's really no other option.

Yes, Clark is a nice guy. I would not say he is a jerk, by any means. He is a totally cool guy who I would probably be friends with if I didn't hate AAA of Arizona so much and if I didn't just waste hours battling their various departments.  Anyway--my car wouldn't start, wouldn't take a jump, so I called AAA Roadside Assistance. They said it was the battery, and replaced my battery. Come to find 2 days later, it is not the battery. So, I take it to this very shop.  Clark says I need a brake light sensor and brake light sensor harness replaced. I called the Nissan dealership and they said all I needed was the sensor, not the harness, and that it would save about $300 bucks to just replace the sensor. Strike one.  Then I am told by a AAA member relations person I can get a refund on the battery and apply that credit toward the shop fees. Even though the Nissan dealership down the street is still $30 cheaper (including the credit), I decide to just get it fixed at this shop. When it comes time to pay, the credit is no longer valid, no one at the shop, at corporate, at member relations, or the battery replacement can help me.  Strike two.  I spoke to 13 different people who are employed by AAA of Arizona. Got nothing. Ended up paying for both repairs, no credit, nada. Actually, the corporate lady, Martha, who I spoke to was 'nice' enough to pass my complaint along to AAA of California (where I am originally from and where the membership was purchased). Wow thank you. For nothing. Strike three. Hence, why I hate this place.

The bowls are really good, and one of few places in our neighborhood you can find an acai bowl within walking distance.  However the service is extremely slow, and the people who work there seem to really not care about their jobs. Several times I've walked into the store with no one at the register. Instead, the employees are in the back, sitting on the counters and chatting. It normally doesn't bother me too much as I know they are young and the store can get slow at times.  Today my husband and I walked in and ordered an acai bowl, walked next door to grab a coffee, and returned to the store to get our bowls. When we returned, rather than going to the register we sat at a table and waited. After 5 minutes, the bowls weren't ready, and no employees had come out from the back to acknowledge us. My husband got up, went to the counter and found all 3 employees sitting on the counters in the back, chatting and eating acai bowls.  It turns out our bowls were made and taken by other customers. Fine, totally not the employees' fault, but the lack of alertness and sense of urgency in this store is appalling. A customer should not walk into a store and wait 5 minutes to be acknowledged.
