I think a more appropriate name for this restaurant should be "The Disappointing Egg", as I was very disappointed in my meal. I got a veggie omelet that was supposed to include broccoli among other vegetables. The "broccoli" in my omelet was literally a pinch of broccoli scraps that you might find at the bottom of the bag. It was mostly onion, which is a pretty big cop-op for an overpriced omelet. Granted, this was my first time here, so bear that in mind w/me review, this experience has lead me to not want to come back. I found it to be a waste of time, money, and calories.

What a great place to shop for a special kid in your life! This locally owned shop features a huge variety of awesome fun toys, crafts, educational toys, etc. for kids of a variety of ages. The prices are very reasonable and you can find some more unique items than you would at a big chain. I love it, and they gift wrap for free and make your gift look beautiful. I'll definitely be shopping here again!

YUM!!!! That's what I think whenever I think of this place. I get the same thing each time because its just that delicious. Pollo Cubano. It's delicious chicken cooked in a sauce to die for (cumin, lime, orange, and garlic), and its served with maduros (friend sweet plantains), black beans, and rice. I ate every last bite, and couldn't get over how good it was!! I've only been here for lunch, but the service was great and prices were very reasonable. Especially since my opinion of Scottsdale is that a lot of places tend to be pretty overpriced. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars, is that I haven't really tried anything else but the pollo cubano, and I can't remember what my family got.

This the best "fast mexican food around". The chicken machaca is so delicious!! It's good quality food for cheap prices that doesn't leave you feeling really gross after. I also like the chip and salsa bar. I've been coming here since I was a little kid, and it always had the same great flavor.

we went here for dinner and drinks, and it was awesome. the giant soft pretzels are amazing, buttery, and delicious and are served with a roasted pepper cheese sauce. they are awesome, but get them to share, the butteryness is rich! the prices are reasonable, and the patio is nice to sit out on! even better than the food, service, and prices is the music!! they play an awesome selection of music!!

this was such a fun trail! it's a pretty good workout, it'll definitely get your heart pumping! there's no water at the trailhead, so plan accordinly. also, the hike back down can be pretty slipperly with all the gravel, so be careful.

i love this place. its a gas station with gourmet food, good prices, and good service. and the market has a lot of cool specialty items you won't necessarily find elsewhere. I've had the salad that has grilled chicken, cranberries, gorgonzola cheese, and it is wonderful. and huge. so it wouldn't be the worst idea to share, or plan on enjoying some later! for breakfast i got the bacon benedict, and it was delicious. my brother had that too and we both loved it. the grit cakes that come with it are really yummy! my grandma has the breakfast wrap and she really enjoyed it as well. if you're in the area, definitely make it a point to enjoy a meal here!

I love this place! the food is really fresh and delicious. i've had the grilled chicken salad a few times, and it's always delicious - the honey chipotle vinaigrette is wonderful! i've also had the bacon eggs benedict for breakfast, which was also really good. my grandma's bleu cheese burger was excellent! i highly recommend this place!

O.M.G. This place is INCREDIBLE! This is the place to go if you want some authentic mexican food. We went with a group of ten and ordered a wide variety of the menu, everything is amazing. The guac, the street tacos, the mole, a few things whose names I don't remember. The point is you can't go wrong. Definitely get a margarita. What's even better than the incredible food is that the service is good, it's a family owned business, AND the prices are great!
