I was on a quest for a good turkey burger, it was my birthday and everyone partied the night before...everyone but myself was hungover so I had to wait until 4pm to get out of the house. my partner recommended this place. Walked right in and got seated right away.  Asked the server about the turkey burgers she said they were really good so I got one with lettuce onion and mustard. It was okay, a bit disappointing but I gave it a shot. Fries were bottomless but not great. Ordered the rusty nail cocktail which tasted like frozen ice with a dash of banana no kahlua and couldn't taste the rum. Not rushing back here anytime soon.

I felt like pizza so this was closest stop. Haven't been here in a really long time so decided to give it a whirl. The board outside said 2 slices and a coke for 4.50. Sign said seat yourself. Ordered a water to drink, was a toss up between a sandwich or pizza/wings. Decided to go with special. Server comes over I ordered she said the special is actually 4.95 not 4.50, well then change it. Anyways not a big deal, she didn't ask if I wanted a Coke I'm assuming because she seen my water. Food came out and it looked good. I was disappointed that the crust was too doughy and may have ruined the extra cheese experience. Meh...not rushing back..

The way I see it...I'm not gonna go to New York and complain about Mexican food, not gonna complain about Seafood in Arizona, not gonna go to Detroit and complain about Hatch Chili...common sense tells me that a business will Use resources available to imitate what they are used to wherever "back home" may be. There's a fine line between complaining(crazy assumption that food should be the same as it's origin) and reviewing(telling us what the food tasted like, not what it "should" taste like) establishments.  For this review, love the cheese pizza, Italian sub and hot boneless wings.  Of course is the disclaimer that if an establishment actually claims ingredients, supplies, etc... Then it should own up to it's claim...

3.5--Took too long to completet the review but I believe my partner had the chicken vindaloo, we had various chutney's, and I ordered the Tandoori chicken. It thought everything was good. One of the chutneys was nice and spicy so my son, who is very particular, okay picky actually enjoyed it with a side of rice and chicken appetizer. Overall, the service was good and so was the food, would visit again...

3.75---my nephew and I went to eat. He loves pizza. Place was fairly busy, we were seated right away. Ordered a small pepperoni and the server recommended four seasons. Came out quicker than expected. The four seasons had prosciutto, tomato, black olives, artichokes, and mushrooms. It was 2 pieces with prosciutto-tomato, prosciutto-black olives, and so on. It was surprisingly good, two things though: place is pricey (40 for us two) and the crust was too soggy. It didn't hold the ingredients well but was very good otherwise. Would definitely give it another shot.

All I can say is jalapeño bacon!!!!!!   Okay really wanted the best or one of the best burgers in Vegas OTS. After several reviews we decided to give it a shot. Decided on the Kobe with cheddar and all the fix ins. Gf had the black angus beef w/jalapeno bacon, cheese, shared fries and had a beer. Bartender recommended an IPA for me (delicious, creamy not too heavy and potent). I am coming to the realization that I am not a huge Kobe fan but for some reason I keep trying. Fries came first, average steak fries with Good ranch. Burgers came and mine was okay. GF's burger was awesome. Perfectly cooked-med-but it was the jalapeno bacon that made the meal. It was spicy and delicious a must try. I would definitely return and try more beer other options and dessert!

We were looking for something in between fast food and pretentious. Finally decided here because, frankly, I was tired of walking. Hostess said would be a 30 minute wait, no problem I'll just gamble a little. 10 minutes later, our pager went off. Had to wait a couple more minutes while they changed out table cloth. Anyway, received water right away. Our waiter came over very friendly, outgoing. He recommended the skate because I was gonna order the salmon. My gf got the special, prime rib w/ aus jus macaroni au gratin and green beans . Skate came with a fennel, red onion, green bean salad..it was prepared with lemon capers parsley..and had homemade garlic chips. Garlic chips were great, light with garlic taste. Skate was an interesting fish, kinda chewy but the way it was prepared was delicious. A bit salty but im certain it was the capers. The lemon was delightful. Salad was good it was light and made with oil and balsamic vinegar. Prime rib was cooked med-rare, this was delicious.  So tender and flavorful, really good. My gf wanted to send it back because it was not hot...I assumed thats the French way..I didn't even notice and I like my food HOT! The potatoes were great, nice little crunch but great texture in middle. Almost forgot, i ordered the french onion soup and it was very nice flavorful, very cheesy-yummy, and bread was good. Try it just to try it. Nice little baguette with butter too.   Overall, place was great and if it wasn't for this land having thousands of restaurants I would definitely make it back here.

Got a comp so the staff recommended this place. I was between breakfast and lunch so I decided on the "raffle" specialty, filet benedict. Gf ordered hash. Came out quickly. Big plate w/. hashbrowns, two filets béarnaise sauce over poached eggs and muffins. One egg was hard and the filet with it was medium well ( I ordered medium rare), other set was perfect. Sauce was cool and didn't taste like béarnaise idk...hash browns were bland and I added much salt and pepper to help em out. Ate the filets cause I was starving and after I added salt and pepper they got better. The hash was okay, huge portions..I wouldn't come back unless I was wasted and needed help preventing the blues the next day! ;)

Finally made a reservation after months of wanting to try this place. Got there a little early and was seated right away (what a plus, rarely happens). Water came right away. Service was great and atmosphere was pleasant. I planned on spending 150-200(without tip) on this dinner..Boy did I walk away happy and a little heavy in the pocket book.  Getting right to it, I ordered the broiled swordfish with truffle fries. My gf ordered scallops with macadamia nuts and citrus. We ordered a caesar salad, spinach sauteed in garlic and shallots, and truffle mac n cheese. Wow! Meals were surprisingly plentiful and looked great. My swordfish was excellent (firm yet succulent) and the fries were surprisingly good and plentiful. The scallops were good, I've had better but there were about 6/7 large sized which is unusual. The mac n cheese was so tasty (asiago, parm, w/truffles). Spinach was excellent. Well prepared not too garlicky or oniony(such words) idk...but nonetheless, great!  I broke down and ordered dessert (the waiter advised us in the beginning that its takes 15 min). Came out on fire, literally..A pineapple upside down cake with rum (i think), whipped cream, and a divine caramel sauce! OMG..the other table was gawking over the setting. It was incredible, a must try!   Overall, this was a great place. Unpretentious, elegant yet casual enough..I WILL be going back..Oh yeah, 100 bucks including two glasses of 7 Merlot that was easy on the palate!

I've been looking for a Mexican restaurant in South Scottsdale and after reading reviews I decided to go here. It was very authentic, servers were nice but we had a communication barrier..We ended up getting through that and I ordered two tacos-pork..Had chips and salsa-they have a little salsa bar-like set up-the salsa was awesome. They had a habanero salsa that was soooo good. It was hot and had a good flavor. Had the tacos and they were also good. It was very reasonable and I would definitely go back!  The place is very small so if you are taking a large group..it can get a little crowded...

I've been here a countless amount of times. I had been wanting Pei Wei for about two weeks. Finally decided To go and get lettuce wraps and one spring roll. Quick as always but wraps just didn't taste right. They had an "aftertaste" not a good one either. Spring roll was okay. Could taste the go ginger and the seaweed was too chewy. Very disappointed and am in no hurry to run back.

Decided to stop here for lunch and was Glad I did. Seated quickly. Ordered box lunch which consisted of 4 pieces of tuna (albacore and yellowfin), 4 California rolls, small salad, miso soup, a piece of teriyaki salmon, 2 shrimp tempura, 4 vegetable tempura, and rice! Wow!! Oh and edamame...ridiculous portion! Everything was really good. Salmon was cooked and portioned well. Teriyaki not bad. Shrimp good, well everything was surprisingly good and all for $10....that's right $10....the price for the portions and taste was deserving of 3.5 to 4 stars..service was also excellent...

After 30 minutes of deciding where to dine, we decided on NOCA. Not busy, seated right away. Service was great but serving was slow. It was okay because I had a time catching up with my GF. A server brought us a spoon filled with fig jam, cucumber, goat cheese, and mint. Was really good but a tease. About 10 minutes later brought us a cup of chilled potato soup. It was salty but good. Our order finally came, spinach salad-sliced apples, sugar coated pecans, pickled onions, manchego cheese, vinegarette. Was very good, the cheese was very good. GF order special, New York steak with green beans, fingerling potatoes, pearl onions, and a roasted red pepper relish. Excellent dish. Cooked perfectly, med-rare. Onions were incredible-sweet but delicious. Roasted red pepper relish was yummy. Cotton candy a plus. Finished off with a coffee and cappaccino-okay...Overall, if your not in a hurry and have some good company, try this place..  Disclaimer: Don't blame me if they have an "off" night. Mine was "on."

Stayed for an evening away..live in Tempe but wanted a little relaxation...went to bar upstairs to grab a drink. Beer selection ehhh..but opted for Hennessy Priv..and they have Pepsi!  Tyler was very cool and had someone bring up a coke from sushi roku downstairs. Very friendly nice atmosphere perfect! I'll have to try it when it's busy and see what happens but so far so good..oh decor is cool and modern, rooms are a bit small but unless you're gonna party in it...they are nice and relaxing.

My partner and I decided we wanted a steak and wanted to try a new place. We decided on Verona Chophouse because I don't remember having a bad steak at a Casino! Anyways, we were seated right away. The ambiance was a pleasant surprise. It was dark, somewhat elegant, and there was a piano man. Our server was nice but sloooow. It took about 10 minutes to receive our drinks. I seen them at sitting at the bar and was very close to walking over and getting our drinks. We both got the 8 oz Filet-medium, I got the sauteed Spinach and my girlfriend got a baked potato. Our server brought us warm bread with oil, balsamic vinegar, pepper, and parmesan. I didn't particularly care for the balsamic vinegar and I normally really like it. Anyways, we enjoyed our view (an outdoor like setting with chairs and fireplaces separates another restaurant). Our food arrived, our waters were refilled and we began eating.  My initial bite was not good. It was too crunchy, dry and tasted old (probably too cooked). As I got to the middle it was like a different steak. It was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. I ate the entire thing because it cost $23, so I wasn't leaving anything. The spinach was delicious. Overall, the place was good, the ambiance was great the service mediocre.   One more thing..it didn't seem smokey or noisy at all for being in a casino. The booth we were in was "broken" the seat was sinking so we just moved over...

I've been going to La Canasta for as long as I can recall. I live in Tempe and can't go as often as I'd  like but I go at least once a month. I love this Canasta because they have a green chile salsa and menudo every day! Always quick and fresh. I either get the ground beef tacos (yummy), the red chile burrito (watch out), or the menudo (got a hangover?). It is very consistent and prices, well it adds up, but it is worth it. I have yet to have a bad experience after 28 years!

I was expected the typical In n Out, Five Guys, etc...but was not...Ordered create your own 1/3lb(lettuce, onion, cheddar, mustard, and FRESH jalapenos), smash fries and a coke. Very juicy flavorful and just Good! I found my new burger joint! It's not the best I've had but it is good enough to have me going back for more. Smash fries have rosemary and garlic and quite frankly you must like rosemary to like the fries. I like rosemary! Coke products is always a plus for me. They also offer rootbeer in a bottle and shakes. If you're looking for a good juicy burger this is the place...  Note: I went to the Tempe location for a burger to go...HOCKEY PUCK! Advised the manager and he comped my next meal which was good...

3.5 --Decided to try this place based on reviews. Was thinking it would be busy but when I walked in not too many people. I went to counter said it was my first visit gave me a menu. Lots of items on the menu. Opted for seasonal omelet, egg whites, cheese, hash, toast. They do offer vegan choices(vegan cheese, tofu). It took a bit to receive my coffee (served gentleman behind me first) and my meal. The plate was plentiful and very fresh. The hash were a potatoes, squash with rosemary. Different but good. The omelet was also fresh but not quite enough cheese. The veggies were squash, carrots (orange, yellow, purple). All in all, I would give this place another shot. Love the freshness...My meal was $14

Decided to try this play after driving by. Very blah inside...was greeted and seated right away. Had typical deli meals..roast beef, pastrami, lox, etc...we went for breakfast. I ordered French toast, gf ordered hash. French toast came with a bagel and hash came with toast, home fries, and 2 eggs. French toast was great by itself(cinnamon and fluffy). Bagel was Mediocre. Hash looked ground and brown. It tasted, I guess, a bit old. Home fries were really good had sauteed onion.   Now on to the real issue..two tables Next to us were ready whispering (complaining). Made me wonder. Guess the server forgot to add sausage but assured him it would be ready when his pancakes were. Guess what! Pancakes came out but the sausage didn't. Owner came and rectified the situation. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed. She was okay, seemed timid but she got everything right so. I would come back for lunch or dinner..the egg sandwiches looked good.
