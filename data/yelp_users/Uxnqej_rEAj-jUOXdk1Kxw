Holy shit...I just found my most favorite Mexican food EVER...and it's about 1,500 miles from home! You've got to be kidding me, right?!? How's that for a slap in the face?!?  On a 6 day vacation, we ended up here 3 times and our drive was about 20-25 minutes each way. It's that good folks! If I lived closer, I would have been more adventures and tried more things on the menu...but the feeling of not eating more machacha made me want to cry.   A #7 combo is where it's at. The machaca is AMAZING. I also had a bite of a chorizo burro, also amazing but I had to stick to the tacos.   Pro Tip: Don't be fooled by the horchata in the fountain drink thing-a-ma-bob....it's awesome! Give it a swish in your cup and you're good to go!

What a joke!!! This Hertz is THE worst car rental place at PHX Airport.   We got there and waited in a line for a short period of time so that we could speak to a virtual agent and get the process rolling and thought we were well on our way. WRONG!!!! Fast forward 1 hour later, waiting with about 40 others in the shared space right outside of Hertz and we finally get our very dirty car. Crayons everywhere. Not washed. Not vaccumed.   I realize it's March. I realize you probably have more cars going out then coming in. Don't overbook. You guys suck! I'll never rent from Hertz again.   Even the virtual agent we spoke to to get our car rental going said what a joke this location is. She said they need to "get it together". I coudln't agree more.  On a side note, mini-vans rock!

Came to AZ for spring training... Ate at Pita Jungle 5 of the 6 days I was in AZ. Don't judge me! When I see something I like, I go for it... ;)   Anywho, I found this place last year, after I checked out of my hotel, on the way to the airport. Love at first sight... Seriously. I was pissed that I found it on the last f'n hour that I was in AZ. WTF. So I had a whole year to look forward to eating at the heavenly place again...   The Hummus is the most amazing that I've ever had in my life. I recommend the Cilantro/Jalapeno Hummus. Amazing!   While I was there I had the Original Hummus (amazing), Cilantro/Jalapeno Hummus (also amazing), 4 Cheese Quesadilla (once with chicken, once with steak [I'd prefer it without meat but just had a few bite of someone else's]) (amazing), Greek Salad (good, but not the best I've had), Mediterranean Roasted Chicken (really f'n good, and big!), Falafel (yeah baby, perfect), Lentil soup (I've had better, but it's still pretty good), Pesto Lavosh Wrap (I did chicken [recommended by our outstanding waiter] instead of turkey, awesome and big!)

Oh Pita Jungle, I've returned...and my commitment to you is still intact.  It's hard to please everyone in a group of 8 when deciding where to head out for dinner but I somehow managed to convince everyone to head over to Pita Jungle while on vacation one night.  I went back to old trusty when I ordered the Cilantro/Jalepeno hummus for the table. EVERYONE enjoyed this. There was even talks of "Ohhhh, I want to learn how to make this" (since we sadly don't have a PJ here in Chicago). Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals and the $3 glasses of sangria can't be beat. I had a chicken shawarma pita and it was just as excellent as I remembered! Fast forward 2 days later, and I'm back at it again. Of course we had the Cilantro/Jalepeno hummus and $3 sangrias. This time for my main course I had the Wood-Fired Chicken which is Wood-fired marinated chicken breast on a bed of wilted spinach and garlic herb smashed potatoes with a light garlic tomato sauce. The tomato sauce is amazing! The chicken breast was plump and juicy.  I wish I would have tried this entr√©e sooner, it was amazing. Eating here proves that if you want delicious and healthy options, you can go out to a restaurant to get it.   The staff couldn't be friendlier. Our food was taking longer than they expected (honestly, we didn't think it was taking a long time...we're used to waiting a lot longer for things here in Chi-City) and our server, the manager, and even the chef apologized to us and offered up another appetizer for us to enjoy. We were all blown away by how friendly and awesome the service is.   Pita Jungle will forever be one of my most favorite places. It's just so perfect.

If you have kids, this is the place for you....or maybe if you want to go on a action packed date...or you just want to play acrade games...or mini golf on one of their three courses...or go get all Danica Patrick on the race track...or get all wet and wild on the water slides.   Golfland Sunsplash is an action packed kid and adult playground.   p.s. I'm probably the worst mini golfer alive. Yowza!

This is probably the trashiest bar I've EVER been to and I've been to some pretty bad places. A guy we were there with went outside and got punched square in the nose and then the puncher after landing said punch (pretty nice shot, had the punchee bleeding) ran away. Funny as anything, but a shitty move... The bathrooms are gross. The floor was sticky (not just a sticky spot but the WHOLE floor).  Oh Vine Tavern even though you made me laugh my ass off I'm not sure I'll be back...

As a true Cubs fan, my destination of choice during the month of March is Arizona.   Hohokam Park is my #1 choice while I'm in AZ and here's why:  1. It's 80 degrees here, it's 15 degrees at home 2. Inexpensive game tickets (if you don't get them from the ticket website, don't worry, there are plenty of scalpers close to the park) 3. $5 parking!!! 4. The Asian Noodles at the park are AWESOME! Yup, I eat noodles at the ball park, in the middle of March, in the blazing sun, and drink a beer. You should do this too.  5. One time while I was waiting in line to get a hot dog, Ernie Banks walked past me and I thought it was just THE coolest thing ever.   6. Hohokam has an up-close and personal kinda feel when it comes to the players. They will actually give autographs at Spring Training (if the timing is right [i.e. when they're leaving the ball park, or entering the ball park}) 7. Last time I was here, I met and Fergie Jenkins and Jay Johnstone and got some autographed baseballs from them. Jay talked to us for quite some time.  8. I think Hohokam might be the only AZ Spring Training park that tailgates.   A few tips from the spring training pro: The bottled water outside the park is cheaper and colder, buy it. If you have lawn tickets, get there early, bring a blanket to sit on. Ronny Woo Woo, is going to be there, he's nice and you should be nice to him (he once beat me in a hula-hoop contest after the game in the parking lot, he also left voicemails for my friends back at home in Chicago). Respect your elders because there are  A LOT of em here...afterall, they probably are Chicago transplants and could teach you a couple things.   Cubs fan or not, make sure to visit Hohokam, you're bound to love it!   Go Cubs!

While out in AZ for Spring Training (GO CUBS!) we ended up at Baer's Den probably 4 or 5 of our 7 night stay. This place is awesome! $2 Mighty on tap (think Fat Tire), what a f'n deal... We drank the crap out of that Mighty, Mighty! Anywho, I met some amazing folks over at Baer's Den and have stayed in touch with them since being there and plan on meeting them back out there in March 2010... Oh and let's not forget the stripper pole, it's a stripper pole made for people 5' or shorter... It's actually hysterical and the drunk men seemed to give it a whirl more then the ladies.    BTW, staff is super friendly too.... Food, I'd give it a "B". Great drink prices. The owner was super friendly. Overall, LOVE IT!  Thanks for the memories. See ya soon!

I visited Camelback Ranch back in it's debut season...it sure is nice lookin'. It actually almost felt too nice for a baseball stadium.   Went to a Cubs/Dodgers game back in the day when Zambrano wasn't such a head case...it was nice, we won :) I was pretty hungover so I didn't drink (maybe only a beer or 2), eat, or move much from my lawn seat. Camelback Ranch is pretty big, and you will be walking a lot so I don't recommend being hungover when coming here. The parking lots are a hike. The stadium is large and clean. The bathrooms weren't crappy. The prices on food/beer were perfect (even though I didn't eat, I remember all of the prices were very reasonable). The ticket prices are a little high for a spring training game, you can sit in the lawn for 1/2 the price of sitting in the seats. I'd recommend that, but show up early to get a good spot (bring a towel or blanket)  All in all, a too clean stadium for a baseball game...but me likes! Remember to wear your walkin' shoes!

Do you think you can go to a Brewers home game and not see the Sausage races? The answer is clearly no because those sausages make the 1,883 mile trek across the country to make your month of March that much more fun.   Easy parking at Maryvale Baseball Park and only $6. You'll want to leave a little early because getting into/out of the parking lot can be a bit of a nightmare because the lines of cars are long...but that's to be expected at any sporting event that you go to.  Lots of concession stands (great food) and clean restrooms. Super inexpensive game tickets. For some games it might cost ya only $25 bucks to sit in the 1st row.   Just like at home in Chicago & Milwaukee, the Cubs/Brewers games will probably get a little heated between fans. This game WILL sell out so i'd recommend getting tickets right when they go on sale.

So I just climbed up "A" hill/mountain/whatever and needed to replenish a few calories... I went in search of Cold Stone Creamery, and was very surprised to walk into what used to be CSC is now Sparky's Old Town Creamery. It's pretty much the same darn thing, just as good, same ice cream, same toppings, etc. If you like CSC, you'll really like Sparky's Old Town Creamery.   I had the banana ice cream, with walnuts and bananas. Wow ,Mouthgasim.

TWO ($2) DOLLAR ICE CREAM SANDWICHES?!?! What? Yup, you heard me right....these delicious and heaping ice cream sandwiches are only 2 buck-a-roonies.   When I say ice cream sandwich, you probably think of those ones that you buy from the ice cream section at the grocery store...that's exactly what I thought when someone suggested going to get Ice Cream Sandwiches. My initial reaction was "meh, borning ice cream sandwiches" but then as soon as I walked in the doors, all of my worries were put behind me. Slickables Ice Cream Sandwiches is a big heaping scoop of ice cream sandwiched between two cookies. I opted for two double chocolate chip cookies and peanut butter cup ice cream. The flavors were amazing and I was impressed! The variety of sandwiches you could make here is insane...or you could go the simple route and still have your socks knocked off.

I wanted to lovvvvve my stay here. I  booked 4 rooms with the most fantastic person in the world, the manager Louise, and everything went off without a hitch. The staff here is decent (except the shuttle bus driver...but I'll get to that). The hotel itself is clean and quiet for the most part, so if you're just looking for a place to sleep, you'll be happy.   Let's start off with my least favorite person/people on the trip...The shuttle bus driver. The man does NOTHING all day. We were in a group of 8 and we asked for a shuttle ride 3 times and were denied 3 times. The first time, 2 people flew into the airport and needed a ride to the hotel, they called the hotel and they said that "he didn't show up for work" but if they took a cab, they would be reimbursed. Well, that was nice and much appreciated by them. The second time we tried to utilize the shuttle was to take us to Hohokam, but the shuttle bus driver said he "might be to busy to take us". Ummm, isn't that your job? I mean, to take people places. I was promised by the hotel that you would take us there...but you're too busy to do your job? That's cool...why don't you just keep sitting there eating breakfast ALL morning (I'll get to that...). The third time we needed to use the shuttle was to take 2 people to the airport the night that they were flying out. We called down to arrange and again were told that the driver didn't show up. Wow. Fire him! The whole 6 days we stayed there, I saw the shuttle van move one time. ONCE!!!   Next up, breakfast. Anywhere in the Phoenix metro is going to be slam-jammed in March. Us baseball fans will pack your hotel, as a matter of face it will probably be at  100% capacity during March. If you offer breakfast, have enough food. Every single day, our hotel ran out of certain things. Little milk cartons, biscuits (they had gravy...the breakfast lady told me to use regular bread. haha. asshole), cinnamon rolls, bananas, pancake batter, sausage, bacon, eggs, etc. Those are just a few of the things they kept running out of while I was there for 6 days. One thing I noticed that the shuttle bus driver actually did well was (and probably what kept him SO busy) eat breakfast all morning. Yup, the same stuff that they were running out of, was being chowed down by the lazy ass bus driver. I can't stand a lazy person who just takes advantage of stuff. He's useless.   The pool at the hotel is small and doesn't look like it was cleaned in ages. I'm sure it was, but seriously I wouldn't even dip my toe in there, that's how disgusted I was.   I booked 4 King rooms, but we only got 2 king rooms. The other two were queen rooms. Again, very disappointed that we all didn't get the rooms that were originally booked.    Ummm yeah... Sadly I won't be staying here again. Besides Louise, everything was a huge fail in my book.
