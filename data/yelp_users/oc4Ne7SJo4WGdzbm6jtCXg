This was my first time at this location.  I've frequented the Upper St Clair Galleria restaurant.  There's a lot to like about this Columbus OH based chain.  I don't usually eat at chain restaurants nor will I review them because they're typically big food corporate run places that don't care what they feed you they just care about their stockholders.  This place seems different to me.  The food quality and care seems to be very high.    The staff is always well trained.  I like the decor and ambiance.  The menu offers many options.  I don't really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall I am a fan.  I do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here.  I like to buy the trout and prepare it at home.    We were here for a Thanksgiving meet-up event with 69 other people.  The room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall.  It's a tough thing to do.  It wasn't perfect for sure but the food was surprisingly good and came out hot and fresh.  Nicely done.

I hate going to the dentist.  I dread it, it's awful.  It's really important and is vital to your long term well being, however, and I do my best to suck it up.  Harvey is the best dentist that I have been to.  He's a holistic practitioner.  He's done a deep cleaning (worst thing that I could ever imagine), has removed and replaced my lead ("silver") fillings.  This was important to me and he did them with vacuums so that no trace amounts would be ingested on my part.  He introduced me to a terrific mouth wash that has really made a difference in the health of my gums.  You can tell he really cares about me and my health and I really appreciate how thorough and conscientious he is.

My wife and I have been eating here for many years now. We almost always go for the lunch buffet and have eaten here at least 25-30 times now. The menu items change every time we're here so sometimes we like it better than others and range from really thrilled by the food to feeling it's ok but are never disappointed. The owners/staff are really very nice too and they serve you fresh naan to order. I am writing now after all these years because another Indian restaurant opened a stones throw away and I want to make sure you try Namaste instead. The service and attitude at the other are just this side of rude and indifferent. Yesterday, I had baigan bharta, chana masala, palak paneer, pakora, chicken tandoor, onion naan and masala tea and all were very very good.  I skipped the chicken curry, carrots/peas, rice and tomato soup but thought I would list them to give you an idea of what else they had yesterday.  All for $7.95. I hope you'll stop by and give it a try.

This is the best Pittsburgh has to offer in authentic Vietnamese.  I have eaten here several times in the past 7 years or so and have tried several of the items on the menu with success.  I like to order bun with chicken and pork spring rolls.  I also like the Hieu Tu.  Basically chicken pho but with chicken broth instead of beef.  This is typically my go to dish here and it's very good.  It's a small family run place without a lot of slick ambiance.  I wouldn't say you'd be wow'd by the decor but the service is friendly and efficient.  I am always glad I dined here.

This is a really cool Middle Eastern market with a counter top dining area.  You order at the register and either take it to go or sit around the perimeter of their kitchen area on stools.  They have a nice menu of classic pita sandwiches, salads and your favorite sides.  I tried the lamb burger.  It was terrific.  It had feta, arugula, pickled onions and a garlic mayo on ciabatta.  I'm missing something here but you get the idea.  I ordered in medium and it was perfectly pink throughout.    They had live music on Saturday.  I enjoyed the music while I ate then strolled the market and sampled some olives, perused the hummus and baba ganoush selection and was tempted by the dessert case.  They have oils, bins of pulses and frozen imported delicacies and cheeses from far off lands.  They make their own pita and you can see the production line behind glass as you shop.  This place is totally worth checking out and I'll be back soon.

This time I brought my partner in culinary adventure and I ordered a Gyro and some fries.  My wife ordered a falafel plate.  She said it was the best she's ever had.  I felt the same about my Gyro.  The fries were great.  They're seasoned with something I couldn't identify and served with tartar.  Awesome.  I wish you could order a small because for $4 it's a huge basket.  Way too much for a side with a sandwich.  Miriam helped me out and I did finish them.  They were too good to waste.  I also took a square of baklava home and again it was the best I have ever had anywhere.  This place is a treasure.  If I lived near here, I would be here all the time.

Stopped in for a couple quick slices of plain red sauce.  $1.60 each.  They were really great.  I loved the sauce, some of the best I have had.  I sprinkled some oregano over and it was great.  It was short of greatness, however, because of the amount of cheese.  Way too much and really hard to get down.  I would definitely go back and order a pie with 1/2 the amount of cheese and some toppings.  Some may love the cheese but I, like Darren, found it overwhelming.

Some good some bad.  This goes for the food and the service.  You MUST check your order if it's to go in any of the locations.  I have had more mistakes than correct orders in the last year or so.    The "presses" are MICROWAVES.  They are not training their employees to know this and they are not making it public.  I had an employee actually argue about it with me this morning because I wanted them to toast my bagel and assemble the egg and cheese without nuking it.  I got to my car and they had forgotten the cheese.  I went back and the cook told me that the counter person didn't know if I wanted it!  I think someone should have double checked if this was the case as the sandwich comes with cheese to begin with.  Even Burger King doesn't microwave their breakfast!

I like the new remodel.  The isles are deep and the seats are great.  I thought the rake of the floor wasn't really steep enough but no one sat in front of me so that I could test out my theory that someone large would block my view.  It's really expensive.  I'm not sure if the other 5 rooms have stadium seating or not.  The bargain matinee is usually the first show but not here.... it's between 4 and 5:30.  It's $9 for the first show of the day.  Maybe I am showing my age but this seems like a ton of money.  It's $5.75 for the late afternoon bargain.  I would come back for a cheap show.  Overall, it's one of the nicer places to see a film in the area.

I ordered fried chicken, greens, red beans and corn bread.  The fried chicken was delicious.  Crispy and moist, the chicken itself was really tasty.  The greens were good, solid but nothing special.  The beans really needed seasoning.  The corn bread was perfect.  I also ordered the fried green tomato appetizer.  These had a really tough breading and needed a better accompaniment.  I also wish they had Tobasco or Louisianna Hot Sauce because Texas Pete and whatever Mexican and Vietnamese sauces just aren't really appropriate with this food in my opinion.  I wouldn't have needed it but everything needed a bit of something.  This is really a 3 1/2 star place for me.  I love the place itself and the service has always been pretty good, the prices are very good too.  This is a good place to go if you are downtown.

This place isn't nice enough to be a Hilton. Very outdated.  I asked for a nice room as a Diamond member and they gave me a room with a view of the HVAC (complete with the noise) and view of the highway. I wasted 7 nights worth of points on this place. Pathetic concierge lounge. This is really depressing!  They moved us to a higher floor in the front of the hotel. It's quieter. The TVs are tiny and Conan was orange last night. Would be fine if this was a Hampton or if Hilton hadn't devalued its points and raised their rates. At least Marriott gives lifetime Platinum to its longtime loyal customers.   I wonder what European travelers think when they come and receive this level of hospitality compared to the high level over there.

I had fun, it's a beautiful place.  The service was really good and I love buffet dining.  Here's the thing.  The food ranged from bad to just ok.  I am there for the food.  There are a couple reviews about this restaurant that exclaim that it's the best buffet ever.  I should have really ignored them and focused on all the more critical reviews on this restaurant as they really rang true.  Normally when the reviews are this mixed I stay far away.    I don't know where to begin.  How about the omelet station.  It takes a tremendous amount of skill to make a good omelet on a flat top.  It just isn't done this way.  You have to spread out a lot of egg and quickly fold it onto itself to give it any depth.  If you leave it flat, it's done before you can warm any ingredients or melt any cheese.  I watched rubbery brown thin wrappers of egg surround cold and bland ingredients flow from a well meaning omelet station attendant.  How could you?   I didn't realize it until later but if you're looking for the french toast, it's hidden in back of the omelet station in a hotel pan.  I never did find it until we were on our way out the door.    The best 2 things about this brunch were the automatic donut machine and the bagels.  Neither of which this place makes on their own.  In fact, I noted quite a few things they don't actually prepare here at all.    The meat carving station looked nice and I chose the Gobi Dessert of pork loins.  It isn't 1950 and you don't have to cook pork within an inch of it's life anymore.  There wasn't anyone in the kitchen today that knows how lean a cut this is and how if you're going to put it out on a carving station it should be cooked til slightly pink in the center.   The desert station isn't worth my time to talk about.  There isn't a real pastry chef there and the cookies were clearly out of a box.  The chocolate cake tasted like Duncan Hines with the frosting that you get out of a can.  Another sad and depressing effort here in the Burgh.  Sigh.

Discovered thanks to fellow Yelpers for lunch the other day and they didn't let me down.  This is a really fun place with lots of menu items to choose from.  I opted for the salad bar and 3 pcs of their broasted chicken.  They have an excellent salad bar.  I like their potato salad and cole slaw very much.  The variety of vegetables is very good but they need to label the salad dressings.  The chicken is crispy and nicely seasoned.  It's still fried chicken but supposedly pressure cooking imparts less oil.  This seemed true enough for this bird as it wasn't greasy, just delicious.  The staff is friendly and I love the place.  I'll be back for more.

This is a really fun looking place and it smelled great from the street.  You order at the counter and they call your number.  The place was really busy on a Sunday.  I ate lunch there today and ordered a 1/2 slab, slaw and beans.  I would like to give this place 2 1/2 stars but am erring low because the ribs were so tough, I couldn't eat most of them.  I actually couldn't get them apart to eat them.  The beans and slaw were a-ok but since I was there for the BBQ, I had to give them 2 stars.  It's really too bad because the flavors were really good and the sauce is really solid.  I will be back to try the chicken next time and may update the review at that time.  I would try it if I were you but I would definately skip the ribs.

This is one of the coolest and most interesting museum experiences you will find.  It's truly a world class art museum and challenges you to think about the art and images around you in your every day life. Without any doubt, the finest collection of Warhol's work assembled in every type of medium he explored including television.    The staff is terrific.  Parking is just across the street and it's easily accessible.   If you've never been you must go and if you've only been once and several years ago, you have to visit often as part of their mission statement is to change things up often.  I visited last night and it was completely different from my last visit a couple years ago.  This place is probably one of the best things Pittsburgh has to offer so don't miss it.

I am from Chicago and my wife and I had terrific authentic Mexican food there.  This restaurant is as close as we've found to that experience in this area.   I ordered 2 tacos and a side of beans.  While we waited we really enjoyed the salsa and chips.  The salsa was really nice with notes of oregano and the perfect spice level.  My tacos were very nicely prepared.  The corn tortillas were very good.  I had the barbacoa and the chicken mole tacos.  The mole was very good and the chicken was perfect.  Both tacos had a large quantity of rice, very spicy rice.  It's the first time I have experienced this and would have to ask them not to do it next time.  It tasted of cayenne and really overpowered the barbacoa taco entirely.  The mole should have come with onions instead in my opinion.  Both were very tasty and I really liked them, nonetheless.  I ordered a side of beans and they were terrific.   I will definitely go back and try some other dishes on their menu.  The staff is friendly and service is very good.  I liked the authentic Mexico City vibe of their place as well.

My wife and I had lunch with another couple today. This was my first trip so I decided to go with what the reviews say are must eats. I had mussels in red curry and an order of fries. The mussels were perfectly done and very tasty. I loved the red curry, light and bright tasting with ginger and a nice crusty baguette to sop with. The fries were a little greasy, really too oily to pair with a very heavy mayo. The mayo was nice but could be lighter. My wife liked her salad very much, the salmon was perhaps a bit overdone and another second and would have been too dry. She thought the chevre that came on the salad was terrific. I tried a few bites of the chocolate mousse cake and it was pretty good too. Good coffee. The service was very good. We'll definitely go back to try some more menu items at dinner.   It's 3.5 stars for me.

Review Date: 08/15/2009      My wife and I ate here last night and were really disappointed in the food. It's a nice looking place and the menu and service were ok. The house serves a small baguette and a ramekin of humus. The bread was average and the humus only tasted of garlic. Should have tasted of chickpeas with notes of garlic, it was heavy and cloying.     I ordered the roasted veg salad and the rack of lamb. The veg salad should really have been a tapas, not a large bowl of lettuce with some vegetables in it. The vegetables were bland and underseasoned and the balsamic dressing missed the mark entirely. This should have been a small plate of grilled vegetables redolent with sea salt and pepper and dressed in a fruity Spanish olive oil. We should have been offered fresh ground pepper with our salads, it would have helped them a little. The rack of lamb was 2 chops (not a rack) and they were deep fried. We couldn't taste the lamb under the terrible taste of the deep fryer and mystery batter. The sauce on the plate was bitter and the couscous was entirely forgettable. This dish was almost inedible.     My wife had the artichoke salad. Again, a huge plate of greens with a dozen artichoke hearts that had a terrible aftertaste. We both tried them and couldn't eat them. She followed with the ceviche. I had hoped it would taste of the ocean. Briny and just a little salty with bright acid tones and maybe a little green chili. This was as bland as you can imagine. The textures were good but the dish had very little flavor. I did catch a bitter lime note, we tried salting the dish and it was a little better but entirely forgettable at best.     Another second rate Pittsburgh restaurant. The owners would be served to import some chefs and maybe leave the area to try some better food to see what it tastes like before serving us this terrible excuse for a meal. My wife and I have over 25 years in combined food service experience.

I've eaten here and at the place on the strip multiple times.  I will sum it up like this.  breakfast doesn't have to be greasy, sugary and disgustingly bad for you.  It doesn't.  You can get great potatoes without having to have your heart stop.  Even the eggs come out swimming in fat.  The bottom of my plate is just one big oil slick every time I go there.  The pancakes are thin because they're weighed down by 1000g of fat and again swimming in fat on your plate.   They're heavy, rich and just not necessary unless you're ordering them for desert and then I would serve 1/2 an order.  Nothing they make that I have tried is prepared with any care or finesse.  It's all over the top and it's not funny anymore.   Buy quality ingredients, prepare them properly without too much fat or sugar, season them properly and let them sing.    Breakfast is one of my favorite meals.  I should really start a Yelp list of some of my favorite places come to think of it.  I'm always sorry I ate here every time I get sucked in.  By the way, do something to filter your water because it tastes awful and is probably why the coffee is so bad.  Probably one of the better breakfasts in the Pittsburgh area if you're comparing regions which tells you about the quality of the food here.  I think Deluca's does a better job if you insist on eating out for breakfast in the 'burgh.

This was my second visit to this tiny restaurant on the main drag in Mt Lebanon.  I had been once before a couple years ago for dinner but decided to try lunch while in the area.  I had ordered a tagine for dinner and wasn't in love with it.  It was really heavy as I recall even though I had ordered chicken.  It was awhile ago but I can remember thinking it was expensive and not brilliant.    I ordered the appetizer platter for lunch and it was absolutely terrific.  It had a black bean hummus, vegetable hummus, roasted vegetables and an eggplant dish.  It was served with a small side salad minty and lightly dressed and surrounded by a fortress of grilled pita wedges.  We were going to go to Aladdins but their pita is thin and looks and tastes like shoe leather.  This pita was really nice.   It had a grilled flavor and was a quality product.  The hummus were great.  I loved the vegetable hummus, it was spicy and nicely seasoned.  Everything on the plate was delicious.    I would definitely come back and try some more.  I should have given them another chance years ago.

I would love to give them one star based on last nights Thanksgiving nightmare but my wife says I shouldn't rate them at all based on a holiday.  I think it's quite the opposite and they should have exceeded all expectations because it was a holiday.  They trashed my Thanksgiving.  It's a big deal.  If you aren't prepared to handle it, you should have let go of the greed and been closed.  I could write a novel about this terrible evening.  It was just one bad after another.    We came in a sat at a table in the bar area while we waited until our 7:30 room to be ready.  We were there with a group split into 2 large tables.  There were only 2 people working the bar area and that included running food and making all the drinks for the restaurant.  I gave up waiting and waived for a couple drinks.  We ordered Kentucky Smashes and they were very good.  The Old Blue I ordered later was a lot less successful.    At 7:35, I went to the host stand and they said a previous group was lingering and it would be 5 minutes.  I pressed him and asked if he was lying as I was starving and asked that I be seated in the main dining for dinner if it wasn't going to be indeed 5 minutes.  He insisted.  You all know what's coming next right?  30 minutes later!  We complained to a server while still in the bar and she ran and got us the first course while we were in the bar.  Kudos to her for seeing that we were desperate for some food.    The service in the private room was sparse.  No one asked me if I wanted a drink or checked back to see if I wanted anything.  No one asked us if we wanted coffee or desert after our meal which was fine because it took 2 hours to get dinner!  They ran out of food and had to go to another location to get us food.  I can hardly believe they wouldn't just tell us what was going on and offer us something else to eat.  Meanwhile, Chris, the manager, lied to me again when I asked about food and said it would be up right away. You should have seen the dried out tough piece of meat they delivered to my dining companion!  That thing should NEVER EVER have left the kitchen.  When we said something, he offered to replace it but it was 9:30pm!!!!  Are you kidding me????    The food was ok.  The green beans were raw, the squash and apple casserole was a puree.  There's a difference.  The gravy was really salty and unfortunately I added it without tasting it and my plate ended up salty.  Ugh.  There's so much more I could share here.  I will never ever come back to this or another of their properties.  EVER.

Brenda is such a big fan of this place that I had to try it.  Now I'm sad that I didn't come here sooner.  Chinese food hasn't been high on my list for years now.  Too much oil, sugar and fried food.  It's hard to find much to eat at these places that isn't really ridiculously bad for you.  I've been twice now.  Yesterday I had a lunch special.  Kung Pao Chicken.  It says on the menu with tea and soup.  I picked hot and sour and was delivered won ton.  No matter.  I liked it just fine.  The Kung Pao was perfectly spicy for me and a good sized lunch portion.  It was good.  I wasn't offered any tea.  I first visited a week or so ago and my wife and I shared the mu shu pork and the szechwan chicken.  I loved the mu shu, it was a great example of this dish.  Not greasy and plenty of those cloud mushrooms I really like.  The chicken dish was perfectly cooked.  The chicken was moist and tender.  It was too sweet for my taste but the flavors all in all were really good.    The service is friendly and the food comes out lightning fast.  I like this place a lot.  They play classical music and it works with this really upscale interior.  The prices here are very fair.  I would return again and try to find more things on the menu that won't do me in.

This place does not pass as a restaurant. Fine if you want to say they know how to buy beer. Not much talent required there. This is an awful place to get a meal. They know nothing about food. I've tried 2 other locations. I didn't choose to eat at any of them. I was a victim of peer choices.  All pretty sub par to ridiculous.  I ordered the featured Bloody Mary. It came without a garnish. NOTHING. It was so spicy I couldn't drink it so I sent it back for something they couldn't ruin. A beer    It took an hour to get our food. I ordered mussels and frites. The mussels were good but were served with 2 pale, cold, sad, stale rolls. No sopping for me I guess. The frites were $3.50!  Small dish, cold, soggy, greasy and definitely NOT frites. You should have seen my wife's $16 burger. What a joke. I can't believe people line up to give them money here. This is the last time I eat at one of their pathetic excuses for a restaurant.  I feel completely violated and ripped off.

This is less a bar than a hotel lobby.  It lacks a cool vibe or any real feel at all.  I did enjoy listening to some nice music but beware the cocktail menu without the prices on the tables.  I ordered a drink and it was $20!  They didn't even garnish it as stated in the menu.  They forgot my wife's garnish as well.  The drink was ok.  It should have been unbelievable for $20.  Just skip it.

The place was freezing yesterday.  The plates were cold making the food cold.  I've eaten here a few times and have had about enough now.  They refuse to put small bowls out for the soup.  They took the cups off the buffet years ago so you couldn't use those and are using styrofoam for the tea.  Shame on you!  Lazy and wasteful.  How many trips am I supposed to make to the buffet for some rasam.  It's ridiculous and thoughtless.  The food is mostly very tasty and well prepared.  My problem lies with the amount of cayenne they put in EVERY dish.  ALL OF THEM.  I eat at hundreds of Indian restaurants all over the country and NONE except Tamarind in the Pittsburgh area are hotter. I would like to slowly enjoy my food not gulp it down quickly.  I like spicy but this is ridiculous.    The service has ranged from rude to ok here and the assortment of buffet items used to better. It's too bad.  I would come here more often.  I was at one of their places and they even made the raita hot.  Clueless.

The winner here was the pulled pork for me.  I liked the vinegar sauce very much.  The pork was juicy and a little smokey and perfect with their sauce.  The smoked veggies and greens were excellent as were the hush puppies that came with my meal.  The ribs were pretty good.  I ordered them dry, not wet.  I liked the rub.  The ribs were a little overcooked and tough on one end and just short of dry.  Their house red sauce was good and was almost a little much when combined with the ribs.  They're ok.  I didn't like the beans.  They're in tomato or something and a little pasty.  Not my taste.  I liked the place and the service was excellent.

Things are looking up in Pittsburgh with the addition of this creative and brilliantly thoughtful restaurant.  This place can be and most likely will be a diet buster but is well worth the splurge every now and again.  I really enjoyed the service and ambiance.  I loved the cushy chairs and could easily have stayed for hours.  Miriam and I split some dishes and each ordered a Caesar salad.  This was a Caesar unlike I have ever experienced and was the best one I have ever had.  From the menu: romaine/ kale / house dressing / crispy pig ears / chicharrones / fried egg / pickled green tomatoes $10.  Oh my gosh.  It was rich and flavorful, the mix of textures was terrific.  The green tomatoes and tangy dressing giving relief to the richness of the chicharrones, pig ears and egg.  I am craving one right now.  We split the buttermilk fried chicken livers with what I believe was a mustard based dipping sauce.  Perfectly battered, fried, the livers were cooked medium.  These were as good as the reviews state and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again and again.  I think there were 8 so I would definitely split them unless your going to make a meal of them at the bar with a drink.  That may just be an idea!    We also split the Ahi Taquitos $14 with ponzu / avocado / jalapenos / ahi amarillo.  Crispy and absolutely wonderful.  I wish they were a little bigger because they were gone in too few bites.  These are very dainty but have huge flavor and a great balance of ingredients.  They're a little on the spicy side but not so much as to be overboard.    Lastly we split the special for the evening.   Braised pork belly with mole, corn on the cob, pickled cabbage, jalapeños and radish.  I loved this.  Loved it!  This should definitely stay on the menu.  The pork was cooked perfectly, it was tender, unctuous fatty dream.  The mole was terrific and I really enjoyed the 4 inch corn on the cobs.  I can't pinpoint the seasoning but I wanted more.    Our 5 dishes were $60 with tax and I really didn't mind a bit.  The quality and brilliance of the food was well worth it and I am excited to give a 5 star review to a Pittsburgh restaurant.  Keep up the good work!  I will be back to try more of this brilliant and interesting menu.

My wife and I have eaten here more than a few times since they've opened.  They went from pretty good to awful.  It's gone downhill to the point where it is easily one of the worst Vietnamese restaurants I have ever eaten at.  The last few times has bordered on inedible.  The owner is stretching himself too thin and opening too many locations.  They do not have a Vietnamese kitchen staff, the waitress told us they are of another country (not Asian), do not speak the language and will not listen to instruction.  It shows in the food, it's erratic, inconsistent and mostly just terrible.  Stick to sushi and drinks and you are probably ok but don't order anything off the menu or you'll be really sorry.  If you drive a bit further to their other restaurant Pho Kim 88, it is much better.  Well, at least I haven't had a bad meal there yet.

Another winner in Pittsburgh?  Could this be truly happening to me?  Creative, interesting AND well executed.  I must be dreaming.  Sorry, I can't resist after years of disappointing food here.  This is a really cool restaurant across from the park in the Regent Square neighborhood.  You can dine inside or out.  The street is way to busy for me so we dined inside.    I ordered the Torrejitas de frijolitos (Alma) $13 Pan-seared black bean patty topped with cilantro-lime cream sauce and served with collard greens, black-eyed pea fritters, plantains, and seasonal vegetables.  Wow!  I loved this dish.  It was spicy without being over the top.  The greens were even highly seasoned and the cumin was an exciting top note.  The plaintains were perfectly cooked, maybe too much sugar added for me but they were delicious.  It came with perfectly grilled asparagus.  I started with the Ensalada sencilla con mango y rucula (Alma) $7 Arugula, ripe mango, almonds, and red onions served with our house-made lime-oregano dressing.  Great salad.  I caught a hint of mint there and it went really well with the mango.  I inhaled it and wished there was a little more when it was gone so quickly.    I can't wait to come back and try some more.  I am not strictly vegetarian but really enjoyed how many options the menu provides everyone here.

Interesting.  Fun.  Inventive.  Intimate.  There's lots of restaurants around the country reinventing dishes and deconstructing others.  This one is about average for the genre for me.  I would come back and try some other dishes because I'm not sure exactly how good this place is yet.    I started with a really good house cocktail.  They make a manhattan that tastes like it met a camp fire.  Smokey and a little sweet.  Very tasty.  I had the brussels sprouts and their version of a cassoulet.  I've had a lot of brussels sprouts these days.  Seems everywhere I do there's a rendition.  These are tasty.  Bacon, a little sweet, a vinaigrette, crunchy, a little rich.  I liked them.  The cassoulet was good, it had some highs and lows for sure.  I liked the chicken hearts and the fried chicken wings but the sausage and pork belly weren't my favorite components.  The sausage was over seasoned for the dish or maybe the wrong seasonings for the dish.  I'm not sure but it bothered me a little.  I am sure I would have liked them in something else.  The pork belly wasn't the unctuous braised melt in your mouth kind I really like.  Cassoulet is always very rich and this one was as well.  I liked the tomato base as it cut the richness and added a bright note.    I ordered the lemon lavender cake and some french press decaf for dessert.  The dessert is excellent.  It comes with a slightly salty pistachio tulle.  Nice!  Decaf is very good.  My wife had a decaf and a cocktail and the total was $125 with a tip. It's a really small restaurant but it wasn't full by any stretch at 7pm on a Friday night.  Still, I would call for a reservation.  We got lucky with parking on Braddock.  I'm not sure where you would park otherwise.

This isn't a question of taste or all the other places I have eaten at that serve this fare.  This is simply a question of food quality and preparation.  I won't even go into the far departure from authentic in this review.  The chips and salsa were inedible.  The chips were stale and oversalted.  The "salsa" tasted like the tomato and chile mixture you get in a can and was too watery to be scooped by a chip.  This was the worst I have been served anywhere.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito.  The flour tortilla was pretty nice.  The filling was mostly chicken and it didn't taste grilled.  Grilled to me is over a flame.  That aside, it was to come with guacamole and there wasn't any in there at all.  I was expecting rice and beans but none there either.  There was a scant amount of pico, lettuce and tomato.  I tried dousing it with the tomatillo salsa but it didn't do much and the other 2 salsas offered were just ground up chiles which I found to be ridiculous.  The lack of effort and interest here was astounding.  There was a lake of some sort of liquid at the bottom of my basket when I was finished.  Was this from the pico?  I can't even believe I had to eat here.  I tried some of my wife's mole and was really super glad I didn't order that dish.  The 2 enchiladas were supposed to come with rice and beans.  She didn't get them so went up to buy a portion of beans.  They looked and tasted as if they had come out of a can.  I ordered a chicken taco after because I was still hungry and desperate to find an edible menu item.  The counter person asked me if I wanted everything.  This included lettuce, tomato, cheese, pico, guac or sour cream.  None of these things should be put on a chicken taco.  I asked her why they didn't come with cilantro and onions as they should and she said that the locals would rather have the other ingredients and offered to send it out as I pleased.  This was nice but telling.  The taco would have been average but the tortillas were terrible and oil soaked and again the same grilled chicken was uninspired at best.    Go try Vicky's Mexican Restauant, come back here and tell me you're still a fan or that you think it's as good as it gets.  The only place worse than this is Jose and Tony's.  Oh and by the way owners, turn off the TV, I don't need to listen to the news while suffering through your food.

This was my second trip to this newer Indian restaurant in the Day's Inn on Banksville.  The first time was ok, everything was swimming in oil but the flavors were pretty good and I liked the variety on the buffet.  This time was terrible.  The only Indian meal I have had that was worse was the one I had in this same space with the previous owners.  From top to bottom the dishes lacked depth of flavor and were lacking in some way or another.  The naan was buried in garlic powder and was inedible.  The gulab is served cold and was mushy.  The saag had poor consistancy and flavor.  The channa was cooked improperly and didn't taste good.  Everything was buried in cayenne to the extreme and it was inedible.  The pakora was good and I ate some tandoor because I was hungry.  I like some heat.    I like the heat you build with fresh and dried chiles.  I do not appreciate the sharp and flavorless heat you get when you dump a bunch of cayenne in a dish.  Mintt and Tamarind do the same ridiculous thing to some of their dishes but the difference is that their dishes have great flavors underneath.  Skip this one and go to Namaste down the street.

I wanted desperately to love this little place.  The vibe is awesome, the menu is cool and I love the cuisine.  Here's the thing, nothing was aok besides the beans.  The black beans were good.  I ordered the jerk chicken taco and the cochinita pibil pulled pork taco.  They came with a side of green and red salsa.  Nothing was aok about any of this.  The jerk chicken was kind of grey and didn't have any jerk flavors, it was topped by unripened mango.  It was supposed to be a fresh mango salsa I guess but the flavors didn't mesh and it was just awful.  I tried it with the salsas but couldn't recommend either of these insipid and flavorless imposters.  Were they sitting around too long and did everything need salt?  There was too much wrong with all of it to sort it out.  The pork was ok, there wasn't enough of it.  Neither salsa really complimented it.  It was swallowed by the flavorful double corn tortilla that housed both tacos.  These were obviously made locally and fresh but were heavier than I am used to.  I can't recommend eating here and I will not be back.  Can I go back to Chicago now?  Mexico City downtown was the bomb and I wish they hadn't closed because this was the real deal.  Even if this isn't supposed to be authentic, they still need someone who understands food preparation and this particular cuisine.  Only my warm heart kept me from hitting the 1 star key.

Very cool place.  The kind of place that is sorely lacking in Pittsburgh and it's pretty good for Pittsburgh too.  There were some highlights and some misses but I had a good time and I think you should check this place out.  My wife and I showed up for an anniversary dinner and really enjoyed ourselves.    I ordered a 1/2 bread and butter. Bblack olive focaccia, whipped lard, EVOO, roasted garlic, preserve citrus, capers, fried rosemary.  I loved the little salad and the whipped lard.  The focaccia is ok.  I ordered this to accompany the porcini and roasted onion soup with fried egg, Beemster, marcona almond, cocoa nib.  All I tasted was porcini.  It comes out with the onion soup and the pour in the porcini portion.  I would pass.  It's rich and like I said it just tastes like porcini and isn't really interesting.    For an entree, I ordered the heritage farm chicken breast and leg confit, black olive caramel, artichoke barigoule, blistered grapes, terragon, crispy ham & parmesan chips.  Way too many flavor components.  The chicken was great and I really liked the olive caramel and artichoke.  The artichoke is delicate and doesn't stand up to the parmesan, crispy ham AND the olive caramel.  Less is more.  You don't have to try this hard and it really detracted overall.  I really liked the chicken and the confit leg.  Delicious.  The parmesan chip was not crispy and I think this is the thing I would have left off.  I would come back again and try more.  The bar is great and I liked my old fashioned.  Please muddle as it should be next time for me.  Thanks.

I had put off trying this restaurant due to the mixed reviews and the doubtful possibility there was quality BBQ in Pittsburgh having been so badly disapointed repeatedly.  I ordered 1/4 pound pork, 1/4 pound ribs and greens.  1/4 pound ribs were 2 bones, very small but very meaty.  I will say that this is the most expensive BBQ I have ever had anywhere in the country without a doubt.    The ribs and pork have a nice dry rub.  BBQ is never spicy and this isn't either, thankfully.  It doesn't come out sauced, another blessing.  The sauce on the table is nice and complements the rub.  It's a little fruity and tangy breaking up the richness of the pork.  Please watch the char.  Burnt isn't good food.  Seriously!  The pork was succulent, there was lots of fat melting in my mouth and making me wish there was more.  I got the end piece of the rib rack but it was still fairly moist.  I wish there was more but I was already at $15 so I wasn't going to order anything else for lunch.  The greens were spot on.  Very nicely done and the portion size (for the greens) was ok.   The place isn't much to look at.  The service was friendly.  I don't know if it's ever going to be 5 stars for me but I will definitely be back to try it again.  I went back!  Took Miriam just a few days later and it was exactly the same.  A good sign.  This time, in addition, I tried the brussel sprouts and they were delicious.  Bring a friend or 3.  If you order more food, the price gets cheaper.  So a 1/2 pound is less than  2 portions of a 1/4 pound for example and you can save money if you share.  It's still expensive but you can do a bit better with some planning.

Absolutely won't be back. This is one of the worst Indian "restaurants" I have ever been to. I eat a lot of this cuisine across the country and this was an effrontery.  The navrattan korma was frozen vegetables in Velveeta cheese sauce. I'm disgusted. It was even the same color.   These people should not be trusted to cook for you. They have air fresheners on the walls spurting chemicals at you while you eat!  I asked about it and the guy said it was to cover up the bad smells!  I asked what bad smell and didn't get an answer. It should smell like delicious Indian food not whatever was loaded in these units.   I heard they're owned by Mintt and the cakes are made there. I'm wondering what else isn't made here.

I am nearly 50 years old and have had 2 fender benders in my life.  One of them was here.  A guy in a van backed into me trying to get away from someone pulling out of a space.  It's not just that the lot is terrible but the drivers around here are awful.  I come here all the time to eat at Namaste or I wouldn't come anywhere near this nightmare of a strip mall.  What a shame.  More poor Pittsburgh area zoning and design.  Too few parking spaces allotted for the business plan and a poorly designed and graded lot.

I almost hit 5 stars but hate to do this for a single visit.  I will be back very soon to try something else.  I ordered the bun with chicken and fried spring roll.  Everything was perfect.  The noodles were soft and delicious, the chicken marinade was awesome, the sauce was a little sweet and spicy and fishy and yummy and yes!  I'm used to a little pile of peanuts and a lime to squeeze but this isn't really necessary.  I caught some cilantro... more is better for me because I love it.  This is a tiny place so I can imagine showing up and not getting a table.  The service was very good and the prices were ok for Squirrel Hill.  Maybe a little high for the cuisine.  Can't wait to try some more.  It could end up being my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the 'Burgh.

This is the best Indian buffet in Pittsburgh. The assortment of choices is unbelievable and it's impossible to try everything. My only small comment is that everything is richer than it has to be. I've had similar examples elsewhere that aren't as heavy. I also appreciate how balanced the heat level is on all of their dishes. There's a definite range. Tamarind, for example, is just hot.  Every dish is too hot. Not here. Another remarkable thing about their food is their use of fresh vegetables in many of their dishes. You rarely see such an abundant variety of freshly prepared vegetables.  Back off the fats a little and I would be here all the time.  There's too many cream and cheese based dishes with fried veg balls floating in them.

I was really excited to see what this place would be about when I passed by it every other day as it was being constructed.  I went opening day even though I knew it was going to be a scene.  Whoever approved this site made a huge mistake as the parking is entirely inadequate and the location is a challenge to exit.  There were better choices in the area for this location and I think they will suffer especially after the Wegman's and Whole Foods open in the area.    I really appreciated the quality of the food within.  They have a huge selection of organic groceries.  The other day I even bought a pint of organic figs.  This is the first time I have ever seen them and they were delicious.  The prepared foods look good.  I tried a chicken wing and it was ok.  The dry rub ribs were ok too.  Not great.  I do like the salad bar, although, I tried a prepared corn salad and it wasn't good.  The corn was tough among other problems with the dish.  I did try an outstanding pork sandwich with brie on a housemade roll.  I am so glad to have another option outside Giant Eagle.

I wish I could join the chorus. I really like Meat and Potatoes their other restaurant. Everything was a near miss. It's a cool menu, they have a great bar, the decor is great. Service was ok. Perhaps trying to do too much?  They're opening 2 other restaurants from what I gather. It's a familiar tale.   I tried 3 dishes. The first was a special. Squash soup garnished with duck confit and pickled cranberries as I recall. This was the best of the 3. A bit more duck please as there were just a few shards of overcooked bits. It came out just barely warm.  Maybe they spent too much time garnishing it?  Would have been nicer, hotter.    Next, "Brussels". A bowl of Brussel sprouts in brown butter with a lemon aioli and dill topped with grated cheese. Still a bit nauseous thinking about it. Where was the dill?  The aioli was smeared inside the bowl a bit.  There was barely enough to talk about. They didn't skimp on the butter though. Ugh. It was swimming.    Somewhere around this time my eyes started burning and I thought I would be treated for smoke inhalation from the burning bread in the kitchen.  I imagine the near loaf they serve as under their Cesar salad being torched helplessly under the salamander until no trace of the craftsmanship of the baker remained. Sure enough, my dining companions Cesar bread was burnt.   Lastly, I had the pig wings. Long beans, mango (too little) other veggies, cilantro, glazed and somewhat candied pork. Interesting dish but lacked balance. It was way too sweet just as my wife's peppers were way too salty. Everything missed.

A new Thai restaurant in the South Hills?... and it's good?..... wake me up because I must be dreaming.  I passed by this place a few times before giving it a try tonight.  It used to be a Chinese restaurant not so long ago as I recall.  I ordered based on the reviews and used their automated order system on Yelp.  I was told on pick-up that they'd give me a 10% discount next time if I pick up the phone.    I had the vegetable spring rolls and the panang duck.  Both were excellent.  Truly.  The spring rolls were crisp and not greasy at all.  Nicely seasoned and came with a very good dipping sauce.   Perfect.  The duck was very good.  I loved the panang curry.  I thought it was spicier than medium but these things are subjective.  I would order mild next time.  The portion was very good.  The duck was as tender as I have ever had in this dish.  It melted in your mouth.  I think there was a coating to it or something that didn't really stand up very well in the sauce.  I've had this a few different ways.  Still, I really enjoyed this dish.  I'll be back again soon to try some more menu items and I'll let you know.

Second time around. I ordered red curry chicken. 3/10 spice level. So hot I couldn't eat it. Threw it in the trash. They exceeded my spice expectations last time but not like this. I shared it with them when I placed my order and was still punished. The quality is good here. Perhaps I would order something boring without any heat but right now I'm too offended to think about returning.

I can't say enough positive things about my experience here.  The breads are inspired.  Organic and made without commercial yeast.  The epidemic of people claiming to be gluten sensitive are just not eating bread made the way you're supposed to eat it!  Long slow fermentations of organic whole grains with a natural levain is the only way to eat wheat and rye.  Here's your bakery!  We enjoyed some small bites of cherry tomatoes, cauliflower and a delightful lentil soup.  The menu changes daily with locally sourced and thoughtfully procured produce and ingredients.  This is a must try.    We had roast pork shoulder with a brilliant mozzarella and spinach sandwich.  Nicely herbed and lightly dressed on ciabatta from their wood burning oven.  Delicious.  I would be here all the time if I lived here.  I hope you'll come out and support these folks and spread the word.
