This is the only place I can find my favorite ice cream. I've been coming here for years and I've never once had a problem with this place. I've cream really brings out the kid in us so I would recommend the clown cone, it's really cute and everybody loves it.

This is the last sprint store I will ever go to even if I have to drive out of my way to go somewhere else. The people there are very unprofessional and don't know what their doing. I walked in just to pay a bill and I have all of workers there just looking around talking not wanting to help even tho there's a lot of people here. It took them a while just to let me know there was a machine in the back where I can pay my bill. I went over to pay it and it wouldn't accept my money so I went back in line for some help and I have the guy a 20 and I didn't get any change back he just added it to the account without asking me. Probably because he was too busy making jokes with his buddy. Won't be coming back here!

Don't eat here!!!!! They have horrible service, the food is nasty, and they take forever to make one hamburger.

If you haven't tried this place you had to try it at least once. They have the best ingredients for all their food and some healthy options as well. I love to get the chicken bowl because their burritos are too big and messy. I'd never had a problem with this place and they always give great customer service.

i love this place but not on the weekends. if you want some popular toppings like strawberries I'd suggest going before 5 because they run out on busy nights. its a place worth trying if you haven't already been before and great places to eat around it.

Chipotle:) this place never disappoints me and I always leave happy. They always have fresh food and if I ever have a problem with the way they made my food they don't have a problem redoing it. I've been eating at this location since it first opened and I've never had one problem.
