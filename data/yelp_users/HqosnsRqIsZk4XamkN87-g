Probably my favorite spot in this city to get Gluten Free pizza! They also take into account cross-contamination for us Celiac's, which means I can go out to eat without stressing or worrying over whether I will have a migraine with the hour. Anybody out there with similar dietary constraints can appreciate the significance of that. Besides the pizza, though, they have a pretty wide variety of GF dishes, and my non-Celiac friends and family always seem to find a dish they love, (my mom always gets one of their pastas). I go here once every few weeks, typically. Love it!

Ray made our wedding reception absolutely phenomenal! He timed all of the little special requests perfectly (like me surprising my husband with a groom's cake). He read the group on the dance floor perfectly and because of that, we didn't stop dancing until our time ran out. He even went along with a surprise our friends had for us that called for a certain song. Could not have imagined that night as perfectly as it turned out. Thank you Ray!

Not sure if I should even write a review, since I've never actually been IN this one! BUT, very good Gluten Free pizza! Had it delivered one night after a hellish work shift, and even though it was pricy, definitely hit the spot. Will have to update this when I dine in the specific location sometime.

Heehee, few things make me happier than good GF pizza! Diagnosed Celiac two years ago, and coming from an Italian family has made the transition difficult. This Picazzo's is great! Atmosphere is cozy, yet elegant. Sometimes the service is great, sometimes just good, depends on the day :).   I love the garlic and brie appetizer. Salads are always fresh and full of flavor, (Southwestern is a favorite for me and my mama). The pizza is great. Not the best I've had (BJs still wins that contest), but absolutely wonderful non the less! The chocolate chip pizza cookie is insanely good, but definitely one of those things that make you feel guilty for eating.  This restaurant definitely has the most options for GF eaters than any other I've been to, and takes into account cross-contamination, which is HUGE. I would love to give this place 4.5 stars, because it really is awesome, just not my number one :). Hmmm, now I want pizza.

I have visited this location regularly over the last few years, mostly for lunch but also for dinner. All of the servers are great, but we usually have Brian. He always remembers me and what I like to order as well as asks questions that show thoughtfulness and the desire to build relationships with customers.   I normally get sweet and sour shrimp or chicken, but have also had the pad thai. My absolute favorite here are the spring rolls! They are made with tofu paper (no gluten), so I can have them! My favorite! Everything I've had here is very tasty!

Alright Gluten Free eaters! Though this place was definitely a bit expensive, it had the most amazing gluten free pizza I have tried yet. I so enjoyed eating traditional Italian pizza, free of worry!    As far as gluten free pizza, I give this place five stars. Although, if that were not a consideration, I might be leaning more towards four. Our server was attentive and pleasant. However, as previously mentioned, it was a bit pricy and lacked an ideal atmosphere (granted this could have been because there were few customers in the restaurant).   I would definitely go back, although probably only for more special occasions, and would probably try a Friday or Saturday night for a better atmosphere.

The short version: Dan tried to get out of having to do any work for us, tried to transfer the blame to causes out of the company's control, was condescending and then left quickly without any of the expected/appropriate follow-up measures such as documentation of the call or next steps.   The long version: First, this is the 6th (maybe 7th) time in the last year that we have had to call somebody out to fix our heating/cooling system. Three times throughout last summer... in Phoenix... while I was in the third trimester of a pregnancy. To be fair, the first of those summer calls was with another company. This time, the "heater" was blowing cold air.   The individual who responded to this service call was Dan. He looked at the outsides of both the interior and exterior unit (did not open either) and told me nothing "appeared" to be wrong. (You mean besides the heater cooling my house?)  When I pressed further, he tried to blame it on simply needing to be serviced. I pointed out that his company had "fixed" the problem only 3 months prior and if it needs to be serviced already, there must be something else wrong.   I told him that the unit was technically not big enough for the square footage of our house, he said, "Yeah, it may not be the bestl, but if it's 110 outside, it should be able to keep your house at 80-81." I told him that unfortunately, the low 80s don't really cut it with a baby, and besides, we're talking about heating not cooling.  He then condescendingly proceeded to tell me that my concern for keeping my 8-month old son in a relatively well heated/cooled environment was unfounded. He based this opinion on the fact that millions of children survive around the world in adverse climates despite having heating/AC units. "I mean, in Africa..." I'm sorry, Dan, but thankfully we are not in Africa and while I feel for the poor babies who live in such environments, it does not mean I should be any less concerned for my own child's safety and comfort.   Throughout the last year, I have been forced to learn quite a bit about our unit. I respectfully asked a number of questions to make sure that Dan was being thorough, which apparently intimidated him. He found two parts that he said needed to be replaced, said that the "other guy, Glenn" who we have worked with before, would be back out next week to replace the parts. He left as quickly as he could after mumbling some excuse for why there was no point in looking at the other unit and without leaving me any sort of documentation for the visit.   Finally, he did not clean the coolant off of the concrete that spilled out while he was messing with the valves. I have 3 dogs. Thankfully, I noticed so that I could block the dogs from it, but I would have expected that to be part of being thorough.   I won't even go into detail about the not so aesthetically pleasing job they did previously replacing the internal unit (see picture attached). All that lovely black gunk everywhere should really help our resale value don't ya think?
