This store loves to mess up orders apparently. The first time was a small accident , the kid was new so I gave them a second chance. But tonight was not that case. I called the store to advise my bread bowl pasta  was incorrect but the box label was correct. The ingredients they put in that we're wrong I was allergic to them and The assistant manager Tim said "ok and...?" Ok and... I want it fixed or my money back, neither of what Tim was willing to do. After admitting He made my food incorrectly he proceeded to not replace it he then said that he will only replace my food if I pay a delivery fee and waited an hour. No thanks! Why should I pay for your mistake you admitted too??? After tonight I won't be returning to this store again.

Great service and the waiter was always checking on us never had to look around for service. They use these new computers at your tables to order drinks, food, desserts etc. It was nice being able to press a button and have a drink refill within seconds. You can also pay your bill from the tablet at your table no need to wait for a check and them to return your slip and card to sign. Oh and they hooked it up on chips and salsa to go!!!

Their smoothies and bowls are delish and go great anytime of the day. They also sell quest bars (which are freaking amazing) only downfall is when they are busy you can wait anywhere from 15-30 mins to get your order.

Cute restaurant space but doesnt make up for the staff thats not friendly at all. We waited at the counter for 15 minutes before someone walked in out of nowhere to take our order. The soda was all flat and when we mentioned it to the worker he just stared and walked away. Food was horriable. Our buns for our "bacon burgers" were stale and the veggies were all wilted. I was very disappointed to see a local hole in the wall be so horriable on service and good when we were the only customers at the time.

Unfortunately I haven't had good luck with my car in the last 2 years... fortunately there is Elite to fix it for me... Chris and his staff go the extra mile to make sure they give you the highest quality work and easiest experience even when dealing with insurance companies.. they treat you as a good  friend not just another customer. Both times I was rear ended Elite made sure to get everything little detail about the car fixed back to what looked like it was never damaged, I didn't have to lift a finger, they handled it all for me which was a stress reliever. When it comes to out of pocket repairs Elite is great with working with you on your repairs, making sure you receive their great service with a fair price. Elite really takes pride in all their work and they show it , between their drift cars with custom paint jobs to customers cars that they have put alot of time and money into that mean a lot to them. When you are a car enthusiast like myself quality and great service means alot and Elite always delivers! I will never go else where for body or paint work. I cant wait to see how the deep key marks that are on my doors are gonna come out after Elite works their magic for me once again! I will continue to send my friends and family to elite for all the services they offer.   Check em out! you wont be disappointed!

Awesome concept for pizza. They charge one price for size and you can load it with toppings. Try their raspberry lemonade or carmelized pear tea. There is always a line but totally worth the wait. Friendly staff. Just wish they had different crust besides paper-thin . Sometimes I like a good thick crust.

Just tried this place and it was soooo good. I'm super picky about burgers because any one can make a burger but to have flavor and good meat is the challenge ... This place passes my test! Blows Smash Burger out of the water. The Thai ketchup and toasted marshmallow for fries was delicious. I'll be back soon.

This place is amazing. Everyone needs to try it at least twice! !  So many places sell the typical frozen yogurt but to add a waffle, every topping and syrup you can think of is a crazy thought ! I never would have thought they sold such a awesome dessert until i tried YoWaffle.    Pretty sure I died and went to heaven and came back with every bite. Moving from Tempe where I was walking distance from Yogurtland, I can say I won't be deprived of yogurt now that I found this gem and think I'm gonna be breaking up with Yogurtland for yowaffle.   The concept is simple and easy to follow and the waffles are to die for. Lots of family's and a great place for kids. Friendly staff, super good flavors and thoes waffles... taste like a doughnut on steroids.

If i could give this place negative stars I would.  We have been going to Taharu for years at the Tempe location and never had issues. Apperantly this must be the red headed step child because the service is bad... Walked in when it was dead at 2 pm it's 314 pm and still don't have my order that I placed. I flagged down the server to have her tell me she doesn't know what happened to my order but if I want I can pull from the bar I could do so. The whole point of using the order form was because what I wanted wasn't on the bar.  No refills on drinks even after asking,  Horrible service. If I come back it will be the Tempe location since they don't leave you hanging for an hour and then loose your order.

Really cool modern coffee house that opened in Tempe . "hispter hangout". A neat place to hangout and relax. I love the design and decor. Staff was very friendly.     The Royal milk tea was delicious and they had a wide selection of drinks, everything is freshly made and delivered to your table. All the pastries looks super good also.  We tried the mango snow since we are HUGE snow fans/critic's . The snow was good, had lots of flavor and color but it not textured like the tridational tawainess shaved ice. But worth another try.  Will come back to try their pastries and a different drink.
