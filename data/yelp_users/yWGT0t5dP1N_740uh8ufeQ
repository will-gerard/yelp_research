Love them, been a member since 1997 when they were Motorola Employees Credit Union West.  I recently bought a new home.  I worked with Kelley Birt on my mortgage, and she was great.  Got me approved and through underwriting in less than 3 weeks, she probably could have done it faster if we needed her to.  Highly recommend the very personal and professional experience they offer.

After paying for my entire landscaping project (final check written 9/1/15), I still can't get things fixed.  Basic Malibu lights are  broken and not functioning, it worked for exactly 2 days after I wrote my final check.  We've since notice they planted  mismatched vines on one wall, and we have a dead plant that is not replaced.  Gary can't stand behind his warranty or his work.  If you want excuses, he is your man.  If you want a beautiful yard where everything you paid for works, look elsewhere.  Update 11/2/15 - Gary called today with more excuses.  I countered with a timeline for everything to be fixed.  Will let yelpers know the outcome.  Update 12/3/2015 - someone showed up, replaced the transformer and the dead plant.  When replacing the transformer they didn't rewire my front lights.  The system no longer trips, This points to the fact that my front lights may have had the short, not my back, which is good.  But why Zona Works didn't know that is beyond me.  I also received a very interesting set of letters from Gary, (wish I could post them here) which again were packed full of excuses and things that never happened, were never said, nor never communicated to anyone.  In the letter he refers to me as a "Jerk Off" blaming him.  Well yes, this is correct, he was the general contractor, I do hold him accountable for the work and his crew.

Good stuff, local, good food!  Awesome place for happy hour and a great staff.  It does get a little loud, but hey it's a brewery!

We started with one of Taz's cooking classes, and have quickly moved to calling this the best Indian restaurant in AZ.  The korma is pretty amazing.  Saag so fresh you feel like the spinach was just picked!  It's small and quaint but oh so worth it!

I have eaten here before love it.  We brought a medium size party in with dietary restrictions.  We had the pleasure of Jamar waiting in us.  He told us to put away our menus and he would take us on a journey!  He did just that.  When our kids food came out too spicy he had her exactly what she wanted in 3 minutes.  He did an amazing job, one of my all time best waiters.  Go, ask for Jamar, even if you don't get him, you will have some of the best food in Old Town!

Pomegranate never disappoints.  Get onto the vegan and raw vegan deserts.  Pomegranate cake will blow your mind.  And the Almond Joys are awesome.  You'll never know they are almost healthy!

Very pleased with these guys.  We had some issues on our close and move date, Terry was very accommodating on our date mix ups.    Leonard and one other gentleman (I don't recall his name (Alex?), but also extremely pleasant) showed up on time, and promptly started loading.  We moved an entire house from one place to another (not just a few boxes!).  It was a long day for them, and they knocked it out of the park.  My biggest concern was my full sized gun safe, they moved it out and in no problem!  I even had a motorcycle with a dead battery, no problem, they loaded it up and transported it.  I have to say many companies are out there with prices all over the board, these guys are the most reasonably priced, and did a great job.  No breakage, quick, and nice guys!  You won't go wrong with them!  Call Terry, and book them today.

Wow!  What a horrible experience!  Work happy hour 10 people, 20 minutes to get a few of the people's drinks, we had to ask the waitress for the rest of the drinks, then had to go to the bartender to finally get them.  They told us it would be $3 a plate to split appetizers, really appetizers!  Food came out very sporadically and getting another drink was a joke.  I give them two stars because the food is decent......

Not to clean.  Everything tasted like fish, a bit odd.

Nitrogenated cold brew coffee floats...do I need to say any more!  Pretty cool vibe, very fun place to sit back and enjoy your coffee!

Love Craft 64!  All local beer and all local ingredients.  The Spain pizza is something new and different and well worth trying.  We've also had the breakfast pizza, which was one of the best breakfast I've had in a long time!  Plus you get to chat with James and have him pair up the best of what AZ offers by way of beer!  You gotta try this place!
