Food was ok.  Small servings.  Half of my order was not completed.   Customer service SUCKS.

We were turned away and told the soonest they could get us in was the next day.   What a way to treat a customer.  The hostess was rude.  We were told that they have big parties and we couldn't be accommodated.   On a Saturday!  I feel bad for the owner.  Probably has NO clue his staff is costing him business.  At least make a customer feel like you are trying to accommodate them.

Mariee Bridal is an absolute gold mine when it comes to bridal fashion and impeccable customer service!  I had some bad experiences when searching for my wedding dress and was bullied and almost forced into buying a dress that I didn't want.  James and Carrie are customer service at its finest and have made all of my wedding dress dreams come true!  Thank you so much for allowing me to come in and take my time in my decision making process.  You all truly understand the beauty of the process and are not out to just sell a dress!
