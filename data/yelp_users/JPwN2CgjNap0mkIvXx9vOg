First of all, I must say Sushi is my favorite food. I have tried not all but most Japanese restaurant in town. This would be the best of all among others, although it might not be perfect each time but their food is fairly consistent.   Fish is fresh, the rice cooked just right. Place is a bit small but they are usually not that busy.  I will vote this best of Japanese restaurant in town and I will recommend everyone to try at least once.

Food comes out slow. Long wait line, just don't come here during busy hours. Food is good but not sure if it's worth the wait.

I will not recommend Chas Roberts to anyone. My new house has two AC units that were installed by Chas Roberts. One of the unit has small freon leak since day one, it leaks about a lb of freon every year, by the time I noticed the leak which was 2 years later, the warranty from Chas Roberts had expired. I had them came out three times in the pass 6 years to refill total of about 10 lbs freon. I called and expressed my concern that unit was defected since day one, they would care less.

If Yelp allows 10 stars, I will give Dr Moretsky 20 stars.  Back in 2005, me and my wife were getting married and preparing our wedding. It was just a week before our wedding, my wife was trying different makeups/fake eyelashes in a salon, at the end of that night, she had to remove all those fake eyelashes with eye makeup remover. It was not easy to take them off but eventually she got them all off.   We then went to sleep and that's when our nightmare about to start.   Around 3 am Saturday morning, my wife wake up scramming, both of her eyes were burning like crazy and she couldn't even open to see anything. I honestly didn't know what to do at that point, I was about to call 911 but as soon as I claim down, I remember Dr Moretsky does Lasik Surgery on Sat early morning since both of us had Lasik Surgery done by Dr Moretsky few years prior to that.   With no appointment, no phone call, we arrived at their office early 7 am. We walked into the office and explained the situation to them. The staffs were very nice and informed Dr Moretsky the situation. We were then told Dr Moretsky will see us but we need to wait couple hours until he finished his surgery for that morning. We had no problem waiting and was so glad he was coming to check out my wife's eyes.  Couple hours passed, Dr Moretsky checked my wife's eyes and told us her eyes were scratched up by the eye makeup remover, she won't go blind. With some treatments and covered them up couple days, she was able to see again!  I was so happy and relief.   My wife and I had our wedding as scheduled a week later and we really really appreciated Dr Moretsky's help.

Fred tuned our piano recently. The piano has not been tuned for many years, since I am not a musical professional, so I had no idea how off the tunes were. Once he was all done, I used my Seiko STH100 Metronome/Tuner to check and 95% of the keys are right at the spot. Rest of 5% are extremely close and that would be my cheap $25 device margin error.   Fred is a very nice personal with a heart of a teacher, showed me how to clean the piano inside. Will use again.

As seen on TV, their food is wacky but tasty! Mexican mixed with Chinese, very interesting and a lot of creative food. While this is not a gourmet restaurant, it is worth a try.  Their Chandler location is hard to find, behind Walgreen and you can barely see it from the main streets.

There are so many Chinese Buffet restaurants in town, they all come and go, keep changing owners, etc. This place is the only Chinese buffet restaurant that got better and better over time.   They do have large selections of tasty food and not boring like other Chinese buffet restaurants. Overall quality is good and they do keep it up.  Do stay away from the raw oysters, just too risky. They don't have the best sushi but fairly decent as far as buffet place goes.  Prices have gone up and its not cheap.  Overall, I do vote this place "Best of Chinese Buffet Restaurant" in town.

Okay, a lot of reviews on this place so I will get right to the points.  Pros: 1. One of the best American Grill style restaurants you can find in town, maybe the best. 2. Great atmosphere, sitting outside is nice when its not hot. 3. Food is very fresh. 4. Food comes out quick once its ordered  Cons: 1. Long lines, expect long wait just to order when its busy. 2. Not the cleanest restaurant that I have been to, I can see its hard to keep all tables/chairs clean when they have so many customers. 3. Possible long line to fill up the drinks 4. Only two family restrooms, line again!  Bottom line, I do recommend this restaurant to everyone, must pick a not so busy time.

I will not use First Impression again, we purchased a gate door and a front screen door from them. The workmanship appeared good when new, but they had the wrong type of lock that I needed, asked them to change it and they want extra money for it. We paid for it and they wanted the old lock back, I told the guy we paid extra for the new lock and he can't have it.   Rust at bottom started to show after 3 years, I know powder coating is not rust free but they should not rust this quick.   They were also the most expensive vendor out there when we were shopping around.

I am not a fan of red lobster, but once a long while we still go there if they have something new like the endless shrimp. So we went and its again a disappointment. Too much butter, too much salt. Dishes are way too salty. Service way okay, not great but acceptable.   That's probably going to be my last time ever visited Red Lobster.

I honestly don't know why this place got 5 stars. We drove all the way out there to try this 5 stars buffet and we were so disappointed. Did they change chefs or other reviewers had taste buds problem? (Sorry, no offense here)  Food is like fast food restaurant quality, maybe slightly better at most. You might be able to find something okay to eat there but the bad things we noticed just really annoyed us.   They have a grill section and you can see this large container on the table holding all the raw chicken, raw salmon waiting to be cooked. Well, they need to cover up the container while the food were waiting to be cooked and kept under 41 degree F.  Grilled chicken on the stick, looked like they been sitting there all dry up before they were grilled, so they just looked raw outside but fully cooked inside, looked just like what I saw at the "body worlds exhibit", ouch!  We also noticed there are quite a few flies flying around in the restaurant even they have those bug lights.  If you were gambling there and the casino gives you free meal at this place, I say sure why not, but otherwise, its just not worth it.   As a side note, we went to get the players cards and save $3 per person. First timer also get $20 free credit to pay. Me and my wife won $11 of out of those $40 free credit which save us 50% on this meal.

After my bad experience with the other dental place, I am so glad I found them. I have nothing but good things to say about them. Been using them for 4 years, very happy with their services.

My spring broke again in just 4 years and need replacement. Called couple places from yelp. A1 seems to have best response. When I first called, I first felt little uncomfortable when they told me that they can only give me the price quote after having the tech come out and look at it. But it was a simple spring replacement as I told them, so the lady at the end told me about $225 + tax. Well, that was a bit on the high side  so I told them I will let them know later.  10 minutes later, I got a call from them and told me that if I can give them little bit more detail of my garage door spec, he can give me a better quote over the phone. I was then told $185 + tax for dual springs. So I gave them an okay and two hours later the tech showed up and he was very friendly.  Within 30 minutes, it was all done and I was happy. Will use them again.

Beautiful Decor but the food is below average. Don't expect too much except a great looking place.

** PRICE INCREASE AFTER STARTING THE JOB; THREATEN TO TAKE MATTERS TO COURT IF NEW PRICE NOT PAID **  We have a rental move out and decided to give Marie a try. She showed up on time to meet at the property and gave me a quote of $200. I agreed on the price and told her Friday would be the best day to come. Thursday she texted me and gave me a time window to show up.   Friday came as soon as she arrived at the property, she started texting me pictures of the dust in the house claiming it was way too dirty and demanded more money. Its the same property she checked few days ago, and nothing has changed!  I was at work didn't read the texts until later and without my consent, she continued to clean the place. Then I got stuck at work couldn't show up at the property. I sent my elderly parents there and that was a mistake, she got really mean and threaten them to take matters to court if not paid. I should have called the police there at the beginning.   Keep in mind I am not in disagreement with her about the dirtiness of the place. I am in total disagreement of price change after she started cleaning the house, she could have told me price may change after its cleaned.  Sure she got $50 more but this will be a big loss for her long run. I manage dozens of rental properties and use cleaning companies more than average person.  Will never do business with her again!

The "Sweet Tomatoes" that we love for years is sadly gone. The Field Kitchen is truly a disappointment. It is more expensive, not sure if I can say taste better, just taste different. And where is my must have wonton chicken salad!!?? Its gone! Chicken noodle soup is not the same!   Sweet Tomatoes, we go to the old "Sweet Tomatoes" on a weekly basis for many years, and if you care big fan customer like me. Please don't remodel the rest of your locations, cuz I will not go to Field Kitchen!

If you have high expectation like me, you will be disappointed. I went there because I want to try the ramen noodles, but their "tonkotsu" is not tonkotsu at all, not even close. It tastes like some sort of Chinese style pork soup.   Whoever making this "tonkotsu" should at least go to Sushi Ken or Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe to see what "tonkotsu" is like. Or better yet, go to the Ramen Museum in Yokohama, Japan to see the real deal.  On the plus side, the ramen texture is good, very hot when served.   I will not return to this place.

Went there yesterday but found out that the restaurant has sold to another owner. I hope new owner can make it even better. They were closed yesterday and don't know when they will open again under new management.

I got so excited when I found out this restaurant was opened. It is beautiful inside with modern design. But the food was a huge disappointment. :(  Boba milk tea - Lack of tea favor, not sweet enough, lack of milk as well. Boba is hard. Ramen Noodle - The broth is not hot enough, adding the raw and cold bean sprouts make the whole bowl even colder. Very very salty, tasted like soy sauce mixed with a bit of water.   Gyoza - This is deep fried "pai wei" style, authentic Japanese style is no where like this.   Good chef is not easy to hire and I always wonder if restaurant owners aware what their food tasted like. I wish they could make something taste better.
