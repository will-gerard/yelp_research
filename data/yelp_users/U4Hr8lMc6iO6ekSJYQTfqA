I've been coming to PoPos for 40+ years and usually love it here BUT this past Tuesday will be my final visit. 99 cent Margaritas no longer exist unless you can meet all the requirements and guidelines they've mandated. So ridiculous! We 3 gals each ordered $8.50 appetizers. Ate one there & 2 to go! Appetizers & orders to-go don't qualify as a meal so 6 Margaritas were billed at $3.25 not .99 cents. Waitress & Manager want to argue and make a scene instead of resolving. They've gotten so greedy here.   We gathered to celebrate my birthday and asked for the Bday fried ice cream 3 times and it never came. Such a bummer. Thanks for the memories and good food PoPos.  We will have to find another place now.   Pass along any recommendations for good Mexican food with great yet affordable Margaritas! We need a "re-do!"

Our group had a fabulous time at Ah So Goodyear. Food was delicious and quick. Drink specials were on point and the overall vibe of the place was very welcoming. Manager is a class act too - can't remember his name.
