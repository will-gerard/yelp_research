We are a straight couple and we loved Charlie's.  I (female half) love going to drag shows and have seen Barbra Seville (hilarious) and Angela Dodd (Hot as hell) many times so that was the big reason we decided to try it out on a Sunday night. I was so not ready for what I encountered! Packed full with lots of very attractive people.  It was reminiscent of P-town in mid summer.  For those of you who are not East Coast people, you need to go there also.  :) Charlie's was a big fun party, slammed full of very friendly, very good looking people having a great time.  I had a blast.  The only thing I was hoping for that didn't occur was an interactive drag show.  I guess I will have to head out to one of the less crowed spots to enjoy this type of entertainment. Kudos!

So, as a complete NON veg, I was dragged there by my girl who is a veggie.  I was dubious, as I am a total steak man.  I must say that the steak poboy was so good, I ordered 2 with extra meat in each.  I was actually craving them a few days later.  Better than a regular steak and cheese sub as you don't feel like crap after you eat it. lol I hate it when she is right.

Excellent people! Very caring.  Grackle nestling in my backyard, couldn't get up.  I have dogs, cats, and a pool, so it is a death trap for baby birds.  Happily, I drove him up to Liberty and they took him in right away.  They also guaranteed that they would help to get him strong and able to live on his own.  So thankful for this place and the people there!

Giovanni does excellent work.  We wanted to retain the couch and high back chair we had purchased in 1996 because we love the style, but the fabric was sorely outdated.  Giovanni took the time to come to our house and show fabric, wood fixtures, and discuss all options with us.  His work is stellar.  He is prompt and very polite.  Highly recommended if you are looking to fix up and update!

Had my birthday dinner here as I'm a big steak fan.  My girl is a vegetarian so even though this is for my birthday, it sure is helpful to have some palatable options for her.  I'll make this review shorter than normal because nothing more need be said.  The food was excellent, the service was excellent, they even had tasty options for the veggie.  In addition, everyone has a crazy friend.  Well, one of mine showed up and made an idiot out of herself and the staff handled it excellently (next year we won't tell her where we're going though).  Highly recommended.

OMG.  Terrible experience here.  We expected a lot because it's a beautiful country club.  Our evening started by walking into a mostly empty restaurant and standing at an empty host desk for 5 minutes.  The hostess then swung by to tell us it would be 10 minutes before they could seat us.  We went to the bar and ordered a couple drinks and an appetizer (cheese plate).  The drinks came quickly but the appetizer did not.  15 minutes later we were seated in the dining room (only 2 other tables had people there).  It's worth noting that the hostess actually stopped to talk to people as she lead us to our seats, for at least a minute or two, both of us standing awkwardly waiting for her to finish her conversation and show us where to sit.  Shockingly unprofessional.  Our waiter came over quickly and was unaware that we were still waiting for the cheese plate.  He took our orders (she wanted a salad, I just got a burger) and disappeared.  No bread was offered to us.  The cheese plate eventually made its' way to our table with 3 slices of bread and approximately 19 billion pieces of meat & cheese.  Still no bread or biscuits offered to us even though other tables had them.  Her salad arrived without dressing, along with my burger.  The waiter did not come back to check on us.  Near 15 minutes passed before I could flag one down and ask them to get her dressing; by this time I was done with my dinner.  At this point they asked if we wanted bread.  Another 10 minutes later the bread and her salad dressing came out.  Our drinks were empty for this duration as well.  What a cluster.  To add insult to the experience, 18% gratuity was added automatically to the bill.  We spoke the manager about the experience and he apologized about our experience, and justified the long wait to seat us despite the empty restaurant saying that they had a backup in the kitchen and didn't want us to be seated and wonder why we weren't being served food quickly.  Well, we wondered anyway.  We could have been seated and at least had bread & drinks instead of being treated like second class citizens waiting at the bar while the restaurant remained empty.  The food was marginal.  The burger is not a complicated culinary endeavor, but managed to taste like a (nice) mass produced frozen patty.  The fries were terrible.  Her salad was okay, but truthfully the food could have been perfect and we'd still be upset as the service was deplorable.  The manager asked us to come back for a second chance.  We may do it and if our experience is better we'll update this.  On the other hand, neither one of us are particularly excited to go back.  As of now, not recommended.

Second chance at bolero's. After receiving a phone call from one of the managers regarding our visit in April, we decided to try again.  We were told they would make things right and they were very apologetic for the horrible evening we had.  (We were so irritated with the place, we waited 4 months to take him up on the offer) As an aside, we were told we would be comped dinner due to the previous disaster.  I called ahead and spoke to Jason, who does not work at Bolero's any longer, but stated that since he was the manager at the time the incident occurred, he would make sure the new manager was aware that they needed to adhere to his promise to make things right.  Was told to call manager Desi, but no one answered.  Proceeded to the restaurant and hoped for the best.    When we got there, as before, we stood at the front desk for between 5 and 10 minutes before anyone came to seat us.  Not a promising start.  Luckily though, that's where the lame service ended.  We had Gage as a server and he did a terrific job.  He was attentive, stopped by to fill our drinks often, checked to make sure our food was good, brought things out all at the same time, and was pleasant to deal with.    We started with the cheese plate and it was, as before, good although probably could use some more bread with it as there are a ton of meats and cheeses and 4 small pieces of bread.  As far as the food goes, she had the spinach salad, and I had the reuben with onion rings.  Both dishes were well prepared and tasty.  We asked for a basket of bread, which was brought out with dinner.  The bread was great, but they maybe ought to consider bringing it out early, maybe just asking people if they'd like bread with their meal.  Just a suggestion.  Our only other concern as far as the menu goes is that there are not a lot of vegetarian offerings that aren't salad.    Overall, it was a much better experience.  As we said before, Gage did a great job, and even though Jason is no longer the manager there, Dave (who was standing in for Desi, from what we were told) took care of everything.  They put effort into making this experience much better and they did a good job.  We both appreciated it and we'd go back.  There it is, an updated review.  Bolero's is in a beautiful location and now we can say the service & food are worth a visit.

Tremendous!  My girl is a vegetarian, and it is always a super thrill to find a location that does veggie dishes well and uniquely.  Tried 2 of the special veggie pasties with the quorn meat substitute. HOLY COW! So good! So excited to find a place as cute as this is and as funky cool.  They have a patio right outside and very eclectic decor.  I can't wait to try some of the other items on the menu.   The location used to house a little family owned italian restaurant, so this was a welcomed change to a location that needed some updating.   And they are open until 12am for all you late night people that want different food.  Excellent work to the proprietors!

We visited this restaurant off the cuff, we happened to see it as we were driving by.  We were seated outside on the lovely patio.  Our server, Jesse, was gregarious and cordial and helped set the experience off to a wonderful start, explaining the tapas, dishes, and deserts with enthusiasm and excellent knowledge.    We started with 3 of the appetizers that were vegetarian (she is vegetarian, I am not), and a cheese plate.  For our main course she had the tomato soup and I had the skirt steak.  The tapas were excellent, no two ways about it.  The cheese plate was good, the pear jam a nice touch and balancing everything well.    She wasn't a big fan of the soup as it was very rich, dark, maybe a little towards paste.  I had the skirt steak which was ridiculously good.  The fries were also great.  Dessert... I had a cup of coffee (great) and the peanut butter/chocolate special.  She had the apple crisp/sandwhich thing which was highly recommended by Jesse.  I have to give the nod to the apple desert, it was near perfect.  The peanut butter/chocolate concoction was also good, although a bit rich for me, and slighly spoiled by me tasting how damn good the apple desert was.  The service was great.  Jesse made the night.  He was entertaining, helpful, and we had a nice (brief) conversation prior to leaving.  Good service helps.  Reading some of the reviews it appears that others haven't had the same experience; I guess maybe it was luck of the draw for us, but we'll definitely come back.

We attended the Elvis Impersonators Show on Aug 17, 2013. So many bad things about this place...don't know where to begin.    First, it was a sold out show so you think they would have the AC on full blast (107 degrees outside).  Nope! Was stuffy and warm.  So much so, the performers were dripping and complaining it was hot.  Second, the sound quality in this venue is horrendous.  It is a squarish box, so the acoustics are far from ideal!  The sound men obviously have no clue how to try to rectify the situation... we were sitting in the back left quadrant from the stage, and the vocals were completely inaudible.  Half way through the show the entire rear part of the audience had left because the sound was so bad.  People were yelling "We can't hear you!" but it was to no avail.  My girl actually became physically ill during the second act of the concert.  Not sure if it was a combination of the heat and poor sound quality.  Now to address the Elvis show.  You would think that impersonators would attempt to make a show as interesting as possible to a wide spectrum of people.  Older people brought their children and grandchildren to this show!  The music should be songs people recognize, not an hour and a half of songs from 1968 that no one knows.  There seemed to be little to no coordination with the other impersonators!  There were three and each one did repeats of songs that the other ones had already done. (We heard Blue suede shoes & Hound Dog waaay too many times) Terribly planned for an audience to experience.  Seriously, we waited for Viva Las Vegas and Burning Love and neither were performed.  I understand that the impersonator doing the "Back to Hawaii" Elvis was attempting to do (most of) the actually televised show, but come on, no one remembers any of that crap he sang...do his most famous songs for the audience that came out to see you!    Needless to say, we left half way through the third performer.  Too bad because I love Elvis and have gone to see Viva Elvis in Vegas 4 times.

Update:  Came back in Sept of 2014 and the food was better, the service was good, and they seem to be on their way to success.  The place was still pretty empty -maybe the time of night/weeknight we went, but it was a much better experience.  Still a little room to grow but on the right path.

Went here for lunch Sun 4/17/16.  The atmosphere was good, trendy, seemed like it had good potential.  The food is a little pricey but not totally unreasonable.  Waitstaff was attentive.  So why just 1 star?  Cleanliness.  We were oriented in such a way in our seats as to watch the ordering counter/kitchen, which is open and visible to patrons.  I personally observed the manager, cleaning things up, touching all sorts of things, then using his BARE HANDS to re-appropriate some french fry's from one plate to another.  The kitchen staff were all using gloves -no issue there.  Then not a minute later we saw the waitstaff wipe her nose on her hand right before picking up a plate to go serve to someone who luckily didn't see what we saw.    This is a HUGE turnoff.    The place has potential -good location near to us, good vibe with the bar and outside seating but come ON guys, no dirty bare hand touching food.  Not acceptable.  If we hadn't seen the disrespectful lack of cleanliness, we'd probably have rated it between 3 and 4 stars -food was decent and like I said, I could see the vibe there being very positive.  Wash your hands and use gloves, this isn't supposed to be amateur hour.  Unacceptable.
