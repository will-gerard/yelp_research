I had surgery here in the outpatient ward and it was fantastic.  The nurses were great - they were friendly, they talked with me and my family and were really warm and cozy.  In the recovery area they had this great warm air bubble thing around me and they never rushed me to get up and moving.  They made it a really great and easy experience.

Great staff, great prices. The guy that did the actual sonogram was so sweet and engaged my family. He took time to answer my kids questions. He took time to move me around to get the best pictures. And they give you a great little goodie bag at the end!

The doctors here are amazing, but the office staff is going to stop me from continuing to bring my children back.  Since my daughter was born in September, I've had them mess up an appointment 3 times.  As in, I show up and it ends up being a completely different day.  The first time I thought maybe I had done something wrong, the 2nd time my husband did it so I assumed it was him (ha) and now that it's happened a third time I am sure that they are just messing it up.  I had a clear conversation with them last Wednesday that I needed an appointment as soon as possible, they didn't have anything for last week so she was going to look "next week" (this week).  She found an appointment on Monday, we said "Great, see you Monday!" and I showed up yesterday just for them to say "Oh, it's NEXT Monday."  This is exactly what has happened each time.  I don't know if there scheduling calendar is complicated or what.  We also had a huge debacle with my daughter and her jaundice levels and follow-up appointments after birth.  They messed up my schedule and then would send me away.  I said specifically on a Tuesday, "She has to come back in 3 days for a follow up visit for blood work" and then they scheduled it for the following Friday a week from then.  I found out later that they should have never sent me away because newborns are always supposed to be seen when they come in.  I LOVE the doctors, but as a working mom with 5 kids, I can't have an office staff that is this disorganized and hard to work with.  It's really disappointing!

Food is decent. Service is slow and unresponsive. They brought half our food and then we had to sit and stare at our food over 8 minutes before the other half came. It took three asks to get syrup. The server wrote our order wrong. They have a tight waiting area which feels right on top of people eating.

These ob doctors have completely lost touch with the needs of their patients.  They forget that just because they deliver babies everyday, doesn't mean that this isn't a once in a lifetime event for the patient.  They treated me with annoyance and condescension when I tried to express a different opinion.  They are a c-section practice, and should really tell anyone that wants to have a vbac to go somewhere else.  They may "let" you "try", but they will give you the hell the entire time.  Notable moments: 2nd Pregnancy: The doctor that delivered by 2nd child via c-section considered this his duty to ensure "informed consent" of a repeat csection: Dr: "So you're scheduling a c-section, right?" Me: "I thought I had to?" Dr: "Let me put it this way, vaginal birth is safer for Mom, c-section is safest for baby."  What new/young mother wouldn't do what's safer for her baby?  He wrote in my chart, "Advised patient of risks/benefits of c-section, patient 'declined' trial of labor."  I didn't even know I could have one! *Note: My son was taken at 39 weeks and was in the NICU for a week for being undercooked.  Not at all babies are ready at 39 or even 40 weeks.  Especially boys.  3rd Pregnancy: Ectopic After weird blood test and no baby seen on ultrasound, it was deemed I wasn't pregnant anymore and told I would get my period. Me: "What if I don't get my period?" PA Donna: "You will." I didn't.  They said they had to give me a shot used in abortions, which sucked. Me: "What if the shot doesn't work?" Donna: "It always works." It didn't. Me:  "What if the 2nd shot doesn't work?  Do I have to get it again?" Donna: "Surgery can result in loss of fertility, and the 2nd shot always works." The 2nd shot didn't work.  I needed surgery.  Her misinformation made a difficult time even more unsure and emotionally difficult. 4th Pregnancy: (currently pregnant) W/ PA Heather:  I assumed I had to have a c-section (see 2nd pregnancy), but was really concerned about the health and wellness of my child.  I didn't want a NICU thing again.  I asked her about going into labor instead of scheduling, she said I could "rupture" and that it's "not a good idea" because I couldn't have "the doctor I wanted".  Which may be true for some people, but when your priority is the health of your child, I don't really care which doctor in the practice cuts me open.  Next, I'd seen videos and articles on a "natural c-section" which promotes healthier babies.  It's nothing crazy, it just includes a slower transition out of the womb (estimated time extra: 2 minutes), delayed cord clamping, lowering the screen so the parents can see the baby born and letting the baby have skin to skin contact with the mom.  She had the most asinine responses to my requests. Slower transition: "The baby can get sick or injured if the doctors don't get them out in a timely manner." Lowering the screen: "You'll lose the entire sterile environment.  We won't do that." That's wrong.  It's a thin piece of paper hanging in the air.  The primary reason for that screen is for people that don't want to see their belly's cut open.  And admitting there could be some compromise with letting the screen down, it's minimal considering it'll be down for about 30 seconds and put back up again. Skin to Skin Contact:  I read in several places this is possible, I saw pictures and videos.  You put the heart monitor on the back and the IV in the non-dom arm and the husband helps hold the baby on the chest for just a few moments.  She LAUGHED, and then gave a demonstration where she pushed her head against the wall with her hand and said, "There isn't room!  The baby would be squished all over you!" and laughed it off.  Is that ever okay to do with a patients sincere request? She just had no answer for cord clamping which seemed super uninformed. My 2nd appointment was with Dr. Harris.  At that point I'd decided that I didn't want a c-section and was going for a vbac.  I knew that that I was low risk as far as vbacs go.  My first c-section was because I was induced for pre-eclampsia, I didn't get it with my 2nd so that's not a huge risk.  My 2nd was just because I was uninformed.  Both incisions were double sutured and over 6 years ago so I'm plenty healed.  I was met with annoyance and immediate condescension.  Dr. Harris said, "The risk of rupture with a vbac after 2 csections is 'way higher'."   I told her that I knew the numbers were 0.5% with a vbac and 1.5% with a vba2c and that the number as actually closer to a 0.7% with a vba2c if you didn't use any induction methods.  She gave me every reason I would "have to" have a c-section anyway: after 40 weeks, "big baby", complications, etc.  She closed with, "I don't know what the big deal is with having a baby naturally anyway."  These doctors are happy to have baby's on their own schedule, so if that's what you're looking for you - you'll do great.

Quick breakfast, trendy breakfast food place.  I love going there on Sundays for brunch and their bloody mary is delicious!  My favorite is their Vegan Southwest burrito.  They do not skimp on the avocado, it's delish!
