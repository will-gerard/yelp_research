My wife and I just recently made the switch to Craig from another CPA. We were having challenges with the other CPA, primarily as it related to timely communication. Craig has been a breath of fresh air and has been a huge help for both our business and personal tax needs. He has a depth of knowledge that exceeds our expectations and he is very friendly. Craig is a very effective communicator and his turn around time was incredibly fast. I won't hesitate to recommend him to all of my friends and family!

Horrible food, horrible service! We paid for our salads and drinks and left it was so bad. The server told us, after being seated for just under an hour, that they were out of manicotti. On a Saturday night at 7:00 pm, this place was out of manicotti. That was the last straw. This was after I had picked olive oil & garlic instead of pesto for my tortellini because they were out of that too. I was charged almost six dollars a piece for the pathetic excuses for salads and told, "but I didn't charge you for the garlic bread." We had sent that back after it showed up extremely over done and having a horrible taste. So I guess I was supposed to be grateful for not having to pay for that! Our server was a space cadet and my iced tea didn't get refilled until I said something after waiting 30 mins. for the server to notice. I don't normally write scathing reviews, but this place is worthy. I paid sixteen dollars for the worst dining experience of my life and left hungry!

Scott is a consummate professional and incredibly friendly! His detailing abilities are second to none and he arrived early for our scheduled appointment. I can't recommend this company enough and will be calling Scott in the future for my detailing needs. My car looks like new both inside and out!

This place is great! Their pizzas are amazing and the salads are fresh and delicious. The meatball sandwich is wonderful and you can't go wrong with any of the salads or pizzas. The service is great and the employees are extremely friendly!

We have been looking forward to trying this place since we passed it one night after we had already eaten. The quality of the food was very disappointing. My wife and I both had the Try 2 Combo and each had a sandwich and soup. The sandwiches were fairly thin and nothing exciting in terms of taste and the soup was equally bland and tasted watered down. It wasn't cheap either. $24 for two of us. We won't be back.
