Had a family member stay here while recovering from a stroke.  Bad idea!  The facility is beautiful, obviously designed to create a luxurious feel.  The rooms are nice, and the entire facility is very relaxing. The physicians assistant was helpful and thorough, some of the therapists were knowledgable and hard working. Hence the one star.  However, the facility is NOT equipped to handle patients with high needs, and they should not accept care of patients who are not independent. There are NO rails on the beds, a huge safety risk especially for stroke patients. Minimal staff are available to help, and the staff are under-trained and transfer patients to wheelchairs unsafely. If you cannot press a nurse call button, you are basically ignored, and even when you do press a button it takes a very long time to get a response. The call button was even "broken" for a full day.  Needless to say, another family member had to stay most of the day to supervise care.  We had to make sure meals were provided, because if you can't get yourself to the dining hall you don't eat. Vital medications were never given at the same time each day.  If you view the website, you will notice that the staff and board of the organization listed are mostly real estate investors and business people, NOT medical professionals. And it is obvious in the care received. This is a business who cares about profits not patients.   If I was recovering from knee surgery or any other minor surgery, I might stay here.  For any other reason, stay clear!

I have been using Eco Mama for almost 2 years.  Several members of the family suffer from asthma, and I have horrible reactions to most cleaning supplies.  I love knowing that EcoMama's cleaning products are safe for my family, and the smell is HEAVENLY!  My kids even comment, "mmmm, the cleaners were here!"  The staff is trustworthy and always willing to do what I need, and I love that they are willing to work with my budget to meet my needs.  I know that if I ever have a concern they will be sure to address it, but I usually find them exceeding my expectations.  I teach music classes from my home, and I am constantly getting comments like "Wow your house is so clean, and it smells AMAZING."  I'm happy to recommend Eco Mama!

Delicious!  Everything on the menu looked absolutely scrumptious!  I finally settled on the Chicken avocado & bacon sandwich (can't even remember what it was called).  Heaven on a bun!  My hubby ordered the French toast which was delicious too.  The fries were perfection.  And although I don't usually order a soda, they have those yummy mix-in flavors, so of course I had to get one!   Since it was my birthday, I got to try a strawberry & cream crepe on the house... Oh yum!  I'm bringing my kids back soon for crepes all around.  Can't wait to try all the other things on the menu.

Yum! $2 for an ice cream sandwich, you choose the cookies and ice cream flavors. The kids loved it and so did we!  Can't wait to go back.  Maybe next time I'll try a smoothie or their fresh juices!
