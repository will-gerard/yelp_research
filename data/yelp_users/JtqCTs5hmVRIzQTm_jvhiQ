This is the perfect spot to go to with a few friends. Great wine and great food.   The bruschettas they have are so so good, as well as the sandwiches.  They have a large selection of wine and each glass is only $5.00 each until 5pm -- The staff I have interacted with have all been really nice and helpful.  Some of the people that go there are wannabe foodies and snobs though, use caution. lol

Went here for a first date - It's got a lot of cool games, air hockey, arcade games, on multiple levels... felt like a little kid spending my allowance.. only this time I had a super smokin hot girl with me... so best of both worlds!  Outside they have a variety of really cool rides, a better than your average carnival and a mini golf course which looks really cool at night all lit up -- it's fairly affordable, depending on what you are wanting to do...   The place is pretty clean compared to what I expected, as it was my first time here... I'm definitely planning to go back, hopefully with the same girl ;)

I only stopped in here for a little while with a few friends, but from what I saw, it's a pretty chill spot.  There was a lot of people there, though it was the afternoon before New Years Eve.. still, judging by other reviews, it has a healthy population of people often.   The parking kinda sucks because if there is no room on the street, you have to park in the back and walk around the building and up the street a bit, but no biggie.  I will have to go again so I can judge the service and try the food.. which I hear is good. We shall see!

This is the only entry on YELP for Page Family Practice, where Curtis Page is the Doctor.  I tried several times to get an appointment with the Doctor and despite being told I had an appointment with the Doctor, I was only able to see one of the Physician Assistants.  The staff seems incompetent based on that alone where multiple times (at least 4) assured me I would be seeing the actual Doctor.  Basically wasted a lot of my time.   Then, I had one blood test done that the PA had ordered, back in February and I got the results back then.  All of a sudden, within the past 2 weeks, I have been receiving 2 - 3 calls DAILY from a 3rd party "message service" that doesn't identify themselves or who they are calling on behalf of. The message says "We have a message for you from 'YOUR DOCTOR' (how vague is that, I have a few Doctors) and asks for my social security number.   Working in the financial field, I come across several phishing scams looking  to get personal information from people, and having it be such a vague message... if there is a message from my Doctor's office, they have my number, they can call me.  After receiving call after call after call, it will not stop, I had to spend more of my time to find out what this was. It took some research to find out it was Page Family Practice with lab results....... that I already received... in FEBRUARY. This place just keeps getting better and better. Whatever happened to picking up a phone and calling a patient? We have spent our money, used our insurances, and spent our time to seek help from them, and they can't even make a personal phone call? Lord knows all the staff they have in their office, girls sitting on their ass texting on their cell phones and eating could handle that heavy work load of making a few calls. Jesus!  This place is unorganized, the staff is not properly trained, and the Physician Assistants are unable to offer any real treatment. They told me, "OH well, for this you will need to see the Doctor.." ................ OMG I WAS TOLD I TOOK TIME OFF OF WORK BECAUSE I *WAS* SEEING THE DOCTOR!  Stay away from this place. There are much better Doctors out there with zero hassle. You've been warned.

Place is bomb.. had the grilled Frog Legs, Lobster sushi Roll, and the seafood cobb salad for lunch.. sooooo good..   Been here once before and had the aligator appetizer, which was really good and also the crab stuffed shrimp.. everything was great.  Tiffany, the girl that waited on us, was really nice and very helpful as well.  Will definitely go back again !

This place is inside an Asian Marketplace and I wouldn't have found it if someone had not recommended it.   The owner, Chan, is really cool and friendly.   I ordered the house fried rice with extra "meat". He explained to me how really great fried rice is cooked by hearing it, rather than watching it. He said it had to "POP" like popcorn, and that's why theirs is really light and fluffy and NOT greasy at all. He was so right. Some of the best fried rice I've ever had.  I went again a few days later and got another order, it was that good. He recommended I order it next time with my choice of grilled meat on the side because it has it's own sauce and it caramelizes and it's so yummy.  Looking forward to trying more things here.   Bottom line though, good food plus friendly service is a win any day.

This place was referred to be by someone I know. I brought my Cadillac to be worked on.  They are slow and don't call back 9 out of 10 times they tell you they will, so that is frustrating.. but they so far have done a decent job, and are very flexible with finances as well. It cost $1500 to fix my car and they let me pay it off in 3 payments over a period of time I could afford.  So Juve and Chris down there are good guys. I'll take my cars there again in the future.

I went to this place for lunch, and it was great.  I had the pork belly buns. If you have ever had Asian style pork buns before, they use that same bun dough and make a little pancake out of it and put a piece of luscious pork belly in it with just a touch of a tangy Asian style sauce and a thinly sliced, homemade pickle. Soo good. I want these again. For every meal. =P  I also had the panko crusted soft shell crab sandwich. It was good. They obviously bake their own bread, which is nice. Maybe ask for a little extra sauce next time I order it, but yes, yummy.  I am looking forward to going for dinner. The dinner menu looks awesome as well.

I had always loved In n Out, in fact, when I lived in Reno years ago, before they had In n Out, my friends and I would drive 2 hours to Sacramento on a Friday night JUST to get In n Out...   But, since moving to Phoenix, I have to say that Five Guys is really awesome. They take a little time to get your order ready, BECAUSE THEY COOK IT FRESH WHEN YOU ORDER IT. In n Out also takes pretty much that long... I don't know what kind of grill you work on that defies the laws of physics, but it takes a certain amount of time to properly cook meat...  I would give Five Guys a leg up on In n Out BECAUSE they let you decide what's on the burger to a greater extent, they have mushrooms, A-1, and BACON! and the beef just tastes better IMHO. The grease is what makes it great! If you don't want a burger with grease, go buy a Boca burger and choke on it... seriously, because you don't love food if you think that and certainly don't know what you're talking about.  Their fries are pretty damn good and actually TASTE like you're eating a potato! Which is few and far between, TBH.   So, next time you are in the mood for a burger... THIS is the spot.. it's hearty, filling, perfect amount of a juicy, mouthwatering, foodgasm... :-)
