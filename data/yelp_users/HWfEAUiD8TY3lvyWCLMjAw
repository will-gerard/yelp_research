My wife used to love shopping at these stores but we haven't been to one in years because we haven't seen any and thought it had gone out of business. Saw this one on our way to dinner and the wife insisted we stop so she could look for some wicker pieces. Sad to say these employees are not professional so we decided not to buy what my wife wanted. We don't believe in rewarding bad customer service.

Came here with my wife and granddaughters and could not believe how hateful and unprofessional the employees were.  Not only will we never come here again,  we will no longer be donating anything to goodwill from this point on.  The corporate office in Arizona suggested if we didn't like being treated badly we should shop someplace else.  We most certainly will!!  There seems to be no shortage of bullies in this area.  Appalling!

Have to get my iced coffee fix at least twice a day from this company. They sell addictive stimulants which helps my golf game. Keep forgetting to ask about the cookie straw my grandkids keep mentioning.

The wife and I have to go to In-N-Out at least twice a week for fries and shakes. It means more time in the pool and on the treadmill but it's worth it.

The best tacos and tortillas. Definitely one of my favorite places for lunch now!

The food isn't bad but the horrible customer service from the manager makes it not worth it.  There are several Italian restaurants in the area that deliver great food and great service so I see no reason to return to this establishment again.  They apparently don't need or want my business.

This company used to be great,  but they are absolutely horrible now.  Crappy unprofessional techs at their locations and incompetent supervisors at their call center.  Won't be using them anymore and neither will my kids and grandkids.  The supervisor that I last talked to about two months ago by the name of Joel was unprofessional and rude.  Seemed to think he was being bothered by helping a customer.  Safelite won't be bothered by me again because I'm taking my business elsewhere.  Already found a local business that does a much better job and knows what customer service should be like.

I don't normally write reviews but the experience with this store and this manager and this company has been so horrible and god awful that I felt compelled to warn others. Previous reviews have stated that all the employees are crooked. The rep that we dealt with (Pamela) was wonderful which is why I'm assuming the manager  Chris was so unprofessional towards us and her. He looked bad by comparison. The MO of this company seems to be don't return calls or fix legitimate issues under warranty. They are not interested in return business. They also seem to target people who can't get credit anywhere else and if you don't fit that profile the manager doesn't seem to care about getting your business. Incredibly odd behavior from a manager isn't it? That should not have surprised my wife and I because we heard him badmouthing another customer on the floor. I heard a salesperson mention to a customer that Conn's (what an apt name. Short for conn artists?) plans on expanding into AZ even more. I hope that doesn't happen. I would much rather see a company like American Warehouse Furniture expand that has morals and ethics. Texas can keep Conn's. I certainly hope people are also contacting the BBB and Attorney General about this company. Two of the most detailed reviews on this company aren't recommended by yelp. What gives???  Update!!  I have contacted corporate and filed complaints with the BBB since writing this and Conn's could care less! Chris Hernandez told me he can do whatever he wants because it's his store and apparently the company agrees with him. They seem to forget that the people in the valley can stop shopping at Conn's. My wife volunteers all over the valley and has lots of groups she belongs to here. Going to make sure all the snowbirds and senior citizens know how this business conducts itself.

I've been meaning to write this review for weeks. My wife and I went to another furniture store before we came to AFW called Conn's and dealt with a very nice older woman who was wonderful but we were then bullied by the manager Chris at Conn's and his associate  Debbie so we left Conn's very angry and came to American to shop. We had just bought a bigger house to accommodate our grandchildren and needed a lot. All of the staff at AFW were great and there was no bullying and no high pressure sales. We really appreciated the experience here after the treatment we received at the other furniture store. Thank you so much for being professional and not treating us badly because we're in our 80's.

Got some alligator bites,  crab,  and shrimp.  Absolutely amazing customer service and such a fun place.  Made some new friends here and my wife who is normally very picky ate as much as I did.  Could easily eat here everyday!!

Came here after dealing with another crappy company because of all the great reviews and I'm so glad I did.  These guys know what they're talking about and really know their stuff.  What a great experience and I feel great about sending my granddaughters here.  They've got my business from now on and I'm recommending them to everyone I know.
