Best Shaved ice in town! Fun with the umbrella's and ring game. They even gave my son a piece of snow to throw at one of the workers outside. Great service and amazing product!

Service was AWFUL! We were there for 2 hours. Chicken was AMAZING :) if it was based on chicken and music I would give it a 5. But the service sucks. No silverware, empty ketchup bottle, dry cornbread, mistake with order, order took AGES to get. I would try it again as my son liked it. Good prices.

Fun place for the kiddos! My son loves it here! It would be 5 stars but with the recent menu change, not too happy! Always had my regular 1/2 chicken salad sandwich, french onion soup and order of hushpuppies, then one day....all 3 were gone! Now all I get is a salad but we went from going once a week to once every few months :(

Their Happy Hour is very IMPRESSIVE! Drinks are AMAZING! The Orange Dreamsicle one is what I get every time. It is only like $5 for happy hour and is very large. The Macademia Nut Crusted Chicken Strips with Sweet Chili Sauce is to die for and only like $4. Such good happy hour specials. Very hip atmosphere. The only small complaint that I would even have is that I wish it opened earlier. I went there two different times in the afternoon and it was not open until dinner, bummer. Now I know. Amazing Food, Drinks, Service and atmosphere!

I love Del Taco, just not this one!!! Once I went to this one and it was BLAZING hot inside probably 86 degrees. I asked them multiple times to turn on the AC and nothing. Finally I told what I think was the owner or manager and he said he would do it. I guess they think the 3rd time is a charm. Another time I went there and had a coupon on my phone. They would not accept it unless it was printed out. Get with the times, everyone has a phone. I then left angrily! They have no play place either. Big draw back. I end up making the drive to one of the ones on Val Vista.

Love the green corn tamale and black bean salsa. Rather pricy though. But one of my FAVES!

The Green Corn Tamale was the most amazing one I have ever had on the east side. The green salsa was fantastic, as well as the bean dip! The only thing that lacks at all is the environment. It is not dumpy at all just not nice but they definitely have AMAZING food

This place is amazing. Spectacular service! The older woman that served us was such a sweetheart. So kind I felt like I was talking to the grandma that I never had. She was very interested in talking to my son and I and was beyond friendly. We got 2 99cent cones, steal of a deal! She gave us coupons to come see her again and let my son spin the prize wheel. I ran a yogurt shop for 6 years and I was beyond impressed. Very neat place for the kiddos too with a fun mural on the wall and kids tables as well as adults. We have been back since and the boy was friendly too. They have extremely inexpensive food options as well. It is one of our new hangouts! :)

Terrible place! Owner is sneaky and unfair! Brought $300 worth of clothes to consign and got $34 total. She said I was good and I assumed I didn't need to do anything further. When I went to pick up my clothes she said I could not have them back although she had never made me sign a contract! Hate this place!

The food was fabulous. Had pizza, salad, dip. All were to die for. Service was great and food was quick. Wish we lived closer.
