Don't buy the groupon!  I was interested in going to this place so I purchased a groupon for half off tickets, but then SMG charged me an additional $19 on top of my groupon!!! An additional $8 per ticket because the movie was 3D?? Plus another stupid $3 fee just for doing it online! HIGHWAY ROBBERY!!! They literally tripled their revenue out of me, and If I had known. I would have never bought the groupon in the first place and just went to AMC instead!!!!

Crystal is awesome! I've left town at the last minute so many times and she always comes through for me. One time she even took my cat in when I was without a house. She truly loves all kitties, doggies, and any other animal as well. Plus her prices are the best! Highly recommended and trust worthy pet sitter! :)
