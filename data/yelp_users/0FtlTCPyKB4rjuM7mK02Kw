A little too overpriced for the type and quality of foods being offered, but I can't dock them too much for that. Service is great and the outside seating is wonderful in newly revitalized downtown. Close to all the local jobs, courts, and firms, so the location is ideal.  Wait time is decent and the waiters/waitresses have always been pleasant.

I ordered a premium bouquet from them through TeleFlora. Was initially disappointed because it was not what I paid for. They replaced it with a super bouquet without hassles the next day. I was very pleased at their customer service.

Came here with a friend for a dinner meal. The service was fantastic and the portion sizes were large. Got the prime rib. Have had much better but it was not a bad meal at all. Delicious appetizers. Worth the price.

Hands down, one of the nicest Airports in the United States.  Very friendly workers, excellent parking facilities, new, well organized, and friendly.  No wonder its called "America's Friendliest Airport."  Phoenix Sky Harbor has great dining options, pre-flight parking, shuttle service, a great location in the middle of the metro area, an air tram, and does not have bad lines and rude TSA agents.  Go Sky harbor!~

One of my top 10 hot wing and sports bar joints in the valley. Been here day, afternoon, and night. TVs are always running good sports. They had soccer too during the EURO 2012 finals- so that gives them an extra boost.  Amazing wings, Spicy as he**, but so good. Great service. They don't cheap out on napkins, which is always important when you go through two napkins per juicy wing.  Food comes out pretty fast and fries are good. Don't have artificial taste. Prices are right on and you can come out with a full meal and some booze for about 20 bucks a person.

No wonder great clips is taking their business. They just can't get it right. super cuts has a long ways to go in hiring quality stylists if they want to keep up. I have come out twice feeling something is off and I only come here when the Great clips line is too long  The hair stylists are always not always smiling, although the manager is friendly.

What a fantastic retail experience. Lots of high end quality goods and their weekly circular means you can get some good deals. I buy most of my meat at Sprouts and it is really a cut above the rest. Also home of a fantastic wine and beer selection, fresh produce, dietary supplements, and the famous 2.99 sandwich special.

One of the worst sushi joints I have been a patron of.  Very crowded, noisy, rushed, and the sushi just isn't that good... bland, nothing special, doesn't even look good. No Wow factor here.  on top of that, it's not a cheap spot to go to. $$-$$$ based on your mood. Stay away from Phili rolls here.

Sushi was really delicious and the special rolls came out to around $10 at lunch.  The sushi chef could work a little on the packing and cutting of the sushi. The individual rolls were too large and hard to hold.   However, everything tasted amazing and the ingredients were fresh. Service was solid. I did see the sushi chef a piece of garbage behind the sushi counter when no one was looking- thought it was a bit unprofessional.

This is a great Jamba Juice. They are fast, always have enough people working, and their is enough seating.   Strawberry nirvana for the win. At 16 oz, its filling enough to pass as breakfast but at about 1/3 the calories of a traditional American meal.

Came here after work to get my car repaired.  I told the mechanic my driver side axle was broken. he told me the axle was fine and said he could do a diagnostic for 50 bucks, but that would come off the cost of the axle.  he drove around for 15 minutes and with the help of another mechanic.. diagnosed that it was, in fact, my axle. Quoted me 300 for a Nissan Murano axle. I told him brakes plus did it for 200 (read my review on brakes plus for my experience after this one), he didn't believe me,  saying that he had the best prices in town and he would match Brakes Plus. We called up Brakes Plus on speaker- and they quoted me 200. he was angry, lied and said he couldn't do it for 200 any more. He wanted the diagnostic money, but I told him they had incorrectly told me it wasn't my axle when I walked in, so he shouldn't charge me up front. He was cool with that, so I drove off.

A fantastically pleasant and authentic Latin American restaurant. Mix of Venezuelan, Peruvian, Ecuadorean, Colombian (basically South American) dishes with large portion sizes, attention to detail, and quality ingredients. After living within a few miles of this place for 4 years, my, how glad I am that I found this spot.  I had a Peruvian style Churrasco. It had a lean Angus beef sauteed with onions and red and green bell peppers. It had an egg, potatoes, and plantain. There was rice in the middle. The portion size was definitely filling.  My wife ordered the encocado de Camaron and loved it. It looked really good and the few portions I had tasted amazing. We took a ceviche de Camaron to go.   Server is an older gentleman. Very charming. Very genuine. They accept credit and debit cards.

Absolutely delicious and fresh food. Great service. Great prices.  We had the pork roast, buttermilk chicken, broccoli, pecan pie, and a few cocktails. Service was impeccable. Food was tasty and filling. The pork roast was cooked just right and was deliciously marinated.  I'm surprised I hadn't dined here before. We will definitely go back!

Honestly, the best Middle Eastern restaurant in Arizona. Patron this place once every couple of months and often in large groups for get togethers.  Chicken and beef kubideh is amazing, combination platters for 2 will be enough food for 3-4. Get an appetizer platter, it's so delicious and very healthy. Two varieties of Hummus and they are both good, dolma really melts in your mouth, and the bread is so fresh. Oh, and the beef strips are AMAZING.  Waiters are always pleasant and helpful.

We have been here a few times during routine Mill runs and for dining. Food isn't the best, but it is pretty good. Drink selection is solid. You should expect ten to twenty minute wait times and above average service. Stay away from the appetizer platters- they don't deliver.

Went here after a final to enjoy some lunch booze and food with some classmates.  Had a fine time with the beer selection. I drink import, but my friends that drink local beers had a field day with the prices.  Food was a little salty, so I won't give them 5 stars ( I tried a wrap). I did try some of my friends' food and was not disappointed, but can't say I was blown away.

This is a magnificent hotel to stay in Vegas. Wynn is decorated to perfection with a sense of modernism. Everything is high end. The rooms are spacious and special and the Wynn Buffet is one of the best 3 in the city.  Playing here might be tough on weeknights as the minimums on the table games go up. to 25-50 on some tables.

What a fantastic cafe. Can't believe I didn't know about this place.  Really a hole in the wall place from outside, but the inside is spacious, modern, and trendy. There is a large amount of seating, a bar area, and an outside patio.  Coffee was really authentic. Desserts were fresh. Really awesome atmosphere and good vibe.

Food was great, location is among the best in Vegas, but service and beer quality barely gets a 2 star.  Lots of attitude by the waiters and waitresses when asked for simple things like forks or towels. As much as I have to be objective and give this place a 4 star rating because of the chef's work, I have to say I will probably not return here in the future.

Easily one of the best bang for your buck buffets and a classic of Las Vegas that will never disappoint. Sure, Spice Market buffet won't stack up against the big boys like Wynn Buffet or Wicked Spoon, but it provides an array of delicious foods from every corner of the world and wonderful desserts. The quality is certainly there. Spice Market has not disappointed me in 10 visits. There are TVs in one side of the dining area where you can watch sports. Included in Buffet of Buffets.

It's like a better and barely more expensive Cheesecake factory.  Fantastic Cheesecake like menu, better service, right in the heart of Venetian and open late.  Came here twice, once with one a friend and once with S.O. on a double date. We have always enjoyed it. The portions are large, but are reasonably fresh and service is really nice.

In my opinion, the 2nd best buffet after the Cosmo buffet, but a lot of my friends and family prefer this one instead. Still, there is no doubt that this is a true 5 star buffet- one of the only true 5 star buffets in the world.  Designed with the utmost attention to detail in its looks and culinary offering, The Buffet at Wynn has an amazing salad bar, entrees, excellent meat selections for the steak lovers- lunch, brunch, and dinner have been fantastic here.   There is a bathroom in the buffet. Come expecting a 20-30 minute line.

Earns a 4 star for recent improvements and better attention; however, come here expecting the longest of lines- sometimes 90 minutes to get in.  They have a great selection of seafood, desserts, Krepes, cheese, and deli. Also, some great French styled cuisine. Service is a solid 4-star, design is also about 4 stars.  Located right between Ballys and Paris Las Vegas, it is at the center of a lot of traffic. Come here with your Buffet of Buffets pass.

This is my third time visiting the Camelback location, so I thought it was time for a review.  Yardhouse Camelback really does everything right. Their service is top notch and thorough. Food comes out fast and is well prepared, and the prices are excellent. Really delicious appetizers (get the nachos and pizza). They are great at making American dishes and salad and are average or above at some of the other dishes. For example, their burgers are extremely delicious with fresh meat.  And let's not forget their alcoholic beverages. Excellent selection of beers (as most of you know already know) and great cocktails.

Been here a few times with friends. This is a fantastic spot for pulled pork, barbeque, and ribs. It's priced pretty well and the service and quality has improved a lot since 2010.   They are also good with the sauce varieties and bring out chips to get you going. Also appreciate the towels on the table for the messy eaters.  Keep it up !

Finally, a restaurant in Scottsdale worth the price. One of the few top tier restaurants in the area. An ideal place for a first date or anniversary.   Food was aesthetically pleasing and delicious.  Waiter was friendly, did not rush us, and took his time to explain the menu. Portion sizes were filling. Dessert was fantastic and definitely seemed home made.  I am a big fan of fresh meat and I was not disappointed here. It was spiced to perfection.

Incredible food. Breathtaking views. One of the best in Vegas.  The experience at Top of the World starts when you board a guided elevator to the top of the Stratosphere tower. Then, you are seated in a slowly revolving tower with views of the entire city. The experience is accentuated by sky divers diving from the top of the tower.  Now the food. I had the chef's tasting menu with the lobster bisque, filet mignon, and chocolate dessert. The bisque tasted authentic and delicious. Filet mignon was amazing. Cooked to perfection with quality meat. Very pleasant and high. Thank you for a wonderful experience.

One of the hidden gems of North Phoenix/ Glendale. I recently discovered this place after we were searching for some Thai restaurants in the area. The food was amazing and the service was top-notch. One of the best casual dining joints in the area and definitely the best Thai food I have ever had. We go back here once every couple of weeks and often take out. The Red Curry is amazing.

Easily one of the better Latin/Mexican restaurants in the area.  Menu selection is large with very good service, prices are affordable, and with the amount of food you get- a bargain.  Burrito was a little sloppy and oily, but palatable. Tacos seemed a little more healthier, but lacked the content of the best tacos (not enough lettuce, meat)

Came here for a UFC Fight Night. $5 cover.   Wings and fries were delicious and drinks were really good. They have a solid collection of Scotch (Macallan 12 and Glenfiddich 18 to name a few), tons of beer, and great bartending. Food came out very fast and fresh.   For sport fans, this is a great pub. There are like 30 TV's dispersed all around indoors and outdoors, including a TV in the men's bathroom.

Came here for an anniversary as it was one of the top 10 Zagat rated spots a few years ago.  While the food quality did meet the price mark, I was sort of disappointed with the Ravioli and Oysters. We got a 1 foot long dish with 3 oysters on it. 3 is not divisible by two. So, they could add one more and make everyone happy.  However, the cocktails and the wine selection were good and the food was definitely savory. Service was great as well. Come well dressed or you will look bad.

Sushi: Very good tasting, normal price, good quality. Alaskan, Rainbow, and Dragon were the ones I tried. They tasted amazing.  Drinks: Lots of beers, Sake, and others. Good prices.   Service: Not too good. Waited a very very long time for food, receipt, etc.   Overall, a slight improvement in their speed would push this up to 5 stars.

One of the better international markets in 85308.  Awesome beer and liquor selection. They offer Georgian wines, Russian beer, Armenian mineral water, lots of Eastern European sweet, everything Asians, and fresh meat and fish. Also, lots of Indian foods and desserts.   The only reason I can't give them a 5 star is because the produce is not that fresh. They can work on making it better.

A custom section for environmentally sustainable seafood and a decent produce section.  Fry's also has an above average selection of alcoholic beverages and good prices. Wait times are minimal as the company has redefined the purchasing experience.

3 star without Boba. Boba boosts them up to 4 star.  Pho lacks meat and you will stay hungry unless you get some extra meat in there.  Kinda sparse with the herbs and the spices. Not the best Pho I've had, but hey, they do well.  Service is.. meh. They aren't really service oriented. Take your order and don't bother you style.

BJs is a nationwide middle to higher restaurant chain with a focus on beer. They brew their own. This specific BJs has about 8 of them.  BJs has really wonderful service. The waiter was helpful, polite, and visited our table with the right amount of frequency.  We had spiced salmon and Mediterranean tacos. Both were very healthy, but not too filling. a cookies and cream pizookie (Pizookie is the BJs classic dessert- ice cream on a warm cookie bottom) at the end of the night was a great way to finish. it tasted great!

The new addition to Venetian and its sister property, Palazzo is located on the northern side of the Las Vegas strip. Fantastic scents line the hotel and casino as you make way through this large property.   Rooms are great, service is excellent, shops are definitely among the best in the world with the Grand Canal just next door. Dining options are plenty as well. Since its a bit north of the lower Vegas casinos, its a bit more upscale and less shady.

Please. I don't know what the rave about this place is when there are so many BETTER and CHEAPER sushi restaurants around the area.  Let me be frank. The sushi was NOT good and NOT what I paid for. Sushi has come out wrong a few times and this place is pricey for what they offer.  Waiters tend to bore you to death with a history of each ingredient and the eccentricity of the chef's menu. I rather eat. Went here with a group of 4, bill was over 200, and left hungry. No joke.

Lots of really bad reviews for this place on the customer service side.   I have been here a few times with all sorts of people. We were never disappointed. Yes, its not your local Japanese sushi spot, but the service is good, the drinks are spot on and the sushi is delicious.  People should have their expectations set when they are going to a sushi spot in Tempe Marketplace on a friday or saturday night. Of course there will be a little wait sometimes (I've never personally waited more than 5-10 minutes).

Always have a fantastic dine in experience. Happy hour sushi here is the best.  Service is pleasant and the sushi comes out neat, packed closely. We venture here about once a month.  I just had a bad experience with a take out recently. We were shorted a few orders. No side rice and edamame sucks.

Hummus is barely good if you have had any home made Hummus. Gyro meat is solid, but doesn't have the freshness. Pita bread is definitely old and unsavory. They should learn from some of the fine pita bread bakeries in Los Angeles. None of the food options stand out to me and I do love Greek food.

I do commend them on their fantastic selection of brews, but their food is 3.5 star at best. I once had to return a vanilla ice cream because it was so tasteless it felt like I was eating ice.  They do get some credit for having a very nice, upscale, and trendy location with great service in a top part of town. I feel with a reinvention of their menu options, this place could be a hit in Glendale.

Cool bar with great cocktails and desserts. The moscow mule has a hint of cucumber, which is a pretty cool and unique combination. The price of the food is too expensive for the quality and taste, so it doesn't get the 5 stars. Try the tiramisu if you are a fan.  Also, lighting is off on the 2nd floor.

We had amazing lunch here during our latest stay. Had the tuna for appetizer and it was really special. We got to cook it on a heated rock and we had fun doing it. We alsk hot filet mignon, hot wings, and filet mignon. Everything was great. Service was fantastic!

Not as good as Touch of Thai (which sets the bar for Thai food in Phoenix), but a very nice place with fantastic service and good fresh food. They are flexible, the prices are affordable, and the options are plenty. $10 for a nice lunch combo. Parking is a little tricky, but you can find it.

One of my favorite breakfast spots in the North Phoenix area. I come here often with friends for lunch and breakfast.  My personal favorite is the Sun Devil omelet. It's so good and so flavorful.  Ingredients are always fresh and the food is always filling while being very affordable.

My first Chick Fil A ever. Really really good Chicken sandwiches. Chicken was really good, crisp outside, perfect inside. Bun was great too.  Fantastic service for a fast food joint like this. Friendly people all around.

Came here for dinner with a friend.  Got a large salad and spicy hot wings. It was surprisingly good.   Not the greatest drinks- the long island did not feel authentic. Don't know what they used but it wasn't the best.

Dropped by for lunch after school - went with the usual- shrimp medium spiced red curry. They brought it out with a veggie roll and soup.   Food came out quick and service was fine.   The shrimps were good/large and the portion was filling. Very good meal.

Kidding me with the 3.5 star average.  The best pizza north of the 101 loop. Fantastic happy hour specials, great service, and delicious pizza.  Came here for a birthday party, we got 4 different pizzas and they were all fantastic.

Food was fantastically prepared. Big, filling portions and looked really good! I recommend the chicken sandwich or any of the burgers. They will fill you up.  Prices are normal- the regular for a casual American diner. Try the antipasto before ordering food. They are 1 oz, but good to munch on.  Drinks were delicious. Beautifully crafted and alcohol content was right on the money.  Service was prompt and courteous.

The food here is definitely lacking. Over the years, I have tasted some very good barbecue. The meat used at Flaming Kabob was dry and uneventful. They could not handle simple bbq instructions. I ordered the most expensive dish on their menu (beef steak kebab) but it came out like a dollar menu item- uninspiring and dull. Definitely need to improve!

It was a fantastic ambiance. Great drinks, their cocktail specials are really unique and delicious, and the few times we have been here we have managed to get a booth.  I've always had a good time here and the servers/bartenders have been fantastic. Usual Scottsdale crowd so come prepared. Great place to sit, drink, and talk. Music isn't obnoxiously loud.

Stayed here the first month it opened. Definitely one of the best rooms I have ever stayed in.  Extra large extra modern room with a big flat screen TV and another small one in the bathroom.  Central location, fantastic gym, great view from the balcony.  The Cosmopolitan buffet is the #1 buffet in Vegas.

Crepes were amazing, really really good. Nice little spot on 59th ave and bell.  Good selection of French style food and wraps.  Service was meh. Tried to get us to leave really fast. The usual line: "here's your receipt, but don't rush" comes back a few minutes later, is the receipt ready?" really ?

I would love to give this spot a higher rating, however, the service was not there.  Went in today with my wife. We both had Kobe burgers (Samburger and original Burger) with a side of sweet potato fries and lemonade. He says we get refills on all the available lemonades.   Wife got an extra order of avocados. When the burger was brought out, no avocados. Server admitted that he had made a mistake. No biggy. Mine looked good, but it didn't taste that amazing. I had medium grilled.  Then, he comes back after a few minutes and asks to refill the strawberry lemonade. Comes back a minute later: "Sorry, we only refill plain lemonades." Honestly, instead of looking like a cheapo, just get the refill of lemonade YOU had originally suggested. It costs you 5 cents. We're paying $16 dollars a burger and $3 for a drink. Save some face.  Sweet potato fries were small and slightly burned.

This is THE casino in Arizona. If you don't like it here, then your next stop up is probably Caesar's Palace. This is a crown jewel in Scottsdale.  Buffet, lots of new and old slots, tables, 3 roulette (electronic) tables, bars, drinks, fast service and loose slots.  Dancing downstairs, a nice club, a beautiful resort, and they are always hosting events.  Walked out of here a winner more than any other casino I've been too.

Without doubt, one of the biggest bargains a few years ago when it rolled out at the 34.99 price point. Now at 49.99 and a limit on the number of entries- it's still a good bargain, but not as good as it was before. it's worth to try it out one day, but I definitely recommend trying out the different casinos, especially if you don't come to Vegas a lot to experience it all.   Included now: Caesars Palace: Bacchanal® Buffet**; Flamingo: Paradise Garden Buffet; Harrah's Las Vegas: Flavors, The Buffet;Paris: Le Village Buffet; Planet Hollywood: Spice Market Buffet®; Rio: Carnival World Buffet® and Village Seafood Buffet.  Disclaimer: Upgrade your pass to include the new Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace for as low as $15 per visit or the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio for $10 per visit. Please see your cashier for details when purchasing your Buffet of Buffets Pass.

Wonderful experience. Excellent food and excellent customer service. Located right around the gaming area- this is a bar/restaurant with distinct seating. Their food was super fresh, excellently spiced, and reasonably priced. Portions were really big.   You can order drinks and chat while they prepare the food. Go for the seafood creole if you like the authentic seafood taste. The server will tell you to pick spiciness from 3-10. I went with a 5 and it would compare to a moderate leaning to spicy for American food.   Enjoy!

This place is pretty bad.  I have never seen a restaurant with such great looking food on the menu deliver such lousy food. Service is not genuine.   Burgers are greasy and disgusting along with the steaks. Avoid this place no wonder how good the 2 for $20 sounds.  Used to be a fan of Chili's before. What happened?

Easily the best cafe in North Phoenix. Located in the Norterra plaza right next to the Harkins. Great customer service and pleasant environment.  Amazing food (make sure to try the crepes and wraps) and coffee options with lots of sitting area. Comforting atmosphere.  Try the no-sugar added vanilla ice blend. It's delicious.

Sandbar in Desert Ridge is a great bar / restaurant in Scottsdale. They have a good variety of drinks, their food is delicious, and their service is really top notch.   Try their chicken / steak burritos and barbecue burger.  Burger lovers will love the tastiness and freshness of the meat and the optional potato wedges.  Drinks are pretty well priced for a Scottsdale establishment. The bartenders are also pretty well versed in making exotic and rare drinks.

Seafood a plenty. The quality is somewhat better than the other buffet joints. Big selection of oysters, mussels, shrimp, salmon, and crab legs. Also the usual buffet food. Small dessert bar as well, Great service will keep you coming back. Expect to spend about 20 a pop.

A completely exciting experience. Some reviewers insist that it is not a "novel" idea so it isn't exciting, but iPic is really good. Everything is high-end, clean, and professional.  If you get the top seats, you get popcorn, pillows, and a blanket and a really sweet movie watching experience. You can order drinks (reasonably priced) and food.   You can get the bottom seats and still enjoy all of the above, except no food.  Overall, I've been here three times and I've never been disappointed.

I have been to ALL the casino buffets in Las Vegas. This is by far the BEST buffet in Vegas.  The attention to detail on some food items are extraordinary. The crab legs are sliced and evenly placed in small porcelain cups, along with other items such as Korean food. Every single item was fresh and had the best taste.  The wait time is not long. Dessert is extraordinary.

Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the cocktails are mediocre. They look great, but they aren't that delicious- but hey, if you're into that go for it.  Food was pretty good, albeit small portions. We had room for dessert and we were not disappointed.  Service was friendly.

good food, good drinks, unique sweets, but expensive, long waits, and poor service.  Come here expecting a cool, fun place with a decent bar. Get some cocktails *they lack alcohol, so don't come here expecting to leave trashed* and get a dessert or an entree. Walk around the inside of the Sugar Factory and try some of the sweets.

This is an overpriced sandwich shop that is not much better than Subway, but about double the prices and half the menu options.   Waiters were too abrupt and didn't seem flexible. Coworkers and I left with a bad taste in our mouth.

Hands down, one of the best steakhouses I have ever been to.  Walked in to a 15 minute wait, but they called me on my cell phone when the table was ready. On the dot 15 minutes.   Sat down and was delighted with a small sample of exquisite Filet Mignon. It was so good that I ordered exactly that. Medium came in exactly as wanted. Deliciously marinated and spiced. At $22 for a Filet Mignon, I can easily say, it's the best 5-star Filet Mignon under 25 bucks. Came with two delicious sides- I got broccoli and mashed potatoes. Best broccoli I have ever had. Got the crab filled shrimp appetizer and it did not disappoint.  We had Sangria and it was priced well and was delicious. They also brought out bread during the wait.  Very good experience. Will come back again.

Really fantastic service and quality food. We had the short ribs (amazing taste with carrot sauce), drinks, the Buffalo sirloin and the Ravioli. Everything was seasoned to perfection and the drinks were good. The waiter was polite and the ambiance was really calm and welcoming. Really a good value.

Came here a few weeks ago to get one of my car's axles repaired.  Called the manager before rolling in and he gave me an honest price. Told me he had room to fit me in and I drove a few miles to arrive.  I was greeted very courteously, with the employees all being polite. The car was inspected and I even got a coupon I wasn't expecting.   They told me the wait was one hour and I didn't have to wait a minute longer. Helped by the local Subway, coffee, and Judge judy tv, I managed to hang on for 60 minutes. The car came out on time, it was inspected a final time, and a few weeks later everything seems good. Definitely a pleasant experience.

One of the better Pho spots in Phoenix, Angelina's combines a high class appeal with great Pho and service.  I was very pleased at the Rare Steak Pho. The meat was very high quality and they brought lots of extras, including fresh cilantro and Italian Parsley. The size was enough to be filling, even at a medium. Noodles were tasty and the broth was pleasant.  The sunflower shrimp appetizer was amazing. Very good way to start the dinner. The green tea was full of spices and had a unique taste that made it very good to drink.  The ambiance was very classy. My waiter was professional, courteous, and respectful. She came to our table just often enough to be perfect.  Definitely will be coming here again.

One of the best steakhouses in Phoenix. Not very well known, but a hidden gem.   Service was fantastic from the beginning. Complimentary valet. Well dressed staff with expert knowledge. They called the next day and thanked us for dining there.  Steaks: Prepared perfectly. High quality meat. Not over/under grilled.  Sides: Sides are pretty big. I think two people can comfortably share 2 sides. No need to get 2 sides per person.  Appetizers: I got the calamari and it came with 3 dipping sauces. It wasn't too oily, but was prepared just right.  Cocktails/ Drinks: Great selection of some well known scotches (Macallan, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Glenmorangie, JW Blue, Talisker 10). Thought they were maybe a bit too pricey. Cocktails were delicious.

really fun place to be. drink specials are affordable and the bartenders aren't bad.  music is loud and there is a cover for guys on the weekends. this is a usual stop on any decent Scottsdale bar hopping experience  Dance the night away, avoid the weirdos, and if you have a few friends, get a VIP experience. we got it once and we had a nice area to ourselves watching the action play out.

Had a very disappointing experience here. The service was very poor. I was with my date and we left pretty dissatisfied . The food seemed reheated, our server was very rude and did not want to answer questions, and they made a mistake on my bill. I went out for a fine Indian dining experience but I will not be coming back here again.

A Fantastic Japanese restaurant we visited on a weekday night.  We started off with the side order of the beef and it was very delicious.  I tried the Katana drink (so good!) and the Tokyo tea (Happy hour special) and they were very rewarding. Prepared well.  Of course, we tried 4 sushi rolls. The crazy roll, the godzilla, spicy salmon, and Tequila. They were all finely prepared and brought out on one large plate. The presentation was great.  The service was fine. Only hiccup was the waiter didn't mention it was happy hour. However, he was very professional and positive.   The total bill was around 60, so it was definitely worth it.

Really disappointing. Dropped by here on a Friday night with my wife hoping for a good dinner but all we got was marginally decent food that was very pricey.  Cocktails were 10 dollars each, not bad, but didn't really taste too good. nothing special.  Servers were unpolished. Felt like they were all newly hired.  Food was not that good. New York Strip Steak was a small portion. Tasted all right, but not nearly enough for a young man. Asked for medium rare but got it medium. Wife ordered medium sandwich but got rare. Had to send it back (after waiting for 10 minutes).   Overall, came out to 40 a pop, but was a lackluster meal.

This is a new Indian restaurant in North Phoenix. The set up was normal, nothing too special, and its located in the corner next to Asiana.  I had the black pepper shrimp and the Indian chicken masala, with naan and a samosa.  The samosa was prepared fresh and was tasty. It could use a little more spice.  The black pepper shrimp was really good. Very well spiced, tasty, and fresh. I will definitely eat it again.  The chicken was poorly cooked and was mediocre at best. I do not recommend it.  Overall, a solid experience, not a hit, but a good spot for its location.

We stumbled into Urban Boba recently while hanging out at Norterra. This is a new Boba spot that just opened recently. The spot is clean with an extensive menu of Boba varieties- frozen, blended, snow, etc. we had a great experience. The coffee Boba was delicious and the clerk was very chatty and informative. Also the price was good- 4 bucks for a 16 oz. Will definitely be going here again.

Came here because I was recommended by a friend. Not at all disappointed.  Service was great, food was tasty, prices were good.  Beef brisket was perfect. Fresh. Good portions. Calamari tasted authentic. Not like fake breaded calamari where you can't taste the fish.  We also had the trifecta flavored shrimp and lobster. Man was it good. Really messy, but an overall wonderful experience.

I often buy flowers for my S.O. and came across this flower shop as part of a local Yelp search. It had a high rating so I decided to give it a shot. I bought a bouquet of 12 roses and had them custom arranged. I gave the bouquet to my lady at 4 pm. By 10   Pm of the same day the flowers were dead and we were both very disappointed. This florist clearly overprices its flowers, has a poor selection, and seems very old in its style of pre made arrangements with a lack of attention to detail. Stay away.
