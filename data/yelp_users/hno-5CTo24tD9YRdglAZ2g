If you people really think that this Safeway is all that ghetto then I'd hate to see your asses try to get by on the east coast...or maybe LA.    Granted, this Safeway does have its share of transients (who overnight at the park across the street), but all in all it's a pretty good grocery store.  For the most part it's clean. They provide those sani-wipes at the front door, and the wine and floral selection is kickin.  On occasion, I've seen some check-out mayhem, but for the most part they do a good job (during daylight hours anyway) of adding checkers when needed and are usually very helpful and pleasant (considering they're being paid minimum wage to do a job that you do yourself at Fresh & Easy or any supermarket on the east coast).  I will say I was bummed today when I did 95% of my shopping only to get to the end and find that they had neither the brats, nor Italian sausage I was looking for and i had to make a double grocery excursion to hit up the ghetto Fry's on Thomas.  I also have to give this Safeway props, b/c while my fave Starbucks (in the same shopping center) was being renovated, that S'buck's kiosk kept me amped in the AM.

Geee-ross!  The other half and I got take-out for this place.   But first a little back-story....  My dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant in Philly from before I was born until the late 1990's.  My mother says she craved Chinese food the whole time she was pregnant with me and by proxy got me hooked on Chinese in the womb. I bless her for having done so. I love Chinese and could eat it every day...willingly.  I've tried Chinese in every city and country I've ever lived or visited, as I always love to see what's out there and experience the regional variances and interpretations. I can usually find something good, no matter how nasty or base a buffet, or made-to-order.  And Lord knows I love take-out and a movie on the sofa.  Great nite, rite?  A few weeks ago I convinced the better half to go pick up Gourmet House of Hong Kong, if I paid and he drove. Deal. Done.  I ordered on the phone - no problems. It's rite down the street from our house, so dinner was steaming hot and in the living room within 20 minutes.  We queued up the DVD and we're ready to go.  The fried rice was yummy and OK.  Not the best I've had but not the worst either.  The BBQ pork app was good and I liked the dipping sauce it came with. Everything else was skank.  I'd say avoid the noodles at all costs. They were like nasty over-cooked spaghetti in a watery, flavorless sauce.  Even with soy sauce added, they did nothing for me.    I'm kind of sad b/c the other reviews on Yelp seemed pretty good.  The place is not that great looking from the outside, and never having been inside, I can't comment on that -- but I would never get take-out from here again.  At least we didn't get sick.  It was just bland-o-rama, which makes me sad.  I even threw-out the leftovers, which has only ever happened  one other time with Chinese take-out, when I left for vacation the next day and didn't want to stink up the fridge.

I used to go to Churchhill's all the time for my smokes, but this place is closer and upon first glance, cheaper.  My inaugural experience was with my stogie-smokin' buddy Dave R.  We went right after the gym (natch) to get our supplies for that evening's drink fest.  Dave's been getting us our Ghurka Grand Reserve (amazing smoke) here for a while but I'd never been to the shop before.  They had a great selection of stogies and I picked up a new kind of Ghurka (for me anyway), a Ghurka Evil Torpedo.  Damn, it was good!  The proprietor was helpful and very friendly. I loathe connoisseur snobs of any kind and I feel like I often get that sideways, supercilious glance when entering cigar shops or wine stores -- not here.  100% helpful.  I did confound the poor guy as he was ringing us up when I was explaining to him that Dave was the Mayor of the shop on Foursquare.  Oh wells...  Gonna hit this joint again today for some Labor Day refills. Happy Smokin'!

You need an appointment to get your oil changed. I walked in and there was nobody in the lobby and two gentlemen working. I stood in front of the first gentleman inside the door for a solid 30 seconds before he acknowledged me and then gruffly told me to see the other guy. I walk down to the other guy two steps away who just heard me tell the other guy needed an oil change and then asked me what I wanted. Then I told him I would like to get an oil change. He asked me if I had an appointment I said no he said he could not get me in that day was rather rude about it. Understand if you need appointment that's a thing, but the staff was extremely discourteous and rude. I wouldn't even bother making appointment to bring it in here if that's how they treat people.

I was in a hurry and needed to get some patches on a shirt for that evening's event.  I don't have a sewing machine and I'm not handy with a needle, so I called Mom back east.  She recommended some "stitch witchery" shit that I could get at Jo-Ann's. I don't know of any nearby in CenPho so I used my trusty Yelp app for Android and searched on "fabric".  SAS came up and I banged a Louie and headed over.  The place is a no-frills warehouse stocked to the gills with anything and everything I suppose fabricky-people use/need.  The place was PACKED with customers and employees buzzing about and cutting bolts of fabric and such. I snagged a salesperson, explained my mission and she recommended fabric glue.  I picked up a bottle and a $0.20 spool of black thread (ya never know when you'll need black thread and for $0.20 ya can't beat that with ....  well, a more expensive spool of black thread?!?!)   They had all kinds of neat things like patches and oddly, tiaras in all shapes & sizes.  I think the place is a big hit with the Quinceañera crowd.  If I'd had more time I probably would have perused the joint a little more, but I was in a rush to get home.  All in all, I was in and out in 5 minutes and felt as if I'd entered and left some alternate universe where people still sew their own clothes....but the fabric glue worked (for the most part -- I cheated and didn't follow the instructions, so my bad there), but if I ever need fabric, yarn, taffeta or tulle again I now know where to go.

Read the reviews on Yelp tonite and decided to give Arriba's a whirl.  We went to the Camelback location.  The place was OK.  Nothing stupendous and nothing God awful either.  The whole place looked pretty grungy, in particular there was trash all over the floors; bits of paper, wrappers, gum and such.   The service was "meh".  After we were seated a highly disinterested bus person or food runner dropped off a heaping wrought iron edifice of greasy, pretty tasteless chips.  They actually tasted more like cereal than tortilla chips. She also sloughed off extra ramekins of bland, but spicy bean dip and salsa.  She kinda dropped the stuff on the table and withdrew quickly as if she were throwing a diaper into the trash.  Our server barely spoke English and barely seemed to notice we were there.  She seemed either aloof or afraid to speak, which I guess was her personal rendition of subservience or something.  The BF and I both wanted to try the White Sands Chimi after all the awesome reviews on Yelp, so we agreed that he'd get it, give me a bite and I ordered the Arriba sampler, which was like 8 appetizer sized chucks of really greazy, indistinguishable and pretty tasteless finger foods.  He ordered guacamole with his and I asked for sour creme with mine.  His guacamole did not come out on his plate or on the side, but we were charged $2.50 for it.  I did get "sour creme" but it was more of a frozen glop of dairy than anything else.  The White Sands Chimi seemed like it would have a good flavor but I couldn't really savor it because the intense burning was too much to endure. The BF & I literally swapped plates halfway thru the meal b/c he couldn't take the heat of the chilies anymore.  I really don't think they're hatch chilies. They burned like jalapeño.  I buy roasted hatch chilies fresh-roasted at Food City all the time and they do not burn the crap outta your tongue like this food did.  Our server never came back to check on the food, our drinks, bring more water or soda and I literally had to flag her down to ask for the check.  It was NOT busy in there at all and I saw about 5 other servers buzzing about serving the maybe 10 tables total that were seated in the whole place.  All in all -- nothing overwhelming, including the food. It just all tasted like overly greazy fried corn chips that had been in a half empty cereal box for 6 months.  Other than "spicy" -- there were no particularly memorable or enjoyable flavors.  I don't think that just burning my (I suppose wuss-assed, from other people's reviews) tongue on bland fried foods is authentic Mexican.  There were some people hootin' it up in the bar. I guess if you like Big Gulp-sized margaritas, this place might be cool. Doubt I'll return.  The BF liked it though, so who knows. Maybe it was just an off night for me.  The desserts did look amazing so maybe some other time we'll check it out for sweets.

The eggplant bites are amazing!  Everything we tried on our first visit was top notch and very reasonable. I am so impressed with/obsessed with their buttermilk pie that I found a recipe online and baked one at home.  Pales in comparison to theirs!  We'll definitely be back soon!

I just deleted a huge diatribe that I started writing here in favor of keeping this short & to the point:  1 -- Dr. Day comes off as cold, arrogant and I didn't get the slightest sense that he wanted to do anything more for me than submit my insurance claim and get money.   2 -- His staff is short, rude, and seemingly bothered by patients as opposed to wanting to help them.    I will never return to this office and I will never recommend Dr. Day or his staff to anyone.  If you need oral surgery, call Perfect Teeth (see my review) and ask for a caring professional like Dr. Salb.

Literally "As good as it gets"!!  Everything was top notch!    Great beer selection; I had a French Kronenbourg, which I can't recall seeing in the US recently.  We split the spinach dip (on a recommendation from my other half's friend) -- amazing. I had the "Nice Little House Salad" (which, by the way, is not named after the French city of Nice, rather the English adjective, which proved true) -- extremely fresh, tasty and very generous with the goat and heirloom beets.  Enjoyed THE BEST rib eye I've ever consumed!  Flawlessly prepared and 1000% tasty!  I got a loaded baked potato for my side and I also ate my partner's cole slaw, which was creamy and horeradishy and supremely delicious!    The ambiance; amazing.   The service; flawless.  The food; divine!  It's a tad pricey for a weekly dinner stop, but worth every single penny of it!

Chuy's Mesquite Broiler is my new fave post-gym dinner haunt.  I heart the namesake mesquite broiled chicken. A  1/2 chicken + rice + ranchero beans + tortillas (corn or flour, your choice) + cabbage salad is $5.99.  Add in the FREE (yes, I said free and unlimited) chips & salsa and you're set!  The chips are not only free & umlimited -- there's an entire chips & salsa bar/buffet with like 4 kinds of chilled conidments including a delightful salsa fresca & my fave salsa (not sure what it';s called) that's like pulverized tomatatillos & it's super peppery.  They also have that curious carrot/pepper blend that's often found in SoCal & AZ.  Chuy's embodies SoCal/baja California cuisine -- right here in the desert.  They are a chain, not like McDo's -- with ~17 locations in AZ & 10 locations in Cali.  Each location is a little unique. I've been to about 3 of them in AZ and the food is consistently nom-nom-nom-a-licious and CHEAP.  I've been for drinks as well and the beers are cold & plentiful.    I like the Indian School location b/c, well, it's close to me and the patio is awesome for al fresco dining and smoking is permitted out-of-doors, natch.  The staff is typically young, friendly ladies and I have  anew fan at the Ind.School location -- she freaked out (in a good way) when she saw my Jäger tattoo and told me I'm her new fave customer.  Nice!  The crowd tends to be baby boomer stoner & surfer types & younger folks looking to dine/drink on the cheap, but it's never rowdy and usually people are very friendly and oddly communal for a restaurant.  There is a sense of community around dining at Chuy's -- almost like the OG's slogan "when you're here -- you're family" -- it's like, "when you're here  -- you're Chuy'n".  (OK, I know that was bad, but I had too...)  The downsides: (if this is a downside to you) you serve yourself on the chips & salsa (buffets do NOT bother me) and you bus your own plates & cups after eating.  Big whoop.  Clean up after yourself -- it'll make your mama proud!  Also, the tables can be SLIGHTLY sticky at times...but randomly.  Everything else is top notch, so I give them 4 stars.  All in all, for the value, the amount of food and the friendly, welcoming atmosphere, Chuy's gets my vote!

In my seven years in the Valley, Sassy Glasses has supplied 5 of my 6 pairs of glasses.  I tried one other place, wasn't thrilled and went back to my faithful source for funky frames and phenomenal service.  They're not the cheapest by any means and they're certainly not a full service eye care provider either --- nor do they portend to be.  What they do provide is an excellent selection of unique frames, attention to detail and quality service.  If you are like me and need to wear glasses every single (GD) day of your life (severe astigmatism so contacts are out, and no way in Hades am I having my eyeball sliced open with a scalpel or laser while I watch), then you're pretty much set with wearing glasses.  I wear mine every day, so I feel justified in making 1) an investment in quality, custom-fitted frames, and 2) unique frames that augment my look.  Sassy is the source for both of my qualifying criteria.  Quida & Dan (the owners) run a great little boutique.  They take the time to consult with you on getting the pair that fits your needs & wants and they'll order specific colors/finishes/models for you if they don't have them in stock.  My lenses are somewhat trying in that I require a weird prism in my right lens and they take the time to make sure 1) the frames support my lens needs and 2) that when the glasses arrive -- they are fitted to my face comfortably and professionally.  I usually make an annual pilgrimage to SG when I get my tax return (I've never had/been offered good insurance for someone who needs something beyond Lenscrappers inferior capabilities), so I went in 10 days ago and ordered a frame (not in stock) that I knew I wanted. Picked them up tonite, Quida fitted me and I was off like a prom dress after midnight -- sporting my sassy new look.

I'm giving Fast Eddie's props on several fronts: great food, fast & friendly service, clean tables & set-ups, excellent prices, extensive menu and good music.  This place is a typical diner and you get an authentic diner experience. It's not over-stylized or contrived like "5 & Don't Eat Here" and the value for the price is incomparable.  My friend Jason K introduced me to this place years ago and I forgot about it.  The BF & I recently started going again as he's a breakfast fanatic and I love the wide variety and selections they offer from brekkies to lunch offerings.  A few faves include:  - The Nicholson ( massive omelette of sausage, onions, peppers, folded around an order of has browns and covered with cheese).  This big boy is HUMUNGO and only for the most massive of appetites.  - Turkey Club (the fries are decent and the cole slaw is delish!)  - Pancakes are light, fluffy & filling  - Packard Breakfast Burrito - eggs, sausage, diced ham, hash browns, cheddar all wrapped up in a delightful tortilla & served with salsa & sour cream  - Three Duces (the name is disgusting but it's my BF's fave) 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon  Admittedly it gets busy in here on the weekends but we've never really had to wait more than 2 minutes for a table and the food comes in fair order.   The servers are fast, efficient and no-nonsense.  They serve you, check-in on everything & refill drinks but they don't bug you.  There's hilarious hand-made signage everywhere that makes me laugh every time I'm in.  Note that they're only open until 2pm, but if you get your ass outta bed like a normal person it wont be an issue to enjoy the deliciousness that is Fast Eddie's Diner!

Love the drive-thru. Trucked it on thru tonite and rolled out in less than 4 minutes with my super cheap carton of Marlboros and a smile on my face.  The lady at the window was awesome and funny.  Why pay more for name-brand cancer?

The BF took me here for dinner to challenge my notions of good sushi and expand my sashimi horizons.  I'm 150% glad he did!  Excellent across the board; food, service, ambiance and cleanliness.  OK, the ambiance is about as good as it's gonna get in a strip mall next to a Fry's Marketplace, but hey -- this is Phoenix. This is where we've chosen to live.  They have 2 dining rooms, a full sushi bar and I believe some grill tables in the other room.  The service was friendly, fast and accommodating.  They sat us immediately on a crowded Friday night at peak dinner hour. Drink orders were taken "tout de suite" and served a nanosecond later.  Delicious cucumber salad for starters came out in a blink of an eye: fresh, cooling and delicious. And then began the parade of rolls; Philly, Chimichanga, Bagel, Viva La Vegas and an order of Monkey Brains (stuffed mushrooms that were off the hook...umm...err....cranium, as it were).  We scarfed.  It was all fan-fishing-tastic!  All of the food was freshly made, tasty and super satisfying.  The servers stopped back by to check in and make sure everything was OK, refilled our drinks but didn't linger or interrupt our conversation or try to be our new BFFs.  I dunno what it is about good sushi but when you have it, you know it and it leaves you with a near sexual afterglow.  I had a full-body fish-gasm that lasted for hours.  Yes.  It's THAT good.    We ate like kings for about $60 (we did order a LOT of food that night) but it was worth every penny and I would go back here again in a heartbeat!

My coworkers and I were invited by the Tempe Convention & Visitors Bureau to volunteer for a few hours this week at St. Mary's Food Bank.  Being Thanksgiving week and the fact that mom is in town, we thought it would be a good way to spend an afternoon.  It was...and even more so than I expected.  There are apparently 3 St. Mary's locations around the Valley and it boggles my mind thinking about all the people they serve.   We arrived at the warehouse and to my surprise there were police everywhere -- directing the massive flow of traffic for folks needing food this holiday.  We spent several maniacial, fun & crazy hours packing bags, loading carts and slinging turkeys and veggies for families lined up for a mile to receive food.  It was organized chaos, but sooooo much fun.  The amazing thing was that we were jamming out cart after cart (each shopping cart could accommodate 6 shopping bags of foodstuffs for needy families) of donated deliciousness and the line out front consumed them as fast as we could create them. Some folks got 2 bag dinners: 1 bag with pasta, rice, nuts and canned goods with a frozen turkey, bread, tortillas & frozen veggies -- and 1 bag with fresh celery, cabbage, potatoes, fruit, onions and such.    I ducked out front once for a smoke and was deeply touched by the smiling, thankful faces of people receiving their Thanksgiving dinners thanks to St. Mary's.  I've never volunteered my time like this before and frankly it was so fulfilling, I think I need to make this a "more than once a year" activity.    Huge kudos to the generous and selfless folks at St. Mary's as well as all the volunteers from my  company, the Tempe Convention & Visitors Bureau, and the teams of other random volunteers who helped bring so much simple( yet necessary) joy to so many families in need right here in Phoenix.

The Bunkhouse is one of my "homes away from home".  It's literally so close to my home that I can stumble home drunk if need be.  It's certainly no upscale Amsterdam (not my scene) or raucous NuTowne (their Sunday beer bust of off the hook!).... rather a nice neighborhood drinking hole, with an excellent staff, welcoming owner and an outdoor patio that seals the deal for me.  They often have drink specials, host our local bear groups and softball teams for fundraisers and while the crowd definitely leans towards guys (no problem there for me), there are plenty of women and trannies that stop in for a spell, which adds color and inclusiveness for our community.  I typically meet up with guy friends here but also feel comfortable inviting my lady business partners and gal pals here for a drinky-poo.  Do not expect gay fabulosity.  Do not bring your attitude or drama.  Do bring a friendly smile and a pocketful of dollars to tip the servers.  'Nuff said?

There is a God in Phoenix and (s)he is Chinese. For the last 6 years I've been on a quest for decent Chinese food in Phoenix and come up consistently empty-handed. Diamonds answered my prayers.  Everything I've ever ordered (I get take out about once a week and try to mix it up with safe faves and new diversions), has been fantastic.  Diamonds is the real deal for Chinese in Phoenix, as substantiated by the fact that every time I'm in there there's  a very healthy multi-cultural   mix of Asians, Latinos and Euros.  When you walk in and you see the bubbling tanks of fresh fish & crustaceans plus a room full of Chinese diners -- you know the place is good.   The two key indicators of good Chinese IMHO are the fried rice and the lo mein.  No BS here and no fakery. No nasty dried out yellow/orange sazon goya rice with frozen peas and no Barilla scorched in oil masquerading as lo mein.  Diamonds fried rice (all kinds) is the best I've had in 30 years and all of their dishes are custom cooked to order and sered brilliantly hot. From soups to apps to main dishes, everything is fresh and delicous.  The one downside (which is why I gave only 4 stars) is that when I'm craving Diamonds, I'm worse than a crack-whore jonesin a fix. I need it  NOW.  And as they prepare each meal to order the wait can sometimes be laborious.  They also have a stock answer of "20 minutes" for any order and I've placed my orders in advance and sometimes waited up to 45 minutes for the take-out to be ready.  In their defense that has been when I've gone in to pick up my take out and the place got packed and I think they prioritize those in the location over take-out orders sometimes... which stands to reason when you have a hungry table of people waiting, I guess.  The lady who works the counter is always nice while I'm waiting, offers me a seat and a glass of water, so I cant be too pissed at 'em.  Face it -- we're not in NY, San Fransisco or any town with a real Chinatown, so when it comes to getting your authentic fix for Chinese in Phoenix, Diamonds is worth the wait every time!

I know this is a REALLY girly place for a guy to review, but aside from me wanting to buy everything that's not painted white, pink or pastel -- I heart this place.   In addition to the housewares and vintage finds, they have a ginormous crafting/scrapbooking section.  I buy paper and supplies here from time to time for my craft projects.  I could probably get the same things at Michael's or Jo-Ann, but I'd prefer to support indie business - -especially when it's right in my hood!

I'm giving this place 5 stars for several reasons.  Under normal circumstances I would rate the food a 3-4, but I'm giving them an extra star for service AND an extra star for transparency (I shall explain below).    Here's the deal.  I love my asian food more than most and in particular I grew up eating some of the most amazing Chinese in Philadelphia because my dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant.  We had it at least 2-3 times a week. My mom ate it when she was preggers with me and I think I have about a half a Chinese chromosome because of that.  That said, I'm usually pretty discerning about Chinese food and in most cases I'm hyper critical of the fried rice and the lo mein.  My roommate wanted us to order from Kwan & Wok the other nite because it was raining, we were both feeling lazy and he wanted delivery.  I rallied for my fave Diamonds just down the street, but as it was Wednesday, they were closed. So I capitulated and said I'd give Kwan & Wok a try.  The roomie's had it before and loves that they deliver.  We didn't have a menu on-hand, but sure enough they have a very efficient little website with clear images of their menu.  Nice! Everything we ordered was from this page:  http://www.kwanandwok.com/menu6.html  Now my first reaction when I saw the website was "oh gross....they admit that this is Chinese FAST FOOD".  My roomie doesn't know from good Chinese and thinks that Panda Express is the bee's knees. We selected several items and called in our order: Egg Flower Soup, Pork Fried Rice, PorkEgg Foo Young and  House Lo Mein.  How long is the wait, I ask.  He says the guy said 45 minutes (and I grumble with the hungry grumpies), but I bet it'll be here sooner, my roomie speculates. Sure as sunshine in Arizona, the doorbell rings 20 minutes later and the order was 100% correct and faster than expected!  We unpack everything & everything looks great, smells delicious and tastes even better!  Bonus materials -- we got 1 1/2 cartons of white rice (I've noticed that my fave Diamonds does not give you white rice unless you specifically ask for it).  We also got a nice assortment of condiments, fortune cookies AND a free batch of crab puffs!  Score! K&W wins an extra star for service; (1) super fast delivery and (2) free goodies go a long way!  The egg foo young was AMAZING!!  The lo mein, awesome. The soup, good. The fried rice was actually OK, considering the name of the restaurant and here's where I'm giving another extra star for transparency.  Kwan & Wok doesn't portend to be a fancy-schmancy upscale joint. They don't even pretend to be pedestrian fare.  The actual name of the restaurant, as indicated on their website and menu is "Kwan & Wok Chinese Fast Food" -- and that's what it was.  I wouldn't go to McDonalds if I wanted Ruth's Chris and I wouldn't go to Pizzeria Bianco expecting Domino's schlock.  Kwan & Wok tells you right up front, "we are fast food" and that's what it is. For that matter, the food did arrive super fast AND frankly I think their Egg Foo Young & Lo Mein had better flavor than a lot of places I've tried.  I will definitely order from them again and hope that future experiences are consistent with my first, when I'm in the mood/need for Chinese Fast Food!

Following fast on the footsteps of my recent excursion to Totties Asian Fusion II with Alex C -- I took my new boy-toy to the orig, as we were craving both sushi AND thom khak kai soup.  Smart choice.  This location was equally chock full of deliciousness although we went a bit of a different route for dinner than my 1st experience at Totties 2.  Steve was in the mood for sushi and loves the stuff. I like certain kinds and was still hardcore craving the thom khak kai soup from last time. Great compromise and everything pan-Asian under one roof makes it very convenient and easy to love this Tottie's location.   We started off with my fave Thai soup and a delicious plate of spicy cucumber.  Steve said he's not really even a fan of cucumber but we mawed this stuff down.  The soup was amazing and we both agreed that we could bathe in this stuff!  That's how good it is!  Then the sushi started coming out. I don't even remember what all we ordered but I think the two of us packed away 4 kinds of rolls and Steve had some sashimi.  The sushi was fantastic and the staff was hell-bent on keeping our Pepsi's & waters re-filled and checked in regularly to make sure everything was going well. It was.  So I've now had 2 amazing experiences at 2 separate Tottie's locations and God forbid Tottie should ever decide to change professions, but if she were to do so, I pray she starts teaching classes at a restaurant school (or consults), because she most definitely understands & executes flawlessly on the concepts of service, cleanliness, fresh food and tasty experimentation.  She could help a lot of places with great food but shitty service.  Both Tottie's locations now get my 5 stars and I'll be back again & again to immerse myself in the complete Zen that is Tottie's Asian Fusion.

We had dessert & coffee here on Valentine's Day.  Not sure I would normally come here but we specifically came to see the lovely & talented Judy Roberts on the ivories and were delighted by her vocal accompanist, the enchanting Margot Reed.  That duo rocks our socks!  JUDY! JUDY!! JUDY!!!

This place effing rocks!  Boylan, Moxie, Faygo, Dad's, Fentimans, Kutztown Soda Works and more!  Like 1400 kinds of bevvies!  Since moving from my native Pennsylvania Dutch country I've had a dickens of a time finding birch beer anywhere.  These guys have multiple different kinds and I grabbed a bottle of each to sample.  I also got some dry & extra dry ginger ales and the BF got a Fentimans Curiosity Cola and a Faygo Rock & Rye (cream soda). Everything so far has been amazing!!  Ever since a transatlantic flight about 15 years ago when I had my frist taste of Canada Dry "Extra Dry "Ginger ALe (in the red can) I have been on the hunt for extra dry ginger ales domestically. While Pop didnt have that particular kind, they offer an impressive assortment of indie brews, hard to find sodas, nostalgic bevvies, lots of cane sugar sodas (as opposed to the high fructose schlock forced upon us elsewhere).  They had a wide selection of European bevvies and many kinds of ginger beer (Moscow Mule, anyone??)  Lots of diet sodas too if you have "the betes" and can't drink sugar anymore.   You can sample sodas by buying just a bottle of each or buy things by the case.  Most beverages ran around $1.20 per bottle which is totally right on for mixing and matching 'til your heart's content.  They have shelves of product and lots of different drinks in coolers to grab one and go -- or sit at one of the parlour tables out front, relax in the sun and enjoy a refreshing ice cold sodee-pop!  Whoever stared this store is a luminary and a God send and deserves to be knighted by the Queen.

OK, I usually see the glass as half full, but I've gone back to Cheeba Hut to give it another try and I just hafta say I think I'm not the target audience for this place.  Positives:  The staff was nice.  The guy who made my sandwich was super awesome.     Most of the other guys I felt like they were sneering at me (maybe I was paranoid, man).  Maybe it was business attire and I represented "the man", man.  It always seems dirty inside.    The food, frankly sucks.  For $10 I could get a HUGE kick-ass hoagie at Jimmy John's or Silver Mine subs. Cheeba's always seem to be lacking in meat & cheese. The roll, which was admittedly toasted, was so stale to begin with it basically crumbled into chunks when I tried to eat it.  The tomatoes were still green (and no, they were not high-end schmancy heirloom tomatoes...they were unripe).  The meats were skimpy, salty and flavorless.  All in all, I think this is more about the schtick and stoned college kids, than actually serving up a quality sammie.  Maybe you need to be slit-eyed stoned and have the munchies to really get this place.

Sadly, another victim of Tempe Marketplace killing Mill Ave --this Z Gallerie location is closing and they're liquidating the inventory. If you've had your eye on something for a while, get your tuchus in there STAT!  The entire store is 30% and sale items get an additional 10% as of this week. I got a $149 candelabra I'd been eyeballing for months -- for $40!!  It was already on sale at 70% off and they threw in an additional 10% off the sale price. Cannot beat that with a bat!

The dead walk amongst us.  This location is D-E-A-D and they're down to hawking the fixture's on the street. You might find some last ditch deals but you probably need to do so by month's end (Feb 2009).  Looking dire on this end of Mill Ave.  Thanks Tempe Marketplace for killing what was once cool.

Starbucks, you evil little addiction. Before moving to AZ I wouldn't even touch the stuff (was a die hard Dunkies fan for my iced java).  Moved here and the dearth of Dunkies forced my hand to sip some S-bucks.  Fast fwd to today and I'm a balls-out addict.  Evil and odd how that happens.  I get my morning fix at the 7th St location (see my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-coffee-phoenix-4#hrid:sO9RZ18XimUtEGPIWtbSwQ/src:self ) but as I work on Mill Ave I sometimes need an afternoon re-fill and patronize the Mill Ave location.  The product's the same as every other Starbucks in the world, so what differentiates one location from another?  The staff and service, and herein lies my issue.  Just about everyone who works here is great, but man alive you guys are so slow sometimes.   I walk 2 1/2 blocks from my office to come here and the entire round-trip affair is a painstaking half an hour!!  How can this be?  I understand that you're a high foot traffic location (right off campus and city hall), but I recommend you drink your own Kool-Ade, do a shot of espresso (Yes Virgina, there's NO "X" in espresso), and put some pep in your step!!  Again, I have to reiterate that the staff here is super friendly and accommodating, I just wish it didn't take so long to re-fuel my tank.

Go-Kat-Go is the coolest indie shop in all of Phoenix, bar none! Whether you're rock-a-billy, goth, alternative, coolster, hipster, kustom karster or just downright curious, this emporium of oddities is the place to go for all your vintage, kustom, clothing and décor needs.  Nestled in a very up-and-coming plaza on north 7th street (next to Ticoz), these guys are the best shop owners I've ever met.  They're sincere, helpful and always have something for me to spend my money on.    Go-Kat-Go is my one-stop weekend ritual when I need a little judgah-budgeah, bric-a-brac, a new hat or t-shirt, or I'm just in the mood to feel welcome amongst like-minded folk.  Brandy and Miss Amy are always good for some straight-up, low-down convo.  The store just feels like home.    They supply  the best indie hair pomades, waxes and workings to make my coiff rock.  Also check out the oh-so-fun and mysterious $4 grab bags -- always good for a cheap thrill!  I can't say enough good things about these guys.  If you're gonna drop a buck in Phoenix -- DO IT HERE!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this shop and the proprietors Brandi & Christian.  They're such solid folks and always good for a rare find and something stylee!  TheHandsome and I went and visited them today in their new digs at 1504 Grand Ave, Phoenix, AZ (next to Bikini Lounge) and picked up some awesome stuff and a new Jackalope Trading Post t-shirt, (which, I suspect will be uniform of 2013!).  Swing by and see them in their new space and definitely come to for March Art Walk.  It's gonna be jammin'!

I've heard all the hype for years and this place turned out to be precisely what I expected; overblown nonsense that wishes it were in Manhattan.  We came here late night, post dinner rush around 9:30pm on a week night.  Sat on the patio. Had horrible service; slower than molasses in January in Anchorage Alaska.  Our server (if you can call him that -- he was more like an entitled lump expecting a tip), Christian never came back to check on us, offer refills or ask about dessert. I had to practically ambush him like a guerrilla warrior to get him to bring me the check. After that we waited another 10 minutes for him to run my card, even though the patio was empty.  The food was OK,but nothing memorable or extraordinary.  I'd sooner eat McDonald's Dollar Menu burgers then spend money here again.  Just a waste or my time and money.

One of my Top 5 Best Finds in Phoenix.  Amazing inventory.  Outstanding service.  Phenomenal atmosphere.  In the bar/lounge area, Russell really knows his stuff; from spirits to smokes, this boy is skilled beyond his years (such a baby face on such an intelligent man), and can make recommendations that hit the mark every time on drinks, stogies and more.  THAT is true service.  The locale is fantastic for impressing a client or hanging out with friends in an intimate, mature and refined setting.  I wish they'd open a location in CenPho, so I could go more often.

I have to say I'm rather disappointed after my half hour + trek to Chandler only to be served cold Chinese food in a cavernous (and empty) retail location.  I'd read all the rave reviews about Jade Red Chicken and was amped for some kick ass grub.  Three different people I know personally  all told me I needed to check out CB as well and one of my buds, whose culinary curiosity is on par with mine, says he literally craves this stuff.  I was pretty stoked to try something new tonite for dinner as we tend to get bogged down in central phoenix and eat at the same places over & over again.  It's Friday nite, I'd had a few beers after work and had  a pretty light lunch, so I was beyond peckish and downright ready for the taste sensation I expected Chino Bandido to be.  My better half and I drove from CenPho down to the culturally devoid center of the Universe (aka Chandler), hungry and excited.  We'd read the reviews, used the interactive menu tool on the CB website and we were pumped for an excellent, if not quirky dinging experience.  Not.  ;(  The restaurant itself is in a bizarre, gravelly strip mall, oddly wedged between a nail salon and a store called simply "Wide Shoes".  We walked in to what felt like a vacant student union during spring break - -when everyone else is in Ft. Lauderdale, Rocky Point or the Caribbean and you're the only kid broke enough to stay on campus and work at your library job.  There were maybe 25-30 other diners in the place but it is so huge inside that it felt empty and barren.  We were greeted by a nice-enough counter lady who took our orders and punched them into the register.  I felt somewhat robbed of the paper-menu ordering experience I'd heard so much about -- no challenge, nothing unique.   We grabbed our drinks, utensils and straws and settled in at the end of a LOOOONG vacant  Rubbermaid folding table. Jason asked why they had church buffet tables set up.  I thought maybe there was something cool about them....but nope...just cheap tables.  We looked around a bit while we waited for our food to come over and raised our eyebrows questioningly at one another. I kept waiting to "get it" -- which I figured we would when the food arrived.  There were some screaming kids running around while their parents ignored them, chatted with one another and texted.  (BRATS! BRATS!! BRATS!!!  Get outta my yard!!  ...I yelled inside my head like that mean old lady from down the block when I was a kid).   My annoyance with bad parenting aside --I couldn't figure out why everyone loved this place. It has all the ambiance of a med-clinic. I felt like at any minute a middle-aged woman in chili-pepper-embellished scrubs would shuffle over, hand me a clipboard with a flower-shaped pen, ask me to sign a release form and pay my co-pay.  There wasn't even MUZAK playing -- there was NO music playing which made the place seem even more devoid of life.  The food soon arrived and we dug in eagerly. Everything was a smidge above room temp -- if that, and pretty boring to be frank. The Jade Red Chicken is pretty comparable to Panda Express' orange chicken.  The BBQ'd pork didn't seem to have any asian BBQ flavor -- more like roasted pork soaked in sugar and the cold, thick refried beans could have come from Taco Bell or a can. Nothing unordinary or even interesting here. The only thing that was in the least bit interesting was the pork fried rice which tasted oddly like it'd been cooked with cheap white sherry and shallots -- which I've not experienced before with fried rice. That was "atypical" but certainly not interesting or enchanting.  The only redeeming thing about the meal was the Snickerdoodle which seemed oddly out of place for either Mexican or Asian food.  It was pretty good though.  Even though I was physically full after the meal I felt very emotionally empty, oddly depressed about Chandler, its environs and its residents.  Everyone else in the joint seemed oddly devoid of emotion as -- certainloy not like people who go out to dinner on a Friday evening.    I'm thinking we should have aimed the car towards the original Chino Bandido in the Aves.  I am  a fan of asian and latin foods and admittedly have an odd penchant for cheap asian buffets -- so I'm usually pretty tolerant of cheap bad fried foods.  I'm thinking that the original divey joint didn't translate well to Chandler, so I'm willing to give CB another try -- just never again in the east valley.   Please someone explain to me what I'm missing here.

Overpriced & overrated.  I had drinks & dinner here once with the BF.  The bartender was super cute, accommodating & friendly. The wait staff was friendly. The food was on the steep side and frankly not so great.  Perhaps my expectations were overblown as I'd heard so many good things about TICOZ over the years.    The thing that skanked me out the most was an app that I'd had high hopes for -- a curious blend of 2 of my fave things lin life (fresh hummus & fresh guac), but it really failed as an ensemble.  The chef was super awesome & she came out and chatted with us.  Not b/c I complained or anything.  Just cuz...  I liked that.  All in all I owe TICOZ another visit b/c I feel like I missed something...but I'll have to wait until I get that raise...

Generally I'm not a huge fan of Macy's just because I'm enamored of the brand itself, which is why I feel like so many people love Macy's.  Yes, you have to give them props for longevity, the parade in NYC, Miracle on 34th St.....etc....but companies simply cannot rest on their laurels and assume that bad service is ever OK.  Which leads me to why I'm reviewing this location and giving 2 stars.  When me mums was out for Thanksgiving a few weeks ago we went there because she wanted to look at some things for Xmas gifts.  I drove her there and went along for the ride. While we were in the jewelry section she commented on a few items she liked and I made mental notes to come back and stock up for Xmas for her (after she'd left town).  When I went back I was astounded by the rudeness of the employees/disinterest in actually helping customers.  After several searching for a sales associate in the jewelry area for about 5 minutes with no one in sight, finally a middle aged white lady appeared in the fine jewelry section. She sort of hid behind a display and when I finally made eye contact with her she seemed completely put off by the fact that I had a question about jewelry.  I told & showed her what I was looking for, but in a different size and when she asked if I was looking for gold and I explained no, silver...she rolled her eyes and wafted me away with her hand back towards the "cheap" jewelry.   Fortunately for me (and Macy's) a lovely lady named Shell appeared and rushed over to help me, (despite the fact that I was "only" looking at $100 necklaces in silver).    She was super helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about her inventory, made some recommendations and showed me several pieces.  I ended up getting the $100 necklace AND a pair of earrings from her and she was more than happy to help me, ring me up with me a smile and at least redeem Macy's momentarily.  Shell rocks and should be promoted.  The other lady should get the stick outta her choochoo and stop pretending she works at Tiffany's.  On the way out I passed mens fragrance and inquired about some product for my roomie.  The snotty little fashionista twink sales associate scoffed at my inquiry and and rolled his eyes and I thought I better get outta Macy's before my Shell-induced glow waned any further.  All said, I got what I came for and have arranged some nice Xmas gifts for mom, but my overall experiences at Macy's mainly serve to solidify why I abhor the mall, large retail chains and would prefer to shop local indie.

My better half and I stayed one night here as part of our 2 year anniversary "staycation".  I loved the entire experience.  There are admittedly some rough edges, as one would typically find in a re-furb of this nature, but all in all this is the most kick-ass hotel in Phoenix.  The overall design, aesthetic and service were incomparable. I love the artwork, the color scheme and the consistency in design and branding throughout the entire site.  The staff was welcoming, helpful and hip. We stayed in a king suite and the room was very clean, well-appointed and comfortable.  The AC was little wonky -- I think it was a swamp cooler, but I could be wrong -- it is monsoon right now and the 30% humidity feels oppressive to most Phoenicians this time of year. anyway.  The bathroom was kinda small, but immaculately clean.  The pool looked amazing, although we didn't bring suits and partake.  The bar was fantastic and the bar staff unparalleled. So much fun!  We intend to make the bar our new hang!  Best of all -- you get free calls to ANYWHERE in the world from your room!  How amazing is that!?  No one else offers free int'l calling!  In total the Clarendon rocks my houseboat!

Had 1 drink here once last fall with my business partner after a meeting downtown.  It looked cool from the outside and she had been there before and liked it.  I did not.  The concept is cool -- I love old houses and re-purposed edifices and was stoked to try it.    We walked in and it was kinda dead.  There was 1 group of 4 people in the front room chatting and I felt like we walked into their living room and interrupted a private conversation when we entered.    The bartender saw us walk in and walked out thru the back.  We saddled up to the bar. When she returned she didnt greet us or even acknowledge us and then proceded to throw atttitude when I asked what beers they had.  She couldn't recommend anything.  She poured a crappy beer for me (just dumped it into the glass -- my 3yo niece could give a better pour), and a weak drink for my partner and walked away again.   The service blew. The whole experience blew.  Not again, my friend.

I'm not a girl but if I were, I'd shop at Frances every week!  I wish someone would make a guy-like version of Frances for me, but alas I'm fine with shopping here nonetheless.   Frances is a true boutique: unique, nifty finds, collectibles and lots of funky clothing & jewelry. They have some lotions & potions but the main focus is on fashion.    At Xmas time they have an awesome assortment of funky ornaments and decor and lots of fun finds for Xmas gift giving.    A lot of what I loved about Frances moved over to Smeeks, and I'm equally happy to visit that magical candyland any day of the week.   These bad-ass boutiques are nestled into the coolest corner on Camelback & Central, right off the lightrail & docked by the new Dutch Brother's Coffee Drive-Thru joint.  If your wifey or GF wanna do Frances, there's plenty for guys at the neighboring Red Hot Robot, Stinkweeds Music Shop & HALO Body Piercing next door.  When you need a unique, one-of-a-kind or hard-to-find gift or fabulous frock just for you -- hit up Frances and their kick-ass neighbors.

The Vig is a great, upscale dinner/drinking hole with style, character and flair. The service is fantastic.  The food consistently good.  The parking absolutely sucks (so pay the measly $3 and valet it bitches!).  Things I like about The Vig: - great outdoor patio with smoking section - great outdoor fireplace renders the patio warm & comfortable in the cooler months - consistently good service; attentive, affording, knowledgeable & friendly - hot bear DJ on Friday nites - bacci ball court on the side - Trivial Pursuit cards at the tables  Their sweet potato fries with curry-mayo ROCK MY WORLD, and the grilled chicken sandwich ain't bad either!  In fact, all of the food I've tasted here is awesome.  You can buy wine by the glass or the bottle and heir beers on tap provide a nice (if not somewhat mass-appeal) offering. I usually opt for the Stella on tap, but that's me.  All in all, great experience and very reasonable prices.  It gets VERY packed in the evenings, espec. Thurs-Sat and as I mentioned, valet is a must.

These guys don't need any more positive reviews. The existing ones speak for themselves.   That said, I had such a fantastic experience here today, I had to share another 5 star review.  Was out on business with my biz partner and we were a bit out of our 'hood and our element, so the biz partner looked up local restos with free WiFi and stumbled upon this lovely nook of a sammie joint.   Glad she did.    First off, just like it says on their website, they are a bit hard to find. The location is nestled away on the NW corner of 90th Street & Via Linda.  They're in a shopping center with a Fry's and an assortment of spa & wellness boutiques and a DVD conversion place.  The location is small, cozy, and eccentrically decorated like a slice of Vermont-icana (if that's even a word), with chill retro tunes playing and nods to "The Dead" and hippie-ish verbiage on their menu, which leads me to the food...  The food was AMAZING!  Based on some other Yelp reviews,  I got the Long Trail.  It was great!  Fresh, fresh, fresh with homemade condiments and tons of fresh veggies.  It came with a choice of salad (I chose pasta), and I also added a cup of deliciously chilled squash soup, in the style of a Vichyssoise or gazpacho.  Pure, chilled perfection.  My biz partner had a chicken salad wrap (The Deadhead) that was completely over-the-top delicious! We swapped bites of our respective lunches but I was unable to convince her to do tradesies on the second halves of our individual sandwiches.  Hers was amazing and on my target list of the next visit.  We also sampled and then bought an AMAZING fresh maple-chocolate chip cookie that blew my mind!  I'd bathe in that recipe!!  The best part of the experience was the staff.  We got there towards the end of the lunch rush and once the place cleared out and settled down a little, the owners generously took time to engage us in genuine conversation.  They are exquisitely down-to-earth, authentically nice and completely friendly, affable and accommodating.  We talked about everything from history to digital marketing to high school with them.  It was kinda like having lunch with old friends -- who we just met!!!    Totally sweet people and I wish them the best of success.  If they continue to run & build their business as they have been doing, there's no doubt in my mind they'll take the Vermont Sandwich Company anywhere they want it to go.  They deserve it; fresh, ample portions, fantastic ambiance and genuinely nice, caring service.  I wish all small businesses ran this way!

The other half and I settled on this place the other nite b/c we couldn't find the other Chinese buffet we were searching for.  After about an hour's drive, we looped back toward CenPho and pulled in here instead.  I had a bit of trepidation but you know I love me some ghetto Chinese buffet.  We'll, that's exactly what I got.  The selection was pretty good but there were only about 10 things I ventured to try. The fried rice was skank; bland, tasteless and mealy. The "lo mein" was actually the best thing on the buffet.  The chicken dishes were ok.  The pork spareribs were disgusting; mushy candy-red chunks of bone with hardly any meat, swimming in a gelatinous sea of sauce that tasted of only 1 thing I can compare the flavor to -- pink urinal cakes.  There was some nasty looking fried fish remains left dying on the buffet (the skin had been crackling under the lights for hours) and some assorted old food.  No egg rolls. Nasty dried out rangoon. The tables were sticky (which grosses me out completely) and the bathrooms were actually better than I expected given the rest of the place.  I think if we'd come earlier the offerings may have been more appealing.  We hit the place around 8:30 on a Saturday nite and they closed at 10, so they weren't refilling the tables much. Such is life in buffettown.  On a positive note, the fountain Coke was the best I've tasted in years -- perfect balance of sweet Cokey syrup and enough carbonation to not seem flat.  I doubt I'd go in again, although the register receipt did crack us up.  At the top it reads, "Great Dragon Buffet presents the THANK YOU".   Well, thank you GDB!

These guys were fantastic!  I got a crack in my windshield and then an offer in the Val-Pak for Integrity.  I called them -- super helpful, walked me thru the entire process, called my insurance company with me, came out when they said they would, fast efficient and friendly service and very clear, easy instructions on next steps (letting the window cure...etc.).  Less than a week later I received a very nice handwritten Thank You card in the mail from Christine Meakin, (I suppose she's the manager, but not the friendly woman I spoke with who did the insurance claim with me & State Farm) with her business card, stating that appreciated my business.  Enclosed was a $50 gift card for Maggiano's Little Italy, Chili's, Macaroni Grille..etc. that I can use at any of 4 restaurants.  Just like they promised!    These guys know how to do business, are completely ethical and on-board and if I ever need to replace my windshield again I would not hesitate to cal them. I honestly wish everyone did business like this!

No need for one more excellent review of this place, but I'm gonna do it anyway. After much ado & buzz over the last few years, I finally made the hike (and believe me, it's a 45 minute jaunt from CenPho) out here today for a client meeting. Wham, bam, thank you Joe -- I'm a fan.  Excellent food.  Killer restrooms.  Awesome pressurized condiments.  Oh, and they give you a $10 credit towards your meal on your birthday.  Cool!  150% excellence.

Great place. Unique décor.  Cheap beers (3$buck domestics on a Sat nite).  FANTASTICALLY attentive bar staff.  Lots of free parking.  OF NOTE: if you park in the lot north of the club & the Wells Fargo location (Grant St & Central) -- watch out for the 5 inch piece of re-bar sticking up outta the concrete.  It WILL puncture your tire and make a sound like a gunshot and you'll have to call AAA and feel like an ass in front of scores of hipsters & locals.

Who doesn't love Target?  I know I do, but it can be so dangerous to my wallet.  I always find too many things I don't need, but today's excursion was frugal and fruitful.  I got some great buys on mundanities like boxer briefs and paper towels.  Best deal of the day: Kraft Mac-n-Cheese 10 for $10!  W00t!  My 2 fave things about this Target: 1) the Starbucks just inside the door so I get get my addiction on 2) my buddy Scooter works here  What I'm not down with: they don't have drink holders on the shopping carts so my iced coffee slides around in the basket of the shopping cart and verges on disaster when we push the cart.  We used to have those cup rests on shopping carts in Boston, but come to think of it -- that was probably a Dunkin Donuts at the Stop & Shop dealio and I don't know that I've ever seen those in AZ.  The other thing that struck me as we walked in is that I must be getting really old. 2 times in the past week I've heard what was once considered "alternative" music playing in pedestrian locations.  Today we heard Nirvana blasting in the parking lot at Target. Last week it was the Cocteau Twins at Chilis.  I think I'm turning into my Mom.

I hope this was an isolated incident, because I really love Pappadeaux's.  It's not someplace I go regularly, rather reserved for special occasions. It's a little on the pricey side but certainly in line with the usual value they offer. The food, service and ambiance have always been top-notch and I've been saying for weeks now that it's where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner.   Despite the fact that they're a chain (huge in Texas and elsewhere, but only 1 single location in Phoenix), I feel like they operate like an indie and get it right on most fronts.  My favorite dish is the Crawfish Platter (a ginormous platter piled high with authentic dirty rice in the middle, flanked by breaded, fried crawfish on one side and thick, savory crawfish étouffée on the other side).  Last night's birthday dinner was unfortunately an absolute bust.  I was excited to show my boyfriend the amazing wonder of Pappadeaux's, as he'd never been there before and I'd been talking it up for weeks.  We were seated right away (which was atypical because they're always packed), but we did get an annoying end table right on the corner so there were constantly people pushing past us and bumping into my chair.  Whatever, luck of the draw, and I was happy to be seated right away.  Our server Erich came over and took our drink order.  I ordered a Coke and water.  I got Diet Coke, which tastes like poison.  Waited a few minutes trying to flag him down (admittedly this guy had at least 2 other tables he was waiting on) and I pointed that out to him and he launched into some weird back and forth about how it should be Coke.  You're tellin' me buddy, that's WHAT I ordered.  He took it away and a different server brought me a regular Coke with a smile.  Very nice.  Thank you.  Then Erich returned and babbled awkwardly about the mishap. It's fine. This happens a lot. Most people drink Diet Poison - I get it.   He took our orders and said he'd be back with some bread.  The bread and butter was dropped off pretty quickly, which is when we realized we had no set-ups.  It's kinda hard to spread butter on your bread without a knife.   We waited a few more minutes looking for him to flag him down again.  He grabbed set-ups for us and said something about "I wish we could assure that all tables could have set-ups when they're bussed but that's nearly impossible..."  Ok, whatever, I just want utensils and a napkin.  Thank you.  The food this time was OK.  Normally it's stellar. Maybe I was already annoyed by what I considered "Strike 1" and "Strike 2".  Both crawfish entrées were great.  The dirty rice was definitely subpar --undercooked and very dried out/chewy.   Erich asked us if we needed anything. I asked for an extra tartar sauce and a spoon for my étouffée.  He brought them right over.  At that point, at the beginning of the meal my Coke was still full. Like most people, I drank it intermittently while I chewed and ate and it was soon gone, but I still had half a plate of food to eat.  No sign of Erich.  No Coke in my glass. So I just continued eating and finished my plate.    At the end of the meal, Erich re-appeared and asked if we needed anything.  My other half motioned at my glass but at that point my food was gone and I just wanted to leave.  Erich then realized that maybe I wanted a refill and asked if I did. I said don't worry about it and asked for the check.  Then we waited some more.  The check came and I swear to you the fastest thing I saw the waiter do all night was process the check and get us out of there.  What bugged me was that I could see many other tables around us being served and having a great time with their servers, lots of smiles, hospitality and ambiance. I felt like we got the shaft.  I have to say that in the past I've always had impeccable service, amazingly fresh food and a top-notch experience at Pappadeaux's.  Perhaps this was an off night.  Perhaps Erich had too many tables.  Perhaps we shouldn't have even left him 10% gratuity.  Three dings on service, one on food and one on the crappy table.  I'll have to think long and hard before spending my money there again.

So far so good.  The better half and I checked out the Fresh & Easy which will be in our new nabe once we move.  Pretty cool.  We picked up stuff to make our own pizzas, a bunch of prepared finger foods for our finger food fiesta dinner, and some chicken and delicious-looking korma sauce.  I'll update once we've tried the food and see where things actually sit once we taste everything.  I liked the store -- kind of a small selection on some things (like only 2 kinds of dog food), but overall the selection of items was well-rounded and I'm eager to taste the house brand stuff we bought.   The staff was all super friendly and helpful.  One women who works there chatted us up about the products and HIGHLY recommended the tapioca pudding. I bought some and I'm looking forward to trying it. She said it's like crack it's so good.  That's an enticing vote of confidence.  More to follow....

So the tapicoa was "so-so-ca" --  not as crackity as I'd expected from the employee's near-orgasmic recommendation, but it was pretty good. Everything we bought from Fresh & Easy was right on.  The Chipotle Ranch salad dressing was particularly piquant and tasty!    I have to admit I was actually kind of wigged out that there no preservatives in things. I was worried that if we didn't cook & eat everything we bought from F&E within a 48 hour time period that it would spoil upon sight or exposure to sunlight (like a vampire)....  but that didn't happen.  I think I just have PTF&VD (Post Traumatic Fruits & Vegetables Disorder).  I tend to see fruits & veggies in the market and think, "MMmm...fresh beets! I can make that!" and then the damned things sit on my counter and suffer a slow, rotten death before I finally just pitch them into the trash. I think i have baby carrots in my fridge from December.  Yikes.  But I digress....F&E was great.  Not sure that we'll shop there on a regular basis (the selection was kinda limited and I'm not by any means an agro-organo-health zealot, and frankly I'm not very ecologically sound at all (see my posts on cheap cigs & booze)...but it is nearby and convenient and what we did buy & consume tasted great.    Maybe if I'd quit smoking I'd truly "taste the freshness"....

I heart VIP Taxi!  Peter is the best cabbie.   A fellow East-coast refugee, Peter picked our drunk assess up tonight from the bar, and drove us home, but he actually toured us through the Carl's Jr. Drive -Thru so we could get our cholesterol on in style after having imbibed WAAAAAAAY too much to drive our own asses safely home tonite.  Our bellies are full.  We're safely home.  And Peter and VIP rock!  Thank you for saving us from ourselves, Sheriff Joe and Tent City!

I'm a big fan of Cherry Bar and have been frequenting the locale since I first moved to AZ 6 1/2 years ago and FRIENDS had just opened in this space.  The new owners are awesome.  They've invested a fair amount of moulah into upgrading and renovating the place, which is paying off in spades with the uptick in foot traffic I've seen over the past few months.  They have a very nice appetizer/nibbler menu and are now offering a nice lunch menu to boot. I've only tasted the pot stickers so far and they were great!  Everything looks and smells delicious and when talking to Todd, one of the owners, his passion for food is evident -- which clearly translates into good food and good service.  I spend too much money in this place, but not because the drinks are overpriced. I just drink there too much with my other half.  Guh.  Actually the food and drinks are very well priced and the service is consistently top notch.  Best bartender?  Tom.  Hands down, no question.  Haven't seen Billy in a while, but that boy was swoonerific.  I'd give Cherry Bar 5 stars, except there's still no outside patio service. Smoking and drinking (if you're a smoker) is like PB&J (there's no gettin' 'round it), but for now you still have to leave your drink inside when you kill your lungs.  I'd like to be able to destroy my lungs & liver simultaneously.    The crowd tends to be mixed and all over the board depending on the time of day (or night) and ranges from average Joes to a smattering of twinks to bears, daddies and some seniors and ladies on occasion.  They play a lot of extreme sports on the TV's and the music has leapt forward into the 21st century with the new owners.  Mostly like a neighborhood bar/grille scene but can get pretty packed on weekend nights, as it deserves to!  If you want a great atmosphere, no attitude, mixed crowd, fantastic service and reasonably priced food & bev -- taste Phoenix's newest cherry and tell me what you think!

Used to go here all the time.  New management changed the format, the great bartenders left,  lost all the regulars and now it looks like a mortuary every time I drive by.  Sad really. I used to love this place,

Had a business breakfast meeting on the patio this morning and I enjoyed the atmosphere, the food and the service.  I ordered the Brizza (breakfast pizza) which was fun, tastily prepared and well presented.  I liked their menu selection, upbeat (yet relaxed) atmosphere, free WIFi (a must for meetings these days) and the self-serve free re-fills on bevies.  Our meeting was running a bit long so I went back in and got a choc chip cookie after my zesty, savory chorizo Brizza.  It was just OK.  Nothing to write to Mrs. Tollhouse about, but not bad and fresh-baked today so it didn't taste like Saran wrap.    The young woman at the counter was super helpful and helped me carry drinks outside for our table and bussed our table expeditiously as we were having a meeting which I appreciated. Everyone was super nice and it just had a great, chill, mellow, happy breakfasty vibe.    I'd like to take friends there sometime if they ever come out to AZ to visit.  Considering our current state politics, that's pretty unlikely in the near future, so I suppose it's up to us locals to keep supporting awesome little AZ finds like Scramble.

L'amour, l'amour -- toujours l'amours!  I love you Mojo!   My account exec and I took a stroll down Mill Ave the other day to have our weekly meeting off site. It was the afternoon and the weather was nice and she suggested we hit up Mojo.  I'd not been yet but I'd heard some stirrings about this place.  I'm thinking, yogurt.  Yeah.  Thrills. Little did I know what was in-store for me!  First off, Mojo gets big points for decor/ambience. They took that nasty former Quiznos and turned it into a pleasure den of low-fat lusciousness.  The whole place is so visually appealing that I just want to hang out there all day...incredible blend of bold reds and shimmering oranges -- from floor to ceiling the joint is spic-and-effig-span CLEAN.  It literally sparkles and the staff was all over keeping the place wiped up and hyper-presentable.   There are funky late 60's-early 70's light fixtures and form-molded chairs and shiny red diner-style booths throughout.  The music (which is so freaking key to ambiance and I don't know why so many people miss this), is a killer mix of positive, chill alternative.  The whole place is set up like a giant oval. Really good deployment of human factors engineering/usability with the redesign of the space.  You enter up front, bear to the left and grab your container of choice.  Then you follow  the back wall around and indulge in up to like 14 flavors of frozen yogurt. Fill your cup 'cuz it's only $0.39/ounce!  I got the mint and the pistachio (which was absolute heaven in a cup!).  They also have little "Ny-quil" sized cups for sampling. The green tea was gross - -avoid.   Next comes the best part -- two mini buffet bars of the most righteous yogurt condiments/compliments I've ever seen...fruit, nuts, jimmies..etc. and some innovative faves like Cap'n Crunch, Cocoa Pebbles and this interesting chocolate stuff called "flake". I keep wanting to call it "bark" or "root"...I dunno why.  Then you slide on over to the super helpful and incredibly upbeat & welcoming lady at the reg, who weighs your yogurt and you pay.  At 39 cents an ounce this stuff is cheap. Then go enjoy your snacky-treats inside or outside on Mill.   It's delicious.  The entire experience is great and the staff is top-notch.  After tasting the pistachio the one day with my AE -- I craved it all the next day, so the other half and I drove back into Tempe after dinner the next nite for a replay.  Unfortunately they'd swapped out the pistachio for "birthday cake", which made me slightly sad, but the mint still rocks my world.  You can sit on the bench outside and watch the freaks fly their flags and the business travelers & stoo-dents walking by.  Great people watching. Too much fun.  Too delicious. Too perfect a cost for a great time.  I say 100% phenomenal value and I'm so glad you're adding value to the Mill Ave street scene.  Yay for Mojo!  Yay for Tempe!  Yay for Yogurt!  Yay for me!

Decent food.  Nice service.  Excellent patio.  Was here for a business lunch this week.  Normally I probably would have given Arcadia Tavern 3 stars...it's OK but honestly nothing spectacular and their WiFi sucks.   Here's what earned them an additional star:  "Sweet Potato Tater Tots"!!!  Yes, you read correctly.  I dunno what genius came up with these (they are clearly not house-made), but man oh man -- they were GOOD!  I also had a house burger that was actually 2 burgers stuffed with cheeses, bound & grilled.   A tasty concept, although most of the cheese seemingly melted out of the patties during the grilling process.  Their ranch dressing was superior and did taste homemade.  Kudos on that topic as well.  I dipped my "sweetpotatertots" in it.  Yum.  Grrr!  All in all, a great little jawnt, and I'd"d like to come back for happy hour on the patio sometime. Their beers looked tasty & abundant in variety.

Smeeks, Smeeks, Smeeks, oh how I adore thee!  Trinkets, toys, candies, lollies and tiny Germanic gnomes!  I am in sheeeeer heaven here!  When something bad happens to me and I have to retreat to my "happy place" -- Smeeks is where I go in my head.    Smeeks is the brilliant brain child/offshoot of neighboring Frances Boutique and boasts the best selection of vintage candies, baubles and retro childhood memories.  Over the past 2 months I've admittedly dropped almost 3 Benjamins in this place, because I simply cannot get enough!  Smeeks fueled my holiday shopping for my nieces, me mum and my employees.  I even indulged myself and invested in the most adorable red resin gnome piggybank (that was $50 bucks rite there, but I had to have him!!).  Smeeks has sourced the most excellent assortment of vintage candies & sweets, funky. fun & retro toys & games, kooky Japanese collectibles and they wrap it all up in the most adorable red/white/turquoise finery known to man.  I like to go in and peruse all the cool toys on the wall. I've gotten a package of wax paper drinking straws (total throwback to my childhood).  I've taken fun photos with a friend in their retro black & white 4-spot photobooth.  I've found candies, sweets & gum I haven't seen since i was a kid, like: - CHARMS Assorted Squares - Chowards Violet candies - NECCO wafers - Cherry Mash - Pop Rocks - Wonka Bars - Wax bottles - Candy cigarettes - Double Bubble gum - Scads more... And they have their own brand of packaged deliciousness!  I highly recommend the gummy strawberries and chocolate covered cookie dough!  They have the MOST amazing kettle corn (almost tastes like Pops cereal -- no husks/kernals, super light and golden yellow, fresh beyond comparison)!  My fave newest find are these tiny delicious Italian licorice rounds (kinda of like Sen Sen), called CHIPS.  They're $0.05/piece or you can fill a tiny Chinese takeout container for $3.00.  That's the way to go!  The staff is uber-helpful and friendly. They will gift wrap your goodies for you, or as i did over the holidays (when it was busy and there was a line at the register), they hooked me up with all the fixin's so I could make my own goodie bags & boxes at home.  They gave me scads of ribbon, adorable printed bags & takeout containers, and lots of fun stickers with the Smeeks logo with the shy little gnome.  It was so fun buying a basket full of candy & goodies and making up my gifts at home for a personal touch.  If you're having a bad day, or simply want a fun diversion on a Sunday afternoon, stop in and escape to that happy place of your childhood with Smeeks boutique!

My buddy Rodney took me here a few weeks back and I'm just now getting to review it..  I'd had Pho a few times about 10 years ago back in Boston and despite the fact that I'm a HUGE fan of most Asian cuisine -- Vietnamese didn't "Pho-lly" do it for me.  Bad pun...good bun!  ;)  Pho Thanh is a delightful little hidden gem of a place, nestled into the end of a skanky strip mall.  There's an amazing Asian grocery on the other side of the plaza which you MUST check out (and walk off your meal).  I tried  a few things with Rodney that day, including #68 Com Tam Tau Hu Dac Biet (broken rice with shrimp cake wrapped in bean curd skin, bbq pork, shredded pork, crab-egg cake and all topped off with a delightful fried egg on top.  It was a lot of food!  I also tried the pho beef noodle soup (#14 pho tai bo vien) with sliced beef & meatballs.  Addictive!!  I went back 2 weeks later with my buddy Steve and got more #14 soup....I'm now officially in love with that soup!  It's a HUGE bowl of broth & vermicelli noodles and comes with a side platter piled high with fresh herbs, citrus and some very piqued pepper slices (beware)!  Contrary to the rest of the plaza, the place is clean, the decor sparsly amusing/sad remnants of the proprietors previous life in Viet Nam, I supppose.  There is a killer poster I'd love to have that looks like it was produced by the either ministry of tourism or ministry of production that shows a woman with 3 brightly colored balls of yarn  (would someone please take a pic of this and post it to Yelp!?!?)  The staff is super nice and comped me a swig of a most amazing fresh pennywort drink.  It glows vibrantly green as it sloshes & swirls within a juice dispenser at the counter.  Tasted fresh (like wheatgrass juice) and left an aromatic effervescence on my tongue for a few moments after swilling it down.  Prices are super reasonable (most items between $4.95-6.95) and  I haven't left hungry yet!  Props to Rodney for pushing my gastronomic envelope and getting me hooked on a new local fave!

Again -- i"m loving the tax-free rez smokes!  Last week we wet to the one on Riggs Rd (see my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/akimel-o-othham-and-on-auk-mor-indian-smoke-shops-and-cigarettes-chandler#hrid:U-Mu1JbyXQe8s7NGbZz5zw/src:self)  Today we hit the one on McKellips.  Love the fast drive-thru action for smokes.    Then we tanked up on gasoline. Some idiot at the pump in front of me was smoking a stogie while pumping his gasoline. Umm hello?  Fire & gas don't mix. What effing planet are you from?  Not only are you risking blowing yourself up -- but pretty much anyone within a one miler adius if the underground tanks go up with you, ya flippin idjit!  Can't hold that against the rez folks tho --I was just completely stunned.

I was recently introduced to the lair of lusciousness known as Totties by my good buddy (and fellow Yelper) Alexander C.  Alex had been to Totties Asian Fusion II very recently and was so impressed (believe me, this guy is discerning, so for him to give something a thumb's up -- you'd best believe it) that he organized an outing/evening for like 10 big ol' bears of men for a sake bomber happy hour & dinner.   See Alexander's review for exact details and descriptions of what we ordered and ate, but I'm going to make this review short & sweet.  Tottie's rocks. The service was impeccable.  Tottie herself came to our table and made special recommendations on food.  I've never felt so attended to by a restaurateur before.  This lady knows her stuff in the front of the house, but even more so, she can cook her petite Asian ass off.  EVERYTHING we had was amazing and her Thom Kha Kai soup blew my socks off.  I crave....for days...  The parking lot's a little wonky now during construction, but it's a small price to pay for this level of amazing food.  We were 10 hungry heffers when we arrived (not one of us under 200 pounds, so you know we like to eat) and no one walked outta the place hungry or needing ANYTHING.  Service & food to the max.    I applaud Tottie for opening a second killer location and I thank Alex for introducing us to this amazing pocket of awesomeness deliciousness!

Dr. Kiddis is the best!  My boss recommended her to me and after several admitted years of dental neglect, I finally buckled down and went in to see her.  Dr. Kiddis and her entire staff are top-notch, friendly, down-to-earth and 100% professional.  The offices are located in a plaza on Lincoln Drive, just southwest of the corner of Lincoln & Scottsdale Rds.    I went for my initial eval and intake a few weeks ago.  I was AMAZED at how modern dentistry has become in the last few years.  Everything is digital.  They used a cam in my mouth and documented all the trouble spots and shared the pix with me.  They worked up 2 separate dental plans for me to address my neglect and provided financing options as well (as my insurance, as many do, only covers a portion of their services).   They digitally documented baselines of my oral situation and we're moving onwards & upwards from there.  I've since been back for a cleaning & scaling.  This week the good doctor finally fixed some issues with my 2 front teeth that have precluded me from giving full-mouthed, toothy grins for the last few years.  She did an amazing job with matching color, and shape and my "new teeth" rock!  Full-tooth smiles, FTW!  Everyone in the office is super cool, great conversationalists and very friendly. I actually enjoy going to the dentist!  One other cool aspect is the music they play in the office.  They play CDs that I actually have in my collection at home and I heard (on shuffle, natch), ABBA, Enya (very soothing) and Ella Fitzgerald.    Dr. Kiddis is young, modern, professional and an absolute pleasure to work with.  I feel like she really cares but also understands that I can't devote my entire salary to dental costs and is working WITH me in a feasible & professional manner.  I recommend PVSmiles 150%!

Dr. Kidess still rocks, but apparently my spelling skills do not!  I misspelled her last name when I wrote the 1st review.  Her name is spelled "Kidess", not "Kiddis".  I've submitted a request to the Yelp team to update as the business name is locked, but please take note.  Durrr...

I've been to 5th & Wine several times now for business meetings and cocktails with professional peers.  Great setting & ambiance. On street free parking is typically plentiful within a block or two.  Fantastic happy hour with a HH menu, and discounted beverages.  They have a nice craft beer selection. The servers have always been accommodating in giving a taste of a particular brew before committing to a pint, and the music & artwork are interesting, stimulating and refined, without being obnoxious or over-bearing.  In particular, Corey (sp?) and Joe have been excellent and remembered me each time I've returned.  Makes you feel welcomed and appreciated as a patron.  All in all, this is a very comfortable, mature adult place to meet or eat and I feel equally relaxed in jeans & a tee, or a shirt & tie. I like that easy versatility in a bar-resto concept.

I am thrilled that we have so many new lunch options here on Mill Avenue.  After the deserved demise of Uno's & several other local eat haunts, the recent resurgence of restaurants (Regions is back, 5 Guys Burgers & Fries just opened, and now this) tickles my belly to no end!  Jimmy John's lives up to it's tag line so far, "World's Greatest Gourmet Sandwiches, Since 1983".  I believe they opened yesterday or over the weekend, but we tried them today for lunch for the first time and MAN-OH-MAN, am I happy!!  I went right for the jugular (or large aorta, as it were) with "The J.J. Gargantuan".  Billed as "...huge enough to feed the hungriest of all humans...", this sandwich supreme sated my hunger like no other.  Like most JJ's sandwiches it's served on a deliciously toasty french bread (read hoagie roll), that was perfectly moist on the inside yet flaky crusty on the outside.  This king-sized concoction comes loaded with Genoa salami, smoked ham, capicola, roast beef, turkey & provolone.  I got mine with lettuce, tomato, extra mayo and peppers (like a hoagie should be eaten).  It was AMAZING!  I also ordered a large coke (yes, they have Cherry Coke!!), a pickle (not just a spear, but a HUGE billyclub sized monster spliced in half) and JJ's own brand of Sea Salt & Vinegar chips.  All said (and remember -- I went large for lunch ladies & gents), it put me back a mere $11.69.  The pickle, chips & coke were all extras, so had I just gotten the sammie alone it would have only been $7.25 + tax.    My two petite co-workers went for the #4 Turkey Tom and they were both raving as well.  You can also get any of the sammies as "JJ Unwich" style, meaning no bread -- lettuce wrap.  Cool!  Didn't try the cookies, but they  looked yummy.  You can also buy their day old bread for $0.49!  Fondue anyone?  The staff was super friendly and lived up to the other JJ motto, "Subs so fast you'll freak!"  We are DEF hitting Jimmy John's again soon!

It was my absolute pleasure to be invited as a guest to a client's holiday party at La Hacienda by Richard Sandoval, which is a AAA Four-Diamond-winning restaurant located on the property of the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort.  Everything was just lovely including the location, the service and most of all - the food!  The building itself is built and decorated in a rustic Spanish Mission style, and they've spared no expense with the décor.  You enter through large wooden & glass doors flanked by outdoor seating areas with beautiful gas lamp & glass pebbled fire pits and many free-standing, modern brushed metal gas heaters with dramatic flames shooting up the center glass tubes.  Impressive to say the least until you pass through the doors into the foyer directly in front of  a very modern and visually compelling backlit bar stocked with an impressive collection of high-end tequilas and spirits.  La Hacienda is renowned for its tequila offerings and knowledgeable staff which can recommend any number of fine distilled spirits based on your tastes.  The foyer is bedecked with a massive wrought iron chandelier and flanked by dining areas to the left and the right.  Our party was hosted in a cozy private dining area featuring beautiful French doors and a working fireplace crackling with fragrant, seasoned wood that set the scene for a sophisticated, yet fun dinner with about 30 + people.  The servers were prompt in taking our drink orders and several people at my table got delicious prickly pear margaritas that looked (and apparently tasted - I did not sample them), phenomenal.   Once all the guests arrived we were treated to a magnificent buffet-style dinner that absolutely blew my socks off!  The buffet line itself consisted of over three tables of the best authentic Mexican foods I've ever had.  One table alone was stocked to the gills with homemade salsas tomato and tomatillo of every imaginable kind, pickled onions, vegetable escabeche, shredded Cotija cheese and REAL crema.  The buffet featured authentic quesadillas, enchilada casserole, Mexican rice, epazote-scented black beans, encrusted beef tenderloin, grilled fish, baked clams Veracruzana and my three favorite things that I've been craving for days since the party; an unparalleled mole poblano, a savory shrimp in chipotle-chili sauce exploding with plump, fresh king-sized prawns and an honest-to-God, roast suckling pig!    The mole was the best I've ever had in my life with large pieces of white meat chicken breast, grilled plantains and topped with sesame seeds.  The shrimp chipotle-chili sauce dish was outstanding; the prawns were HUGE and fresh in a light, creamy broth with fresh herbs and spices.  Much to-do was made of the presentation of, and subsequent carving and consumption of the roast suckling pig.  It was carried through the dining room, past the guests, fresh from the kitchen by two chefs proudly holding either end of the huge roasting platter upon which the tasty piggy laid.  Not for the faint of heart, vegetarians or those who prefer not to know where their food comes from - the piglet was roasted whole, about 3 feet long feet to snout, and its roasted crackling skin was sliced open to offer up its delicious, perfectly-seasoned flesh for the eating.  I sampled just about everything on buffet but seriously had no room for seconds. I saved the last ounce of stomach space for a serving for fresh, hot cinnamon churros accompanied by dishes of fresh caramel and cream.  Sheer delight!  All in all it was a wonderful evening that I'm certain was thoroughly enjoyed by all.  My only regret is that I had to say goodbye to that delicious buffet line lovingly prepared and served by La Hacienda staff. Next time I'm invited to "La Ha" I'm lining my purse with aluminum foil and bringing ziplock baggies to abscond with leftovers!

While I can't fit into any of the cool vintage threads Blueberry has to offer, I simply adore this place.  The proprietor, Jessica, is super cool and friendly and I love her unique selection of not only vintage clothes and cards (she has quite the selection of notable teasures), but she also has modern soaps, lotions and potions, make-up & jewelry and some bad-ass local art.  I brought some of my gal pals here with me last weekend during our first annual "Local Holiday Shopping Caravan" and they went nuts for the soap and make-up.    I bought a kick-ass vintage Amish note card with kitschy 1950's clip-art and misogynistic colloquialisms about woman in the kitchen and feeding a man's belly....etc.  Being Penna Dutch myself, this was a little slice of home all they way out in the desert.    I love the gi-huge-ic painting of Elvis on tickets that's framed on the wall and I have to say that Jessica's iPod playing in the store was like me listening to one of my playlists at home. Love that!  Best of all, Blueberry Deluxe's namesake, an adorable, mellow little pug named Blueberry graces the store with her unobtrusive presence and lounges about indulging shoppers with a quick scritch and a belly rub. Free of charge.  If you're into indie boutiques, girly-couture or vintage fashion, Blueberry Deluxe is a must on your next visit to the M7 {Melrose on 7th Ave} nabe.

Worst delivery experience of my life.  I called and ordered 3 SMALL pizzas.  Over $60 for delivery. I called back 2 minutes later to cancel.  Was hung up on twice.  Called again and was put on hold.  I waited 5 minutes.  The girl came back on and asked again if I would hold. I told her I was cancelling my order.  She said OK.  It was cancelled.  Called Pizza Heaven and got the same order $15 cheaper.  Checked my checking account. NYPD still charged me.  I want a refund for pizza I never received.

Like the original Vig in "Arcadia Baja", this newest location is one of my fave, elegant, mature, yet fun places to hang, nosh, nibble and imbibe.  The parking's just as bad (except I like the valets at this location), so you really don't have to worry about it.  Just drop off your keys and go.  This location is decidedly larger, much larger patio, yet retains the cool vibe of the original (except you can actually locomote to the bathroom in this location without spilling someone's drink). The concept scaled well, IMHO.  Food is fantastic.  Everything I've had has been great; innovative pairings of flavors and textures. The happy hour menu changes daily I believe, if not weekly and there's always something adventurous to try.  Full bar and good selection of beers on tap.  I usually get a draft Stella (or 5 ) when I'm there, but you'll not be wont for lack of beverage options.  Best aspects -- a tossup between decor & service. Both are phenomenal.  This is a great place to go with your friends for a weeknite dinner, a special occasion one-on-one or for business meetings with clients.  5 stars all the way.

Quick, honest, friendly, communicative & efficient!  I'd seen his truck around town and the "Honey-Do's" stuck in my mind. I had a minor plumbing issue and called.  The owner Larry is no BS, incredibly funny and very straightforward. No nonsense.  Great sense of humor.  Extremely reasonable rates.  He accommodated my schedule, kept me abreast of what he was doing and communicated throughout the process and got things fixed quickly & efficiently for me.  Anytime I need something done now I'm giving this very "handy" man a shout!

The other half and I eat here fairly regularly and we love it. He's veg and I eat meat and we can both customize our meals the way we like them. Having spent time in Japan, my other half vouches for the food and approximated authenticity here. I don't know authentic Japanese cuisine per se, but I can tell you that a heaping bowl of tonkotsu, the size of my head and then some, definitely fills this big boy's belly every time. I've had the curry bowl as well as the noodles and all are excellent. The shrimp & veggie tempura are great as well and the sweet, dark dipping sauce that accompanies the fried delights also ends up in my soup, to boot. Color me addicted. The staff is young and knowledgeable, and have accommodated some very tricky dietary demands from friends of ours with very specific food allergies.  Best of all, it doesn't cost us an arm & a leg for a hugely satisfying meal. Highly recommended gem of an Asian restaurant in Tempe AZ.

Impeccably clean, modern and classy -- the word buffet needs to be disregarded by those who think of smudgy glass, dirty tables and sub-par food.    The staff was amazingly attentive, super friendly and our server was joking with us and telling stories in her endearing pidgin English.  I actually tipped her a full 20% which is something I'd not normally do at a buffet.    The food was plentiful, well cooked and tasty.  The best part of this place was the sushi bar.  PHENOMENAL!  There's no place else you can go and have all you can eat sushi for $10.98.  Beverages are $1.49 with free refills.  AND they have free WiFi for you business types!  It's a little out of the way for us, but we will surely be back soon!

I went in a few months ago to buy cupcakes for a client gift.  It was the middle of the afternoon and no one was in the shop.  I walked in, looked at some cupcakes in the case and waited for someone to come and greet me.  I waited some more. I shuffled my weight from one foot to the next.  No one came.  I looked thru the window to the back room. A woman saw me but ignored me. I waited another 60 seconds (and yes, I mentally counted 60 seconds in my head) and then walked out.    We now happily get all of our corporate gifts from Urban Cookies (they have excellent cupcakes and more, BTW), and they're happy to speak with us and even make customized boxes with our logo -- for FREE!

Small, simple and accommodating menu.    Excellent service, ambiance and portions = phenomenal value.  I highly recommend the house cheeseburger with "fondue" style cheese sauce, and side of fries.   Perfect date nite with the BF.  We'll be back again soon.

These guys really get video & AV!  I've attended numerous events, annual galas and such where Sonoran handled the video and AV portions of the events; huge happenings with hundreds of attendees and Sonoran Studios hits the mark every time.  Most recently, as a member of the Board of Directors for Tempe Tourism, we were honored, engaged and amused by the amazing video Sonoran Studios produced for the Tempe Tourism Office's 2011 annual breakfast.    I've also hired Sonoran Studios for video production work for my clients.  Their studios are centrally located just off the I-10.  They had everything we needed for a half-day shoot and staffed the shoot appropriately.  They handled all of the post-production work and turned raw video into an amazing spot for my client, complete with music, graphic overlays and they really captured the essence of what we were trying to get across with the video.   The best part is that they get video for web.  Our produced piece was taken directly from them digitally, uploaded to YouTube & other video sites and embedded into the client site within minutes.   All in all, a great little shop with BIG talent, BIG ability and BIG scores on getting the job done right.

I rely on my computer for my profession. My fairly new (1.5 yo) computer was running really slowly and acting funny.  I knew I'd gotten a nasty virus a few months back but I thought i'd wiped that off.  Just to make sure everything was working I contacted Everything Just Works on a friend's recommendation,  to come take a look-see and make sure everything was kosher.    Erik, the owner was very accommodating to my schedule and came out the next day when it made sense for me.  He was very professional from the get-go.  He had me review & sign a legal doc explaining what he would do and/or would not do.   He discussed the situation with me, made an assessment, we reviewed some files on my computer and whether or not I used/needed them and then he went to work and did his magic.    Two swift hours later he left and my computer is purring like a kitten now!  Their pricing is VERY reasonable and I'd hire them again in a heartbeat.

I had never even heard of this place in its current or former incarnation, but fortunately for me a business meeting brought this little loveshack of light and sweetness into my life.  The place is way too hip for its neighboring strip-mall, but inside & out the owners have done a bang-up job with consistent branding, décor and style that is modern, comfortable and accommodating.  They have awesome handmade Etsy-esque business cards.  Very nice touch .  Best of all -- they're  Nutella fiends!!    My business meeting mates got beverages with Nutella in them like a hot Nutella Mocha and something else. I tried them and give this place 4 stars just for innovation and deliciousness alone with those Nutella drinks.  Oh!  They also had a Nutella Cheesecake that looked amazing!  I ordered my standard iced coffee (the barometer by which I judge all java joints), and I augmented my beverage selection with a homemade lemon bar.  The coffee was fantastic, fresh and filled to the brim (like I like it - no HFC sweetener or destruction by dairy for me, TYVM).  The lemon bar was OK.  I was kinda hoping for more lemony flavor, but I have to admit, what it lacked in citrusy sabor, it made up for with the homemade crust.  Buttery AND delicious.   Molto bene!  What I liked best was the staff; excellent, welcoming and attentive  service.  One guy who was on break enjoying his baked goods and brew, moved from where he was sitting so we could push some tables together to accommodate our party of 4.  Super nice of him!  The barista and the (owner?) lady behind the counter were super friendly and helped our gang navigate their broad menu of items. They have baked goods & coffee drinks, natch, but also a selection of sandwiches and salads that looked tempting from the menu board.    The woman behind the bar told me they just opened 3 weeks ago, and they're seemingly still working some things out. What looks to be a killer patio with potted trees and modern metal detailing is taking nice shape outside, although I don't think it's open yet for guests.  It WILL be killer in nice weather, for sure!  We WILL be back for more!

UPDATE!  IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!!  Not only does 32 Shea have THE best beverages in town (my new fave is a slow, gravity dripped iced coffee toddy) and killer pastries & food....they now have a liquor license and serve alcohol; a true bistro!  The outside patio is complete and looks amazing!  These guys are really hitting their stride!  Check 'em out!

This place hits the spot across the board!  Excellent service, delicious food with ample portions and overall cool ambiance!    From the host stand to the servers to the bartenders to the manager on staff, everyone was delightful, helpful and accommodating without being pushy, annoying or interrupting our convo.  Amazing happy hour menu, lovely craft beers on tap, extensive wine list and they make a mean martini!  I love the adaptive re-use of an old service station and how that's incorporated into the overall vibe of the place and the retro brand.  Great job there, Kitchen 56!  Next time I'm I must try their famous burgers (my table-mates raved like religious zealots over them!) and I need to check out the patio for some solid "hang out" time. I mean, that's why we live in the desert, right?  I'll definitely be back and with a pack of friends!

I've been hearing a lot of good stuff about Windsor (especially from my biz partner who is OB-SESSED), so finally hit it up for afternoon cocktails and nibblies last week.  Pretty impressed.  Nice selection of beers (with $5 pitchers of Stella on HH!) and tasty munchies.    We shared the Charcuterie platter which was abundant & well worth the $12.  The pickled veggies are delish!  We also split loaded chips (or whatever they call them).   Tasty and filling.    The bathrooms are unisex & shared with the conjoined ice cream parlour.  Whoever designed them needs to come to my house.  I LOVED them!!  The staff was awesome and very easy on the eyes, as well as attentive and friendly.  The outdoor patio is divine and perfect for AZ weather.  I'll be back again soon!

We eat out frequently and we have our usual fave haunts and places around Phoenix for dinner or weekend eats.  We try different things; a lot of it palatable, most of it good and some of it great.  But when you enjoy a meal that is truly superb, in every sense of the word, it sticks with you.    Superb describes our recent experience at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale.  Located inside the toney Saguaro Hotel (hipster haven and loved it!), Distrito is a lone outpost, holding down the fort in far flung Arizona, leagues from its' Garces Group cousins back east.  I was surprised to learn that Garces Group, which apparently has a stronghold in the Philadelphia and Atlantic City food scenes, has a few outliers here in the Southwest; Distrito & Old Town Whiskey at The Saguaro in Scottsdale and Tonto & El Jefe in the swanky Saguaro Hotel in Palm Springs.  Personally, I'm a big fan of indie & local, but I also think there's  a place for regional chainlets to show their colors.  Garces Croup's Distrito does just that.  Our meal at Distrito was my freshman introduction to the Gacrces Group and man, it made a great first impression on me!  The menu is chock full of small plates and sharing options (as well as as full meals), so we took a snacky approach to dinner.  My other half and I wanted to sample a variety of items from the menu and agreed we'd get more bang for our buck by going micro, rather than limiting ourselves to just an app and a main course.  I'm glad we did!  We started off with the guacamole; a tell-tale bell weather of how the rest of the meal might go at any restaurant, and we were more than delighted with the fresh, hand-hacked guac, dusted with fresh cotija cheese and delicious chips.  We decided to splurge a bit and added the fresh crab (only $5!!!) and didn't regret it for one second. The crab was so fresh, I'd swear we were dining on the beach in the Chesapeake Bay (except we'd never get avocados that fresh in MD), so we were thrilled with the bi-coastal combo!  Moving onto the "Snacks" or Antojitos section, we split an order of Rellenitos.  A clever twist on the classic "Chile Relleno", this bad boy was served sliced , each piece breaded and fried to perfection with the tastiest smoked tomato sofrito I've ever had the pleasure of spooning past my lips.  150% scrumptious!  My other half scarfed Pescado Tacos after the server told him the fish of the day (the species escapes me now) that constituted the fish tacos.  Divine!  We then each split Small Plates of Queso Fundido (with a savory Duck Barbacoa) and Chilpachole de Mariscos; a spicy seafood stew.  My boif loved the Queso (I'm not a huge fan of duck, but it was very tasty) and I laid quick waste to the bowl of Chilpachole,which was chock full of fresh mussels, clams and hand-made masa dumplings.  The stew sauce alone is incomparable and I've been craving a return visit since we ate there, even if just for this dish alone!  Rounding out the extraordinary (and I do not use that word lightly!  This meal was EXTRA-ordinary), I give big props to the staff and service of Distrito Scottsdale.  Our server was adorable, knowledgeable, friendly and quick as a flash with food, drink refills and answering questions for us.  The General Manager Niels even stopped by our table to chat with us, check on everything and make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  That is rare in this day and age and I appreciate the personalized attention, brief and non-intrusive conversation and approachability.  I told him we'd be back and I stay true to my promises.  Apparently Distrito has a revamped menu and is remodeling inside.  If there were one thing I would take points off for, it would and could only be the décor -- in that I was facing a blank wall during dinner. Considering that my attention was fully focused on the fantastic food, savory servings and the company of my adorable other half, I barely even noticed the walls!  I'd like to go back to Distrito soon (even if just for that Chilpachole seasfood stew!!!) and pace myself so I could try their Platos Fuertes (Large Plates) and dessert menu. We never even made it that far because we were STUFFED on apps and small plates. For 2 big boys to not reach dessert phase, you know the portions are generous and the servings substantial.    I'd also like to get a group together some time and give their Taco Bar a try.  It's $25 per person (min 2 peeps) and features an assortment of tasty Latino fare that I'm sure would knock my socks off -- if it's anything like the meal we experienced 2 weeks ago at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale inside The Saguaro Hotel.  Definitely A++, Distrito!

I have to say I'm overwhelmingly surprised myself by the fact that 2 out of my 3 interactions with this location over the past 2 weeks have gone phenomenally well!  After  a bit of a rocky start (this really should've only been 2 visits in the last 2 weeks), today I had an AMAZING experience in-store with La'Tasha Royal.    Today, I was finally able to transfer off of my old corporate account, establish my own billing, activate my new Droid AND La'Tasha and crew also helped me transfer my contacts, apply my new screen skin...etc.  Everyone was super friendly and helpful.  La'Tasha knew her stuff and helped me with poise, grace and a friendly can-do attitude that is often rare from service providers (think about your last dealings with the phone company, cable company or dishwasher repair).  Today was a breeze.  Thank you La'Tasha and everyone else who hooked me up today and made this a simple, easy and actually enjoyable interaction!

Went there on opening day today for lunch as well.  I concur that it was slam-diggity but super well-staffed.  I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly we got in & out on opening day AND it was also the 1st day of the Tempe Festival of the (F)Arts, so it was extra crowded on Mill Ave today.  I have to say I'm stoked there's a new lunch option within 2 minutes walk of my office.  Since the dirty Uno's closed on Halloween my walkable lunch options have been reduced to LaBoca (which I prefer/reserve for drinking  1/2 half off drinks), P. F Chang's & Chili's.....with an occasional jaunt to Z-Tejas or the Tavern on Mill (time permitting, natch).    One of my co-workers is from D.C. and has been wet over 5 guys opening for weeks.  Today we finally got to imbibe & partake of all that is 5 Guys.  The food was excellent. The service was fast & efficient for the crowds they served (so glad they were cognizant & well-prepared for things today -- a true surprise for Mill Ave restaurateurs who typically seem clueless to the community in which the run a business), and frankly I loved the food.  Basic, simple, no BS and plentiful portions.    I got a cheeseburger with ketchup, mayo, lettuce & tomato & was pleasantly surprised to find it was a delicious double pattty upon my return to work with my heavy sack o'goodness.  The fries are flat out phenomenal & today's beauties came from "ground apples" straight outta Shelly, Idaho.  I appreciate the localization of the carb offerings.  They're skin-on, hand-cut beautes fried in peanut oil (as all things there are cooked, apparently), and the fountain cherry Coke capped off my mid-day repas with classic American stylee & finesse.  I went large with lunch (XL coke & XL fries) and my tab was in the $13 dollar range....which is not odd for Mill Ave & I didnt hafta tip, so awesome.  A co-worker went tiny-sized and got a single burger, small fries & a soda for under $10.  I'd definitely return again, but most likely when I'm having a stressful day, require a greazy lunch and should probably take a good walk after lunch.  I will return for fries and want to try the cheese fries and the hot dog selection.  Everyone was super friendly and I applaud the franchisees for doing a bang-up job on staff training, preparedness and efficiency.

Not in the least bit impressed. Dozens of employees moving at a snail's pace behind the counter but nary a customer being helped or served. Had trouble making eye contact, get greeted of have one of the staff take my order even thought I was standing right in front of the register under the order sign. Employees seemed more interested in talking amongst themselves. The apparent manager was complaining to another employee about a previous customer. Decorum & professionalism, please! That's just bad form. Waited 5 minutes for the blandest, crappiest & most expensive egg sandwich I've ever had. I guess when you have a captive market, brand standards, customer service and quality don't matter. Bad move LGO PHX Sky Harbor.

Was craving "the best burger in Phoenix" and polled my network online for recommendations. The Attic came up repeatedly as a reco, so the boif & I decided to make the trek across town to give it a whirl. Amazing burger, although I have to say I think the fries are even better. 100% satisfied and glad we tried something new tonight for dinner. The pizza looked and smelled amazing. May need to return to give that a try!  Of note: Tuesday night is Happy Hour all night with an extensive craft beer selection and discounted apps. Wednesdays are $10 burger + beer special.

I go to this SB's every morning on my way to work. The staff all know me by name, scream good morning to me as I haul my sleepy ass in there every morning and they know what I want and make it fast.  My hat goes off to Misty, Thomas, Jade and all the others who get me in & out as fast as they can and with a smile.

We love having this place in our hood. The owners are super sweet and recognize you as a regular on your second visit. The food is standard diner fare and super filling. The Arbuckles Coffee is outstanding, and I like that they serve RC instead of the "top two". When you eat here, you're supporting a local, indie mom & pop restaurant and investing in your community. I'll take that over a chain any day of the week. A wonderful addition to the M7 community and this diner enriches the CenPho neighborhood in more ways than I can write.  Now, if we could only convince them to go 24 hours, I'd be in hog heaven!

How can you strike and expect $15 an hour when you can't even get an order correct on a slow night when I'm THE ONLY car in he drive thru?  Simple order. Not complicated. You even repeated it back to me and it printed out on my receipt, yet you missed ALL the sauces that were printed on the receipt and half the sandwiches! And then,, you lied to my face and told me that everything was in the bag after I asked. Bullshit.

Five stars on my first visit. I got there before they opened and Roman greeted me and let me in early. Great cut!  Exactly what I wanted and asked for. The shop décor is chill as eff with lots of vintage barbering tools, razors and such in display cases and shadow boxes. Truly a fantastic, gentlemen's barbershop. I will be back next time I'm in town!

Third and final time coming here. Very poorly managed location.  Always lines out the door and in drive-thru because they cannot manage the flow of customers. Employees are nice but don't seem to be trained or know their stations. One employee on register who has to leave, walk away, make drinks and serve  them while numerous other employees bump into one another behind the counter seemingly doing too many things at once. This location needs a visit from corporate.
