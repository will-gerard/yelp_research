Do not get the fish and chips. It was bad. Did I say bad ... It was fucking terrible   ...and they didn't even compensate even though I only ate 3 bites.

Well let's start with the servers they don't know the menu they have no idea how stuff prepared and oh they're really good at mixing up your burger so you get the well-done burger while somebody else gets your medium burger yeah not such a good place to eat I would not recommend it to anyone unless you're in a poor customer service and getting the wrong food and yeah all that good stuff
