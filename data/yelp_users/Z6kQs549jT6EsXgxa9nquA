Every person on this staff truly cares about your pet!  I have never felt rushed and they spend as much time as you need.  Any time your animal gets a prescription for anything or has surgery or whatever, they always call to check up on how they are doing.  While all of the Veterinarians are great, Dr. Serbin is the best!  It's very clean inside.  I have never used their pet boarding but I have used their grooming, which was also great.  Love this place!

Unless your kids play tennis, DON'T go here!  Absolutely NOTHING to do for kids under 14.  BORING!!!!!!  Basketball court is taken by adults.  Kids play area is sometimes used as a boot camp room.  It has no video games, no ping pong, no 4-square area, no computer stations, nothing!  Very over priced for what you get in a family membership.

This is a great restaurant/bar!  I usually go with my boyfriend but sometimes we bring our kids AND our DOG!  When there is no kids with us, we sit inside and watch sports with TV's everywhere!  If kids are with us, we can enjoy playing some of the games that are separated from the bar (darts, pool, shuffle board, etc.).  And we especially love going with our dog on the patio.  They bring water bowls and treats out for them and there is usually other people with their pets as well.  The food is really good!  I love the Ruben and their Jamaican Salad but honestly, I haven't had anything I didn't like.  Plenty of beers on tap.  Prices are good. Restaurant is always busy and laid out nicely.  And finally, if you've had too much to drink, they have a free cab service right outside the bar.  You can't beat that!

This is such a nice hike.  If you go to the absolute top it's about 1.34 miles.  It took me 30 minutes to go up.  It starts off pretty easy and gets harder as you go.  You an make it as easy or as hard as you want by your pace.  It's not crowded and they allow dogs.

I would have given this 3 stars up until the other night only because the food is good, atmosphere is good and you can bring your family there.  I noticed they raised the prices by a lot!  A burger is $12.  If you want their "famous" tater tots, it is now $2 more!!!  It is $15 for a Philly Cheesesteak!  Don't forget, if you want tater tots, that comes to $17!!!  ABSURD!  They raised the kids meals to $6.  If you go during Happy Hour, that only applies if you are sitting on the bar side, not the restaurant side.  And you are forced to valet park unless you want to walk a ways from the Safeway parking lot caddy corner.  My boyfriend dreads it when one particular bartender is working because she always appears to be annoyed when you ask for something.  Half the time the service is good but the other half the time, slow, forgetful and too busy.  One final observation, they are a Saints bar ... very uncomfortable on football days.

I have been getting my nails done at different places for over 20 years.  HANDS DOWN, this place is #1!  Everyone is VERY friendly.  They super serve you with ice cold water bottles.  They have flat screen tvs to watch, chairs are spectacular, interior is nice.  Amy, one of the owners I think, always greets me, says goodbye and knows my name.  Every technician I get (and I've been there over 200 times), is good!  They all care about the final result.  They are respectful when you are not up for talking and love to talk when you are up for it.  They have a TON of nail polish/gel to choose from.  Also, there eye brow waxing is every bit as good as anywhere else!  I highly recommend this place!

The food is AMAZINGLY good!!!  I crave this place all the time!  Portions appear small but somehow I always feel full.  I recommend the Pesto pasta and the Short Braised Pasta.  This isn't your typical italian at all!  The atmosphere is great!  You can see the chefs cooking in their open kitchen.  The layout of the whole restaurant is nice too.  Only thing I don't like is unless you want to walk from across the street, you are forced to valet park ... not my style.

If you have TMJ, don't go here!  They will "rope you in" and NOTHING will be covered by insurance!  Then, they convince you to sign up for Care Credit.  Just a consultation is $300!  RIDICULOUS!  They convince you to get a CT for another $300!  After that they give you the entire low down on how much it will cost ... $3,780!  YIKES!  And after you go through three months of treatment, it's $2,800 more for Botox injections in your jaw, which you may need more treatments in the future.  This is a grand total of $6,580 and it's not guaranteed to work!  Not once did they try and explore options to see if they work first, for instance using their $2,800 splints before treatment.  Which by the way ... who charges $1,400 for ONE splint?  Absurd!!!  I've been to another doctor since and they are way more caring about finances and are not in it for JUST money!  This guy is full of himself because he's been on "Your Life A to Z" ... big deal, who cares!  All this Dr. Stan Farrell wants is your money!!!  Do yourself a favor and research other doctors first!

I responded to their TV / Advertisement on Channel 3.  It was $99 for the evaluation and then you get a $100 Visa gift card (which I never received), and a bag from SRP with some energy saving items in it.  The technician that did the inspection did a decent job but I felt he missed some areas of my house (or he just missed an area of my house that I know is problematic).  But, he made a few basic recommendations which helped a lot.  He was very nice!  Then, the sales person comes over a week later.  I was told it would save all this money if I spent about $5,500 - $7,500 to blow in insualtion, seal small holes, etc.  And, if I did that I would receive tax credit and blah blah blah ....  Here's where I had the problem.  The salesperson that came over was a pretty unprofessional in her appearance (like she just got off the couch), knowledge (felt like she was reading off the screen) and presentation (on a yellow pad).  I was less than impressed.  I never received a formal bid in writing nor via email (like they promised).  To say the least, I wasn't going to do any work without that.

We went there on a Tuesday night and it was pretty full. Our waiter was awesome, super serving!. He knew the menu quite well and gave us great recommendations! We had the braised ribs and a pizza. We also had the baked olive appetizer, delicious! The outside of the building is nothing like the inside, looks are deceiving! We will most definitely go back!

I really like this place. I often office here for the day. The Turkey French Dip and Kale Slaw is my favorite lunch. Le Pig is my favorite breakfast meal. Good atmosphere.  Be prepared to wait during hot peak times.

Had to leave before I could order. Waited in line for 30 minutes and didn't move.  Had I stayed, guarantee it would have been 30 minutes longer.  Maybe if they served drinks while in line, it would help the wait time. Not sure how the food is. Hesitant to go back.
